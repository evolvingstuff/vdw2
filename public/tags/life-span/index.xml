&lt;p>I prepared this bibliography in order to see the level of acceptance for vitamin D affecting health outcomes for black Americans. (I omitted papers on bone health.) My impression is that it is not very well accepted. One reason given by researchers is that most of the vitamin D studies were performed on white, not black people. Another likely reason is that most of the studies are ecological or observational in nature, not from clinical trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pregnancy and Vitamin D bibliography - Dr. Grant</title><link>/posts/pregnancy-and-vitamin-d-bibliography-dr-grant.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pregnancy-and-vitamin-d-bibliography-dr-grant.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>RDA (minimum) says 220 ug of Iodine during pregnancy and 290 ug during breastfeeding&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Many prenatal vitamins contain ZERO Iodine&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Iodine is particularly needed in first 3 months of pregnancy, but some women do not start prenatal vitamins that early&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Consensus: no best way to test for Iodine Deficiency&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disagree: &amp;gt;150 ug is needed during pregnancy, &amp;gt; 250 ug is needed&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Disagree: Iodine loading is possible (otherwise it takes 9-12 months to restore levels)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Natural variation in mineral content of a food is typically 3 to 1</title><link>/posts/natural-variation-in-mineral-content-of-a-food-is-typically-3-to-1.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/natural-variation-in-mineral-content-of-a-food-is-typically-3-to-1.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="mineral-nutrient-composition--of-vegetables-fruits-and-grains-the-context-of-reports-of-apparent-historical-declines">Mineral nutrient composition of vegetables, fruits and grains: The context of reports of apparent historical declines&lt;/h4>

&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-mimics-low-calorie-diets">VITAMIN D MIMICS LOW-CALORIE DIETS&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In addition to increasing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation to diminish fat, vitamin D3 also has the rather unique capacity to mimic low caloric consumption, further driving fat loss. This effect was shown in the afore-mentioned study by Chang et al. &lt;strong>10&lt;/strong> , which found that vitamin D3 activated the molecule SIRT1 an energy-sensing enzyme normally activated by low caloric intake, but in this case, SIRT1 was activated by vitamin D3 intake. Interestingly, in order to trigger SIRT1 function, vitamin D3 increased production of the molecule NAD, which is a compound that represents a low energy state within the cell, which therefore turns on SIRT1. As a result, SIRT1 immediately activates several enzymes that oxidize fatty acids for the replenishment of cellular energy, which also diminishes body fat. Vitamin D3 also cranked up expression of the SIRT1 gene, which likely further enhanced SIRT1-driven fatty acid oxidation and fat loss. In addition, an activated SIRT1 also multiplies the number of mitochondrion within the cell. Since mitochondria function as power generators that burn fat and sugar for energy, more mitochondrion provides fat cells with an even greater capacity to scorch body fat. Taken together, this data indicates that vitamin D3 activation of the NAD-SIRT1 pathway potently contributes to the overall ability of vitamin D to reduce fat mass. SIRT1 can also be activated by resveratrol supplementation, producing favorable effects on body fat composition that are quite similar to vitamin D. Interestingly, recent research showed that resveratrol also stimulates vitamin D3 binding to the vitamin D receptor and the subsequent activation of SIRT1 in certain human cells types in vitro12, implying that the combination of resveratrol with vitamin D3 would be a potent fat-burning stack that should conceivably activate SIRT1 more extensively, generating even more fat loss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Less than 900 IU of Vitamin D and Calcium do not cause cardiovascular problems</title><link>/posts/less-than-900-iu-of-vitamin-d-and-calcium-do-not-cause-cardiovascular-problems.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/less-than-900-iu-of-vitamin-d-and-calcium-do-not-cause-cardiovascular-problems.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="lack-of-evidence-linking-calcium-with-or-without-vitamin-d-supplementation-to-cardiovascular-disease-in-generally-healthy-adults-a-clinical-guideline-from-the-national-osteoporosis-annals-of-internal-medicine">Lack of Evidence Linking Calcium With or Without Vitamin D Supplementation to Cardiovascular Disease in Generally Healthy Adults: A Clinical Guideline From the National Osteoporosis Annals of Internal Medicine,&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Mounting evidence from observational and clinical trials indicates that optimal vitamin D reduces the risk of many diseases. We used observational studies and recent data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> concentrations of Canadians from Cycle 3 of the Canadian Health Measures Survey to estimate the reduction in disease incidence, mortality rates, and the total economic burden (direct plus indirect) of disease if 25(OH)D concentrations of all Canadians were raised to or above 100 nmol/L. Recently, the mean 25(OH)D concentration of Canadians varied depending on age and season (51–69 nmol/L), with an overall mean of 61 nmol/L.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Asthma severe when both Vitamin D AND Magnesium are low</title><link>/posts/asthma-severe-when-both-vitamin-d-and-magnesium-are-low.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/asthma-severe-when-both-vitamin-d-and-magnesium-are-low.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>Background and aims&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in stroke survivors. Observational studies have reported an association of low vitamin D levels with greater stroke severity, poststroke mortality and functional disability. Randomised clinical trials are lacking. We sought to assess the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in ischaemic stroke survivors with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency on disability/mortality outcomes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Permethrin-dipped clothing kills Zika mosquitoes even after 10 washings</title><link>/posts/permethrin-dipped-clothing-kills-zika-mosquitoes-even-after-10-washings.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/permethrin-dipped-clothing-kills-zika-mosquitoes-even-after-10-washings.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="permethrin-treated-clothing-as-protection-against-the-dengue-vector-aedes-aegypti-extent-and-duration-of-protection">Permethrin-Treated Clothing as Protection against the Dengue Vector, Aedes aegypti: Extent and Duration of Protection&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In 1822, a Polish physician was the first to publish that sunlight could cure the vitamin D deficiency disease rickets. His work was ignored by mainstream medicine for a century, not coming into widespread use until the 20th century, when wire cages were affixed to tenement buildings so babies could benefit from the sun. Are we in a similar situation now, where the medical profession has just not caught up with the science?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twice as likely to die during neurological critical care if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/twice-as-likely-to-die-during-neurological-critical-care-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/twice-as-likely-to-die-during-neurological-critical-care-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="a-prospective-analysis-of-hypovitaminosis-d-and-mortality-in-400-patients-in-the-neurocritical-care-setting">A prospective analysis of hypovitaminosis D and mortality in 400 patients in the neurocritical care setting.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVE Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent among the general population. Studies have shown an association between hypovitaminosis D and multiple negative outcomes in critical care patients, but there has been no prospective evaluation of vitamin D in the neurological critical care population. The authors examined the impact of vitamin D deficiency on in-hospital mortality and a variety of secondary outcomes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If having twins, need more vitamin D</title><link>/posts/if-having-twins-need-more-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/if-having-twins-need-more-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Zika virus has emerged as a severe health threat with a rapidly expanding range. The IFITM family of restriction factors inhibits the replication of a broad range of viruses, including the closely related flaviruses West Nile virus and dengue virus. Here, we show that &lt;span style="color:#F00;">IFITM1 and IFITM3 inhibit Zika virus infection early in the viral life cycle&lt;/span>. Moreover, IFITM3 can prevent Zika-virus-induced cell death. These results suggest that strategies to boost the actions and/or levels of the IFITMs might be useful for inhibiting a broad range of emerging viruses.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>18 fewer hospital days if given 500,000 IU of vitamin D while ventilated in ICU – RCT</title><link>/posts/18-fewer-hospital-days-if-given-500000-iu-of-vitamin-d-while-ventilated-in-icu-rct.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/18-fewer-hospital-days-if-given-500000-iu-of-vitamin-d-while-ventilated-in-icu-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="high-dose-vitamin-d-administration-in-ventilated-intensive-care-unit-patients-a-pilot-double-blind-randomized-control-trial">High dose vitamin D administration in ventilated intensive care unit patients: A pilot double blind randomized control trial&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Evidence for the usefulness of using vitamin D to treat ‘renal bone disease’ is now nearly six decades old. In regular clinical practice, however, it is more like three decades, at most, that we have routinely been using vitamin D to try to prevent, or reverse, the impact of hyperparathyroidism on the skeleton of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The practice has been in the main to use high doses of synthetic vitamin D compounds, not naturally occurring ones. However, the pharmacological impacts of the different vitamin D species and of their different modes, and styles of administration cannot be assumed to be uniform across the spectrum. It is disappointingly true to say that even in 2016 there is a remarkable paucity of evidence concerning the clinical benefits of vitamin D supplementation to treat vitamin D insufficiency in patients with stage 3b–5 CKD. This is even more so if we consider the non-dialysis population. While there are a number of studies that report the impact of vitamin D supplementation on serum vitamin D concentrations (unsurprisingly, usually reporting an increase), and some variable evidence of parathyroid hormone concentration suppression, there has been much less focus on hard or semi-rigid clinical end point analysis (e.g. fractures, hospitalizations and overall mortality). Now, in 2016, with the practice pattern changes of first widespread clinical use of vitamin D and second widespread supplementation of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol by patients (alone, or as multivitamins), it is now, in my view, next to impossible to run a placebo-controlled trial over a decent period of time, especially one which involved clinically meaningful (fractures, hospitalisation, parathyroidectomy, death) end-points. In this challenging situation, we need to ask what it is we are trying to achieve here, and how best to balance potential benefits with potential harm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Infectious diseases and vitamin D – update</title><link>/posts/infectious-diseases-and-vitamin-d-update.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/infectious-diseases-and-vitamin-d-update.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="an-update-on-the-association-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-with-common-infectious-diseases">An update on the association of vitamin D deficiency with common infectious diseases.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D plays an important role in modulating the immune response to infections. Deficiency of vitamin D is a common condition, affecting both the general population and patients in health care facilities. Over the last decade, an increasing body of evidence has shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk for acquiring several infectious diseases, as well as poorer outcomes in vitamin D deficient patients with infections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dengue Fever associated with poor vitamin D receptor</title><link>/posts/dengue-fever-associated-with-poor-vitamin-d-receptor.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dengue-fever-associated-with-poor-vitamin-d-receptor.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="susceptibility-to-dengue-hemorrhagic-fever-in-vietnam-evidence-of-an-association-with-variation-in-the-vitamin-d-receptor-and-fc-gamma-receptor-iia-genes">Susceptibility to dengue hemorrhagic fever in vietnam: evidence of an association with variation in the vitamin d receptor and Fc gamma receptor IIa genes.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Dengue is an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics, with more than a billion people at risk each year. Immunologic enhancement is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis. Only a very small proportion of infected individuals develop life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). In a large case-control study with 400 DHF patients and 300 matched controls, we have assessed five polymorphic non-HLA host genetic factors that might influence susceptibility to DHF. The less frequent t allele of a variant at position 352 of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene was associated with resistance to severe dengue (P = 0.03). Homozygotes for the arginine variant at position 131 of the Fc gammaRIIA gene, who have less capacity to opsonize IgG2 antibodies, may also be protected from DHF (one-tailed P = 0.03). No associations were found with polymorphisms in the mannose binding lectin, interleukin-1 (IL-4), and IL-1 receptor antagonist genes. Further studies to confirm these associations are warranted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reduced palliative cancer pain after Vitamin D supplementation</title><link>/posts/reduced-palliative-cancer-pain-after-vitamin-d-supplementation.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/reduced-palliative-cancer-pain-after-vitamin-d-supplementation.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-patients-with-palliative-cancer">Vitamin D and patients with palliative cancer&lt;/h3>

However, for more than 40 years the lay press and various medical and dermatology associations have denounced sun exposure because of its association with increased risk for skin cancer.

&lt;p>The purpose of this review is to examine vitamin D in the context of sport nutrition and its potential role in optimizing athletic performance. Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and vitamin D response elements (VDREs) are located in almost every tissue within the human body including skeletal muscle. The hormonally-active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has been shown to play critical roles in the human body and regulates over 900 gene variants. Based on the literature presented, it is plausible that vitamin D levels above the normal reference range (up to 100 nmol/L) might increase skeletal muscle function, decrease recovery time from training, increase both force and power production, and increase testosterone production, each of which could potentiate athletic performance. Therefore, maintaining higher levels of vitamin D could prove beneficial for athletic performance. Despite this situation, large portions of athletic populations are vitamin D deficient. Currently, the research is inconclusive with regards to the optimal intake of vitamin D, the specific forms of vitamin D one should ingest, and the distinct nutrient-nutrient interactions of vitamin D with vitamin K that affect arterial calcification and hypervitaminosis. Furthermore, it is possible that dosages exceeding the recommendations for vitamin D (i.e. dosages up to 4000-5000 IU/day), in combination with 50 to 1000 mcg/day of vitamin K1 and K2 could aid athletic performance. This review will investigate these topics, and specifically their relevance to athletic performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prostate Cancer long term survival 1.7 X more likely if high level of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/prostate-cancer-long-term-survival-17-x-more-likely-if-high-level-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/prostate-cancer-long-term-survival-17-x-more-likely-if-high-level-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="circulating-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-prostate-cancer-survival">Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and prostate cancer survival.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Cardiovascular (CV) calcification is known as sub-clinical atherosclerosis and is recognised as a predictor of CV events and mortality. As yet there is no treatment for CV calcification and conventional CV risk factors are not consistently correlated, leaving clinicians uncertain as to optimum management for these patients. For this reason, a review of studies investigating diet and serum levels of macro- and micronutrients was carried out. Although there were few human studies of macronutrients, nevertheless transfats and simple sugars should be avoided, while long chain ω-3 fats from oily fish may be protective. Among the micronutrients, an intake of 800 μg/day calcium was beneficial in those without renal disease or hyperparathyroidism, while&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Cancer Screening Has Never Saved Lives' (but Vitamin D supplementation does)</title><link>/posts/cancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-but-vitamin-d-supplementation-does.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-but-vitamin-d-supplementation-does.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="greenmedinfohttpwwwgreenmedinfocomblogcancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-bmj-study-concludes-1-jan-2016">&lt;a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-bmj-study-concludes-1">GreenMedInfo&lt;/a> Jan 2016&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Abstract: The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the nutrient intake considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of 97.5% of the population. Recent reports revealed a statistical error in the calculation of the RDA for vitamin D opening the question of what the recommendation should be. We took a dual approach to answer this question: (1) we aggregated &lt;strong>108 published estimates&lt;/strong> on vitamin D supplementation and vitamin D status; and (2) we analyzed &lt;strong>13,987 observations of program participants&lt;/strong> . The aggregation of published data revealed that&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Much higher hospital costs (ICU and pneumonia) if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/much-higher-hospital-costs-icu-and-pneumonia-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/much-higher-hospital-costs-icu-and-pneumonia-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="1300-economic-impact-of-vitamin-d-levels-less-than-18-ngml-on-hospitals-and-third-party-payers">1300: ECONOMIC IMPACT OF VITAMIN D LEVELS LESS THAN 18 NG/ML ON HOSPITALS AND THIRD PARTY PAYERS&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Learning Objectives: Vitamin D3 levels less than 18 ng/ml is associated with increased mortality rate of 30% from all causes. The economic impact of vitamin D3 deficiency has been unknown. We hypothesize that a vitamin D3 less than 18 ng/ml increases the financial burden on hospitals in terms of ICU cost, Hospital ward cost, ventilated associated pneumonias, myocardial infarctions, and total hospital days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D response reduced if taken with Calcium – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-response-reduced-if-taken-with-calcium-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-response-reduced-if-taken-with-calcium-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-vitamin-d-or-activated-vitamin-d-on-circulating-125-dihydroxyvitamin-d-concentrations-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis-of-randomized-controlled-trials">Effect of Vitamin D or Activated Vitamin D on Circulating 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Concentrations: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus that can lead to a syndrome of acquired immune dysfunction. Infected cats often remain asymptomatic for several years before immune dysfunction leads to an increased risk for the development of systemic diseases, neoplasia and opportunistic infections. FIV is structurally related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the pathogenesis of FIV-related disease is similar to that seen in HIV-infected patients. Observational studies have documented an association between low plasma vitamin D and HIV infection. Vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with HIV-related disease progression, morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that vitamin D status, as assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> concentrations, are lower in cats with FIV infection compared to healthy control cats. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in 20 healthy cats, 39 hospitalized ill cats and 59 cats infected with FIV. Cats which were FIV infected had significantly lower 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control cats. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were not significantly different between FIV-infected cats and hospitalized ill cats. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether vitamin D status influences the prognosis of cats infected with FIV.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CYP2R1 and GC variations decrease vitamin D response – PHD thesis</title><link>/posts/cyp2r1-and-gc-variations-decrease-vitamin-d-response-phd-thesis.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cyp2r1-and-gc-variations-decrease-vitamin-d-response-phd-thesis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="common-genetic-variations-in-the-cyp2r1-and-gc-genes-are-determinants-of-vitamin-d-status-in-danes">Common genetic variations in the CYP2R1 and GC genes are determinants of vitamin D status in Danes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is considered a key fat-soluble vitamin critically important for good bone- and overall health throughout life. Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis, and moreover increases the risk of various non-skeletal adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, some cancers and overall mortality. In humans, vitamin D is mainly synthesized in the skin after solar exposure and only a small amount is obtained through the diet. An inter-individual variation in vitamin D status exists, which may be explained by genetic variation in vitamin D modulating genes. Twin and family-based studies indicate that genetic variation may have an appreciable influence on vitamin D status. Moreover, several candidate gene studies including two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, C10orf88, DHCR7/NADSYN1, GC and VDR genes to be associated with vitamin D status. The main hypothesis of this work was that genetically determined variation in vitamin D metabolism would influence the effect of vitamin D sources (vitamin D-supplementation and ultraviolet (UV)-B) on vitamin D status. This was done by assessing the association between 25 SNPs located in the CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP27B1, C10orf88, DHCR7/NADSYN1, GC and VDR genes and vitamin D status in &lt;strong>756 participants&lt;/strong> in the VitmaD study in late summer (paper I), at the end of a winter season (paper II), after 6 months intake of vitamin D3-fortified bread and milk (paper II) and in 92 participants in the VitDgen study after artificial UVB irradiation during winter (paper III). Common genetic variations in the CYP2R1 and GC genes were found to be important determinants of vitamin D status in three out of four scenarios:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Single Most Crucial Nutrient Your Body Craves (Vitamin D) - Mercola</title><link>/posts/the-single-most-crucial-nutrient-your-body-craves-vitamin-d-mercola.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-single-most-crucial-nutrient-your-body-craves-vitamin-d-mercola.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="mercolahttpproductsmercolacomvitamin-d-spraye_cid20151113z1_dnl_yrp_1utm_sourcednlutm_mediumemailutm_contentyrp1utm_campaign20151113z1et_ciddm90184et_rid1213868658">&lt;a href="http://products.mercola.com/vitamin-d-spray/?e_cid=20151113Z1_DNL_YRP_1&amp;amp;utm_source=dnl&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=yrp1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=20151113Z1&amp;amp;et_cid=DM90184&amp;amp;et_rid=1213868658">Mercola&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are commonly treated with vitamin D analogs, such as calcitriol. Recent epidemiological evidence revealed a significant interaction between vitamin D and magnesium, since an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality mainly occurs in patients with a high magnesium intake. The aim of the study was to assess the mechanisms involved by determining whether magnesium alone or combined with calcitriol treatments differentially impact vascular calcification (VC) in male Sprague-Dawley rats with adenine-induced CKD. Treatment with moderate doses of calcitriol (80ug/kg) suppressed PTH to near or slightly below control levels. Given alone, this dose of calcitriol increased the prevalence of VC; but when magnesium was given in combination, the severity of calcification was attenuated in the abdominal aorta (51% reduction), iliac (44%) and carotid arteries (46%) compared to CKD controls. The decreases in vascular calcium content were associated with 20-50% increase in vascular Mg. Calcitriol treatment alone significantly decreased TRPM7 protein (↓ to ~11%) whereas the combination treatment increased both the mRNA (1.7X) and protein (6.8X) expression compared to calcitriol alone. In summary, calcitriol increased VC in certain conditions; but magnesium prevented the reduction in TRPM7 and reduced the severity of VC, thereby increasing the bioavailable magnesium in the vascular microenvironment. These findings suggest that modifying the adverse effect profile of calcitriol with Mg may be a plausible approach to benefiting the increasing number of CKD patients being prescribed calcitriol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Infant in ICU much more likely to die if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/infant-in-icu-much-more-likely-to-die-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/infant-in-icu-much-more-likely-to-die-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-and-critical-illness">Vitamin D Deficiency and Critical Illness&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body. It has been recognized as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymatic reactions, where it is crucial for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism. Magnesium is required for DNA and RNA synthesis, reproduction, and protein synthesis. Moreover, magnesium is essential for the regulation of muscular contraction, blood pressure, insulin metabolism, cardiac excitability, vasomotor tone, nerve transmission and neuromuscular conduction. Imbalances in magnesium status—primarily hypomagnesemia as it is seen more common than hypermagnesemia—might result in unwanted neuromuscular, cardiac or nervous disorders. Based on magnesium&amp;rsquo;s many functions within the human body, it plays an important role in prevention and treatment of many diseases. Low levels of magnesium have been associated with a number of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke), migraine headaches, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D does not improve cancer survival much – when dose size, etc. is ignored</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-does-not-improve-cancer-survival-much-when-dose-size-etc-is-ignored.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-does-not-improve-cancer-survival-much-when-dose-size-etc-is-ignored.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-effect-of-pre-diagnostic-vitamin-d-supplementation-on-cancer-survival-in-women-a-cohort-study-within-the-uk-clinical-practice-research-datalink">The effect of pre-diagnostic vitamin D supplementation on cancer survival in women: a cohort study within the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>First described in relation to musculoskeletal disease, there is accumulating data to suggest that vitamin D may play an important role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review we aim to provide an overview of the role of vitamin D status as both a marker of and potentially causative agent of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. The role of vitamin D levels as a disease marker for all-cause mortality is also discussed. We review the current knowledge gathered from experimental studies, observational studies, randomised controlled trials, and subsequent systematic reviews in order to suggest the optimal vitamin D level for CVD protection.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D meta-analyses often disagree due to selection of: trial, data extraction, statistics, etc.</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-meta-analyses-often-disagree-due-to-selection-of-trial-data-extraction-statistics-etc.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-meta-analyses-often-disagree-due-to-selection-of-trial-data-extraction-statistics-etc.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#F00;">A Case Study of Discordant Overlapping Meta-Analyses: Vitamin D Supplements and Fracture&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Background: Overlapping meta-analyses on the same topic are now very common, and discordant results often occur. To explore why discordant results arise, we examined a common topic for overlapping meta-analyses- vitamin D supplements and fracture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods and Findings: We identified 24 meta-analyses of vitamin D (with or without calcium) and fracture in a PubMed search in October 2013, and analysed a sample of 7 meta-analyses in the highest ranking general medicine journals. We used the AMSTAR tool to assess the quality of the meta-analyses, and compared their methodologies, analytic techniques and results. Applying the AMSTAR tool suggested the meta-analyses were generally of high quality. Despite this, there were important differences in trial selection, data extraction, and analytical methods that were only apparent after detailed assessment. 25 trials were included in at least one meta-analysis. Four meta-analyses included all eligible trials according to the stated inclusion and exclusion criteria, but the other 3 meta-analyses “missed” between 3 and 8 trials, and 2 meta-analyses included apparently ineligible trials. The relative risks used for individual trials differed between meta-analyses for total fracture in 10 of 15 trials, and for hip fracture in 6 of 12 trials, because of different outcome definitions and analytic approaches. The majority of differences (11/16) led to more favourable estimates of vitamin D efficacy compared to estimates derived from unadjusted intention-to-treat analyses using all randomised participants. The conclusions of the meta-analyses were discordant, ranging from strong statements that vitamin D prevents fractures to equally strong statements that vitamin D without calcium does not prevent fractures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Colon Cancer 20 percent more likely if low Magnesium</title><link>/posts/colon-cancer-20-percent-more-likely-if-low-magnesium.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/colon-cancer-20-percent-more-likely-if-low-magnesium.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="association-between-magnesium-intake-and-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-among-postmenopausal-women">Association between magnesium intake and risk of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Psychiatric disorders in general, and major depression and anxiety disorders in particular, account for a large burden of disability, morbidity and premature mortality worldwide. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a range of neurobiological activities in modulation of neurotransmitters, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and neuroplasticity, which could contribute to psychotropic effects. Here we reviewed recent research on the benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplements in prevention against major depression, bipolar disorders, interferon-α-induced depression patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection, and &lt;strong>posttraumatic stress disorder&lt;/strong> . The biological mechanisms underlying omega-3 PUFAs&amp;rsquo;psychotropic effects are proposed and reviewed. Nutrition is a modifiable environmental factor that might be important in prevention medicine, which have been applied for many years in the secondary prevention of heart disease with omega-3 PUFAs. This review extends the notion that nutrition in psychiatry is a modifiable environmental factor and calls for more researches on prospective clinical studies to justify the preventive application of omega-3 PUFAs in daily practice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Receptor</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-receptor.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-receptor.html</guid><description>&lt;ol>

&lt;p>The vitamin D endocrine system regulates a broad variety of independent biological processes, and its deficiency is associated with rickets, bone diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and tuberculosis. Cellular and molecular studies have also shown that it is implicated in the suppression of cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Sunlight exposure and consequent increased circulating levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced occurrence and a reduced mortality in different histological types of cancer, including those resident in the skin, prostate, breast, colon, ovary, kidney, and bladder. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a steroid hormone superfamily of nuclear receptors is highly expressed in epithelial cells at risk for carcinogenesis, providing a direct molecular link by which vitamin D status impacts on carcinogenesis. Because VDR expression is retained in many human tumors, vitamin D status may be an important modulator of cancer progression in persons living with cancer. The aim of this review is to highlight the relationship between vitamin D, VDR, and cancer, summarizing several mechanisms proposed to explain the potential protective effect of vitamin D against the development and progression of cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gut microbiome massively changed by weekly vitamin D</title><link>/posts/gut-microbiome-massively-changed-by-weekly-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/gut-microbiome-massively-changed-by-weekly-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

In this article I will discuss a recent headline-grabbing editorial that was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine that reviewed three studies on the topic of multivitamins and chronic disease prevention. The editorial, is titled: __Enough is Enough: Stop Wasting Money on Vitamin and Mineral Supplements__, and its purpose was to serve as a direct call to action for medical professionals to advise against the daily use of vitamin and mineral supplements and for scientists to stop further research into the potential benefits of supplements.

Watch the video here: [http://youtu.be/o0u8UdZeOhc]

This editorial ignored decades of well-done nutrition research that has shown that supplementing appropriate levels of micronutrients (such as vitamin D, B vitamins, and omega-3s) are extremely helpful in preventing disease and decreasing all-cause mortality primarily due to widespread dietary inadequacy of essential vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. According to a NHANES and CDC report published in 2012, the percentage of adults in the US that do not take vitamin and mineral supplements and fall below the estimated average requirement for vitamin and minerals are the following:
*96% for vitamin D (1)
*48% for vitamin C (1)
*96% for vitamin E (1)
*58% for vitamin A (1)
Now compare this to the percentage of Adults in the US who do routinely use multivitamin supplements, in these cases:
*25% for vitamin D (1)
*3% for Vitamin C (1)
*5% for Vitamin E (1)
*2% for Vitamin A (1)
These data demonstrate that many US adults are not getting adequate levels of important vitamins from their diet and vitamin/mineral supplements help to fill these nutritional gaps at a low cost.

The misleading editorial was broken down into three specific categories:
*Effects on cancer incidence and other age-related diseases
*Effects on cognition and cognitive decline
*Effects on cardiovascular disease
The final conclusion of the editorial was that vitamin/mineral supplements were functionally ineffective or, worse yet, deleterious in their effects in all three categories.

This editorial covered one meta-analysis including multiple studies and two other studies. I identified a few common methodological problems with these studies, which the authors relied upon as their supporting evidence. These problems were the following: 

Lack of any objective biochemical analyses on vitamin and mineral levels in plasma or blood cells either at baseline (before treatment) or at the follow-up (after the treatment).
In many cases, the study population was severely deficient in a particular micronutrient and at the end of the trial they were still deficient, meaning the vitamin/mineral dose in the treatment group was inadequate.
Dose being often extremely inadequate or conversely, excessively high.
Study participants being already in an advanced diseased state (which is funny, since the editorial emphasized multivitamins had no effect on prevention).
Some of these studies included meta-analyses, which consisted of multiple studies some of which had positive findings, which were left out and not mentioned in the editorial. I feel that this point, in particular, demonstrates overt bias by the editorial's authors.

__Let's begin with the effects on cancer incidence:__
Out of eleven studies analyzed, two studies showed a protective effect of multivitamin or calcium supplementation on cancer incidence, of course the positive effects were not mentioned in the attention-grabbing editorial. One study began with a severely vitamin D deficient population of women (12 ng/ml) and at the end of the study women had only raised their vitamin D levels (23 ng/ml) from severely deficient to just deficient (2). If you are designing a clinical trial with vitamin D and your population is severely deficient then you should aim at giving the treatment group a dose high enough that will get them up to adequate serum levels of vitamin D, which is generally considered to be above 30 ng/ml.

Several of the studies did not measure the vitamin and mineral levels at baseline or at follow-up; therefore, negative data (meaning no effect on cancer incidence) is meaningless and no conclusions can be made. While the majority of studies included in this particular meta-analysis involved diseased individuals the editorial claimed that vitamins and minerals have no effect on cancer prevention. This is misleading as a very small percentage of these studies looked at cancer prevention and actually had biochemical evidence that treatment worked and those studies found that multivitamin protected against cancer incidence in men but not women (2).When we examine the data we see the reason there was no effect in women is because the plasma levels of vitamins and minerals were the same in the placebo compared to the treatment group, so of course supplementation did not show an effect compared to placebo if their levels of the micronutrient were the same between the two groups. If there were no biochemical data in this study it would not have been possible to understand why there was a protective effect in men but not women. This really highlights the importance of biochemical endpoints to quantify the effectiveness of treatment as well as compliance. For those studies with no quantification of any biochemical data, there can be no conclusions made. I cannot emphasize this enough.

Some of studies included in this meta-analysis also started with a population of individuals that were in an early or late stage of cancer and found that giving them a high dose of particular vitamins namely folate or vitamin A actually accelerated the cancer (2).

This is a really important point that I want to emphasize. You need to understand the potential mechanism before designing a clinical trial in which the treatment may actually harm people. For example, folate is an essential B vitamin because it is required for DNA replication and DNA repair among other things. Folate is required for the incorporation of a specific nucleotide, thymine into DNA. This is important because your body synthesizes new DNA as it makes new cells, meaning folate is required to make DNA for newly made cells. However, if you already have cancer, taking high doses of folic acid is not a good thing because cancer (among other things) is a disease of rapid and excessive cellular proliferation. This means that cancer cells require a continuous supply of nucleotides, amino acids, and energy to flourish. Since folate it necessary to make new DNA, cancer cells may use this to their advantage because they are continuously making new DNA. The results of the study are very specific to folate, and not something that should be generalized to other vitamins and minerals. The fact of the matter is that inhibition of folate metabolism is a well-established chemotherapeutic target for many types of cancer. This does not mean, however, that folate is bad... if you do not have cancer, having adequate levels of folate is very important to prevent cancer. In fact, inadequate folate levels actually damage your DNA - - which is itself known to cause cancer - - in a manner not unlike irradiation (3).

One other vitamin that has shown similar paradoxical effects is vitamin A. Vitamin A ultimately gets converted into a steroid hormone, retinoic acid, which regulates the transcription of many different genes. For example, Retinoic acid plays an important role in the function of the immune system, which is important to fight off cancer. 

With that said, it has been shown that individuals at high risk for lung cancer due to smoking cigarettes or asbestos exposure should avoid high doses of vitamin A because it can accelerate carcinogenesis (3). The same dose of vitamin A given to non-smokers does not affect cancer incidence. It has been shown that the lungs of smokers have a highly oxidative environment in addition to low levels of anti-oxidants such as vitamins C and E (3). Under these highly oxidative conditions caratenoids can be cleaved into products that can damage DNA (which is known to cause carcinogenesis) and these cleaved products also interfere with caratenoids forming active vitamin A hormone (3). 

As for the negative effects of high doses of particular vitamins, it is important to differentiate between the effects on someone in a healthy versus diseased state. In the case of folate, inadequate levels in a healthy person can cause cancer but for someone that already has cancer, high doses of folate is fuel to feed the cancer cells. In the case of vitamin A, people that are smokers or have been exposed to asbestos, need to be cautious about supplementing with high doses of vitamin A and this does not appear to be the case for non-smokers. Well, everyone should be cautious about high doses of vitamin A since it is fat-soluble it can be toxic at high levels to anyone. Too much of a good this can sometimes be a bad thing.

There are also multitude of well-done studies that have shown the protective effects of vitamin D on cancer incidence and metastasis. Theses studies have shown that people with adequate levels of vitamin D have a decreased cancer incidence and all-cause mortality. Additionally, the same has been shown for individuals that have already had cancer: adequate levels of vitamin D were associated with decreased metastasis and relapse.

I also want to point out that many micronutrients are important for immune function, which is a critical line of defense against cancer. You need your immune cells to be functioning at their best so having micronutrient inadequacies is one way to ensure that will not happen.

__Now let's take a look at the two studies that investigated the effect of V/M supplementation on cognitive function:__
The first study looked at the effects of vitamin D on cognition and while this study actually used adequate doses of vitamin D (5,000 IU/day), the serum levels of vitamin D after treatment were 39ng/ml compared to the placebo, which was 30ng/nl (2). Both the placebo and treatment groups were in the adequate range so it is difficult to make any conclusions about the effect of vitamin D on cognitive function. If you want to investigate the effects of vitamin D on cognitive function then I suggest comparing populations that have different serum levels of vitamin D. The second study looked at the effects of a multivitamin similar to centrum silver on cognitive function in men over 65 but did not measure any serum levels of V/M at baseline or after treatment (4). Therefore, with no biochemical analysis, no conclusions can be made. An additional drawback of this study was that cognitive function was assessed by a phone call instead of any substantive, quantitative metric.

__Let's look at the effects on cardiovascular disease:__
Two studies looked at the effect of long-term multivitamin supplementation on cardiovascular diseases. In both studies, no biochemical data on serum levels of vitamins or minerals were provided either at baseline or at the followup. Also, one study required taking 6 pills a day for 4.5 years and with no biochemical data, there is no real way to no if people were compliant (5). Therefore, the conclusions are questionable. Again to highlight the importance of biochemical data, one study demonstrated that vitamins C and E supplementation significantly reduced incidence of athleroslerotic lesions (2). They showed that plasma vitamin E levels increased by 90% and the vitamin C levels increased by 72% after supplementation (2). Why was this positive effect not mentioned in the editorial? Could it be that the positive effects will not grab the attention of the press?

__In summary:__
If you are going to take time to attempt to compile data collected from nutritional clinical trials, I suggest you understand how to critically analyze the data. Clinical trials in nutrition are extremely difficult to do right. It is imperative to measure vitamin/mineral concentrations in the plasma both BEFORE and AFTER treatment.

__ The failures of this editorial are the following:__
* Failures to critically analyze the data in the studies and over generalizing the results.
* Lumping all vitamins and minerals together when effects depend on dose and even individual disease status.
*Failure to quantitate any vitamin/mineral concentrations at baseline or follow-up.
The answer is not to end all research and stop supplementation of vitamins and minerals. 
Instead, the answer is quite the opposite. It is to do MORE research and establish what those very specific edge cases are and for healthcare providers to make recommendations based on knowledge of the positive and negative effects and not to make poorly-informed recommendations caused by lack of knowledge or from having read too many highly misleading editorials.

&lt;p>Background Vitamin D production during pregnancy promotes fetal lung development, a major determinant of infant survival after preterm birth.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of the present paper was to review the most important mechanisms explaining the possible association of vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular diseases, focusing on recent experimental and clinical data. Low vitamin D levels favor atherosclerosis enabling vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, formation of foam cells, and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. The antihypertensive properties of vitamin D include suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renoprotective effects, direct effects on endothelial cells and calcium metabolism, inhibition of growth of vascular smooth muscle cells, prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Vitamin D is also involved in glycemic control, lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and sensitivity, explaining the association between vitamin D deficiency and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin D deficit was associated in some studies with the number of affected coronary arteries, postinfarction complications, inflammatory cytokines and cardiac remodeling in patients with myocardial infarction, direct electromechanical effects and inflammation in atrial fibrillation, and neuroprotective effects in stroke. In peripheral arterial disease, vitamin D status was related to the decline of the functional performance, severity, atherosclerosis and inflammatory markers, arterial stiffness, vascular calcifications, and arterial aging. Vitamin D supplementation should further consider additional factors, such as phosphates, parathormone, renin, and fibroblast growth factor 23 levels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D measured in 4000 people for many years – longitudinal associations</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-measured-in-4000-people-for-many-years-longitudinal-associations.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-measured-in-4000-people-for-many-years-longitudinal-associations.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="longitudinal-associations-between-lifestyle-and-vitamin-d-a-general-population-study-with-repeated-vitamin-d-measurements">Longitudinal associations between lifestyle and vitamin D: A general population study with repeated vitamin D measurements.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D insufficiency, defined as low serum concentrations of the major circulating form of vitamin D, 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), has been associated with the development of numerous infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders in humans. In addition, vitamin D insufficiency has been found to be predictive of mortality for many disorders. However, interpretation of human studies is difficult since vitamin D status is influenced by many factors, including diet, season, latitude, and exposure to UV radiation. In contrast, domesticated cats do not produce vitamin D cutaneously, and most cats are fed a commercial diet containing a relatively standard amount of vitamin D. Consequently, domesticated cats are an attractive model system in which to examine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and health outcomes. The hypothesis of this study was that vitamin D status would predict short term, all-cause mortality in domesticated cats. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, together with a wide range of other clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters, were measured in 99 consecutively hospitalised cats. Cats which died within 30 days of initial assessment had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations than cats which survived. In a linear regression model including 12 clinical variables, serum 25(OH)D concentration in the lower tertile was significantly predictive of mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stroke when less than 75 years old and with low vitamin D – 3X more likely to die in 1 year</title><link>/posts/stroke-when-less-than-75-years-old-and-with-low-vitamin-d-3x-more-likely-to-die-in-1-year.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/stroke-when-less-than-75-years-old-and-with-low-vitamin-d-3x-more-likely-to-die-in-1-year.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="association-between-serum-concentration-of-vitamin-d-and-1-year-mortality-in-stroke-patients">Association between serum concentration of vitamin D and 1-year mortality in stroke patients.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>A tremendous amount of data from research was published over the past decades concerning the roles of different vitamins in various gastrointestinal diseases. For instance, most vitamins showed an inverse relationship with the risk of colorectal carcinoma as well as other malignancies like gastric and esophageal cancer in observational trials, however interventional trials failed to prove a clear beneficial preventive role. On the other hand, more solid evidence was obtained from high quality studies for a role of certain vitamins in specific entities.

&lt;p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and vitamin D deficiency are extremely prevalent worldwide (Holick 2007; World Health Organization 2011). The potential link between vitamin D deficiency and CVD-related death in both healthy and diseased populations is a growing area of translational research. Historically, the traditional role of vitamin D in maintaining calcium homeostasis and mineral metabolism has been extensively studied (Lieben and Carmeliet 2013). Vitamin D, via its classical genomic transcriptional activity, is known to affect the physiological function of a number of target organs such as the heart, bone, and kidneys (Lieben et al. 2011). Furthermore, as highlighted in a paper published recently in Physiological Resports (Foong et al. 2014), there appears to be a link between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory symptoms in chronic lung disease. In addition, a number of nongenomic, rapid action roles of vitamin D are now known to affect tissue function, which fall outside the traditional role of regulating mineral metabolism (Gniadecki 1998; Brown et al. 1999; Norman et al. 2002; Haussler et al. 2011). While calcium and phosphate have long been regarded as the major players in the interactions observed between mineral metabolism dysfunction and CVD- related deaths, (Peacock 2010; Bolland et al. 2011; Brini et al. 2013), these newer nongenomic roles outside of the traditional target organs suggest that vitamin D itself may have intrinsic actions outside the realm of mineral metabolism (Gniadecki 1998; Brown et al. 1999; Norman et al. 2002; Haussler et al. 2011).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pneumonia acquired in hospital – 3X more likely to die if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/pneumonia-acquired-in-hospital-3x-more-likely-to-die-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pneumonia-acquired-in-hospital-3x-more-likely-to-die-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia and it increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Still there is not a complete understanding of its etiology and underlying pathways. Vitamin D might regulate renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and might be involved in inflammation, both implicated in the pathophysiology of AF. The objective of this work was to investigate the association between vitamin D status with the risk of AF in the elderly. This study was conducted within the Rotterdam Study, a community-based cohort of middle-aged and elderly participants in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. We had 3,395 participants who were free of AF diagnosis at the start of our study and who had vitamin D data available. We analyzed the association between serum 25-hydroxivitamin D (25(OH)D) and incidence of AF using Cox regression models. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D concentrations &amp;lt;50nmol/l, insufficiency between 50nmol/l and 75nmol/l, while serum 25(OH)D concentrations equal to and above 75nmol/l were considered as adequate. After mean follow-up of 12.0 years 263 (7.7%) participants were diagnosed with incident AF. Vitamin D status was not associated with AF in any of the 3 multivariate models tested (model adjusted for socio-demographic factors and life-style factors: HR per 10 unit increment in serum 25(OH)D 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-1.02; HR for insufficiency: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.60-1.11,and HR for adequate status: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.52-1.12 compared to deficiency). This prospective cohort study does not support the hypothesis that vitamin D status is associated with AF.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and fertility – Lerchbaum 2012, 2014</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-fertility-lerchbaum-2012-2014.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-fertility-lerchbaum-2012-2014.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The 2012 study was referenced by the book &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Mommy-Me-Vitamin-Eugene-Heyden/dp/0982827636/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1430676754&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=mommy%2Cme+and+vitamin+d">Mommy, Me &amp;amp; Vitamin D&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Heyden 2014&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Objective: To determine the incidence trend of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) values above 50 ng/mL and associated toxicity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, in the 10-year period from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2011, by using the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Individuals were eligible if they resided in Olmsted County during the study period and had a measured 25(OH)D value above 50 ng/mL. The date of the first 25(OH)D value above 50 ng/mL was considered the index date for incidence determination. Hypercalcemia, the primary vitamin D toxicity, was considered potentially associated with the 25(OH)D concentration if it was measured within 3 months of the 25(OH)D measurement, and such cases had a medical record review.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and Inflammatory Bowel Disease – review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-inflammatory-bowel-disease-review.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-inflammatory-bowel-disease-review.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Several studies on this page&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dear Editor,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gait speed is a quick, inexpensive and reliable measure of functional capacity in the elderly, and, when reduced, predicts health-related outcomes such as poor quality of life, physical and cognitive functional decline, falls, nursing home admissions, hospitalizations, and mortality &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. In this context, we wish to focus on the article by D’Aliesio et al. &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup> which reported a relationship between gait speed and mental health in community dwelling, physically active elderly subjects. Conclusively, the authors indicated gait speed as an indicator of mental functions, which, however, might not be a common sense among the readers of the journal. Because, gait speed is easily affected by secondary causes in the elderly, including vitamin D deficiency &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup> that was reported as a specifically common condition in Italy where the study by D’Aliesio et al. was conducted and linked to various causes including skin pigmentation and sun-protection behaviors &lt;sup>[4]&lt;/sup>. Sun avoid behaviors are also more common among depressive subjects who are likely to have lower mental scores than healthy individuals &lt;sup>[5]&lt;/sup>. As the study by D’Aliesio et al. did not report any data regarding vitamin D levels of their participants, it is unclear whether such a confounder has influenced the study outcomes. Because hypovitaminosis D was hypothesized to be associated with worse outcome on cognitive functions &lt;sup>[6]&lt;/sup>, the central cause of suboptimal mental functions in the study by D’Aliesio et al. might be low vitamin D levels leading to both gait impairment and cognitive failure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prostate Cancer – 300,000 annual deaths, low vitamin D is one of many factors – current status</title><link>/posts/prostate-cancer-300000-annual-deaths-low-vitamin-d-is-one-of-many-factors-current-status.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/prostate-cancer-300000-annual-deaths-low-vitamin-d-is-one-of-many-factors-current-status.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="epidemiology-of-prostate-cancer-current-status">Epidemiology of prostate cancer: current status.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men with &amp;gt; 1,100,000 new cases and 300,000 deaths worldwide each year. The disease is more common among older men, with a median age at diagnosis around age above 60 years. Prostate cancer is a major medical problem that needs immediate attention as the disease is indolent, shows prolonged latency in association with high morbidity and mortality. Administration of diagnostic tests including PSA test and biopsies and the advances in other diagnostic procedures have led to early detection of the disease with therapeutic steps being taken early on, there has been a steady decline in the disease-specific mortality. Global incidence and mortality rates show that the disease is &lt;strong>more prevalent among black people,&lt;/strong> even though the differences cannot be attributed entirely to race, as the influence of socioeconomic situation and the resultant limited access to medical technologies and treatment could not be ruled out completely. Several genes have been identified that when mutated confer high risk for the disease. Besides the genetic factors, family history and nutritional factors such as lack of enough vitamin D, high intake of calcium, &lt;strong>obesity&lt;/strong> and high fat diets have been implicated as risk factors for prostate cancer. Therapeutic measures for prostate cancer involve mostly radical prostatectomy followed by radiotherapy in combination with hormonal treatment as needed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pregnant women will get Vitamin D – going beyond clinical trials</title><link>/posts/pregnant-women-will-get-vitamin-d-going-beyond-clinical-trials.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pregnant-women-will-get-vitamin-d-going-beyond-clinical-trials.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="update-2015-ensure-a-healthy-pregnancy-and-infant-with-as-little-as-20-of-vitamin-dpostsensure-a-healthy-pregnancy-and-infant-with-as-little-as-20-of-vitamin-d-anywhere-around-the-world">Update 2015 &lt;a href="/posts/ensure-a-healthy-pregnancy-and-infant-with-as-little-as-20-of-vitamin-d">Ensure a healthy pregnancy and infant with as little as $20 of Vitamin D&lt;/a> anywhere around the world&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disturbed innate immune processes characterize the pathogenesis of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in COPD patients and has been associated with disease severity. Interestingly, a number of mechanistic evidence from animal and in vitro studies has demonstrated important innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and antimicrobial functions. In this review, we will discuss in detail how these innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D could provide therapeutic potential in COPD patients. Finally, the remaining challenges associated with vitamin D therapy in COPD patients will be discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1 in 6 critically ill in India have high levels of vitamin D (100 ng)</title><link>/posts/1-in-6-critically-ill-in-india-have-high-levels-of-vitamin-d-100-ng.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/1-in-6-critically-ill-in-india-have-high-levels-of-vitamin-d-100-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="supraphysiological-25-hydroxy-vitamin-d3-level-at-admission-is-associated-with-illness-severity-and-mortality-in-critically-ill-patients">Supraphysiological 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 level at admission is associated with illness severity and mortality in critically ill patients&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for cancer, however it remains uncertain whether vitamin D deficiency also predisposes to death from cancer. The aim of the study was to determine the association between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25 (OH) D) concentrations and cancer-specific mortality in a community-based cohort of older post-menopausal women.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overview Sickle Cell and Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/overview-sickle-cell-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/overview-sickle-cell-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#00F;">Several Sickle Cell trials have found that a loading dose of vitamin D followed by a good sized maintenance dose greatly reduces the number of days of SC pain&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The size of the loading and maintence doses should vary by weight and health.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>One study used a loading dose 100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks - ignoring weight&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have markedly higher rates of severe vitamin D deficiency and reduced ability to convert 25-(OH)vitamin D into the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. In the setting of CKD, secondary hyperparathyroidism develops as a consequence of reduced renal production of active vitamin D and phosphate retention resulting in hypocalcaemia and hyperpho- sphataemia. This is a process that is dangerously linked with metabolic bone disease, arterial calcifications and cardiovascular mortality &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>. Therefore, the conventional rationale for vitamin D treatment in CKD is to slow the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypothesis: Vitamin K will reduce prostate blood vessel problems</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-vitamin-k-will-reduce-prostate-blood-vessel-problems.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-vitamin-k-will-reduce-prostate-blood-vessel-problems.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-k-the-missing-link-to-prostate-health">Vitamin K: The missing link to prostate health&lt;/h4>

In seven Austrian PD units clinical and laboratory data on each peritonitis episode were collected from all patients (n = 726) who performed PD between January 2000 and December 2009. The peritonitis incidence rate was 0.32 episodes/patient-year. In a multivariate analysis the risk of peritonitis was decreased by 57% in patients treated with oral active vitamin D (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.28–0.64). Renal disease classified as “other or unknown” (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.08–2.53) and serum albumin &amp;lt;3500 mg/dl (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.04–2.15) were also associated with an increased risk of peritonitis. Albumin levels &amp;lt;3500 mg/dl (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.13–3.17), age (HR 1.06 per year; 95% CI 1.03–1.09), and cardiomyopathy (HR 3.01; 95% CI 1.62–5.59) were associated with increased mortality, whereas treatment with oral active vitamin D was associated with a significantly lower risk of death (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27–0.81). In this retrospective multi-center study we identified several factors being related to increased risk of peritonitis in PD patients. Treatment with oral active vitamin D was identified as being independently associated with decreased risk of peritonitis, and decreased all-cause mortality in PD patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Light (especially UV) and Health conference – Germany</title><link>/posts/light-especially-uv-and-health-conference-germany.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/light-especially-uv-and-health-conference-germany.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;">&lt;/i>&lt;a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/51-invitation-biologic-effects-of-light-june-2015-homburg.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki.&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A large number of human, animal and in vitro studies have suggested that vitamin D3 (VD3) plays a critical role in inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and allergic rhinitis. VD3 acts upon a broad range of immune cells involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases including T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B-cells. In addition, VD3 can also regulate the functions of a number of non-immune cells including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. Given that VD3 has known effects on the immune system, it seems logical that supplementation with VD3 would prove efficacious in the treatment of these three diseases. While many studies, most of which are observational, have suggested that VD3 deficiency is associated with more severe disease, VD3 supplementation trials in humans have resulted in varied outcomes in terms of efficacy. In this review article we will discuss the role of VD3 in these three commonly associated respiratory diseases. We will explore the literature describing associations of VD3 deficiency with patient outcomes, cells in the respiratory microenvironment susceptible to VD3 regulation, conflicting results of VD3 supplementation trials, and potential gaps in our knowledge that may be limiting the widespread use of VD3 for the treatment of respiratory diseases such asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis.

&lt;p>Vitamin D is a compound responsible for maintaining mineral homeostasis. It protects against calcium and phosphate deficiency through the effects on the intestine, kidney, parathyroid gland and bone. All mechanisms that help maintain mineral homeostasis of the body are regulated by the vitamin D hormonal form - calcitriol. Synthesis of vitamin D starts in the skin as a non-enzymatic process, which begins during exposure to sunlight, when the absorption of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation results in convertion of 7-dehydrocholesterol, a metabolite of cholesterol that is stored in the skin, to precholecalciferol (previtamin-D₃) that is immediately converted into cholecalciferol (vitamin D₃). After the skin synthesis cholecalciferol is transported to the liver where it undergoes hydroxylation, what results in formation of calcidiol (25(OH)D₃). The second metabolic process takes place in the kidney, where calcidiol undergoes hydroxylation at the C-1 position to the hormonal, the most active metabolite - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Transdermal Magnesium Chloride spray - variable responses, removed toxic metals - 2010</title><link>/posts/transdermal-magnesium-chloride-spray-variable-responses-removed-toxic-metals-2010.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/transdermal-magnesium-chloride-spray-variable-responses-removed-toxic-metals-2010.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Research into the extra-skeletal functions of vitamin D has been expanding in recent years. During pregnancy, maternal vitamin D status may be of concern because of the key role of this vitamin in fetal skeletal development and due to the association between hypovitaminosis D and adverse maternal–fetal outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this manuscript was to review the maternal–fetal impact of gestational vitamin D deficiency and the benefits of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy. A literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase employing the following keywords: vitamin D deficiency, pregnancy, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and hypovitaminosis D. All relevant articles in English language published since 1980 were analysed by the two authors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D, immunity and microbiome</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-immunity-and-microbiome.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-immunity-and-microbiome.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vitamin D and immunity&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of a wide range of adverse health outcomes. The active form of vitamin D has an important role in calcium metabolism and in bone mineralisation, but the evidence for other health outcomes is mixed, with the strongest effects seen in the weakest epidemiological study designs. There are plausible pathways whereby vitamin D deficiency can impair immune function, resulting in both overactivity and increased risk of autoimmune disease, as well as immune suppression with poorer resistance to infection. Vitamin D status may influence the bacterial flora that constitute the microbiome and affect immune function through this route. Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation causes the production of a range of chemicals, including vitamin D, and new research is exploring possible vitamin D-independent immunomodulatory pathways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One autoimmune disease lowers vitamin D, a second AI disease does not lower it further</title><link>/posts/one-autoimmune-disease-lowers-vitamin-d-a-second-ai-disease-does-not-lower-it-further.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/one-autoimmune-disease-lowers-vitamin-d-a-second-ai-disease-does-not-lower-it-further.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-autoimmunity-what-happens-in-autoimmune-polyendocrine-syndromes">Vitamin D and autoimmunity: what happens in autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>A brief survey of recent literature was conducted with regard to vitamin D and pain. There is evidence for and against a role for vitamin D in the treatment of chronic pain. The contradictory findings may have to do with study design or perhaps the type and intensity of pain. To answer the question whether there is a role for vitamin D in the treatment of chronic pain, larger and longer duration studies need to be conducted. The design should also be such to assess whether vitamin D might act to increase the effectiveness of existing analgesics and/or reduce the dose and duration of their use, thereby increasing safety.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meningitis and other brain infections should be prevented by Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/meningitis-and-other-brain-infections-should-be-prevented-by-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/meningitis-and-other-brain-infections-should-be-prevented-by-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major public health problem whose prevalence has been increasing in recent years. It is characterized by a progressive pattern and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Several factors are associated with the onset and progression of DN, such as glycaemic control, hypertension, obesity and inflammation status. In addition, vitamin D also seems to be involved through a pleiotropic regulatory activity/protection with promising applicability, either in prevention or progression of renal disease. The purpose of this review was to summarize the scientific evidence that supports the role of vitamin D in diabetes mellitus and DN.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1.5X increased infection, sepsis, and death if in ICU with low vitamin D - Meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/15x-increased-infection-sepsis-and-death-if-in-icu-with-low-vitamin-d-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/15x-increased-infection-sepsis-and-death-if-in-icu-with-low-vitamin-d-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-as-a-risk-factor-for-infection-sepsis-and-mortality-in-the-critically-ill-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis">Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for infection, sepsis and mortality in the critically ill: systematic review and meta-analysis.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D, a calciotropic hormone, is gaining attention for many aspects of health, particularly metabolic regulation. As societal trends towards increasing caloric intake become more prominent, the concern for diseases stemming from chronic inflammation grows.

&lt;p>In the early 1920s the antirachitic effect of food irradiated with ultraviolet light and cod liver oil has been recognized. The antirachitic substance was identified and called &amp;ldquo;vitamin D&amp;rdquo;. Since then the key role of vitamin D in calcium and bone homeostasis has been investigated. Moreover, it has been recognized that vitamin D is able to modulate a variety of processes and regulatory systems such as host defense, inflammation, immunity, and repair. According to recent studies, vitamin D deficiency is likely to be an important etiological factor in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, as well as it has been associated with higher mortality rate for respiratory disease. In this regard, either observational studies aimed to verify an association between low vitamin D level and the incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) or clinical trials on the effect of vitamin D as a supplementary treatment in RTIs patients have been presented in the emerging clinical literature. Conflicting results have been demonstrated in several randomized, doubleblind, placebo controlled trials concerning the vitamin D treatment in tuberculosis. Some studies suggest a beneficial effect by vitamin D but it could not be reproduced in larger studies so far. In conclusion, although basic science research suggests that vitamin D may play an important role in modulating immune functions, no strong evidence exists whether correction of vitamin D depletion may be useful in the prevention or treatment of infections. Further and larger studies may clarify the role of vitamin D in infection.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autoimmune Hepatitis 8X more likely if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/autoimmune-hepatitis-8x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autoimmune-hepatitis-8x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Introduction&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The sunshine vitamin has been associated with reduced risk for many chronic illnesses including cancer and cancer mortality. Epidemiologic and ecological studies have suggested that living at higher latitudes and having lower blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with increased risk for up to 15 cancers including breast, colon, lung, lymphoma, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer. Most randomized controlled trials using appropriate doses of vitamin D have suggested that improvement in vitamin D status reduces risk for several cancers. Although the exact mechanism by which enhanced vitamin D status reduces risk for cancer is not completely understood, there is evidence that by raising blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D this metabolite can enter a wide variety of cells in the body and then be converted to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3. The vitamin D metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has been demonstrated to markedly reduce cellular proliferation especially of malignant cells that have a vitamin D receptor. It also induces terminal differentiation. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is also anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic which also plays a role in reducing the growth and spread of malignant cells. Thus improvement in vitamin D status with sensible sun exposure, vitamin D supplementation and ingesting foods containing vitamin D is a reasonable strategy to reduce risk of malignancy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Antimicrobial peptides (which attack pathogens) are increased by Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/antimicrobial-peptides-which-attack-pathogens-are-increased-by-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/antimicrobial-peptides-which-attack-pathogens-are-increased-by-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>Experiencing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may lead to chronic post- concussive symptoms, increasing the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with cognitive decline, depression, and potentially PTSD through its relationship to testosterone production. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency elevates systematic inflammation, meaning that poor vitamin D status at the time of blast may prolong inflammatory response to mTBI and exacerbate post-concussive symptoms. Since widespread vitamin D deficiency is observed across the U.S. population, poor vitamin D status is expected in service members. Given the high risk for mTBI in service members and suboptimal vitamin D levels observed in this population, treatment of vitamin D deficiency and elucidation of its mechanism in mTBI resilience and recovery merits exploration. Evidence in this review investigates possible protection of achieving optimal vitamin D levels for mTBI resiliency and recovery through its influence on inflammatory and hormonal biomarkers. Despite interest in using vitamin D as treatment for TBI, no human trials have tested the role of vitamin D in mTBI resiliency or recovery, nor have data been prospectively collected on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in service members. The neuroprotective effects of vitamin D warrant further investigation into the role of vitamin D in mTBI management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels in Europe</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-in-europe.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-in-europe.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vitamin D: An overview of vitamin D status and intake in Europe&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In recent years, there have been reports suggesting a high prevalence of low vitamin D intakes and vitamin D deficiency or inadequate vitamin D status in Europe. Coupled with growing concern about the health risks associated with low vitamin D status, this has resulted in increased interest in the topic of vitamin D from healthcare professionals, the media and the public. Adequate vitamin D status has a key role in skeletal health. Prevention of the well-described vitamin D deficiency disorders of rickets and osteomalacia are clearly important, but there may also be an implication of low vitamin D status in bone loss, muscle weakness and falls and fragility fractures in older people, and these are highly significant public health issues in terms of morbidity, quality of life and costs to health services in Europe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Critically ill patients with low vitamin D were 13X more likely to have a lot of mitrocondrial DNA in blood</title><link>/posts/critically-ill-patients-with-low-vitamin-d-were-13x-more-likely-to-have-a-lot-of-al-dna-in-blood.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/critically-ill-patients-with-low-vitamin-d-were-13x-more-likely-to-have-a-lot-of-al-dna-in-blood.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="circulating-mitochondrial-dna-and-vitamin-d-in-critical-illness">Circulating mitochondrial dna and vitamin d in critical illness&lt;/h3>

Introduction
Inflammation is believed to be a contributing factor to many chronic diseases. The influence of vitamin D deficiency on inflammation is being explored but studies have not demonstrated a causative effect.
Methods
Low serum 25(OH)D is also found in healthy persons exposed to adequate sunlight. Despite increased vitamin D supplementation inflammatory diseases are increasing. The current method of determining vitamin D status may be at fault. The level of 25(OH)D does not always reflect the level of 1,25(OH)2D. Assessment of both metabolites often reveals elevated 1,25(OH)2D, indicating abnormal vitamin D endocrine function.
Findings
This article reviews vitamin D's influence on the immune system, examines the myths regarding vitamin D photosynthesis, discusses ways to accurately assess vitamin D status, describes the risks of supplementation, explains the effect of persistent infection on vitamin D metabolism and presents a novel immunotherapy which provides evidence of an infection connection to inflammation.
Conclusion
Some authorities now believe that low 25(OH)D is a consequence of chronic inflammation rather than the cause. Research points to a bacterial etiology pathogenesis for an inflammatory disease process which results in high 1,25(OH)2D and low 25(OH)D. Immunotherapy, directed at eradicating persistent intracellular pathogens, corrects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and resolves inflammatory symptoms.

!!!!Introduction
Inflammation is involved in many chronic diseases and concern has been raised about the influence of vitamin D deficiency on inflammatory processes. When studies found an association between inflammatory diseases and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), further research found evidence of low vitamin D in a large segment of the general population. This led some authorities to declare a world-wide epidemic of vitamin D deficiency and to recommend vitamin D supplementation. Experts are debating the definition of vitamin D deficiency and the appropriate vitamin D doses, while further research is being done to determine if vitamin D supplementation has the intended effect.
According to some current definitions of vitamin D deficiency, even healthy persons, exposed to adequate sunlight, are unable to acquire enough vitamin D without supplementation. Often reiterated causes of vitamin D deficiency can be disputed in the light of more current research. In the absence of definitive studies, authorities are questioning the wisdom of supplementing the general population with vitamin D. The definition of Vitamin D deficiency needs re-evaluation in view of the fact that low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy and sick individuals. Concerns about vitamin D deficiency merit a closer look at the current method of determining vitamin D status because the level of 25(OH)D does not always reflect the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25(OH)2D). Analysis of this active metabolite may reveal elevated 1,25(OH)2D) in the presence of low 25(OH)D and lead to a diagnosis of abnormal vitamin D endocrine system function.
An infectious pathogenesis posits that intracellular bacteria disrupt the vitamin D regulated immune system, resulting in persistent infection and chronic inflammation.
In the clinical setting, a novel immunotherapy is demonstrating the ability to resolve vitamin D metabolism dysfunction, restore immune function, and thus, eliminate infection and reduce inflammation. This review ponders the question, ‘‘Is low 25(OH)D a cause of, or a consequence of inflammation?” The answer is found in the evidence that adds persistent intracellular infection to the equation.
!!!!Vitamin D metabolism
The sequential metabolic processes that convert biologically inactive, parental vitamin D into active metabolites begin when vitamin D3 is photosynthesized in the skin or when vitamin D2 or D3 is ingested. Vitamin D is transported to the liver where it is hydroxylated by an enzyme (CYP2R1, also known as cytochrome P450 2R1) to produce 25(OH)D [1]. 25(OH)D is then transported to the kidneys where it is hydroxylated by another enzyme (CYP27B1, formerly 1a-hydroxylase) to produce 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D (also known as calcitriol), the active metabolite, is the most potent steroid hormone in the human body [2]. Feedback mechanisms regulate production of 1,25(OH)2D in the kidneys via serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast-like growth factor- 23 (FGF23) calcium, and phosphate [3]. 1,25(OH)2D is also produced in many other tissues (e.g., skin, macrophages, colon, pancreas, blood vessels, etc.) by enzymatic actions [4]. The vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) transports 1,25(OH)2D to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the cell nucleus [5]. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factors. 1,25(OH)2D binds to the VDR and mediates the transcription of DNA, triggered by signaling proteins, like nuclear factor kappa-B (NFk-B) [6] (Fig. 1).
The influence of 1,25(OH)2D on the immune system is one of its most important roles. 1,25(OH)2D regulates the immune system via the VDR which is present in most immune cell types, particularly in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells [7]. 1,25(OH)2D activates the VDR to express antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as cathelicidin and beta defensins which attack pathogens [8, 9]. In general, the innate immune system is enhanced and the adaptive immune system is inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D [10, 11]. Thus, an effective immune response is heavily dependent on the vitamin D endocrine system which performs a balancing act of inflammation versus anti-inflammation.
!!!!Vitamin D deficiency
Concerns about vitamin D deficiency arose when studies showed patients with autoimmune diseases have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D and study subjects given vitamin D had lower rates of autoimmune diseases and fewer markers of inflammation [12, 13]. However, authorities have not agreed on the significance of low 25(OH)D and without a consistent normal range for serum 25(OH)D, the definitions of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency from the Vitamin D Council, the Endocrine Society and the Institute of Medicine vary significantly.
__The Vitamin D Council definition [14]:__
Deficient: 0-40 ng/ml
Sufficient: 40-80 ng/ml
High normal: 80-100 ng/ml
__The Endocrine Society definition [15]:__
Deficiency &lt; 20 ng/ml
Insufficiency = 20-29 ng/ml
__The Institute of Medicine definition [16]:__
Risk/deficiency &lt;12 ng/ml
Risk/insufficiency = 12-20 ng/ml
Sufficient = 20 ng/ml
In 2006, the Merck Manual listed 25-40 ng/ml as the normal 25(OH)D range [17]. Recently, this range has skyrocketed to 30-74 ng/ml [18]. Quest Diagnostics now lists the upper limit of normal 25(OH)D as 100 ng/ml [19]. Laboratory reference ranges for serum 25(OH)D levels have long been based upon average values from populations of healthy individuals but many people are now supplementing with vitamin D. In the US, the leading authority regarding medical research is the prestigious Institute of Medicine (IOM). The 2010 IOM report on vitamin D emphasized that the current measurements, or cut-off points, of sufficiency and deficiency of 25(OH) D in use by laboratories have not been set using rigorous scientific studies. It suggests that since no central authority has determined which cut-off points to use, reports of deficiency and lab ranges may be skewed and numbers overestimated [16]. Therefore, it would be prudent to use the IOM vitamin D deficiency guideline in the clinical setting, for clinical studies and when evaluating research results.
!!!!Purported reasons for vitamin D deficiency
Is low 25(OH)D among the general population an accurate assessment of vitamin D deficiency? Many reasons are cited for the current ‘epidemic’ of vitamin D ‘deficiency’ but closer examination reveals these beliefs are based on outdated or limited studies and can be challenged with more recent research.
Melanin pigmentation is only one factor that determines the amount of vitamin D3 which is photosynthesized [20, 21]. Bogh et al. [22] measured the baseline serum 25(OH)D and total cholesterol levels of 182 fair-skinned and dark-skinned subjects; and studied the effect of UV radiation on their serum 25(OH)D levels. They found the amount of serum 25(OH)D produced was determined by the amount of cholesterol in the skin, not on skin pigmentation. Matsuoka et al. [23] investigated the effect of racial pigmentation on vitamin D3 formation, simulating the process with a fixed dose of UVB radiation and concluded that while racial pigmentation has a photoprotective effect, it does not prevent the generation of normal levels of active vitamin D metabolites. Persons with dark skin also compensate for low 25(OH)D by rapidly converting it to the active 1,25(OH)2D metabolite, thus allowing them to maintain adequate vitamin D status [24]. Skin pigmentation does not appear to negatively affect vitamin D status [25].
Clothing is a barrier to vitamin D photosynthesis but this is an issue only for people who cover themselves from head to toe [26]. It takes relatively little sunlight exposure to acquire adequate stores of vitamin D and few people wear enough clothes to prevent that from happening. Ten to 15 min of sunlight or daylight exposure to a small area of skin (e.g., the forearm or face, etc.) twice a week, without sunscreen, supplies all the vitamin D necessary for health [27]. The belief that sunscreen lotion blocks vitamin D production is based on a 1987 study done by Matsuoka et al. [28] that was funded by the ultraviolet foundation, which is supported by the tanning bed industry. Contradictory information was provided by Diehl and Chiu [29] which concluded that although sunscreens are effective, many may not actually be blocking UV-B because they are improperly or inadequately applied [30]. Thus, sunscreen use may not actually diminish vitamin D synthesis in real world use. However, prolonged unprotected sun exposure should be avoided to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.
Although pollution can block some ultraviolet radiation, even in urban areas of high pollution 50 % of UV rays reach the ground [31]. A significant amount of UV radiation exposure can be obtained in dense metropolitan areas; tall buildings provide shade but shade gives up to 50 % of UV rays. Indoor workers receive 10-20 % of outdoor workers’ yearly UV exposure [31]; and for many, this may be adequate, especially if sunlight exposure is higher when they are not working. UV radiation is reflected or scattered to varying extents by different surfaces. The scattering and absorption of light by clouds may not significantly reduce natural light exposure because over 90 % of UV rays may penetrate clouds [31]. Environmental factors are rarely an impediment to photosynthesis of adequate vitamin D.
As the skin ages, there is a decline in the cutaneous levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, resulting in a marked reduction of the skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 [32].
However, despite the up to fourfold reduction in vitamin D3 production in a 70-year-old compared to a 20-year-old, the skin has such a high capacity to make vitamin D3 that elders exposed to sunlight will produce an adequate amount of vitamin D3 to satisfy their vitamin D requirement [33, 34].
A 1988 study by Webb et al. [35] is often cited to support the conviction that latitude dramatically influences the amount of solar radiation available to synthesize vitamin D3. However, other researchers who conducted more recent studies refute this hypothesis. Kimlin et al. [36] report, ‘‘It may no longer be correct to assume that vitamin D levels in populations follow latitude gradients’’. And Lubin [37] states, ‘‘Geophysical surveys have shown that UV-B penetration over 24 h, during the summer months at Canadian north latitudes when there are many hours of sunlight, equals or exceeds UV-B penetration at the equator.’’ Ross et al. [16] report that ample opportunities exist to form vitamin D (and store it in the liver and fat for later use) from exposure to sunlight during the spring, summer, and fall months even in the far north latitudes.
Acceptance of these vitamin D myths regarding photosynthesis prevents consideration of the alternate hypothesis—low serum 25(OH)D, despite adequate photosynthesis of vitamin D3, is a result of an inflammatory process.
!!!!Low vitamin D is found in healthy subjects
Many studies of healthy subjects have found levels of 25(OH)D that, by some vitamin D definitions, are declared deficient (hypovitaminosis-D) [38, 39]. Vitamin D levels that are considered deficient have even been found in persons who are exposed to abundant sunlight [40]. Binkley et al. [41] showed a mean 25(OH)D level of 31.6 ng/ml among healthy young adult Hawaiian surfers. It is clear that low levels of 25(OH)D are found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. Opposing reasoning can be used to explain this contradiction. One explanation reasons that healthy persons with low 25(OH)D will become sick and sick people will develop lower 25(OH)D levels (Fig. 2); however, studies do not support this hypothesis. The correct explanation may be that, in the absence of disease, low 25(OH)D is normal.
!!!!Low vitamin D in the presence of diseases
Since low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, assessing vitamin D status with the measurement of an additional clinical marker may be helpful. It is asserted that D status with measurement of 1,25(OH)2D may be helpful low levels of 25(OH)D accurately reflect vitamin D status; however, measurement of 1,25(OH)2D often demonstrates a positive correlation of elevated 1,25(OH)2D to inflammatory diseases (Fig. 2). This is illustrated by Blaney et al.

Fig. 2 Interpretation of vitamin D deficiency via calcitriol measurement. Since low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, assessing vitamin D status with measurement of 1,25(OH)2D may be helpful

in a study of 100 patients with autoimmune and chronic disease which found that 85 % of subjects had levels of 1,25(OH)2D higher than 46.2 pg/ml without hypercalcemia. Although this serum level may be considered normal by some, lab ranges for 1,25(OH)2D may have been skewed high by the presence of patients with unrecognized persistent intracellular infection and thus, dysregulated vitamin D metabolism. The Danish 1,25(OH)2D population data (from a large and reliable study) found the mean value for 1,25(OH)2D in a normal population was 29 pg/ml with a standard deviation of 9.5
. More frequent measurement of both D-metabolites in the clinical and research settings, may shed light on the true meaning of low 25(OH)D.
Rickets is often cited as proof of the need for vitamin D supplementation. However, a review of the metabolic processes involved provides some prospective. Adequate vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, but adequate calcium is equally important; if either calcium or vitamin D is deficient, bone health suffers. Hypophosphatemia is the common denominator of all rickets; low calcium intake leads to hyperparathyroidism, which leads to high phosphorus excretion and, thus, phosphorus deficiency [44]. Rickets is rare in the developed world; however, children in developing countries, who usually photosynthesize enough vitamin D from sunlight, develop rickets if poverty prevents them from eating enough calcium-rich food [45, 46]. Studies have found that rickets occurs in sunny countries due to poor calcium intake and is cured with increased calcium ingestion [47, 48].
Osteoporosis is another disease which is closely linked with vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D is an important factor in maintaining bone health to avoid osteoporosis but a study by Reid et al. [49] published in The Lancet found little evidence supporting the use of vitamin D supplements by seniors hoping to improve bone density and ward off potential fractures. 1,25(OH)2D maintains calcium homeostasis between blood, cells and bones by stimulating calcium absorption from the intestines, reabsorption in the kidneys, and resorption in bones [50]. 1,25(OH)2D up- regulates the VDR in the small intestine, which then transcribes genes that shuttle calcium and phosphorus through the intestinal epithelium. However, mucosal response and calcium/phosphorus absorption are dependent on a competent VDR and elevated 1,25(OH)2D reduces VDR competence [51]. Thus, calcium and phosphorus absorption may be inhibited if VDR function is impaired by elevated 1,25(OH)2D. This is illustrated by Abreu et al. [52] in a study of Crohn’s patients with elevated 1,25(OH)2D and low bone mineral density which concluded that treatment of the underlying inflammation would improve metabolic bone disease. In fact, there is ample evidence that elevated 1,25(OH)2D leads to bone loss. Brot et al. [53] found that elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D were strongly associated with decreased bone mineral density and content, and increased bone turnover. When levels are above 42 pg/ml 1,25(OH)2D stimulates bone osteoclasts. This leads to osteoporosis, dental fractures and calcium deposition into the soft tissues [54]. Vanderschueren et al. [55] found that a combination of high 1,25(OH)2D and low 25(OH)D is associated with the poorest bone health.
!!!!Vitamin D supplementation
It is reasoned that if low 25(OH)D indicates a current or potential disease state, then increasing 25(OH)D by supplementing with vitamin D should provide some symptom relief and/or protection. So far, there is scant evidence for this hypothesis [56, 57]. According to Ross et al. [16] in the 2010 IOM report, ‘‘Outcomes related to autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, falls and physical performance, immune functioning, infections, neuropsychological functioning, and preeclampsia could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake and were often conflicting.’’ Despite the recent increase in vitamin D supplementation, chronic diseases have increased and are expected to continue increasing [58, 59].
Consequently, more vitamin D experts are beginning to reconsider vitamin D supplementation among the general population [60]. Recommending higher vitamin D intake to large populations carries the potential risk of overdosing certain individuals [61]. It is difficult to ingest too much vitamin D from food, and natural mechanisms regulate the amount of vitamin D3 photosynthesized from sunlight [62].
However, elevated 25(OH)D and hypervitaminosis-D can occur due to vitamin D supplementation [63]. A study by Noordam et al. [65] cast doubt on the causal nature of previously reported associations between low levels of vitamin D and age-related diseases and mortality. A comprehensive review by Autier et al. [65] concluded that low concentrations of 25(OH)D are most likely an effect of health disorders and not a cause of illness. Commenting on the findings in a press statement, Autier et al. [64] advised against vitamin D supplementation and explained the observed discrepancy between observational and randomized trials:
Decreases in vitamin D levels are a marker of deteriorating health. Ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course reduce vitamin D concentrations, which would explain why vitamin D deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders. We postulate that inflammation is the common factor between most nonskeletal health disorders and low 25(OH)D concentrations. Inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course would reduce 25(OH)D, which would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide range of disorders. However, increases in 25(OH)D have no effect on inflammatory processes or on disorders at the origin of these processes.
A 2014 meta-analysis by Bolland et al. [66] on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on skeletal, vascular, or cancer outcomes concludes that vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium does not reduce skeletal or non-skeletal outcomes in unselected community-dwelling individuals by more than 15 %. The authors further state that future trials with similar designs are unlikely to alter these conclusions. Because of emerging concerns about elevated 25(OH)D, the IOM has shifted the paradigm from thinking about ‘more is better’ to a more risk-averse approach [67]. It has also challenged the notion that harm should be viewed in terms of vitamin D toxicity such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or metastatic calcification and has advanced the concept of ‘harm’ in terms of chronic disease outcomes and mortality [16]. Because adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation may take decades to be realized, clinicians (mindful of the medical ethics precept ‘‘First, do no harm’’) should err on the side of caution; follow the IOM guideline and wait for the results of longterm vitamin D studies.
!!!!Bacterial pathogenesis of low vitamin D hypothesis
If evidence indicates that most people get adequate vitamin D from sunlight exposure but healthy persons are found to be ‘deficient’ by recent standards, what is the explanation for this phenomenon? Vitamin D proponents use a disease deficiency model to explain low levels of 25(OH)D. Their hypothesis states low 25(OH)D causes chronic diseases; however, a pathogenesis has not been elucidated [68]. Low serum 25(OH)D in the presence of disease can also be explained with a dysregulated vitamin D metabolism model [69]. This hypothesis proposes that low vitamin D is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process caused by persistent infection. The bacterial pathogenesis theorizes that intracellular (cell wall deficient) bacteria invade nucleated cells, use strategies to avoid destruction and cause abnormal vitamin D endocrine function, resulting in low vitamin D. Excess 1,25(OH)2D is produced in an effort to up-regulate the VDR to transcribe AMPs; and 25(OH)D is rapidly metabolized in the process, resulting in a low serum level. The resulting elevated 1,25(OH)2D causes chronic, systemic inflammation and its accompanying symptoms (Fig. 3).
The existence of bacteria which are capable of invading human cells has been known for over a century and are described by many authors [70, 71]. The lack of a cell wall enables them to enter human cells and proliferate because they fail to elicit an appropriate response when the immune system is compromised. In particular, they enter the macrophages—the very immune cells deployed to kill invading pathogens. The inability of most research labs to culture cell wall deficient (CWD) bacteria has been an obstacle to their acceptance, and reliance on Koch’s postulates has made it difficult to correlate CWD bacteria to specific diseases [72]. But some researchers believe Koch’s postulates may have to be redefined in terms of molecular data when dormant and non-culturable bacteria are implicated as causative agents of mysterious diseases [73]. OConnor et al. [74] (in their article entitled Emerging Infectious Determinants of Chronic Diseases) report, ‘‘microbes can now be irrefutably linked to pathology without meeting Koch’s postulates” and “...powerful tools of molecular biology have exposed new causal links by detecting diffi- cult-to-culture and novel agents in chronic illness settings.’’ Domingue [75] commented, ‘‘This might translate into an etiology for chronic inflammatory diseases, when the stressed bacteria increase in numbers and overwhelm the normal biological functions of the host.’’ Nunez [76] was quoted in the University of Michigan Health System newsletter, ‘‘In our study, the presence of bacterial microbes inside the cell is what triggers the immune response.’’ Rolhion and Darfeuille-Michaud [77] observed that the presence of pathogenic invasive bacteria could be the link between an innate immune response to invasive bacteria and the development of inflammation. A number of studies suggest disease associations with CWD bacteria [78-83]. Verway et al. [79] report ‘‘.data suggest that at least a subset of the genetic predisposition to Crohn’s disease results from defects in the detection and/or processing of intracellular pathogens by the innate immune system.’’ O’Connor et al. [74] state, ‘‘The epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features of many chronic inflammatory diseases are consistent with a microbial cause. Infectious agents likely determine more cancers, immune-mediated syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other chronic conditions than currently appreciated.”
CWD bacteria are considered communicable but not contagious; protective immunity depends on an effective cell-mediated immune response [80]. It is now well appreciated that pathologic processes caused by infectious agents may only emerge clinically after an incubation of decades [81]. Among the speculated causes of the increase in chronic infections are overuse of beta-lactam antibiotics [82, 83] and immunosuppression via excess 25(OH)D production [84] or immunosuppressive medications [85]. Many microbiologists now believe at least some, if not all, of the inflammation which drives the chronic disease process is caused by the presence of these stealthy intracellular pathogens [86]. A considerable body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the concept that difficult-to- culture and dormant bacteria are involved in latency of infection and that these persistent bacteria may be pathogenic [73, 87, 88]. McDougal [89] states, ‘‘Evidence now confirms that non-communicable chronic diseases can stem from infectious agents.’’
!!!!Effects of intracellular pathogens on the immune system
Pathogens gain many advantages by parasitizing immune cells and altering nuclear receptor activity. Tissue invasion provides a privileged niche with access to host protein and iron, sequestration from immune response, and a means for persistence [90]. In the arms race of host-microbe coevolution, successful microbial pathogens have evolved innovative strategies to evade host immune responses. For example, ‘crosstalk manipulation’ undermines host defenses and contributes to microbial adaptive fitness [91, 92]. Pathogenic microbes also induce stress responses which protect the cell from lethal factors, express proteases that degrade AMPs, use biofilms as a shield and modulate host cell motility to facilitate establishment of an infection [93, 94]. Genetic foreign and host protein interactions alter gene transcription and translation mechanisms, and many species survive by horizontal gene transfer [95, 96].
It is theorized that bacteria have developed some of these strategies in order to invade host cells and remain undetected within cellular cytoplasm. Many bacterial pathogens form antibiotic-tolerant persister cells which can replicate within macrophages. In this form they can cause subclinical infection and have been associated with chronic diseases [95, 97, 98]. Intracellular bacteria can modulate cytokine production [99]; and in monocytes and macrophages, cytokine activation markedly inhibits 1,25(OH)2D/ VDR gene transcription [100].
Macrophage microbicidal mechanisms are responsible for the control and elimination of pathogens. 1,25(OH)2D production and action in macrophages activates toll-like receptors to increase expression of the AMP cathelicidin which kills infectious invaders [101, 102]. When the immune system is fighting a persistent microbe, inflammatory molecules are continuously released in an effort to kill the pathogen [103]. Immune defenses stimulate Th17 cells and contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory conditions [104,	105]. An ineffective immunological response causes low-grade inflammation and hagocyte-inflicted tissue damage plays an important role in many chronic diseases [106]; autoimmune patients acquire a distinct pathogenic microbiota and multi-morbidity often results [107, 108]. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that bacteria have evolved strategies which allow them to persist within host cells. The exact mechanisms are unknown and warrant further study.
!!!!The compromised immune system, infection and vitamin D
In an essay on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and immune response, Smith [109] postulated that unresolved cellular stress may be caused by infectious agents to avoid adaptive immune responses. The host immune response has developed many mechanisms to neutralize and remove pathogenic bacteria. In turn, pathogenic bacteria have developed mechanisms to alter and evade the host immune response [110, 111]. Regulation of the VDR is a common mechanism used in the host defense against pathogens but certain microbes have been shown to slow innate immune defenses by down-regulating the VDR:
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis down-regulates VDR activity [112].
*Mycobacterium leprae inhibits VDR activity through down-regulation of CYP27B1 in monocytes [113].
*Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a toxin capable of down-regulating the VDR in macrophages [114].
*Epstein-Barr virus lowers VDR activity [115].
*HIV completely shuts down VDR activity [116].
*In VDR knockout mice, a circumstance that closely mimics extreme VDR dysregulation, 1,25(OH)2D levels increase by a factor of ten [117].
Studies also point to immune system depression and elevated 1,25(OH)2D in chronic diseases [118]:
*Sarcoidosis patients are deficient in cathelicidin despite healthy vitamin D3 levels [119].
*1,25(OH)2D is high (>60 pg/ml) in 42 % of Crohn’s patients and the source of the active vitamin D may be the inflamed intestine [52].
*1,25(OH)2D is elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with RA (rheumatoid arthritis) [120].
*Crohn’s disease decreases expression of cathelicidin [121].
High levels of 1,25(OH)2D may result when down- regulation of the VDR by bacterial ligands prevents the receptor from expressing enzymes necessary to keep 1,25(OH)2D in a normal range [42]. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D further reduces VDR competence, suppresses macrophage function, and blocks the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway; thus inhibiting immune system function [116, 122, 123]. Reducing the ability of the VDR to express elements of innate immune function allows intracellular bacteria to persist in the cytoplasm of nucleated cells and may account for the increased susceptibility to non-bacterial co-infections that are commonly found in patients with chronic illnesses [124, 125]. Theoretically, immune system suppression allows parasitic microbes to persist and proliferate in host phagocytes, successfully compete for nutritional resources, and displace commensal organisms from their niche [126]. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D appears to be evidence of a disabled immune system’s attempt to activate the VDR to combat infection.
!!!!Autoimmune disease
Numerous examples can be found in which pathogens express antigens that cross-react with host antigens or induce local inflammatory responses that can lead to autoimmune responses through a very complex set of circumstances [127]. The prevailing theory regarding the etiology of autoimmune disease states that an overactive immune system produces auto-antibodies against self, but infection as an environmental factor in autoimmunity has long been recognized. An alternate hypothesis posits a bacterial etiology in which a persistent intracellular infection causes a cytokine release that induces signals to T cells and B cells, and the antibodies they produce (to the intracellular invader) include some that attack human proteins, as well as target the pathogens [128, 129]. Christen et al. [130] explored this hypothesis, ‘‘In theory, a structural similarity or identity between the host and an invading pathogen might cause the immune system of the host to react not only to the pathogen but also to self-components.’’ Infections can act as environmental triggers inducing or promoting autoimmune disease in genetically predisposed individuals [131]; researchers have shown how antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are created in response to infectious agents [132, 133].
Vitamin D appears to have a positive effect on autoimmune disease due to immune system suppression [122, 134, 135] and immune suppression is considered therapeutically beneficial for autoimmune diseases [136, 137]. However, vitamin D proponents have failed to recognize that positive effects are due to the immunosuppressive effect of elevated 25(OH)D or to understand that immunosuppression is contraindicated because of the probable presence of intracellular infection. When the immune system is suppressed clinical disease markers and symptoms are reduced but immunosuppression does not address an underlying cause of persistent bacteria, thus relapse is common [138]. Verway et al. [79] wonder, ‘‘Is a specific pathogen responsible for disease or rather is a dysregulated immune response generated against a complex microbial population? Why would immune-suppressive drugs be efficacious if the primary defect is an immune deficiency?” Much of current research focuses on finding drugs to suppress inflammation but, according to Collins [139], 95 % of these studies have failed It seems clear a better direction is needed. Immunotherapy which restores VDR competence corrects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and eliminates intracellular bacteria could be the answer (as discussed in the section titled Restoring VDR Competence).
!!!!Dysregulated vitamin D metabolism
In a healthy individual, the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity cooperates to mount an appropriate response to infection through regulation of the vitamin D endocrine system [140]. The immune system detects and responds to the presence of intracellular bacteria by producing more 1,25(OH)2D to activate the VDR and express the crucial endogenous AMPs which enable the innate immune system to target intracellular pathogens [141]. Renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is tightly selfregulated, with the end product down-regulating its own further production. In contrast, extra-renal tissues (e.g., uterine decidua and placenta, colon, breast, prostate, spleen, bone, keratinocytes, melanoma and synovial cells, pulmonary monocytes and macrophages, etc.) which produce 1,25(OH)2D are regulated by cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma), lipopolysaccharide, nitric oxide and intracellular VDBP, which activate the enzyme CYP27B1 to stimulate conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D [142]. This extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D in tissues infected with intracellular bacteria can result in an excess in production of 1,25(OH)2D which may contribute to depletion and low levels of 25(OH)D [143] (Fig. 4).
Because extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is primarily dependent on the availability of 25(OH)D [144], supplementation with vitamin D to increase 25(OH)D may promote the production of 1,25(OH)2D in non-renal tissues that are sites of intracellular infection and result in hypervitaminosis-D

{img attId="4412"}
Fig. 4 Proposed hypothesis for excess 1,25(OH)2D production in bacterially-stimulated extrarenal tissues. Extra-renal tissues, which produce 1,25(OH)2D, are regulated by cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, nitric oxide and intracellular VDBP, which activate the enzyme CYP27B1 to stimulate conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, resulting in low 25(OH)D

{img attId="4413"}
Fig. 5 Proposed hypothesis for dysregulated vitamin D metabolism caused by intracellular pathogens. Theoretically, when nucleated cells are parasitized by intracellular bacteria, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D increases, the kidneys lose control of 1,25(OH)2D production, and pro-hormone 25(OH)D decreases due to rapid conversion to 1,25(OH)2D

Sunlight appears to play a part in this process and many patients with autoimmune disease report sun sensitivity. The skin (dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes possess VDR) has the capacity to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D, and represents an important target tissue for 1,25(OH)2D [145]. If keratinocytes in the skin are infected, natural regulation of photosynthesis may be thwarted and solar energy may overstimulate cellular activity, resulting in an increase in cutaneous production of vitamin D3, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D following sun exposure.
We hypothesize that when nucleated cells are parasitized by intracellular bacteria, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D increases, the kidneys lose control of 1,25(OH)2D production, and pro-hormone 25(OH)D decreases due to rapid conversion to 1,25(OH)2D. 
The following mechanisms are thought to be responsible (Fig. 5):
*Inflammatory cytokines activate CYP27B1, an enzyme that causes more 25(OH)D to be converted to 1,25(OH)2D [146].
*The microbial-repressed VDR cannot transcribe CYP24A1 (formerly 24-hydroxylase), an enzyme that breaks down excess 1,25(OH)2D [147].
*Excess 1,25(OH)2D binds the PXR (pregnane X receptor), to inhibit conversion of vitamin D3 to 25(OH)D so 25(OH)D is down-regulated [148].
*1,25(OH)2D inhibits the hepatic synthesis of 25(OH)D [149].
Thus, low 25(OH)D may be a consequence of the inflammatory process. More studies are concluding that suboptimal circulating levels of vitamin D appear to be caused by the disease process. Waldronn et al. [150] found serum 25(OH)D was decreased following an acute inflammatory insult (i.e., orthopedic surgery) and concluded that hypovitaminosis-D may be the consequence rather than cause of chronic inflammatory diseases. Ferder et al. [151] state, there may be a relationship between inflammatory processes induced by chronic overstimulation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the worldwide vitamin D deficiency. In fact, the pandemic of vitamin D deficiency could be the other face of increased RAS activity, which could potentially cause a lower activity or lower levels of Vitamin D.’’
!!!!Diagnosis of dysregulated vitamin D metabolism
Assessing dysregulated vitamin D metabolism has the potential to guide clinical practice [152, 153]. Vitamin D status is currently determined by measuring the level of serum 25(OH)D which, presumably, reflects the serum levels of other vitamin D metabolites (e.g., vitamin D3, vitamin D2 and 1,25(OH)2D, etc.). This measurement may not, however, provide enough information to assess vitamin D endocrine function. The clinical utility of measuring 1,25(OH)D is not fully understood, but it is clear that associations are being made between this active metabolite of vitamin D and disease states [154]. 1,25(OH)2D is not being used as a measure associated with vitamin D nutritional status or as an intermediate marker related to health outcomes, or even routinely assessed in vitamin D research. In the context of solving the puzzle of low 25(OH)D, the reasons cited for this lapse fail to consider the possibility of abnormal levels in the presence of chronic inflammation:
*1,25(OH)2D has a short half-life (hours) and fluctuates rapidly.
+However, a high result may be discovered even at trough level.
*1,25(OH)2D levels are regulated by PTH, calcium, phosphate.
+This is not true if extra-renal production is prevalent [143].
*1,25(OH)2D does not decrease until 25(OH)D is very low.
+A low 25(OH)D may be a sign that 1,25(OH)2D is abnormally high [55].
*1,25(OH)2D is only over-produced in hypercalcemic disease states such as sarcoidosis.
+Studies show this is not true [42].
*1,25(OH)2D may be elevated as a result of up- regulation of the CYP27B1 enzyme.
+This begs the question, Why is this enzyme elevated [146]?
Measuring both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D (and PTH, calcium, phosphate when indicated) as clinical markers in
Table 1 D-metabolites tests
Serum 25(OH)D [157]
CPT code: 82306 [157]
Lowest mortality reported at 20 ng/ml [158] Immunosuppression reported when higher than 30 ng/ml [122] Serum 1,25(OH)2D [157]
CPT code: 82652 [157]
ICD-9 code:
275.40 Disorder of calcium metabolism, unspecified [157] Maximum normal = 45 pg/ml [17]
chronic disease is more likely to provide a true picture of vitamin D status, than measuring 25(OH)D alone [155, 156] (Table 1). Measuring 1,25(OH)2D should be considered in patients with low 25(OH)D, abnormal laboratory results (especially inflammatory markers), a diagnosis of autoimmune disease or other chronic inflammatory illness, or signs of chronic systemic inflammation. For example, elevated 1,25(OH)2D may serve as a marker of Crohn’s disease [52]. The 1,25(OH)2D test is a delicate assay which is only done in specialized laboratories. False low results have been observed due to apparent sample mishandling; freezing for transport is advised to prevent sample degradation due to agitation. A high result is always accurate.
!!!!Restoration of VDR competence
The ability to mount an appropriate immune system response to intracellular infection is highly dependent on a competent VDR [159]. When it appears that 1,25(OH)2D is unable to up-regulate the VDR due to microbial activity, VDR competence may be restored with another VDR ligand which acts as an agonist; an agonist increases the signal transduction activity of a cell when bound to a receptor on that cell. Over 3000 synthetic VDR ligands have been identified, but most of these 1,25(OH)2D analogues have no clinical use because of their undue disruption to calcium regulation [160]. A number of nonvitamin D VDR ligands have also been identified: curcu- min, omega-6 fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid, linoleic acid), and lithocolic acid (LCA) but are not being used for this purpose [161, 162].
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown, via in silico molecular modeling, to modulate VDR activation [163]. The most promising ARB, __olmesartan__ medoxomil (brand name Benicar®) was estimated to have a Ki value in the low nanomolar range, similar to the Ki values of the natural VDR ligands [163].

{img attId="4414"}
Fig. 6 Proposed hypothesis for restoring renal control of 1,25(OH)2D with __olmesartan__. __olmesartan__ is believed to decrease elevated 1,25(OH)2D by several mechanisms

__Olmesartan__ has been noted to cause a significant reduction in elevated 1,25(OH)2D within weeks of initiation, which provides
further evidence of its ability to up-regulate the VDR [164]. __olmesartan__ is believed to decrease elevated 1,25(OH)2D by several VDR-mediated effects (Fig. 6). The up-regulated VDR:
*transcribes CYP24A1 and CYP3A4 (enzymes which reduce 1,25(OH)2D production) [147].
*represses CYP27B1 (the enzyme that hydroxylates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D) so less 1,25(OH)2D is produced [146].
Consequently, renal control of 1,25(OH)2D production is restored and extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is reduced. A decrease in elevated 1,25(OH)2D means less systemic inflammation, as these studies of __olmesartan__ indicate:
*Improvement of glycemic control and insulin resistance was only observed in the __olmesartan__ group and these effects of __olmesartan__ might be mediated by an antiinflammatory action [165].
*__Olmesartan__ treatment significantly reduced serum levels of inflammatory markers; h-CRP, h-TNFa, IL-6, MCP-1 after 6 weeks of therapy [166].
*Blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme induces potent regulatory T cells and modulates TH1- and TH17-mediated autoimmunity [167].
*Blocking angiotensin II receptor increases bone mass [168, 169].
__Olmesartan__ acts in a manner similar to 1,25(OH)2D to reduce inflammation and, by inference, improve immune system function. VDR and RAS receptors are distributed in almost the same tissues. The endogenous VDR ligand 1,25(OH)2D down-regulates the RAS by repressing renin gene expression to reduce inflammation via the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway [170]. __olmesartan__ has a similar effect in that it reduces angiotensin II (a peptide that is implicated in the inflammatory process) [171]. Inappropriate stimulation of the RAS has been associated with the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart attack and stroke [151]. Ferder et al. [151] state, ‘‘Changes in RAS activity and activation of the VDR seem to be inversely related, making it possible to speculate that both systems could have a feedback relationship. The combination of RAS blockade and VDR stimulation appears to be more effective than each one used individually.” Blocking angiotensin II and stimulating the VDR is what __olmesartan__ appears to accomplish and this function is consistent with a theory of VDR incompetence (Fig. 7).
In patients with autoimmune disorders and inflammatory symptoms, __olmesartan__ is noted to provoke an increase in inflammatory symptoms indicative of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR). JHR is a cascade of reactions including inflammation, cytokine release, and endotoxin release as part of the immune response to the disintegration of infected cells [172]. This immunopathology suggests transcription of AMPs by an activated VDR, points to the presence of occult infection and provides additional evidence that __olmesartan__ is a VDR agonist [167, 173, 174]. Theoretically, __olmesartan__ restores VDR competence and, thus, phagocytosis leads to bacterial death; consequently, inflammation is temporarily increased by cytokine reaction to microbial endotoxins and cellular debris from dead host cells and bacteria [175].
Hajishengallis and Lambris [92] conclude that a blockade of hijacked receptors of the innate immune system may offer promising options to control infection and associated immunopathology. Although this use of __olmesartan__ is off- label, its safety profile is well established [176]. The multiple, documented beneficial effects of __olmesartan__, including the ability to reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease, prevent migraines, and reduce oxidative stress, also suggest it could play a key role in the resolution of chronic systemic inflammation [177, 178].
!!!!Clinical use of __olmesartan__
__Olmesartan__ is being used as a novel VDR ligand in the clinical setting [179]. Immunotherapy with __olmesartan__ may also include pulsed administration of select MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) oral antibiotics to weaken and help eradicate the intracellular pathogens. With each antibiotic dose, inflammatory symptoms (JHR) wax and wane, providing further evidence of persistent infection [180]. Changes in laboratory findings (e.g., BUN, creatinine, CRP, blood counts, liver enzymes) often point to areas of occult inflammation. A correlating treatment strategy is the avoidance of excessive sunlight exposure, foods high in vitamin D and vitamin D supplements to maintain serum 25(OH)D at a level (20-30 ng/ml) that is not likely to suppress the immune system and inhibit bacterial elimination [122, 135, 137].
Accumulating case reports now support the observation that a number of complex, chronic conditions can be improved by restoring VDR function using this type of immunotherapy [179, 181, 182]. It is becoming increasingly clear that microbes slow down immune reactivity by dysregulating the VDR, ultimately to increase their chance of survival. Immune modulatory therapies that enhance VDR expression and activity should, therefore, be considered in the clinical setting [183].
!!!!Discussion
Vitamin D is essential for many important biological processes and most people get an adequate supply from exposure to sunlight (Table 2). Long-term studies are needed to determine if low 25(OH)D in healthy individuals leads to disease. Evidence that vitamin D supplementation cures or prevents chronic disease is inconsistent. Despite increased supplementation chronic inflammatory diseases are on the rise. Attention to the alternate hypothesis—low 25(OH)D is a consequence of the chronic disease process, provoked by persistent intracellular infection—may be crucial to reversing this trend and needs further research.

!!!!Table 2 Key points
*Vitamin D is a steroid hormone which regulates immune system function
*Photosynthesis of vitamin D3 provides adequate vitamin D stores for most individuals
*Low levels of 25(OH)D are seen in healthy individuals, as well as those with chronic inflammatory conditions
*Studies are inconsistent regarding the health benefits of increasing vitamin D stores; vitamin D supplementation may have negative effects
*25(OH)D may not always reflect the level of 1,25(OH)D; accurate assessment of vitamin D status depends on measuring both metabolites
*Intracellular, cell wall deficient bacteria may cause dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and impaired immune system function
*A novel, non-vitamin D VDR ligand (an angiotensin receptor blocker) appears to 
+reactivate the immune system, 
+restore VDR competence, 
+correct dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and 
+reduce inflammatory symptoms
The prevailing dogma that the level of serum 25(OH)D provides an accurate assessment of vitamin D status needs closer examination. Circulating levels of 25(OH)D may not be an accurate reflection of vitamin D status. In those with an autoimmune disease or chronic inflammatory symptoms, 1,25(OH)2D may be elevated. This can lead to osteoporosis and cause inhibition of innate immunity, which is contraindicated in the presence of infection. The resulting immunosuppression may promote persistentinfection which has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases.
Human cells live in harmony with many types of microbes but some microbes may become pathogenic under commonly experienced conditions. The innate immune system is designed to kill pathogens via 1,25(OH)2D- mediated VDR transcription of anti-microbial peptides but microbes may use strategies which down-regulate the VDR in order to live and reproduce within nucleated host cells. Studies using more advanced cell culture and molecular techniques are confirming the presence of previously undetected intracellular bacteria. Defense mechanisms that intracellular bacteria use to persist and proliferate need to be investigated. Pathogen-induced VDR dysfunction which causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines appears to be at the root of chronic disease and low 25(OH)D. Improving VDR activation may be the key to reducing inflammatory diseases. Treatments that up-regulate the VDR to restore normal immune function, reduce inflammation and eradicate persistent bacterial infections require further research. An immunotherapy which has demonstrated efficacy in reversing vitamin D metabolism dysfunction and reducing inflammatory symptoms is currently being used by clinicians and warrants formal study.
In summary, elevated 1,25(OH)2D, often accompanied by reduced 25(OH)D, is a clinical sign of dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and evidence that the immune system is competing with parasitic microbes for VDR dominance. Failure of the immune system to mount an effective anti-microbial response results in persistent intracellular infection. This induces relentless inflammation (immunopathology) which causes tissue damage and disease symptoms.

&lt;h3 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Vitamin K acts as a cofactor for the endoplasmic enzyme y-glutamyl carboxylase, during post-translational conversion of glutamic acid residues to y-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) in specific proteins. These proteins are referred to as vitamin K-dependent proteins, and include several blood coagulation factors and anti-coagulation factors, which are synthesized in the liver; Osteocalcin(OC), a bone-specific protein synthesized by osteoblasts; and Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), which is synthesized in several organs. Recently, considerable attention has been directed towards these vitamin K-dependent Gla proteins; their role in bone metabolism; and their inhibitory effect on artery calcification. The current average intake of vitamin K from a normal diet in healthy adults is greater than that required for normal blood coagulation, but is insufficient for extra hepatic tissue requirements &lt;sup>[1,2]&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chance of death after non-cardiac surgery reduced 2X by Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/chance-of-death-after-non-cardiac-surgery-reduced-2x-by-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chance-of-death-after-non-cardiac-surgery-reduced-2x-by-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-association-of-serum-vitamin-d-concentration-with-serious-complications-after-noncardiac-surgery">The Association of Serum Vitamin D Concentration with Serious Complications After Noncardiac Surgery.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a significant global health problem because of the increased risk of total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is common in patients with CKD, and serum levels of vitamin D appear to have an inverse correlation with kidney function. Growing evidence has indicated that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to deteriorating renal function, as well as increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Recent studies have suggested that treatment with active vitamin D or its analogues can ameliorate renal injury by reducing fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation in animal models; this treatment also decreases proteinuria and mortality in patients with CKD. These renoprotective effects of vitamin D treatment are far beyond its classical role in the maintenance of bone and mineral metabolism, in addition to its pleiotropic effects on extra-mineral metabolism. In this review, we discuss the altered metabolism of vitamin D in kidney disease, and the potential renoprotective mechanisms of vitamin D in experimental and clinical studies. In addition, issues regarding the effects of vitamin D treatment on clinical outcomes are discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pancreatic cancer 30 percent less likely in Australians who got lots of UVB (vitamin D)</title><link>/posts/pancreatic-cancer-30-percent-less-likely-in-australians-who-got-lots-of-uvb-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pancreatic-cancer-30-percent-less-likely-in-australians-who-got-lots-of-uvb-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="association-between-ultraviolet-radiation-skin-sun-sensitivity-and-risk-of-pancreatic-cancer">Association between ultraviolet radiation, skin sun sensitivity and risk of pancreatic cancer.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ecological studies showing an inverse association between pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality and levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), suggest that higher levels of sun exposure may reduce risks of pancreatic cancer but there has been only one individual-level study that examined this issue. We aimed to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and markers of exposure to solar UVR, namely skin type, treatment of skin lesions, ambient UVR and time outdoors on work days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Antibiotics and Vitamin D are associated with many of the same diseases</title><link>/posts/antibiotics-and-vitamin-d-are-associated-with-many-of-the-same-diseases.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/antibiotics-and-vitamin-d-are-associated-with-many-of-the-same-diseases.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="misc-notes-from-the-book-missing-microbes">Misc. notes from the book Missing Microbes&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D is essential for bone health and probably the health of most nonskeletal tissues. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, and recommended doses are usually inadequate to maintain healthy levels. We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine whether the recommended doses of vitamin D are adequate to correct deficiency and maintain normal levels in a population seeking health care. We also sought to develop a predictive equation for replacement doses of vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UK would save as least 636 million dollars annually by giving 800 IU vitamin D free to all seniors</title><link>/posts/uk-would-save-as-least-636-million-dollars-annually-by-giving-800-iu-vitamin-d-free-to-all-seniors.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/uk-would-save-as-least-636-million-dollars-annually-by-giving-800-iu-vitamin-d-free-to-all-seniors.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="note-2-publications-on-this-page-by-the-same-authors">Note: 2 publications on this page by the same authors:&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Observational studies suggest that effects of vitamin D may be stronger for cancer mortality than for incidence. Yet, existing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation have limited power to examine the relationships as their primary end points are not cancer incidence or mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels around the world - DSM review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-around-the-world-dsm-review.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-around-the-world-dsm-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="31-vitamin-d-a-critical-and-essential-micronutrient-for-human-health">3.1 Vitamin D: a critical and essential micronutrient for human health&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Vitamin D plays a key role in immune function. Deficiency may aggravate the incidence and outcome of infectious complications in critically ill patients.

&lt;p>Mortality from colorectal cancer increases with latitude and decreases with ambient UV radiation. We investigated whether moderate UV dosages could inhibit intestinal tumor development and whether this corresponded with UV-induced vitamin D. FabplCre;Apc15lox/+ mice, which develop &lt;strong>intestinal tumors&lt;/strong> , and their parents were put on a vitamin D-deficient diet. Next to a control group, one group was vitamin D supplemented and another one group was daily UV irradiated from 6 weeks of age. Vitamin D statuses after 6 weeks of treatment were markedly increased: mean ± SD from 7.7 ± 1.9 in controls to 75 ± 15 nmol/l with vitamin D supplementation (no gender difference), and to 31 ± 13 nmol/l in males and 85 ± 17 nmol/l in females upon UV irradiation. The tumor load (area covered by tumors) at 7.5 months of age was significantly reduced in both the vitamin D-supplemented group (130 ± 25 mm2 , p = 0.018) and the UV-exposed group (88 ± 9 mm2 , p &amp;lt; 0.0005; no gender differences) compared to the control group (202 ± 23 mm2 ). No reductions in tumor numbers were found. Only UV exposure appeared to reduce progression to malignancy (p = 0.014). Our experiments clearly demonstrate for the first time an inhibitory effect of moderate UV exposure on outgrowth and malignant progression of primary intestinal tumors, which at least in part can be attributed to vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diabetes onset at age 76 was weakly associated with low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/diabetes-onset-at-age-76-was-weakly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/diabetes-onset-at-age-76-was-weakly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-incidence-of-diabetes-in-elderly-people-the-prova-study">SERUM 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D AND INCIDENCE OF DIABETES IN ELDERLY PEOPLE: THE PRO.V.A STUDY&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency has increased in the general population and become an important public health issue.1 Vitamin D is mainly known for its favorable effects in calcium and bone metabolism. However, increasing numbers of studies have established that vitamin D insufficiency contributes to a number of diseases, suggesting a range of physiological functions of vitamin D.M Several clinical studies have confirmed that vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating innate immune responses toward various pathogens.5 Moreover, recent studies indicate that vitamin D can regulate the adaptive immune response in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.6,7 These results suggest the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in decreasing the risk and adverse outcomes of inflammatory diseases, although the precise effect remains to be elucidated in large clinical trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blood tests can be a poor measure of actual vitamin D due to D Binding Protein (DBP)</title><link>/posts/blood-tests-can-be-a-poor-measure-of-actual-vitamin-d-due-to-d-binding-protein-dbp.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blood-tests-can-be-a-poor-measure-of-actual-vitamin-d-due-to-d-binding-protein-dbp.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vitamin D Binding Protein Impact on 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels under Different Physiologic and Pathologic Conditions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D has long been recognized for its central role in calcium homeostasis and in the maintenance of skeletal health due to its effects on intestinal calcium absorption. More recently, however, an ever expanding array of studies have suggested that vitamin D may play a pivotal role across much of the human health and disease spectrum—including in such diverse conditions as cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, diabetes, fall risk, immune disorders, infections, and pregnancy, among others (1).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Type 2 Diabetes helped by Omega-3 and Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/type-2-diabetes-helped-by-omega-3-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/type-2-diabetes-helped-by-omega-3-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="color:#F00;">Update Dec 2016&lt;/span> - Omega-3 (without Vitamin D) is associated with &lt;strong>increased&lt;/strong> Type II Diabetes&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vascular calcification (VC), commonly encountered in renal failure, diabetes, and aging, is associated with a large increase in the risk for cardiovascular events and mortality. Calcification of the arterial media and of heart valves clearly plays a mediating role in this regard, whereas it is less clear how calcification of plaque influences atherogenesis and risk for plaque rupture. Vascular calcification is an active process in which vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) adopt an osteoblastic phenotype and deposit hydroxyapatite crystals; apoptosis of VSMCs also promotes this deposition. Drivers of this phenotypic transition, which include elevated serum phosphate, advanced glycation end-products, bone morphogenetic proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and leptin, invariably induce oxidative stress in VSMCs, which appears to be a necessary and sufficient condition for induction of the runt-related transcription factor 2 gene (RUNX2) and the shift to osteoblastic behavior. Magnesium antagonizes the impact of phosphate on VSMC osteoblastic transition, both by a direct effect within VSMCs and by suppressing absorption of dietary phosphate. Antioxidants that suppress reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity may have the potential to block the osteoblastic transition of VSMCs. Minimizing the absorption of dietary phosphate may also be helpful in this regard, particularly in renal failure, and it can be achieved with plant-based dietary choices, avoidance of phosphate additives, and administration of pharmaceutical phosphate binders, supplemental magnesium, and niacin. Good vitamin K status opposes VC by optimizing the γ-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a physiological antagonist of VC. Adequate but not excessive vitamin D status also appears to discourage VC. Etidronate, a structural analogue of pyrophosphate, has shown potential for blocking VC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancer survival 4 percent more likely with just a little more vitamin D (4 ng) - meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/cancer-survival-4-percent-more-likely-with-just-a-little-more-vitamin-d-4-ng-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-survival-4-percent-more-likely-with-just-a-little-more-vitamin-d-4-ng-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Objectives&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aimed to explore the association between vitamin D levels and the severity, mortality and microbiological etiology of community-acquired pneumonia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D levels (both, the reservoir form 25-OH and the activated form 1,25-OH2) of 300 randomly selected patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to pre-specified pathogens included in the German competence network (CAPNETZ) study were measured. Prior to statistical analysis, values of 25-OH and 1,25-OH2 were power-transformed to achieve parametric distribution. All further analyses were performed with seasonally and age adjusted values.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Increased chance of death if enter hospital with vitamin D greater than 60 ng (u-shaped)</title><link>/posts/increased-chance-of-death-if-enter-hospital-with-vitamin-d-greater-than-60-ng-u-shaped.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/increased-chance-of-death-if-enter-hospital-with-vitamin-d-greater-than-60-ng-u-shaped.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

Of the 180 patients enrolled, 129 were included. Vitamin D3 deficiency was observed in 37 % (n = 48) and supra-physiological levels (≥250 nmol/L) in 15.5 % (n = 20). Patients with supraphysiological vitamin D3 levels were grouped as outliers. There was no difference in mortality (p = 0.41) between vitamin D3 deficient (21/48) and non-deficient (36/81) patients in analysis with and without outliers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No vitamin D test needed before supplementing (typically)</title><link>/posts/no-vitamin-d-test-needed-before-supplementing-typically.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-vitamin-d-test-needed-before-supplementing-typically.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="testing-vitamin-d-levels">Testing vitamin D levels&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Osteoporotic fracture significant causes morbidity and mortality, is a challenged global health problem. The previous reports of the relation between vitamin A intake or blood retinol and risk of fracture were inconsistent. We searched Medline and Embase to assess the effects of vitamin A (or retinol or beta-carotene, but not vitamin A metabolites) on risk of hip and total fracture. Only prospective studies were included. We pooled data with a random effects meta-analysis with adj. RR (adjusted relative risk) and 95% CI (confidence interval). We used Q statistic and I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity and Egger&amp;rsquo;s test to assess publication bias.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Death due to breast cancer reduced 40 percent if high vitamin D – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/death-due-to-breast-cancer-reduced-40-percent-if-high-vitamin-d-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/death-due-to-breast-cancer-reduced-40-percent-if-high-vitamin-d-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-intake-blood-25ohd-levels-and-breast-cancer-risk-or-mortality-a-meta-analysis">Vitamin D intake, blood 25(OH)D levels, and breast cancer risk or mortality: a meta-analysis&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Experimental studies suggest potential anti-carcinogenic properties of vitamin D against breast cancer risk, but the epidemiological evidence to date is inconsistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases along with a hand search for eligible studies to examine the association between vitamin D status (based on diet and blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)) and breast cancer risk or mortality in a meta-analysis. A random-effect model was used to calculate a pooled adjusted relative risk (RR).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and neurocognitive function – Holick</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-neurocognitive-function-holick.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-neurocognitive-function-holick.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: &lt;a href="/posts/vitamin-d-and-neurocognitive-function-holick">Update by same authors with same title 8 years later&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With recent headlines like Vitamin D Enhances Breast Cancer Survival, a woman could hardly be faulted for running out and stacking up on Vitamin D pills. The meta-analysis study (a compilation of studies) upon which this headline and similar ones are based, was published in Anticancer Research and showed that the higher the Vitamin D level at the time of diagnosis, the better the prognosis. On the surface, this would suggest a cause and effect relationship. To the untrained eye, one might conclude that raising Vitamin D levels has some type of anti-cancer effect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hearts responded to stress better after 5,000 IU of vitamin D for a month</title><link>/posts/hearts-responded-to-stress-better-after-5000-iu-of-vitamin-d-for-a-month.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hearts-responded-to-stress-better-after-5000-iu-of-vitamin-d-for-a-month.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-is-associated-with-improved-modulation-of-cardiac-autonomic-tone-in-healthy-humans">Vitamin D supplementation is associated with improved modulation of cardiac autonomic tone in healthy humans&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Balance problems and falls are a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D supplementation reduces falls and sway in neurologically intact elderly fallers, but effects in Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease are not established.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>METHODS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To study this relationship and select outcome measures for a vitamin D intervention study, balance function and vitamin D concentration were quantified in a series of Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s patients in a cross-sectional, observational study. Participants underwent a battery of 5 balance tests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More survive Breast Cancer if more vitamin D – 2X fewer deaths with just 30 ng -meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/more-survive-breast-cancer-if-more-vitamin-d-2x-fewer-deaths-with-just-30-ng-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/more-survive-breast-cancer-if-more-vitamin-d-2x-fewer-deaths-with-just-30-ng-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="meta-analysis-of-vitamin-d-sufficiency-for-improving-survival-of-patients-with-breast-cancer">Meta-analysis of Vitamin D Sufficiency for Improving Survival of Patients with Breast Cancer&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Melanin provides a crucial filter for solar UV radiation and its genetically determined variation influences both skin pigmentation and risk of cancer. Genetic evidence suggests that the acquisition of a highly stable melanocortin 1 receptor allele promoting black pigmentation arose around the time of savannah colonization by hominins at some 1-2 Ma. The adaptive significance of dark skin is generallybelievedtobeprotectionfromUVdamagebut thepathologies that might have had a deleterious impact on survival and/or reproductive fitness, though much debated, are uncertain. Here, I suggest that data on age-associated cancer incidence and lethality in albinos living at low latitudes in both Africa and Central America support the contention that skin cancer could have provided a potent selective force for the emergence of black skin in early hominins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diabetes, hyperglycemia, depression, poor balance, etc associated with less than 20 ng of vitamin D in seniors</title><link>/posts/diabetes-hyperglycemia-depression-poor-balance-etc-associated-with-less-than-20--in-d-in-seniors.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/diabetes-hyperglycemia-depression-poor-balance-etc-associated-with-less-than-20--in-d-in-seniors.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="associations-between-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-concentrations-and-multiple-health-conditions-physical-performance-measures-disability-and-all-cause-mortality-the-concord-health-and-ageing-in-men-project">Associations Between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations and Multiple Health Conditions, Physical Performance Measures, Disability, and All-Cause Mortality: The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Previous studies suggest that circulating 25(OH)D may favorably influence cardiorespiratory fitness and fat oxidation. However, these relationships have not been examined in older adult women of different ethnic groups. The objectives of this study were to determine whether serum 25(OH)D is related to cardiovascular fitness (VO2max) in sedentary women ages ≥60 years and to determine whether these associations differ between African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA). A secondary aim was to determine whether serum 25(OH)D is correlated with respiratory quotient (RQ) during submaximal exercise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>96 percent vitamin D deficient – destitute asylum seekers and refugees in London</title><link>/posts/96-percent-vitamin-d-deficient-destitute-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-in-london.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/96-percent-vitamin-d-deficient-destitute-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-in-london.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-specialist-clinic-for-destitute-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-in-london">A specialist clinic for destitute asylum seekers and refugees in London&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Decoding the genetics of an increased risk of complex diseases such as Autoimmune Diseases (ADs) and/or cancers associated with the aging process remains challenging. The controversies exist for the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on these diseases &lt;sup>[1,2]&lt;/sup>. However, based on comparative advantages of different model systems and recent ChIP-seq/ChIP-chip studies, we distilled out one novel testable hypothesis as follows: the genetic regulatory network of vitamin D receptor (VDR, the homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans DAF-12) may play a central role as a common basis preventing some autoimmune diseases and associated cancers &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>. Further, as a capacitor, DAF-12/VDR may buffer polygenic genetic mutations and/ or variations. The highly-conserved targets (e.g. MMP3) of DAF-12/ VDR may have synergic functions with its other evolutionarily-&amp;ldquo;fresh&amp;rdquo; targets (e.g. IL-6). Being consistent with the &amp;ldquo;hygiene hypothesis&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;danger signals&amp;rdquo; theory, some VDR/DAF-12 targets may be involved in these processes. In nature, the reversal of diseased status with vitamin D supplementation could be more difficult and/or complex than the breakdown of robust health. Put aggregates, they may partially clarify the controversies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seniors with adequate vitamin D could rebalance themselves 80% faster, and thus not fall as often – 2013</title><link>/posts/seniors-with-adequate-vitamin-d-could-rebalance-themselves-80-percent-faster-and-l-as-often-2013.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/seniors-with-adequate-vitamin-d-could-rebalance-themselves-80-percent-faster-and-l-as-often-2013.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The negative association of the latitude where people live and the incidence of non cutaneous cancer in that population in North America have been demonstrated in many studies for many types of cancer. Since the intensity of UVB exposure decreases with increasing latitude, and UVB exposure provides the mechanism for vitamin D production in the skin, the hypothesis that increased vitamin D provides protection against the development of cancer has been proposed. This hypothesis has been tested in a substantial number of prospective and case control studies and in a few randomized clinical trials (RTC) assessing whether either vitamin D intake or serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) correlate (inversely) with cancer development. Most of the studies have focused on colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. The results have been mixed. The most compelling data for a beneficial relationship between vitamin D intake or serum 25OHD levels and cancer have been obtained for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D: calcium and bone homeostasis during evolution</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-calcium-and-bone-homeostasis-during-evolution.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-calcium-and-bone-homeostasis-during-evolution.html</guid><description>&lt;p>BoneKEy Reports 3, Article number: 480 (2014) | doi:10.1038/bonekey.2013.214&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D3 is already found early in the evolution of life but essentially as inactive end products of the photochemical reaction of 7-dehydrocholestol with ultraviolet light B. A full vitamin D (refers to vitamin D2 and D3) endocrine system, characterized by a specific VDR (vitamin D receptor, member of the nuclear receptor family), specific vitamin D metabolizing CYP450 enzymes regulated by calciotropic hormones and a dedicated plasma transport-protein is only found in vertebrates. In the earliest vertebrates (lamprey), vitamin D metabolism and VDR may well have originated from a duplication of a common PRX/VDR ancestor gene as part of a xenobiotic detoxification pathway. The vitamin D endocrine system, however, subsequently became an important regulator of calcium supply for an extensive calcified skeleton. Vitamin D is essential for normal calcium and bone homeostasis as shown by rickets in vitamin D-deficient growing amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. From amphibians onward, bone is gradually more dynamic with regulated bone resorption, mainly by combined action of PTH and 1 a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on the generation and function of multinucleated osteoclasts. Therefore, bone functions as a large internal calcium reservoir, under the control of osteoclasts. Osteocytes also display a remarkable spectrum of activities, including mechanical sensing and regulating mineral homeostasis, but also have an important role in global nutritional and energy homeostasis. Mineralization from reptiles onward is under the control of well-regulated SIBLING proteins and associated enzymes, nearly all under the control of 1,25(OH)2D3. The vitamin D story thus started as inert molecule but gained an essential role for calcium and bone homeostasis in terrestrial animals to cope with the challenge of higher gravity and calcium-poor environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is Vitamin D’s “Moment in the Sun” Behind Us (nope)</title><link>/posts/is-vitamin-ds-moment-in-the-sun-behind-us-nope.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/is-vitamin-ds-moment-in-the-sun-behind-us-nope.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Chest. 2014;145(1):5-6. doi:10.1378/chest.13-2049&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Abstract: Observational and ecological studies are generally used to determine the presence of effect of cancer risk-modifying factors. Researchers generally agree that environmental factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and low serum 25-hdyroxyvitamin D levels are important cancer risk factors. This ecological study used age-adjusted incidence rates for 21 cancers for 157 countries (87 with high-quality data) in 2008 with respect to dietary supply and other factors, including per capita gross domestic product, life expectancy, lung cancer incidence rate (an index for smoking), and latitude (an index for solar ultraviolet-B doses). The factors found to correlate strongly with multiple types of cancer were lung cancer (direct correlation with 12 types of cancer), energy derived from animal products (direct correlation with 12 types of cancer, inverse with two), latitude (direct correlation with six types, inverse correlation with three), and per capita gross national product (five types). Life expectancy and sweeteners directly correlated with three cancers, animal fat with two, and alcohol with one. Consumption of animal products correlated with cancer incidence with a lag time of 15-25 years. Types of cancer which correlated strongly with animal product consumption, tended to correlate weakly with latitude; this occurred for 11 cancers for the entire set of countries. Regression results were somewhat different for the 87 high-quality country data set and the 157-country set. Single-country ecological studies have inversely correlated nearly all of these cancers with solar ultraviolet-B doses. These results can provide guidance for prevention of cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Variety of non-skeletal vitamin D studies in special issue of Nutrients</title><link>/posts/variety-of-non-skeletal-vitamin-d-studies-in-special-issue-of-nutrients.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/variety-of-non-skeletal-vitamin-d-studies-in-special-issue-of-nutrients.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-and-human-health-celebrating-diversity">Vitamin D and Human Health: Celebrating Diversity&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This Special Issue of Nutrients: Vitamin D and Human Health celebrates diversity in vitamin D research with articles from bench-to-bedside, examining mechanisms, epidemiology, and clinical issues in the management of non-skeletal disease following themes set by an earlier review in Nutrients &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. Vitamin D became synonymous with calcium and bone metabolism originating from Casimir Funk&amp;rsquo;s concept of &amp;ldquo;Vitamines&amp;rdquo;. This suggests that vitamin D is an amine found in food with a single mode of action affecting calcium and bone metabolism &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>, whereas vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone derived from sunshine with a plethora of physiological functions (autocrine, paracrine, endocrine &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>, and epigenetic &lt;sup>[4]&lt;/sup>) associating vitamin D deficiency with many illnesses &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. Deficiency is pandemic and most prevalent where sun exposure is limited by culture climate and skin colour &lt;sup>[5]&lt;/sup>. Whilst reports have focused on diet and bone metabolism &lt;sup>[6]&lt;/sup>, this Special Issue of Nutrients about Vitamin D and Human Health focuses on non-skeletal disease, and research driven by industry and community health concerns.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D update for Nurse Practitioners</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-update-for-nurse-practitioners.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-update-for-nurse-practitioners.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Introduction: It has been suggested that vitamin D is effective to prevent mortality. However, there is no consistent conclusion that the effects of vitamin D supplementation on all-cause mortality are associated with duration of treatment.

&lt;p>Recent scientific studies now provide overwhelming proof that unequivocally confirms what many non-mainstream healthcare practitioners have long known and asserted: The regular intake of dairy and calcium supplementation promotes all known chronic degenerative diseases, and it significantly shortens life. All physicians and patients alike need to know the truth about calcium. Most people already have too much calcium in their tissues, and the incessant trumpeting of the purported health benefits of calcium supplementation and high-dairy diets must finally be exposed as marketing ploys only. The truth about calcium must finally be known.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D testing using smartphone camera: Prototype</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-testing-using-smartphone-camera-prototype.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-testing-using-smartphone-camera-prototype.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="nutriphone-hopes-to-commercialize-smartphone-enabled-vitamin-d-deficiency-testing">Nutriphone hopes to commercialize smartphone-enabled vitamin D deficiency testing&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The range of osteoporosis treatments is increasingly large and, like any disease, the pharmacological management of patients should involve a risk/benefit evaluation to attain the greatest reduction in risk of fracture with the lowest incidence of adverse events. The aim of this review is to critically appraise the literature about the safety issues of the main pharmacological treatments of osteoporosis. This document is the result of a consensus of experts based on a systematic review of regulatory documents, randomized controlled trials, metaanalyses, pharmacovigilance surveys and case series related to possible adverse drug reactions to osteoporosis treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplements, bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, selective estrogen receptor modulators, denosumab, and teriparatide. As expected, randomized controlled trials showed only the most common adverse events due to the samples size and the short observation time. Case series and observational studies are able to provide data about uncommon side effects, but in some cases a sure cause-effect relationship needs still to be confirmed. Consistently with methodological limitations, the newer drugs have a tolerance profile that has not been fully explored yet. Osteoporosis treatments showed an overall good tolerance profile with rare serious adverse events that, however, must be well known by the clinician who prescribes these drugs. The concern about possible adverse events should be weighed against the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with a significant fracture risk reduction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancer Survival is poor if vitamin D is less than 20ng (every study showed benefit)– review</title><link>/posts/cancer-survival-is-poor-if-vitamin-d-is-less-than-20ng-every-study-showed-benefit-review.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-survival-is-poor-if-vitamin-d-is-less-than-20ng-every-study-showed-benefit-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-inverse-relationship-between-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-cancer-survival-discussion-of-causation">The Inverse Relationship between 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Survival: Discussion of Causation&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Like vitamin D deficit, magnesium deficit is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several steps in the vitamin D metabolism, such as vitamin D binding to its transport protein and the conversion of vitamin D into the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by hepatic and renal hydroxylation, depend on magnesium as a cofactor. A new analysis of two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data sets, published in BMC Medicine, investigated potential interactions between magnesium intake, circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is the generally accepted indicator of vitamin D status, and mortality. Data indicate a reduced risk of insufficient/deficient vitamin D status at high magnesium intake and an inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and mortality, particularly cardiovascular mortality, among those with magnesium intake above the median. The study provides important findings concerning potential metabolic interactions between magnesium and vitamin D and its clinical relevance. However, results should be considered preliminary since biochemical data on individual magnesium status were lacking, confounding cannot be excluded and questions on the dose?response relationship still remain to be answered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Those with HIV who doubled their vitamin D levels reduced their chance of death by 47 percent</title><link>/posts/those-with-hiv-who-doubled-their-vitamin-d-levels-reduced-their-chance-of-death-by-47-percent.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/those-with-hiv-who-doubled-their-vitamin-d-levels-reduced-their-chance-of-death-by-47-percent.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="paper-was-published-later">Paper was published later&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>There is current interest in increasing human vitamin D dietary intake without having to modify human eating habits. One method to increase human dietary vitamin D intake is to generate eggs with increased concentrations of vitamin D through high-concentration vitamin D feeding in the diets of laying hens. Although eggs can be produced with high concentrations of vitamin D, the consequences of these diets on hen performance and egg quality have not been validated. The objective of this research is to quantify the effects of high concentrations of cholecalciferol (D3) on laying hen performance and egg quality.

 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>My guest today is Henry Lahore. He runs the website called VitaminDWiki.com where you can find tons of information on Vitamin D. I actually came across this site when I was looking for some information on Vitamin D and ended up buying one of the Vitamin D bulbs you recommended. So Henry, thanks so much for being part of the show.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Sure. Great.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So how did you … Tell me a little bit about your background? How did you get interested in the importance of Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I’ve been interested in the importance of various supplements and healthy living for most of my life and have enjoyed sharing information with lots of people on all sorts of topics. About 4 years ago, a friend got me interested in Vitamin D after he found that his back pain went away really suddenly after taking extra Vitamin D. So I started exploring that and about a month into it, I came up with as I’ve done for many other things 10 questions for myself is to what is this about Vitamin D? &lt;br>What things does it really help with? &lt;br>What things does it sort of help with? &lt;br>What does it treat? &lt;br>What does it prevent? &lt;br>What is its toxic level? &lt;br>So anyway I had 10 questions that you could see under &lt;a href="https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/AboutUs">About US&lt;/a> at the Vitamin D website. I answered all of those myself and continued on – about 6,000 hours into gathering Vitamin D information. It’s been very nice in helping people around the world with Vitamin D.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So what are some of the more important things that you’ve learned? I mean, the main thing that I think about with Vitamin D is the health for your bones but there is a ton of other things on your website. What are some of the big ones?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>You can put them into 2 different categories for your listeners. There’s … One category is in terms of sports and general health. The other category is avoiding major kinds of diseases that people get later in their 40’s, 50’s, 60’s, but so kind of 2 categories. Let’s talk about the health benefits from a sports point of view or feeling healthy when you’re in your 30’s and 40’s or 20’s. There are lots of things there under the … Of the 5,000 or so studies that I have on the website; I’ve categorized many of them into about 160 different categories. One of which is sports. So if you go to overview on sports and Vitamin D, you can see what the benefits are there for the person – I am going there right now.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>One of the things that you e-mailed me about was this idea that you really need to get out in the sun during the middle of the day, between 10 and 3 PM if you want to get any Vitamin D on your skin. You even showed me a link to some &lt;strong>tan-through shirts&lt;/strong> , which I thought were pretty cool. How does that work and how much time do we actually need to spend in the sun to get adequate Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. So let’s talk about it from that point of view, in terms of how does a person who is a runner for instance, your particular clientele, get more Vitamin D. Actually, you get … Probably an adequate amount of Vitamin D if you can run in the … Sort of the noontime area in this sunny day in the summer part of your world. That’s just fine. You probably don’t need any more Vitamin D. However, it’s for the other people who, maybe it’s too hot in their climate to run in the middle of the day and so they have to run way in the morning or way in the evening. I went down to Singapore for instance 2 years ago. I saw lots of runners at 6AM but they kind have went away by 7AM because it’s too hot. So they weren’t getting much Vitamin D, anyway, likewise if cloudy day and such.&lt;br>So ways of adding Vitamin D for one simple way that I checked, I’m suspecting as much and you have to check that out. You can buy the tan-through shirt. There’s 2 different companies selling it. You can find out about it on the &lt;a href="/posts/website" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4293">website&lt;/a>. It reduces the amount of Vitamin D by about a factor of 2 from what you would get if you are nude above the shirt, above the waist. That gives a significant amount of extra Vitamin D for people who might not feel comfortable being shirtless while jogging along.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So what are some of the benefits that you’ve personally seen since trying to increase your Vitamin D and do you do that mainly through supplementation?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>

 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>&lt;a href="/posts/as-youll-see-on-the-website" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 747">As you’ll see on the website&lt;/a>, I consider the sun as being the best source. UV is being the second best source and supplementation is the third source but the supplement -&lt;br> you get a little bit better advantages, the higher up you can go on that curve, but straight supplementation provides a lot of advantages. So I get my sun … When it’s sunny, I live in Seattle. It’s kind of cloudy much of the time, so I get the sun during the summer in addition to having UV and in addition to having the supplementation from the supplements I take.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So you mentioned there that the sun is probably the best way to get Vitamin D. What kind of research have you come across that would indicate that? Why is the sun any better?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Don’t really know quite why it’s better. I guess in general, from like your Paleo site, the more whole foods you get, the better it is and they can’t quite figure out why that’s the case. They’ve seen that you get a particular B supplement or E supplement or such. That’s pretty good but not quite as good as getting it from the food. Well, that turns out to be the case for the sun as well. There are various problems that can be greatly avoided: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and a few other odds ends. They’re finding … Like for instance for multiple sclerosis that you significantly decrease … I guess significant better impact to the body or benefit to the body by getting your Vitamin D levels in your blood up to the same level. &lt;br>You get a much better benefit if that Vitamin D came from the sun or UV than if it came from a supplement. The science is. . . I’ll probably give it they may get it down pat from about 5 years from now – as to why that is, but that’s how it is right now.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned how that’s …&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Go ahead.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I was just going to say, you mentioned how that’s similar to the Paleo Diet and I think that is true is … We’ve evolved for a long time living in a more ancestral environment where we are outdoors a lot and I think science, in 100 years from now is probably going to look back and they’ll have the reasons for why the more natural living is better, but now, a huge amount of data shows that trying to live a more natural habitat is probably the way to go.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes, and I agree with that. I don’t know. I can’t point to a specific study that says so, but there’s more and more hints that way. Along those lines. So I’ve got various people that come to me and say, “Well, I don’t take any supplements. I couldn’t get everything I need from food.” And well, that used to be correct up until about 100 years ago. But now, there’s … If you look at the amount of Vitamin D content in food, I’d say 100 years ago, an apple pie would have 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D in a slice of apple pie. Because the pigs that made the lard to make the apple pie with were outdoors and their fat have 500 IUs of Vitamin D per tablespoon.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So if you’ve worked through the numbers, that’s how it worked … That’s how you got the extra Vitamin D. That’s one example. Likewise, the bacon, likewise, chicken eggs that used to have 4 times as much Vitamin D as it does now when the … Well, chickens indoors, pigs indoors, etc., they’re not getting their Vitamin D.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So what … I actually went ahead and bought &lt;a href="/posts/one-of-these-vitamin-d-lamps" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 3154">one of these Vitamin D lamps&lt;/a>. It’s called the Sperti Vitamin D lamp. On your website, you have a lot of different products, not that you sell but just that you kind of described that could be helpful to people. What are some of the things that you found … I know I saw some of the lamps, you can buy on Amazon for $15 or $20 that are UV lamps? Are those going to be just as effective or how can you use those?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Not nearly … There are a little bit effective … &lt;a href="/posts/i-actually-bought-i-think-4-or-5-different-ones" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 982">I actually bought I think 4 or 5 different ones&lt;/a> myself to give it a try. I’ve got a UV meter that looks at the exact amount of light that’s coming out of it and some of the … I have on the website what the company says is the amount of UV coming out. It’s pretty good. It’s correct. Some other companies don’t say how much is coming out so I just measured it myself.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. What did you find?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It’s basically the more you pay for it, the more UV you get.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Down with the $10, $15 level, you get some UV, which works out to … Some of those by the way, the really little cost ones are under of $25, $30 are designed for reptiles.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Right.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The reptiles and many other animals really need to have UV and if you have a pet reptile, it will die off or have a poor life or look really lousy after a couple of years of not being out in the sun. That actually happens with lots of birds, too but … So they found that by putting a little compact fluorescent bulb that puts out a little bit of UV that really perks up the reptile, they feel a lot better and have baby ones, etc. But the amount of UV that comes out through that is not very cost-effective or worthwhile for human use. You could have a little UV light like that and provided you’re wearing glasses so that the UV doesn’t get into your eyes but just gets to your body. &lt;br>Let’s say you’re semi-nude in front of the lamp, you have to spend … I’m just guessing . . . 2 hours a day to get a minimal amount that you can get for a 2-cent worth of Vitamin D supplement. So it’s not, not very … If you look at the cost of your time for doing something when we’re talking pennies for hour, most people time is worth more than pennies per hour.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Right. Right.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The brand you bought was a pretty pricey one. It’s got a fair amount of output and it’s pretty well but that was beyond my spare of change level. I guess that’s why I came up with was not spare-change either. Anyway, at $150 level, I installed it next to my bathroom and I use it while I’m brushing my teeth or shaving and such and it puts up about 500 … It gives you about 500 IUs in 5 minutes, which is okay. It’s not great but it’s nice so I use that.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Why are you using that? Are you having to wear protective eyewear?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No. As it turns out, all you want to do is just make sure that the light doesn’t get directly to your eyes. If you’re just wearing regular glasses, 99.9% of all glasses stop UV even if it says that it’s … Even if It doesn’t mention it, the glasses really do, they have to go out of their way to not stop UVB.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay. Well you know, I really like it in the sun and since I’ve started a more … A Paleo diet and learning more about the importance of Vitamin D, I’ve been getting more sun on my skin but what about people who say, you really got to be careful. You shouldn’t … You should always wear sunscreen when you go outside. &lt;strong>Is there a risk of cancer?&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>There is a … There’s a risk, as you probably aware from lots of things. If you overdo anything, there is a problem to your body. If you drink too much water every day, there’s a problem to your body. If you have too much salt, if you have too much sun, if you have too much of anything, there is a problem. So the Australians for instance, the people who are the most for having sunscreen, they’ve finally come around to saying, “No, doggonit.” Probably if you’re outdoors, that’s going to vary with exactly where you are but if … You could probably look at it in terms of how hot it feels. If it’s not really hot, that is to say, over 80 or 90 degrees, then you can probably be outside, just fine, no problems of cancer at all for like 15 minutes to half an hour provided you’re getting used to it.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The problems that people have with cancer or with your skin having difficulties in burning and other odds and ends often come when they do it too suddenly. That is to say, they’re indoors all the season and all of a sudden, OKAY. Let’s go out and be outdoors for 4 hours or 6 hours very first time for the season. Woa, you run into problems with that. My dad, as an example, was a carpenter and he never suntanned, he never sunburned, and yet he was out every day. So it’s that gradualness. So if you have a person who … Okay, let’s say a runner who has not been running for a while or has been indoors for a while then all of a sudden decides in … For the Northern part of the world, decides in May … Okay. I’m going to go out and jog or be outdoors for 2 or 3 hours, no, that’s a little incorrect in the Southern part of the United States. You could be out there for a while but you had better put the sunscreen on. By the way, just a little subset of this, it turns out that if you have enough Vitamin D in your body, whether it’s coming from the sun or from supplements, you don’t burn nearly as much. That’s one of the small inconsequential benefits or hardly noted benefits that I have for Vitamin D over the last 3 years that I’ve had a lot of it. I haven’t burned once. In fact, I went for a bicycle ride. I was kind of trying this out in a very sunny climate in May this year. I bicycled such that the sun was on one side of me only for 2 ½ hours right at noon time and I felt like I was going to be getting … It reminded me of having going to be getting a &lt;strong>bad sunburn&lt;/strong> from that I had for many years. At the end of the day, nothing. The next day, I couldn’t tell the difference of the sun tanning on one leg versus the other. The other leg was essentially in the shadow from not being seeing the sun at all. That’s how it is with bicycling because you only go on one direction oftentimes.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Right. Right. Interesting. Now, I had a lady on the podcast a few weeks ago. Her name was Stephanie Seneff and she wasn’t quite sure about this but she thought that perhaps Vitamin D supplementation might actually in some way trick the body in that it’s providing you with Vitamin D as a marker in your blood but whether it was really having the same benefits as the sun. You seem to say the same thing. Would you agree with that sentiment?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I’ve read a little bit about her stuff. I’m not in complete agreement. I find it very intriguing what she says. I guess I agree in terms of what I stated a little bit ago that I believe the sun is better than UV, which is better than Vitamin D. Then the other part, I often say, is if you’re going to take only a single supplement, it should be Vitamin D.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I use quite a variety, like about 30 different supplements in different amounts and &amp;hellip; But Vitamin D has taken the place of virtually all of those. I’m feeling far better than I used to by taking a whole, witches brew of various supplements.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>How old are you, Henry?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>About 69.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay and before we started recording, Henry actually told me that he’s still biking around 100 miles a week and he used to run upwards of 100 miles a week. So he’s staying in very good shape and do you think that the Vitamin D that you’re supplementing with or getting from the sun has helped with your &lt;strong>longevity&lt;/strong> as far as exercise?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, absolutely. In fact, my wife has stated quite easily that … Quite often that she feels she’s 10 years younger because of taking Vitamin D. I know for myself, I used to have at my age lots of little aches and pains and my heels would be cracking and I’d have to put heel cream on it all the time, all the time like 20 times a year especially in the winter. I’d get a little bit of creakiness getting out of bed and have to pull myself up out of bed holding on to the piece of furniture there. And getting little aches and pains in my … Anyway, just feeling older, okay? I no longer feel older. I feel like I’m in my 40’s maybe instead of my … end of my 60’s.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Wow. Wow and has there been other changes in your life that could have helped you feel younger or has Vitamin D been the main change?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Vitamin D has been the main change. I’ve done a couple of other things, &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/categories/omega-3">Omega 3&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> I’ve been having … I’ve been doing that for about 6 or 8 years now and it’s quite good. I’ve been adding &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/categories/magnesium">Magnesium&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> recently. By the way, I studied through and have probably looked at 200, 300 different studies concerning the &lt;a href="/posts/cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270"> &lt;strong>cofactors&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> to go along with Vitamin D and I’m taking all of the necessary cofactors with Vitamin D. I’ve got on there as to how you can increase the benefit, the response in your body to the Vitamin D, which you actually get, &lt;a href="/posts/by-a-factor-of-two" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1918"> &lt;strong>by a factor of two&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> by doing the various things, such that I now have the quite high Vitamin D level that most people would consider to be excessive, but I don’t consider to be excessive. &lt;br>That just reminds me of the little note, &lt;strong>how much Vitamin D should you have&lt;/strong> . There’s various recommendations as to the number of nanograms per milliliter that you should have. Some places around the world have this … They say 10 nanograms is enough! The United States says 20 nanograms is enough! A great number of scientists who have looked at this say: &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/posts/somewhere-between-30-and-100-nanograms-is-good" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2028">somewhere between 30 and 100 nanograms is good&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> ].&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The … Looks as though the optimum level is somewhere between 40 and 80 nanograms for most people. In fact, I’m putting together a video on Vitamin D and will be stating that as being the optimum level to have that you wish that you should have at least 40 nanograms. There’s some people down in Brazil . . a doctor down there who’s been treating people, &lt;a href="/posts/treating-people-with-multiple-sclerosis" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4608">treating people with &lt;strong>multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> and reversing and sometimes completely eliminating the multiple sclerosis and he gets his people up to 150 nanograms of Vitamin D. So that’s for treating.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I happen to be about 120.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh wow. Now, you mentioned a few … Some co-factors that you’re taking along to increase your Vitamin D by as much as 100% or 200%.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>By 100, … It’s doubling the Vitamin D in your body by … In fact; I’ve got the numbers there if you’re going through the co-factors. Little costs and the co-factor section on the Wiki as to … There’s about 5 things you can do. Some of which are the co-factors in terms of &lt;a href="/categories/magnesium">Magnesium&lt;/a>. If you get enough Magnesium in your body, it increases the benefits &lt;span>[response]&lt;/span>, the Vitamin D level in your blood stream by about 30%.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>What kind of Magnesium, because I know there’s a slow releasing Magnesium and then there’s just a regular sort of Magnesium. Do you prefer either one? Does it matter?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Actually, I’ve looked at about 10 different ones. I personally tried 6 different ones. It turns out, Magnesium is a strange critter. Many people, most people have problems with having too much Magnesium in terms of bowel problems or diarrhea. Given that, there’s still … There are some Magnesium types that are much better, have much less of that problem. Magnesium Chloride liquid is quite an inexpensive way of … that most people don’t seem to have any problem with at all. There’s another kind of Magnesium, which I’ve seen recently called Pico Magnesium in which they claim, but I’ve not seen any documentation on, that it has zero problems for people in terms of difficulties, intestinal difficulties. &lt;br>I bought that, I didn’t notice any difference myself so I’m back to the other stuff, which is 1/3 of the price.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So over-the-counter Magnesium that you can pick up off the shelf will be good enough is what you’re saying.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It appears as though over the counter stuff … If your body and your digestive system can handle it, should be just fine. There’s maybe a difference of 50% between the effectivity of the Magnesium element in your body, the bioavailability of the Magnesium element in your body, between the various Magnesium Citric, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Oxide, etc. etc. Let your body be the judge of that. To keep it very simple I have for the summary for the co-factors provided in the … I’d say &lt;strong>500 Calcium, 500 Magnesium.&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So for most people, that’s reducing the amount of Calcium down to about 500 and increasing their Magnesium up to 500. &lt;span>[milligrams of the element in each case]&lt;/span>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay and are those the two important co-factors to take to increase your Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. The Calcium is not … Changing the amount of Calcium will not affect the response level in your body but it will make things a little bit … Get extra Calcium in your arteries and things of that sort.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So there are … The co-factors get involved in some not directly in what happens in your bloodstream but happens elsewhere in your body.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Are there any other things that … Are those the two main ones or are there other things, too?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I think the two others to be concerned about … Again, don’t deal with what happens to the Vitamin D level in your body but are good to have anyway is &lt;a href="/posts/vitamin-k2" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 765"> &lt;strong>Vitamin K2&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> and also Omega 3.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Do you take those as supplements or do you get those through food?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Both of those I get through supplements.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay. Now, you mentioned that you might want to decrease your Calcium that you take in. So if you’re taking say 3 glasses of milk a day, plus Vitamin D, that might be too much milk.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No, that’s not too much milk. No. Nope. Three glasses is not that much Calcium actually.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Also, what turns out to be Calcium in milk is not super bio available anyway. Some people are taking 2 grams or 3 grams a day of Calcium supplements with the idea that’s going to help their bones and we all got to be careful of that because as you increase your Vitamin D, it increases the bioavailability of the &lt;a href="/categories/calcium">Calcium&lt;/a>. So equivalently, if they’re taking 2 grams of Calcium and then add on some good amount of Vitamin D, that’s equivalent to taking maybe 9 or 10 or 12 grams of Calcium which gets to be a bit of an overload for the body.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Well, let’s talk a little bit about dosage. How much does that … Do you just have to go to your doctor and get your blood checked or is there some general dosing that you would recommend taking as far as Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>What I’m generally recommending for virtually anyone in … Who doesn’t get much direct sun on kind of a daily basis year-round. Most of the people on earth is about 4,000 IUs of Vitamin D, which is the current upper limit as to what you … What people are allowed to have in the United States without asking your doctor.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay and if you’re going outside say for 30-minute run, would that count towards your 4,000 IUs?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, yeah. Definitely. Depending on how you’re dressed and what time of day and time of year, etc. that you’re going for a nice run in the middle of the day could give you 200 IUs, could give you maybe 2,000 IUs.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>If you were a white person and not overweight, which tends to be the case, and not a senior … &lt;a href="/posts/seniors-by-the-way-get-14-amount-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 28">Seniors by-the-way get ¼ amount of Vitamin D&lt;/a> from the sun as … So I for instance get ¼ of benefit of Vitamin D than I used to when I was aged 30.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It turns out that the skin of virtually everyone on earth decreases the amount of Vitamin D, which is generated from, as you get older and older. So I’m up about ¼ of the level I used to get.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. How about people with &lt;a href="/categories/darker-skin">darker skin&lt;/a>? What do they need to think about?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>If they kind of think that they’ve got a permanent sunscreen on, that’s a good way of looking at it. Such that I think I saw … I remember recently that … Well, it varies with approximately 4 times longer for a person with very dark skin to get the same amount of Vitamin D than a person who’s light skinned.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. So it would probably be more important to supplement for those people.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes, it would be … I think …&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I don’t mean to say those people, what I meant to say is it’s probably more if you have darker skin, it’s more important to supplement.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes. Well, it becomes more important. IF they have a lifestyle, that’s either construction worker or something else such that they’re outdoors all the time, okay, fine. They don’t have to supplement.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>That’s … But no fair being a construction worker in Northern Alaska, they have to get some amount of sun anyway.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. How about animals, if we have pets?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes. They tremendously like … Okay, talk about animals. The very first web page I made on Vitamin D was concerning &lt;a href="/posts/veterinaries-and-animals" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 17">veterinaries and animals&lt;/a>. &lt;br> It turns out that the vets learned a good decade ago that … hey - US government recommends a certain amount of Vitamin D for various animals, for cows, pigs, cats, dogs, etc. and the vets learned well over a decade ago that they get paid by keeping their patients, if you will, healthy. &lt;br>They are noticing that the amount of Vitamin D that the US government was recommending weren’t keeping their patients, cows, cats, dogs, etc. healthy. So they’ve now in general gone to 3 times the level of Vitamin D than is recommended by the US government. &lt;br>Now their animals are healthy, at least they stay alive long enough before they get killed or eaten. So I consider them advance warning as to things which are working out nicely. &lt;br>Back on cats and dogs, I’ve gotten various people around the globe who have contacted me and then tried giving their say aging dog, one was 17 years old, and it was getting kind of arthritic and kind of slow, etc. then wow, he got onto the fight of taking the Vitamin D. You figure it out per pound basis versus per kilogram basis as to how much to give to them. It was … He described it as being really giving a second life to the dog and so he lasted another 3 years. So, well into the dog years.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. Yeah. Henry, I found your website very interesting and you have it really nicely organized by different subjects. &lt;br>Aside from Vitamin D, it seems like you’re interested in a lot of health topics. Are there any other things that you’ve been looking into that my listeners might be interested in?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. I’ve been looking at health topics for about 40 years. A little hard to summarize briefly.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>Would Vitamin D be the biggest thing that you’ve come across?&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Absolutely. That’s why I was saying … I say quite often that &lt;strong>if you’re going to take only a single supplement, it should be Vitamin D&lt;/strong> . There’s few other odds and ends as we’ve mentioned in this podcast that are quite useful, but … And I take a miscellaneous of their small oddments, D-Ribose for example, for restoring energy, but I don’t … &lt;br> &lt;strong>D-Ribose&lt;/strong> doesn’t give me nearly the boost that used to before I was taking Vitamin D. It’s a neat thing for … I used to do quite often after going for a long, strenuous jog, it kind of tired out. Now, okay … &lt;br>Not addressing your question directly but it’s another benefit I finally found for myself. I live in a recreational vehicle now. I travel all around the United States and I used to go off to an exercise place every-other-day to get my exercise and go out do the workout but I knew I wasn’t able to do that when I was going RV-ing because they’re just not available. I’ve ended up going to about 90 different ones throughout the United States as a day pass. So I now have a thing that I learned about 12 years ago called &lt;strong>Strength Training&lt;/strong> that it really … Put it very quickly, you do that maximum amount of output you can do in about a 2-minute period on any one of the exercises. Then you just force yourself to exhaustion on that particular thing and you go on to the next one. &lt;br>Then you do that same thing again in 2 days, same thing again in 2 days and then later on, you’re getting a little bit used to that then you do it, say in every 3 days and 4 days. Well anyway, I’m now about once every 3 weeks for doing that kind of thing. I was still finding myself being … Going to maximum output on about 30 different muscle sets or groups that I’d feel really tired that same day and the next day, it gets kind of wiped out. I said, okay, this is good for my health. &lt;strong>I’m no longer tired out.&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Is that from doing it every 3 weeks, you’re saying? You’re giving your body more recovery or what’s going on there?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No, it was a night and day thing for me that up until about 4 years ago when I started taking the Vitamin D, I would be very tired after doing that once every 3-week thing. I’ve been into that every 3 weeks now for about 10 years. So it’s a kind of a constant for me. I’d be very tired when I take that D-Ribose and it would help some but I’d still be kind of wiped out but I allowed that was, okay it’s good for me overall. &lt;strong>Since taking the Vitamin D, I’m no longer tired immediately afterwards or the next day.&lt;/strong> The next day, I don’t even notice it. So overall, it greatly benefits. I would expect, anticipate a majority of your listeners who are okay for myself, it used to be in my 30’s that’s when I’d go for a long jog, long for me, I will say is 1 ½ hour. I’d go for a long jog, I feel very tired at the end of the day. The next day, I’d kind of recuperating and kind of a week later, I’m all back to normal. Same kind I think for a marathon except a little bit longer for recovery. I don’t think I’d be doing that right now. I suspect a majority of your runners will find that the … When they get their Vitamin D level up, that they will be much better. You’ll see under the &lt;a href="/posts/sports-and-vitamin-d-review" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1259">Sports and Vitamin D review&lt;/a> that I have that …&lt;br> Here, I’ll just quickly list some of the documented benefits of them seen by athletes around the world with Vitamin D, &lt;br>faster reaction time,&lt;br> far fewer colds and flus in the winter, %%less sore and tired after a workout like we just talked about. &lt;br>Fewer micro cracks and broken bones, &lt;br>bones which heal far more quickly than if they do get broken. &lt;br> Increased VO2 and exercise endurance, &lt;br>anyway, so we now have professional athletes around the world giving this a try. There’s one group that’s … Hockey players for instance, this is particularly good for indoor athletes, the hockey players, which kind of almost indoor by definition. There is a group in Chicago that had been doing lousy for the last 60 years. They got … &lt;strong>Took 5,000 IUs&lt;/strong> for every one of the players and then they &lt;a href="/posts/won-the-championship-for-their-league-the-next-year" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 293">won the championship for their league the next year&lt;/a>. So, complete reversal, things like that. Olympic athletes have been on the sly using either UV or Vitamin D since the 1930’s from different countries. Germany and Russia had learned about that, kept that kind of a state secret for a good 30 years but that was one of the reasons that they were doing pretty well.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Is there any danger to overdosing if … You recommend around 4,000 International Units a day.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yup.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I’ve seen some of the … Those you can buy at the store come in as much as like 10,000 a day. Would you want to avoid that much?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, no. No. I actually myself on average take 12,000 a day.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>4,000 is about the upper limit you should do without just arbitrarily unless you … More than 4,000 and you do that as a monotherapy. That is to say, the only thing you’re adding, you’re kind of unbalancing your body. You have to be taking those other co-factors. So when people take the idea and listen to this podcast, they say, “Oh, 4000 and okay, that’s fine.” If that’s the only takeaway point they have from this, I’d like to say, it’s 4,000. &lt;br>	If they’re more careful about adding one of those other factors and listing for their body, what’s going on and then you can bring it up much higher than that. That person down in Brazil that’s dealing with multiple sclerosis, he has these patients on between 20,000 and 140,000 per day. He is watching their Calcium and a few other odds and ends about that and getting this really excellent benefit.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Wow. I want to go back to something you mentioned about your weight training. You said you only do it once every 3 weeks, what’s … Is that … Do you maintain the same benefits as doing it every 2 days or every 4 days or is that just what works into your lifestyle? Why do you do it every 3 weeks?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It turns out, I tried doing it every 4 weeks and that wasn’t quite &lt;span>[often]&lt;/span> enough. So I started to degrade in terms of the strength of the muscles. On average, each of the different exercises that I do of leg pushes and pull downs and well, the various fairly standard exercises, on average, I had started … When I started off, I was at a certain level and I’m now about trippled in terms of the amount of weight that I can push and do and endure. I kind of maxed out at that but apparently, if you really workout, you can do even more than 3, but 3 times level is just fine for me. I guess at a particular place I go, I’m at the maximum amount of weight plates that you can use for those particular exercises on about half of them. &lt;br>So it’s inconvenient for me to go for more because I have to go scrounge around for extra weight plates to put it on there.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Well Henry, it’s been very interesting talking to you and I really appreciate all the work you’ve put into your website. I hope people listening to this will check it out. I’ll definitely put up a link to it. I just wanted to say thanks so much for coming on the show and taking your time today.&lt;/td>

&lt;p>Vitamin D has received tremendous amount of attention recently due to the ever-increasing reports of association between vitamin D deficiency and a wide range of conditions, from cancer to fertility to longevity. The fascination of disease association with vitamin D deficiency comes from the relatively easy solution to overcome such a risk factor, that is, either by increase in sun exposure and/or diet supplementation. Many reviews have been written on a protective role of vitamin D in asthma and related morbidities; here, we will summarize the epidemiological evidence supporting a role of vitamin D against hallmark features of severe asthma, such as airway remodeling and asthma exacerbations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ICU reduces Vitamin D levels, deregulates PTH</title><link>/posts/icu-reduces-vitamin-d-levels-deregulates-pth.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/icu-reduces-vitamin-d-levels-deregulates-pth.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="changes-in-the-calcium-parathyroid-hormone-vitamin-d-axis-and-prognosis-for-critically-ill-patients-a-prospective-observational-study">Changes in the Calcium-Parathyroid Hormone-Vitamin D Axis and Prognosis for Critically Ill Patients: A Prospective Observational Study&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Magnesium plays an essential role in the synthesis and metabolism of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation substantially reversed the resistance to vitamin D treatment in patients with magnesium-dependent vitamin-D-resistant rickets. We hypothesized that dietary magnesium alone, particularly its interaction with vitamin D intake, contributes to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, and the associations between serum 25(OH)D and risk of mortality may be modified by magnesium intake level.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prediabetics not helped by weekly vitamin D (perhaps D2) – RCT</title><link>/posts/prediabetics-not-helped-by-weekly-vitamin-d-perhaps-d2-rct.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/prediabetics-not-helped-by-weekly-vitamin-d-perhaps-d2-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="high-dose-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-people-with-prediabetes-and-hypovitaminosis-d">High-dose vitamin D supplementation in people with prediabetes and hypovitaminosis D.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>This article discusses one of the current most controversial nutrition topics. Recent vitamin D recommendations, as well as the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations and implications on health status are reviewed. The various functions of vitamin D, starting from the cellular level, through autoimmune diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neuromuscular processes, to its role in obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as in pregnancy outcomes, are also discussed. The most up-to-date literature published in peer-review scientific journals was reviewed. While the role of vitamin D in bone metabolism and the amount to support bone health is unequivocal, its benefits and/or roles in various other health conditions and the best way to achieve and maintain optimal levels are still controversial. Opinions vary on the recommended intake for vitamin D and what the desirable serum levels of vitamin D may be. Despite the numerous reports about its impact in autoimmune processes, several cancers, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pregnancy complications, the evidence is not robust enough to draw definite conclusions or to establish a causal relationship. Only the role of vitamin D in neuromuscular functions and prevention of falls in frail elderly seems to be more substantiated. Reaching the current or even higher levels of consumption (e.g. 1500-2000 IU/day) seems improbable by food and sun exposure only and supplementation should be in place, particularly for individuals at risk, including breast-fed infants, children, pregnant/lactating women, elderly, obese and individuals with fat mal absorption.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Huntington disease patients also have low levels of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/huntington-disease-patients-also-have-low-levels-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/huntington-disease-patients-also-have-low-levels-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="high-prevalence-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-insufficiency-in-patients-with-manifest-huntington-disease-an-explorative-study">High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in patients with manifest Huntington disease: An explorative study&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>HIV-infected individuals suffer from accelerated aging, which manifests as premature cardiovascular and bone disease. However, little is known of the association of these two disorders in the HIV population. Our objective was to investigate the association between a marker of atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcium &lt;span>[CAC]&lt;/span>) and low bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional cohort of HIV-infected patients. The study was conducted at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. A total of 636 consecutive middle-aged, HIV-infected subjects were recruited between January 2006 and December 2010. All patients underwent CAC and BMD assessment. Patients were categorized according to a CAC score &amp;lt;100 or &amp;gt;100 units based on previous literature that identified this cut-point as a marker of increased risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnesium and Vitamin D very synergistic</title><link>/posts/magnesium-and-vitamin-d-very-synergistic.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/magnesium-and-vitamin-d-very-synergistic.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="magnesium-vitamin-d-status-and-mortality-results-from-us-national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey-nhanes-2001-to-2006-and-nhanes-iii">Magnesium, vitamin D status and mortality: results from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001 to 2006 and NHANES III&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Vitamins and minerals are essential for growth and metabolism. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 2 billion people are deficient in key vitamins and minerals. Groups most vulnerable to these micronutrient deficiencies are pregnant and lactating women and young children, given their increased demands. Food fortification is one of the strategies that has been used safely and effectively to prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off Topic: EDTA similar reduction in heart attack as Vitamin C, aspirin and Mg – RCT</title><link>/posts/off-topic-edta-similar-reduction-in-heart-attack-as-vitamin-c-aspirin-and-mg-rct.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-edta-similar-reduction-in-heart-attack-as-vitamin-c-aspirin-and-mg-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-disodium-edta-chelation-regimen-on-cardiovascular-events-in-patients-with-previous-myocardial-infarction---the-tact-randomized-trial">Effect of Disodium EDTA Chelation Regimen on Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Previous Myocardial Infarction - The TACT Randomized Trial&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Geographic variations in mortality rate in the United States could be due to several hypothesized factors, one of which is exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Limited evidence from previous prospective studies has been inconclusive. The association between ambient residential UVR exposure and total and cause-specific mortality risks in a regionally diverse cohort (346,615 white, non-Hispanic subjects, 50–71 years of age, in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)–AARP Diet and Health Study) was assessed, with accounting for individual-level confounders. UVR exposure (averaged for 1978–1993 and 1996–2005) from NASA&amp;rsquo;s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer was linked to the US Census Bureau 2000 census tract of participants&amp;rsquo; baseline residence. Multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Over 12 years, UVR exposure was associated with total deaths (n = 41,425; hazard ratio for highest vs. lowest quartiles (HRQ4 vs. Q1) =&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney patients need some form vitamin D – the question is, which form</title><link>/posts/kidney-patients-need-some-form-vitamin-d-the-question-is-which-form.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-patients-need-some-form-vitamin-d-the-question-is-which-form.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="which-vitamin-d-in-ckd-mbd-the-time-of-burning-questions">Which Vitamin D in CKD-MBD?

&lt;p>Vitamins A and D are essential nutrients that play important roles in growth and development. Preterm and low birth weight infants have low levels of these nutrients and are at risk for developing detrimental health consequences associated with vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies. Preliminary data suggest that vitamin A and D supplementation is needed to prevent deficiency. More work is needed to define optimal doses, timing, and modes of administration to ensure that an adequate supply of these vitamins is available to meet the critical needs during pregnancy and in high-risk neonates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No association of cardiac surgery outcome with vitamin D level – they were all low</title><link>/posts/no-association-of-cardiac-surgery-outcome-with-vitamin-d-level-they-were-all-low.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-association-of-cardiac-surgery-outcome-with-vitamin-d-level-they-were-all-low.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="low-vitamin-d-concentration-is-not-associated-with-increased-mortality-and-morbidity-after-cardiac-surgery">Low vitamin d concentration is not associated with increased mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The growing attention to the role of vitamin D in skeletal and extra-skeletal diseases over the last decade, induced an increased demand for Vitamin D determination as well as a dramatic rise of sales of vitamin D supplement. However, several critical points in this field remain to be clarified. We lack a clear consensus about the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency. The identification of different thresholds defining vitamin D status have relevant implications in clinical practice. In fact, the worldwide prevalence of low vitamin D status is highly varying according to the level of 25(OH)D utilized to define sufficiency. Therefore, the assessment of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may have a critical role, but a number of different technical problems associated with its determination may interfere in interpreting the results. The hydrophobic nature of the vitamin D and the tight binding to its carrier (vitamin D binding protein, DBP), the different forms circulating in blood and the issue of standardisation are among the most important factors influencing the measurement of this metabolite. Another controversial point relies on the conflicting guidance on prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency endorsed by different medical and scientific communities. In particular, uncertainty exists about how to replete vitamin D stores, how to maintain normal 25(OH)D levels after repletion, which form of vitamin D is preferable for supplementation, which route of administration and dosing regimens are advisable. Finally, concerns have been raised regarding vitamin D toxicity and its adverse effects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More sunlight (more vitamin D), less dense breasts</title><link>/posts/more-sunlight-more-vitamin-d-less-dense-breasts.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/more-sunlight-more-vitamin-d-less-dense-breasts.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sunlight-exposure-and-breast-density-a-population-based-study">Sunlight Exposure and Breast Density: A Population-Based Study&lt;/h2>

Or so it would seem from the popular press and Internet.&lt;sup>&lt;a href="http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=11506#bib1">&lt;font color="#FF0000">1&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Global Perspective - Holick</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-global-perspective-holick.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-global-perspective-holick.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It is now generally accepted that vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem that affects not only musculoskeletal health but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. However, there remains cynicism about the lack of randomized controlled trials to support the association studies regarding the nonskeletal health benefits of vitamin D. This review was obtained by searching English-language studies published up to April 1, 2013, in PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (search terms: vitamin D and supplementation) and focuses on recent challenges regarding the definition of vitamin D deficiency and how to achieve optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations from dietary sources, supplements, and sun exposure. The effect of vitamin D on fetal programming epigenetics and gene regulation could potentially explain why vitamin D has been reported to have such wide-ranging health benefits throughout life. There is potentially a great upside to increasing the vitamin D status of children and adults worldwide for improving musculoskeletal health and reducing the risk of chronic illnesses, including some cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurocognitive disorders, and mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypovitaminosis D in the Middle East and North Africa</title><link>/posts/hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 class="showhide_heading" id="Hypovitaminosis_D_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa:_Prevalence_risk_factors_and_impact_on_outcomes">

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in children aged under 5 years worldwide. Studies in developing countries have suggested an association between nutritional rickets and pneumonia. Since both nutritional rickets and pneumonia are common in Ethiopia, we did a case-control study to determine the role of nutritional rickets in the development of pneumonia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Largest cause of infant deaths is respiratory infections, which is associated with low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/largest-cause-of-infant-deaths-is-respiratory-infections-which-is-associated-with-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/largest-cause-of-infant-deaths-is-respiratory-infections-which-is-associated-with-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-to-improve-treatment-outcomes-among-children-diagnosed-with-respiratory-infections">Vitamin D supplementation to improve treatment outcomes among children diagnosed with respiratory infections&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Acute lower respiratory infections, predominantly pneumonia, kill more children under the age of five in every region of the world 1 than any other cause. In 2007, of the estimated nine million child deaths that occurred globally, close to 20% or 1.8 million were attributable to pneumonia. Undernutrition has been shown to both increase the severity and overall prevalence of acute lower respiratory infections and is an important factor in determining the mortality rates from severe forms of respiratory infections1–4.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets very prevalent in Mongolia – 1998</title><link>/posts/rickets-very-prevalent-in-mongolia-1998.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-very-prevalent-in-mongolia-1998.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="prevalence-of-rickets-in-mongolia">Prevalence of rickets in Mongolia&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Sound clinical nutrition practice is grounded in evidence and stimulated by research. Yet, there are unanswered questions about food-health relationships. Clinical nutrition involves the identification of nutritional disorders and the motivation to rectify them with all required care. Vitamin D health exemplifies the biomedical, societal and environmental dimensions of clinical nutrition, its science and practice. It depends most of all on access to sunshine and food and probably represents a paradigm in human health which is still at its beginning. Nevertheless, the problem of its deficiency is much more widespread and common than has been thought since it was first identified as a cause of rickets and osteomalacia. &lt;strong>It is now known to spare no body organ or system&lt;/strong> . The problem in North-East Asia is comparable to much of the rest of the world, but the risk profile for it is &lt;strong>exaggerated by atmospheric pollution, cultures with sun-avoidance on account of skin colour&lt;/strong> and potentially mitigated by foodstuffs like fish, eggs, organ meats and mushrooms which can partially offset sunshine-deficiency. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and confirmation by biochemistry which may not be affordable. Therefore a close working relationship between public health and clinical nutritionist is essential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency in Middle East and North Africa</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-prevalence-risk-factors-and-impact-on-outcomes">Hypovitaminosis D in the Middle East and North Africa: Prevalence, risk factors and impact on outcomes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In sepsis, the vitamin D active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) may play a crucial role by its action to produce cathelicidin and improve endothelial barrier function, such that a deficiency in 1,25(OH)2D is associated with poor outcome. To test our hypothesis, we performed analysis of stored plasma samples from a prospective observational study in 91 patients with sepsis, age of 59.1+/−2.0 years, 52.7% females, and 11.0% deaths at 30 days. Vitamin D status, including 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25(OH)2D, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25(OH)2D), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), were measured daily over 3 days after hospital admission. At baseline, 1,25(OH)2D was significantly different between survivors vs. non-survivors. But there was no significant difference in 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and PTH. In a multivariable binomial logistic regression model, age, total calcium and 1,25(OH)2D were significant predictors of 30-day mortality. Kaplan Meier analysis showed that patients with mean 1,25(OH)2D measured over 3 days of &amp;lt; = 13.6 pg/mL had 57.1% 30-day survival compared to 91.7% in patients with 1,25 (OH)2D level &amp;gt;13.6 pg/mL (p&amp;lt;0.01). From repeated measures regression analysis, there was significant increase in 1,25(OH)2D for increases in 25(OH)D in both survivors and non-survivors. However, compared to survivors, the low 25(OH)D in non-survivors was insufficient to account for the larger decrease in 1,25(OH)2D, indicating a dysfunctional 1α-hydroxylase. Additionally, there was a significant negative correlation between PTH and 1,25(OH)2D in both survivors and non-survivors, suggesting a severe impairment in the effect of PTH to increase renal 1α-hydroxylase activity. In conclusion, low 1,25(OH)2D levels are associated with increased 30-day mortality in sepsis patients, likely due to impaired 25(OH)D hydroxylation and PTH insensitivity. Our data also suggest that the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D may be an important therapeutic target in the design of sepsis clinical trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chart of Vitamin D levels vs race</title><link>/posts/chart-of-vitamin-d-levels-vs-race.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chart-of-vitamin-d-levels-vs-race.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="chart-had-been-from-vitamin-d-council-ceased-operation-2017">Chart had been from Vitamin D Council (ceased operation ~2017)&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: In human beings, dark skin requires more exposure to ultraviolet light to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D as lighter skin. It is has been repeatedly shown that at the latitude of the United States there are vitamin D disparities related to skin color. Although inadequate vitamin D status and health disparities have been associated with many of the same diseases, neither nutrition policy nor public health policy in the United States currently recognizes any role at all for vitamin D as a determinant of health disparities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Might Vitamin D be the fountain of youth</title><link>/posts/might-vitamin-d-be-the-fountain-of-youth.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/might-vitamin-d-be-the-fountain-of-youth.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="scientific-overview-of-hormone-treatment-used-for-rejuvenation">Scientific overview of hormone treatment used for rejuvenation&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>PURPOSE:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin A (retinol), vitamin E, and vitamin D (total 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin, 1,25(OH)(2)D) are protective against prostate cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive, &lt;strong>with positive and null associations reported for all three vitamins&lt;/strong> . Limitations of previous studies include small sample size, lack of population controls, and reliance on self-reported dietary intake. Few studies have explored the interactions of circulating 25(OH)D with 1,25(OH)(2)D or retinol, which are biologically plausible interactions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D protects against many types of health problems – review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-protects-against-many-types-of-health-problems-review.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-protects-against-many-types-of-health-problems-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-effects-on-musculoskeletal-health-immunity-autoimmunity-cardiovascular-disease-cancer-fertility-pregnancy-dementia-and-mortality-a-review-of-recent-evidence">Vitamin D effects on musculoskeletal health, immunity, autoimmunity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, fertility, pregnancy, dementia and mortality-A review of recent evidence.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Hypovitaminosis D is a very common disorder, regarding both Western and developing countries. A growing amount of data over the last years have shown vitamin D deficiency to be high prevalent among HIV-positive subjects. In addition to &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; risk factors, such as female sex, low dietary intake, dark skin pigmentation and low sun exposure, HlV-related factors, including immune activation and anti-retroviral adverse effects, may affect vitamin D status. Even if both protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been associated with low vitamin D levels, available evidences have failed to univocally associate hypovitaminosis D with specific antiretroviral class effects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review of Vitamin D and Physical Performance</title><link>/posts/review-of-vitamin-d-and-physical-performance.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/review-of-vitamin-d-and-physical-performance.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-and-physical-performance">Vitamin D and Physical Performance&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Although Vitamin D is believed to be involved in a large number of immune responses our understanding of these processes at cellular level remained at infancy. We develop and solve a coarse grained kinetic network model to quantify the effects of variation of vitamin D on human immunity. The system of equations accounts for known inter-relation between active and inactive vitamin D, antigen presenting cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells and pathogen. Both time dependent and steady state solutions are obtained. The time dependent solution of the system of equations reveals that the immune response is rather strongly regulated in presence of vitamin D. We found quantitatively that lower than optimum levels of concentration of active vitamin D correspond to weak regulation where, once a pathogen/antigen enters the body, the nature of the immune response would be less regulatory and hence more aggressive, or inflammatory. The steady state solution of our model shows that vitamin D enhances the tolerance level of immune system, thereby increasing resistance to autoimmune diseases. Our model and accompanied numerical analyses reveal another important aspect of immunity: While extremely low levels of vitamin D could lead to increased risk of autoimmune responses, an overdose (toxic) level would give rise to too large a tolerant response, leading to the increased risk of tumors and cancerous cell growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summary of Vitamin D portion of Bone and Mineral Research Meeting</title><link>/posts/summary-of-vitamin-d-portion-of-bone-and-mineral-research-meeting.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/summary-of-vitamin-d-portion-of-bone-and-mineral-research-meeting.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="meeting-report-from-the-34th-annual-meeting-of-the-american-society-for-bone-and-mineral-research">Meeting report from the 34th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is well known for its effects on promoting bone mineralization as the primary characteristic of rickets, and osteomalacia refers to decreased mineralization of the bone matrix. However, the direct effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone cells need further clarification. Earlier studies revealed that overexpression of VDR in osteoblasts (driven by osteocalcin promoter) increased bone mass and strength.1 Deletion of VDR in osteocytes (using a dmp1 cre system) did not influence bone mass or other parameters of bone metabolism.2 Deletion of VDR in osteoblasts using an osteocalcin cre system, however, increased (&amp;gt;20%) bone mass (total and trabecular femoral bone, mainly by increase in the number of trabeculae) as reported by Anderson et al.3 and by S Kato (presented at the 2012 Endocrine Society Meeting as summarized in Bouillon4). However, the mechanisms involved are not clear, as preliminary data suggested increase bone formation (as reported by Anderson et al.3) and decreased bone resorption in the Japanese osteoblast-selective VDR mice. These observations imply that VDR activation can have beneficial effects (prevent rickets and osteomalacia) but can also impair bone formation or mineralization in case of exposure to very high serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D.2, 5 Such negative effects of vitamin D on mineral deposition were also observed by studying the gene expression profile after exposure to 1,25(OH)2D (Pike’s group, as reported in the previous BoneKey Report4) and now in a series of in vitro experiments using osteoblasts from different regions (calvaria and femur). Exposure to 1,25(OH)2D could inhibit mineral deposition in early-stage calvaria-derived osteoblasts, whereas it enhanced mineral deposition in more mature cortical-bone-derived osteoblasts, at least in the presence of high extracellular calcium concentration.6 The direct effects of the vitamin D endocrine system on bone cells were also explored by analyzing mice with transgenic overexpression of cyp27b1 in osteoblasts using an osteocalcin promoter region. At 20 weeks of age, such mice displayed a 10% increase in bone volume as well in the lumbar vertebrae as in the femoral metaphysis.7 This beneficial effect was due to increased bone formation with unaltered bone resorption, indicating a direct bone anabolic effect of locally produced 1,25(OH)2D in osteoblasts. All these new observations indicate that the vitamin D endocrine system has a yin/yang effect on bone: in most circumstances it enhances mineral deposition but in the presence of low calcium supply the vitamin D endocrine system tries to maintain serum calcium homeostasis at the expense of bone (increased resorption and decreased mineralization).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beijing extremely vitamin D deficient even in the fall: 10 ng</title><link>/posts/beijing-extremely-vitamin-d-deficient-even-in-the-fall-10-ng.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/beijing-extremely-vitamin-d-deficient-even-in-the-fall-10-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-status-in-mainland-china">Vitamin D status in Mainland China&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>As an essential dietary micronutrient, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in promoting calcium absorption in the intestine and maintaining a healthy skeletal system throughout life. Beyond bone health, an emerging volume of scientific studies shows that vitamin D also may provide cardiovascular, metabolic, and immunologic benefits and reduce mortality. To our knowledge, in mainland China no national surveys have been conducted to date to depict the overall vitamin D status in the population. Therefore, the purpose of this contribution was to provide the best possible evaluation of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in China by reviewing publications that measured plasma/serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) levels in various age groups and in different areas of China from &lt;strong>January 2000 to June 2012.&lt;/strong> From these investigations conducted throughout the country and from newborns to adults to the elderly, it has been found that &lt;strong>vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is prevalent in the Chinese population in almost all age groups and areas if individuals are not taking vitamin D–fortified products/supplements or are lacking sufficient sunshine exposure&lt;/strong> .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sunlight, Vitamin D and Skin Cancer – 2nd edition</title><link>/posts/sunlight-vitamin-d-and-skin-cancer-2nd-edition.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sunlight-vitamin-d-and-skin-cancer-2nd-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sunlight-Vitamin-Advances-Experimental-Medicine/dp/0387775730/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1366405896&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Sunlight%2C+Vitamin+D+and+Skin+Cancer%20">Amazon &lt;/a> 2008 edition&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the carcinogen that causes the most common malignancy in humans - skin cancer. However, moderate UV exposure is essential for producing vitamin D in our skin. Vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium from the diet, and adequate calcium is necessary for the building and maintenance of bones. Thus, low levels of vitamin D can cause osteomalacia and rickets and contribute to osteoporosis. Emerging evidence also suggests vitamin D may protect against falls, internal cancers, psychiatric conditions, autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Since the dominant source of vitamin D is sunlight exposure, there is a need to understand what is a &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; level of sun exposure to maintain an adequate level of vitamin D but minimise the risks of eye damage, skin damage and skin cancer resulting from excessive UV exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and breast cancer – overview – Oncologist 2012</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-overview-oncologist-2012.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-overview-oncologist-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer">Vitamin D and breast cancer.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>45 percent fewer deaths from digestive cancers for 10 ng increase in vitamin D – 2006</title><link>/posts/45-percent-fewer-deaths-from-digestive-cancers-for-10-ng-increase-in-vitamin-d-2006.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/45-percent-fewer-deaths-from-digestive-cancers-for-10-ng-increase-in-vitamin-d-2006.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="prospective-study-of-predictors-of-vitamin-d-status-and-cancer-incidence-and-mortality-in-men">Prospective study of predictors of vitamin D status and cancer incidence and mortality in men.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has potent anticancer properties, especially against digestive-system cancers. Many human studies have used geographic residence as a marker of solar ultraviolet B and hence vitamin D exposure. Here, we considered multiple determinants of vitamin D exposure (dietary and supplementary vitamin D, skin pigmentation, adiposity, geographic residence, and leisure-time physical activity-to estimate sunlight exposure) in relation to cancer risk in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Common Vitamin D gene variants and resulting diseases</title><link>/posts/common-vitamin-d-gene-variants-and-resulting-diseases.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/common-vitamin-d-gene-variants-and-resulting-diseases.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is the major plasma carrier for vitamin D and its metabolites, but it is also an actin scavenger, and is the precursor to the immunomodulatory protein, Gc-MAF. Two missense variants of the DBP gene - rs7041 encoding Asp432Glu and rs4588 encoding Thr436Lys - change the amino acid sequence and alter the protein function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are common enough to generate population-wide constitutive differences in vitamin D status, based on assay of the serum metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Higher levels of Vitamin D assocated with bladder cancer survival by veterans</title><link>/posts/higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-assocated-with-bladder-cancer-survival-by-veterans.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-assocated-with-bladder-cancer-survival-by-veterans.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="relationship-of-vitamin-d-monitoring-and-status-to-bladder-cancer-survival-in-veterans">Relationship of vitamin D monitoring and status to bladder cancer survival in veterans.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVES: Veterans of the armed forces, like most population groups, have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which may be associated with adverse outcomes in several types of cancer. Ultraviolet irradiation is inversely linked with the risk of bladder cancer, presumably through enhanced vitamin D synthesis. We hypothesized that variations in vitamin D status and monitoring predict adverse outcomes in bladder cancer among veterans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Less Solar Radiation was associated with more Cancer - 1941</title><link>/posts/less-solar-radiation-was-associated-with-more-cancer-1941.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/less-solar-radiation-was-associated-with-more-cancer-1941.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The goal of this volume is to comprehensively cover a highly readable overview on our present knowledge of positive and negative effects of UV-exposure, with a focus on vitamin D and skin cancer. Topics that are discussed in-depth by leading researchers and clinicians range from the newest findings in endocrinology, epidemiology, histology, photobiology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular pathology to new concepts for prophylaxis and treatment. Experts in the field as well as health care professionals not intimately involved in these specialized areas are provided with the most significant and timely information related to these topics. It is the aim of this book to summarize essential up-to-date information for every clinician or scientist interested in how to balance between positive and negative effects of UV-exposure to minimize the risks of developing vitamin D deficiency and skin cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D – Continuing Medical Education – 2013</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-continuing-medical-education-2013.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-continuing-medical-education-2013.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-in-clinical-practice">Vitamin D in clinical practice&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D has long been known to be essential in bone mineralization as well as calcium and phosphate regulation. An increasing body ofliterature suggests that Vitamin D is also key in many other areas to include immune function, brain development, prevention of autoimmune disease, and prevention of certain types of cancers. Studies also suggest that, with decreased sun exposure due to concern for skin cancer risk, much of the world&amp;rsquo;s population is becoming increasingly deficient in vitamin D. Our hypothesis was that vitamin D deficiency exists, and can be detected, even in sunny climates such as the state ofHawaii. To test this hypothesis, eighty-six cord blood samples were collected in the process of routine clinical testing. These samples were tested for 25-hydroxy vitamin D via liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. Percent deficiency (&amp;lt;20ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-31.9ng/mL) were determined by statistical analysis. Forty-six percent (n=37) of cord blood samples tested were deficient in vitamin D; 47 percent (n=38) of samples had insufficient 25-OH vitamin D. &lt;strong>Only 7 percent (n=6) of samples showed vitamin D concentrations at the recommended levels.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>US Minorities have poor health – how much is due to little sun</title><link>/posts/us-minorities-have-poor-health-how-much-is-due-to-little-sun.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/us-minorities-have-poor-health-how-much-is-due-to-little-sun.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Minority Health: Recent Findings&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>• Using evidence to improve health care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• Improving health care outcomes through research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>• Transforming research into practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The overall health of the American population has improved over the past few decades, but not all Americans have benefitted equally from these improvements. Minority populations, in particular, continue to lag behind whites in a number of areas, including quality of care, access to care, timeliness, and outcomes. Other health care problems that disproportionately affect minorities include provider biases, poor provider-patient communication, and health literacy issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low Vitamin D associated with a variety of causes of death a decade later</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-associated-with-a-variety-of-causes-of-death-a-decade-later.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-associated-with-a-variety-of-causes-of-death-a-decade-later.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="strong-associations-of-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-concentrations-with-all-cause-cardiovascular-cancer-and-respiratory-disease-mortality-in-a-large-cohort-study">Strong associations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer, and respiratory disease mortality in a large cohort study.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVES:Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) antagonise each other in (re)absorption, inflammation and many other physiological activities. Based on mathematical estimation, the absorbed number of Ca or Mg depends on the dietary ratio of Ca to Mg intake. We hypothesise that the dietary Ca/Mg ratio modifies the effects of Ca and Mg on mortality due to gastrointestinal tract cancer and, perhaps, mortality due to diseases occurring in other organs or systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A look at inner workings of committee looking at vitamin D for UK</title><link>/posts/a-look-at-inner-workings-of-committee-looking-at-vitamin-d-for-uk.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/a-look-at-inner-workings-of-committee-looking-at-vitamin-d-for-uk.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="context-by-vitamindwiki">Context by VitaminDWiki&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ankylosing spondylitis and low vitamin D – many studies</title><link>/posts/ankylosing-spondylitis-and-low-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ankylosing-spondylitis-and-low-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D, or 1,25-di-hydroxy-vitamin D (1,25(OH)D) in its activated form, has long been recognized as a critical mediator in bone health. New research has identified 1,25(OH)D as also vital for respiratory health. Due to its intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, 1,25(OH)D may be very important in people with asthma. This review article seeks to evaluate the current literature to delineate the potential mechanisms of action by which 1,25(OH)D impacts asthma. We summarize the evidence that 1,25(OH)D has receptors in multiple lung cell types and acts to abrogate asthma by several mechanisms: by promoting lung immunity, by decreasing inflammation, by slowing cell cycling, by reducing hyperplasia, and by enhancing the effects of exogenous steroids. Put together, there is compelling evidence for the role of vitamin D in asthma.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low Magnesium and type II diabetes</title><link>/posts/low-magnesium-and-type-ii-diabetes.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-magnesium-and-type-ii-diabetes.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="correlation-of-magnesium-intake-with-metabolic-parameters-depression-and-physical-activity-in-elderly-type-2-diabetes-patients-a-cross-sectional-study">Correlation of magnesium intake with metabolic parameters, depression and physical activity in elderly type 2 diabetes patients: a cross-sectional study.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVES: Veterans of the armed forces, like most population groups, have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which may be associated with adverse outcomes in several types of cancer. Ultraviolet irradiation is inversely linked with the risk of bladder cancer, presumably through enhanced vitamin D synthesis. We hypothesized that variations in vitamin D status and monitoring predict adverse outcomes in bladder cancer among veterans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and Arterial Hypertension: Treat the Deficiency</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-arterial-hypertension-treat-the-deficiency.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-arterial-hypertension-treat-the-deficiency.html</guid><description>&lt;p>American Journal of Hypertension, Volume 26, Issue 2, Pp. 158.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D compounds may have extraskeletal functions. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) offers an opportunity to investigate these actions, as vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in this population and actions of vitamin D such as those on the heart and glucose metabolism are highly relevant. However, recent randomized controlled trials have tempered enthusiasm. We appraise a trial by de Boer et al. that addresses effects of paricalcitol on glucose metabolism in CKD, and offer perspectives on future trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autoimmunity and vitamin D – review</title><link>/posts/autoimmunity-and-vitamin-d-review.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autoimmunity-and-vitamin-d-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-implication-of-vitamin-d-and-autoimmunity-a-comprehensive-review">The Implication of Vitamin D and Autoimmunity: a Comprehensive Review.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Historically, vitamin D has been associated with the regulation of bone metabolism. However, increasing evidence demonstrates a strong association between vitamin D signaling and many biological processes that regulate immune responses. The discovery of the vitamin D receptor in multiple immune cell lineages, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and activated T cells credits vitamin D with a novel role in modulating immunological functions and its subsequent role in the development or prevention of autoimmune diseases. In this review we, discuss five major areas in vitamin D biology of high immunological significance:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>20 percent of Critically ill in India had undetectable vitamin D, and 62 percent died</title><link>/posts/20-percent-of-critically-ill-in-india-had-undetectable-vitamin-d-and-62-percent-died.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/20-percent-of-critically-ill-in-india-had-undetectable-vitamin-d-and-62-percent-died.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-in-critical-illness-and-its-influence-on-outcome-experience-from-tertiary-care-centre-in-north-india">Vitamin D Deficiency in Critical Illness and Its Influence on Outcome: Experience From Tertiary Care Centre in North India&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Introduction: Whether the degree of vitamin D deficiency affects survival following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is not clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hypothesis: We hypothesize that pre-hospital vitamin D deficiency is associated with mortality following CABG.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study between 2001 and 2010 in two teaching hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts utilizing an institutional Research Patient Data Registry. We studied 322 patients, age = 18 years, in whom 25(OH)D was measured prior to hospitalization. The exposure of interest was pre-admission 25(OH)D categorized a priori as deficiency in 25(OH)D (=15ng/mL), insufficiency (15-30 ng/mL) and sufficiency (=30ng/mL). The primary outcome was all cause mortality 90 days following CABG. Vital status was obtained from the Social Security Administration Death Master File. Associations between vitamin D groups and mortality were estimated by bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doubt that vitamin D prevents fractures, especially without Calcium</title><link>/posts/doubt-that-vitamin-d-prevents-fractures-especially-without-calcium.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/doubt-that-vitamin-d-prevents-fractures-especially-without-calcium.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="commentary-on-a-pooled-analysis-of-vitamin-d-dose-requirements-for-fracture-prevention">COMMENTARY on A pooled analysis of Vitamin D dose requirements for fracture prevention&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Summary	In this thesis the connection between vitamin D-insufficiency, sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome has been examined. Vitamin D-insufficiency is common in germany regardless of age but has an even higher prevalence in the elderly. Sarcopenia describes the age-associated and functional relevant loss of muscle mass -following some definitions also muscle strength- whereas the frailty-syndrome is a multidimensional syndrome leading to negative outcomes such as heightened mortality. The hypothesis was that vitamin D-insufficiency favors the incidence of sarcopenia as well as frailty and that sarcopenia is a key factor in the development of the frailty-syndrome. Vice versa it could be imagined that frailty with limited mobility could lead to vitamin d-insuffiency due to reduced time spent outside and limited sun exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sunshine: Dangerous or Healthy – Schachter Center 2009</title><link>/posts/sunshine-dangerous-or-healthy-schachter-center-2009.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sunshine-dangerous-or-healthy-schachter-center-2009.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sunshine-dangerous-or-healthyhttpwwwschachtercentercomsunshinehtm20-2009">&lt;a href="http://www.schachtercenter.com/sunshine.htm%20">Sunshine: Dangerous or Healthy?&lt;/a> 2009&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Currently, some 600,000 new cases of skin cancer are reported every year.(1) Over the years, there have been numerous publications making the claim that sunshine exposure increases the risk of developing skin cancer as well as hastens aging of the skin. It would seem, therefore, that &amp;ldquo;avoiding the sun&amp;rdquo; would be an obvious response to this problem. It is believed that Ultraviolet A rays are the cause of hastened aging and skin cancer while the Ultraviolet B rays are the source of sunburn. The UVB rays are also the source for making Vitamin D in the skin. Melanomas are currently the tenth most common form of cancer in the U.S.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin A (Cod Liver Oil) blocks vitamin D – 2008</title><link>/posts/vitamin-a-cod-liver-oil-blocks-vitamin-d-2008.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-a-cod-liver-oil-blocks-vitamin-d-2008.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cod-liver-oil-vitamin-a-toxicity-frequent-respiratory-infections-and-the-vitamin-d-deficiency-epidemic">Cod Liver Oil, Vitamin A Toxicity, Frequent Respiratory Infections, and the Vitamin D Deficiency Epidemic&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In the United States, there are significant racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease. The disparities are greatest for the Blacks and the magnitude of disparity is significantly greater than is evident from the incidence and prevalence data of end-stage renal disease - early stage chronic kidney disease is less common in Blacks and during that stage, mortality rate is significantly higher for that racial group. Recent studies have identified a genetic predisposition for non-diabetic renal disease among Blacks. However, genetic factors explain only part of the higher risk and the racial disparities are a result of a complex interplay of biology and sociology. Herein we focus on two factors and their role in explaining the higher risk for progression of chronic kidney disease among Blacks - one biologic (vitamin D deficiency) and one sociologic (neighborhood poverty). A greater Understanding of these factors is important in order to reduce the racial disparities in the United States.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low vitamin D increases risk of cardiovascular disease in African Americans – 2011</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-increases-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-african-americans-2011.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-increases-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-in-african-americans-2011.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-and-cardiovascular-disease-potential-role-in-health-disparities">Vitamin D and cardiovascular disease: potential role in health disparities.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary artery disease and stroke, is the leading cause of mortality in the nation. Excess CVD morbidity and premature mortality in the African American community is one of the most striking examples of racial/ ethnic disparities in health outcomes. African Americans also suffer from increased rates of hypovitaminosis D, which has emerged as an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This overview examines the potential role of hypovitaminosis D as a contributor to racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD). We review the epidemiology of vitamin D and CVD in African Americans and the emerging biological roles of vitamin D in key CVD signaling pathways that may contribute to the epidemiological findings and provide the foundation for future therapeutic strategies for reducing health disparities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnesium may be an important way to treat brain trauma</title><link>/posts/magnesium-may-be-an-important-way-to-treat-brain-trauma.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/magnesium-may-be-an-important-way-to-treat-brain-trauma.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="your-bones-are-21-calciummagnesium-ratio-while-your-brain-is-more-like-21-mgca">Your bones are 2:1 calcium/magnesium ratio while your brain is more like 2:1 Mg:Ca&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Recent studies have suggested that low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) are associated with cardiovascular risks in medical patients. However, these associations have not been well documented in high risk surgical patients. We hypothesized that serum 25OHD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25OHD) would be associated with the cardiac operative risk stratification score. The study was conducted with a cross-sectional design at a single academic medical center in Japan. Two hundred five adult patients scheduled for major cardiovascular surgery were included consecutively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nitric oxide (from Sun, UVA, Vitamin D) reduces cardiovascular problems</title><link>/posts/nitric-oxide-from-sun-uva-vitamin-d-reduces-cardiovascular-problems.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/nitric-oxide-from-sun-uva-vitamin-d-reduces-cardiovascular-problems.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Aims: Patients with advanced liver disease frequently suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D serves an important role in regulating immune response mechanisms, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with unfavourable outcomes in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C. However, it remains unknown whether vitamin D deficiency has an influence on mortality in these patients. Thus, we prospectively studied a cohort of patients with advanced liver disease to assess the influence of vitamin D deficiency on survival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiple Sclerosis and vitamin D – Systematic Review inconclusive</title><link>/posts/multiple-sclerosis-and-vitamin-d-systematic-review-inconclusive.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/multiple-sclerosis-and-vitamin-d-systematic-review-inconclusive.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-systematic-review-of-randomized-double-blind-placebo-controlled-trials-examining-the-clinical-efficacy-of-vitamin-d-in-multiple-sclerosis">A Systematic Review of Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials Examining the Clinical Efficacy of Vitamin D in Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Introduction: Vitamin D plasma levels are negatively associated with blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality, and vitamin D supplementation reduces cardiovascular events. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) suppression may be one of the mechanisms involved. However, there are no interventional prospective studies demonstrating a reduction in circulating RAS components after vitamin D treatment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Healthy bones need Ca, Silicon, Vitamins B, C, D, and K</title><link>/posts/healthy-bones-need-ca-silicon-vitamins-b-c-d-and-k.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/healthy-bones-need-ca-silicon-vitamins-b-c-d-and-k.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Update on nutrients involved in maintaining healthy bone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Osteoporosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and influences quality of life, as well as life expectancy. Currently, there is a growing interest among the medical scientists in search of specific nutrients and/or bioactive compounds of natural origin for the prevention of disease and maintenance of bone health. Although calcium and vitamin D have been the primary focus of nutritional prevention of osteoporosis, a recent research has clarified the importance of several additional nutrients and food constituents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Candidate list of top vitamin D papers for 2012</title><link>/posts/candidate-list-of-top-vitamin-d-papers-for-2012.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/candidate-list-of-top-vitamin-d-papers-for-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="by-william-b-grant-et-al-dec-25-2012">By William B.

&lt;p>Solar UV (UV) radiation is the main source of vitamin D production and is also the most important environmental risk factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) development. In the present study the relationship between daily or seasonal UV radiation doses and vitamin D status, dietary vitamin D intake and CMM incidence rates at different geographical latitudes were investigated. South-North gradients of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) generation and CMM induction were calculated, based on known action spectra, and compared with measured vitamin D levels and epidemiological data on CMM. The relative roles of UVA and UVB in CMM induction are discussed. Latitudinal dependencies of serum 25(OH)D levels and CMM incidence rates can only partly be explained by ambient UV doses. The UV sensitivity is obviously different for different populations. This is well known for CMM, but seems also to be true for vitamin D status. The fact that UV-induced vitamin D may reduce the risk of CMM complicates the discussion. To some extent high dietary vitamin D intake seems to compensate low UV doses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off topic: Special issue on Longevity in the Journal Nature - free text</title><link>/posts/off-topic-special-issue-on-longevity-in-the-journal-nature-free-text.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-special-issue-on-longevity-in-the-journal-nature-free-text.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="naturehttpwwwnaturecomnaturejournalv492n7427_suppindexhtml-06-december-2012">&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v492/n7427_supp/index.html">Nature&lt;/a> (06 December 2012)&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Garland and Garland first hypothesized that better vitamin D status lowered risk of colorectal cancer in 1980. Subsequently, the relation between vitamin D status and colorectal cancer risk has been investigated in epidemiologic studies. Various approaches have been used to estimate vitamin D status, including direct measures of circulating 25(OH)vitamin D levels, surrogates or determinants of vitamin D (including region of residence, intake, and sun exposure estimates, or a combination of these). These measures of vitamin D status have been studied in relation to colorectal adenoma, precursors of cancer, and colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solar UVB reduces Cancer Risk – Grant,</title><link>/posts/solar-uvb-reduces-cancer-risk-grant.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/solar-uvb-reduces-cancer-risk-grant.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="update-on-evidence-that-support-a-role-of-solar-ultraviolet-b-irradiance-in-reducing-cancer-risk">Update on Evidence that Support a Role of Solar Ultraviolet-B Irradiance in Reducing Cancer Risk&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D3 is biologically inert. To become active, it requires two successive hydroxylation steps catalyzed by two cytochrome P450 enzymes, first to synthesize the pro-hormone 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 &lt;span>[25(OH)D3]&lt;/span> and then the active hormone 1α,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 &lt;span>[1α,25(OH)2D3]&lt;/span>. 1α,25(OH)2D3 has high affinity for the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a transcription factor and a member of the steroid receptor superfamily. Through VDR, 1α,25(OH)2D3 regulates more than 200 genes in mammals, including those involved in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, immune function, reproduction, cardiovascular, central nerve system, inflammation, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Due to its versatile roles in maintaining and regulating normal cellular phenotypes and functions, 1α,25(OH)2D3 has been implicated as an anti-cancer agent. In fact, ecological and epidemiologic data have linked vitamin D deficiency with the incidence and mortality of many types of cancer. More importantly, in vitro and in vivo animal model studies have clearly demonstrated the anti-tumor effects of vitamin D. In this review, we describe the anticancer actions of vitamin D, with special emphasis on different pathways underlying the VDR-mediated genomic as well as less-defined non-genomic actions of vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and Cancer Mortality – review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-cancer-mortality-review.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-cancer-mortality-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-and-cancer-mortality-systematic-review-of-prospective-epidemiological-studies">Vitamin D and Cancer Mortality: Systematic Review of Prospective Epidemiological Studies&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Accumulating evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies suggests that vitamin D deficiency might be a causal risk factor for cancer and therewith associated mortality. We performed a systematic review in Medline up to February 2012 to identify prospective studies on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) and cancer mortality as well as on 25(OH)D and survival in cancer patients. Our search retrieved 13 studies on cancer-specific mortality and 20 studies on overall mortality in cancer patients. Data on 25(OH)D and cancer mortality were mainly derived from general populations. The results were inconsistent and yielded either no, inverse or positive associations. By contrast, the majority of studies in cancer patients showed that patients with higher 25(OH)D levels had a decreased risk of mortality. This relationship was particularly evident in cohorts of colorectal cancer patients. In contrast, there was no indication for increased mortality risk with higher vitamin D levels in any cancer cohort. In conclusion, the relationship of vitamin D status and cancer specific mortality is still unclear and warrants further studies. Our results provide a strong rationale to perform prospective randomized controlled studies to document a potential effect of vitamin D supplementation on survival in cancer patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Supplementation and Cancer - Review of RCT</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-and-cancer-review-of-rct.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-and-cancer-review-of-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-and-cancer">Vitamin D Supplementation and Cancer:&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Data from experimental studies suggest that vitamin D receptor activation exerts anti-cancer effects on virtually all steps of carcinogenesis. Epidemiological data support an inverse association of vitamin D serum levels and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms with cancer incidence and mortality. Based on this promising rationale for use of vitamin D and its analogues in cancer prevention and treatment, several interventional studies have been initiated and partially published. Trials with vitamin D were mainly organized for the prevention of fracture in elderly people, usually in association with calcium supplements. Prevention studies with vitamin D have rarely been done in the context of vitamin D to evaluate a protective effect on cancer. Findings from prospective cohort studies on colorectal cancer risk and on mortality constitute pieces of evidence strong enough to consider that previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D use and cancer may not have correctly addressed the question, and that new randomized trials should be organized. The reasons are due to several unsolved issues including selection of the effective dose, varying baseline levels of subjects before randomization, compliance with the intervention, contamination of the placebo group (i.e., intake of vitamin D supplements by subjects allocated to the placebo group) and unknown effective lag time between start of the intervention and disease onset. The present review summarizes the existing knowledge on vitamin D RCTs and cancer. In addition we also briefly describe the design of some ongoing trials on vitamin D supplementation and cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D, Sunlight and Cancer Connection – Holick</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-cancer-connection-holick.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-cancer-connection-holick.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry Volume 13 Issue 1 pp.70-82 (13)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It has been more than 100 years when it was first appreciated that increased sun exposure reduced risk of dying of cancer. The most beneficial effect of sun exposure is the production of vitamin D in the skin. Recent evidence suggests that most cells in the body not only have a vitamin D receptor but also have the capacity to convert 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Once formed 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can inhibit cellular proliferation, induce cellular maturation, inhibit angiogenesis and ultimately cause apoptosis to prevent malignancy. A multitude of studies have associated improved vitamin D status with decreased risk for developing several deadly cancers including colon, breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Patients with cancer are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. Sensible sun exposure, vitamin D fortification and vitamin D supplementation should be encouraged to improve the vitamin D status of children and adults not only for bone health but for reducing risk of developing and dying of cancer. The goal is to achieve a blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 40-60 ng/mL. This can be accomplished by children taking 600-1000 and adults 1500-2000 international units (IU) vitamin D daily from diet and supplements along with sensible sun exposure when the sun is capable of producing vitamin D in the skin.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D, Sunlight, and the Epidemiology of Prostate Cancer</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-the-epidemiology-of-prostate-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-sunlight-and-the-epidemiology-of-prostate-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry Volume 13 Issue 1 pp.45-57 (13)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of clinical prostate cancer has stimulated an extensive body of research. Ecologic studies have shown that mortality rates from prostate cancer are inversely correlated with levels of ultraviolet radiation, the principal source of vitamin D. Human prostate cells express receptors for 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D which exerts pleitropic anticancer effects on these cells in vitro and in animal models. Moreover, normal prostate cells synthesize 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D from circulating levels of 25-OHD, whose levels are dependent on exposure to ultraviolet light.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The problems of vitamin d insufficiency in older people</title><link>/posts/the-problems-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-older-people.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-problems-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-older-people.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-problems-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-older-people">The problems of vitamin d insufficiency in older people.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This report reviews evidence on disorders related to inadequate vitamin D repletion in older people. Vitamin D is as essential for bone health in adults as in children, preventing osteomalacia and muscle weakness and protecting against falls and low-impact fractures. Vitamin D is provided by skin synthesis by UVB-irradiation from summer sunshine and to a small extent by absorption from food. However, these processes become less efficient with age. Loss of mobility or residential care restricts solar exposure. Reduced appetite and financial problems often add to these problems. Thus, hypovitaminosis D is common world-wide, but is more common and more severe in older people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Active vitamin D treats Chronic Kidney Disease by stimulating Klotho production</title><link>/posts/active-vitamin-d-treats-chronic-kidney-disease-by-stimulating-klotho-production.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/active-vitamin-d-treats-chronic-kidney-disease-by-stimulating-klotho-production.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-secreted-klotho-a-long-awaited-panacea-for-vascular-calcification">Vitamin D and secreted Klotho: a long-awaited panacea for vascular calcification?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by accelerated vascular calcification, which may in part be caused by deficiency of the anti-aging factor Klotho. Lau et al. demonstrate that administration of active vitamin D and its analog decreases aortic calcification in association with increases in two potent calcification inhibitors—the secreted form of Klotho and vascular osteopontin. These data might provide a new perspective on the association of active vitamin D with improved survival in patients with CKD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low vitamin D associated with osteoporotic fractures up to 10 years later</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-associated-with-osteoporotic-fractures-up-to-10-years-later.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-associated-with-osteoporotic-fractures-up-to-10-years-later.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-risk-of-major-osteoporotic-fractures-in-older-us-adults">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of major osteoporotic fractures in older U.S. adults&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>From my review of the journal literature, 30 ng/ml is the minimum 25(OH)D concentration associated with optimal health. This value has been reported for pregnancy outcomes, breast cancer in case-control studies, colorectal cancer in case-control and cohort studies, cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality rate, and agreed to in several reviews &lt;span>[Bischoff-Ferrari, 2006, 2008; Holick, 2011; Miller, 2011; Pérez-López, 2012; Souberbielle, 2010; Vieth, 2011]&lt;/span>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D, Beyond the Bone – Presentation New York</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-beyond-the-bone-presentation-new-york.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-beyond-the-bone-presentation-new-york.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Presented by the Abbott Nutrition Health Institute, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First identified nearly a century ago for its essential role in maintaining bone health, vitamin D has recently undergone a renaissance of interest due to the resurgence of vitamin D deficiency and the identification of vitamin D receptors in tissues and cells outside the skeletal system. Indeed, a growing body of evidence indicates that vitamin D has several extraskeletal functions and plays a key role in the immune, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. Furthermore, a growing body of research links vitamin D status to health and vitamin D deficiency to the risk of developing certain diseases, including cancers, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. On September 21, 2012, basic science and clinical researchers gathered to discuss non-classical effects at the Vitamin D: Beyond Bone conference presented by the Abbott Nutrition Health Institute, the Sackler Institute for Nutrition Science, and the New York Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancer - Prostate</title><link>/posts/cancer-prostate.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-prostate.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Garland and Garland first hypothesized that better vitamin D status lowered risk of colorectal cancer in &lt;strong>1980&lt;/strong> . Subsequently, the relation between vitamin D status and colorectal cancer risk has been investigated in epidemiologic studies. Various approaches have been used to estimate vitamin D status, including direct measures of circulating 25(OH)vitamin D levels, surrogates or determinants of vitamin D (including region of residence, intake, and sun exposure estimates, or a combination of these).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D still appears to reduce Cancer Mortality – Systematic Review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-still-appears-to-reduce-cancer-mortality-systematic-review.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-still-appears-to-reduce-cancer-mortality-systematic-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-and-cancer-mortality">Vitamin D and Cancer Mortality:&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Each day, Apollo’s fiery chariot makes its way across the sky, bringing life-giving light to the planet. For the ancient Greeks and Romans, Apollo was the god of medicine and healing as well as of sun and light—but Apollo could bring sickness as well as cure. Today’s scientists have come to a similarly dichotomous recognition that exposure to the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight has both beneficial and deleterious effects on human health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VITAMIN D: A D-LIGHTFUL SOLUTION FOR GOOD HEALTH – Holick 2012</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-a-d-lightful-solution-for-good-health-holick-2012.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-a-d-lightful-solution-for-good-health-holick-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;p>J Med Biochem 31: 263-264, 2012; Editorial&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Adequate vitamin D nutrition is associated with the prevention of rickets in children and therefore little thought is given to the consequences of vitamin D deficiency in adults. However, it is now becoming clear that vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining bone health from birth until death. Of equal importance is that vitamin D has a multitude of other biologic functions in the body that may be significant for the prevention of common cancers, hypertension, type 1 diabetes, as well as a host of other common maladies that afflict elders (1-4).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D may prevent falls and fractures without Calcium – an overview of 9 meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-may-prevent-falls-and-fractures-without-calcium-an-overview-of-9-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-may-prevent-falls-and-fractures-without-calcium-an-overview-of-9-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="do-we-need-to-take-calcium-with-vitamin-d-supplements-to-prevent-falls-fractures-and-death">Do we need to take calcium with vitamin D supplements to prevent falls, fractures, and death?&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2011 report by the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D is based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which concluded that vitamin D supplements need to be taken with calcium supplements to prevent falls, fractures, and all-cause mortality. This study reviews recent meta-analyses of RCTs of vitamin D supplementation to determine whether their conclusions are consistent with the meta-analyses underpinning the IOM report.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin and Mineral deficiencies – Ames Triage Theory</title><link>/posts/vitamin-and-mineral-deficiencies-ames-triage-theory.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-and-mineral-deficiencies-ames-triage-theory.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-and-mineral-inadequacy-accelerates-aging-associated-diseases">Vitamin and Mineral Inadequacy Accelerates Aging-Associated Diseases&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>I posited, and have buttressed, &amp;ldquo;triage theory&amp;rdquo; (1,2): metabolism responds to moderate deficiency of an essential vitamin or mineral (V/M) so that the scarce V/M is preferentially retained by V/M-dependent proteins necessary for short-term survival and reproduction. In contrast, proteins needed for long term health, which I term &amp;ldquo;longevity proteins&amp;rdquo; because they defend against the diseases associated with aging, lose the V/M and are disabled. Most of the world&amp;rsquo;s population, including that of the U.S., are moderately deficient in one or more of the ~30 essential V/Ms. Moreover, since the damage from moderate deficiency is insidious, its importance for long-term health is not being appreciated. Strong support for triage theory comes from Joyce McCann&amp;rsquo;s analyses of the literature on proteins dependent on vitamin K (3) and on selenium (4). Both have built into metabolism this trade-off between short-term survival and long-term health and each uses a different mechanism to accomplish this end. Theory and evidence suggest that this metabolic trade-off accelerates aging-associated diseases, such as cancer, cognitive decline, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It appears that Vitamin D reduces diabetes by reducing monocyte stress</title><link>/posts/it-appears-that-vitamin-d-reduces-diabetes-by-reducing-monocyte-stress.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/it-appears-that-vitamin-d-reduces-diabetes-by-reducing-monocyte-stress.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-suppression-of-endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-promotes-an-anti-atherogenic">Vitamin D Suppression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Promotes an Anti-Atherogenic&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity/mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but there is a lack of knowledge about the mechanism(s) of increased atherosclerosis in these patients. In patients with T2DM, the prevalence of 25-hydroxy vitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> deficiency is almost twice that for non-diabetics and doubles the relative risk of developing CVD compared to diabetic patients with normal 25(OH)D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D conferences and special issues - 2013</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-conferences-and-special-issues-2013.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-conferences-and-special-issues-2013.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-graphics-and-url-links-are-in-the-doc-file-attached-at-the-bottom-of-this-page">The graphics and URL links are in the DOC file attached at the bottom of this page&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Background: Low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are inversely related to blood pressure (BP) and have been associated with incident hypertension. In people living at northern latitudes diminished cholecalciferol synthesis in the winter increases the risk of vitamin D deficiency. We wanted to test the hypothesis that daily cholecalciferol supplementation in the winter lowers BP in patients with hypertension.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review of Cancer and Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/review-of-cancer-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/review-of-cancer-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Vitamin D and Cancer&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D system is a complex pathway that includes precursors, active metabolites, enzymes, and receptors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This complex system actives several molecular pathways and mediates a multitude of functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the classical role in calcium and bone homeostasis, vitamin D plays “non-calcemic” effects in host defense, inflammation, immunity, and cancer processes as recognized in vitro and in vivo studies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D - Is This The Miracle Vitamin – book</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-is-this-the-miracle-vitamin-book.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-is-this-the-miracle-vitamin-book.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="table-of-contents-followed-by-322-references">Table of Contents (followed by 322 references)&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In this issue of Journal of Clinical Oncology, Crew et al 1 report results of an examination of vitamin D in 103 premenopausal breast cancer patients who participated in a 1-year trial of zoledronate compared with placebo, in which all women received daily vitamin D (400 IU) and calcium (1,000 mg). Seventy-four percent of women were vitamin D deficient at study entry shortly after diagnosis; deficiency was more common in black and Hispanic women than in white women. After 1 year, less than 15% of the white women (but no Hispanic or black women) who had been vitamin D deficient at baseline achieved sufficient levels in their blood. The authors conclude, “…our study suggests that a dose of 400 IU daily is inadequate in breast cancer patients even to maintain skeletal health, and is probably too low for meaningful anticancer effects.” They go on to comment that controversy exists as to the upper safe daily limit of vitamin D supplementation and suggest “…it may be prudent to follow serum levels of 25-OHD &lt;span>[25-hydroxyvitamin D]&lt;/span>…” This carefully conducted study echoes results recently reported by Neuhouser et al 2 (that approximately three fourths of patients with breast cancer from Los Angeles had inadequate blood levels of vitamin D) and by our group3 (that the same proportion of patients with breast cancer in Toronto had inadequate levels).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mortality varies with latitude in the UK</title><link>/posts/mortality-varies-with-latitude-in-the-uk.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/mortality-varies-with-latitude-in-the-uk.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="trends-in-mortality-from-1965-to-2008-across-the-english-north-south-divide-comparative-observational-study">Trends in mortality from 1965 to 2008 across the English north-south divide: comparative observational study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>15 reasons to think that schizophrenia is associated with low vitamin D&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>97% of patients with schizophrenia are vitamin D deficient&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia varies with latitude (UVB) by 10X (controversy)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is more common in those with dark skin (when away from the equator)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is associated with low natal vitamin D&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia has been increasing around the world when vitamin D has been decreasing (controversy)&lt;/p>
