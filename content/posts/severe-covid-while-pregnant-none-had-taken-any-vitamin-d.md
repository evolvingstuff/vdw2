Objective: We aimed to evaluate the vitamin D status of pregnant women with COVID-19, and the association between vitamin D level and severity of COVID-19.

Methods: In this case control study,  **159 women**  with a single pregnancy and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and randomly selected 332 healthy pregnant women with similar gestational ages were included. COVID-19 patients were classified as mild, moderate, and severe. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and 25-OH D vitamin <10 ng/mL was defined as severe vitamin D deficiency, also 25-OH D vitamin level between 20-29 ng/mL (525-725 nmol/L) was defined as vitamin D insufficiency.

Results: Vitamin D levels of the pregnant women in the COVID-19 group (12.46) were lower than the control group (18.76). 25-OH D vitamin levels of those in the mild COVID-19 category (13.69) were significantly higher than those in the moderate/severe category (9.06). In terms of taking vitamin D supplementation, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups.  **However, it was observed that all of those who had severe COVID-19 were the patients who did not take vitamin D supplementation.** 

Conclusion: The vitamin D levels are low in pregnant women with COVID-19. Also, there is a significant difference regarding to vitamin D level and COVID-19 severity in pregnant women. Maintenance of adequate vitamin D level can be useful as an approach for the prevention of an aggressive course of the inflammation induced by this novel coronavirus in pregnant women.

There was no statistically significant relationship between vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 severity (p > 0.05).  **However, it was observed that all of those who had severe COVID-19 were the patients who did not take vitamin D supplementation** . 

In those taking vitamin D supplementation, the mild COVID-19 rate was 77.8 %; while moderate and severe was 22.2 %, as seen in Table 6.
