#### The use of dietary supplements, and the association between supplemental vitamin D and glycaemic control in adult individuals with type 1 diabetes

Diabet Med . 2024 Feb 14:e15308. [doi: 10.1111/dme.15308](https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.15308)

Aims: To assess the dietary supplement use in adult individuals with type 1 diabetes, and to study the association between vitamin D supplementation and glycaemic control in an observational cross-sectional study.

Methods: The study subjects were participants of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study. Data were included from all individuals with type 1 diabetes with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 , who had completed a diet questionnaire. In the questionnaire, the participants reported dietary supplement use for the past 30 days. A thorough investigation with an assessment of the blood panel was conducted at the study visit.

Results: Data were available from 1181 individuals (43% men, mean ± SD age 45 ± 13 years). Altogether 62% of the sample reported supplement use; 56% reported some vitamin or mineral and 27% reported non-vitamin and non-mineral supplement use. Supplement use was more frequent among women and those supplementing had better overall health. In the study sample, of the vitamins and minerals, vitamin D (45%) and magnesium (31%), respectively, were the most frequently reported. In the multivariable models, vitamin D supplementation was associated with better glycaemic control. 

Starting from a daily dose of ≥30 μg, there was evidence of improving glycaemic control with higher doses of supplemental vitamin D (e.g., for 30 μg: B <span>[Wald Confidence Internal]</span>, p-value, -2.76 <span>[-5.03 to -0.49]</span>, 0.017).

Conclusions: Supplement use was frequent in this sample of adult individuals with type 1 diabetes. Due to potential drug-supplement interactions, the attending physicians should be aware of their patients' supplement use. The causality between vitamin D supplementation and glycaemic control should be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

!!!!The use of dietary supplements, and the association between supplemental vitamin D and glycaemic control in adult individuals with type 1 diabetes

Aims: To assess the dietary supplement use in adult individuals with type 1 diabetes, and to study the association between vitamin D supplementation and glycaemic control in an observational cross-sectional study.

Methods: The study subjects were participants of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study. Data were included from all individuals with type 1 diabetes with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 , who had completed a diet questionnaire. In the questionnaire, the participants reported dietary supplement use for the past 30 days. A thorough investigation with an assessment of the blood panel was conducted at the study visit.

Results: Data were available from 1181 individuals (43% men, mean ± SD age 45 ± 13 years). Altogether 62% of the sample reported supplement use; 56% reported some vitamin or mineral and 27% reported non-vitamin and non-mineral supplement use. Supplement use was more frequent among women and those supplementing had better overall health. In the study sample, of the vitamins and minerals, vitamin D (45%) and magnesium (31%), respectively, were the most frequently reported. In the multivariable models, vitamin D supplementation was associated with better glycaemic control. 
Starting from a daily dose of ≥30 μg, there was evidence of improving glycaemic control with higher doses of supplemental vitamin D (e.g., for 30 μg: B [Wald Confidence Internal], p-value, -2.76 [-5.03 to -0.49], 0.017).

Conclusions: Supplement use was frequent in this sample of adult individuals with type 1 diabetes. Due to potential drug-supplement interactions, the attending physicians should be aware of their patients&#39; supplement use. The causality between vitamin D supplementation and glycaemic control should be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.
