I couldn&rsquo;t get up from my bed.</p></li><li><p>The roof seemed to be spinning really fast. It was horrible.</p></li><li><p>I started having trouble walking straight; problems to climb stairs&mldr;</p></li><li><p>And it was slowly getting worse.</p></li><li><p>It’s very complicated.</p></li><li><p>No family is prepared to deal with a chronic and progressive sickness affecting a beloved member.</p></li><li><p>In addition, specially in Brazil, people don’t know much about multiple sclerosis.</p></li><li><p>In multiple sclerosis, the nervous system is attacked by the immune system " The brain and the spinal cord.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, the patients might present virtually any neurologic symptoms.</p></li><li><p>It is estimated that there might be up to 50 thousand people affected in Brazil.</p></li><li><p>Mostly young people.</p></li><li><p>The disease may lead to blindness, paraplegia, being stuck to a wheelchair " very often evolve to a situation like that " from an early stage of life.</p></li><li><p>Until the final diagnosis I had been through 6 months of exams, medical monitoring and multiple corticoid therapies.</p></li><li><p>Diagnosed in 2009, began the <strong>vitamin D</strong> treatment a few months after that.</p></li><li><p>I was only able to identify that, effectively, it was a paralyzing disease.</p></li><li><p>Following the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, he spent many years using corticoids, which caused</p></li><li><p>a series of permanent side-effects.</p></li><li><p>He’s been using the <strong>vitamin D</strong> treatment for two years.</p></li><li><p>It was a really big shock.</p></li><li><p>I didn’t want to believe that I had it,specially since I didn&rsquo;t know anything about the disease or its treatment.</p></li><li><p>Diagnosed in 2006, began the <strong>vitamin D</strong> treatment in 2009.</p></li><li><p>Then I started reading about the disease, and realized that the perspective for a reasonable quality of life was small.</p></li><li><p>Chances are that you are going to get worse.</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s true anguish.</p></li><li><p>You think the worst. You feel that there is no hope,and you&rsquo;re scared that that things will continue to get worse soon, and you don’t know how to deal with it.</p></li><li><p>Multiple Sclerosis is usually treated with injected substances called interferons, that help to control the disease manifestations.</p></li><li><p>Several pharmaceutical companies compete in the market offering treatment with interferon and similar substances.</p></li><li><p>The monthly cost of the treatment with these drugs may reach over 5,000 US dollars per patient, being provided free of charge by the Brazilian health care system.</p></li><li><p>Interferon therapy reduces disease relapses by 30%, meaning that patients under that therapy still experience 70% of the relapses, and has major side-effects that lower the patient&rsquo;s quality of life.</p></li><li><p>It was a painful injection; it gave me headaches, indisposition; it was disturbing to think that every day you would eat breakfast and take another injection.</p></li><li><p>I took my first dose on June 3rd, 2003.</p></li><li><p>It was unforgettable, horrible; a huge suffering.</p></li><li><p>Had the first symptoms of the disease in 1977, but was diagnosed only in 2003.</p></li><li><p>She&rsquo;s been under high-dose <strong>vitamin D</strong> treatment since 2006.</p></li><li><p>I could feel each drop of that injection getting into each cell of my body&mldr; the whole night.</p></li><li><p>Actually, I became far worse when I started taking interferon.</p></li><li><p>Diagnosed in 2006, her neurological disabilities progressed until 2010, when she was about to be confined to a wheelchair.</p></li><li><p>She&rsquo;s been under <strong>vitamin D</strong> treatment for 5 months.</p></li><li><p>I couldn&rsquo;t particularly stand the pain of the injections.</p></li><li><p>At night time, I had to inject myself while in bed, because I couldn&rsquo;t move anymore afterwards.</p></li><li><p>Then the frequency of injections increased to 3 times per week.</p></li><li><p>Then I had no more rest&mldr;every other day I had to take another injection.</p></li><li><p>And I was getting persistently worse; I was about to use crutches, the left side of my body was compromised.</p></li><li><p>I endured this treatment for 3 months.</p></li><li><p>Then I gave up saying that I would rather let the disease take its course than having such treatment.</p></li><li><p>As far as I know, many people take the conventional treatment and keep getting worse.</p></li><li><p>Maybe slowly, but worse.</p></li><li><p>So I couldn&rsquo;t see any improvements.</p></li><li><p>Actually the traditional treatment gives you the impression that something changes in your body,but I couldn&rsquo;t see any benefit.</p></li><li><p>I got benefit from the treatment with <strong>vitamin D</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Studies on the effects of <strong>vitamin D</strong> on the immune system began around 40 years ago.</p></li><li><p>It was when the epidemiologists wanted to know the geographic distribution of autoimmune diseases around the globe.</p></li><li><p>They verified that close to the equator line there was a low prevalence of these diseases, and that the percentage of affected individuals increases proportionally with the distance from the equator.</p></li><li><p>Eventually, further research showed that this finding was related to lower exposure to solar radiation of people living in higher latitudes,leading to reduced production of <strong>vitamin D</strong> in the human skin - the major effect of solar exposure in our body.</p></li><li><p>My mother searched the internet and found an interview with Dr. Coimbra.</p></li><li><p>She scheduled an appointment for me. I was reluctant at first since I was tired of hearing the same things over and over again&mldr; but eventually I decided to attend, and it was the beginning of the good part of the story&mldr;</p></li><li><p>Approximately in 2003 we became aware of the medical obligation of not leaving those patients without due correction of <strong>vitamin D</strong> deficiency.</p></li><li><p>We verified, according to published literature data, that the recommended daily dose of <strong>200-600</strong> international units would not correct the level of deficiency found in these patients.</p></li><li><p>So we started employing more realistic (physiologically realistic) daily doses - like 10,000 units -</p></li><li><p>an amount easily achieved within a few minutes of solar exposure in adults.</p></li><li><p>And we noticed a remarkable clinical improvement in nearly all patients with autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>From this observation we come to further increase daily doses, trying to reach the highest level within the reference values,always supported by ancillary lab tests to ensure that no patient would have side effects, we observed that several of these individuals found themselves completely free of the manifestations of these autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>A few months after I started the <strong>vitamin D</strong> treatment, relapses became a lot less frequent.</p></li><li><p>Before that, I would have on average one relapse every 15 days.</p></li><li><p>In comparison to how it was before, the difference is extreme.</p></li><li><p>I feel much, much better; with respect to my mood, my outlook, hope&mldr;</p></li><li><p>First it was the fatigue;</p></li><li><p>I started feeling a disposition that I had not experienced in years.</p></li><li><p>Then I got the strength to move better, to write better, to hold a fork and a knife, to cut a slice of pizza&mldr;</p></li><li><p>For instance, before the treatment with <strong>vitamin D</strong> , when taking a bath I could not use shampoo to wash my hair, etc.</p></li><li><ul><li>For how long couldn&rsquo;t you do that sort of things?</li></ul></li><li><ul><li>During the time I was taking Interferon: from 2004 to 2010.</li></ul></li><li><p>And soon after I started taking <strong>vitamin D</strong> , <strong>within ten days, I was free of pain</strong> .</p></li><li><p>It was really impressive.</p></li><li><p>The pain was simply taken away from by body.</p></li><li><p>Gradually, within a 2-year period, all my disabilities disappeared.</p></li><li><p>All the neurological impairment I had on the left side of my body " particularly that of my left foot " was gone after that time period.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m a normal person now. I walk normally.</p></li><li><p>I have no limitations. Nothing at all.</p></li><li><p>Having spent all those years without hope,And then having this novel treatment, which is a simple one, inexpensive, provides effective results, and " most importantly " is free of adverse effects.</p></li><li><p>In contrast, the side effects of the traditional treatments were as burdensome as the disease itself.</p></li><li><p>There are quite extensive scientific data showing that the <strong>vitamin D</strong> deficiency is related to prostate, breast and intestinal cancers.</p></li><li><p>These cancers are much more common at higher latitudes.</p></li><li><p>There are prospective studies regarding this issue.</p></li><li><p>There are thousands of published studies on the effects of <strong>vitamin D</strong> on the best known and most frequent autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus. erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, vitiligo, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis, and several other diseases that remarkably reduce the quality of life of affected individuals.</p></li><li><p><strong>vitamin D</strong> makes your body react against the harmful effects of autoimmunity " in his case, rheumatism.</p></li><li><p>Leandro began to suffer from severe pain affecting multiple body regions in 2006 and went through repeated hospital admissions. Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, he started treatment with <strong>vitamin D</strong> in 2011.</p></li><li><p>We were skeptical at first, and yet, very sympathetically, he said at the end of the interview: â€˜Within six months you will forget about the pain.â€</p></li><li><p>We were so moved that both he and I were trying to hold back the tears.</p></li><li><p>I don&rsquo;t know if the doctor could understand why we were so moved.</p></li><li><p>That was because we used to go through enormous suffering at each relapse of his disease.</p></li><li><p>My wife, my daughter (his sister) and I " the whole family " suffered from his Suffering.</p></li><li><p>It was an unimaginable suffering.</p></li><li><p>During one of the hospitalizations I was given 12 shots of morphine.</p></li><li><p>After the twelfth shot I went into respiratory failure.</p></li><li><p>It is the kind of image that remains etched in one&rsquo;s memory forever. A son asking:“For God&rsquo;s sake, father, don&rsquo;t let me feel the pain anymore.”</p></li><li><p>Can you imagine walking this path for 5 years,</p></li><li><p>and not being able to find someone or something that could make it stop?</p></li><li><p>The treatment with <strong>vitamin D</strong> in fact relieved me from pain, made me feel better, and allowed me to return to normal life.</p></li><li><p>I estimate that after 5 months of treatment I already felt a lot better.</p></li><li><p>I almost forgot about some of the problems I had.</p></li><li><p>Today I have a good perspective,I will keep on with my life, everything will be all right&mldr;</p></li><li><p>I want to get married within two or three years,I&rsquo;ll have my children. I&rsquo;ll have my own home. I&rsquo;ll take my life.</p></li><li><p><strong>vitamin D</strong> is essentially produced in the skin, and becomes biologically active by being transformed into a hormone.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, <strong>vitamin D</strong> is more appropriately classified as a pro-hormone.</p></li><li><p>There are two ways of replenishing <strong>vitamin D</strong> :either by ingestion (in liquid form or capsules) or by exposure to sunlight.</p></li><li><p>There are studies of fundamental importance concerning the <strong>vitamin D</strong> issue.</p></li><li><p>One of the pioneers in this matter is Dr. Michael Holick, who discovered the circulating form of <strong>vitamin D</strong> suitable for assessment of <strong>vitamin D</strong> deficiency " the 25-hydroxy <strong>vitamin D</strong> 3.</p></li><li><p>Even though we have natural sources for all of the vitamins in general, vitamins are also chemically synthesized.</p></li><li><p><strong>vitamin D</strong> is not synthesized in Brazil yet, <strong>vitamin D</strong> synthesized in Italy is considered one of the best, and currently supplies the domestic market.</p></li><li><p>Updated data indicate that <strong>vitamin D</strong> deficiency is now a worldwide pandemic.</p></li><li><p>Because <strong>vitamin D</strong> is essentially produced by sunlight exposure which is now quite restricted, specially in modern urban centers " where people live and work in confined spaces.</p></li><li><p>Current estimates indicate that approximately 50% of the general population has low levels of <strong>vitamin D</strong> .</p></li><li><p>I have been surfing for a quite long time.</p></li><li><p>Surfing has become the major driving force of my life.</p></li><li><p>from the initial manifestations of MS, most people become handicapped to the point of not being able to deal with their domestic activities.</p></li><li><p>That being so, what about surfing, a sport demanding strength, balance, physical resistance?</p></li><li><p>I realized that I had little time left to continue surfing, and that was quite anguishing.</p></li><li><p>That was indeed the worst feeling – the feeling from knowing that maybe I would be alive, young,but unable to surf or practice sports.</p></li><li><p>The doctor told me to avoid sunlight exposure and physical activity.</p></li><li><p>Gosh! I wanted to surf, right, dude? But then, how could I possibly do that or even go to the beach?</p></li><li><p>Then I went to see Dr. Coimbra and he said:";No, dude.

Barely spoke in MS.</p><h3 id=sueliuliano-1-month-ago>sueliuliano 1 month ago</h3><p>Hello deficiency of vitamin D causes, yes, muscle aches. Try examination 25 (OH) D3 and makes supplementation with realistic doses, if any.</p><p><strong>_Ideally take 10,000 IU per day for at least 2 months</strong> _.</p><h3 id=eliane-langer-1-month-ago-1>Eliane Langer 1 month ago</h3><p>I have muscle pain =&rsquo;m too sedentary. Already repus vit. D and nothing has changed, not &mldr; I&rsquo;ve done this exam 2X, I&rsquo;m the 3rd to do. Q Only neuro who was not indicated, but gynecologist &mldr;. People have a habit of finding all q q occurs in the body is to rise to MS. No, we have to consider the whole body. And of course, in winter / cold / cloudy, levels of vit.

Unfortunately, Eliane after 10 years with the disease are rare cases that do not suffer from severe limitations. And me too revolting attitudes like yours that seek to sow distrust around a serious work with precious results.</p><hr><h2 id=doctors-that-administer-vitamin-d-from-the-blog-march-2013>Doctors that administer Vitamin D {from the blog March 2013}</h2><h3 id=dr-cícero-galli-coimbra>Dr. Cícero Galli Coimbra</h3><p>Expertise: Neurology, City: São Paulo/SP – Brazil, Address: Rua Diogo de Faria, 775 conj. 94 – Phone: (+5511) 5908-5969</p><h3 id=dr-danilo-chiaradia-finamor>Dr. Danilo Chiaradia Finamor</h3><p>Expertise: Dermatology, City: São Paulo/SP – Brazil, Addresses:</p><ul><li>Rua Nuporanga, 77 – Phone: (11) 5082-1013; - Rua Diogo de Faria, 775 conj. 94 – Phone: (+5511) 5908-5969</li></ul><h3 id=dr-sergio-menendez-lucero>Dr. Sergio Menendez Lucero</h3><p>Expertise: General Practioner, City: São Paulo/SP – Brazil, Address: Rua Diogo de Faria, 775, conj. 94 – Phone: (+5511) 5908-5969</p><h1 id=doctors-that-had-access-to-dr-cícero-coimbras-protocol-and-are-treating-patients-with-higher-doses-of-vitamina-d>Doctors that had access to Dr. Cícero Coimbra’s protocol and are treating patients with higher doses of Vitamina D:</h1><h3 id=dr-sílvio-laganá>Dr. Sílvio Laganá</h3><p>Expertise: Nutrition, City: São Paulo/SP – Brazil.

I understand that you are expecting this contact.</p><p>I am pleased to know that you are not entirely skeptical about the spontaneous testimonies of several MS (or, I dare to say, ex-MS)</p><p>patients from different countries. I praise your ethical concern about avoiding unfounded dismissal and skepticism on a potentially</p><p>fundamental information for the treatment of such a terrible disease like MS - which has so far condemned to a wheelchair and blindness a</p><p>large number of (often young) patients worldwide.</p><p>Yes, I am a legitimate neurologist in Brazil. I had part of my medical training at the Jackson Memorial Hospital, University of Miami back in</p><p>the middle eighties, and research training at the Laboratory for Brain Research (Hjärnforskning), University of Lund, Sweden, back in the early nineties.</p><p>I have been interested in the potential therapeutic value of high daily doses vitamin D for the last 11 years. To achieve maximal</p><p>control of autoimmunity in MS patients, I have dared to use progressively higher doses of cholecalciferol associated with</p><p>preventive measures (basically a low-calcium diet plus abundant hydration) against hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. I believe I could</p><p>develop a method of setting the fully or nearly fully effective daily dose for each patient based on laboratory tests.</p><p><strong>Yes, recent but not old demyelinating lesions appeared partially repaired or disappeared on MRI scans</strong> after one and two years of</p><p>treatment. Similarly, patients <strong>partially or fully recovered from recent</strong> but not from old disabilities during the first 2 years of</p><p>treatment. At this point, I do not regard the result of this therapeutic protocol as a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; but rather as a <strong>method of inducing</strong></p><p><strong>remission of MS</strong> for as long as the patient sustains his/her individually established daily dose.</p><p>For the benefit of the large number of MS patients worldwide, I would gladly open my office and records (as well as those of my medical</p><p>team) for both retrospective and prospective observations from whoever wishes to receive or witness more consistent information.</p><p>Yours, <strong>Cicero G Coimbra</strong> , MD, PHD Internal Medicine and Neurology Lab of Neuropathology & Neuroprotection,</p><p>head Associate Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience Federal University of São Paulo</p><p>UNIFESP Rua Pedro de Toledo 781 - 7th floor 04039-032 - São Paulo - SP - Brazil <a href=mailto:coimbracg@gmail.com>coimbracg@gmail.com</a></p><p><strong><span style=color:#090>short url for the page = </span></strong><a href=http://is.gd/brazilvitd>http://is.gd/brazilvitd</a></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>autoimmune</span>
