Background

Falls are a serious problem among frail elderly and their prevention is an important health concern. We compared the frequency of falls among institutionalized frail elderly residents following different interventions: low-frequency exercise, vitamin D supplementation, and a combination of both.

Methods

Participants (N = 91) were residents in an institution for frail elderly (84.8 ± 8.8 years of age, 69 women). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) the control group (n = 23) was provided three sessions per week of individualized exercise and usual care, (2) the low-exercise group (n = 22) was provided two sessions of individualized exercise per week, (3) the nutrition group (n = 23) was given oral vitamin D (900 IU/day), and (4) the combined group (n = 23) performed low-level exercise and received vitamin D supplementation.

Results

A two-way analysis of variance including interactions between experimental group and time indicated a clear benefit in the groups that received supplementation with vitamin D. A Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis, adjusted for sex and age, showed that compared to the control group, the combined group had a reduced risk of falls (hazard ratio: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08–0.92, P < 0.05). The other groups did not significantly differ from controls.

Conclusion

The intervention combining low-frequency exercise and vitamin D supplementation was effective for the reduction of falls among institutionalized frail elderly individuals.
