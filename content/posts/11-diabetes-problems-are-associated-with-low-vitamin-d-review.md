Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are public health concerns that have contributed to multiple negative health outcomes. Recent studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency influence glycaemic control and the development of diabetes complications. 

The goal of this systematic review is to summarise the latest evidence on the impact of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency on the outcome of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. In this PRISMA-guided systematic review, articles were sourced from three databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. 

The review only included literature published from 2012 until 2022, and  **33 eligible studies**  met the inclusion criteria for this review. The included articles were critically appraised using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT).

According to our findings, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with 

* mental health status, 

* macrovascular and microvascular complications of T2DM, 

* metabolic syndrome, 

* increased risk of obesity,

* increased blood pressure, 

* dyslipidaemia, 

* glycaemic control, 

* nerve-related disease, 

* musculoskeletal-related complications, and 

* reduced quality of life. 

Due to the diverse implications of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, screening for vitamin D levels in T2DM patients may be beneficial.
