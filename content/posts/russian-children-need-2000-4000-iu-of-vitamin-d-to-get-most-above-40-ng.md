Clinical trial of Vitamin D supplementation of Russin children at a variety of latitudes

Goal to get ALL children >30 ng seemed to get most >40 ng

&nbsp; &nbsp; see&nbsp;  [Perhaps half of Russian children have rickets, 500 IU vitamin D was not enough â€“ June 2013](/posts/perhaps-half-of-russian-children-have-rickets-500-iu-vitamin-d-was-not-enough)

Doseage was based on how deficient each child was to start with

500 IU was inadequate

Interestingly, almost half of children who needed only 1,000 IU actually got a DECREASE in vitamin D levels

The study did not enroll those with mal-absorption problems nor rickets

Strangely the trial lasted for only 1 month. but often times a vitamin D level may not plateau until 6 months
