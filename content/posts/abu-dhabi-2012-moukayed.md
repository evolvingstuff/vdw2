#### The Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Vitamin D Action

Cholecalciferol, 1 D, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , is a biologically important molecule for the physiological functions of several target tissues in the human body. 

In this presentation, the production, metabolism and mechanisms of action of 1 D, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 will be discussed. 

The genomic mechanisms of 1 D, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 action via the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and non-genomic mechanisms of action will be explained. 

The molecular cross talk between 1 D, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 signalling pathways and that of other growth factors or hormones will be discussed 

to elucidate the central involvement of 1 D, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival.
