During 19 months, 117 patients were included. Their median 25-OHD was 45 nmol/l; considerably lower than published reports on Swedish healthy populations. Only 14.5% had recommended levels (over 75). In 56.4%, 25-OHD was under 50 nmol/l, which is related to several unfavourable health outcomes.</p><p>Seasonal variation of 25-OHD was blunted. Patients with ADHD had unexpectedly low iPTH levels. Middle East, South-East Asian or African ethnic origin, being a young male and having a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia predicted low 25-OHD levels. Hence, the diagnoses that have been hypothetically linked to developmental (prenatal) vitamin D deficiency, schizophrenia and autism, had the lowest 25-OHD levels in this adult sample, supporting the notion that vitamin D deficiency may not only be a predisposing developmental factor but also relate to the adult patients’ psychiatric state. This is further supported by the considerable psychiatric improvement that coincided with vitamin D treatment in some of the patients whose deficiency was treated.</p><hr><p><a href=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01169142>Clinical Trial using 50,000 IU of vitamin D weekly to treat Schizophrenia</a> Completion date Dec 2012</p><hr><h3 id=vitamin-d-is-it-ready-for-psychiatric-prime-time>Vitamin D: Is It Ready for Psychiatric Prime Time?</h3><p>Psychopharm Review: September 2010 - Volume 45 - Issue 9 - p 67–73</p><p>Very provocative title, no abstract</p><hr><h3 id=vitamin-d-does-it-play-a-role-in-psychiatry>Vitamin D: Does it play a role in psychiatry?</h3><p>Journal of Pakistan Medican Association, February, 2012</p><p>Mukesh Mohan Bhimani ( Department of Psychiatry, Aga Khan University, Karachi. )</p><p>Brief answer – possibly</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p><hr><h3 id=seasonal-distribution-of-psychiatric-births-in-england>Seasonal Distribution of Psychiatric Births in England</h3><p>Plos1 April 2012</p><p>Giulio Disanto1,2, Julia M.

We studied vitamin D status in an unselected sample of adult psychiatric inpatients in Hamilton (latitude 37.5?S) during late winter.</p><p>Methods: We recruited 102 consenting subjects and measured 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels in venous blood using a competitive electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used one-sample t-tests to determine the extent to which ethnic and diagnostic subgroups fell below the vitamin D deficiency threshold of 50 nM.</p><p>Results: 75 subjects (74%) had vitamin D levels &lt;50 nM and thus had at least mild deficiency, while 19 (19%) were severely deficient with levels &lt;25 nM. Rates of deficiency were comparable for men and women; only the former showed a correlation of vitamin D levels with age (r?=?0.45, p?&lt;?0.01). Maori participants constituted half the sample (n?=?51) and were more likely to be deficient than their European counterparts (p?=?0.04). Vitamin D also varied by diagnosis, with schizophrenia associated with markedly lower levels than mania and depression (p?&lt;?0.001).</p><p>Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the psychiatric inpatient setting in New Zealand and may be relevant to poor physical health outcomes, notably among Maori and those with schizophrenia. These findings support proposals to provide vitamin D supplementation, particularly during the winter months.</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p><hr><h3 id=feasibility-of-screening-for-and-treating-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-forensic-psychiatric-inpatients>Feasibility of screening for and treating vitamin D deficiency in forensic psychiatric inpatients.</h3><p>J Forensic Leg Med. 2012 Nov;19(8):457-64. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jflm.2012.04.003.>doi: 10.1016/j.jflm.2012.04.003.</a> Epub 2012 May 4.</p><p>Murie J, Messow CM, Fitzpatrick B.</p><p>NHS Scotland State Hospital and NHS Education for Scotland, 2 Central Quay, Glasgow G3 8BW, United Kingdom.

Of the 33 inpatients (40% selected; 21% of hospital population) completing this cross-sectional study, 36% had insufficient and 58% deficient vitamin D. Five patients with vitamin D deficiency had secondary hyperparathyroidism, two of whom had osteopenia on dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry. At 1-year follow up, of the 31 patients eligible, 15 had accepted and continued supplements. Systematic screening is therefore necessary due to mental health and consent issues. Implications of supplementation and grounds access are discussed.</p><p>Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Vitamin D is crucial not only for bone health but for proper brain development and functioning. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with depression, seasonal affective disorder, and schizophrenia in adults, but little is known about vitamin D and mental health in the pediatric population.</p><p>METHODS: One hundred four adolescents presenting for acute mental health treatment over a 16-month period were assessed for vitamin D status and the relationship of 25-OH vitamin D levels to severity of illness, defined by presence of psychotic features.</p><p>RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D levels &lt;20?ng/ml) was present in 34%; vitamin D insufficiency (25-OH D levels 20-30?ng/ml) was present in 38%, with a remaining 28% in the normal range. Adolescents with psychotic features had lower vitamin D levels (20.4?ng/ml vs. 24.7?ng/ml; p?=?0.04, 1 df). The association for vitamin D deficiency and psychotic features was substantial (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4-8.9; p &lt;0.009). Race was independently associated with vitamin D deficiency and independently associated with psychosis for those who were Asian or biracial vs. white (OR?=?3.8; 95% CI 1.1?13.4; p?&lt;?0.04). Race was no longer associated with psychosis when the results were adjusted for vitamin D level.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are both highly prevalent in adolescents with severe mental illness. The preliminary associations between vitamin D deficiency and presence of psychotic features warrant further investigation as to whether vitamin D deficiency is a mediator of illness severity, result of illness severity, or both. Higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency but no greater risk of psychosis in African Americans, if confirmed, may have special implications for health disparity and treatment outcome research.</p><p>PMID: 22571731 <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22571731%20><strong><span style=color:red>Full text online</span></strong></a></p><hr><h3 id=vitamin-d-status-of-psychiatric-inpatients-in-new-zealands-waikato-region-1>Vitamin D status of psychiatric inpatients in New Zealand&rsquo;s Waikato region.</h3><p>BMC Psychiatry. 2012 Jun 26;12:68.</p><p>Menkes DB, Lancaster K, Grant M, Marsh RW, Dean P, du Toit SA.</p><p>Waikato Clinical School, Private Bag 3200, Hamilton, 3240, New Zealand. <a href=mailto:david.menkes@waikatodhb.health.nz>david.menkes@waikatodhb.health.nz</a></p><p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in New Zealand, confers multiple health risks, and may be particularly common among people with psychiatric illness.

All participants and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. Primary outcome measures assessed at baseline and 6 weeks were working memory, response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Secondary outcomes were: hallucination-proneness, psychotic-like experiences, and ratings of depression, anxiety and anger. 128 participants were recruited, randomised and included in primary analyses (vitamin D n = 63; placebo n = 65). Despite significant increases in vitamin D status in the active group, no significant changes were observed in working memory (F = 1.09; p = 0.30), response inhibition (F = 0.82; p = 0.37), cognitive flexibility (F = 1.37; p = 0.24) or secondary outcomes.

It has other physiological functions, and there are plausible reasons for investigating vitamin D in depressive disorders.
