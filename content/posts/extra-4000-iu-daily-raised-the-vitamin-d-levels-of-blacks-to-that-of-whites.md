Background: African Americans suffer disproportionately from diabetes and cardiovascular disease and are significantly more likely to have suboptimal concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>. 

The results of epidemiologic and observational studies suggest that there is a link between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of cardiometabolic disorders, which underscores the importance of maintaining healthy concentrations of 25(OH)D.

Objective: The objective was to investigate whether daily supplementation with 4000 IU vitamin D3 for 1 y would eliminate any disparities in circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men.

Design: Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured every 2 mo in 47 subjects who received a daily oral dose of 4000 IU vitamin D3 for 1 y.

Results: More than 90% of African Americans had serum concentrations of 25(OH)D <32 ng/mL, and approximately two-thirds had serum concentrations <20 ng/mL. Furthermore, there were significant disparities in serum concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men. 

Supplementation with 4000 IU/d for 1 y eliminated any significant differences in circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men.

Conclusion: The results of this clinical study show the feasibility and efficacy of this approach in the elimination of hypovitaminosis D, which is a widespread health disparity among African Americans. 

This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as [NCT01045109](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01045109)

Background: African Americans suffer disproportionately from diabetes and cardiovascular disease and are significantly more likely to have suboptimal concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. 
The results of epidemiologic and observational studies suggest that there is a link between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of cardiometabolic disorders, which underscores the importance of maintaining healthy concentrations of 25(OH)D.

Objective: The objective was to investigate whether daily supplementation with 4000 IU vitamin D3 for 1 y would eliminate any disparities in circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men.

Design: Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured every 2 mo in 47 subjects who received a daily oral dose of 4000 IU vitamin D3 for 1 y.

Results: More than 90% of African Americans had serum concentrations of 25(OH)D &lt;32 ng/mL, and approximately two-thirds had serum concentrations &lt;20 ng/mL. Furthermore, there were significant disparities in serum concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men. 
Supplementation with 4000 IU/d for 1 y eliminated any significant differences in circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men.

Conclusion: The results of this clinical study show the feasibility and efficacy of this approach in the elimination of hypovitaminosis D, which is a widespread health disparity among African Americans. 
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01045109|NCT01045109]

This Clinical Trial was for__~~#F00: Prostate Cancer~~__, so will have elderly men. 
No information about amount needed for obese, younger, other latitudes, women, etc.
!!!!Comment on Fig 1: While the body may be consuming lots of vitamin D that 2 months after getting 4,000 IU per day
1) About 30% of whites had  &lt; 20 ng increase in vitamin D levels
2) A few whites had &lt; 5 ng increase or even a decrease in their vitamin D levels
3) Most blacks got more of a response than whites - 20-30 ng increase
4) Most blacks started with lower vitamin D levels (as expected)
!!!!Comment on Fig 2
#Yes, black and whites ended up with similar distribution of vitamin D level
# Wonder why the vitamin D levels dropped significantly toward the end of the year
+Stop taking the vitamin D?
