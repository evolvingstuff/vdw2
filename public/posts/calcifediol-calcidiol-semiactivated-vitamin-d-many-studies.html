It is more effective for individuals with certain conditions, such as liver disease or malabsorption issues, because it bypasses the liver&rsquo;s 25-hydroxylation process. This makes it more efficient in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels. Additionally, calcifediol is preferred when a rapid increase in vitamin D levels is required, such as in acute situations like early stages of COVID-19. However, for regular supplementation in healthy individuals without specific conditions, cholecalciferol is often adequate and more cost-effective.</p><p><strong>2) Is there a faster response to calcifediol ?</strong></p><p>Calcifediol provides a faster response in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels compared to cholecalciferol. This is particularly relevant for patients requiring a rapid increase in vitamin D levels, such as in acute cases or in those with certain medical conditions like liver disease or malabsorption issues. Calcifediol&rsquo;s efficacy in rapidly elevating vitamin D levels makes it a preferred option in specific clinical scenarios where immediate therapeutic effects are desired.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol-jan-2024-compresspdf.pdf>The PDF given to Chat-GPT - if you wish to ask another question</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=response-to-weekly-calcidiol---rct-feb-2025>Response to weekly Calcidiol - RCT Feb 2025</h4><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/calcifediol-weekly.webp alt=image width=600><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calfideodial-weekly-rct.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=calcidiol-prescription-typically-needed-expensive-might-be-fast>Calcidiol: Prescription typically needed, expensive, might be fast</h4><ul><li><p>Calcidiol supplementation may be be essential to get Vitamin D if there is poor liver function</p></li><li><p>Calcidiol is far more expensive than Vitamin D</p></li><li><p>Fast Vitamin D response is essential in some cases - such as early COVID</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>It appears that Calcidiol provides a fast response (mixed indications)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Nanoemulsion Vitamin D might also provide a quick response - personal observation, no data yet.</p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=weekly-calcifediol-improved-vitamin-d-levels-in-hiv-patients-but-not-at-other-dosing-intervals----dec-2024>Weekly Calcifediol improved Vitamin D levels in HIV patients (but not at other dosing intervals) - Dec 2024</h4><p><strong>Effectiveness of supplementation with different doses of calcifediol in HIV patients with vitamin D deficiency</strong></p><p>Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiología Clínica <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eimc.2024.11.0>partial PDF</a> Spain</p><p>Background</p><p>People with HIV (PWH) often exhibit vitamin D deficiency, with ambiguous treatment guidelines.

The aim of this study was to assess monthly calcifediol treatments for vitamin D deficiency (or biweekly, if the deficiency was severe) in a young adult population with no associated comorbidities. This multicentre phase I trial started with a four month open-label treatment phase (TP) that included 101 participants (65% women with mean age 29.8 years). Eighty-two percent of the subjects (79/96) achieved 25(OH)D levels within the target range (20–60 ng/mL) by the end of the TP, and they were subsequently randomised and subjected to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, five month follow-up phase (FP). At the end of the FP, 89% of participants maintained vitamin D levels of >20 ng/mL with calcifediol, versus 49% with placebo (p &lt; 0.001). Subjects receiving monthly calcifediol during both phases (n = 32) maintained 25(OH)D levels >20 ng/mL, whereas those on the placebo during the FP (n = 38) exhibited deficiency levels of 25(OH)D by the end of the study. No clinically relevant changes in bone metabolism parameters or toxic 25(OH)D levels were observed, and no serious adverse events were reported throughout the study. Calcifediol is a safe and effective treatment for vitamin D deficiency in the young adult population, but long-term use may be required to sustain optimal 25(OH)D levels.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/poscal-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>13% of Adverse Events were due to the supplementation (clipped from PDF)</strong></p><p>During the study, 66 AEs were reported by approximately one-third (n = 36, 36%)</p><p>of the safety population (n = 101).

In our comparative review of the two exogenous vitamin D supplementation options most used in our care setting, we found that cholecalciferol has more scientific evidence with positive results than calcifediol in musculoskeletal diseases and that it is the form of vitamin D of choice in the most accepted and internationally recognized clinical guidelines on the management of osteoporosis. Cholecalciferol, unlike calcifediol, guarantees an exact dosage in IU (International Units) of vitamin D and has pharmacokinetic properties that allow either daily or even weekly, fortnightly, or monthly administration in its equivalent doses, which can facilitate adherence to treatment. Regardless of the pattern of administration, cholecalciferol may be more likely to achieve serum levels of 25(OH)D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) of 30-50 ng/mL, an interval considered optimal for maximum benefit at the lowest risk. In summary, the form of vitamin D of choice for exogenous supplementation should be cholecalciferol, with calcifediol reserved for patients with liver failure or severe intestinal malabsorption syndromes.</p><p><strong>Conclusions (clipped from PDF)</strong></p><p>Based on our current knowledge, treatment of vitamin D deficiency should be aimed to maintain</p><p>stable and continuous serum levels of 25(OH)D in a range of approximately 30 to 50 ng/mL,</p><p>which appears to be optimal in terms of maximizing benefits and minimizing risks of vitamin</p><p>D, regardless of the myriad of genetic and/or environmental factors that may influence the vitamin D</p><p>status of patients.</p><p>In our opinion, and based on the available scientific evidence, cholecalciferol is the form of vitamin</p><p>D that can ensure that the vast majority of patients with vitamin D deficiency are within the optimal</p><p>range of efficacy and safety in a long-term period.</p><p>Therefore, based on our review of differential pharmacological characteristics and scientific</p><p>evidence, cholecalciferol should be used and prescribed in the majority of vitamin D deficiency clinical</p><p>settings instead of calcifediol.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/management-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=calcifediol-25oh-vitamin-d3-deficiency-a-risk-factor-from-early-to-old-age---march-2022>Calcifediol (25OH Vitamin D3) Deficiency: A Risk Factor from Early to Old Age - March 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022 Mar 10;14(6):1168. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14061168.>doi: 10.3390/nu14061168.</a></p><p>Roger Bouillon 1, Leen Antonio 1 2, Oscar Rosero Olarte 3</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is the main cause of nutritional rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. There is consensus that nutritional access to vitamin D can be estimated by measuring serum concentrations of 25OHD and vitamin D deficiency can thus be considered as calcifediol deficiency.</p><p>However, the threshold for vitamin D/calcifediol sufficiency remains a matter of debate.</p><p>Vitamin D/calcifediol deficiency has been associated with musculoskeletal effects but also multiple adverse extra-skeletal consequences. If these consequences improve or if they can be treated with vitamin D supplementation is still unclear. Observational studies suggest a higher infection risk in people with low calcifediol levels. There is also a consistent association between serum calcifediol and cardiovascular events and deaths, but large-scale, long-term intervention studies did not show any benefit on cardiovascular outcomes from supplementation, at least not in subjects without clear vitamin D deficiency. Cancer risk also did not change with vitamin D treatment, although there are some data that higher serum calcifediol is associated with longer survival in cancer patients. In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and low birth weight. Although preclinical studies showed that the vitamin D endocrine system plays a role in certain neural cells as well as brain structure and function, there is no evidence to support a beneficial effect of vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases. Vitamin D supplementation may marginally affect overall mortality risk especially in elderly subjects with low serum calcifediol concentrations.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/march-2022-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=calcifediol-prescription-may-be-a-good-but-expensive-way-to-correct-vitamin-d-deficiency---june-2023>Calcifediol prescription may be a good, but expensive way to correct Vitamin D deficiency - June 2023</h4><p><strong>Calcifediol: a review of its pharmacological characteristics and clinical use in correcting vitamin D deficiency</strong></p><p>Eur J Nutr . 2023 Jun;62(4):1579-1597. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-023-03103-1>doi: 10.1007/s00394-023-03103-1</a></p><p>Esteban Jodar 1, Claudia Campusano 2, Renate T de Jongh 3, Michael F Holick 4</p><p>Background: In addition to the role of vitamin D in bone mineralization, calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and skeletal health, evidence suggests an association between vitamin D deficiency and a wide range of chronic conditions. This is of clinical concern given the substantial global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency has traditionally been treated with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).

Adults affected with hypovitaminosis D could experience negative consequences on their musculoskeletal system and extra-skeletal health. In fact, an optimal vitamin D status is essential to ensure the correct bone, calcium, and phosphate homeostasis. To improve vitamin D status, it is important to not only increase the intake of food fortified with vitamin D, but also to administer vitamin D supplementation when required. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the most widely used supplement. In recent years, the administration of calcifediol (25(OH)D3), the direct precursor of the biologically active form of vitamin D3, as oral vitamin D supplementation has progressively grown. Here, we report the potential medical benefits of some peculiar biological actions of calcifediol, discussing the possible specific clinical scenarios in which the oral intake of calcifediol could be most effective to restore the correct serum levels of 25(OH)D3. In summary, the aim of this review is to provide insights into calcifediol-related rapid non-genomic responses and the possible use of this vitamin D metabolite as a supplement for the treatment of people with a higher risk of hypovitaminosis D.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol---why-when-how-much-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-endocrine-system-and-covid-19---treatment-with-calcifediol--june-2022>Vitamin D Endocrine System and COVID-19 - Treatment with Calcifediol – June 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(13), 2716; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14132716>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14132716</a></p><p>by Jose Manuel Quesada-Gomez 1,2,<em>,José Lopez-Miranda 1,3,4ORCID,Marta Entrenas-Castillo 5,Antonio Casado-Díaz 1,2,6ORCID,Xavier Nogues y Solans 2,7ORCID,José Luis Mansur 8ORCID and Roger Bouillon 9,</em></p><p><strong>The immune system need a good Vitamin D Receptor</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/vdr-essential-for-immune-systm-to-operate.jpg alt=image width=900><p><strong>Response to Calcifediol</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/calci-response.jpg alt=image width=600><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest challenge facing modern medicine and public health systems. The viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with the emergence of new variants with in-creased infectious potential, is a cause for concern. In addition, vaccination coverage remains in-sufficient worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to develop new therapeutic options, and/or to optimize the repositioning of drugs approved for other indications for COVID-19. This may include the use of calcifediol, the prohormone of the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES) as it may have potential useful effects for the treatment of COVID-19. We review the aspects associating COVID-19 with VDES and the potential use of calcifediol in COVID-19. VDES/VDR stimulation may enhance innate antiviral effector mechanisms, facilitating the induction of antimicrobial peptides/autophagy, with a critical modulatory role in the subsequent host reactive hyperinflammatory phase during COVID-19: By decreasing the cytokine/chemokine storm, regulating the renin–angiotensin–bradykinin system (RAAS), modulating neutrophil activity and maintaining the integrity of the pulmonary epithelial barrier, stimulating epithelial repair, and directly and indirectly decreasing the increased coagulability and prothrombotic tendency associated with severe COVID-19 and its complications. Available evidence suggests that VDES/VDR stimulation, while maintaining optimal serum 25OHD status, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may significantly reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe COVID-19, with possible beneficial effects on the need for mechanical ventilation and/or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, as well as deaths in the course of the disease. The pharmacokinetic and functional characteristics of calcifediol give it superiority in rapidly optimizing 25OHD levels in COVID-19. A pilot study and several observational intervention studies using high doses of calcifediol (0.532 mg on day 1 and 0.266 mg on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) dramatically decreased the need for ICU admission and the mortality rate.</p><p>We, therefore, propose to use calcifediol at the doses described for the rapid correction of 25OHD deficiency in all patients in the early stages of COVID-19, in association, if necessary, with the new oral antiviral agents.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol-and-covid.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=calcifediol-for-use-in-treatment-of-respiratory-disease---june-2022>Calcifediol for Use in Treatment of Respiratory Disease - June 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(12), 2447; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122447>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122447</a></p><p>by Marta Entrenas-Castillo 1,2,Lourdes Salinero-González 3,Luis M. Entrenas-Costa 1,2,4 andRubén Andújar-Espinosa 5,6,*</p><p>Calcifediol is the prohormone of the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES). It requires hydroxylation to move to 1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol, the active form that exerts its functions by activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that is expressed in many organs, including the lungs. Due to its rapid oral absorption and because it does not require first hepatic hydroxylation, it is a good option to replace the prevalent deficiency of vitamin D (25 hydroxyvitamin D; 25OHD), to which patients with respiratory pathologies are no strangers. Correcting 25OHD deficiency can decrease the risk of upper respiratory infections and thus improve asthma and COPD control. The same happens with other respiratory pathologies and, in particular, COVID-19. Calcifediol may be a good option for raising 25OHD serum levels quickly because the profile of inflammatory cytokines exhibited by patients with inflammatory respiratory diseases, such as asthma, COPD or COVID-19, can increase the degradation of the active metabolites of the VDES. The aim of this narrative revision is to report the current evidence on the role of calcifediol in main respiratory diseases. In conclusion, good 25OHD status may have beneficial effects on the clinical course of respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. This hypothesis should be confirmed in large, randomized trials. Otherwise, a rapid correction of 25(OH)D deficiency can be useful for patients with respiratory disease.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol-for-use-in-treatment-of-respiratory-disease-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=treatment-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-with-calcifediol-efficacy-and-safety-profile-and-predictability-of-efficacy---may-2022>Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency with Calcifediol: Efficacy and Safety Profile and Predictability of Efficacy - May 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(9), 1943; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091943>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091943</a></p><p>by Jose-Luis Pérez-Castrillon 1,*,Ricardo Usategui-Martín 2,3 andPawel Pludowski 4ORCID</p><p>1 Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario Río Hortega, University of Valladolid, 47012 Valladolid, Spain</p><p>2 Department of Cell Biology, Histology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Valladolid, 47003 Valladolid, Spain</p><p>3 IOBA, University of Valladolid, 47011 Valladolid, Spain</p><p>4 Department of Biochemistry, Radioimmunology and Experimental Medicine, The Children’s Memorial Health Institute, 04730 Warsaw, Poland</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/safety-short-term.jpg alt=image width=1000>

It is used to prevent and treat vitamin D deficiency. Calcifediol, as well as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), is efficient and safe in the general population, although calcifediol has certain advantages over cholecalciferol, such as its rapid onset of action and greater potency. This review analyzed studies comparing the efficacy and safety of both calcifediol and cholecalciferol drugs in the short and long term (>6 months). Calcifediol was found to be more efficacious, with no increase in toxicity. We also assessed the predictability of both molecules. A 25OHD increase depends on the dose and frequency of calcifediol administration. In contrast, after cholecalciferol administration, 25OHD increase depends on more factors than dose and frequency of administration, also phenotypic aspects (such as obesity and malabsorption), and genotypic factors impacts in this increase.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/efficay-and-safety-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=25ohvitamin-d-deficiency-and-calcifediol-treatment-in-pediatrics---april-2022>25(OH)Vitamin D Deficiency and Calcifediol Treatment in Pediatrics - April 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(9), 1854; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091854>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091854</a></p><p>by Luis Castano *,Leire MadariagaORCID,Gema Grau andAlejandro García-Castaño</p><p>Cruces University Hospital, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, UPV/EHU, CIBERER/CIBERDEM, Endo-ERN, 48903 Barakaldo, Spain</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/calcifediol-pediatrics.jpg alt=image width=700><p>Vitamin D is essential for the normal mineralization of bones during childhood. Although diet and adequate sun exposure should provide enough of this nutrient, there is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency rickets worldwide. Children with certain conditions that lead to decreased vitamin D production and/or absorption are at the greatest risk of nutritional rickets. In addition, several rare genetic alterations are also associated with severe forms of vitamin-D-resistant or -dependent rickets. Although vitamin D3 is the threshold nutrient for the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES), direct measurement of circulating vitamin D3 itself is not a good marker of the nutritional status of the system. Calcifediol (or 25(OH)D) serum levels are used to assess VDES status. While there is no clear consensus among the different scientific associations on calcifediol status, many clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of ensuring normal 25(OH)D serum levels and calcium intake for the prevention or treatment of nutritional rickets in childhood. Therefore, during the first year of life, infants should receive vitamin D treatment with at least 400 IU/day. In addition, a diet should ensure a normal calcium intake. Healthy lifestyle habits to prevent vitamin D deficiency should be encouraged during childhood. In children who develop clinical signs of rickets, adequate treatment with vitamin D and calcium should be guaranteed. Children with additional risk factors for 25(OH)D deficiency and nutritional rickets should be assessed periodically and treated promptly to prevent further bone damage.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol-treatment-in-pediatrics-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=calcifediol-25ohd-deficiency-and-its-treatment-in-womens-health-and-fertility---april-2022>Calcifediol (25OHD) Deficiency and Its Treatment in Women’s Health and Fertility - April 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(9), 1820; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091820>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091820</a></p><p>by Ana Arnanz 1,2,Juan A.

The unequivocal presence of vitamin D receptors in different tissues related to fertility, and to specific aspects of women’s health such as pregnancy, undoubtedly implies functions of this steroid hormone in both male and female fertility and establishes relationships with different outcomes of human gestation. In order to review the role of the VDES in human fertility, we evaluated the relationships established between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) deficiency and in vitro fertilization, as well as aspects related to ovarian reserve and fertility, and commonly diagnosed endocrinopathies such as polycystic ovary disease. Likewise, we briefly reviewed the relationships between calcifediol deficiency and uterine fibroids, as well as the role that treatment may have in improving human fertility. Finally, the best scientific evidence available on the consequences of calcifediol deficiency during pregnancy is reviewed in relation to those aspects that have accumulated the most scientific literature to date, such as the relationship with the weight of the newborn at the time of delivery, the appearance of preeclampsia, and the risk of developing gestational diabetes and its final consequences for the pregnancy. To date, there is no definitive consensus on the necessary dose for treatment of calcifediol deficiency in the therapeutic management of infertility or during pregnancy. Large prospective clinical intervention studies are needed to clarify the benefits associated with this supplementation and the optimal dose to use in each situation. Although most intervention studies to date have been conducted with cholecalciferol, due to its much longer history of use in daily care, the use of calcifediol to alleviate 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency seems safe, even during pregnancy. The unequivocal presence of vitamin D receptors in very different tissues related to human fertility, both male and female, as well as in structures typical of pregnancy, allows us to investigate the crucial role that this steroid hormone has in specific aspects of women’s health, such as pregnancy and the ability to conceive. Well-designed clinical studies are needed to elucidate the necessary dose and the best form of treatment to resolve the very common calcifediol deficiency in women of reproductive age</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol-women.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=calcifediol-25oh-vitamin-d3-deficiency-a-risk-factor-from-early-to-old-age---march-2022-1>Calcifediol (25OH Vitamin D3) Deficiency: A Risk Factor from Early to Old Age - March 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(6), 1168; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14061168>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14061168</a></p><p>by Roger Bouillon 1,*,Leen Antonio 1,2ORCID andOscar Rosero Olarte 3ORCID</p><p>1 Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, Department of Chronic Diseases and Metabolism, Catholic University of Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium</p><p>2 Department of Endocrinology, University Hospitals Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium</p><p>3 Clinical Endocrinology, Asociación Colombiana de Osteoporosis, Bogotá 500005, Colombia</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is the main cause of nutritional rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. There is consensus that nutritional access to vitamin D can be estimated by measuring serum concentrations of 25OHD and vitamin D deficiency can thus be considered as calcifediol deficiency. However, the threshold for vitamin D/calcifediol sufficiency remains a matter of debate. Vitamin D/calcifediol deficiency has been associated with musculoskeletal effects but also multiple adverse extra-skeletal consequences. If these consequences improve or if they can be treated with vitamin D supplementation is still unclear. Observational studies suggest a higher infection risk in people with low calcifediol levels. There is also a consistent association between serum calcifediol and cardiovascular events and deaths, but large-scale, long-term intervention studies did not show any benefit on cardiovascular outcomes from supplementation, at least not in subjects without clear vitamin D deficiency. Cancer risk also did not change with vitamin D treatment, although there are some data that higher serum calcifediol is associated with longer survival in cancer patients. In pregnant women, vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and low birth weight. Although preclinical studies showed that the vitamin D endocrine system plays a role in certain neural cells as well as brain structure and function, there is no evidence to support a beneficial effect of vitamin D in neurodegenerative diseases. Vitamin D supplementation may marginally affect overall mortality risk especially in elderly subjects with low serum calcifediol concentrations.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcifediol-deficiency.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=rapid-nontranscriptional-effects-of-calcifediol-and-calcitriol---march-2022>Rapid Nontranscriptional Effects of Calcifediol and Calcitriol - March 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(6), 1291; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14061291>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14061291</a></p><p>by Simone Donati 1,Gaia Palmini 1ORCID,Cinzia Aurilia 1,Irene Falsetti 1,Francesca Miglietta 1,Teresa Iantomasi 1ORCID andMaria Luisa Brandi 2,*</p><p>1 Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy</p><p>2 Fondazione Italiana Ricerca sulle Malattie dell’Osso (F.I.R.M.O.

The spectrum of known vitamin D-mediated effects has been expanded in recent years. However, the mechanisms of how exactly this hormone elicits its biological function are still not fully understood. The interaction of this metabolite with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and, subsequently, with the vitamin D-responsive element in the region of specific target genes leading to the transcription of genes whose protein products are involved in the traditional function of calcitriol (known as genomic actions). Moreover, in addition to these transcription-dependent mechanisms, it has been recognized that the biologically active form of vitamin D3, as well as its immediate precursor metabolite, calcifediol, initiate rapid, non-genomic actions through the membrane receptors that are bound as described for other steroid hormones. So far, among the best candidates responsible for mediating rapid membrane response to vitamin D metabolites are membrane-associated VDR (VDRm) and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 (Pdia3). The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the rapid, non-genomic effects of calcifediol and calcitriol, whose elucidation could improve the understanding of the vitamin D3 endocrine system. This will contribute to a better recognition of the physiological acute functions of vitamin D3, and it could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets able to modulate these actions.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/rapid-nontranscriptional-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-supplementation-cholecalciferol-calcifediol-and-calcitriol---vieth-2020>Vitamin D supplementation: cholecalciferol, calcifediol, and calcitriol - Vieth 2020</h4><p>Eur J Clin Nutr. 2020 Nov;74(11):1493-1497. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0697-1>doi: 10.1038/s41430-020-0697-1</a> PDF is behind a paywall</p><p>Reinhold Vieth 1</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/vieth-chart.png alt=image width=600><p>The specific compound that is meant for use in the context of vitamin D supplementation is often ambiguous. The term &ldquo;supplementation&rdquo; has been used in the context of cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcidiol, and calcitriol. In nature, by far the major form of vitamin D that nurtures the body is cholecalciferol. In contrast, ergocalciferol is primarily a synthetic and less stable product which is less potent per microgram dose than is cholecalciferol. Calcidol is the major circulating metabolite of cholecalciferol, while calcitriol is the hormone that upregulates the active transport of calcium from the gut, and which suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion. Nutrition policy papers and guidelines leave unstated the obvious fact that calcidiol and calcitriol are not nutrients, and that those metabolites are not pertinent to food fortification or dietary supplementation. Recent evidence shows that ergocalciferol is not stable with storage, and it is far more susceptible to breakdown with cooking and baking than is cholecalciferol. Therefore, it must be concluded that cholecalciferol is the only form of vitamin D that should be considered in the context of the nutritional functions of fortification and supplementation.</p><hr><h4 id=see-also-web>See also web</h4><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/6/1617%20>Cholecalciferol or Calcifediol in the Management of Vitamin D Deficiency</a> May 2020 FREE PDF</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/6/1617>Hypovitaminosis D: Is It Time to Consider the Use of Calcifediol?</a> May 2019 FREE PDF</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2778%20>Effects of Weekly Supplementation of Cholecalciferol and Calcifediol Among the Oldest-Old People: Findings From a Randomized Pragmatic Clinical Trial</a> Nov 2019 FREE PDF</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=wonder-if-calcifediol-is-stored-in-musclefat-and-is-available-for-breastfeeding>Wonder if Calcifediol is stored in muscle/fat, and is available for breastfeeding</h4><p><strong><a href=/posts/getting-vitamin-d-into-your-blood-and-cells>Getting Vitamin D into your blood and cells</a> has the following chart</strong></p><img src=/attachments/d3.mock.jpg alt=image width=600><p><strong>Short url =</strong> is.gd/calcifediol</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/asthma.html><span class=tag>asthma</span></a>
