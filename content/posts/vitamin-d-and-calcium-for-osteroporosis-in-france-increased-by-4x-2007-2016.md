Purpose: To describe the trends in the pharmacological management of postmenopausal osteoporosis in France during the period 2007-2016.

Method: This cross-sectional, yearly repeated study of patients in France used the nationwide claim database 'Échantillon Généraliste de Bénéficiaires', (EGB) covering a 1 in 97 representative sample of approximately 600,000 individuals insured by the main French public insurance scheme. For women aged 50-89 years, prescriptions for all  **anti-osteoporosis medications (AOMs)**  marketed in France during the study period (bisphosphonates alone or used in combination with calcium, selective estrogen receptor modulators, strontium ranelate, teriparatide or denosumab) were identified in each calendar year. Initiation of any AOM in a calendar year was defined by the absence of a prescription for any AOM within the 2 previous calendar years. Incidence was calculated for all AOM prescriptions and initial prescriptions for AOM.

Results: Marked changes were observed in the rates of women receiving any AOM, with a slight increase from 2007 to 2009 (from 10.22 to 10.42 per 100 patient-years <span>[PY]</span>), then a plateau in 2009-2010, followed by a rapid and more than twofold decrease until 2016 (from 10.39 to 5.02 per 100 PY). The decrease in the overall rate of women initiating an AOM showed a rapid halving from 2007 to 2012 (from 2.56 to 1.15 per 100 PY), followed by a plateau in a range 0.90-1.0 per 100 PY during the period 2013-2016. 

In contrast, the use of calcium/vitamin D has been rapidly increasing as the only prevention and exclusive intervention for postmenopausal osteoporosis, from 

* 10.6% of women in 2007 to 

* 47.7% in 2016. 

The profile of patients initiating AOM changed substantially over the 10-year period. Despite a stable mean age of approximately 69 years, an increasing proportion of women with severe chronic comorbidities (from 34.9% to 43.3%), history of fractures (from 7.8% to 13.3%) or high-dose steroid use (from 2.9% to 8.4%) was observed. The decline of AOM initiation was associated with a marked reduction of prescriptions during the study period: 

* by 64.2% for primary care physicians; 

* by 36.7% for specialty doctors; and 

* by 18.4% for rheumatologists.

Conclusion: These findings suggest a general trend toward an AOM uptake increasingly limited to a fraction of patients who are at high risk of fractures. In the context of an aging population and declining prescription rates for AOM, these data highlight an increasing treatment gap among women in France with osteoporosis, which is similar to that seen in other European countries and in the US.
