#### Effects of an 8-week high-dose vitamin D supplementation on fatigue and neuropsychiatric manifestations in post-COVID syndrome: A randomized controlled trial

Aim: This study evaluated the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in alleviating fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms in post-COVID syndrome.

Methods: In an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 80 patients with post-COVID fatigue or neuropsychiatric symptoms were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 60,000 IU of vitamin D weekly (n = 40) or a placebo (n = 40) for 8 weeks. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the 11-item  **Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ-11)** ; 21-item  **Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21);**  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI);  **Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE)** ; and Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A and TMT-B). Baseline and 8-week measurements of inflammatory markers, including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were also collected.

Results: Significant improvements were found in the vitamin D group for

* CFQ (coefficient -3.5, P = 0.024), 

* DASS-anxiety (-2.0, P = 0.011), and 

* ACE (2.1, P = 0.012). 

No significant differences were observed in PSQI, DASS-depression, TMT, IL-6, or CRP levels. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between groups, with no serious adverse events reported.

Conclusion: High-dose vitamin D supplementation may benefit patients with post-COVID syndrome by reducing fatigue, alleviating anxiety, and improving cognitive symptoms, with minimal side effects.
