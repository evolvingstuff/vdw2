**DMSO is able to enhance “small sized” molecules (< 500 daltons) getting through the skin** 

Have not yet found out the DMSO "speedup factor"

DMSO was made in 1860 and its transdermal properties were discovered about 40 years later

High concentration DMSO has used on the skin for various purposed 4 times a day for a month

DMSO by itself has various health benefits

[The 500 Dalton Rule of Dermal Penetration and Cosmetic Science](https://realizebeauty.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/cosmetic-science/%20) March 2017

This 500 dalton size limit was also mentioned in one of the DMSO references below

 **Here are a few Dalton Sizes** 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| L Ascorbic Acid: | 176 Daltons |
| Resveratrol  | 228 Daltons |
| Testosterone  | 288 Daltons |
| Vitamin D  | 400 Daltons |
| Magnesium ion<br>Chloride | [24 Daltons](https://www.thetideswellness.com/research-transdermal-magnesium/) |
| Water  | 18 Daltons |

#### Notes by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki

I have successfully using low concentration DMSO in an aloe vera gel on my skin to get  **Magnesium and Boron**  into my body

* [Dupuytren’s Contracture (bent finger) treated by Boron and DMSO - 2016](/posts/dupuytrens-contracture-bent-finger-treated-by-boron-and-dmso-2016)

   * The Dupuytren's becomes bothersome several times a year and goes away each time after 2 treatments

* Magnesium Chloride water/oil added to DMSO cream treats sore muscles in about 10 minutes

* [239 products on Amazon for Transdermal Magnesium as of April 2019](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?field-keywords=transdermal+magnesium)

   * The only one I tried caused my skin to rash after about a month, so I gave it up and made my own

* [I needed more than Vitamin D to treat my knee osteoarthritis](/posts/i-needed-more-than-vitamin-d-to-treat-my-knee-osteoarthritis)   **Magnesium and Low Level Laser Therapy** 

In April 2019 I got a painful shoulder which I assumed was Calcium deposits, similar to my wife's which were diagnosed by MRI

I found a reference on the web to the use of an acid  **(Ascorbic Acid) to disolve Calcium** 

After just a few days my shoulder pain appears to have gone away

 **Note: Suspect that my Vitamin K (Super K LEF) did not keep Calcium from accumulating in my soft tissues** 

* [Hard bones, soft arteries, rather than vice versa (Vitamin D and Vitamin K) – March 2016](/posts/hard-bones-soft-arteries-rather-than-vice-versa-vitamin-d-and-vitamin-k)

* Another person switched from Super K to another supplier and was able to remove Calcium which had bulit up in his artiries while taking Super K.  I need to investigate (May 2019)

 **Expect to experiment with transdermal Vitamin D and Resveratrol in the future**

"Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur compound stored in every cell of the body. It helps the hair, skin, and nails grow faster, softer and stronger apart from improving neurological functions and reducing pain"

MSM was developed after DMSO

### [Overview at DMSO.ORG](https://www.dmso.org/articles/information/muir.htm)

* "Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a by-product of the wood industry, has been in use as a commercial solvent since 1953. It is also one of the most studied but least understood pharmaceutical agents of our time- -at least in the United States. According to Stanley Jacob, MD, a former head of the organ transplant program at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, more than 40,000 articles on its chemistry have appeared in scientific journals, which, in conjunction with thousands of laboratory studies, provide strong evidence of a wide variety of properties. (See Major Properties Attributed to DMSO) Worldwide, some 11,000 articles have been written on its medical and clinical implications, and in 125 countries throughout the world, including Canada, Great Britain, Germany, and Japan, doctors prescribe it for a variety of ailments, including pain, inflammation, scleroderma, interstitial cystitis, and arthritis elevated intercranial pressure."

* "In the first flush of enthusiasm over the drug, six pharmaceutical companies embarked on clinical studies. Then, in November 1965, a woman in Ireland died of an allergic reaction after taking DMSO and several other drugs. Although the precise cause of the woman's death was never determined, the press reported it to be DMSO. Two months later, the FDA closed down clinical trials in the United States, citing the woman's death and changes in the lenses of certain laboratory animals that had been given doses of the drug many times higher than would be given humans."

* "Some 20 years and hundreds of laboratory and human studies later, no other deaths have been reported, nor have changes in the eyes of humans been documented or claimed. Since then, however, the FDA has refused seven applications to conduct clinical studies, and approved only 1, for intersititial cystitis, which subsequently was approved for prescriptive use in 1978."

 **Reminds me of the Vitamin D scare in the 1950's, which also proved to be totally wrong - Founder of VitaminDWiki**
