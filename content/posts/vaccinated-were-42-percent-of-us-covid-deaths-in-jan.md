#### Covid deaths no longer overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated as toll on elderly grows

 **[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/04/29/covid-deaths-unvaccinated-boosters/?)** 

* “The vaccinated made up  **42 percent**  of fatalities in January and February during the highly contagious omicron variant’s surge, compared with  **23 percent**  of the dead in September…”

* “The bulk of vaccinated deaths are among people who did not get a booster shot, according to state data provided to The Post. In two of the states, California and Mississippi, three-quarters of the vaccinated senior citizens who died in January and February did not have booster doses. 

Reasons appear to include

1. Vaccines waning

1. Vaccines not as effective against Omicron

1. Omicron is focused more on the elderly 

> who appear to be less likely to have been recently  vaccinated (boosted)

##### % Deaths vs age

##### % Deaths vs Boosted, Vaxxed, and Unvaxxed

 **Note Omicron deaths are  increasing even among the boosted**
