Context: Maternal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> status in pregnancy has been associated with offspring bone development and adiposity. Vitamin D has also been implicated in postnatal muscle function but little is known about a role for antenatal 25(OH)D exposure in programming muscle development.

Objective: We investigated the associations between maternal plasma 25(OH)D status at 34 weeks gestation and offspring lean mass and muscle strength at 4 years of age.

Design and setting: A prospective UK population-based mother-offspring cohort: the Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS).

Participants: 12583 non-pregnant women were initially recruited into SWS, of which 3159 had singleton pregnancies. 678 mother-child pairs were included in this analysis.

Main Outcomes Measured: At 4 years of age, offspring assessments included hand grip strength (Jamar Dynamometer) and whole body DXA (Hologic Discovery) yielding lean mass and % lean mass. Physical activity was assessed by 7-day accelerometry (Actiheart) in a subset of children (n=326).

Results: Maternal serum 25(OH)D concentration in pregnancy was  **positively associated with offspring height-adjusted hand grip strength (β=0.10 SD/SD, p=0.013)** , which persisted after adjustment for maternal confounding factors, duration of breastfeeding and child’s physical activity at 4 years (β=0.13 SD/SD, p=0.014). Maternal 25(OH)D was also positively associated with offspring %lean mass (β=0.11 SD/SD, p=0.006), but not total lean mass (β=0.06, p=0.15). This however did not persist after adjustment for confounding factors (β=0.09 SD/SD, p=0.11).

Conclusions: This observational study suggests that intrauterine exposure to 25(OH)D during late pregnancy might influence offspring muscle development through an effect primarily on muscle strength rather than muscle mass.
