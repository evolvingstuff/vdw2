#### [Testing for Zika Isn’t the Only Way to Keep the Blood Supply Safe](http://www.wired.com/2016/08/testing-zika-isnt-way-keep-blood-supply-safe/) Wired

* Previously only recommended Zika areas for testing, now extended to the entire US

* Testing is very costly: $150 per unit of blood

* 80 percent of Zika infections are asymptomatic

* . . “in Puerto Rico, CDC scientists have found that nearly 1 percent of blood collected from asymptomatic donors tested positive for Zika.”

* Killing all pathogens in plasma is much lower cost, and has been used in Europe for over a decade

> Cannot kill the pathogens in red blood cells however
