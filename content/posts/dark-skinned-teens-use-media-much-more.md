### Clipped from Good website: [Kids of Color Consume a Lot More Media Than White Kids](http://www.good.is/post/kids-of-color-consume-a-lot-more-media-than-white-kids/) June 2011

"A [new study](http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2011/06/media-usa-youth-wartella.html) at Northwestern University found a huge difference between the amount of media white and nonwhite kids consume. 

Minority children ages 8 to 18 consume an average of 13 hours of media content a dayâ€”about 4-and-a-half hours more than their white counterparts. 

 **In the last ten years, this number has doubled for black children and quadrupled for Hispanics** ."
