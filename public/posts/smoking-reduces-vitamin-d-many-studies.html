Approximately 7 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use, while approximately 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. About 200 million of the world&rsquo;s one billion smokers are women and usage among women is increasing in some countries. Nicotine from smoking tobacco, specifically its metabolite cotinine, has negative effects on human health causing lung cancer, COPD and non-respiratory problems. Over a billion people worldwide are Vitamin D deficient or insufficient, which is prevalent across all age-groups, geographic regions, and sunlight. With the discovery of Vitamin D in 1919, a new chapter in the prevention of rickets was introduced opening the door to its therapeutic properties for other diseases. Since 1919, there have been many clinical and epidemiolocal studies performed globally on the effect of the vitamin on prevention of other diseases, including but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoporosis. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with reduced levels of Vitamin D in the bloodstream and sinus tissues. Manavi et al. (2015) demonstrated that among three smoking categories (heavy, light, and non-smokers),</p><ul><li><p>black female heavy smokers have lower vitamin D (13.374 ng/ml), than</p></li><li><p>Hispanic (19.213 ng/ml) or</p></li><li><p>white (24.929 ng/ml)</p></li></ul><p>females are correlating to higher levels of cotinine. Therefore, blood serum concentrations of cotinine contribute to decreased Vitamin D concentrations in addition to other factors such as gender and ethnicity.</p><hr><h4 id=40-less-likely-to-have-tobacco-related-cancer-if--30-ng-of-vitamin-d---oct-2015>40% less likely to have tobacco-related cancer if > 30 ng of vitamin D - Oct 2015</h4><p><strong>Prospective associations between vitamin D status, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.</strong></p><p>Am J Clin Nutr. 2015 Oct 7. pii: ajcn110510</p><p>Deschasaux M1, Souberbielle JC2, Latino-Martel P3, Sutton A4, Charnaux N4, Druesne-Pecollo N3, Galan P3, Hercberg S5, Le Clerc S6, Kesse-Guyot E3, Ezzedine K7, Touvier M3.</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>Experimental evidence has suggested that vitamin D may be protective against tobacco-related cancers through the inhibition of the formation of tumors induced by tobacco carcinogens. To our knowledge, only one previous epidemiologic study investigated the association between vitamin D status and tobacco-related cancer risk, and no study has focused on vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>Our objective was to prospectively study the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.</p><p>DESIGN:</p><p>A total of 209 tobacco-related cancers were diagnosed within the SU.VI.MAX (Supplémentation en vitamines et minéraux antioxidants) cohort (1994-2007) and were matched with 418 controls as part of a nested case-control study. Tobacco-related cancers (i.e., cancers for which tobacco is one of the risk factors) included several sites in the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, and urinary systems. Total plasma 25(OH)D was assessed with the use of an electrochemoluminescent assay. Polymorphisms were determined with the use of a TaqMan assay. Conditional logistic regression models were computed.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>A 25(OH)D concentration ≥30 ng/mL was associated with <strong>reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers (OR for ≥30 vs. &lt;30 ng/mL: 0.59;</strong> 95% CI 0.35, 0.99; P = 0.046).

Low vitamin D levels during pregnancy may lead to preeclampsia and gestational diabetes in the mother, while it may cause low birth weight and respiratory problems in the infant.</p><p>Method: The study group consisted of 42 mothers, who smoked regularly, and their infants and 45 mothers (passive smokers), who were regularly exposed to second-hand smoke in their home environment, although they did not smoke, and their infants. Meanwhile, the control group consisted of 46 healthy mothers, who did not smoke and were not exposed to second-hand smoke at home, and their infants with similar gestational age and birth weight. Blood samples were taken as two different samples, from the mother and the baby, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and related blood parameters were studied and compared statistically.</p><p>Results: 25(OH)D, calcium, and magnesium levels of mothers who smoked were significantly lower than those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who did not. Moreover, the vitamin D levels of mothers and babies exposed to second-hand smoke in the non-smoker group were significantly lower than mothers and babies who were not exposed to second-hand smoke. In the babies of these three groups, a significant decrease was observed only in vitamin D levels.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study shows that pregnant women and their infants exposed to second-hand smoke have lower vitamin D levels. Hence, more emphasis should be put on vitamin D monitoring and supplementation to prevent severe health problems in pregnant women and their infants exposed to tobacco smoke. Further studies are needed to assess the associated risks for maternal and fetal health as well as possible long-term implications for the infant.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/2nd-hand-smoke.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=faster-decline-in-lung-function-when-smokers-had-low-vitamin-d--april-2021>Faster decline in lung function when smokers had low vitamin D – April 2021</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D deficiency and lung function decline in healthy individuals: A large longitudinal observation study</strong></p><p>Respir Med. 2021 Apr 20;182:106395. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106395>doi: 10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106395</a></p><p>Kyung-Min Ahn 1, Sun-Sin Kim 2, Suh-Young Lee 1, So-Hee Lee 2, Heung-Woo Park 3</p><p>Aim: A reliable evidence from a comprehensive large-scale study supporting associations between serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) level (SVDL) and lung function decline (LFD) in healthy individuals has been unavailable. Using a well-established health screening database, we assessed the associations between SVDL and LFDs, measured as the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC ratio.</p><p>Methods: Serial SVDL and lung function data were analyzed using linear mixed models, which were performed in smokers and non-smokers separately. Vitamin D-deficient individuals (VDDs) were defined when their SVDLs were consistently lower than 20 ng/mL at all measurements.</p><p>Results: A total of 1371 individuals were analyzed. The mean FEV1 decline rates of VDDs and vitamin D-normal individuals (VDNs) in smokers were -33.35 mL/year (95% CI: 39.44 to -27.26 mL/year) and -15.61 mL/year (95% CI: 27.29 to -4.21 mL/year) respectively, over a mean of 6.29 years of observation with statistical significance (P &lt; 0.001). However, there was no significant differences observed between decline rates of FEV1 in non-smokers. Similarly, FVC decline rates of VDDs were significantly greater than those of VDNs only in smokers (P &lt; 0.001). However, FEV1/FVC ratio decline rates showed no significant difference between VDDs and VDNs regardless of their smoking status.</p><p>Conclusions: Consistently low SVDLs predicted more rapid FEV1 and FVC declines in smokers. However, FEV1/FVC decline rate was not associated with SVDL. SVDL may be used to identify healthy smoking individuals at high risk for accelerated LFD.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
