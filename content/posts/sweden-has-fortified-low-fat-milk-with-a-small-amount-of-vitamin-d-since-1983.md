* Info in Swedish can be found [here](http://www.slv.se/sv/grupp1/livsmedelsforetag/Aromer-tillsatser-enzymer-och-berikning/Berikning/)

* applies to low-fat milk only - milk containing fat below 1,5% has to be enriched with Vitamin D. Vitamin D content must be between 3,8-5 micrograms/litre.

4 micrograms/litre= 160 IU/liter

Many organizations now recommend 4,0000 IU of vitamin D3 per day for adults

which would requre 25 liters of low-fat milk

And, we hope that Sweden fortififies with D3, not D2
