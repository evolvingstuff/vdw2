#### Role of vitamin D in COVID-19 and other viral infections

World J Virol. Sep 25, 2024; 13(3):  [doi: 10.5501/wjv.v13.i3.95349](https://doi.org/10.5501/wjv.v13.i3.95349)

Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that is naturally produced in the body or obtained through dietary sources, primarily under the influence of UVB radiation. This essential nutrient has a vital role in numerous physiological processes, encompassing immune function, cell growth, differentiation, insulin regulation, and cardiovascular well-being, along with its pivotal role in sustaining the delicate equilibrium of calcium and phosphate concentrations in the body. 

Moreover, vitamin D reinforces mucosal defense and bolsters the immune system through immunomodulation, making it a critical component of overall health. 

Numerous studies have unveiled the profound connection between vitamin D and the predisposition to respiratory tract infections, including well-known viruses such as influenza and the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. 

Vitamin D deficiency has been consistently linked to increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a heightened risk of mortality among afflicted individuals. 

Retrospective observational studies have further substantiated these findings, indicating that levels of vitamin D are linked with both the occurrence and severity of COVID-19 cases. 

Vitamin D has its influence on viral infections through a multitude of mechanisms, such as promoting the release of antimicrobial peptides and fine-tuning the responses of the immune system. 

Additionally, vitamin D is intertwined with the intricate network of the renin–angiotensin system, suggesting a potential impact on the development of complications related to COVID-19. 

While further clinical trials and extensive research are warranted, the existing body of evidence strongly hints at the possible use of vitamin D as a valuable tool in the prophylaxis and management of COVID-19 and other viral infectious diseases.
