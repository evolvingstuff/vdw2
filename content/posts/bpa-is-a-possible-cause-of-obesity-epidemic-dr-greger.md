 **Highlights by VitaminDWiki** 

* Weight increase in most people and domestic animals on the planet

* BPA known to product fat cells in petrie dish

* Stop canned and packaged foods for a few days ==> drop in BPA

* Fast for a few days ==> 10X decrease of BPA in urine

* Add soup (with BPA) to diet ==> 10X increase in BPA in urine

* Higher levels of BPA and plastics found to be associated with increased weight gain

 **Would be intresting to find out** 

* Are people who get little BPA less likely to become obese?

* Are pets which get little BPA less likely to become obese?

 **A possible path** 

BPA==> Disrupts endocrine system

Which ==> reduces Vitamin D levels in tissue (not necessarily in blood)

Which ==> Increases weight gain

   * "By virtue of extensive research attention, bisphenol A (BPA) has become the so-called poster child for endocrine-disrupting chemicals. This high production (approximately 9 million tons per year) molecule is used in a wide range of consumer products (eg, plastics, epoxy resins, and thermal receipts), resulting in daily human exposure"

The purported link between obesity and hormone-disrupting plastics chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) was initially based in part on observations that the [rise](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147575) in chemical exposure seemed to [coincide](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12006126) with the rise of the obesity epidemic, but that may only be a coincidence. Many other changes over the last half century, like an [increase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9491022) in fast-food consumption and watching TV, would seem to be simpler explanations. But why are our pets [getting](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23296821) fatter, too? Fido isn’t eating more fries or drinking more soda. Of course, the more we watch Seinfeld reruns, the less we may walk the dog, but what about our cats? They’re also getting fatter. Are we giving both them and our kids a few too many treats? That would seem to be an easier explanation than some pervasive obesity-causing chemical in the environment building up in the pet and person food chains.

How then do we explain the results of a study of more than 20,000 animals from 24 populations, [showing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106594) they are all getting fatter? The odds that this could happen just by chance is about 1 in 10 million. The study’s “findings reveal that large and sustained population increases in body weight” are occurring across the board, even in those without access to vending machines or getting less physical education in schools. Perhaps some environmental pollutant is involved. I discuss this in my video [ **How to Avoid the Obesity-Related Plastic Chemical BPA** ](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-avoid-the-obesity-related-plastic-chemical-bpa/).

We’re [exposed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147575) to a whole cocktail of new chemicals besides BPA, but the reason researchers have zeroed in on it is because of experiments [showing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15659569) that BPA can accelerate the production of new fat cells, at least in a petri dish. This was at more than a thousand times the concentration found in most people’s bloodstream, though. We didn’t know if the same thing happened at typical levels…until now. Most people [have](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25143472) between 1 and 20 nanomoles of BPA in their blood, but even 1 nanomole may significantly boost human fat cell production. So, even low levels may be a problem, but that’s in a petri dish. What about in people?

Why not just measure the body weights of a population exposed to the chemical compared to a population not exposed to the chemical? There [is](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889897) virtually no unexposed population: BPA is everywhere. In that case, how about those with higher levels compared to those with lower levels? This is what researchers at New York University did, and the amount of BPA [flowing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22990270) through the bodies of children and adolescents “was significantly associated with obesity.” However, since it was a cross-sectional study, a snapshot in time, we don’t know which came first. Maybe instead of the high BPA levels leading to obesity, the obesity led to high BPA levels, since the chemical is stored in fat. Or, perhaps BPA is a marker for the same kinds of processed foods that can make you fat. What we need are prospective studies that [measure](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311796) exposure and then follow people over time. We never had anything like that…until now! And indeed, researchers [found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722546) that higher levels of BPA and some other plastics chemicals were significantly associated with faster weight gain over the subsequent decade. So, how can we stay away from the stuff?

Though we [inhale](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22889897) some from dust and get some through our skin touching BPA-laden receipts,  **90 percent of exposure is from our diet** . How can we tell? When we have people [fast](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23026348) and drink water only out of glass bottles for a few days, their  **BPA levels drop as much as tenfold.** 

Fasting isn’t very sustainable, though.

What happens with a three-day fresh foods intervention, where families [switch](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21450549) away from canned and packaged foods for a few days? A significant drop in BPA exposure. If we do the experiment the other way, [adding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22110104) a serving of canned soup to people’s daily diet, we see a thousand percent rise in BPA levels in their urine compared to a serving of soup prepared with fresh ingredients. That study used a ready-to-serve canned soup, which, in the largest survey of North American canned foods, was found to [have](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20537264) about 85 percent less BPA than condensed soups, but the worst was canned tuna.
