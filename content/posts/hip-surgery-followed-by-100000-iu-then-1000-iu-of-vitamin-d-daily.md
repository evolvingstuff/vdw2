## Hypovitaminosis D is common in older people. Low vitamin D may contribute to hip fracture risk.

Methods During a 15-week period all people admitted for revalidation after hip surgery (elective or after fracture) were screened for hypovitaminosis D. 

A standard substitution was given consisting of  **100,000 IU vitamin D at day 1 followed by calcium/vit D 1000/880 once daily**  together with a high caloric nutritional supplement. 

Vitamin D, PTH and nutritional parameters were measured at baseline and at follow-up.

Results One hundred and three patients were enrolled (78% women, mean age 82.1 ± 6.2 years) of which 82% were treated for hip fracture. 

In the fracture group there is a significantly higher prevalence of osteoporosis (63.9% versus 20.0%; p ? 0.005). 

Vitamin D insufficiency (< 30 ng/ml) is extremely prevalent in both groups (94.2% versus 92.8%) with levels below 15 ng/ml in respectively 35.3% and 53.0% for the elective and the fracture group. Highest values of PTH were seen in people with the lowest levels of vitamin D. 

After intervention there is a significant rise in serum vitamin D (15.6–26.3 ng/ml; p ? 0.001) and a significant reduction in plasma PTH (40.2–32.1 pg/ml; p ? 0.001).

Conclusion  A majority of patients after hip surgery has vitamin D deficiency. People with traumatic fracture were significantly more osteoporotic. 

By implementing standard vitamin D and caloric supplementation in the revalidation after hip surgery PTH levels are significantly lowered and nutritional parameters improve.
