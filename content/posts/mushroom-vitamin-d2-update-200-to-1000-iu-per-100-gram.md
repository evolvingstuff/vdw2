### Vitamin D and Sterol Composition of Ten Types of Mushrooms from Retail Suppliers in the United States.

J Agric Food Chem. 2011 Jun 13.

Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and sterols were analyzed in mushrooms sampled nationwide in the U.S. to update the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Vitamin D2 was assayed using HPLC with <span>[3H]</span>-vitamin D3 internal standard and sterols by GC-FID mass spectrometric (MS) confirmation. 

Vitamin D2 was 

* low (0.1-0.3 µg/100g) in Agaricus bisporus (white button, crimini, portabella) and enoki, 

* moderate in shiitake and oyster (0.4-0.7 µg/100g), and 

* high in morel, chanterelle, maitake (5.2-28.1 µg/100g) and 

* UV-treated portabella (3.4-20.9 µg/100g), 

with significant variability among composites for some types. 

Ergosterol (mg/100g) was highest in maitake and shiitake (79.2, 84.9) and lowest in morel and enoki (26.3, 35.5); the range was <10 mg/100g among white button composites but 12-50 among samples of other types. All mushrooms contained ergosta-5,7-dienol (22,23-dihydroergosterol) (3.53-18.0 mg/100g) and (except morel) ergosta-7-enol. Only morel contained brassicasterol (28.6 mg/100g) and campesterol (1.23-4.54 mg/100g) and no ergosta-7,22-dienol. MS was critical in distinguishing campesterol from ergosta-7,22-dienol.
