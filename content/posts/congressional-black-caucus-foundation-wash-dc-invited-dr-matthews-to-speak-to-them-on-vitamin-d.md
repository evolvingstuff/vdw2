#### Matthews Invited to Speak at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBC) on Vitamin D in Washington, D.C., in September

Matthews, a world renown vitamin D expert, has also recently been invited to speak at the [United Nations General Assembly](/posts/un-invited-dr-matthews-to-speak-about-vitamin-d-in-both-sept-and) in New York City, Nigeria, and other countries on the African continent. Princess Moradeun Ogunlana (Yoruba Royalty of Nigeria) and Bio-Tech Pharmacal are spearheading a bold plan to address vitamin D deficiency in 54 countries and in 1.3 billion people on the African Continent.

 **Matthews has also spoken at the**  

* U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 

* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world and adds billions of dollars to healthcare costs. Countries lowering their healthcare costs by addressing the most common nutritional deficiency in the world can then use those billions of dollars for infrastructure, education, and improving the overall quality of life for their citizens.
