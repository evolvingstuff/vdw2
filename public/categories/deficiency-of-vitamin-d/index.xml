&lt;p>OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. There has been an increase in testing for vitamin D with a concomitant increase in costs. While individual factors are significantly linked to vitamin D status, prior studies have not yielded a model predictive of vitamin D status or 25(OH)D levels. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a prediction model of vitamin D could be developed using extensive demographic data and laboratory parameters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnesium Deficiency Reduces Vitamin D Effectiveness</title><link>/posts/magnesium-deficiency-reduces-vitamin-d-effectiveness.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/magnesium-deficiency-reduces-vitamin-d-effectiveness.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Most people not getting enough Vitamin D, Magnesium, and Vitamin E</title><link>/posts/most-people-not-getting-enough-vitamin-d-magnesium-and-vitamin-e.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/most-people-not-getting-enough-vitamin-d-magnesium-and-vitamin-e.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="foods-fortificants-and-supplements-where-do-americans-get-their-nutrients">Foods, Fortificants, and Supplements: Where Do Americans Get Their Nutrients?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D is cutaneously synthesized following sun exposure (vitamin D3) as well as it is derived from dietary intake (vitamin D3 and D2). Vitamin D2 and D3 are metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). This metabolite is considered the functional indicator of vitamin D stores in humans. Since Jordan latitude is 31oN, cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 should be sufficient all year round. However, many indications reveal that it is not the case. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the 25(OH)D status among Jordanians.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency and testing in Australia are epidemics</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-testing-in-australia-are-epidemics.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-testing-in-australia-are-epidemics.html</guid><description>&lt;p>~Highlights from &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/experts-at-odds-on-vitamin-d-tests-for-pregnant-women-20110802-1i9lp.html">Sidney Morning Herald Aug 2011&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D deficiency is high in winter because of reduced exposure to sunlight. It seems that in places with high humidity and a sultry climate, exposure to sunlight in summer can be low too. This study was designed to determine the vitamin D deficiency prevalence in Sari, a city with a high humidity climate at the end of summer, and compare it to winter. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on men and women aged 10 to 70. Clustered blood samples were received from 351 subjects who participated in this study toward the end of summer, and in winter. The levels of serum vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and PTH were measured. T test and X2 were used for data analysis. Results: 351subjects (66.4% women, 33.6% men) aged 11 to 69 (mean age ± SD 37.11 ± 12.6) participated in the study.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Council vs FDA concerning vitamin D deficiency in blacks and others</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-council-vs-fda-concerning-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-blacks-and-others.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-council-vs-fda-concerning-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-blacks-and-others.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="following-email-was-sent-end-of-june-2011---no-action-was-taken">Following email was sent end of June 2011 - no action was taken&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Dear Vitamin D Council Member,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need your help! This summer, the Vitamin D Council is set to file a 17-page complaint against Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding their vitamin D food fortification policies and how they disparately afflict African Americans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through a combination of mandated and encouraged practices, the FDA depends upon milk to deliver virtually all supplemental dietary vitamin D to Americans. The FDA knows African Americans consume little milk, particularly relative to Caucasian Americans. The FDA, in effect, chooses to fortify a food that does not target a population who most need vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diabetes rising quickly in areas with recent air conditioning</title><link>/posts/diabetes-rising-quickly-in-areas-with-recent-air-conditioning.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/diabetes-rising-quickly-in-areas-with-recent-air-conditioning.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="reported-by-medicalxpresshttpmedicalxpresscomnews2011-06-million-adults-diabetes-reveals-scalehtml">&lt;a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-06-million-adults-diabetes-reveals-scale.html">reported by MedicalXpress&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Adams DD. From the Faculty of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following their Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the defective gene causing familial hypercholesterolaemia, Brown and Goldstein misunderstood the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of the associated arterial disease. They ascribed this to an effect of the high levels of cholesterol circulating in the blood. In reality, the accelerated arterial damage is likely to be a consequence of more brittle arterial cell walls, as biochemists know cholesterol to be a component of them which modulates their fluidity, conferring flexibility and hence resistance to damage from the ordinary hydrodynamic blood forces. In the absence of efficient receptors for LDL cholesterol, cells will be unable to use this component adequately for the manufacture of normally resilient arterial cell walls, resulting in accelerated arteriosclerosis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D less than 10 ng for groups of 45 year olds</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-less-than-10-ng-for-groups-of-45-year-olds.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-less-than-10-ng-for-groups-of-45-year-olds.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objective was to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women. Blood samples were taken from 154 African-American, 194 Hispanic, and 146 Caucasian women at &amp;lt;14 weeks of gestation; 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mean 25(OH)D levels in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women were 15.5 ± 7.2 (standard deviation), 24.1 ± 8.7, 29.0 ± 8.5 ng/mL, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of African-Americans, 81% of Hispanics, and 67% of Caucasians were deficient (25(OH)D levels &amp;lt;20 ng/mL or &amp;lt;50 nmol/L) or insufficient (25(OH)D levels ? 20 ng/mL or &amp;lt;32 ng/mL or ? 50 nmol/L or &amp;lt;80 nmol/L). Of these pregnant women, 82% had vitamin D levels &amp;lt;32 ng/mL (&amp;lt;80 ng/mL). In logistic regression models, race was the most important risk factor for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. African-American women and Hispanic women were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency than Caucasian women. Furthermore, primigravid women were more at risk for vitamin D insufficiency. This study demonstrates widespread vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in pregnant females living at a southern latitude. African-Americans are at greatest risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heart Failure associated with vitamin D deficiency</title><link>/posts/heart-failure-associated-with-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/heart-failure-associated-with-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="is-vitamin-d-deficiency-associated-with-heart-failure-a-review-of-current-evidence">Is Vitamin D Deficiency Associated With Heart Failure?

&lt;p>Mounting evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency could be linked to several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its correlates to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency was common in the US population, especially in certain minority groups. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2006 data were analyzed for vitamin D levels in adult participants (N = 4495). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ?20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). The overall prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency was 41.6%, with the highest rate seen in blacks (82.1%), followed by Hispanics (69.2%). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more common among those who had no college education, were obese, with a poor health status, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or not consuming milk daily (all P &amp;lt; .001).

&lt;p>With the prevalence of sunlight exposure in Orange County, California, one would expect it to be rare and unusual to find high incidence of Vitamin D deficiencies among its residents. This study evaluated the concentration of Vitamin D3 as part of a larger study to evaluate bone health in Orange County residents. Our preliminary data shows that 19.2% of the 151 subjects evaluated had low Vitamin D3 (&amp;lt;30 pg/ml) and illuminates a growing problem in the United States. We speculate that the widespread sensitivity to skin cancer and sun exposure, the increased use of sun-screens and the filtering of UV waves in automobile glass has put the public at risk for low Vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>87 percent of Tennessee general medicine patients had less than 32 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/87-percent-of-tennessee-general-medicine-patients-had-less-than-32-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/87-percent-of-tennessee-general-medicine-patients-had-less-than-32-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="prevalence-of-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-deficiency-in-an-urban-general-internal-medicine-academic-practice">Prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in an urban general internal medicine academic practice.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency has received increased academic interest because of its association with many common disease processes. The goal of our study was to document the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. A retrospective chart review of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (ng/mL) levels at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center was conducted on general internal medicine patients over an 18-month period. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficient patients were divided into four groups: severe (&amp;lt;7 ng/mL), moderate (7.0-20.9 ng/mL), mild (21-31.9 ng/mL), and sufficient (&amp;gt;32 ng/mL).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Groups associated with less than 20ng vitamin D – NHANES</title><link>/posts/groups-associated-with-less-than-20ng-vitamin-d-nhanes.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/groups-associated-with-less-than-20ng-vitamin-d-nhanes.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="prevalence-and-correlates-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-us-adults">Prevalence and correlates of vitamin D deficiency in US adults&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is necessary to maintain healthy bones, and may prevent other chronic diseases. There is limited information regarding the vitamin D status of people living in climates with relatively high ambient ultraviolet radiation. We therefore aimed to determine serum 25(OH)D levels in a group of office-workers in subtropical Australia. We collected blood from 129 office workers in summer (n=129) and 175 in winter (91 in both seasons). Serum 25(OH)D was estimated using a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and we asked participants to complete questionnaires about sun exposure and diet for the month prior to blood collection.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>70 percent of Koreans in their twenties had less than 20ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/70-percent-of-koreans-in-their-twenties-had-less-than-20ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/70-percent-of-koreans-in-their-twenties-had-less-than-20ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-korea--a-greater-threat-to-younger-generation">Vitamin D Insufficiency in Korea&amp;ndash;A Greater Threat to Younger Generation:&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is essential for good bone health and for most people sunlight is the most important source of vitamin D. The time required to make sufficient vitamin D varies according to a number of environmental, physical and personal factors, but is typically short and less than the amount of time needed for skin to redden and burn. Enjoying the sun safely, while taking care not to burn, can help to provide the benefits of vitamin D without unduly raising the risk of skin cancer. Vitamin D supplements and specific foods can help to maintain sufficient levels of vitamin D, particularly in people at risk of deficiency. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty around what levels qualify as “optimal” or “sufficient”, how much sunlight different people need to achieve a given level of vitamin D, whether vitamin D protects against chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, and the benefits and risks of widespread supplementation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DSM - holder of many vitamin D patents - to make deficiency map</title><link>/posts/dsm-holder-of-many-vitamin-d-patents-to-make-deficiency-map.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dsm-holder-of-many-vitamin-d-patents-to-make-deficiency-map.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="announcement-dec-15-2010">Announcement Dec 15, 2010&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>PARSIPPANY, N.J.—DSM Nutritional Products partnered with the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) to develop an interactive worldwide map on vitamin D levels to highlight the global problem of vitamin D deficiency. Both organizations agree more advocacy is needed to align the recommended vitamin D intake levels of food and health authorities the world over with more progressive, evidence-based proposals of 1,000 to 2,000 IU per day, especially for risk groups such as women and the elderly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for many diseases</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-a-risk-factor-for-many-diseases.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-a-risk-factor-for-many-diseases.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-universal-risk-factor-for-multifactorial-diseases">Vitamin d deficiency: universal risk factor for multifactorial diseases?&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In the Western world, the majority of morbidity and mortality are caused by multifactorial diseases. Some risk factors are related to more than one type of disease. These so-called universal risk factors are highly relevant to the population, as reduction of universal risk factors may reduce the prevalence of several types of multifactorial disease simultaneously. Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally seen as an etiological factor in bone disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
