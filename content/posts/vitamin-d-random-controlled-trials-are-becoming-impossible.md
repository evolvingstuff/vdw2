#### The way it used to be:

Randomized Controlled Trials used to be the "gold standard" of medicine.

Randomized Controlled Trials with Vitamin D used to be easy.

Randomiy choose people to be in one of 2 (or more) groups

Give vitamin D to one group and a placebo to the other. (typically daily, weekly or monthly)

&nbsp; &nbsp; People rarely became aware of which group they were in.

Run the trial for 2-24 months and note the differences

#### Along comes the web and smartphones:  
&nbsp; &nbsp;(Reason #1: Many people now find out about vitamin D benefits)

Now many people quickly become aware of which group they are in 

There are a huge number of indications when a person is getting enough vitamin D (> 40 nanograms) to make a difference

 **A person getting enough vitamin D will quickly notice a decrease/elimination in** 

* colds, sniffles, flu

* aches & pains

#### Reason #2: Unable to find participants who will have 50% chance of having NO vitamin D for a while

#### Reason #3: Ethics

#### Reason #4 - If enough Vitamin D is given to make a difference, participants soon know which group they are in

People in RCT used to know that they were getting the trial drug because they had so many  **BAD side effects** 

People in RCT with Vitamin D know which group they are in because of so many  **GREAT side effects** 

 **Thus it is very difficult to blind the patients and doctors as to who is getting enough vitamin D**
