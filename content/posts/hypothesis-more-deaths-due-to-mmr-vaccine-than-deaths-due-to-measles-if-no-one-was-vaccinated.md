#### Measles vaccine math - Steve Kirsch

 **[Substack](https://kirschsubstack.com/p/measles-vaccine-math?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=548354&post_id=144969918&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=ofo3r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)** 

US deaths due to measles if no one was vaccinated and no drugs were given would be 450 / year 

Probably far fewer deaths if drugs were given to those few who got measles

 **Reader comments include** 

* " remember reading an old study (conducted by the WHO, I believe in the early 80's) which stated that merely giving African kids Vitamin A (as a treatment for measles) basically eliminated any risk of death from measles."

* "Let's not forget on the CA Dept of Health website TWO DAYS OF HIGH DOSE VITAMIN A is the treatment for measles..."
