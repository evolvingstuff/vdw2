Vitamin D3 regulates the absorption of calcium from food and water. The higher the dose of vitamin D3, the greater the amount of calcium that will be absorbed. Too much calcium is toxic to the kidneys and can cause kidney damage and even kidney failure.</p><p>Over the last three years of reviewing, blood results, I have noted that 2 out of every 100 people who have their calcium levels tested while not supplementing with any vitamin D3 or regularly sun bathing, have calcium levels that are outside of high normal range and so as such these excessively high amounts of calcium are damaging their kidneys. For this reason I recommend that all people who choose to supplement with vitamin D3 at any dose should have a serum calcium and ionic calcium blood test before supplementing with 10,000 IU.</p><p>People who take doses of Vitamin D3 above 10,000 iu per day need to eliminate milk, cheese, yogurt and excessive amount of seeds and nuts from their diet. All of these foods contain large amounts of calcium and are therefore dangerous for Vitamin D3 therapy patients. The consumption of at least 2.6 litres of fluids per day is also mandatory to insure that the kidneys are kept clear of accumulating calcium from other dietary sources likes green vegetables and eggs. During periods of extreme heat the fluid intake should be increased to 3 litres per day. Failure to follow these guidelines may lead to kidney damage or kidney failure.</p><p>Every three months while taking high doses of vitamin D3 it is important to have blood tests to make sure serum calcium levels and kidney function are within normal ranges. If calcium is outside of normal range then vitamin D3 should be discontinued or lowered significantly until a new blood test confirms calcium levels are once again within normal ranges.</p><p>The following blood tests need to be arranged every three to six months if taking 20,000 iu per day or above of Vitamin D3 per day.</p><ul><li><p>Serum Calcium</p></li><li><p>Urea</p></li><li><p>Creatinine</p></li><li><p>eGfR</p></li><li><p>Para Thyroid Hormone</p></li><li><p>Ionized calcium</p></li></ul><p>Serum calcium is less accurate than ionised calcium at measuring calcium in the blood.</p><p>It is very important to have a ionised calcium test performed without having eaten any food for 6 hours. Drink water only before blood sample is taken. Ionised calcium is more accurate than serum calcium as it measures calcium that is not bound to protein.</p><p>The longer calcium levels are outside the normal safe range the greater the extent of damage to the kidneys.</p><p>I have a small number of patients who had high ‘normal’ calcium results on just 10,000 iu per day and when they started 30,000 iu per day they went a little outside normal range. This can indicate pre-existing kidney disease , undiagnosed diabetes or a growth on the Para Thyroid gland. Symptoms of calcium toxicity only become evident when serum calcium is very far outside normal range for a month or more.</p><p>Calcium toxicity symptoms include mental confusion, severe nausea , total loss of appetite, abdominal pain, feeling terrible and knowing you need a hospital.</p><p>Excessive high serum calcium levels can also give you no symptoms at all for over 6 months until acute illness develops and hospitalization occurs. Please do not supplement with more than 20,000 iu per day of vitamin D3 without eliminating milk, cheese and yogurt from your diet or you risk flooding your blood with calcium which may result in kidney failure.</p><h4 id=the-critical-importance-of-pharmaceutical-grade-vitamin-k2>The Critical Importance of Pharmaceutical Grade Vitamin K2</h4><p>When Vitamin D3 is taken without clinically verified Vitamin K2, calcium becomes misplaced in the brain and this can give neurological symptoms that are indistinguishable from MS. In Europe and the USA there are no regulations governing the manufacture of Vitamin K2. This results in the market been flooded with vitamin K2 supplements that degrade within weeks of manufacture.</p><p>In India, Vitamin K2 manufacture is regulated in the same way as pharmaceuticals. An independent laboratory is requested by law to sign off on each stage of the manufacturing process. The Vitamin K2 from India remains stable for years. Only pharmaceutical grade K2 is used in clinical studies. Always supplement with 350 mcg of <a href=https://www.menaquinold.com>www.menaquinold.com</a> available from <a href=https://www.medikorlabs.com>www.medikorlabs.com</a>, failure to do so will result in misplaced calcium causing new diseases in the body.</p><p>I started using pharmaceutical grade Vitamin K2 in June 2018 <a href=https://www.menaquingold.com>www.menaquingold.com</a> and have seen it repeatedly reduce calcium levels (within 30 days) in my patients whose serum calcium levels were at highest normal or outside of normal range. No other Vitamin K2 supplements I have tested has produced such good results.</p><p>An osteoporosis case of mine, supplemented with 200 mcg of menaquingold K2 for 7 months and went for a dexa scan. The scan re classified her condition from osteoporosis, back to osteopina. Other Vitamin K2 supplements I have recommended have never delivered such impressive results.</p><p><strong>Since starting Personalised Vitamin D3 Therapy not one of my cases have been diagnosed with calcium toxicity or kidney failure.</strong></p><hr><h4 id=aug-2019-facebook-post-by-michael--cawley>Aug 2019 Facebook post by Michael Cawley</h4><p>A Warm Welcome To All New Members.</p><p>Michael Cawley is a MS survivor who was trained by neurologist Dr.Cicero Coimbra MD in the clinical use of the Coimbra Protocol in September 2016.</p><p>Within 6 months of assisting MS patients with the Coimbra Protocol the following serious problems were observed.</p><p>A) Vitamin D3 at 1000 iu per kg of body weight made many MS patients worse.When lower doses of Vitamin D3 were administered great benefits were observed.</p><p>B)The Coimbra Protocol treats all Vitamin D3 supplements as equal. After testing dozens of brands of Vitamin D3, I observed only five brands got consistently better results fighting MS. Most brands of Vitamin D3 either showed no benefits or made people worse.</p><p>C) Vitamin B2 supplementation made MS symptoms much worse in 50% of MS cases. The Coimbra Protocol treats all Vitamin B2 supplements as equal. After 2 years of testing dozens of brands of Vitamin B2/riboflavin only three brands consistently achieved life changing benefits.Most brands of B2 either showed no benefits or made people worse.</p><p>D) Magesium supplementation often caused MS symptoms to flare. This was sometimes due to the poor quality of magnesium supplements used as the Coimbra Protocol makes no suggestions as which are good magnesiums and which are poor quality. The worsening of MS symptoms after taking magnesium can also be caused by the magnesium interacting with toxic heavy metals in the brain and spine. The solution to this problem is the use of carefully selected heavy metal decontamination products.</p><p>E) The Coimbra Protocol suggests that calcium toxicity and kidney failure are almost unheard of once 2.5 litres of water are consumed daily and once all mandatory dietary restrictions are observed. Unfortunately I have been contacted by MS patients who suffered kidney failure while been administered Vitamin D3 by MD&rsquo;s using the Coimbra Protocol. While most of the Coimbra Protocol cases went into kidney failure after been told to take 2000 iu and even 4000 iu per kg of body weight of Vitamin D3 per day, one German patient had calcium toxicity on 1000 iu of Vitamin D3 per kg of body weight (60,000 iu per day) within 3 months of starting the Coimbra Protocol. As she was not advised by her doctor to stop taking Vitamin D3, three months later she was admitted to hospital with renal failure.</p><p>F) In the Coimbra Protocol, the level of Para Thyroid Hormone is considered invaluable as a tool to determine the correct dosage of Vitamin D3. This often leads the clinician to become fixated on the level of PTH when they should be fixated on how the patient is feeling taking vitamin D3. Often, in clinical practice patients will report remarkable improvements within hours or days, long before there is any change in Para Thyroid Hormone level. After reviewing hundreds of blood results for Para Thyroid Hormone level, Michael Cawley can see no connection between PTH level and patient response to treatment.</p><p>In Personalized Vitamin D3 therapy there is full disclosure to patients as to all possible adverse reactions to Vitamin D3 and its co- factors. All patients are encouraged to follow their body’s own wisdom as to what doses and brands work best for them. If any supplement causes a symptom to worsen that supplement is stopped or the dose reduced to allow all adverse reactions to immediately reverse.</p><p>I no longer support the use of the Coimbra Protocol as it fails to warn patients that all three parts of Vitamin D3 therapy can make MS and auto immune diseases worse.</p><p>Indeed MS patients have even been told to ignore their MS getting worse as part of &rsquo;their recovery'.</p><p>The Announcements area contains many posts from MS patients whose lives have been transformed by &lsquo;Personalised Vitamin D3&rsquo;</p><p>Learn how to safely use Vitamin D3 and it&rsquo;s co factors to fight your MS.</p><p>Skype Consultations information email <a href=mailto:cawleymjd@gmail.com>cawleymjd@gmail.com</a></p><p>None of the comments or posts in this group should be considered medical advice.
