#### Coronavirus vaccines, once free, are now pricey for uninsured people

 **[Washington Post - free](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/09/03/covid-vaccine-bridge-access-program-expires-cdc/?utm_campaign=wp_the7&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_the7&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3ee8ca9%2F66d6e9ee97ff550effc39143%2F596bdb5f9bbc0f403f990f33%2F57%2F95%2F66d6e9ee97ff550effc39143)** 

* "The program’s elimination marks the latest tear in a safety net that once ensured people could protect themselves against the coronavirus regardless of their financial situation. Health experts worry that the paltry 22 percent rate of adults staying up-to-date on vaccines will erode further. And they fear that the roughly 25 million people without health insurance in the nation will be especially vulnerable to covid because they tend to be in poorer health and avoid medical care when sick."

* "But it expired ahead of schedule because  **Congress rescinded $6.1 billion**  in coronavirus emergency spending authority as part of a deal to avert a government shutdown. Congress also declined to fund the Biden administration’s proposal for a Vaccines for Adults program that could provide routine immunizations, including for coronavirus, for free, similar to an existing Vaccines for Children program."

* "Private insurers, along with the Medicare and Medicaid government programs, are required to pay for coronavirus vaccines."

*  **In 2023, the median annual deductible for private industry workers participating in high deductible health plans (HDHPs) was <span style="color:#F06;">$2,500</span>** 

*  **"well over 30-40% of health plans likely have deductibles exceeding $1,000 based on the 2023 data showing 47% of small firm plans and 25% of large firm plans have deductibles of $2,000 or more""**
