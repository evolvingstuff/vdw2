BACKGROUND:

Deficiency of serum levels of vitamin D3 (se vitD), magnesium (se Mg) and calcium (se Ca) may be associated with increased exacerbation risk in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, associations with other aspects of COPD, e.g. lung function and quality of life (QoL), have been studied less extensively.

AIM:To investigate se vitD, se Mg and se Ca in COPD and their associations with both forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1) and QoL.

METHODS:FEV1 and se vitD (assessed by 25-(OH)-D3), se Mg and se Ca were measured during summertime. Generic and health related QoL were characterized.

RESULTS:

This cross-sectional study included 143 participants with COPD. Women had a significantly higher se vitD than men (P = 0.0028), and 27% of participants were se vitD deficient. FEV1 was not correlated with se vitD, se Mg or se Ca in COPD. Mg deficiency group reported significantly impaired mobility, usual activities, pain/discomfort and COPD-related QoL. Se vitD and se Ca were not associated with QoL.

CONCLUSION:

Serum levels of vitD, Mg and Ca were not related to FEV1. Most participants in this study were vitD-, Mg- and Ca sufficient. Women had higher se vitD than men. Se Mg, but not se vitD and se Ca, was associated with QoL in COPD. Prospective randomized studies are needed to substantiate these finding. Clinical trials ID at www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01564953.
