Objectives: To determine the rate of vitamin D supplementation in predominantly breastfed children. 

To identify patient characteristics, parental beliefs, and practitioner policies associated with supplementation. 

Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in a practice-based research network.

Network pediatricians completed a survey regarding their policy on vitamin D supplementation for breastfed infants. 

Parents of children 6 to 24 months old completed a survey on the initial type of feeding given to the child, length of breastfeeding, formula supplementation, and use of multivitamins. 

Parents indicated their level of agreement with statements regarding vitamin D supplementation. 

Results: Among 44 responding pediatricians, 36.4% indicated that they recommended vitamin D supplementation for all breastfed infants. 

A total of 2364 surveys were completed on age-eligible children; 1140 infants were breastfed for at least 6 months with little or no formula supplementation. 

 **The rate of vitamin D use for these infants was 15.9%.**  

Use of vitamin D was significantly associated with parental agreement that their child's pediatrician recommended supplementation (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>: 7.8), and that vitamins are unnecessary because breast milk has all needed nutrition (OR: 0.12). 

Among parents of predominantly breastfed infants who indicated that their child's doctor recommended vitamin D, 

44.6% gave the supplementation to their child. 

Conversely,  **67% of parents agreed that breast milk has all needed nutrition, and only 3% of these parents gave vitamin D to their children** . 

Conclusions: A minority of breastfed infants received vitamin D supplementation. 

Educational efforts directed at both physicians and parents are needed to increase compliance with vitamin D supplementation guidelines.
