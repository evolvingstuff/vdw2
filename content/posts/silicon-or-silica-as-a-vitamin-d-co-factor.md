### Silica is useful as a vitamin D co-factor in building bones, hair, teeth.

#### No consensus on bioavailability of the different forms of silica

#### No consensus on how much silica is needed

#### Some useful papers are attached to the bottom of this web page.

> "Average daily dietary intake of silicon is 20–50 mg for European and North American populations <sup>[14]</sup>. Daily intake of silicon is higher in China and India (140–200 mg/day) where grains, fruits, and vegetables form a larger part of the diet <sup>[52, 53]</sup>. China and India also have the lowest prevalence of hip fractures compared to all other regions of the world"

> "Diets containing more than 40 mg/day of silicon have been positively associated with increased femoral bone mineral density compared to dietary intake of less than 14 mg/day"

> "Silica is found not only in the earth’s crust, but also in the human body. It’s present in nearly all body tissue, including bone"

> "Too little silica can bring about calcification of connective and soft tissue, causing stiffness and loss of elasticity. Considered symptoms of aging, these issues may well be symptoms of silica deficiency. Hair, skin, and fingernail health is enhanced by silica as well."

> ..."you should aim to get at least 10 mg per day. To give you an example, a medium-sized banana contains about 6 mg of silica, and a carrot contains about 1.5 mg."
