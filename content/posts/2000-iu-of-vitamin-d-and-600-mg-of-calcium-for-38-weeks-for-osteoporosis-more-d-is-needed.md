Introduction

Treatment of calcium (Ca) and vitamin D (VD) deficiency (VDD) is crucial for health, especially in bone conditions, such as low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. Despite updates in clinical guideline recommendations, no studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of administering 2000 IU of cholecalciferol combined with calcium. Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate VD levels following treatment with Ca 600 mg/ cholecalciferol 2000 IU in real-life clinical practice.

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective, observational study included 302 adult patients receiving Ca 600 mg/D3 2000 IU orodispersible tablets, daily for ≥24 weeks. The primary outcome was 25-hydroxivitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> serum levels following treatment. Key secondary outcomes included changes in serum 25(OH)D levels and other bone metabolism (BM) parameters, safety and tolerability. The protocol was approved by a Research Ethics Committee.

Results

285 patients were evaluated (mean age <span>[SD]</span>: 67.4 <span>[12.6]</span> years old; 88.4 % women; basal serum 25(OH)D: 20.0 <span>[8.6]</span> ng/mL); 80.7 % reported previous history of osteoporosis/low BMD (osteopenia) and 37.2 % had received other Ca/VD prior to start study treatment. Median treatment duration was 38.5 weeks <span>[range 24.0–82.4]</span>. Overall, 94.4 % of patients increased serum 25(OH)D following treatment to a mean of 36.3 <span>[11.8]</span> ng/mL (p < 0.001 vs. baseline). Patients with basal VDD, significantly increased serum 25(OH)D to a mean over 30 ng/mL; no significant change found in repleted patients (basal 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/mL). PTH was significantly reduced after treatment, with no clinically relevant effect on serum Ca or phosphate. Three non-serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported. A post-hoc analysis on osteoporotic patients revealed virtually identical results in this population.

Conclusion

Treatment with Ca 600 mg/cholecalciferol 2000 IU for at least 24 weeks is effective and safe, especially in osteoporosis. Patients with VDD significantly increase plasma 25(OH)D to optimal range for bone health, with no clinically relevant changes on other bone metabolism parameters other than reducing secondary hyperparathyroidism. The magnitude of 25(OH)D increase directly correlates with the severity of VDD, with no effect in basally repleted patients.
