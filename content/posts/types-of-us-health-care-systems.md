## In the PPO the customer has the most to gain from being healthy, since there is an annual deductible

### [From Wikipedia Jan 2012](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_care#Preferred_Provider_Organization_.28PPO.29)

In terms of using such a plan, unlike an HMO plan, which has a copayment cost share feature (a nominal payment generally paid at the time of service), a PPO generally does not have a copay and instead offers a deductible and a coinsurance feature. The deductible must be paid in full before any benefits are provided. 

If the PPO plan is an 80% coinsurance plan with a $1,000 deductible, then the patient will pay 100% of the allowed provider fee up to $1,000. After this amount has been paid by the patient, the insurer will pay 80% of subsequent fees and the patient will pay the remaining 20%. 

 **Charges above the allowed amount are not payable by the patient or insurer but instead are written off as a discount by the physician.**

# [How much are you worth to HMOs?](http://www.healthnewsflorida.org/top_story/read/how_much_are_you_worth_to_an_hmo)

By their calculations, Medicare Advantage (HMO or similar managed-care plan) enrollees have a “value per member" of $6,000 in a merger or acquisition.

That compares with $1,500 for commercial plans – the ones that employers offer but in which the insurer takes the financial risks – and $1,200 per member for Medicaid plans.
