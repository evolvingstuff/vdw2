## The study:

* Ignored how much vitamin D was given - most of the studies used < 800 IU.

* Ignored if vitamin D2 vs Vitamin  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  was used - Vitamin D2 has far less benefit, and sometimes decreases the D3 levels

* Ignored how often the vitamin D dose was given - they included studies which used annual doses

* Ignored if Calcium or other cofactors were given

   *  **Only 5 of the 23 studies used >800 IU of vitamin D3 with Calcium** 

*  **6 studies actually found a benefit** 

   * but these benefits were cancelled out after averaging with the D2, no Calcium and low D3 studies

#### My guess as to why these titles were created

1. People like to read articles that support their world view: i.e. that vitamins do not help

> Note: there are many different world views: medicine, sports, crime, religion, global warming, raising children, race, war,  . . . . 

1. Article writers like to have lots of readers ( more readers ==> more advertising revenue)

1. Article writers often do not have the time to critique the science in studies in any case.

### Effects of vitamin D supplements on bone mineral density: a systematic review and meta-analysis

The Lancet, Early Online Publication, 11 October 2013, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61647-5C

Prof Ian R Reid MD a b i.reid@auckland.ac.nz , Mark J Bolland PhD a, Andrew Grey MD a b

Background: Findings from recent meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation without co-administration of calcium have not shown fracture prevention, possibly because of insufficient power or inappropriate doses, or because the intervention was not targeted to deficient populations. Despite these data, almost half of older adults (older than 50 years) continue to use these supplements. Bone mineral density can be used to detect biologically significant effects in much smaller cohorts. We investigated whether vitamin D supplementation affects bone mineral density.

Methods: We searched Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Database, from inception to July 8, 2012, for trials assessing the effects of vitamin D (D3 or D2, but not vitamin D metabolites) on bone mineral density. We included all randomised trials comparing interventions that differed only in vitamin D content, and which included adults (average age >20 years) without other metabolic bone diseases. We pooled data with a random effects meta-analysis with weighted mean differences and 95% CIs reported. To assess heterogeneity in results of individual studies, we used Cochran's Q statistic and the I2 statistic. The primary endpoint was the percentage change in bone mineral density from baseline.

Findings: Of 3930 citations identified by the search strategy, 23 studies (mean duration 23·5 months, comprising 4082 participants, 92% women, average age 59 years) met the inclusion criteria. 19 studies had mainly white populations. Mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was less than 50 nmol/L in eight studies (n=1791). In ten studies (n=2294), individuals were given vitamin D  **doses less than 800 IU per day** . Bone mineral density was measured at one to five sites (lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, trochanter, total body, or forearm) in each study, so 70 tests of statistical significance were done across the studies. There were 

*  **six findings of significant benefit,** 

* two of significant detriment, and the 

* rest were non-significant. 

Only one study showed benefit at more than one site. Results of our meta-analysis showed a small benefit at the femoral neck (weighted mean difference 0·8%, 95% CI 0·2—1·4) with heterogeneity among trials (I2=67%, p<0·00027). No effect at any other site was reported, including the total hip. We recorded a bias toward positive results at the femoral neck and total hip.

Interpretation: Continuing widespread use of vitamin D for osteoporosis prevention in community-dwelling adults without specific risk factors for vitamin D deficiency seems to be inappropriate.

### Comment by VitaminDWiki: It has been noticed for many years that

1. Often need more than 2,000 IU of vitamin  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  to PREVENT problems with bone health

1. Often need >4,000 IU of vitamin  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  to TREAT bone health problems

1. Calcium, Vitamin K-2, and Magnesium also improve bone health: vitamin D monotherapy is not enough

1. Too much Vitamin A reduces bone health

1. Enough Vitamin  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  reduces fractures: by improving bone health AND improving muscle reaction time so as to reduce falls

1. Once the bone bridges have been broken down, we should not expect to be able to rebuild them.
