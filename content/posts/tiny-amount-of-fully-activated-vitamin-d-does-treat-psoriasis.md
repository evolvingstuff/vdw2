Vitamin D treatment is effective when applied topically to the skin for plaque-type psoriasis. Oral vitamin D supplementation might be effective as an adjuvant treatment option in psoriasis. This umbrella review aimed to highlight the current knowledge regarding the use of oral vitamin D for treatment of patients with psoriasis. We performed a literature search and identified 107 eligible full-text articles that were relevant to the research interest. Among these, 10 review articles were selected, and data were extracted. 

A data synthesis showed that only a few studies monitored oral vitamin D efficacy in patients with psoriasis. No studies investigated the optimal dose of systemic vitamin D in psoriasis. 

However, most studies did not observe side effects for doses within a relatively narrow range  **0.25 to 2 μg/day** ). These results suggest that more large-scale studies are needed to determine the efficacy, optimal dose, and adverse effects of vitamin D administration in patients with psoriasis.
