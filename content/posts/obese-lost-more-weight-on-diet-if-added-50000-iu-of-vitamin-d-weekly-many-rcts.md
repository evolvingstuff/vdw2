 **VitaminDWiki suggests significantly more weight loss if any of the following** 

1. Started Vitamin D about 8 weeks before diet

1. Used more vitamin D

1. Used a gut-friendly form of Vitamin D

1. Started with Vitamin D loading dose

1. Included exercise - even walking

1. Intervention lasted longer

BACKGROUND & AIMS:

Low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) is common in obese people. Obesity is associated with a state of low-grade inflammation (meta-inflammation). There is increasing evidence indicating that vitamin D has anti-adipogenic activity and immunoregulatory effect. This study aimed to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on meta-inflammation and fat mass in obese subjects with vitamin D deficiency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 44 obese subjects with vitamin D deficiency (25OHD < 50 nmol/L) were assigned into vitamin D (a weight reduction diet + bolus weekly dose of 50000 IU vitamin D) or placebo group (weight reduction diet + edible paraffin weekly) for 12 weeks. Weight, fat mass and serum levels of 25OHD, Calcium, Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were assessed before and after the intervention.

RESULTS:

Vitamin D supplementation resulted in significant increase of serum 25OHD level (P<0.001), and significant decrease in PTH (P<0.001), MCP-1 (p<0.05), IL-1β (p< 0.05), and TLR-4 (P<0.05); compared to the baseline values in vitamin D group. Weight, BMI and fat mass decreased in both groups (P<0.05). Between the groups, there were significant decrease in weight, fat mass and serum MCP-1 concentrations and significant increase in serum 25OHD and PTH concentrations after intervention with vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo (p<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:

Improvement in vitamin D status in obese subjects with vitamin D deficiency in combination weight loss diet resulted in weight, fat mass, and MCP-1 decrease. Weight loss and vitamin D supplementation may act synergistically to reduce levels of meta-inflammation.

#### Lost more weight with 50,000 IU Vitamin D weekly and daily Calcium - RCT Nov 2018

 **A high weekly dose of cholecalciferol and calcium supplement enhances weight loss and improves health biomarkers in obese women.** 

Nutr Res. 2018 Nov;59:53-64. [doi: 10.1016/j.nutres.2018.07.011.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2018.07.011.) Epub 2018 Jul 25.

Obesity, a chronic condition associated with several life-threatening diseases, affects a significant proportion of the global population and has long been associated with vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of both obesity and vitamin D deficiency has increased dramatically in Jordan in recent decades, especially among women. Few studies in Jordan and the surrounding area address this issue. In this study, we hypothesize that calcium and vitamin D have beneficial effects on weight reduction and metabolic profile in obese women. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of vitamin D3 and calcium supplementation on anthropometric measurements and some blood metabolites. Forty-five obese female subjects with vitamin D deficiency were recruited by a dietitian and randomly assigned to the same weight loss diet in addition to the following treatments (4 groups): control (CON), no prescribed supplements; vitamin D3 (Diet/D), given a high weekly dose of cholecalciferol (50 000 IU/subject/week); calcium (Diet/Ca), given 1200 mg/dL calcium/subject/day; vitamin D3 plus Ca (Diet/Ca/D), given cholecalciferol (50 000 IU/subject/week) and calcium (1200 mg/dL calcium/subject/day). 

Results revealed that after 3 months of supplementation, the Diet/Ca/D group subjects experienced a significant reduction (P ≤ .05) in 

* weight (10.49 kg), 

* BMI (4.61 ± 2 kg/m2), 

* waist circumference (11.41 ± 8.9 cm), 

* body fat percentage (2.43 ± 1.7%), 

* FBG (25.81 ± 11.4 mg/dL), 

* PTH (27.58 ± 8.9 pg/mL), 

* cholesterol (0.56 ± 0.2 mmol/L), and

* triglycerides (0.53 ± 0.21 mmol/L) 

when compared to the Diet/Ca and the CON groups. Interestingly, however, the CON group showed a significant increase in serum PTH concentration (9.51 ± 3.8 pg/mL, P ≤ .05). Based on these results, a combined Ca and vitamin D3 supplement appears to enhance weight loss and improve some of the blood metabolic profiles in obese women subjected to a weight loss diet, thus supporting our study hypothesis.
