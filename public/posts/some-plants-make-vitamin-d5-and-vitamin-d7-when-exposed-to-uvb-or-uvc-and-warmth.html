Vitamin D deficiency is a global issue that requires attention, given its essential functions in the human body. The synthesis of vitamin D3 in the human skin is subject to limitations related to the availability of UV radiation, which can be particularly limited at higher latitudes, especially during the winter months. Additionally, Vitamin D3 can be acquired through diet. Given that most vitamin D sources are animal-based, the discovery of vitamin D3 in plants is of particular interest to those following vegan or vegetarian diets. While the characteristics of vitamin D biosynthesis in the human skin are well established, there is a lack of knowledge regarding biosynthesis in plants. 

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of several factors, including light, temperature, and plant matrix compounds, on the vitamin D3 conversion reaction. The formation of previtamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) was demonstrated to be dependent on UVC and UVB light, while the subsequent formation of vitamin D3 from previtamin D3 was shown to be dependent on temperature. Exposure to longer UV wavelengths led to a relative increase in lumisterol content. Furthermore, a concentration-dependent effect of UV-absorbing compounds was observed. These novel insights into the formation of vitamin D3 will underpin future strategies aimed at optimising vitamin D3 content in crop species.

It has been demonstrated that plants can accumulate and contain 

* vitamin D3, 

* vitamin D5 (sitocalciferol) and 

* vitamin D7 (campecalciferol) &lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

So far, especially plants of the Solanaceae family, such as tomatoes, have been shown to contain vitamin D derivates &lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;. Biosynthetically, 7-DHC is produced as part of phytosterol metabolism, specifically in the pathway from cycloartenol to cholesterol &lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;. During exposure to UV light, 7-DHC is not only enzymatically converted to cholesterol, but also photochemically converted to vitamin D3

Vitamin D deficiency is a global issue that requires attention, given its essential functions in the human body. The synthesis of vitamin D3 in the human skin is subject to limitations related to the availability of UV radiation, which can be particularly limited at higher latitudes, especially during the winter months. Additionally, Vitamin D3 can be acquired through diet. Given that most vitamin D sources are animal-based, the discovery of vitamin D3 in plants is of particular interest to those following vegan or vegetarian diets. While the characteristics of vitamin D biosynthesis in the human skin are well established, there is a lack of knowledge regarding biosynthesis in plants. 
This study aimed to evaluate the influence of several factors, including light, temperature, and plant matrix compounds, on the vitamin D3 conversion reaction. The formation of previtamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) was demonstrated to be dependent on UVC and UVB light, while the subsequent formation of vitamin D3 from previtamin D3 was shown to be dependent on temperature. Exposure to longer UV wavelengths led to a relative increase in lumisterol content. Furthermore, a concentration-dependent effect of UV-absorbing compounds was observed. These novel insights into the formation of vitamin D3 will underpin future strategies aimed at optimising vitamin D3 content in crop species.
