Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15(6), 1103; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15061103

* Measured Vitamin D levels of Caucasian cohorts in England at age 46

* Ignoring those who had developed asthma by age 46

* Noticed how many started to have asthma by age 50

* Compared to those with < 10 ng of Vitamin D

> Those with > 30 ng of Vitamin D were  **30% less likely to become asthmatic** 

> If >30 ng  of Vitamin D AND low atopic (= low response to allergens)

> &nbsp; &nbsp;then person was  **54% less likely to develop asthma** 

 **Note: Raw data showed increase in likelihood of adult-onset asthma if** 

* Obese

* No fatty fish in diet

* Had occupational dust 

* Smoked at age 42

 **Atopy Model Adjustments** 

*  **Model 1** ¶ Adjusted for sex and season; 

*  **Model 2**  # additionally adjusted for smoking status at age 42, TV and PC time, physical activity at age 42, outdoor activity at age 46, oily fish consumption, vitamin D supplementation at age 46, region of residence at age 46, occupational social class at birth (father’s occupation) and at age 46; 

*  **Model 3** ¥ additionally adjusted BMI, BMI squared, waist circumference, waist circumference squared.
