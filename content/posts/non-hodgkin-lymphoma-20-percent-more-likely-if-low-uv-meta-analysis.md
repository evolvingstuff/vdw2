#### Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurs when your lymphocytes don't die

Normally, lymphocytes go through a predictable life cycle. Old lymphocytes die, and your body creates new ones to replace them.

In non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, your lymphocytes don't die, and your body keeps creating new ones. This oversupply of lymphocytes crowds into your lymph nodes, causing them to swell. [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/non-hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375680)
