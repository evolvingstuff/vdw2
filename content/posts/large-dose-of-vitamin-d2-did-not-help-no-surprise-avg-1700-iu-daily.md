#### Large Doses of Vitamin D Fail to Increase 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels or to Alter Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Obese Adolescents: A Pilot Study

Journal of Adolescent Health, doi:10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.02.006

 **Highlights** 

* Obese adolescents were randomized to vitamin D2 (150,000 IU) or placebo for 24 weeks.

* Treatment with large doses of vitamin D2 failed to increase 25OH vitamin D levels.

* Treatment with vitamin D2 failed to alter inflammatory markers or lipids.

It is amazing that human doctors persist in trying to use Vitamin D2

Animal doctors (vets) agreed 10 years ago that Vitamin D2 should not be used on any mammal.

They had found too many problems with vitamin D2

Also, D2 does not raise vitamin D levels nearlty as much D3 does

Also, D2 has a very short half life - which is measured in days, not months

Purpose

Vitamin D deficiency and cardiometabolic risk factors are common in obese adolescents. Observational studies demonstrate an inverse relationship among serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammatory cytokines. This pilot study explores if vitamin D supplementation could reduce serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin <span>[IL]</span> 6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor α), adiponectin, lipids, hemoglobin A1C, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). A secondary aim was to determine the associations between baseline serum 25OHD concentrations and body mass index (BMI), hs-CRP, inflammatory cytokines, and lipids.

Methods

Overweight and obese adolescents enrolled in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind study were given 150,000 IU ergocalciferol or placebo at baseline and 12 weeks. Outcome measurements included serum 25OHD, inflammatory cytokines, adiponectin, hs-CRP, lipids, hemoglobin A1C, and BMI at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks.

Results

Of 40 participants, 31 (78%) completed the study. Mean ± standard error 25OHD levels were similar in vitamin D and placebo groups at baseline (19.6 ± 5.3 vs. 25.8 ± 10.8 ng/mL) and 24 weeks (20.1 ± 3.4 vs. 24.6 ± 8.4 ng/mL). Inflammatory and cardiovascular markers were not significantly different between groups at 24 weeks. Serum 25OHD at baseline was associated with BMI (r = −.44 <span>[95% confidence interval, −.66 to −.15]</span>) but not with other outcome measures.

Conclusions

Supplementation with vitamin D at 150,000 IU every 3 months failed to increase serum 25OHD or alter inflammatory markers and lipids in overweight and obese youth. Further studies are needed to establish the dose of vitamin D required to increase 25OHD and determine potential effects on metabolic risk factors in obese teens.
