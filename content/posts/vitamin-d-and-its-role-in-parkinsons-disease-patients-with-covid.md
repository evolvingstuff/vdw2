A novel coronavirus reportedly called 2019-nCoV started to spread around the world at the end of 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was later renamed after links with SARS were observed. Multiple studies have reported possible connections between the COVID-19 virus and neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease. Theories support that vitamin D deficiency plays a part in the pathogenicity of Parkinson’s disease or the credibility of the associated dopamine system. Administration of vitamin D3 was shown to significantly enhance the motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson’s disease and enhance the quality of life. Also, multiple recent reviews have shown specific ways in which vitamin D reduces the risk of pathogenic infections. Recent studies supported the potential role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections and mortality. On the immunological level, immune response regulation remains one of the well- recognized actions of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Parkinson’s disease. Whereas more studies are required, Vitamin D supplementation with a moderate and well-calculated dosage of vitamin D3 in patients with Parkinson’ s disease can help minimize the risk and burden of COVID-19 complications.
