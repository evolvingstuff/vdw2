* "While migraine affects approximately 11.7% (Lipton et al., 2007) of the general population, studies have found migraine in 19.8-82% of MS patients, and migraine is also the most commonly observed type of headache in cases of MS (Nicoletti et al., 2008; Vacca et al., 2007)"

* "This coexistence is important because the rate of relapse was reported to increase in MS patients with migraine (Kowalec et al., 2017), and this relationship may also have negative effects on patients (Marrie, 2017)"

#### MS + Migraines have the worst blood levels

Background: Migraine coexistence, which is high in multiple sclerosis (MS), is reported. To better understand the etiology of the coexistence of MS and migraine and the outcomes of this relationship, the vitamin D, vitamin D-binding protein (VITDBP), vitamin D receptor (VITDR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) values were examined in patients with the coexistence of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and migraine.

Methods: This study was conducted between January 1, 2019, and July 25, 2019, at the neurology and biochemistry clinics of two different tertiary hospitals simultaneously. Overall, 50 RRMS patients with migraine, 50 RRMS patients without migraine, and 50 healthy volunteers were included in the study. The participants' vitamin D, VITDBP, VITDR, hs-CRP, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, TAS, TOS, and OSI values were measured.

Results: The vitamin D and VITDR values of the RRMS patients with migraine were lower than those of the RRMS patients without migraine (respectively, p = 0.014, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the RRMS patients with and without migraine in terms of their VITDBP values (p = 0.570). The SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and TAS values of the RRMS patients with migraine were lower than those without migraine (all p < 0.001). The hs-CRP and TOS values of the RRMS patients with migraine were higher than those without migraine (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic to date. Based on the results, our study may shed light on the etiopathogenesis of the coexistence of MS and migraine and new treatments. However, more studies are needed to better understand the etiology of this relationship and its negative effects.
