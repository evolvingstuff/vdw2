#### The More COVID Shots You Get, the More Likely You’ll Get COVID. Here’s Why.

 **[Childrens Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-booster-lowered-immunity-infections-cola/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=860f34cb-4036-4ddb-8ad2-b49ad0da72c7)** 

* "“The term ‘original antigenic sin’ was  **first used in the 1960s**  to describe how one’s first exposure to influenza virus shapes the outcome of subsequent exposures to antigenically related strains. In the decades that have passed, OAS-like responses have been shown to play an integral role in both protection from and susceptibility to infections"

* "“OAS describes the phenomenon whereby the development of immunity against pathogens/Ags is shaped by the first exposure to a related pathogen/Ag … subsequent infections with similar influenza virus strains preferentially boost the Ab response against the original strain …"

* "“Some experts say they are concerned that frequent boosting with the original version of the vaccine may have inadvertently exacerbated immune imprinting. At this point in the pandemic, some adults have received four or more doses of the same vaccine …"

* "Where this matters is if you keep giving booster doses with <span>[original]</span> strain, and continue to lock people into that original response. It makes it harder for them to respond then to essentially a completely different virus,’ says Dr. Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Philadelphia …

* "It is true that the best boosts typically are the ones that are given infrequently, that immunologically, if you boost too much and too frequently, then you often have a lower immune response at the end,’ said <span>[director of the center for virology and vaccine research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dr. Dan]</span> Barouch.”
