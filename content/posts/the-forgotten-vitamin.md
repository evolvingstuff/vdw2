**** The forgotten vitamin. **** 

A talk by Oliver Gillie on Vitamin D.

Sunday 8th May 2011 at 6.30 pm

Stationers Park Community Centre

60 Mayfield Road London N8 9LP

'Lack of sunshine and the vitamin D it makes in our skin is probably the most serious single cause of disease in the UK today'

Vitamin D deficiency is well known as the classic cause of rickets and bone disease, but in the last 10 years new research has identified it

as a major risk factor for many illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, many cancers, and even the common cold and flu virus.

Oliver Gillie is a freelance medical researcher. Formerly the medical correspondent of 'The Sunday Times' and 'The Independent'.

His work over the last 7 years has been to pass on information about vitamin D deficiency disease to doctors, scientists and journalists.

He has lobbied governments and organisations such as Cancer Research to change their policies and advice to the public on safe sun exposure.
