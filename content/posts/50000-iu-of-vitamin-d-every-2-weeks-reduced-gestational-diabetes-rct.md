Context: Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent throughout the world. Pregnant women, neonates, and infants form the most vulnerable groups for vitamin D deficiency.

Objective: 1) To find the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women. 2) To evaluate the effect of supplementation with cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D levels in pregnant women and evaluate its correlation with feto-maternal outcome.

Design: Randomized control trial from the years 2010-2012.

Setting: Tertiary care center, Delhi, India.

Participants: 180 pregnant women. The study population was divided randomly into 2 groups; Group A: non-intervention (60 women) and Group B: intervention (120 women).

Intervention: The intervention group received supplementation of vitamin D in dosages depending upon 25(OH)-D levels.

Main Outcome Measures: Risk of maternal complications like Preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes associated with Vitamin D deficiency and risk of Low birth weight and poor APGAR score in infants of mothers with Vitamin D deficiency.

Results: Adjusted serum 25(OH)-D concentration was lower in group A as compared to group B (mean 46.11 ± 74.21 nmol/L vs 80 ± 51.53 nmol/L). 44% of patients in group A and 20.3% of patients in group B developed Pre-term labor/Pre-eclampsia/Gestational Diabetes. New-borns of mothers in group A had lower cord blood levels of 25(OH)-D levels as compared to group B (mean 43.11 ± 81.32 nmol/L vs 56.8 ± 47.52 nmol/L). They also had lower birth weight of mean 2.4 ± 0.38 kg as compared to group B 2.6 ± 0.33 kg.

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of maternal comorbidities and helps improve neonatal outcomes.
