 **Possible reasons for early-onset include:** 

1. “…aggressive tumours are sometimes particularly adept at suppressing the body’s immune responses to cancer,…”

1. “Disruptions in microbiome composition, such as those caused by dietary changes or antibiotics, have been linked to inflammation and increased risk of several diseases, including some forms of cancer”

1. “Research has shown that cancers can arise many years after an exposure to a carcinogen, such as asbestos or cigarette smoke. “If the latent period is decades, then where do you look?”
