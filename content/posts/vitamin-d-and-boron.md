Boron is an essential mineral that plays an important role in several biological processes. Boron is required for growth of plants, animals, and humans. There are increasing evidences of this nutrient showing a variety of pleiotropic effects, ranging from 

* anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects to the 

* modulation of different body systems. 

In the past few years, the trials showed disease-related polymorphisms of boron in different species, which has drawn attention of scientists to the significance of boron to health. 

Low boron profile has been related with 

* poor immune function, 

* increased risk of mortality, 

* osteoporosis, and 

* cognitive deterioration. 

High boron status revealed injury to cell and toxicity in different animals and humans. Some studies have shown some benefits of higher boron status, but findings have been generally mixed, which perhaps accentuates the fact that dietary intake will benefit only if supplemental amount is appropriate. The health benefits of boron are numerous in animals and humans; for instance, it affects the growth at safe intake. 

Central nervous system shows improvement and immune organs exhibit enhanced immunity with boron supplementation. 

Hepatic metabolism also shows positive changes in response to dietary boron intake. Furthermore, animals and human fed diets supplemented with boron reveal 

* improved bone density and other benefits including 

* embryonic development, 

* wound healing, and 

* cancer therapy. 

It has also been reported that boron affects the metabolism of several enzymes and minerals. In the background of these health benefits, low or high boron status is giving cause for concern. Additionally, researches are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms of boron effects, and determine the requirements in different species.

#### Pivotal role of boron supplementation on bone health: A narrative review - Dec 2020

Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology Vol. 62, Dec. 2020, 126577; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2020.126577

Author links open overlay panelMariangelaRondanelliabMilena AnnaFalivacGabriellaPeronicVittoriaInfantinobClaraGasparricGiancarloIannellodSimonePernaeAntonellaRivafGiovannaPetrangolinifAliceTartarac

Background

Boron is a trace element that plays an important role in numerous biological functions, including calcium metabolism, growth and maintenance of bone tissue. However, there are still no precise indications regarding a possible role of boron supplementation, and its amount of supplementation, to maintain bone health. So the aim of this narrative review was to consider the state of the art on the effectiveness of boron supplementation (alone or with other micronutrients) on growth and maintenance of bone in humans through control of calcium, vitamin D and sex steroid hormone metabolism in order to suggest a daily dosage of boron supplementation.

Main findings

This review included 11 eligible studies: 7 regarding the supplementation with boron alone and 4 regarding supplementation with boron and other nutrients. Despite the number of studies considered being low, the number of subjects studied is high (594) and the results are interesting.

Conclusions

The studies considered in this narrative review have evaluated the positive effectiveness on bone, in humans, through control of calcium, vitamin D and sex steroid hormone metabolism, considering a dietary supplementation of 3 mg/day of boron (alone or with other nutrients); this supplementation is demonstrably useful to support bone health (in order to prevent and maintain adequate bone mineral density), also considering the daily dose of 3 mg is much lower than the Upper Level indicated by EFSA in the daily dose of 10 mg.

* Many geography and arthritis examples

* "Incidentally ALL SPAS reputedly curing arthritis have very high Borax levels"

* "many patients with arthritis commonly experienced a Herxheimer reaction, which is an early aggravation of symptoms with increased pain for a short period of time (you may feel worse before you feel better). It is commonly due to toxins being released by killed Candida and mycoplasma.

* :The beneficial effect of Boron on bones seems to be due to two interrelated effects: a higher Boron content of the bones which makes them harder, and a normalization of sex hormones which stimulates the growth of new bone. Low estrogen levels after menopause are thought to be the main reason why so many older women develop osteoporosis."

* "For Boron to be fully effective in reversing tissue calcification ample magnesium is required. For older individuals 400 to 600 mg of magnesium together with the  **daily Boron supplementation spaced out during the day** ."

* "CURRENTLY I AM  SUPPLEMENTING WITH LIQUID IONIC BORON [http://www.healthshop101.com/boron.html](http://www.healthshop101.com/boron.html) "

* "Boron is for the parathyroids what iodine is for the thyroid."

* "Boron deficiency causes the parathyroids to become overactive, releasing too much parathyroid hormone which raises the blood calcium by grabbing it from bones and teeth. This then leads to osteoarthritis and other forms of arthritis, osteoporosis and tooth decay."

   * "In a double-blind study conducted in Australia, 20 patients with confirmed osteoarthritis were given a placebo or a supplement providing 6 mg of boron daily for 8 weeks; 15 patients completed the study.15 Of the 7 patients consuming the boron supplement, 5 reported improved subjective measures for their arthritic condition (eg, less pain on movement), whereas only 1 of 8 patients consuming the placebo reported an improvement in their arthritic condition"

   * "Patients with mild to moderate arthritis supplemented daily with 6 mg of boron as calcium fructoborate (a naturally occurring boron complex commonly found in fruits and vegetables) reported markedly reduced pain. By week 8, 80% of the test participants reduced or eliminated their use of painkillers. Joint rigidity essentially disappeared, and mobility was markedly increased at 8 weeks."

   * "Considerable evidence exists to support the contention that boron has a beneficial (if not an essential) function, influencing especially trabecular and alveolar bone growth and maintenance"
