#### Vitamin D Half-Life is '1-6 weeks''

Half-life: the time till half of the quantity still exists

Example: Start with 30 ng of vitamin D and half-life of 6 weeks, then 15 ng at 6 weeks

#### Half-life varies with:

* Vitamin D level

* Vitamin D Source: guesses for 20 ng (shorter half-life for >50 ng)

> 6 weeks: Sun/UV

> 3 weeks: D3 supplements 

> 1 week: D2 supplements 

* 1-2 day: Trauma/surgery

#### Half-life might also vary with such things as:

* Sickness - especially inflammation 2 days?

* [Amount of Calcium in bloodstream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28139795)

* Race

* Obesity

* Type of food

* Ratio of UVB to UVA - [Excess UVA appears to decrease Vitamin D](/posts/uva-decreased-vitamin-d-levels-again)

#### [Wikipedia - Biological half-life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_half-life)

Clinical practice: 4 to 5 X the half-life to reach steady state

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example:  4X 2-6 week ==> 2-6 month to reach steady state

#### It appears that

@ 10 nanograms: half-life (sun) = about 12 weeks

@ 50 nanograms: half-life (sun) = about 2 week

#### VitaminDWiki has a chart that summarized half-life circa 2014

#### 25 day half-life of 16 ng vitamin D (used stable-isotope labeled molecules) – June 2014

 **25(OH)D2 half-life is shorter than 25(OH)D3 half-life and is influenced by DBP concentration and genotype.**

Medical Research Council (MRC) Human Nutrition Research, Cambridge, UK.

Context: There is uncertainty over the equivalence of vitamins D2 and D3 to maintain plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). 

Objective: To compare the plasma half-lives of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 in two distinct populations with different dietary calcium intake and 25(OH)D status. 

Participants: Healthy men (aged 24 and 39 years), resident in The Gambia (n=18) or UK (n=18). Interventions: Oral tracer dose of deuterated-25(OH)D2 and deuterated-25(OH)D3 (both 40 nmol). Blood samples were collected over 33 days. 

Main outcome measures: 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 plasma half-lives, concentrations of 25(OH)D and DBP and DBP genotypes. 

Results: 25(OH)D2 half-life (mean (SD)) (13.9 (2.6) d) was shorter than 25(OH)D3 half-life (15.1 (3.1) d; P=0.001) for countries combined, and in Gambians (12.8 (2.3) d vs. 14.7 (3.5) d; P<0.001), but not in the UK (15.1 (2.4) d vs. 15.6 (2.5) d; P=0.3). 

25(OH)D concentration was 69 (13) and 29 (11) nmol/L (P<0.0001) and DBP concentration was 259 (33) and 269 (23) mg/l (P=0.4) in The Gambia and UK, respectively. 

Half-lives were positively associated with plasma DBP concentration for countries combined: (25(OH)D2 half-life: regression coefficient (SE) 0.03 (0.01) d per 1 mg/l DBP; P=0.03; 25(OH)D3 half-life: 0.04 (0.02) d; P=0.02) and in Gambians (25(OH)D2 half-life: 0.04 (0.01) d; P=0.02; 25(OH)D3 half-life: 0.06 (0.02) d; P=0.01), but not in UK participants. 

DBP concentration*country interactions were not significant. DBP Gc1f/1f homozygotes had shorter 25(OH)D2 half-lives compared to other combined genotypes (P=0.007), after correction for country. 

Conclusions: 25(OH)D2 half-life was shorter than 25(OH)D3 half-life, and half-lives were affected by DBP concentration and genotype. Stable isotope 25(OH)D half-life measurements provide a novel tool to investigate vitamin D metabolism and vitamin D expenditure, and aid in the assessment of vitamin D requirements.

 **Comment by VitaminDWiki** 

There is no indication in the abstract as to the pre-existing vitamin D blood levels.

They apparently added 16 ug (640 IU) stable isotope labelled molecules D2 and D3
