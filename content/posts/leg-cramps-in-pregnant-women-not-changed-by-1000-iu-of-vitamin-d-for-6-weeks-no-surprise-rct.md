It is very unlikely that only 1,000 IU for only 6 weeks could improve any condition

It is an interesting idea however.

Background: This study intended to determine the effects of Vitamin D and calcium?Vitamin D in treating leg cramps in pregnant women. 

Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial on 126 participants, 18–35 year-old pregnant women with a minimum of two leg cramps per week who were referred to health-care centers in Tabriz Iran in 2013. The participants were allocated to three 42 member groups using a randomized block design. For 42 days, the intervention groups took a 1000 unit Vitamin D pill or 300 mg calcium carbonate plus a 1000 unit Vitamin D pill, and the control group received a placebo pill every day. The participants were evaluated with regard to the frequency, length, and pain intensity of leg cramps during the week before and during the 3rd and 6th week of the intervention. The ANCOVA and repeated measurement test were used to analyze the data. 

Results: Results showed that controlling for the effects before the intervention, calcium?Vitamin D, and Vitamin D supplements had no effect on the frequency, length, and pain intensity of leg cramps. 

Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the calcium?Vitamin D and the Vitamin D supplements have no effect on the frequency, length, and pain intensity of leg cramps during the 6 weeks of the study .
