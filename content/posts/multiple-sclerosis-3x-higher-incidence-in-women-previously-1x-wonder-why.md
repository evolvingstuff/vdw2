#### Initially came across this report which mentioned  changing MS sex ratio

 **Environmental factors and multiple sclerosis - 2008** 

" In native-born Canadians, estimated female-to-male ratios changed from 1 in the early 1900s to 3·5; <sup>[31]</sup> a similar increase is seen in European migrants to Canada (Ebers, Orton, and Sadovnick, unpublished data). Notably, this increase began long before the introduction of oral contraceptives, refrigeration, or perhaps the increase in popularity of smoking in women. In Scotland, a similar change is more recent, the ratio being at unity in the 1950s <sup>[53]</sup> but now exceeding 3. These findings further indicate that individuals who have the same genetic background change their risk of MS through environmental differences."

" **Results:**  Adjusted sex ratios showed a significant increase from the first to the last decade in the whole MS sample (from 2.35 to 2.73; p = 0.03) and in the subgroups belonging to the areas between 83u N and 45u N (from 1.93 to 4.55; p,0.0001) and between 45u N to 35u N (from 1.46 to 2.30; p,0.05) latitude, while a sex ratio stability over time was found in the subgroup from areas between 12u S and 55u S latitude. The sex ratio increase mainly affected relapsing-remitting (RR) MS."

#### Sex Ratio of Multiple Sclerosis - 2013

 **[By Sreeram Ramagopalan](http://www.patientcareonline.com/infection/sex-ratio-multiple-sclerosis)** 

* "This intriguing epidemiological phenomenon warrants particular attention because the sex ratio of MS parallels MS incidence, and the increasing frequency of MS among females is a key driver of the increasing prevalence of this devastating disorder worldwide. A change that occurs within a century is too short a time for a genetic cause. This suggests that environmental factor/s are at work in a sex-specific manner."

* Speculates on various reasons, discounts each reason, has no data

#### Questions by the founder of VitaminDWiki

1. How had I not been aware of the changes in MS sex ratio before Aug 2018?

1. Women appear to be at increased risk of getting  **RR**  MS - Is it a different form?

1. Women appear to be at [increased risk of other autoimmune diseases](/posts/autoimmune-diseases-occur-more-often-in-women-than-men) - has Autoimmune ratio also changed?

1. Are women wanting lighter color of skin and staying out of the sun more?

1. Might it be associated with the widespread use of birth control pills?

1. Might it be associated with fewer births? (see following item)
