#### [WEBINAR: Clinical Controversies in Vitamin D Testing and Treatment](https://www.labroots.com/ms/webinar/id/192/Diasorin-feb29?)

 **Dr. Gregory Plotnikoff, MD, MTS, FACP** 

Minnesota Personalized Medicine, Minnesota Natural Medicine 

Clinical Controversies Recently, both national and international authorities have promulgated conflicting statements on vitamin D testing and treatment. What are clinicians and patients to do?

This webinar will address the existing data so that participants can answer these five key clinical questions:

* Who might be at risk for low vitamin D? 

* Can we assess for vitamin D deficiency by physical exam? 

* Is a multivitamin or prenatal vitamin sufficient?

* What are the best means to assure sufficient vitamin D levels?

* What research questions still need to be answered?

* Sufficient time will be available for a live question and answer period for all real-time participants.
