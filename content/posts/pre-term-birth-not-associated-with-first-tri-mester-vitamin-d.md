We assessed if first-trimester vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in women who experienced a spontaneous preterm birth compared with women who delivered at term. We conducted a nested case-control study of pregnant women who had previously given blood for first-trimester combined screening for trisomy 21 and subsequently delivered at a tertiary hospital between November 2004 and July 2009. From an overall cohort of 4225 women, 40 cases of spontaneous preterm birth (? 23 (0)/ (7) and ? 34 (6)/ (7) weeks) were matched by race/ethnicity with 120 women delivering at term (? 37 (0)/ (7) weeks) with uncomplicated pregnancies. Banked maternal serum was used to measure maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>. 

The prevalence of first-trimester maternal vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L](25(OH)D%20<%2050%20nmol/L) was comparable among women who subsequently delivered preterm compared with controls (7.5% versus 6.7%, P = 0.90). 

The median 25(OH)D level for all subjects was 89 nmol/L (interquartile range, 73 to 106 nmol/L). Seventy-three percent (117/160) of the cohort had sufficient vitamin D levels (25(OH)D ? 75 nmol/L). In a cohort of pregnant women with mostly sufficient levels of first-trimester serum 25(OH)D, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with spontaneous preterm birth.

## The median of this study was 35.6 ng/ml

# Seems odd – most other studies show that pregnant women have much lower levels of vitamin D
