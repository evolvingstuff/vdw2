Vitamin D helps to balance the levels of calcium and phosphorus to maintain proper bone structure. It is also involved in essential biological roles and displays a wide spectrum of potential benefits in the human body. Since there are many types of fractures that occur at specific ages and due to different circumstances, the influence of vitamin D on the frequency of a particular fracture may differ. 

Thus, the authors investigated the possible preventive effect of vitamin D on the risks of 

* vertebral fractures, 

* hip fractures, 

* stress fractures and 

* pediatric fractures. 

Additional aspects of vitamin D, especially on recuperation after injures and its impact on the severity of particular fractures, were also discussed. 

It was suggested that vitamin D supplementation may contribute to a reduction in  **hip fracture**  risk due to 

1. reduced bone turnover, 

1. decreased frequency of falls and 

1. improved muscle function. 

Furthermore, vitamin D appears to 

* lower the risk of stress fractures in athletes and military recruits. 

Due to a nonunified protocol design, presented investigations show inconsistencies between vitamin D supplementation and a decreased risk of vertebral fractures. However, a vitamin D preventive effect on pediatric fractures seems to be implausible.
