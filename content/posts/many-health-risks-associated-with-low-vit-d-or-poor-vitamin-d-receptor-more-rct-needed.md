* Paper correctly believes that Vitamin D prevents/treats many health problems

   * but that Vitamin D has a problem of increasing Calcium in the body

* Their goal is to invent expensive Vitamin D analogs which might not increase Calcium

* Far lower cost solutions which have been used for over a decade include:

1. Reduce Calcium intake and Increase water to flush the Calcium out of the body

1. Increase Vitamin K2 to decrease excess Calcium from being deposited where it is harmful
