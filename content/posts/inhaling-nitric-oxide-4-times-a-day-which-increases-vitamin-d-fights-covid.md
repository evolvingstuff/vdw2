#### Real-World Study at Srinakharinwirot University Bangkok: Accumulating Evidence that NONs Nasal Spray Zaps COVID-19

 **[Trial Site news](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/real-world-study-at-srinakharinwirot-university-bangkok-accumulating-evidence-that-nons-nasal-spray-zaps-covid-19-91a65004)** 

* "Srinakharinwirot University in Bangkok recently completed an investigation evaluating the efficacy of nitric oxide releasing nasal spray (NONS), finding that those participants in the NONS study arm once exposed to COVID-19 were 75% less likely to become infected when compared to the control group. "

* "The study’s lead author continued, “In previous randomized controlled, Phase III, clinical trials, NONS was also shown to be effective in rapidly reducing the duration of disease by 50% in participants who had already acquired COVID-19, suggesting it is a promising tool for both treatment and prevention.”

* "NONS is not yet approved for sale in Canada or USA. It is approved as a medical device under the brand name VirXTM in Thailand and as a medical device under the brand name of enovid™ in Indonesia, Israel, and Bahrain. "

* Some use also In India, Singapore and Nepal 0 but not the US or Canada (yet)

 **[Manufacturer](https://sanotize.com/)** 

* " The infection rate in participants who took NONS™ was 6.4% versus 25.6% in the control group (P<0.0001), representing a significant reduction in infection risk of 75%."
