The analytical sample included 5162 subjects who were stratified by cognitive status, i.e., dementia (n = 307), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 492), and normal cognitive status (NCS, n = 4363). Lifestyle variables were assessed and 25OHD was measured. The associations between lifestyle and 25OHD were calculated using linear models correcting for potential confounders.</p><p>Results</p><p>According to linear regression models, 25OHD was significantly lower in older people with dementia (53.8 ± 19.6 nmol/L) than in NCS participants (57.6 ± 17.7 nmol/L). Cod liver oil (7.1–9.2 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001) and dietary supplements (4.4–11.5 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001) were associated with higher 25OHD in all three groups. However, physical activity ≥ 3 h/week (2.82 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001), BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 (5.2 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001), non-smoking (4.8 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001), alcohol consumption (2.7 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001), and fatty fish consumption ≥ 3x/week (2.6 nmol/L, P &lt; 0.001) were related to higher 25OHD in NCS only, but not in participants with dementia or MCI.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Older people living in Iceland with dementia are at higher risk for 25OHD deficiency when compared to healthy individuals. Physical activity reported among participants with dementia, and MCI is low and is not significantly associated with 25OHD.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Lifestyle factors among NCS participants are associated with 25OHD levels. Importantly, healthy lifestyle should be promoted among individuals with MCI and dementia.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/iceland-dementia-april-2020.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>See in VitaminDWiki <a href=/posts/dementia-is-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-many-studies>Dementia is associated with low vitamin D - many studies</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=fewer-than-9-of-icelandic-icu-patients-had-more-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d---june-2016>Fewer than 9% of Icelandic ICU patients had more than 30 ng of Vitamin D - June 2016</h4><p><strong>Severe vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients at a high northern latitude</strong></p><p><a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.12748>https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.12748</a></p><p>R.

To our knowledge no studies have been conducted on vitamin D status amongst critically ill patients at high northern latitudes. Despite the Icelandic population traditionally taking vitamin D supplements, we hypothesized that the majority of critically ill patients in Reykjavik, Iceland have low vitamin D levels.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This was a prospective observational study on 122 patients admitted to Landspitali University Hospital intensive care unit. Serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured in all patients on two occasions (first and second day). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its effect on hospital stay was calculated.</p><p>Results</p><p><strong>Only 9% of patients had vitamin D levels recommended for good health (>75 nmol/l)</strong> and 69% were deficient (25(OH)D &lt; 50 nmol/l). The average difference between the first and second vitamin D samples was 2.8 nmol/l. Forty-three percent of the severely vitamin D deficient stayed in the ICU for more than 4 days compared to 19% of patients with better status (P = 0.196).</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is very common in critically ill patients at high northern latitudes and patients with severely deficient vitamin D levels had trend towards longer intensive care unit stay. Furthermore, 43% of the patients had vitamin D levels under 25 nmol/l that is associated with osteomalacia. It appears that a single vitamin D measurement gives a reasonable clue about the vitamin D status in critically ill patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/icelandic-critically-ill-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-homeostasis-amongst-adult-icelandic-population---2004-46-nmol-average>Vitamin-D homeostasis amongst adult Icelandic population - 2004 (46 nmol average)</h4><p>Laeknabladid. 90(1):29-36 <span>[Article in Icelandic]</span> PMID: 16819011</p><p>Oervar Gunnarsson 1 , Olafur Skúli Indriðason, Leifur Franzson, Edda Halldórsdóttir, Gunnar Sigurðsson</p><p>1 Division of endocrinology and metabolism, Iceland University Hospital, Fossvogi, 108 Reykjavík, Iceland. <a href=mailto:gunnars@landspitali.is>gunnars@landspitali.is</a>.</p><p>Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of vitamin D intake and production in skin on vitamin D homeostasis in adult Icelanders.</p><p>Methods: Participants were 30-85 years old, randomly selected from the registry of the Reykjavik area (64 degrees N) and answered a thorough questionnaire on diet and vitamin supplements. Concentrations of 25(OH)-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> in peripheral blood were examined based on season during the study period February 2001-January 2003, vitamin D intake and age (age groups 30-45, 50-65, and 70-85 years old). We defined vitamin D deficiency as either <span>[25(OH)D]</span> &lt;25 nmol/l or as <span>[25(OH)D]</span> where the inverse relationship between serum iPTH and <span>[25(OH)D]</span> became statistically significant.</p><p>Results: Of 2310 invited, 1630 subjects participated (70,6% participation) but 21 individuals were excluded due to primary hyperparathyroidism. Mean <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was <strong>46.5-/+20 nmol/l</strong> but varied by season, age and vitamin D intake, highest in June-July, 52.1-/+19.8 and lowest in February-March, 42.0-/+20.5 (p&lt;0.001). <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was highest in the oldest age group, 50.8-/+19.7, but lowest in the youngest, 42.5-/+20 as was the intake 16.6-/+10 microg/day compared to 9.9-/+9 microg/day in the youngest. The correlation between vitamin D intake and <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was highest for the oldest group, r=0.41, p&lt;0.001 but lowest in the youngest, r=0.24, p&lt;0.001. <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was significantly higher among users of vitamin supplements (45.4-/+19.7) or fish oil (53.0-/+18.4) than among non-users (38.0-/+18.9). Vitamin D insufficiency was seen among 14.5% of those participating according to traditional definition, but 50% were below <span>[25(OH)D]</span> of 45 nmol/l where negative correlation between <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and PTH became statistically significant.</p><p>Conclusions: The serum concentration of 25(OH)D at which vitamin D deficiency becomes biochemically significant is higher than traditionally thought. A daily intake of 15-20 microg/day during wintertime would be required to maintain normal homeostasis in Icelandic adults, which is considerably higher than present recommendations of 7-10 microg/day for adults. Further research is needed to define the limit for vitamin-D sufficiency.</p><hr><h4 id=48-nmol--vitamin-d-levels-of-children-in-iceland---2020>48 nmol = Vitamin D levels of Children in Iceland - 2020</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.laeknabladid.is/tolublod/2020/05/nr/7335>Vitamin D status of Icelandic children and youth: A long-term study</a></strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/d-iceland-children-in-english.jpg alt=image width=600><p><strong>Original in Icelandic</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/d-children-iceland.jpg alt=image width=600><hr><h4 id=only-13-of-icelandic-children-had-repeated-vitamin-d-tests--50-nmol-may-2020>Only 13% of Icelandic children had repeated Vitamin D tests > 50 nmol May 2020</h4><p><strong><span>[Vitamin D status of Icelandic children and youngsters: Longitudinal study]</span>.</strong></p><p>Gunnarsdottir B 1, Hrafnkelsson H 2, Johannsson E 3, Sigurðsson EL 4</p><p>Laeknabladid, 01 May 2020, 106(5):235-240Language:ice <a href=https://doi.org/10.17992/lbl.2020.05.579>https://doi.org/10.17992/lbl.2020.05.579</a></p><p>Vitamin D plays a key role for children&rsquo;s growth and physical development, not only by promoting bone health but also by its influence on extraskeletal systems. The Icelandic Directorate of Health recommends a vitamin D concentration in blood of at least 50 nmol/l. The object of this study was to evaluate the vitamin D status of Icelandic children and youngsters at four different ages, and furthermore to evaluate changes in vitamin D concentrations over time and connection to parathyroid hormone status (S-PTH).</p><p>Material and methods</p><p>The subjects were students from six elementary schools in Reykjavík, born in 1999. Blood tests were taken four times, in 2006, 2008, 2015 og 2017. Some of the subjects took part in all four tests, but more students joined in 2015 and 2017.</p><p>Results</p><p>In all the tests, around 60% of the subjects had lower vitamin D concentrations than recommended by The Icelandic Directorate of Health. Only 13% met the recommended criteria of a concentration over 50 nmol/l in repeated tests and 38.9% of the subjects had lower concentrations than recommended in at least two tests. There was no significant difference between sexes except that 17 year old girls had significantly higher Vitamin D concentrations than boys (p=0.04). S-PTH was negatively correlated to vitamin D concentrations at ages 7, 15 and 17 but there was not a significant correlation at age 9. S-PTH values were lowest at age 7 and then increased with age.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The majority of Icelandic children and youngsters have vitamin D concentrations under the values recommended by The Icelandic Directorate of Health. In many cases, the concentrations are repeatedly too low. It is clear that there is a need for increased vitamin D intake within this group if the goal regarding recommended concentrations is to be achieved. However, the influence of vitamin D deficiency on public health is not fully known.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/icelandic-children-may-2020.pdf>Download the Icelandic PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p>&ndash;</p><h4 id=vitamin-d-status-and-current-policies-to-achieve-adequate-vitamin-d-intake-in-the-nordic-countries>Vitamin D status and current policies to achieve adequate vitamin D intake in the Nordic countries</h4><p>Volume 49, Issue 6 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494819896878>https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494819896878</a></p><p>Suvi T.

The aim of this paper was to review the latest data on vitamin D status and intake and to describe the national supplementation and food fortification policies to achieve adequate vitamin D intake in the Nordic countries.</p><p>Methods: The data are based on results derived from a literature search presented in a workshop held in Helsinki in November 2018 and completed by recent studies.</p><p>Results: Vitamin D policies and the implementation of the recommendations differ among the Nordic countries. Vitamin D fortification policies can be mandatory or voluntary and widespread, moderate or non-existent. Vitamin D supplementation recommendations differ, ranging from all age groups being advised to take supplements to only infants. In the general adult population of the Nordic countries, vitamin D status and intake are better than in the risk groups that are not consuming vitamin D supplements or foods containing vitamin D. Non-Western immigrant populations in all Nordic countries share the problem of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency.</p><p>Conclusions: Despite the common nutrition recommendations, there are differences between the Nordic countries in the implementation of the recommendations and policies to achieve adequate vitamin D intake and status. There is a need for wider Nordic collaboration studies as well as strategies to improve vitamin D status, especially in risk groups.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nordic-2020-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=icelandic-mental-health-survey---jan-2023>Icelandic Mental Health Survey - Jan 2023</h4><p><strong>Mental health and sociodemographic characteristics among Icelanders, data from a cross-sectional study in Iceland</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/iceland-mental-health---2023-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p>&ldquo;Participants with the most considerable financial difficulties had the highest risk of high scores on</p><ul><li><p>depression RRR 11.19 (95% CI 5.8—21.57),</p></li><li><p>anxiety RRR 12.35 (95% CI 5.62—27.14) and</p></li><li><p>stress RRR 11.55 (95% CI 4.75—28.04) "</p></li></ul><p>&ldquo;We found that young Icelanders show more mental health problems than older Icelanders/&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-in-northern-latitudes-intake-and-status-in-icelandic-children---thesis----2018>Vitamin D in northern latitudes: Intake and status in Icelandic children - thesis - 2018</h4><p>Title: Vitamin D in northern latitudes: Intake and status in Icelandic children</p><p>Alternative Title: D-vítamín á norðlægum slóðum: Inntaka og búskapur íslenskra barna.</p><p>Author: Þórisdóttir, Birna University/Institute: Háskóli Íslands</p><p>University of Iceland, School: Heilbrigðisvísindasvið (HÍ), School of Health Sciences (UI)</p><p>Department: Matvæla- og næringarfræðideild (HÍ), Faculty of Food Science and Nutrition (UI)</p><p>URI: https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11815/919</p><p>Background: Adequate nutrition in childhood is essential for growth, development and health. Vitamin D supplement use is recommended in Iceland, starting in infancy. Little information exists on the vitamin D status of Icelandic infants and children. Vitamin D has been suggested to affect the development of sensitization to food allergens and food allergy. Aim: To study adherence to dietary guidelines among 6-year-old children (paper I), their vitamin D intake and vitamin D status at 12 months and 6 years (papers II and III) and compare vitamin D and feeding in infancy between 6-year-old children IgE-sensitized to food allergens and non-sensitized children (paper IV).</p><p>Methods: The study population is a nationally representative Icelandic cohort of infants born in 2005, followed up at 6 years of age. Three-day weighed food records were kept at 9 months (n=196), 12 months (n=170) and 6 years (n=162). Total vitamin D intake was calculated from both diet and supplements. Further infant nutrition data was collected by dietary history from birth to 5 months and by monthly 1-day food records at 5-8 and 10-11 months of age. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured at 12 months (n=76) and 6 years (n=139) and serum-specific IgE-antibodies against food at 6 years (n=144). Cut-off values for vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, sufficiency and possibly adversely high levels were set at 25(OH)D &lt;30 nmol/L, 30-50 nmol/L, >50 nmol/L and >125 nmol/L, respectively. The cut-off value for sensitization was set at specific IgE ≥0.35 kUA/L.</p><p>Results: Adherence to dietary guidelines varied among 6-year-old children but was poor in general. A quarter, or less, of the children followed the guidelines for fruit and vegetables, fish, wholegrain bread and other fiber-rich cereals and vitamin D supplements. The food intake was mirrored in a non-optimal distribution of macronutrients, fiber and salt intake. Vitamin and mineral density of the diet seemed however adequate, except for vitamin D. Supplements (fish liver oil or liquid infant drops during the first months) were the main sources of vitamin D. Total vitamin D intake was higher at 9-12 months than at 6 years (the median intakes were 8.7 μg/d vs. 4.9 μg/d, respectively, p&lt;0.01). The mean±SD concentration of 25(OH)D at 12 months was 98±32 nmol/L, with 92% of infants defined as having sufficient vitamin D status and none deficient. Vitamin D intake at 9-12 months, either from use of vitamin D supplements or consumption of fortified foods in significant amounts (e.g., 200 ml/d of formula), or both, was the main observed determinant for vitamin D status 12 months. Breastfeeding and season were not associated with vitamin D status at 12 months. Taking vitamin D supplements increased the risk of serum 25(OH)D at possibly adversely high levels, observed in a quarter of 12-month-old infants. At 6 years, vitamin D status was lower than in infancy (57±18 nmol/L), 30% of children were insufficient and 6% deficient. Higher total vitamin D intake at 6 years, blood samples collected in summer and higher serum 25(OH)D measured at 12 months, were associated with higher likelihood of vitamin D sufficiency at 6 years. The vitamin D status decreased during autumn in children not using vitamin D supplements. Fourteen 6-year-old children (10%) were sensitized to food allergens. Higher vitamin D intake at 12 months (OR=0.8, 95% CI=0.7-0.99) and vitamin D supplement use at 6 years (OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.98) were associated with lower risk of sensitization. Introduction of solid foods prior to four months was associated with increased risk of sensitization (OR=4.9, 95% CI=1.4-17). More weight gain and head circumference growth from 0-2 months and higher prevalence of overweight at 6 years was observed among sensitized than non-sensitized children.</p><p>Conclusions: The results indicate that a public health effort among Icelandic children is needed to increase adherence to dietary guidelines, including vitamin D supplement use. Healthy Icelandic infants and children receiving the recommended 10 µg/d vitamin D are likely to be vitamin D sufficient. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency may, however, be prevalent among 6-year-old children due to insufficient intake. Monitoring of diet and vitamin D status among Icelandic infants and children is important, looking both at low and high vitamin D levels. Further studies are needed on the associations of vitamin D and diet with food sensitization and allergy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/birna-thesis-final-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>Note: Thesis includes several of the author&rsquo;s publications</strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-levels-crash-in-icelandic-children-by-age-6---feb-2016>Vitamin D levels crash in Icelandic children by age 6 - Feb 2016</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Intake and Status in 6-Year-Old Icelandic Children Followed up from Infancy</strong></p><p>Nutrients 2016, 8(2), 75; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu8020075>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu8020075</a></p><p>by Birna Thorisdottir 1,*,Ingibjorg Gunnarsdottir 1,Laufey Steingrimsdottir 1,Gestur I.

Internationally, little is known about tracking vitamin D status from infancy to childhood. Following up 1-year-old infants in our national longitudinal cohort, our aims were to study vitamin D intake and status in healthy 6-year-old Icelandic children (n = 139) and to track vitamin D status from one year of age. At six years, the mean 25(OH)D level was 56.5 nmol/L (SD 17.9) and 64% of children were vitamin D sufficient (25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L). A logistic regression model adjusted for gender and breastfeeding showed that higher total vitamin D intake (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08–1.49), blood samples collected in summer (OR = 8.88, 95% CI = 1.83–43.23) or autumn (OR = 5.64, 95% CI = 1.16–27.32) compared to winter/spring, and 25(OH)D at age one (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.002–1.04) were independently associated with vitamin D sufficiency at age six. The correlation between 25(OH)D at age one and six was 0.34 (p = 0.003). Our findings suggest that vitamin D status in infancy, current vitamin D intake and season are predictors of vitamin D status in early school-age children. Our finding of vitamin D status tracking from infancy to childhood provides motivation for further studies on tracking and its clinical significance.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/6-year-old-icelandic-children.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=top-icelandic-disease-concerns-global-burden-of-disease---2010>Top Icelandic disease concerns (Global Burden of Disease) - 2010</h4><p><strong><a href=/posts/top-icelandic-disease-concerns-global-burden-of-disease-2010>Top Icelandic disease concerns - Global Burden of Disease 2010</a></strong></p><p><strong>Top 10 causes of death in Iceland</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/icelandic-deaths-top-10-2019.jpg alt=image width=200>

A random sample of 1286 adults was drawn from a national registry holding information about all citizens of Iceland. Data were collected with a postal-survey. Pain was evaluated with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), with instructions modified to evaluate pain in the past week as opposed to the past 24 h. Of 1286 invited, 599 (46.6%) participated, of which, 232 had experienced pain in the past week (40.3%). Participants had a mean (SD) age of 44.94 (17.12) years and 56% were women.

But the actual figures tell a very different story, and the method used to arrive at this conclusion is questionable to say the least. The actual reduction in deaths is negligible at best, and the most worrying result is how those fully vaccinated (two doses) were almost three times more likely to die from the disease than the unvaccinated.</p><p>In summary,</p><ul><li><p>only 20 lives were potentially saved in Iceland by Covid-19 vaccination,</p></li><li><p>while 60-70 may have been lost to the disease in the vaccinated.</p></li></ul><p>When we take into account the number of deaths reported following vaccination, the overall result of the experiment is likely to be negative.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/iceland-vax-costs-lives.pdf>Download the English PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/iceland-vax-costs-lives-icelandic-translation.pdf>Download the Icelandic translated PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=4-excess-deaths-in-iceland-for-ages-0-64-due-to-covid-vaccine---aug-2023>4% Excess deaths in Iceland for ages 0-64 (due to COVID vaccine) - Aug 2023</h4><p><strong><a href=/posts/excess-deaths-in-34-countries-probably-due-to-covid-vaccination-preprint>Excess deaths in 34 countries (probably due to COVID vaccination) – preprint Aug 2023</a></strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/excess-deaths-less-than-64.jpg alt=image width=600></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/alcohol.html><span class=tag>alcohol</span></a>
