#### [The Effects of Hormones in Dairy Milk on Cancer](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-effects-of-hormones-in-dairy-milk-on-cancer/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&utm_campaign=a21b587a5d-RSS_VIDEO_DAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-a21b587a5d-25209481&mc_cid=a21b587a5d&mc_eid=b95641625a) Dr. Michael Greger

 **Has video, transcript and references** 

* “Modern  **genetically improved**  dairy cows, such as the Holstein”—your standard black and white cow—can get reimpregnated after giving birth, and lactate throughout almost her entire next pregnancy, which means that “commercial cow’s milk” these days contains “large amounts of” pregnancy hormones, like “estrogens and progesterone.”

* ..."the estrogen levels in milk during the first eight months of a pregnant cow’s nine-month gestation: hormone levels shoot up more than 20-fold."

* ... easily 10 to 20 times less estrogen hormones than what you’d find in a birth control pill."

* ..."Harvard researchers followed tens of thousands of women—and their dairy consumption—for decades, and found a significantly higher risk of endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women who consumed more dairy."

   * 1.58 increased risk if drink 3 servings per day of all milk

   * most likely worse if happen to get milk from pregnant cows

   * Wonder if cows giving organic milk are  **genetically improved**

   * “A hundred thousand men and women followed for up to 20 years; what did they find? Milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer for each glass of milk.  **Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of death** . And they had significantly more bone and hip fractures too.”
