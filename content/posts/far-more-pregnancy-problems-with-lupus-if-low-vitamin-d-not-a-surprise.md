Objective: We evaluated the association of 25(OH) vitamin D levels with adverse pregnancy outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods: The Hopkins Lupus Cohort includes visits of pregnant patients, including assessment of 25(OH) vitamin D at each visit. We examined the relationship between 25(OH) vitamin D levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age). We also used a time-to-event analysis to assess whether time-varying of 25(OH) vitamin D levels were associated with time to miscarriage or preterm delivery.

Results: In subgroups of patients defined by the average of 25(OH) vitamin D levels, 

we observed significantly different risks of 

* miscarriage (p=0.0045), 

* preterm delivery (p=0.0007) 

and the composite measure of all three adverse pregnancy outcomes (p=0.011). 

The highest risks were observed among those with lowest or highest levels of vitamin D. 

* Nine out of 10 pregnancies with low vitamin D during the 2nd trimester resulted in a  **premature delivery** . 

The time-to-event model confirmed the same U-shaped association after adjustment for SLE disease activity, however, the increased risk among those with highest levels of vitamin D was not statistically significant. Body mass index did not appear to be a confounding factor.

Conclusion: Our study is not able to prove causation, but the results strongly suggest an association of 25(OH) vitamin D at both lower and higher levels with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We recommend monitoring of maternal serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels during SLE pregnancies, aiming for the ideal range of 40-59 ng/mL.
