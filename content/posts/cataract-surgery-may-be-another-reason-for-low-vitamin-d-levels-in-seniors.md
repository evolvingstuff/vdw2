I attended an outdoor barbecue at a senior residence in July 2013.

It was an excellent day: bright sun, a very slight breeze, about 75 degrees F

My 100 year-old father in-law stated that it was too bright after his cateract surgery (of 15 years ago)

&nbsp;

80% of the seniors stayed and ate indoors, and thus missed out on getting vitamin D

Suspect: Cataract surgery ==> too bright ==> stay out of the sun ==> get less vitamin D

The seniors could have used sunglasses, but did not.

 **Alternative explanation for seniors not going outdoors** 

Seniors greatly fear falling - and the outdoor location was unfamiliar - and could have something which might cause them to fall
