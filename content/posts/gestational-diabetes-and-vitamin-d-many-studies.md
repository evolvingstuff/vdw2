#### Gestational Diabetes: 30% increase in US since 2016 (reported July 2023)

 **[Gestational diabetes impacts nearly 75,000 pregnant individuals and their unborn babies each year in the United States, and according to the Centers for Disease Control cases have risen 30% since 2016.](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/osu-wexner-med-center-partners-lead-12m-study-targeting-rising-gestational-diabetes-aa37599d)** 

Which is probably similar to the increase of Diabetes in the same time period

#### Disrupted placental vitamin D metabolism and calcium signaling in gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia patients - April 2023

Introduction: Gestational diabetes (GDM) and pre-eclampsia (PE) represents the unrecognized risk factors for reduced bone content in neonates. The present study is planned to explore the components of vitamin D metabolism and calcium transport in placenta of GDM and PE cases and its effect on the neonatal bone mass determination using bone densitometry system.

Methods: We have collected serum and placenta tissues from GDM (n = 20), PE (n = 20), and healthy pregnancies (n = 20). In the present study, we found mRNA expression of oxidative stress markers, vitamin D metabolic components and calcium channels, calcium channel binding proteins, plasma membrane calcium ATPase, ATP synthase and Ca2+ release genes; Ryanodine receptors genes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in placental tissue of GDM, PE, and healthy pregnancies.

Results: We observed high level of oxidative stress in both GDM and PE placenta compared to normal pregnancies. 

* CYP2R1 and VDR mRNA expression was significantly downregulated and 

* upregulation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in GDM and PE compared with healthy cases. 

Similarly, calcium transporters were downregulated in GDM and PE placental tissues. In addition, CYP24A1, VDR, CaBP28K, TRPV5 and PMCA3 mRNA expression were correlated with BMC of neonates.

Discussion: Oxidative stress is probably relevant to disrupted vitamin D homeostasis and calcium transport in the placenta of GDM and PE cases. The altered regulatory mechanism of CYP24A1 and VDR could indicates more pronounced serum 25(OH)D reduction. Additionally, reduced BMC in the neonates of these cases might be as consequences of modified CYP24A1, VDR, CaBP28K, TRPV5 and PMCA3 mRNA expression.

#### >30 ng of Vitamin D in 2nd tri. associated with 39% less risk of Gestational Diabetes - April 2024

 **Maternal vitamin D status and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in twin pregnancies: a longitudinal twin pregnancies birth cohort study** 

Nutr J. 2024 Apr 10;23(1):41. [doi: 10.1186/s12937-024-00944-2.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12937-024-00944-2.)

Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy, with significant short-term and long-term implications for both mothers and their offspring. Previous studies have indicated the potential benefits of vitamin D in reducing the risk of GDM, yet little is known about this association in twin pregnancies. This study aimed to investigate maternal vitamin D status in the second trimester and examine its association with the risk of GDM in twin pregnancies.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study based on data from the Chongqing Longitudinal Twin Study (LoTiS). Peripheral blood serum was collected from the mothers in the second trimester to measure 25(OH)D concentrations. GDM was diagnosed at 23-26 weeks of gestation using a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine the correlations between vitamin D status and the risk of GDM.

Results: Of the total participants, 93 (29.9%) women were diagnosed with GDM. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration in the second trimester was 31.1 ± 11.2 ng/mL, and the rate of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were 23.5% and 18.7%, respectively. Compared to women with a 25(OH)D concentration < 30 ng/mL, those with a 25(OH)D concentration ≥ 30 ng/mL had a significantly lower risk of GDM ( **RR 0.61** ; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.86), especially those who were overweight before pregnancy (RR 0.32; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.64). The restricted cubic splines model showed an inverted J-shaped relationship between vitamin D concentrations and GDM risk.

Conclusions: The risk of GDM was significantly reduced in twin pregnant women with vitamin D concentrations ≥ 30 ng/mL in the second trimester.
