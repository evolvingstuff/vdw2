To explore the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide, especially the effect factors of asymptomatic infection and disappearance of clinical symptoms. A total of 66,448 COVID-19 patients in China who have been diagnosed by nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test were surveyed online (December 24, 2022 to January 16, 2023). Our cross-sectional study used descriptive analyses and binary Logistics regression model to assess the correlation between the clinical characteristics and relative factors, including age, gender, pre-existing conditions, reinfection, vaccination and treatment. A total of 64,515 valid questionnaires were collected. Among included participants, 5969 of which were asymptomatic. The symptoms were mainly upper respiratory symptoms, including dry and itchy throat (64.16%), sore throat (59.95%), hoarseness (57.90%), nasal congestion (53.39%). 

In binary Logistics regression model, we found that male, no pre-existing conditions, reinfection and vaccination have positive correlations with the appearance of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. In Cox proportional-hazards regression model, considering all clinical symptoms disappeared in 14 days as outcome, we found that ≤ 60 years old, male, no pre-existing conditions, vaccination and adopted treatment have positive correlations with rapid amelioration of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The clinical symptoms of the participants were mainly upper respiratory symptoms which were according with the infection of Omicron variant. Factors including age, gender, pre-existing conditions and reinfection could influence the clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, vaccination has positive significance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Lastly, the use of Chinese medicine maybe beneficial to COVID-19 patients, however, reasonable guidance is necessary.
