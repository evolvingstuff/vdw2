However, its potential</p><p>to examine how rapid cultural evolution to new lifestyles may have driven biological adaptation has not</p><p>been met, largely due to limited sample sizes. We assembled genome-wide data from 1,291 individuals</p><p>from Europe over 10,000 years, providing a dataset that is large enough to resolve the timing of selection</p><p>into the Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Historical periods. We identified 25 genetic loci with rapid changes</p><p>in frequency during these periods, a majority of which were previously undetected. Signals specific to the</p><p>Neolithic transition are associated with body weight, diet, and lipid metabolism-related phenotypes. They</p><p>also include immune phenotypes, most notably a locus that confers immunity to Salmonella infection at a</p><p>time when ancient Salmonella genomes have been shown to adapt to human hosts, thus providing a</p><p>possible example of human-pathogen co-evolution. In the Bronze Age, selection signals are enriched near</p><p>genes involved in pigmentation and immune-related traits, including at a key human protein interactor of</p><p>SARS-CoV-2. Only in the Historical period do the selection candidates we detect largely mirror</p><p>previously-reported signals, highlighting how the statistical power of previous studies was limited to the</p><p>last few millennia. The Historical period also has multiple signals associated with vitamin D binding,</p><p>providing evidence that lactase persistence may have been part of an oligogenic adaptation for efficient</p><p>calcium uptake and challenging the theory that its adaptive value lies only in facilitating caloric</p><p>supplementation during times of scarcity. Finally, we detect selection on complex traits in all three</p><p>periods, including selection favoring variants that reduce body weight in the Neolithic. In the Historical</p><p>period, we detect selection favoring variants that increase risk for cardiovascular disease plausibly</p><p>reflecting selection for a more active inflammatory response that would have been adaptive in the face of</p><p>increased infectious disease exposure. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for the high</p><p>prevalence of these deadly diseases in modern societies today and highlight the unique power of ancient</p><p>DNA in elucidating biological change that accompanied the profound cultural transformations of recent</p><p>human history.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/10-000-years-of-evolution---including-vitamin-d-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><div class=border style="background-color:#fffae2;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:700px"><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/map.jpg alt=image width=500><p>Gene modifications over 10,000 years of European history</p><p>Shows when various health problems started occuring after leaving hunter gatherer stage. etc</p><p>Health problems were a side effect of gene modifications</p><p><strong>The 2 Vitamin D changes happened about 3,000 years ago</strong></p></div><h4 id=change-in-dhcr7-and-vitamind-binding-protein>Change in DHCR7 and VitaminD Binding Protein</h4><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/table-1.jpg alt=image width=900><h4 id=clipped-from-pdf>Clipped from PDF</h4><h5 id=candidate-selective-signals-most-intense-during-the-transition-to-the-historical-period>Candidate selective signals most intense during the transition to the Historical Period</h5><p>The variant with the strongest significant deviation from expectation is in the LCT gene, which is</p><p>responsible for conferring the ability to digest lactose in adulthood in Europeans. This is also consistently</p><p>the strongest signal of natural selection detected in scans in modern Europeans, and in line with findings</p><p>in previous publications65, this allele appears to have experienced its major change in frequency primarily</p><p>in the past few thousand years, and not during the Bronze Age when the allele was first introduced in</p><p>central and western Europe.</p><p>We found a selective signal in <strong>DHCR7</strong> (the focal SNP that deviates most from expectation is in</p><p>an enhancer region several kb upstream of the gene), which governs availability of 7-dehydrocholesterol</p><p>for conversion to <strong>vitamin D3</strong> by the action of sunlight on the skin. Milk is rich in 7-dehydrocholesterol,</p><p>suggesting that selection on this locus as well as LCT might have been related to the need for increased</p><p>production of vitamin D66. This locus has also been linked to several auto-immune diseases. We also</p><p>detect evidence for deviation in allele frequency from expectation in the missense variant rs653178 in the</p><p>gene SH2B3. This allele doubled in frequency from the Bronze Age to the Historical period and is a major</p><p>risk locus for Celiac disease. The allele we identify as a signal of selection has recently also been shown</p><p>to be fine-mapped in a GWAS for vitamin D binding67. Functional investigation of the effect of the</p><p>SH2B3 genotype in response to lipopolysaccharide and muramyl dipeptide revealed that carriers of the</p><p>SH2B3 allele showed stronger activation of the NOD2 recognition pathway. This suggests that SH2B3</p><p>also plays a role in protection against bacterial infection68.</p><h5 id=increased-incidence-of-diseases-to-to-gene-changes>Increased incidence of diseases to to gene changes</h5><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/diseases.jpg alt=image width=670><p>Very difficult to understand this chart, even after reading the PDF</p><p>Fig. 4: Signals of polygenic selection. Traits shown in red in a given epoch are ones for which we find evidence for post-admixture selection favoring trait-increasing alleles during that epoch. Traits shown in blue show evidence for trait-decreasing in that epoch. In gray are non-significant results. The within-sib GWAS results are only available for a small subset of traits that overlap with BBJ and have a greatly reduced number of SNPs that are genome-wide significant in the GWAS (SNP counts shown in brackets where available). These rows with unavailability of GWAS results for traits from within-sib GWAS are left blank.</p><h5 id=portion-of-insight>Portion of insight</h5><p>One important set of insights relates to the genomic impact of the major transition from hunting</p><p>and gathering to farming. A set of alleles that were targets of selection in this period have to do with</p><p>decreased body weight/size. Complementarily, the archeological record also shows an overall decrease in</p><p>body size during the Neolithic transition 95. One hypothesis is that a reduction in overall calorie intake, a</p><p>trait that would be genetically correlated with reduced body weight, was advantageous in the Neolithic</p><p>when famines and resource instability became more frequent96. Similarly, selection for more efficient</p><p>storage and use of glucose in tissues during periods of famine or pathogen outbreaks might also underlie</p><p>several of our selection signals associated with insulin secretion, regulating glucose in the blood stream.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/celiac.html><span class=tag>celiac</span></a>
