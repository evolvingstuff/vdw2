BACKGROUND:

Few studies have prospectively examined the relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer risk in black men, a group at high risk for both low vitamin D status and prostate cancer.

METHODS:

Among black men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we identified 226 prostate cancer cases and 452 controls matched on age at randomization (±5 years), date of blood draw (±30 days), calendar year of cohort entry, and time since baseline prostate cancer screening (±1 year). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, and prostate cancer risk.

RESULTS:

Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with overall prostate cancer (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.40-1.33; P for trend = .25), although there were apparent inverse associations for nonaggressive disease (global P = .03, clinical stage I/II, and Gleason score <7) and among men ≥62 years old (P for interaction = .04) that were restricted to Q3. 

Interestingly, serum DBP was significantly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs Q1:  **OR, 0.45** ; 95% CI, 0.20-1.00; P for trend = .03), whereas the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio was not. Results were similar when we mutually adjusted for 25(OH)D and DBP, and we found no evidence of interaction between the two.

CONCLUSION:

Our study suggests higher (versus lower) circulating DBP may be independently associated with a decreased prostate cancer risk in black men independent of 25(OH)D status.
