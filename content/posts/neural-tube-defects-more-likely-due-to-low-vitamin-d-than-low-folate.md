#### NTD pregnacies were associated with low Vitamin D, none of NTD group had sufficient vitamin D - May 2016

 **Maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the occurrence of neural tube defects in Tunisia** 

Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2016 Aug;134(2):131-4. [doi: 10.1016/j.ijgo.2016.01.014.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgo.2016.01.014.) Epub 2016 May 4.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether low vitamin D levels in pregnant women are associated with the occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs) in Tunisia.

METHODS:

In a prospective study, pregnant women were recruited at a center in Tunis between January 1, 2012, and December 30, 2013. Women carrying a fetus with a severe NTD were recruited before elective termination. Matched, healthy pregnancy women were enrolled into a control group. Plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured by a competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay.

RESULTS:

Overall, 68 women formed the NTD group and 64 the control group. The mean maternal vitamin D level was significantly lower in the NTD group (20.65±10.25nmol/L) than in the control group (28.30±13.82nmol/L; P<0.001).  **Vitamin D deficiency was recorded for 53 (78%) women in the NTD group and 39 (61%) in the control group** . Vitamin D insufficiency was recorded for 15 (22%) women in the NTD group and 20 (31%) in the control group. Vitamin D sufficiency was found only in the control group (n=5 <span>[8%]</span>; P<0.001).

CONCLUSION: The findings confirm an association between a decreased vitamin D level in pregnant women and the risk of fetal NTDs.

#### Low Vitamin D or Low Calcium associated with NTD - 2016

 **Maternal serum vitamin D levels in pregnancies complicated by neural tube defects** 

J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2016;29(2):298-302. [doi: 10.3109/14767058.2014.999037.](https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2014.999037.) Epub 2014 Dec 29.

OBJECTIVE:

The association between vitamin D deficiency and abnormal neural development has been proposed previously. We aimed to evaluate maternal serum vitamin D levels in pregnancies complicated by neural tube defects (NTDs) and compared them with healthy pregnant women.

METHODS:

A total of 60 pregnant women were included in this controlled cross-sectional study. Thirty of the patients whose pregnancies were complicated by meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele, anencephaly and fetal acrania constituted the study group, whereas 30 normal pregnant women constituted the control group. The main parameters recorded for each woman were as follows: age, body mass index (BMI), gestational week (GW), gravidity, abortion, co-morbidities, dressing style, consumption of milk and dairy products and serum levels of 25(OH)VitD3, calcium, albumin and total protein.

RESULTS:

The mean maternal serum 25(OH)VitD3 level was  **6.2 ± 5.0 ng/ml in the study group and 9.1 ± 7.3 ng/ml in the control group (p: 0.071)**  The mean maternal serum calcium level was statistically significantly higher in the control group, and calcium-rich dietary intake was also more common in this group (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of age, BMI, GW, dressing style and serum levels of albumin and total protein.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D deficiency is common among pregnant women, and maternal serum calcium levels were lower in pregnancies complicated by NTD than healthy pregnant women. Larger further studies are required to evaluate the effects of calcium-rich dietary sources or vitamin D and calcium in the development of NTDs.
