#### Recent progress in nanotechnology-based drug carriers for resveratrol delivery

Resveratrol is a polyphenol with diverse pharmacological activities, but its clinical efficacy is limited due to low solubility/permeability, light-induced isomerization, auto-oxidation, and rapid metabolism. Nanodelivery systems, such as  **liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanocarriers, micelles, nanocrystals, inorganic nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, protein-based nanoparticles, exosomes, macrophages, and red blood cells (RBCs)**  have shown great potential for improving the solubility, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent advances in resveratrol nanoencapsulation and describes potential strategies to improve the pharmacokinetics of existing nanoformulations, enhance targeting, reduce toxicity, and increase drug release and encapsulation efficiency. The article also suggests that in order to avoid potential safety issues, resveratrol nanoformulations must be tested in vivo in a wide range of diseases.

#### Chat-GPT comparision of Trans and Liposomal forms - July 2023

* Liposomal resveratrol is a formulation that encapsulates resveratrol in liposomes - small spherical vesicles made from phospholipids. This formulation is aimed at improving the bioavailability of resveratrol, meaning that it may be better absorbed and stay in the bloodstream for a longer period of time compared to non-encapsulated resveratrol.

* Here is a comparison between liposomal resveratrol and trans-resveratrol:

* Bioavailability: Liposomal resveratrol is thought to have higher bioavailability compared to regular trans-resveratrol. The liposomal encapsulation is intended to protect resveratrol from degradation in the digestive system and facilitate its absorption into the bloodstream.

* Effectiveness: Due to the increased bioavailability, liposomal resveratrol may be more effective at delivering the potential health benefits of resveratrol.

* Cost: Liposomal formulations are generally more expensive to produce, so liposomal resveratrol supplements may be more expensive compared to regular trans-resveratrol supplements.

* Research and Evidence: As of 2021, there is a considerable amount of research on trans-resveratrol, but limited research on liposomal resveratrol. It’s important to note that while the liposomal form might offer better bioavailability, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety.

* Administration and Dosage: Liposomal resveratrol is usually available in liquid form, which might be easier for some people to take compared to capsules or tablets of trans-resveratrol.

Resveratrol is a polyphenol with diverse pharmacological activities, but its clinical efficacy is limited due to low solubility/permeability, light-induced isomerization, auto-oxidation, and rapid metabolism. Nanodelivery systems, such as __liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, lipid nanocarriers, micelles, nanocrystals, inorganic nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, protein-based nanoparticles, exosomes, macrophages, and red blood cells (RBCs)__ have shown great potential for improving the solubility, biocompatibility, and therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent advances in resveratrol nanoencapsulation and describes potential strategies to improve the pharmacokinetics of existing nanoformulations, enhance targeting, reduce toxicity, and increase drug release and encapsulation efficiency. The article also suggests that in order to avoid potential safety issues, resveratrol nanoformulations must be tested in vivo in a wide range of diseases.

!!!!Chat-GPT comparision of Trans and Liposomal forms - July 2023
*Liposomal resveratrol is a formulation that encapsulates resveratrol in liposomes - small spherical vesicles made from phospholipids. This formulation is aimed at improving the bioavailability of resveratrol, meaning that it may be better absorbed and stay in the bloodstream for a longer period of time compared to non-encapsulated resveratrol.
*Here is a comparison between liposomal resveratrol and trans-resveratrol:
*Bioavailability: Liposomal resveratrol is thought to have higher bioavailability compared to regular trans-resveratrol. The liposomal encapsulation is intended to protect resveratrol from degradation in the digestive system and facilitate its absorption into the bloodstream.
*Effectiveness: Due to the increased bioavailability, liposomal resveratrol may be more effective at delivering the potential health benefits of resveratrol.
*Cost: Liposomal formulations are generally more expensive to produce, so liposomal resveratrol supplements may be more expensive compared to regular trans-resveratrol supplements.
*Research and Evidence: As of 2021, there is a considerable amount of research on trans-resveratrol, but limited research on liposomal resveratrol. It’s important to note that while the liposomal form might offer better bioavailability, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety.
*Administration and Dosage: Liposomal resveratrol is usually available in liquid form, which might be easier for some people to take compared to capsules or tablets of trans-resveratrol.
