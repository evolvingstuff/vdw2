Note 3: It should be noted that the intake of vitamin D via food would add to synthesis caused by exposure to sunlight.

Depending on the amount of sunlight the risk of adverse effects at an intake at the upper level would increase. It

should also be noted that  **higher doses of vitamin D might be needed, particular in elderly,**  to achieve optimal

serum levels of 25(OH)D for purpose of optimal mineralisation of the skeleton. Such treatment should be under

medical surveillance.
