* This trial analyzed the reduction from day one of supplementation

* It is obvious from their graphs that there was no benefit until months later

* Previous studies have found that 2-6 months are needed to restore vitamin D levels

 **Notes on increased benefits** 

* 14,000 IU will provide a much bigger benefit to the children who weigh less – but body weight was ignored by this study

* A much bigger benefit will result from gut-friendly Vitamin D (more bio-available)

* A loading dose of vitamin D will start the benefits in 4 days instead of 4 months
