# Started Dec 8, 2010

# Phase 1: Have people quickly experience the benefits of vitamin D

* in less than 1 month 

* at very low cost

* virtually no risk

# Phase 2: Have people make vitamin D a habit

* Feel much better all of the time

* Greatly reduce the probability of getting many diseases

# Protocols when vitamin D deficiency is suspected

## Standard protocol for US Doctors; vitamin D2

   * Note: Most doctors have less than 10 hours of vitamin D learning

* Test levels

* Prescribe 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 once a week for 8 weeks

   * Note: Most researchers agree that vitamin D2 is only about 1/3 as effective as vitamin D3

   * Vitamin D2 may have more adverse reactions than vitamin D3

## VitaminDWiki vitamin D3

   * Note: VitaminDWiki provides access to 1,000's of hours of vitamin D information to people and doctors

   * Note: Hope to have many vitamin D experts agree with the VitaminDWiki protocol

* Test levels only if suspect highly deficient 

   * The cost and effort of testing are large barriers to people improving their health

* First test for possible vitamin D allergic reaction by taking 5,000 IU and waiting for 3 days

   * Approx 1 in 300 people have an adverse reaction to any amount of vitamin D3

   * The standard US protocol appears to ignore the possibility of allergic reaction or drug interactions, and starts with 50,000 IU dose

* Co-factors for vitamin D3 are recommended to virtually eliminate the problems some people have with large amounts of vitamin D

   * Note: the standard medical protocol does not appear to consider co-factors (Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin K2, etc)

   * Having the co-factors virtually eliminates the small occurrance of adverse reactions

      * i.e. excess Calcium being deposited in arteries, kidney stones, etc.

# Outline of Phase 1

* Person determines their possible vitamin D deficiency <a href="/posts/click-here-for-current-version" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 889">CLICK HERE for current version</a>

* If deficient, the person checks the VitaminDWiki for possible drug interactions and contra-indications

* Buy $5 bottle of 5,000 IU capsules of vitamin D

* Take a single 5,000 IU capsule and wait for 3 days - looking for possible allergic reactions (to be described)

   * Approx 1 in 300 people have an adverse reaction to any amount of vitamin D3 - especially if co-factors are imbalanced

* Take a single dose of about 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 and experience the benefits in 5-30 days

   * Will provide a summary of why a single dose of 50,000 is not a risk, with links to many references
