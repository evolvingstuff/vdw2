* "Before the pandemic, about 36 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds were considered overweight or obese; during the pandemic, that increased to 45.7 percen"

* "In some Latin American countries, governments have instituted stricter food labeling laws, pushing back against sugary beverages and ultra-processed foods in an effort to escape the obesity epidemic that has overtaken the United States." 

* :In Chile, for instance, **foods high in added sugar, saturated fats, calories and added sodium must display black stop signs**  on the front of their packages. Nothing with black stop signs can be sold or promoted in schools or included in child-targeted television ads."
