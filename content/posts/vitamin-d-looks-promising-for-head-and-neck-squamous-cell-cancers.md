### Immune regulatory activity of vitamin d3 in head and neck cancer.

Cancers (Basel). 2013 Aug 14;5(3):1072-85. [doi: 10.3390/cancers5031072.](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers5031072.)

Young MR, Day TA.

While vitamin D exhibits a multitude of cellular effects that can impact on cancer development and progression, this review focuses on its immune modulatory effects. These immune modulatory effects can be both direct and indirect. Compared to other cancer types, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have received less attention, but are a fascination immunologically because of the profound extent to which they inhibit immune defenses. This review describes the mechanisms of some of these immune inhibitory processes and how vitamin D can help overcome aspects of this immune suppression.
