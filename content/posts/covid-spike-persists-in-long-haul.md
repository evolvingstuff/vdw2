#### Boston Study Finds SARS-CoV-2 Spike Persists with Long COVID

 **[TrialSiteNews](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/boston-study-finds-sars-cov-2-spike-persists-with-long-covid-2f9cd77d)** 

* "When measuring the biomarkers, the team identified a spike in about 60% of long COVID patients; however, they didn’t detect a spike in the COVID-19 patients"

##### Spike still in blood for many many months

##### Not just in blood

* :The authors back this study with another reporting that “SARS-CoV-2 RNA” was found in “multiple anatomic sites up to seven months after symptom onset.” The authors report, “Post-mortem tissue analysis revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral specific protein expression not only in respiratory tissues, but also in cardiovascular, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, peripheral nervous, and brain tissues in the majority of individuals analyzed” in this other study."
