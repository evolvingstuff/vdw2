As a notable contributor to environmental pollution, MPs have gained significant attention owing to their wide application and potential toxicity. MPs have been reported to accumulate in mammalian reproductive organs, adversely affecting male sperm quality, and pose a serious threat to male fertility. Therefore, it is important to understand how MPs exposure impacts sperm and the male reproductive system.</p><p>This manuscript reviews the research progress of MPs exposure on sperm toxicity from three aspects:</p><ul><li><p>the effect of MPs on spermatogenesis and sperm quality,</p></li><li><p>the ‘Trojan horse effect’ and</p></li><li><p>cross-generational effect of MPs.</p></li></ul><p>The findings indicated a significant correlation between MPs exposure and reduced sperm quality reduction as well as abnormal spermatogenesis.

This manuscript also reviews current treatment approaches for MPs exposure, providing a valuable theoretical foundation for future scientific research and clinical interventions. In summary, this review emphasizes that MPs can impair male reproductive health through mechanisms such as inflammatory responses, hormonal disruption, and sperm toxicity. By consolidating current evidence, this work lays a foundation for future research to further investigate the molecular pathways and long-term effects of MPs on male fertility.</p><hr><h5 id=microplastics-increase-miscarriage-in-humans-and-mice---march-2024>Microplastics increase miscarriage in humans (and mice) - March 2024</h5><p><strong>Exposure to high dose of polystyrene nanoplastics causes trophoblast cell apoptosis and induces miscarriage</strong></p><p>Particle and Fibre Toxicology <a href=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12989-024-00574-w>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12989-024-00574-w</a></p><p>Shukun Wan, Xiaoqing Wang, Weina Chen, Manli Wang, Jingsong Zhao, Zhongyan Xu, Rong Wang, Chenyang Mi, Zhaodian Zheng & Huidong Zhang</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/nanoplastics-miscarriage-chart.webp alt=image width=400>
<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/nanoplastics-miscarriage.webp alt=image width=700><p>Background</p><p>With rapid increase in the global use of various plastics, microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) pollution and their adverse health effects have attracted global attention. MPs have been detected out in human body and both MPs and NPs showed female reproductive toxicological effects in animal models. Miscarriage (abnormal early embryo loss), accounting for 15-25% pregnant women worldwide, greatly harms human reproduction. However, the adverse effects of NPs on miscarriage have never been explored.</p><p>Results</p><p>In this study, we identified that polystyrene (PS) plastics particles were present in women villous tissues. Their levels were higher in villous tissues of unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients vs. healthy control (HC) group. Furthermore, mouse assays further confirmed that exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, 50 nm in diameter, 50 or 100 mg/kg) indeed induced miscarriage. In mechanism, PS-NPs exposure (50, 100, 150, or 200 µg/mL) increased oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased apoptosis in human trophoblast cells by activating Bcl-2/Cleaved-caspase-2/Cleaved-caspase-3 signaling through mitochondrial pathway. The alteration in this signaling was consistent in placental tissues of PS-NPs-exposed mouse model and in villous tissues of unexplained RM patients. Supplement with Bcl-2 could efficiently suppress apoptosis in PS-NPs-exposed trophoblast cells and reduce apoptosis and alleviate miscarriage in PS-NPs-exposed pregnant mouse model.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Exposure to PS-NPs activated Bcl-2/Cleaved-caspase-2/Cleaved-caspase-3, leading to excessive apoptosis in human trophoblast cells and in mice placental tissues, further inducing miscarriage.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nanoplastics-miscarriage-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h6 id=40-increase-in-recent-summer-miscarriage-rates-in-the-us---perplexity-ai-july-2024httpswwwperplexityaisearchhas-there-been-a-recent-increa-u3dsryqmqbereveldjm2kw>40% increase in recent summer miscarriage rates in the US - <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/has-there-been-a-recent-increa-u3DSRYqmQBereVELdJm2Kw>Perplexity AI July 2024</a></h6><p><strong>Suspected to be due to increased temperatures</strong></p><p>**Wonder if it is due to staying away from the hot sun and thus getting less vitamin D_</p><hr><h5 id=exposure-to-microplastics-and-human-reproductive-outcomes-a-systematic-review---jan-2024>Exposure to microplastics and human reproductive outcomes: A systematic review - Jan 2024</h5><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mp-exposure---in-human-tissue.webp alt=image width=600>

Everyday items like food containers, water bottles, clothing, and cosmetics can increase people’s resistance to antibiotics. Microplastics in the environment serve as a suitable substrate for the production of “antibiotic-resistant genes” (ARGs). These genes are protected by bacterial chromosomes, phages, and plasmids, which are biological vectors capable of spreading and transferring antibiotic-resistance to humans, thereby reducing their ability to fight infections. In this study, we reviewed several articles that evaluated the abundance of ARGs and the changes in their expression in different environments. These changes were observed upon exposure to antibiotics such as tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, and others, as well as microplastics, nanoplastics, or a combination of both. To assess the impact of these stressors on ARG abundance, we compiled data from various studies using heatmaps and tables of ARG abundances in tissues or various environments. By synthesizing this information, we aimed to identify which ARGs were upregulated or downregulated in response to each stressor. Our findings provide insights into the potential risks posed by environmental pollutants and underscore the importance of understanding the dynamics of ARGs in response to different stressors.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/arg-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h5 id=microplastics-and-human-health-unveiling-the-gut-microbiome-disruption-and-chronic-disease-risks---dec-2024>Microplastics and Human Health: Unveiling the Gut Microbiome Disruption and Chronic Disease Risks - Dec 2024</h5><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mp-sources-dec-2024.webp alt=image width=900><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-and-human-health-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=plastic-takeaway-food-containers-may-cause-human-intestinal-damage-200000-particles-per-cm2-when-heated--june-2024>Plastic takeaway food containers may cause human intestinal damage (200,000 particles per cm2 when heated) – June 2024</h4><p>Journal of Hazardous Materials <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134866>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134866</a> PDF behind paywall</p><p>Tianyue Jin a, Yaxuan Liu a, Honghong Lyu b, Yuhe He c, Hongwen Sun a, Jingchun Tang a, Baoshan Xing d</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/microplastics-in-takeaways.webp alt=image width=750><p>The microplastics and organic additives formed in the routine use of plastic takeaway food containers may pose significant health risks.

Complementary methods for the robust detection of tissue MNPs, including pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, confirm the presence of MNPs in human kidney, liver and brain. MNPs in these organs primarily consist of polyethylene, with lesser but significant concentrations of other polymers. Brain tissues harbor higher proportions of polyethylene compared to the composition of the plastics in liver or kidney, and electron microscopy verified the nature of the isolated brain MNPs, which present largely as nanoscale shard-like fragments. Plastic concentrations in these decedent tissues were not influenced by age, sex, race/ethnicity or cause of death; the time of death (2016 versus 2024) was a significant factor, with increasing MNP concentrations over time in both liver and brain samples (P = 0.01). Finally, even greater accumulation of MNPs was observed in a cohort of decedent brains with documented dementia diagnosis, with notable deposition in cerebrovascular walls and immune cells. These results highlight a critical need to better understand the routes of exposure, uptake and clearance pathways and potential health consequences of plastics in human tissues, particularly in the brain.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-dementia-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a><strong>{FONT}</strong> The study was reported in many places.

However, a complete understanding of how inhaled MPs distribute within the human respiratory tract (HRT) remains insufficient. This study developed a physiologically-based kinetic HRT model to evaluate the deposition and clearance of MPs over time and at varying concentrations based on their aerodynamic diameter (AD). We quantified the contributions of AD-specific MPs to inhalation exposure trends using literature-based atmospheric MP pollution data from 2015 to 2022. Exposure assessments were conducted in data-rich settings, including megacities, urban-rural, and age-specific populations. Our analysis revealed that all suspended MPs had ADs less than 70 μm, with fragments, fibers, and spheres in decreasing order of prevalence.** Modeling results demonstrated a pronounced variation (∼10**10 magnitudes) in internal MP burdens **across airway regions during long-term exposure. On average, inhaled MPs larger than 40 μm accumulated exclusively in extrathoracic and bronchi regions, whereas MPs with ADs of 0.1–5 μm were the primary contributors to internal burdens. We identified nasal airflow rate as the most sensitive factor influencing internal burdens of MPs larger than 1 μm.</p><p>Furthermore, our findings showed that** infants, children, and the elderly were more vulnerable to short-term exposure, whereas adolescents and adults were of greater concern with long-term exposure. **These insights provide valuable guidance for policy decisions on targeting interventions to at-risk regions or susceptible populations.</p><hr><h4 id=great-summary-article-about-microplastics-the-environment-and-human-health---feb-2025-plastic-on-the-mind-assessing-the-risks-from-micro--and-nanoplasticshttpshackadaycom20250212plastic-on-the-mind-assessing-the-risks-from-micro-and-nanoplastics-img-srchttpsd1bk1kqxc0symcloudfrontnetattachmentswebppain-sourceswebp-altimage-width800>Great summary article about microplastics, the environment, and human health - Feb 2025** <a href=https://hackaday.com/2025/02/12/plastic-on-the-mind-assessing-the-risks-from-micro-and-nanoplastics/>Plastic On The Mind: Assessing The Risks From Micro- And Nanoplastics</a> **<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/pain-sources.webp alt=image width=800></h4><hr><h4 id=microplastics-from-soil-and-groundwater-to-human-body-also-lists-household-plastics---feb-2025>Microplastics from Soil and Groundwater to Human Body (also lists household plastics) - Feb 2025</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/types-abd-sources-of-plastics.webp alt=image width=500><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-from-soil-and-groundwater-to-humans-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=10-shocking-hidden-sources-of-microplastics-in-your-kitchen---feb-2025-youtube-15-minutehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvypowpldpwzk--summarized-by-glasp-ai--0000-0052-microplastics-are-tiny-plastic-particles-smaller-than-seeds-that-break-down-from-larger-plastic-items-and-have-become-both-an-environmental-and-human-health-concern>10 SHOCKING Hidden Sources of Microplastics In Your Kitchen - Feb 2025** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPOwPlDpwzk">YouTube 15 minute</a> summarized by GLASP AI *** (00:00-00:52) Microplastics are tiny plastic particles smaller than seeds that break down from larger plastic items, and have become both an environmental and human health concern.</h4><ul><li><p>(01:24) A review of over 3,000 studies linked microplastics to lung and colon cancer, lung diseases, and infertility.</p></li><li><p>(02:18-02:50) Regular coffee filters often contain plastic unless specifically labeled as &ldquo;paper filters.&rdquo; The speaker recommends using brown, unbleached paper filters like Melitta natural brown filters.</p></li><li><p>(03:17-04:20) Dishwasher and laundry pods contain polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a plastic that dissolves but remains present in water.

While completely avoiding them is challenging, there are several practical steps you can take to minimize your exposure:** Water ***** Use a Water Filter: **Invest in a high-quality water filter that can remove microplastics. Look for filters with a fine mesh or activated carbon.</p><p>*** Avoid Bottled Water: <strong>Bottled water often contains microplastics. Opt for filtered tap water instead.</strong> Air ***** Ventilation: **Ensure good ventilation in your home to reduce indoor air pollution.</p><p>*** Air Purifiers: **Use air purifiers with HEPA filters to capture microplastic particles.</p><p>*** Avoid Synthetic Fabrics: <strong>Reduce the use of synthetic textiles like polyester, which shed microfibers into the air. Choose natural fibers like cotton or wool instead.</strong> Food ***** Avoid Processed and Packaged Foods: **Processed and packaged foods often contain microplastics. Choose fresh, whole foods whenever possible.</p><p>*** Reduce Seafood Consumption: **Seafood, especially shellfish, can contain high levels of microplastics.

The effects of microplastic exposure on public health have gained increased attention as it is known to cause a range of neurotoxic changes, some of which are similar to the pathological features of PD. We carried out low-dose microplastic exposure experiments on mice and Caenorhabditis elegans models and implemented a survey regarding the utilization of plastic products in the population. We found that low-dose microplastic exposure accelerated dopamine neuron degeneration and the onset of movement disorders in vivo, inducing a PD-like neuronal pathology through its effects on the intestinal mucosal barrier, immune barrier, and microbial barrier. Notably, non-penetrating microplastics facilitated neuroinflammation by triggering excessive reactive oxygen species production and a sustained UPRmt. Furthermore, our population survey demonstrated that inappropriate use was a major source of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract. The high use of disposable plastic tableware, especially in those with definite microplastic exposure, was also associated with intestinal inflammatory symptoms. As a novel pollutant, microplastic exposure in vivo undoubtedly executes an important role in the degeneration of dopamine neurons, regardless of barrier penetration, which is a non-independent risk factor that cannot be ignored in the athogenesis of PD.&rdquo;</p><p>Study mentioned age-adjusted PD incidence increased by 115% in 30 years (from 1990)</p><p>The sample of the PDF showed that the study looked at increased fecal microplastics, but did not indicate the amount of increase.</p><hr><h6 id=microplastics-might-be-a-cause-of-parkinsons---nov-2023-nanoplastics-linked-to-changes-in-brain-proteins-associated-with-parkinsons-study-findshttpswwwsciencealertcomnanoplastics-linked-to-changes-in-brain-proteins-associated-with-parkinsons-study-findsutm_sourcesubstackutm_mediumemail-science-alert--reporting-on--anionic-nanoplastic-contaminants-promote-parkinsons-diseaseassociated-α-synuclein-aggregationhttpswwwscienceorgdoi101126sciadvadi8716-science-advances-free-pdf---->Microplastics might be a cause of Parkinson&rsquo;s - Nov 2023** <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nanoplastics-linked-to-changes-in-brain-proteins-associated-with-parkinsons-study-finds?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Nanoplastics Linked to Changes in Brain Proteins Associated With Parkinson&rsquo;s, Study Finds</a> Science Alert **** Reporting on **** <a href=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi8716>Anionic nanoplastic contaminants promote Parkinson’s disease–associated α-synuclein aggregation</a> Science Advances, FREE PDF **&mdash;</h6><h4 id=fate-of-microplastics-in-wastewater-treatment-plants---book-nov-2024-occurrence-identification-potential-factors-and-future-perspectives-crc-37-to-rent-for-6-monthshttpsdoiorg1012019781003438793>Fate of Microplastics in Wastewater Treatment Plants - book Nov 2024** Occurrence, Identification, Potential Factors, and Future Perspectives **CRC <a href=https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003438793>$37 to rent for 6 months</a></h4><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fate-of-microplastics-compresspdf.pdf>Preview PDF with Table of Contents of 14 chapters </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=polystyrene-microplastics-found-in-prostate-cancers-but-not-elsewhere-in-prostate-small-study---oct-2024-medicalnewsnethttpswwwnews-medicalnetnews20241001high-levels-of-microplastics-found-in-prostate-tumors-possibly-linked-to-take-out-foodaspx-reporting-on-identification-and-analysis-of-microplastics-in-para-tumor-and-tumor-of-human-prostatehttpswwwthelancetcomjournalsebiomarticlepiis2352-39642400396-7fulltext20-free-pdf>Polystyrene microplastics found in Prostate cancers, but not elsewhere in Prostate (small study) - Oct 2024** <a href=https://www.news-medical.net/news/20241001/High-levels-of-microplastics-found-in-prostate-tumors-possibly-linked-to-take-out-food.aspx>MedicalNewsNet</a> **Reporting on <a href=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(24)00396-7/fulltext%20>Identification and analysis of microplastics in para-tumor and tumor of human prostate</a> FREE PDF</h4><hr><h4 id=microplastics-in-the-olfactory-bulb-of-the-brain-in-8-out-of-15-people---sept-2024-microplastics-in-the-olfactory-bulb-of-the-human-brain-jama-netw-open-202479e2440018-free-pdfdoi101001jamanetworkopen202440018>Microplastics in the Olfactory Bulb of the brain in 8 out of 15 people - Sept 2024** Microplastics in the Olfactory Bulb of the Human Brain **JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(9):e2440018. <a href=doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.40018>FREE PDF</a></h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/ob.webp alt=image width=400><p>image is from the web, not the study</p><hr><h4 id=microplastics-in-ecological-system-their-prevalence-health-effects-and-remediation---sept-2024>Microplastics in ecological system: Their prevalence, health effects, and remediation - Sept 2024</h4><p>Environmental Nanotechnology, Monitoring & Management - Sept 2024, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2024.101007>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2024.101007</a>** Note: Appears to focus on microplastics, and ignores nanoplastics, a much bigger problem <strong><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mp-sept-2024.webp alt=image width=800></strong> Zoomed in view of above chart **<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/microplastic-problems.webp alt=image width=700></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/r-methods.webp alt=image width=550><p>Water is a fundamental component of human physiological processes, playing a crucial role in functions such as nutrient assimilation and metabolic activities. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in guaranteeing a plentiful food supply for all organisms. In addition to its duty in providing nutrition, water serves as a home for many life forms and plays a vital part in establishing a conducive living environment. However, the introduction of plastic materials has led to the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments, which has become a global issue that has attracted significant interest from both the scientific community and the general public. The increasing worldwide demand for plastics can be ascribed to its multifunctionality in commercial and industrial contexts, combined with its cost-effectiveness. Members of Parliament have been identified through multiple sources, including but not limited to cosmetic products, industrial wastes, and fishing operations. The primary aim of this research is to conduct a thorough examination of the consequences resulting from the widespread presence of MPs on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as the impact on human welfare. Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient mitigation measures in order to remove MPs from water reservoirs, protect ecological integrity, and provide a safer environment for future generations. Furthermore, this work evaluates the benefits and limitations of utilized methodologies, elucidating the inherent difficulties in MPs research that require resolution in order to achieve a thorough comprehension of these particles. International collaboration plays a crucial role in efficiently resolving concerns related to marine pollutants, as they have the ability to disperse by wind and sea currents, leading to possible repercussions that are difficult to predict.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastic-remediation-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=what-microplastics-are-doing-to-the-brain-body-and-reproductive-systems---dr-patrick-sept-2024-youtube-74-minuteshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhtzw_grlzjwab_channelfoundmyfitness-img-srchttpsd1bk1kqxc0symcloudfrontnetattachmentswebpmicroplastics-bodywebp-altimage-width800>What Microplastics Are Doing to the Brain, Body, and Reproductive Systems - Dr. Patrick Sept 2024** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTzw_grLzjw&amp;ab_channel=FoundMyFitness">YouTube 74 minutes</a> **<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/microplastics-body.webp alt=image width=800></h4><p>(00:03:59) Why exclusively drinking bottled water could increase your microplastic intake by up to 90,000 particles per year</p><p>(00:07:07) Why consuming food or drinks heated in plastic increases BPA exposure up to 55x</p><p>(00:08:07) How microwaving food in plastic containers can release over 4 million microplastic particles into a meal in just 3 minutes</p><p>(00:08:18) Why microwavable popcorn is a major source of PFAS (AKA, forever chemicals)</p><p>(00:21:15) How consuming canned soup daily for 5 days affects urinary BPA levels</p><p>(00:26:38) The likely link between BPA & autism spectrum disorder</p><p>(00:33:46) Why the brain may bioaccumulate plastic at 10-20x the rate of other organs</p><p>(00:34:17) The strong correlation between brain microplastic levels & neurodegenerative disease</p><p>(00:34:50) Why the growing amount of microplastic in human brains (50% more from 2016 to 2024) is cause for concern</p><p>(00:43:56) How drinking from an aluminum can lined with BPA can increase blood pressure in just a few hours</p><p>(00:50:31) Why you should never drink Topo Chico sparkling water</p><p>(00:53:02) The only water filtration method that removes up to 99% of microplastic particles</p><p>(00:57:14) Why disposable coffee cups are a major source of BPA exposure</p><p>(00:58:14) How salt adds 7,000 microplastic particles to your diet every year</p><p>(00:59:18) How to reduce microplastics in indoor air</p><p>(01:00:52) How to alter your wardrobe to reduce microplastic exposure</p><p>(01:02:32) Why handling receipts is a major source of BPA exposure — especially after using hand sanitizer</p><p>(01:06:28) Why sulforaphane could increase BPA, BPS, & phthalate excretion</p><p>(01:10:15) Are microplastic-associated chemicals excreted through sweat?</p><p><a href=https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/microplastics>Excellent detailed show notes includes many charts</a>   {FONT(size=&ldquo;14&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-show-notes-and-charts-compresspdf.pdf>PDF </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=a-sea-fugus-has-learned-how-to-slowly-eat-polyethylene-that-has-been-exposed-to-uv-at-the-surface---july-2024-biodegradation-of-polyethylene-by-the-marine-fungus-parengyodontium-album-portions-of-the-study-are-available-onlinehttpsdoiorg101016jscitotenv2024172819>A sea fugus has learned how to slowly eat polyethylene that has been exposed to UV (at the surface) - July 2024** Biodegradation of polyethylene by the marine fungus Parengyodontium album **<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172819>portions of the study are available online</a></h4><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeaQA0GQqrI">YouTube video describes the study and mentions land-based microbes consuming plastic as well</a></p><hr><h4 id=microplastics-found-in-8-human-organ-systems---scoping-review-aug-2024-detection-of-microplastics-in-human-tissues-and-organs-a-scoping-review-j-glob-health-2024-aug-231404179-doi-107189jogh1404179httpsdoiorg107189jogh1404179>Microplastics found in 8 human organ systems - scoping review Aug 2024** Detection of microplastics in human tissues and organs: A scoping review **J Glob Health 2024 Aug 23:14:04179. <a href=https://doi.org/%5B10.7189/jogh.14.04179%5D>doi: [10.7189/jogh.14.04179]</a></h4><p>Nur Sakinah Roslan 1, Yeong Yeh Lee 2, Yusof Shuaib Ibrahim 3, Sabiqah Tuan Anuar 3, Ku Mohd Kalkausar Ku Yusof 3, Lisa Ann Lai 4, Teresa Brentnall 4</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/microplastics-body.webp alt=image width=800><p>Background: Research on microplastics has largely focused on the environment and marine organisms until recently.

Extensive studies have been conducted on the toxic effects of PSMPs on the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, nerves, intestines and other tissues. However, the impact of PSMPs on vascular toxicity is poorly understood at present. The aim of this study was to reveal the vascular toxicity of microplastics (MPs).</p><p>Patients were assigned to a calcification group (25 patients) or a non-calcification group (22 patients) based on the presence or absence of calcification in the thoracic aorta wall. We detected 7 polymer types in human feces. Patients with vascular calcification (VC) had higher levels of total MPs, polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) in feces than patients without VC. The thoracic aortic calcification score was significantly positively correlated with the total MP abundance (Spearman r = 0.8109, p &lt; 0.0001), PP (Spearman r = 0.7211, p = 0.0160) and PS (Spearman r = 0.6523, p = 0.0471) in feces. We then explored the effects of PSMP exposure on normal and vitamin D3 + nicotine (VDN)-treated rats. PSMP exposure induced mild VC in normal rats and aggravated VC in VDN-treated rats.

Futher, cotton was also found in our study. The diversity and abundance of MPs were higher in blood samples than in cancerous tissues, and there was a significant positive correlation between diversity (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the diversity and abundance of MPs in cancerous tissues were higher than in paracancerous tissues. The dimensional sizes of MPs in these samples were also very similar, with the majority of detected MPs being smaller in size. Correlation analysis showed that patient&rsquo;s age correlated with the abundance of MPs in blood samples, body mass index (BMI) correlated with the abundance of MPs in cancerous tissues. Notably, the frequency with which patients consume bottled water and beverages may also increase the abundance of MPs. This study identifies for the first time the presence of MPs and cotton in cancerous and paracancerous tissues of human cervical cancer patients.

These tiny plastic particles have been detected across various environmental matrices, including air, water, soil, and food sources. While the adverse impacts of MNPs on wildlife and ecosystems are well-documented, understanding their effects on human health is still in its infancy. This study aims to comprehensively review existing case reports documenting adverse health outcomes associated with MNPs exposure. Through an extensive literature search, relevant articles were identified and analyzed. MNPs exposure primarily occurs through ingestion and inhalation routes. Health effects on the digestive system include oxidative stress, inflammation, dysbiosis, and metabolic disorders, with cases linking MNPs exposure to gastrointestinal injury and liver dysfunction. Respiratory system impacts include asthma exacerbation and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, particularly in industries involving plastic production. MNPs exposure has also been associated with nervous system conditions, reproductive toxicity, skeletal system interference, excretory system disruption, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite limited case reports, the widespread presence of MNPs warrants further investigation into their potential health risks. This study underscores the urgency of understanding and mitigating the adverse health effects posed by MNPs exposure. Further research is imperative in order to comprehensively assess and address the dangers associated with MNPs contamination in the environment.</p><p>{DIV(style=&ldquo;font-size:18px;&rdquo;)}** Topics: Health Effects on the: **Digestive System</p><p>Respiratory System</p><p>Nervous System</p><p>Reproductive system</p><p>Skeletal System</p><p>Cardiovascular System</p><p>Excretory System</p><p>{DIV}</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-and-human-body-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=human-toxicity-of-nano--and-microplastics---book-chapter-behind-paywall---june-2024>Human Toxicity of Nano- and Microplastics - book chapter behind paywall - June 2024</h4><p>Arely A.

This scientific investigation explores their origins, movements, and effects. Synthetic fibres, microbeads, and plastic manufacture are examples of primary sources; the fragmentation of bigger polymers is a secondary source. Nurdles are released during the plastic manufacturing process, wastewater from personal care items contains microbeads that infiltrate aquatic bodies, and contamination is caused by synthetic fibers shed from textiles. Larger polymers break apart as a result of external stresses like sunshine and mechanical forces. Microplastics find their way into ecosystems via soil, streams, atmospheric deposition, and the food chain. Deposition occurs on both terrestrial and aquatic surfaces as a result of atmospheric transport caused by wind and precipitation. Surface runoff and wastewater discharge contribute to accumulation in rivers, which affects aquatic life and may make its way into the food chain. Runoff and atmospheric deposition cause soil to accumulate, which has an impact on soil quality and agricultural output. Microplastics biomagnified in the food chain, putting human health at risk from eating polluted seafood. Determining human exposure and related health hazards requires an understanding of the origins and pathways of microplastics. Thorough risk assessments and mitigation tactics are necessary to reduce negative impacts on the environment and public health. To reduce pollution and protect public health, it is imperative to address the manufacture of plastics, regulate the presence of microplastics in consumer products, and support sustainable alternatives. This investigation emphasizes the necessity of multidisciplinary study and teamwork to address the intricate problems brought on by microplastics and safeguard environmental integrity and public health.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplasticsandtheirimplicationsforhumanhealthascientificexploration-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=micro-and-nanoplastics-in-plaque-45-x-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-events-and-death---may-2024-examinecomhttpsexaminecomresearch-feedstudy9k22m0-nbsp-new-england-journal-of-medicinehttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov38446676-behind-paywall-until-sept-2024>Micro and nanoplastics in plaque: 4.5 X higher risk of cardiovascular events and death - May 2024** <a href=https://examine.com/research-feed/study/9K22M0/>Examine.com</a>   <a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38446676/>New England Journal of Medicine</a> **behind paywall until Sept 2024</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/microplastics-cardiovascular.webp alt=image width=500><hr><h4 id=fish-ingesting-microplastics-have-gut-reproduction-brain-injury-etc-problems--may-2024-impact-of-microplastics-and-nanoplastics-on-fish-health-and-reproduction-aquaculture-httpsdoiorg101016jaquaculture2024741037-pdf-is-behind-a-paywall>Fish ingesting microplastics have gut, reproduction, brain injury etc, problems – May 2024** Impact of microplastics and nanoplastics on fish health and reproduction **Aquaculture <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741037>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2024.741037</a> PDF is behind a paywall</h4><p>lRaja Aadil Hussain Bhat a b, M.

Aquatic environments are ideal and ultimate sinks for the MPs. They are negatively impacting the physical and physiological fitness of various fish species. Virgin MPs and nanoparticles (NPs) compromise immune, digestive, and reproductive systems, induce intestinal dysbiosis, and may have transgenerational effects. Even prolonged exposure to small ambient levels of MPs in aquatic environments has been found to be associated with such hazards. Moreover, plastisphere formation in aquatic habitats provides an excellent source and carrier for transporting contaminants, antimicrobial-resistant genes, and pathogens. Numerous studies utilize artificially produced virgin MPs and NPs containing toxic chemicals. When these plastics interact with water and organisms, they release harmful compounds, leading to the promulgation of toxic effects. However, macroplastics undergo chemical degradation in nature, producing micro- and nano-sized particles that appear to have varying degrees of adverse impact on aquatic organisms, due to their presence in substantial diluting environments. The work done so far suggests that evaluations of MP impact in aquatic habitats should be performed at a mass scale and in diverse fish species to get a clear picture of this hazard. This article reviews the most recent literature available on the influence of virgin MPs and NPs on fish welfare, with a particular focus on their health and reproductive functions.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Plastic pollution, particularly in the form of MPs, has emerged as an urgent and significant global environmental concern (Li et al., 2021b; MacLeod et al., 2021; Williams and Rangel-Buitrago, 2022). Since the 1950s, the production of plastics has increased exponentially. Global plastic production reached a staggering 460 million metric tons (Mt) in 2019 and is projected to reach 1231 Mt. by 2060 (Forum, 2022). In 2018, China produced 107.7 Mt. of plastics, accounting for approximately 30% of global plastic production (Plastic Europe, 2019). It is estimated that approximately 11 million tons of plastic enter the oceans annually (UNEP, 2021). Plastic emission levels into aquatic habitats are predicted to range from 20 to 53 million tons annually by 2030, highlighting the alarming scale of this issue (Borrelle et al., 2020). Reports indicate that >170 trillion plastic particles are currently floating in the oceans, causing significant damage to livelihoods and ecosystem and this number is projected to triple in the next two decades (UNEP, 2021). The widespread adoption of plastic usage can be credited to its affordability, long-lasting quality, lightweight characteristics, and adaptability across diverse sectors such as food packaging, construction, automotive, electronics, sports, agriculture, healthcare, and furniture production (An et al., 2020; Europe Plastics, 2019; Osman et al., 2023).</p><p>Microplastics are smaller than 5 mm in diameter and pose notable ecological risks due to their widespread distribution throughout aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems (Lusher et al., 2017b). These MPs can be categorized as either primary (originally manufactured to be &lt;5 mm) or secondary (resulting from the decomposition of larger plastic objects) (Kershaw and Rochman, 2015). The significant growth in plastic manufacturing has resulted in massive amounts of plastic waste, a substantial portion of which eventually breaks down into MPs (Sharma and Chatterjee, 2017). On the other hand, NPs are formed from the degradation of MPs and are characterized by colloidal behavior, with a size range of 1 to 1000 nm (Gigault et al., 2018). These microscopic plastic particles can contaminate water bodies, soil, and air, leading to ecological imbalances and potential consequences for human well-being (Basri et al., 2021).</p><p>Microplastics, which originate from terrestrial activities such as plastic production, tire wear, agriculture, and plastic litter, enter aquatic environments through routes such as atmospheric deposition, coastal interactions, and runoff. Comprehensive solutions are crucial to tackling the complexity of MP pollution in aquatic ecosystems (Gesamp, 2016; Klein et al., 2015). Microplastics are present in all habitats of the open ocean and enclosed seas, including beaches, water columns surface waters, and the deep seafloor (Lusher, 2015). Wind-induced vertical movement within the water column, plays a crucial role in determining the dispersion of MPs within marine environments (Kukulka et al., 2012). Once released, MPs can remain in the environment for prolonged periods, causing detrimental effects on wildlife, ecosystems, and potentially human health (MacLeod et al., 2021; Ritchie and Roser, 2018). Microplastics can be ingested by a variety of organisms, including plankton (Carbery et al., 2018; Gunaalan et al., 2023; Rakib et al., 2023), fish (Abbasi et al., 2018; Bhuyan, 2022; Collard et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2023; Renzi et al., 2019), bivalves (Abidli et al., 2023; Khanjani et al., 2023), birds (Bilal et al., 2023; Brookson et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2023; Navarro et al., 2023), and mammals (Liu et al., 2023; Zantis et al., 2021), resulting in numerous adverse effects such as reduced reproductive success, impaired growth, and disruption of physiological processes Fish may consume MPs through two main pathways: direct ingestion (primary ingestion), in which they unintentionally perceive the MPs as food and ingest them, or accidental consumption (Worm et al., 2017), or indirectly (secondary digestion) by consuming prey that has already consumed these particles (Watts et al., 2014). The latter process, known as trophic transfer, may result in the accumulation of MPs in predators occupying higher trophic levels (Farrell and Nelson, 2013; Provencher et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). On the other hand, the amount of increased MP accumulation in predators at higher trophic levels is still unknown (Carbery et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2020). Furthermore, MPs contain additives from the manufacturing process that have a prominent capacity to absorb detrimental pollutants, such as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances, from the surrounding environment. The ingestion of MPs and subsequent accumulation of these contaminants within aquatic organisms has raised concern about the potential hazards and risks associated with MPs in marine ecosystems (Lusher et al., 2017a).</p><p>Wootton et al. (2021) demonstrated that 49% of the worldwide fish samples examined for MP consumption exhibited the presence of plastic particles (average of 3.5 pieces per fish), and the prevalence of plastic ingestion was higher in North American fish as compared to fish from other geographic regions. A comprehensive literature review conducted by Galafassi et al. (2021) emphasized the widespread and concerning problem of MP pollution in freshwater environments. The review documented instances of 199 species from 29 countries ingesting plastic, with over 60 research articles specifically dedicated to studying MP ingestion by wild freshwater fish. Interestingly, MPs have been found not only in the digestive tracts of fish but also in their gills, suggesting that the particles can translocate to different tissues within the organisms. Ingestion of MPs by fish poses a multifaceted threat to their health, including structural intestinal damage. It also introduces toxic substances that disrupt physiological processes (Montero et al., 2022). As a result, ingesting MPs introduces these toxicants into the fish&rsquo;s body, where they may cause extensive physiological disruptions such as endocrine disruption and oxidative stress. Furthermore, MPs are capable of accumulating in the digestive system, which may result in physical damage such as obstructions, inflammation, and hindrances in nutrient absorption. Thus, it is imperative to comprehensively examine the effects of MPs on fish health. Fig. 1 depicts the number of articles present in the public domain that explore the impact and presence of MPs in aquatic organisms. With escalating concerns about MP pollution and its potential effects on aquatic ecosystems, particularly fish populations, there is an urgent need for a consolidated and structured evaluation of the current state of knowledge in this area. This review article seeks to consolidate the current insights and knowledge available regarding the effects of MP on fish health.

When large waste materials are released into the environment, they undergo physical, biological, and photo-degradation processes that break them down into smaller polymer fragments known as microplastics (MPs). The time it takes for residual plastic to degrade depends on the type of polymer and environmental factors, with some taking as long as 600 years or more. Due to their small size, microplastics can contaminate food and enter the human body through food chains and webs, causing gastrointestinal (GI) tract pain that can range from local to systemic. Microplastics can also acquire hydrophobic organic pollutants and heavy metals on their surface, due to their large surface area and surface hydrophobicity. The levels of contamination on the microplastic surface are significantly higher than in the natural environment. The gut-brain axis (GB axis), through which organisms interact with their environment, regulate nutritional digestion and absorption, intestinal motility and secretion, complex polysaccharide breakdown, and maintain intestinal integrity, can be altered by microplastics acting alone or in combination with pollutants. Probiotics have shown significant therapeutic potential in managing various illnesses mediated by the gut-brain axis. They connect hormonal and biochemical pathways to promote gut and brain health, making them a promising therapy option for a variety of GB axis-mediated illnesses. Additionally, taking probiotics with or without food can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuro-inflammation, neurodegeneration, protein folding, and both motor and non-motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. This study provides new insight into microplastic-induced gut dysbiosis, its associated health risks, and the benefits of using both traditional and next-generation probiotics to maintain gut homeostasis** CONCLUSION (clipped from PDF) **At present, the main reason humans are exposed to MPs is the increasing consumption of plastic. MPs have the ability to absorb, release, and act as reservoirs for various toxic chemicals and heavy metals, allowing these toxins to enter the human body and cause serious health issues. As the concentration of MPs increases in the body, they begin to modulate several biochemical and physiological pathways by altering the gut-brain axis.</p><p>This can lead to</p><ul><li><p>inflammatory lesions,</p></li><li><p>tissue degradation,</p></li><li><p>ROS,</p></li><li><p>metal imbalance,</p></li><li><p>changes in gut phenotype,</p></li><li><p>gut barrier function,</p></li><li><p>endocrine secretion, and</p></li><li><p>neurodegeneration.</p></li></ul><p>While there is limited information on the stages of plastic in the human diet, it is evident that regardless of degradation, MPs contaminate the environment, enter the body through contaminated foods, and disrupt intestinal homeostasis.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that nano- and microplastics have various effects on the intestines, including</p><ul><li><p>disrupting intestinal homeostasis,</p></li><li><p>altering gut permeability, and</p></li><li><p>affecting levels of cytokine secretion.</p></li></ul><p>Since the human diet plays a significant role in disrupting gut microbes and causing disorders, probiotics are a suitable and compassionate therapeutic target to manage gut dysbiosis and</p><p>protect bi-directional axes such as the</p><ul><li><p>gut-brain axis,</p></li><li><p>gut-liver axis,</p></li><li><p>gut-lung axis, and</p></li><li><p>gut-skin axis.</p></li></ul><p>The altered gut induced by MP consumption also leads to oxidative stress, inflammation, and reproductive issues. Probiotics can effectively control ROS, inflammation, and reproductive problems.</p><p>In conclusion, probiotics play a crucial role in managing MP-induced gut dysbiosis. With the assistance of gene editing techniques, both conventional and next-generation probiotics may address many health-related concerns in the future. Given the increasing use of synthetic materials, further research is necessary to fully understand the harm that microplastics pose to human health and the environment, as well as to facilitate their complete eradication through cutting-edge gene editing technologies.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/micro-plastics-probiotics-brain-gut-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=impact-of-microplastics-on-human-health-and-aquatic-species---may-2024>Impact of microplastics on human health and aquatic species - May 2024</h4><p>Iliass Achoukhi1*, Yahya El Hammoudani1, Khadija Haboubi1, Lahcen Benaabidate2, Abdelhak Bourjila1, Mustapha El Boudammoussi1, Mohamed Moudou1, Hatim Faiz1, Abdelaziz Touzani1 and Fouad Dimane1</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mp-may-2024.webp alt=image width=900><p>Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a pervasive environmental challenge, with significant implications for both marine ecosystems and human health.

Nano-plastics (NPs) and microplastics (MPs), defined as particles smaller than 100 nanometers and 5 millimeters, respectively, raise concerns due to their ability to enter the human body through various pathways including ingestion, inhalation, and skin contact. Various investigators demonstrated that these particles may produce</p><ul><li><p>physical and chemical damage to human cells, tissues, and organs,</p></li><li><p>disrupting cellular processes,</p></li><li><p>triggering inflammation and oxidative stress, and</p></li><li><p>impacting hormone and neurotransmitter balance.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, micro- and nano-plastics (MNPLs) may carry toxic chemicals and pathogens, exacerbating adverse effects on human health. The magnitude and nature of these effects are not yet fully understood, requiring further research for a comprehensive risk assessment. Nevertheless, evidence available suggests that accumulation of these particles in the environment and potential human uptake are causes for concern. Urgent measures to reduce plastic pollution and limit human exposure to MNPLs are necessary to safeguard human health and the environment. In this review, current knowledge regarding the influence of MNPLs on human health is summarized, including toxicity mechanisms, exposure pathways, and health outcomes across multiple organs. The critical need for additional research is also emphasized to comprehensively assess potential risks posed by degradation of MNPLs on human health and inform strategies for addressing this emerging environmental health challenge. Finally, new research directions are proposed including evaluation of gene regulation associated with MNPLs exposure.</p><hr><h4 id=microplastics-linked-to-heart-attack-stroke-and-death---scientific-american-march-2024-use-incognito-web-page-to-access-it-without-a-subscriptionhttpswwwscientificamericancomarticlemicroplastics-linked-to-heart-attack-stroke-and-death---->Microplastics Linked to Heart Attack, Stroke and Death - Scientific American March 2024** <a href=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/microplastics-linked-to-heart-attack-stroke-and-death/>Use incognito web page to access it without a subscription</a> **&mdash;</h4><h4 id=plaques-were-removed-those-having-microplastics-had-a-45-x-increased-risk-of-stroke-heart-attack-etc---march-2024-plastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries---science-alerthttpswwwsciencealertcomplastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteriesutm_sourcesubstackutm_mediumemail-nbsp-the-following-is-the-text-without-hyperlinks-now-a-small-study-in-italy-has-found-shards-of-microplastics-in-fatty-deposits-surgically-removed-from-patients-who-had-an-operation-to-open-up-their-clogged-arteries--and-reported-their-health-outcomes-nearly-3-years-later>Plaques were removed: those having microplastics had a 4.5 X increased risk of stroke, heart attack, etc. - March 2024** <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Plastic Found Inside More Than 50% of Plaques From Clogged Arteries - Science Alert</a>   the following is the text without hyperlinks **Now, a small study in Italy has found shards of microplastics in fatty deposits surgically removed from patients who had an operation to open up their clogged arteries – and reported their health outcomes nearly 3 years later.</h4><p>Removing fatty plaques from narrowed arteries in a procedure called a carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of future strokes.</p><p>The team behind this new study, led by Raffaele Marfella, a medical researcher at the University of Campania in Naples, wondered how the risk of stroke – as well as heart attacks and death – compared between patients who had microplastics in their plaques and those who did not.</p><p>Following 257 patients for 34 months, the researchers found nearly 60 percent of them had measurable amounts of polyethylene in plaques pulled from their fat-thickened arteries, and 12 percent also had polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in extracted fat deposits.</p><p>PVC comes in both rigid and flexible forms, and is used to make water pipes, plastic bottles, flooring, and packaging.

Despite, the fate and effects of MPs and NPs in agro-ecosystems have not been clearly understood. However, recent studies showed that these polymers can be transported and accumulated in food crops, humans, and other organisms. The introduction of plastics into terrestrial land has led to the accumulation of MPs and NPs in food crops. The bioaccumulation has been found in stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Thus, causes a change in physicochemical activities in plants that leads to a decline in crop production. Further, MPs accumulation in human placenta and breast milk have been evidently proven in recent studies. MPs themselves are being potential vectors of pollutants, including anti-resistance genes, harmful microbes, heavy metals, and carcinogenic compounds. Alarmingly, these pollutants can be horizontally transferred to organisms along with the MPs and remain intact throughout the food chain. Poor solid waste management, inadequacy in plastic recycling, and application of MPs contaminated compost in agricultural practices are the major entry points of MPs into the agro-ecosystem. The collection of these results in this study will help both on-going and upcoming investigations on bioaccumulation of MPs and NPs in crops and their movement through the food chain.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;18&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-human-health-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=detection-of-various-microplastics-in-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery---july-2023>Detection of Various Microplastics in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery - July 2023</h4><p>&ldquo;Microplastic specimens were collected from 15 cardiac surgery patients, including 6 pericardia, 6 epicardial adipose tissues, 11 pericardial adipose tissues, 3 myocardia, 5 left atrial appendages, and 7 pairs of pre- and postoperative venous blood samples.

Minimal research exists on effects of microplastic ingestion on the oral bioavailability of minerals (Fe, Ca, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Mg) in the gastrointestinal tract via impacting intestinal permeability, mineral transcellular transporters, and gut metabolites. Here, mice were exposed to polyethylene spheres of 30 and 200 μm (PE-30 and PE-200) in diet (2, 20, and 200 μg PE g−1) for 35 d to determine the microplastic effects on mineral oral bioavailability.</p><p>Results showed that for mice fed diet amended with PE-30 and PE-200 at 2–200 μg g−1, Ca, Cu, Zn, Mn, and** Mg <strong>concentrations in the small intestine tissue were 43.3–68.8 %, 28.6–52.4 %, 19.3–27.1 %, 12.9–29.9 %, and</strong> 10.2–22.4 % **lower compared to control mice, suggesting hampered bioavailability of these minerals.</p><p>In addition, Ca and Mg concentrations in mouse femur were 10.6 % and 11.0 % lower with PE-200 at 200 μg g−1. In contrast, Fe bioavailability was elevated, as suggested by significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher Fe concentration in the intestine tissue of mice exposed to PE-200 than control mice (157–180 vs. 115 ± 7.58 μg Fe g−1) and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher Fe concentrations in liver and kidney with PE-30 and PE-200 at 200 μg g−1. Following PE-200 exposure at 200 μg g−1, genes coding for duodenal expression of tight junction proteins (e.g., claudin 4, occludin, zona occludins 1, and cingulin) were significantly up-regulated, possibility weakening intestinal permeability to Ca, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Mg ions. The elevated Fe bioavailability was possibly related to microplastic-induced greater abundances of small peptides in the intestinal tract, which inhibited Fe precipitation and elevated Fe solubility. Results showed that microplastic ingestion may cause Ca, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Mg deficiency but Fe overload via altering intestinal permeability and gut metabolites, posing a threat to human nutrition health.** Note by VitaminDWiki: Topical Magnesium would not be blocked by microplastics **&mdash;</p><h4 id=microplastics-and-human-health-integrating-pharmacokinetics---april-2023>Microplastics and human health: Integrating pharmacokinetics - April 2023</h4><p><a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2023.2195798>https://doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2023.2195798</a> FREE PDF</p><hr><h4 id=microplastics-as-an-emerging-threat-to-the-global-environment-and-human-health---july-2023>Microplastics as an Emerging Threat to the Global Environment and Human Health - July 2023</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/microplastics-chart.png alt=image width=600><ul><li>&ldquo;Exposure to microplastics can also pose potential health risks to humans, including respiratory and digestive problems, as well as disrupt sleep, contribute to obesity, and increase the risk of diabetes.&rdquo;</li></ul><p> ** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-as-an-emerging-threat-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a> **&mdash;</p><h4 id=microplastics-and-human-health-integrating-pharmacokinetics---april-2023-1>Microplastics and human health: Integrating pharmacokinetics - April 2023</h4><p><a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2023.2195798>https://doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2023.2195798</a> FREE PDF</p><hr><h4 id=the-plastic-within-microplastics-invading-human-organs-and-bodily-fluids-systems---nov-2023>The Plastic Within: Microplastics Invading Human Organs and Bodily Fluids Systems - Nov 2023</h4><p>Environments 2023, 10(11), 194; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/environments10110194>https://doi.org/10.3390/environments10110194</a></p><p>by Christian Ebere Enyoh 1,*ORCID,Arti Devi 1,Hirofumi Kadono 1,Qingyue Wang 1ORCID andMominul Haque Rabin 1,2ORCID</p><ul><li><p>1 Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, 255 Shimo-Okubo, Sakura-ku, Saitama City 338-8570, Japan</p></li><li><p>2 Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh</p></li></ul><p>Microplastics (MPs), small plastic particles resulting from the degradation of larger plastic items and from primary sources such as textiles, engineered plastic pellets, etc., have become a ubiquitous environmental pollutant.

Furthermore, the review emphasizes the importance of understanding the potential toxicological effects of MPs on various physiological processes within these organs and their broader implications for human health. This review also examines the pathways through which MPs can enter and accumulate in human organs and bodily fluids, shedding light on the intricate routes of exposure and potential health implications. It is worth noting that the invasive medical procedures may permit direct access of MPs to the bloodstream and tissues, serving as a potential contamination source.

Although previous studies have reported the environmental impacts of MPs, only a few studies have highlighted the occurrence of MPs in food products and their possible effects on human health. Recent investigations have identified MP particles in drinking water and other beverages, seafood, plant products, salt, sugar, and honey, raising an alarm over the safety and quality of these food items. Ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact of such food and other consumer goods are the common routes through which MPs may enter the human body and can have several deleterious health impacts including oxidative stress, inflammation, immunotoxicity, increased risk of neoplasia, cellular metabolism impairment, neurotoxicity, gut microbiome dysbiosis, disruption of reproductive system among others. A collective approach employing source control, recycling, biodegradable plastics, strengthening legislation, and bioremediation could be a promising and sustainable solution to control the MP pollution. The key challenge appears to standarize detection methods along with reducing the MP contamination from the food products as well as from the environment. Therefore, this review focuses on the occurrence of MPs in several food products, current methods of analysis, potential health impacts, and strategies to mitigate the widespread MP pollution. It also adds novel findings, knowledge gaps, and recommendations that can guide future research in this field.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;18&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/microplastics-feb-2024-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=the-potential-impacts-of-micro-and-nano-plastics-on-various-organ-systems-in-humans---lancet-jan-2024>The potential impacts of micro-and-nano plastics on various organ systems in humans - Lancet Jan 2024</h4><p>eBioMedicine 2024;99: 104901 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104901>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104901</a></p><p>Nurshad Ali, Jenny Katsouli, Emma L.

To determine whether and how vitamin D can impact that toxicity, fish were supplemented with a vitamin D-low diet and vitamin D-high diet.</p><p>Results: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) accumulated in zebrafish brain and intestine, resulting in brain blood-brain barrier basement membrane damage and the vacuolization of intestinal goblet cells and mitochondria. A high concentration of vitamin D reduced the accumulation of PS-NPs in zebrafish brain tissues by 20% and intestinal tissues by 58.8% and 52.2%, respectively, and alleviated the pathological damage induced by PS-NPs. Adequate vitamin D significantly increased the content of serotonin (5-HT) and reduced the anxiety-like behavior of zebrafish caused by PS-NPs exposure. Virus metagenome showed that PS-NPs exposure affected the composition and abundance of zebrafish intestinal viruses. Differentially expressed viruses in the vitamin D-low and vitamin D-high group affected the secretion of brain neurotransmitters in zebrafish. Virus AF191073 was negatively correlated with neurotransmitter 5-HT, whereas KT319643 was positively correlated with malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the expression of cytochrome 1a1 (cyp1a1) and cytochrome 1b1 (cyp1b1) in the intestine. This suggests that AF191073 and KT319643 may be key viruses that mediate the vitamin D reduction in neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity induced by PS-NPs.</p><p>Conclusion:** Vitamin D can alleviate neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity induced by PS-NPs **exposure by directionally altering the gut virome. These findings highlight the potential of vitamin D to alleviate the brain-gut-virome disorder caused by PS-NPs exposure and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of NPs toxicity in aquaculture, that is, adding adequate vitamin D to diet.

However, the implications of microplastics are not yet thoroughly understood. There is considerable complexity involved to understand their impact due to different physical–chemical properties that make microplastics multifaceted stressors. If, on the one hand, microplastics carry toxic chemicals in the ecosystems, thus serving as vectors of transport, they are themselves, on the other hand, a cocktail of hazardous chemicals that are added voluntarily during their production as additives to increase polymer properties and prolong their life. To date, there is a considerable lack of knowledge on the major additives of concern that are used in the plastic industry, on their fate once microplastics dispose into the environment, and on their consequent effects on human health when associated with micro and nanoplastics. The present study emphasizes the most toxic and dangerous chemical substances that are contained in all plastic products to describe the effects and implications of these hazardous chemicals on human health, providing a detailed overview of studies that have investigated their abundance on microplastics. In the present work, we conducted a capillary review of the literature on micro and nanoplastic exposure pathways and their potential risk to human health to summarize current knowledge with the intention of better focus future research in this area and fill knowledge gaps.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/potential-effects-of-microplastics-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=microplastics-pollution-as-an-invisible-potential-threat-to-food-safety-and-security-policy-challenges-and-the-way-forward---dec-2020>Microplastics Pollution as an Invisible Potential Threat to Food Safety and Security, Policy Challenges and the Way Forward - Dec 2020</h4><p>Int.

After serving their purposes, these plastics reach our water bodies as their destination and become ingested by aquatic organisms. This ubiquitous phenomenon has exposed humans to microplastics mostly through the consumption of sea food. This has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to make an urgent call for the assessment of environmental pollution due to microplastics and its effect on human health. This review summarizes studies between 1999 and 2020 in relation to microplastics in aquatic ecosystems and human food products, their potential toxic effects as elicited in animal studies, and policies on their use and disposal. There is a paucity of information on the toxicity mechanisms of microplastics in animal studies, and despite their documented presence in food products, no policy has been in place so far, to monitor and regulates microplastics in commercial foods meant for human consumption. Although there are policies and regulations with respect to plastics, these are only in a few countries and in most instances are not fully implemented due to socioeconomic reasons, so they do not address the problem across the entire life cycle of plastics from production to disposal. More animal research to elucidate pathways and early biomarkers of microplastic toxicity that can easily be detected in humans is needed. This is to create awareness and influence policies that will address this neglected threat to food safety and security.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nvisible-potential-threat-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>AI</span>
