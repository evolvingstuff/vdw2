#### Correcting Vitamin D Insufficiency Improves Some, But Not All Aspects of Physical Performance during Winter Training in Taekwondo Athletes.

Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2018 May 3:1-25. [doi: 10.1123/ijsnem.2017-0412.](https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2017-0412.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

* This is one of a very few trials to find any improvement in just 1 month

* It takes up to 2-6 months to raise the vitamin D levels, then another few months for the body to benefit from the improved levels

* 5,000 IU daily: Vitamin D levels  12 ng ==> 38 ng

* Note – Llow vitamin D levels are typical of indoor sports

* Note - Vitamin D especially increases fast-twitch muscles (used by Taekwondo)

* Note - Might have had a similar improvement with a [loading dose](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) of 150,000 IU ( 5,000 IU * 30 days)

#### Vitamin D₃ Supplementation Reduces the Symptoms of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection during Winter Training in Vitamin D-Insufficient Taekwondo Athletes: A Randomized Controlled Trial - Sept 2018

 **Still not much results since the trial lasted only 1 month and they monitored the respiratory track problems from the first day, even though it would take 2-4 months to restore the levels of vitamin D**
