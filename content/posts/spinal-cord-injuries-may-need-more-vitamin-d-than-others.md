#### Serum 25(OH)D, PTH and correlates of suboptimal 25(OH)D levels in persons with chronic spinal cord injury - June 2012

Spinal Cord. 2012 Jun 19. [doi: 10.1038/sc.2012.67.](https://doi.org/10.1038/sc.2012.67.)

Study design:Cross-sectional cohort study.

Objectives: To describe: 

* (1) the prevalence of suboptimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (serum 25(OH)D <75?nmol?l(-1)) and to identify correlates of vitamin D deficiency; 

* (2) the prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH)?7.0?pmol?l(-1)); and 

* (3) the relationships between serum PTH and 25(OH)D in adult men and women with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).

Setting: Outpatient services, including an osteoporosis clinic at a tertiary spinal cord rehabilitation hospital in Ontario.

Methods:Serum levels of 25(OH)D and intact PTH were acquired at enrollment. Clinical correlates of suboptimal vitamin D status were collected via interview and chart abstraction, and identified by univariate logistic regression analysis. Pearson correlations were run to assess the relationships between serum PTH and 25(OH)D. Significance was P<0.05.

Results:Thirty-nine percent of the cohort, comprised of 62 adult men and women with chronic SCI, had suboptimal serum 25(OH)D levels. 

Factors associated with suboptimal vitamin D levels included 

* having vitamin D assessed in the winter months (odds ratio (OR)=7.38, P=0.001), 

* lack of a calcium supplement (OR=7.19, P=0.003), 

* lack of a vitamin D supplement (OR=7.41, P=0.019), 

* younger age (OR=0.932, P=0.010), 

* paraplegia (OR=4.22, P=0.016), and 

* lack of bisphosphonate (OR=3.85, P=0.015). 

Significant associations were observed between serum PTH and 25(OH)D (r=-0.304, P=0.032) and between PTH and C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) (r=0.308, P=0.025).

Conclusions: Disruption of the vitamin D-PTH axis may contribute to the  **bone loss**  seen in the chronic SCI population. 

 **The threshold for optimal serum 25(OH)D levels in the chronic SCI population may be higher than in the non-SCI population** . 

Serum 25(OH)D level are likely important risk factors contributing to declining bone mass and increased fracture risk post-SCI.
