#### Summary of this page by Claude-2 - A Large Language Model (AI) Aug 2023

Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is an essential nutrient that plays important roles in red blood cell formation, cell metabolism, nerve function, and DNA synthesis. The PDF provides an overview of vitamin B12, including deficiency symptoms, optimal dosages, dietary sources, reasons people may need supplementation, and more.

* Vitamin B12 deficiency is common, affecting up to 40% of adults. Symptoms include fatigue, neurological problems like numbness and walking difficulties, psychiatric issues like depression, and cognitive decline.

* Older adults, vegans/vegetarians, and those with absorption issues are at highest risk of deficiency. Taking metformin and acid-reducing medications can also deplete B12 levels.

* Animal foods like meat, fish, eggs and dairy are the main natural sources of B12. Nutritional yeast and fortified foods can provide some B12 for vegetarians.

* Daily supplementation with  **2,500 mcg per week is recommended for adults under 50**  to prevent deficiency. 

   * Higher doses may be needed for the elderly and those with absorption issues.

* Sublingual, oral spray, and injectable B12 are better absorbed than standard oral tablets. Methylcobalamin may be preferable to cyanocobalamin.

* High dose  **oral**  B12 around 1,000 mcg provides little added benefit due to absorption limits. However, megadoses via injection can help rebuild stores.

* Vitamin B12 blood testing can screen for deficiency. Levels below 300 pg/mL indicate a deficiency. Low-normal levels may still cause symptoms in some.

* Treatment with B12 supplements or injections can reverse deficiency symptoms like cognitive decline and neuropathy, especially if caught early.

#### Asked: Apparently, there are two forms of Vitamin B-12. How are they different (Perplexity AI April 2024)

Vitamin B12 is available in several forms, with methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin being two of the most commonly discussed. These forms differ in their composition, bioavailability, and how they are processed by the body.

Methylcobalamin is a naturally occurring form of Vitamin B12 that is found in animal-based foods. It contains a methyl group (consisting of carbon and hydrogen), making it the most bioavailable form of Vitamin B12. This means it is the most readily absorbed by the body. Methylcobalamin is particularly important for nervous system health, brain function, and the synthesis of melatonin, which can affect sleep patterns and circadian rhythms. It also plays a crucial role in converting homocysteine to methionine, a process that can reduce vascular strain and support heart health. Research has shown that methylcobalamin can significantly improve visual accommodation, unlike cyanocobalamin, which appears to be ineffective in this regard.

Cyanocobalamin, on the other hand, is a synthetic form of Vitamin B12. It contains a cyanide molecule, which, although present in small, non-harmful amounts, must be removed and converted into methylcobalamin by the body for use. This conversion process indicates that cyanocobalamin is not as readily available for biological use as methylcobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is the most commonly supplemented form of Vitamin B12 due to its lower cost and chemical stability. However, its absorption rate is considered poorer compared to methylcobalamin, and it may be less effective for certain physiological functions, such as supporting nervous system health and improving visual accommodation.

In summary, the key differences between methylcobalamin and cyanocobalamin lie in their source (natural vs. synthetic), bioavailability, and how they are utilized by the body. Methylcobalamin is generally considered superior in terms of absorption and physiological benefits, particularly for nervous system health and visual function. Cyanocobalamin, while more cost-effective and stable, requires conversion by the body into a usable form, which may make it less efficient for certain health outcomes

#### B12 supplementation improved cognition (MMSE) in 3 months  - Feb 2020

 **Low Vitamin B12 Levels: An Underestimated Cause Of Minimal Cognitive Impairment And Dementia** 

Cureus, 12 (2), e6976 2020 Feb 13, DOI: 10.7759/cureus.6976

Shazia Jatoi 1, Abdul Hafeez 2, Syeda Urooj Riaz 3, Aijaz Ali 1, Muhammad Ishaq Ghauri 3, Maham Zehra 1

Background Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to impaired cognition and memory along with a sensation of tingling and numbness, an outcome of poor myelination. Elevated methylmalonic acid and serum homocysteine levels are markers of Vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated homocysteine levels are also often associated with Alzheimer's disease and stroke. We conducted this study to determine the effect of vitamin B12 replacement therapy on vitamin B12-deficient patients with noted cognitive impairment. 

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter study of patients with minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) to assess for Vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels. All patients found to be deficient in vitamin B12 underwent replacement therapy and were assessed again after three months via the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a review of symptoms. 

Results A total of 202 patients were included in the study. Of those, 171 (84%) patients reported marked symptomatic improvement after vitamin B12 replacement while MMSE scores improved in 158 (78%) patients. Of the remaining 44 patients who reported no symptomatic improvement, MMSE scores improved in 26 while 18 patients showed no MMSE score improvements. 

Conclusions Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to cognition, and replacement therapy may be an option to improve patient cognition outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm and refine the observed associations over a larger scale and to determine whether these findings will translate to a reduction in cognitive decline.

 **Conclusions from the end of the PDF** 

We found a clear association between low vitamin B12 levels and progressive cognitive

impairment; therefore, further studies are needed to confirm and refine the observed

associations over a larger scale and to determine whether this change will translate to a

reduction in cognitive decline. Moreover, we are in favor of screening for vitamin B12

deficiency, at least in the elderly population, to find and prevent the possible causes of this

deficiency state, as this can be an easily preventable cause of impending dementia before the

cognitive decline becomes irreversible.

#### B12. - March 2018

Adv Food Nutr Res. 2018;83:215-279. [doi: 10.1016/bs.afnr.2017.11.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.afnr.2017.11.005)

Smith AD1, Warren MJ2, Refsum H3.

The biosynthesis of B12, involving up to 30 different enzyme-mediated steps, only occurs in bacteria. Thus, most eukaryotes require an external source of B12, and yet the vitamin appears to have only two functions in eukaryotes: as a cofactor for the enzymes methionine synthase and methylmalonylCoA mutase. These two functions are crucial for normal health in humans, and in particular, the formation of methionine is essential for providing methyl groups for over 100 methylation processes. Interference with the methionine synthase reaction not only depletes the body of methyl groups but also leads to the** accumulation of homocysteine, a risk factor for many diseases **. The syndrome of pernicious anemia, characterized by lack of intrinsic factor, leads to a severe, sometimes fatal form of B12 deficiency. 

However, there is no sharp cutoff for B12 deficiency; rather, there is a continuous inverse relationship between serum B12 and a variety of undesirable outcomes, including 

* neural tube defects,

* stroke, and 

* dementia. 

The brain is particularly vulnerable; in children, inadequate B12 stunts brain and intellectual development. 

Suboptimal B12 status (serum B12<300pmol/L) is very common, occurring in 30%-60% of the population, in particular in pregnant women and in less-developed countries. Thus, many tens of millions of people in the world may suffer harm from having a poor B12 status. Public health steps are urgently needed to correct this inadequacy.

Objectives

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a metabolic disorder with many causes. The neurological features of vitamin B12 deficiency are heterogeneous <sup>[2]</sup>. Peripheral neuropathy often described <sup>[3]</sup>, but its frequency and its type is controversial <span>[1[]</span>. The present study was conducted to describe electro-clinical presentations of peripheral neuropathy in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Methods

A Retrospective review of 32 subjects with neurological abnormalities due to vitamin B12 deficiency, were subjected to a detailed motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of median, ulnar, external popliteal sciatic, internal popliteal sciatic and sural nerves. Patients that have another reason for neuropathy or another disease that can affect nerve conduction studies were excluded.

Results

The median age of the patients was 51 (± 16.57) years old, (range 18–84 years old), sex ratio (M/F) was 1.66 (20/12).

Clinical features of neuropathy: 

* paraesthesia, 

* hyporeflexia

* ataxia and limb weakness 

were present in 20 (62.5%) patients.

Electromyography showed abnormal nerve conduction in 

* 25 (78.12%) patients and it was normal in 7 (21.88%) patients. 

On nerve conduction study: 16 (50%) had axonal impairment, 3 (9.3%) had demyelinating neuropathy and 6 (18.75%) had mixed features. Eleven patients (34.37%) presented a pure sensory impairment and 14 (43.75%) presented mixed pattern sensory and motor impairment. 

All cases underwent treatment with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin treatment (daily injection of 1000 μg cyanocobalamin for 4 weeks, followed by injections of 1000 μg each month) with marked clinical and haematological improvement.

Conclusion:** We conclude that nearly 80% patients with neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency **had evidence of peripheral neuropathy which is mainly axonal with some demyelinating features. 

Sensory and motor nerve conduction were affected. 

Evolution is generally good if the treatment was initiated early.

In considering the vitamin B-12 fortification of flour, it is important to know who is at risk of vitamin B-12 deficiency and whether those individuals would benefit from flour fortification. This article reviews current knowledge of the prevalence and causes of vitamin B-12 deficiency and considers whether fortification would improve the status of deficient subgroups of the population. 

In large surveys in the United States and the United Kingdom,** '6% of those aged >60 y **are vitamin B-12 deficient (plasma vitamin B-12 < 148 pmol/L), with the prevalence of deficiency increasing with age.** Closer to 20% have marginal status (plasma vitamin B-12: 148-221 pmol/L) in later life. **In developing countries, deficiency is much more common, starting in early life and persisting across the life span. Inadequate intake, due to low consumption of animal-source foods, is the main cause of low serum vitamin B-12 in younger adults and likely the main cause in poor populations worldwide; in most studies, serum vitamin B-12 concentration is correlated with intake of this vitamin. In older persons, food-bound cobalamin malabsorption becomes the predominant cause of deficiency, at least in part due to gastric atrophy, but it is likely that most elderly can absorb the vitamin from fortified food. Fortification of flour with vitamin B-12 is likely to improve the status of most persons with low stores of this vitamin. However, intervention studies are still needed to assess efficacy and functional benefits of increasing intake of the amounts likely to be consumed in flour, including in elderly persons with varying degrees of gastric atrophy.** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/how-common-is-vitamin-b-12-deficiency.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> **** From PDF ***** “Although >70% of the vitamin is absorbed when intake is in the range of 0.1-0.5 ug, the ileal receptors for the vitamin B-12-intrinsic factor complex become saturated with higher intakes such that absorption falls to '50% of a 1-ug dose, 15% of a 10-ug dose, and 3% of a 25-50-ug dose” **---

#### B12 deficiency is sometimes associated with poor cognition, taking B12 reduced their cognitive problems - Feb 2021

Medical Journal Armed Forces India https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.11.003

Background

Vitamin B12 deficiency is an easily treatable cause of reversible dementia. It is likely to be more common in Indian population due to the traditionally vegetarian culture. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency in elderly patients (>60 years) with dementia attending the outpatient department.

Methods

This study was conducted in two phases. The first phase was a cross sectional observational study to estimate the prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency in the elderly population with dementia. The second phase was a pilot study done in subjects with Vitamin B12 deficiency to assess the change in cognition following Vitamin B12 supplementation.

Results

Out of 2920 study eligible subjects,**  200 were diagnosed as dementia **with Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score of ≤ 24.** Vitamin B12 deficiency was seen in 7.5% of patients **. Vitamin B12 deficiency was associated with shorter and more severe dementia. Macrocytosis was more common in Vitamin B12 deficiency (p value < 0.001) where as vegetarian diet did not show significant correlation (p value 0.69). There was a significant improvement in the median MMSE score in the intervention group with increase in MMSE by 2 points at 6-8 weeks and 3 points at 12 weeks (p value 0.009 and 0.003 by Mann Whitney test).

Conclusion

Prevalence of Vitamin B12 deficiency in dementia was 7.5%. It was associated with macrocytosis, shorter duration and more severe dementia. There was a significant improvement in median MMSE score at**  6 weeks and 12 weeks following Vitamin B12 supplementation. **---

#### Vitamin B-12 and the Gastrointestinal Microbiome - March 2022** A Systematic Review **behind paywall https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmab123

ABSTRACT

Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a major public health problem affecting individuals across the lifespan, with known hematological, neurological, and obstetric consequences. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin B-12 may have an important role in other aspects of human health, including the composition and function of the gastrointestinal (gut) microbiome. Vitamin B-12 is synthesized and utilized by bacteria in the human gut microbiome and is required for over a dozen enzymes in bacteria, compared to only 2 in humans. However, the impact of vitamin B-12 on the gut microbiome has not been established. This systematic review was conducted to examine the evidence that links vitamin B-12 and the gut microbiome. A structured search strategy was used to identify in vitro, animal, and human studies that assessed vitamin B-12 status, dietary intake, or supplementation, and the gut microbiome using culture-independent techniques. A total of 22 studies (3 in vitro, 8 animal, 11 human observational studies) were included. Nineteen studies reported that vitamin B-12 intake, status, or supplementation was associated with gut microbiome outcomes, including beta-diversity, alpha-diversity, relative abundance of bacteria, functional capacity, or short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production. Evidence suggests that vitamin B-12 may be associated with changes in bacterial abundance. While results from in vitro studies suggest that vitamin B-12 may increase alpha-diversity and shift gut microbiome composition (beta-diversity), findings from animal studies and observational human studies were heterogeneous. Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, microbiome outcomes may differ by cobalamin form and co-intervention. To date, few prospective observational studies and no randomized trials have been conducted to examine the effects of vitamin B-12 on the human gut microbiome. The impact of vitamin B-12 on the gut microbiome needs to be elucidated to inform screening and public health interventions.
