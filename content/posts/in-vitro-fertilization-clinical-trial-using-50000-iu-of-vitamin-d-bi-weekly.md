“Subjects allocated to the vitamin D group will take vitamin D 50,000IU per week from recruitment for 4 weeks, followed by 50,000IU once every 2 weeks throughout the IVF cycle until fetal viability is confirmed at 6 weeks (if pregnant), after which they will be switched to Materna. If not pregnant, they will continue Vitamin D 50,000IU once every 2 weeks until 6 months from randomization, during which they can undergo frozen-thawed embryo transfer.”
