Prior studies have shown reduced concentrations of vitamin D in CU and there are limited reports of potential beneficial role for vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of subjects with CU. We assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D deficient CU patients on the clinical outcome and inflammatory markers in South Indian patients with CU.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This randomized controlled trial involved 120 vitamin-D-deficient CU patients. Urticaria activity score (UAS7) and autologous plasma skin test (APST) status were assessed in all cases. CU patients were supplemented with vitamin D with a dose of 60,000 IU fortnightly for a period of 12 weeks, and those in the placebo arm received matched placebo. Five milliliters of blood was drawn from all study subjects at baseline and after 12 weeks to assess inflammatory markers.</p><p>Results</p><p>We observed a significant reduction in UAS7 scores after 12 weeks in the vitamin D treated group in comparison to that of placebo. We also noted a significant reduction of the inflammatory cytokines in the vitamin D-treated group.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Supplementation with vitamin D among patients with vitamin D deficient CU significantly decreases disease severity which is probably mediated through the reduction of systemic inflammation.</p><hr><h4 id=hives-treatment-augmented-by-60000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly--rct-june2015>Hives treatment augmented by 60,000 IU Vitamin D weekly – RCT June 2015</h4><p><a href=/posts/hives-treatment-augmented-by-60000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-rct>Hives treatment augmented by 60,000 IU Vitamin D weekly – RCT June 2015</a>, which has the following chart.</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/hives.jpg alt=image width=400><hr><h4 id=beneficial-role-for-supplemental-vitamin-d3-treatment-in-chronic-urticaria-a-randomizedstudy>Beneficial role for supplemental vitamin D3 treatment in chronic urticaria: a randomized study.</h4><p>Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2014 Feb 5. pii: S1081-1206(14)00012-X. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2014.01.010.>doi: 10.1016/j.anai.2014.01.010.</a></p><p>Rorie A 1, Goldner WAS 2, Lyden E3, Poole JA 4.</p><ul><li><p>1Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep, and Allergy Division, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, The Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.</p></li><li><p>2Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism Division, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, The Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.</p></li><li><p>3Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health; University of Nebraska Medical Center, The Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.</p></li><li><p>4Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep, and Allergy Division, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, The Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska. <a href=mailto:japoole@unmc.edu>japoole@unmc.edu</a>.</p></li></ul><p>BACKGROUND: Observational reports have linked vitamin D with chronic urticaria, yet no randomized controlled trial has been conducted.</p><p>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation would decrease Urticaria Symptom Severity (USS) scores and medication burden in patients with chronic urticaria.</p><p>METHODS: In a prospective, double-blinded, single-center study, 42 subjects with chronic urticaria were randomized to high (4,000 IU/d) or low (600 IU/d) vitamin D3 supplementation for 12 weeks.</p><p>All subjects were provided with a standardized triple-drug therapy (</p><ul><li><p>cetirizine,</p></li><li><p>ranitidine, and</p></li><li><p>montelukast)</p></li></ul><p>and a written action plan.

Compared with low treatment, the high treatment group demonstrated a trend (P = .052) toward lower total USS scores at week 12, which was driven by <strong>significant decreases in body distribution and the number of days with hives</strong> . Beneficial trends for sleep quality and pruritus scores were observed with high vitamin D3. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased with high vitamin D3 supplementation, but there was no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and USS scores. There was no difference in allergy medication use between groups.

Vitamin D is known to exert several actions in the immune system and to influence the function and differentiation of mast cells, central role players in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic urticaria. This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and susceptibility to chronic idiopathic urticaria. One hundred and fourteen patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria were recruited in this study along with one hundred and eighty-seven sex-matched and age-matched healthy volunteers as the control group. For each patient, the urticaria activity score was calculated, and autologous serum skin test was done. Vitamin D metabolic status was measured in serum as 25 hydroxyvitamin D using the enzyme immunoassay method. Patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria significantly showed lower levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to chronic idiopathic urticaria. There was a significant positive correlation between vitamin D levels and urticaria activity score. This study showed that patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria had reduced levels of vitamin D, while vitamin D deficiency could increase susceptibility to chronic idiopathic urticaria.</p><p><strong>Clipped from results</strong></p><p>Patients with CIU and particularly with true CIU, significantly showed lower levels of 25 (OH)D in</p><p>comparison with the control group (p=0.005) (Figure 1). However, considering AICU patients separately,</p><p>there were no significant differences in vitamin D levels between them and the control group (p=0.11). Vitamin</p><p>D deficiency was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to CIU (p=0.001). Individuals</p><p>with vitamin D deficiency showed a <strong>2.4-fold</strong> (95%CI: 1.4-4) risk of having CIU. In addition, vitamin D</p><p>deficiency significantly increased susceptibility to true CIU (p=0.001, <strong>OR=2.7</strong> , 95%CI: 1.4-5.1). However,</p><p>a slightly significant difference was detected between the controls and the AICU patients regarding vitamin D</p><p>deficiency (p=0.048, OR=2.04, 95%CI: 0.99-4.2)(Table 2).</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/hives-iran.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=chronic-urticaria-helped-by-300000-iu-of-vitamin-d-monthly-aug2015>Chronic Urticaria helped by 300,000 IU of vitamin D monthly Aug 2015</h4><p><strong>Does the replacement of vitamin D reduce the symptom scores and improve the quality of life in patients with chronic urticaria?</strong></p><p>J Dermatolog Treat. 2015 Aug 21:1-19.</p><p>Topal IO1, Kocaturk Goncu OE, Gungor S, Durmuscan M, Sucu V, Yıldırmak S.</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>Vitamin D plays a key role in the immune responses generated by lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells. Decreased vitamin 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels have been implicated in several allergic disorders, and the association between 25(OH)D levels and chronic urticaria (CU) symptom scores has been in a few studies. This study was performed to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the symptoms and quality of life scores in chronic spontaneous urticaria and on vitamin D levels in CSU patients in comparison with controls.</p><p>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</p><p>Fifty-eight CSU patients and forty-five controls were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of the disease; mild/moderate and severe urticaria. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were measured in the serum of CSU patients and compared with the control groups. In patients with 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 30 µg/L, 300.000 IU/month of vitamin D3 supplementation was added to standard therapy. The clinical improvement was evaluated after 3 months with urticaria activity score (UAS4) and Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL).</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in the CSU group compared to healthy subjects (p&lt;0.001). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 20 (µg/L) and insufficiency (&lt; 30 µg/L) was significantly higher in CSU patients than in control groups. In addition, 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in both mild-moderate and severe CSU patients than those of the controls (P=0.011 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Ninety-eight percent of patients (25(OH)D &lt; 30 µg/L) were treated with vitamin D3 (300.000 IU/month-1) supplementation, and after 12 weeks, these patients showed significant improvements in UAS4 and CU-Q2oL scores.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>This study supports the contributing and beneficial effects of vitamin D in the treatment of chronic urticaria. Replacement of vitamin D may provide improvement in both the severity of symptoms and quality of life scores in these patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/topal-io-2016.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=chronic-urticaria-alternative-treatments-include-vitamin-d---march2023>Chronic Urticaria alternative treatments include vitamin D - March 2023</h4><p><strong>THE ROLE OF ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC URTICARIA</strong></p><p>Review Actas Dermosifiliogr . 2023 Mar 3;S0001-7310(23)00171-0. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ad.2023.02.015>doi: 10.1016/j.ad.2023.02.015</a></p><p>W Keumala Budianti 1, S Mahri 1, D Almira 2</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/hives-adjuvant-therapy.jpg alt=image width=600><p><strong>Levels of Evidence</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/levels-of-evidence.jpg alt=image width=600><p>Recent guideline on the management of urticaria recommends second-generation H1-antihistamine as the first-line therapy, with dose increases of up to fourfold if inadequately controlled. However, the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is often disappointing, so additional adjuvant therapies are needed to increase the effectiveness of first-line therapy, especially in patients who are refractory to the increase of antihistamine doses. Recent studies recommend various adjuvant therapy modalities for CSU, such as biological agents, immunosuppressants, leukotriene receptor antagonists, H2-antihistamine, sulfones, autologous serum therapy, phototherapy, <strong>vitamin D</strong> , antioxidants, and probiotics. This literature review was made to determine the effectiveness of various adjuvant therapies in managing CSU.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/chronic-urticaria-alternative-treatments.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><p><strong>CIU = chronic idiopathic urticaria</strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-alsoweb>See also web</h4><ul><li><a href=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Endocrinology/GeneralEndocrinology/44289>Vitamin D Blog: Help for Hives?</a> MedPageToday</li></ul><blockquote><p>‘’ In the first week, both groups saw a 33% decrease in symptoms.
