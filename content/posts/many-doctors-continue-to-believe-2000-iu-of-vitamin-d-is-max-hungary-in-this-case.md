#### [VITAMIN D ALSO HELPS PREVENT BONE FRACTURES AND FIGHT CORONAVIRUS](https://semmelweis.hu/hirek/2021/12/06/a-csonttoresek-megelozeseben-es-a-koronavirus-elleni-kuzdelemben-is-segit-a-d-vitamin/)

 **The following is translated from Hungarian** 

In recent years, the proportion of vitamin D users in the winter months has increased significantly, 3-5 times. It has long been known that it is worthwhile to provide vitamin D supplementation during the winter, in sunless periods, but the recommended amount of so-called saturating vitamins in debilitated conditions, such as coronavirus disease, has been the subject of a new recommendation.

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for  **2,000 international units (IU) per day for a healthy, normal-weight adult between October and March** . This amount can be taken without medical supervision and is safe in the long run - says dr. Istv치n Tak치cs is a university professor. The director of the Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology at Semmelweis University adds: 

* 400 IU per day for infants and young children, 

* 1,000 IU in pre-school age, and 

* 2,000 IU in adolescence 

produced under pharmaceutical conditions in the fall and winter when we are not exposed to enough sunlight. In the spring and summer months - from April to October - we can provide our body with the necessary vitamin D by spending about half an hour a day in the open air, so we do not need to replenish it.

The professor also pointed out that the proportion of people consuming vitamin D has increased 3-5 times in recent years, but many people are not aware that too high a dose (6-10 thousand IU per day) can even have a detrimental effect on health in the long run. because it increases the amount of calcium in your urine and can cause kidney stones, among other things.

The first Hungarian single recommendation on vitamin D was adopted ten years ago by experts who renew the principles of vitamin D intake every 3-4 years in the light of new scientific findings. Most recently, the conference was organized by the Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology at Semmelweis University, where the latest scientific research was discussed by experts and the recommendation was also updated.

The recommended daily dose for vitamin D supplementation has not changed, but the novelty is that the required amount of vitamin - calculated with the vitamin requirements of 2000 IU for a healthy adult - can be supplemented either once a week (14 thousand) or once a month (60 thousand). 

No higher daily dose is required, except during severe COVID-19 disease, when the patient receives 12,000 IU for 5 days and then 4,000 IU during the hospital stay, thus saturating the vitamin D store, so it is called this is a saturating dose, the professor explains, suggesting a link between vitamin D deficiency and a more severe course of COVID infection.

Dr. Istv치n Tak치cs highlighted:

Vitamin D also plays an important role in bone metabolism, in the prevention and survival of tumors, especially colon and breast cancer, and in the fight against autoimmune diseases.

At the conference held at Semmelweis University in 2021, the Hungarian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, the Hungarian Society of Osteology and Osteoarthhrology, the Hungarian Society of Nephrology, the Hungarian Society for Clinical Oncology, the Hungarian Society of Endocrinology for Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Hungarian Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology The vitamin D recommendations have been updated with the participation of experts from the Menopause Society, the Hungarian Society of Pediatricians and the Hungarian Association of Rheumatologists.
