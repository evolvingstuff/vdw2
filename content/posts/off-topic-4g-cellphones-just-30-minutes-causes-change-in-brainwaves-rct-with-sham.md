OBJECTIVE: The motivation of this study is to evaluate the possible alteration of regional resting state brain activity induced by the acute radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure (30min) of Long Term Evolution (LTE) signal.

METHODS: We designed a controllable near-field LTE RF-EMF exposure environment. Eighteen subjects participated in a  **<span style="color:#00F;">double-blind, crossover, randomized and counterbalanced experiment including two sessions (real and sham exposure)</span>** . The radiation source was close to the right ear. Then the resting state fMRI signals of human brain were collected before and after the exposure in both sessions. We measured the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) to characterize the spontaneous brain activity.

RESULTS: We found the decreased ALFF value around in left superior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus and right paracentral lobule after the real exposure. And the decreased fALFF value was also detected in right medial frontal gyrus and right paracentral lobule.

CONCLUSIONS: The study provided the evidences that 30min LTE RF-EMF exposure modulated the spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in some brain regions.

SIGNIFICANCE: With resting state fMRI, we found the alteration of spontaneous low frequency fluctuations induced by the acute LTE RF-EMF exposure.

### Note by Henry Lahore of VitaminDWiki

As an electronics engineer I had investigated the previous generation of cellphones and decided that they could cause problems

So I made a web page on the [15 ways to reduce cell phone radiation.](http://www.henrylahore.com/ReduceCellPhoneRF.html)

This is the first study I have seen with LTE/4G technology.

It appears to be an extremely well-designed study

### [GreenMedInfo has a nice description of the study](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/30-minutes-exposure-4g-cell-phone-radiation-affects-brain-activity-new-study?utm_source=www.GreenMedInfo.com&utm_campaign=c6240afba9-Greenmedinfo&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_193c8492fb-c6240afba9-86748089)
