Purpose

This randomized controlled trial compared changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover in postmenopausal women with low bone mass randomized to 12 months of either risedronate, exercise, or a control group.

Methods

Two hundred seventy-six women with low bone mass, within 6 years of menopause, were included in analysis. Treatment groups were 12 months of (a) calcium and vitamin D supplements (CaD) (control), (b) risedronate + CaD (risedronate), or (c) bone-loading exercises + CaD (exercise). BMD and serum markers for bone formation (Alkphase B ) and resorption (Serum Ntx) were analyzed at baseline, 6, and 12 months.

Results

Using hierarchical linear modeling, a group by time interaction was found for BMD at the spine, indicating a greater improvement in the risedronate group compared to exercise (p ≤ .010) or control groups (p ≤ .001). At 12 months, for women prescribed risedronate, changes in BMD at the spine, hip, and femoral neck from baseline were + 1.9%, + 0.9%, and + .09%; in exercise group women, + 0.2%, + 0.5%, and − 0.4%; and in control group women, − 0.7%, + 0.5%, and − 0.5%. There were also significant differences in reductions in Alkphase B (RvsE, p < .001, RvsC, p < .001) and Serum Ntx (RvsE, p = .004, RvsC, p = .007) in risedronate women compared to exercise and control groups. For risedronate, 12-month changes in Alkphase B and Serum Ntx were − 20.3% and − 19.0%; for exercise, − 6.7% and − 7.0%; and for control, − 6.3% and − 9.0%.

Conclusion

Postmenopausal women with low bone mass should obtain adequate calcium and vitamin D and participate in bone-loading exercises. Additional use of BPs will increase BMD, especially at the spine.
