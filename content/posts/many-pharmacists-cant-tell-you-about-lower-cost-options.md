#### [Why Your Pharmacist Can’t Tell You That $20 Prescription Could Cost Only $8](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/us/politics/pharmacy-benefit-managers-gag-clauses.html) New York Times

* “The clauses force the pharmacists to remain silent as, for example, a consumer pays $125 under her insurance plan for an influenza drug that would have cost $100 if purchased with cash.”

> “Much of the difference often goes to the drug benefit managers.”

* Gag laws in most states

* “At least five states have adopted laws to make sure pharmacists can inform patients about less costly ways to obtain their medicines, and at least a dozen others are considering legislation to prohibit gag clauses… “

* “A consumer filling a prescription for a drug to treat diabetes or high blood pressure may owe $20 if he uses insurance coverage. By contrast, a consumer paying cash might have to pay $8 to $15.”

* North Dakota and a good law for consumers, but it being sued by Pharmaceutical Care Management Association,

   * “In North Dakota, a new law explicitly bans gag orders. It says that a pharmacy or pharmacist may provide information that “may include the cost and clinical efficacy of a more affordable alternative drug if one is available.”

   * “The North Dakota law also says that a pharmacy benefit manager or insurer may not charge a co-payment that exceeds the actual cost of a medication.”

#### Drug profit motives - personal note by Henry Lahore, Founder of VitaminDWiki

A few years ago I picked up 4 prescriptions for my father-in law.

One "prescription" was for a bottle of 12 aspirin,which cost $12  (325 mg = standard dose)

On the shelf at the drugstore was a bottle of aspirin costing $0.01 per pill

I suspect the pharmacist got about $4 for selling the "prescription"

I also suspect that the doctor was able to bill Medicare for making the prescription.
