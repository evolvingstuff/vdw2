#### Serum Vitamin D Levels in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes: A Retrospective Single-Center Analysis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS:

There is growing evidence supporting the role of innate immune deregulation and inflammation in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Vitamin D (VD) is known to be involved in various immune and epigenetic processes. This analysis aimed to evaluate serum VD levels in patients with MDS and to analyze associations between serum VD levels and disease characteristics.

METHODS:

Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)-D3), the major form of VD in human serum, were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay in 62 unselected patients with MDS. Associations between serum 25(OH)-D3 levels and disease characteristics were analyzed using Kendall's tau and two-sided p values.

RESULTS:

The median serum 25(OH)-D3 level was markedly reduced (17.5 ng/mL). Patients with lower-risk disease features had lower serum 25(OH)-D3 levels than patients with higher-risk disease features with regard to medullary blast counts (16 vs. 31 ng/mL, p < 0.001), the revised international prognostic scoring system (13 vs. 30.5 ng/mL, p = 0.001), and blood counts.

CONCLUSIONS:

We show that patients with lower-risk disease characteristics exhibit lower serum VD levels than patients with higher-risk disease characteristics. Whether these findings might reflect innate immune deregulation has to be investigated in further studies.
