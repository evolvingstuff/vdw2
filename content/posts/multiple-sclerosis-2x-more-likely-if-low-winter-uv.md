#### It appears that latitude has been considered a proxy for winter UVB for a long time

 **Comparisons of estimated economic burdens due to insufficient solar ultraviolet irradiance and vitamin D and excess solar UV irradiance for the United States.**

* " Latitude is assumed to be an index of wintertime vitamin D status as determined by serum 25(OH)D levels"

* "  In fact, for children living in Tasmania, Australia (41"-43" S), wintertime exposure to solar UVB radiation was a more important factor than summertime exposure for reducing the adult risk of MS (84)."
