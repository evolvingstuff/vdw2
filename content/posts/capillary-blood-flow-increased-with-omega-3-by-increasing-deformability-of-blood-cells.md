"Several studies has so far shown the effects of Omega 3 supplementation in RBC deformability in highly trained athletes. In one study trained cyclists were given a 6 week regime of either omega 3 supplementation or a ‘standard diet’ and then their red blood cell deformability was tested during a 1 hour cycle at 70% of V02 max at sea level and in an altitude chamber. The authors found there was a significant improvement in the deformability in the omega 3 supplemented group"
