* "While vaccinations are voluntary (in Japan), they are strongly recommended and widely practiced. Routine recommended vaccines, such as BCG (tuberculosis), DTaP (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus), HPV (human papillomavirus), and Japanese encephalitis vaccines, are primarily funded by regional governments. In contrast, some vaccines like hepatitis B, mumps, varicella, and rotavirus are considered voluntary and may involve out-of-pocket costs "
