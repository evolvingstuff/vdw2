Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type worldwide <sup>[1]</sup>. Continued efforts to improve treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer will be instrumental in reducing the death rates associated with this disease. In particular, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype of breast cancer has no targeted therapy available so it is essential to continue to work on any potential therapies. Vitamin K (VK), is known for its essential role in the clotting cascade. 

The anti-tumour properties of VK derivatives have been reported in both hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma. 

Our hypothesis was that menaquinone-4, the most common form of VK2 is an effective anti-cancer agent against breast cancer cell types. In this study we used a novel impedance-based live cell monitoring platform (xCELLigenceTM) to determine the effects of VK derivatives on the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231 and the HER2+ breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. 

Cells were treated with varying concentrations of menaquinone-4 (VK2) previously reported to have an anti-proliferative effect on human glioblastoma cells. After initial testing, these concentrations were adjusted to 

* 100μM, 

* 125μM and 

* 150μM. 

A significant dose-dependent, growth inhibitory effect was found when cells were treated at these concentrations. These effects were seen in both adhesion and proliferation phases and a dramatic reduction in cell growth. Additional analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with VK2 (100μM) in combination with a low glucose nutrient media showed a further decrease in adhesion and viability. This is the first study of its kind showing the real-time effects of VK derivatives on breast cancer cells and suggests that dietary factors may be an important consideration for patients.
