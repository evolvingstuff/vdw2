## A few quotes clipped from [DSM](http://www.dsm.com/en_US/html/dnpna/anh_swin_vit_d_req.htm) on swine and vitamin D

“Vitamin D becomes a nutritionally important factor in the  **absence of sufficient sunlight.** ”

“The  **colors of the skin**  are important in determining response to irradiation. Irradiation is less effective on dark-pigmented skin. This has been shown to be true for white and black breeds of hogs. White pigs have been shown to resist vitamin D deficiency signs about  **twice as long as colored pigs** ; an average of 45 minutes of daily exposure to January sunshine for two weeks was sufficient to cure rickets in white pigs in Minnesota (Cunha, 1977).”

* This is interesting - humans are told that there is no vitamin D to be obtained from the Minnesota sun in January

“It was generally assumed that for all but a few species, vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 are equally potent. For poultry and other birds and a few of the rarer mammals that have been studied, including some New World monkeys, vitamin D3 is many times more potent than vitamin D2 on a weight basis.  **Vitamin D3 may be 30 to 40 times more effective than the D2 form for poultry;**  “

   * Wonder how much vitamin D would be in lard if swine got a lot of vitamin D in their feed

   * Having extra vitamin D in swine feed might provide extra vitamin D in human diet (via lard, pork chops, bacon) without FDA "food fortification" restrictions
