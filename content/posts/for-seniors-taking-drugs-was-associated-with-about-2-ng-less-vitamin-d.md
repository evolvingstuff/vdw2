OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency and polypharmacy are common in the elderly. However, knowledge on the associations between the use of specific medicines and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is limited. The aim of this study was to (better) define the associations between the use of specific medicines and serum 25(OH)D.

METHODS: Two different cohorts (1995/1996 and 2002/2003) from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) were used for cross-sectional analyses. LASA is based on an age and sex-stratified random sample of the Dutch older population. Study participants were aged 65-88 years in the first cohort (n=1301) and 55-65 years in the second cohort (n=736). Serum 25(OH)D of users of several groups of medicines were compared with levels of non-users using multiple linear regression analysis.

RESULTS: Of all participants, 75.4% (first cohort) and 61.1% (second cohort) were using at least one medicine. In both cohorts, the number of medicines was associated with lower serum 25(OH)D. In the first cohort, after adjustment for confounding, 

* users of any kind of medicine, 

* loop diuretics and 

* inhaled corticosteroids (only men) 

had respectively 4.4 nmol/L (p<0.01), 4.7 nmol/L (p=0.04), and 7.3 nmol/L (p=0.02) lower serum 25(OH)D than non-users. 

In the second cohort (younger), the use of 

* oral antidiabetics, 

* calcium-channel blockers, and 

* ACE-inhibitors 

was associated with respectively 7.4 nmol/L (p=0.04), 7.7 nmol/L (p=0.01), and 7.6 nmol/L (p<0.01) lower serum 25(OH)D.

CONCLUSIONS: These data show that users of several medicines have lower serum 25(OH)D than non-users. 

Vitamin D supplementation may be considered in patients with chronic use of medicines.

## About 2 ng less for loop diuretics, inhaled corticosteroids

## About 3 ng less for oral antidiabetics, calcium-channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors

## Unknown:

* Low health ==> take drugs ==> lower vitamin D

* Low vitamin D ==> Low health ==> take drugs
