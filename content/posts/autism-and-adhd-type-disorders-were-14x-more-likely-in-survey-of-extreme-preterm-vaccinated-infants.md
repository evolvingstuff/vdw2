#### Review of the study on this page

 **[Studies Prove Vaccinated Children Are at Greater Risk of Serious Illness and Neurological Disorders](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/studies-prove-vaccinated-children-are-greater-risk-serious-illness-and-neurologic) GreenMedInfo May 2017** 

Infants are vaccinated at 8 weeks after actual birth, not expected birth.  

Thus a 10 week preemie would be vaccinated 2 weeks before the expected birth date
