Studies reporting blood levels of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were systematically identified in order to create a global map identifying countries and regions with different blood levels. Included studies were those of healthy adults, published in 1980 or later. A total of  **298 studies**  met all inclusion criteria. Studies reported fatty acids in various blood fractions including plasma total lipids (33.0%), plasma phospholipid (32%), erythrocytes (32%) and whole blood (3.0%). Fatty acid data from each blood fraction were converted to relative weight percentages (wt.%) and then assigned to one of four discrete ranges (high, moderate, low, very low) corresponding to wt.% EPA + DHA in erythrocyte equivalents. 

Regions with high EPA + DHA blood levels  **(> 8%** ) included the 

* Sea of Japan, 

* Scandinavia, and 

* areas with indigenous populations or populations not fully adapted to Westernized food habits. 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Very low blood levels (= 4%) were observed in </span>** 

* North America, 

* Central and South America, 

* Europe, 

* the Middle East, 

* Southeast Asia, and 

* Africa. 

The present review reveals considerable variability in blood levels of EPA + DHA and the very low to low range of blood EPA + DHA for most of the world may increase global risk for chronic disease.
