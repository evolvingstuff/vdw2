OBJECTIVE:To examine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in children with tic disorders (TD) and to explore the relationship between vitamin D level and TD.

METHODS:

One hundred and thirty-two children who were diagnosed with TD between November 2016 and May 2017 were enrolled as the TD group, including 8 cases of Tourette syndrome, 32 cases of chronic TD, and 92 cases of transient TD. One hundred and forty-four healthy children served as the control group. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from each child. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured using HPLC-MS/MS. The categories of vitamin D status based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level included: normal (>30 ng/mL), insufficiency (10-30 ng/mL) and deficiency (<10 ng/mL).

RESULTS:

Mean serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the TD group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.01).  **The rate of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in the TD group was significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.01).**  Mean serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the transient tic group was higher than in the TS group (P<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency might be associated with the development of TD, and the level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D might be related to the classification of TD.

 **Highlights** 

• Vitamin D deficiency might be associated with tic disorders. The relationships among serum 25(OH)D level, the risk of developing tics, and tic severity have not been investigated in children with tic disorders.

• Our data support an association between low serum 25(OH)D level and increased odds of tic disorder diagnosis in children.

• Large sample size studies are urgently needed to further clarify the correlation between serum 25(OH)D level and tic severity.

• Whether vitamin D supplementation should be considered as a potential treatment in children with tic disorders, especially those with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, needs further investigation.

The aim of this study is to evaluate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels in children with tic disorders and to explore the relationship between serum 25(OH)D level and tic severity. Children (n=179, 31 females, 148 males, mean age at diagnosis: 8.0±2.7 years old, age ranged from 3 to 14.5 years old) who were diagnosed with a tic disorder were enrolled as case group, 189 healthy children were recruited as control group. Serum level of 25(OH)D of each child was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used to assess tic severity. Mean serum level of 25(OH)D in the case group was significantly lower than that of the control group. The serum 25(OH)D level was significantly associated with tic severity after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). This study identified a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in children with tic disorders, and there was a negative correlation between the serum 25(OH)D level and tic severity. In the future, large sample size studies are urgently needed to further clarify this correlation.
