#### What health problems are associated with Ultraprocessed foods - Asked Perplexity AI  Aug 2024

Based on the search results, there is strong evidence that high consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes:

 **Increased Risk of Mortality** 

* 21% greater risk of death from any cause

* 50% increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related death

* 40-66% higher risk of heart disease-related death

 **Cardiometabolic Health Issues** 

* 12% greater risk of type 2 diabetes

* Increased risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

* Higher risk of cardiometabolic risk factors like high blood fats and low "good" cholesterol

 **Mental Health Disorders** 

* 48-53% higher risk of anxiety and common mental disorders

* 22% increased risk of depression

* Adverse sleep outcomes

 **Certain Cancers** 

* Higher risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer

 **Digestive Issues** 

* Increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis

 **Respiratory Problems** 

* Increased risk of asthma

The umbrella review published in the BMJ found direct associations between high intake of ultra-processed foods and 32 ( **71%** ) of the adverse health parameters they examined ([FREE PDF](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2023-077310))  

Researchers propose these negative effects may be due to the altered nutritional composition of ultra-processed foods, their food additives, and changes to the food matrix from processing.While more research is needed to prove causality, experts argue the evidence is convincing enough to warrant population-level strategies to reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods. In the U.S., ultra-processed foods currently make up nearly 60% of adults' diets and 70% of kids' diets, so reducing intake could have a major positive impact on public health.

#### Perplexity AI on Ultra-Processed Food Consumption [Jan 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-of-americans-eat-ultra-pr-LjerSWzDSoKs8OTHF5EZNQ)

The consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in America has reached alarming levels. 

Currently, approximately 57% of daily caloric intake for American adults comes from ultra-processed foods&nbsp;[1](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-12-12/unhealthy-ultra-processed-foods-now-half-of-calories-americans-eat-at-home)&nbsp;[8](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods). 

The situation is even more concerning for children, with about 67% of their daily calories coming from UPFs &nbsp;[8](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods).

 **Food Supply and Availability** 

 **73% of the food available on U.S. grocery store shelves is classified as ultra-processed** &nbsp;[3](https://foodtank.com/news/2022/11/database-indicates-u-s-food-supply-is-73-percent-ultra-processed/)&nbsp;[5](https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/the-overconsumption-of-ultra-processed-foods-in-the-united-states). 

 **Ultra-processed foods are typically 52% cheaper than less processed alternatives**  &nbsp;[3](https://foodtank.com/news/2022/11/database-indicates-u-s-food-supply-is-73-percent-ultra-processed/), making them more accessible to consumers.

 **Consumption Patterns** 

The consumption of UPFs has shown a consistent upward trend:

* From 2001-2002 to 2017-2018, UPF consumption increased from 53.5% to 57% of total caloric intake &nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34647997/)

* The intake of minimally processed foods decreased from 32.7% to 27.4% during the same period &nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34647997/)

 **Demographic Variations** 

While UPF consumption is high across all population groups, some notable patterns emerge:

* Hispanic adults consume significantly less ultra-processed foods compared to non-Hispanic white and Black populations &nbsp;[7](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/october/ultra-processed-foods.html)

* College graduates tend to eat fewer ultra-processed foods&nbsp;[7](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/october/ultra-processed-foods.html)

* Older adults (60+) showed the sharpest increase in UPF consumption over the past two decades &nbsp;[7](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/october/ultra-processed-foods.html)

 **Types of Ultra-processed Foods** 

The main sources of ultra-processed foods in the American diet are:

* Snacks and desserts: 33% of UPF energy intake&nbsp;[6](https://media.market.us/processed-food-statistics/)

* Ultra-processed breads: 21% of UPF energy intake&nbsp;[6](https://media.market.us/processed-food-statistics/)

* Ready-to-eat/heat meals: 16% of UPF energy intake&nbsp;[6](https://media.market.us/processed-food-statistics/)

* Beverages (including sugary drinks): 15% of UPF energy intake&nbsp;[6](https://media.market.us/processed-food-statistics/)

#### Why ultra-processed foods and their additives are harmful - Dr. Patrick video - July, Sept 2024

 **[Aliquot #111: Why ultra-processed foods and their additives are harmful](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/aliquot-111-ultra-processed-foods?utm_source=brevo&utm_campaign=aliquot-111-ultra-processed-foods&utm_medium=email&utm_id=766)** 

 **Can only be viewed by subscribers to her channel** 

Processed foods fall on a spectrum, from minimally processed (like oatmeal or canned tomatoes) to ultra-processed (like lunch meats and junk food). Minimal processing typically makes the nutrients in foods more bioavailable—even better for you. But ultra-processing typically removes many nutrients while adding a plethora of chemicals meant to color, flavor, and preserve the food.

In this Aliquot, I explain the science behind the risks associated with eating processed foods and offer advice on choosing healthier options.

 **WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS** 

* This umbrella review found consistent evidence of a higher risk of adverse health outcomes associated with greater ultra-processed food exposure Convincing and highly suggestive evidence (classes I and II) related to early death and adverse cardiometabolic and mental health

* These findings support urgent mechanistic research and public health actions that seek to target and minimise ultra-processed food consumption for improved population health

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the existing meta-analytic evidence of associations between exposure to ultra-processed foods, as defined by the Nova food classification system, and adverse health outcomes.

DESIGN: Systematic umbrella review of existing meta-analyses.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, as well as manual searches of reference lists from 2009 to June 2023.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of cohort, case-control, and/or cross sectional study designs.

To evaluate the credibility of evidence, pre-specified evidence classification criteria were applied, graded as convincing (“class I”), highly suggestive (“class II”), suggestive (“class III”), weak (“class IV”), or no evidence (“class V”). The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) framework, categorised as “high,” “moderate,” “low,” or “very low” quality.

RESULTS

The search identified 45 unique pooled analyses, including 13 dose-response associations and 32 non­dose-response associations (n=9 888 373). Overall, direct associations were found between exposure to ultra-processed foods and 32 (71%) health parameters spanning mortality, cancer, and mental, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic health outcomes. Based on the pre-specified evidence classification criteria, convincing evidence (class I)

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Multiple meta-analyses have aimed to consolidate original epidemiological research investigating associations between ultra-processed food and adverse health outcomes

However, no comprehensive umbrella review has been conducted to provide a broad perspective and evaluate the meta-analytic evidence in this area supported direct associations between greater ultra- processed food exposure and higher risks of incident 

* cardiovascular disease related mortality (risk ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 1.63; GRADE=very low) and

* type 2 diabetes (dose-response risk ratio 1.12, 1.11 to 1.13; moderate), as well as higher risks of 

* prevalent anxiety outcomes (odds ratio 1.48, 1.37 to 1.59; low) and combined

* common mental disorder outcomes (odds ratio 1.53, 1.43 to 1.63; low). 

Highly suggestive (class II) evidence indicated that greater exposure to ultra-processed foods was directly associated with higher risks of incident 

* all cause mortality (risk ratio 1.21, 1.15 to 1.27; low), 

* heart disease-related mortality (hazard ratio 1.66, 1.51 to 1.84; low), 

* type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.40, 1.23 to 1.59; very low), and 

* depressive outcomes (hazard ratio 1.22, 1.16 to 1.28; low), together with higher risks of prevalent 

* adverse sleep-related outcomes (odds ratio 1.41, 1.24 to 1.61; low), 

* wheezing (risk ratio 1.40, 1.27 to 1.55; low), and 

* obesity (odds ratio 1.55, 1.36 to 1.77; low). 

Of the remaining 34 pooled analyses, 21 were graded as suggestive or weak strength (class III-IV) and 13 were graded as no evidence (class V). 

Overall, using the GRADE framework, 

* 22 pooled analyses were rated as low quality, with 

* 19 rated as very low quality and

* 4 rated as moderate quality.

CONCLUSIONS

Greater exposure to ultra-processed food was associated with a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, especially cardiometabolic, common mental disorder, and mortality outcomes. These findings provide a rationale to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of using population based and public health measures to target and reduce dietary exposure to ultra-processed foods for improved human health. They also inform and provide support for urgent mechanistic research.

Couch, PhD, RD, Amit Patki, MS, Ana-Lucia Garcia Guarniz, MD, Aleena Bennett, MS, Michael Crowe, PhD, Marguerite R. Irvin, PhD, and W. Taylor Kimberly, MD, PhD 

Background and Objectives

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to cardiometabolic diseases and neurologic outcomes, such as cognitive decline and stroke. However, it is unclear whether food processing confers neurologic risk independent of dietary pattern information. We aimed to (1) investigate associations between UPFs and incident cognitive impairment and stroke and (2) compare these associations with other commonly recommended dietary patterns in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study. This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled Black and White adults in the United States from 2003 to 2007.

Methods

The NOVA system was used to categorize items from a baseline food frequency questionnaire according to the level of processing. Participants with incomplete or implausible self-reported dietary data were excluded. Consumption for each category (grams) was normalized to total grams consumed. Scores quantifying adherence to a Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet were also calculated. Incident cognitive impairment was defined using performance relative to a normative sample on memory and fluency assessments. Incident stroke was identified through adjudicated review of medical records.

Results

The cognitive impairment cohort (n = 14,175) included participants without evidence of impairment at baseline who underwent follow-up testing. The stroke cohort (n = 20,243) included participants without a history of stroke. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, a 10% increase in relative intake of UPFs was associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span> = 1.16, 95% CI 1.09–1.24, p = 1.01 × 10−5) and intake of unprocessed or minimally processed foods with lower risk of cognitive impairment (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.94, p = 1.83 × 10−4). Greater intake of UPFs (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.14, p = 1.12 × 10−2) and unprocessed or minimally processed foods (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.86–0.95, p = 2.13 × 10−4) were also associated with risk of stroke in multivariable Cox models. The effect of UPFs on stroke risk was greater among Black than White participants (UPF-by-race interaction HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.03–1.29, p = 1.50 × 10−2). Associations between UPFs and both cognitive impairment and stroke were independent of adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets.

Discussion

Food processing may be important to brain health in older adults independent of known risk factors and adherence to recommended dietary patterns.

#### Ultra-processed foods increase the risk of metabolic syndromes - Jan 2024

 **Consumption of ultra-processed foods could influence the metabolic syndrome odds: A cross-sectional study** 

Food Science & Nutrition January 2024 [https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.3938](https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.3938)

Sanaz Mehrabani, Niloofar Shoaei, Zainab Shateri, Moein Askarpour, Mehran Nouri, Parisa Keshani, Behnam Honarvar, Reza Homayounfar

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence has augmented globally during recent decades. Over the past years, the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has grown significantly worldwide. So, the present research investigated the association between UPFs and MetS in an Iranian sample. This cross-sectional research was conducted on people (n = 8841) in the Fasa cohort study, Fars province, Iran. The participants' dietary consumption over a year, UPF consumption, and MetS diagnosis were evaluated through a 125-item modified food frequency questionnaire, the NOVA food group classification, and the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program, respectively. The association between the quartiles (Q) of UPF intake and the odds of MetS was estimated using the backward LR method of multivariate analysis. 

In the multivariate model, after adjusting potential confounders, the association between UPF intake and the

* odds of MetS was significant (Q4: odds ratio (OR = 3.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.76–3.89). Also, the 

* odds of increasing triglycerides (TG), blood pressure, and fasting blood sugar (FBS) and decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were significantly higher in the last quartile compared to the first quartile of UPFs (TG: OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.49–1.97,

* blood pressure: OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.30–1.79, 

* FBS: OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.10–1.54, and 

* HDL-C: OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08–1.39). 

The current research found a relationship between UPF intake and MetS and its components, indicating a diet-containing UPFs can be related to the occurrence of noncommunicable diseases.

#### Increased Ultra-processed foods increase risks of Cancer and CVD by 9% - Lancet Dec 2023

 **Consumption of ultra-processed foods and risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases: a multinational cohort study** 

Lancet Regional Health Europe VOL 35, 100771, DEC 2023 DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2023.100771](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2023.100771)

Background

It is currently unknown whether ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumption is associated with a higher incidence of multimorbidity. We examined the relationship of total and subgroup consumption of UPFs with the risk of multimorbidity defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases in an individual among first cancer at any site, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study including 266,666 participants (60% women) free of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes at recruitment from seven European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Foods and drinks consumed over the previous 12 months were assessed at baseline by food-frequency questionnaires and classified according to their degree of processing using Nova classification. We used multistate modelling based on Cox regression to estimate cause-specific hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of total and subgroups of UPFs with the risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases.

Findings

After a median of 11.2 years of follow-up, 4461 participants (39% women) developed multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases. Higher UPF consumption (per 1 standard deviation increment, ∼260 g/day without alcoholic drinks) was associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12). Among UPF subgroups, associations were most notable for animal-based products (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12), and artificially and sugar-sweetened beverages (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.12). Other subgroups such as ultra-processed breads and cereals (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.00) or plant-based alternatives (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.02) were not associated with risk.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that higher consumption of UPFs increases the risk of cancer and cardiometabolic multimorbidity.

#### Perplexity AI on ultra-processed foods

##### Definition of ultra-processed foods -  March 2024

Ultra-processed foods are industrially manufactured food products made from substances extracted from foods or synthesized from other organic compounds. These foods are characterized by high amounts of sugar, oils, fats, salt, and other additives such as preservatives, colorings, and flavorings. They are designed to be highly profitable, convenient, and hyper-palatable, often with long shelf lives and sophisticated packaging 3 .

* Examples of ultra-processed foods include frozen meals, soft drinks, hot dogs, cold cuts, fast food, packaged cookies, cakes, and salty snacks 1 .

* These foods are distinct from unprocessed or minimally processed foods, which are whole foods with their vitamins and nutrients intact and may be altered only by removal of inedible parts, drying, crushing, roasting, boiling, freezing, or pasteurization to make them safe to consume and suitable to store 1 .

* The NOVA food classification system categorizes foods into four groups, with ultra-processed foods being one of them. This system focuses on the extent and purpose of food processing rather than food types or nutrients 3.

* Consumption of ultra-processed foods has been associated with higher risks of 

   * obesity, 

   * type 2 diabetes, 

   * cardiovascular diseases, and 

   * certain types of cancer. 

* Studies suggest that limiting the intake of ultra-processed foods may be an effective strategy for preventing and treating obesity and other health issues 1 3.

##### How do ultra-processed foods affect gut health? -  March 2024

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) negatively impact gut health by altering the gut microbiota, leading to inflammation and increasing the risk of chronic diseases. High consumption of UPFs is associated with changes in the composition of gut microbiota, favoring the development of inflammation. This inflammation is linked to a range of non-communicable diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases 1 3. 

UPFs often contain ingredients that can disrupt the gut microbiome, such as emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners, which may alter the microbiota composition and promote gut inflammation 1.

Additionally, diets high in UPFs are associated with lower adherence to healthier dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean diet, and can lead to an increase in energy intake and obesity, further exacerbating gut health issues 2. 

The consumption of UPFs is also linked to higher levels of harmful chemicals like phthalates and bisphenols, which can further impact gut health and overall well-being 1 .

#### Might the health problems of ultraprocessed reduced by adding vitamin D? Aug 2024

Based on the provided search results, there are several key points regarding the potential for vitamin D fortification to mitigate the negative health effects of consuming ultra-processed foods (UPFs):

1. UPF consumption is associated with vitamin D deficiency. A cross-sectional study found that high intake of UPFs was linked to twice the risk of vitamin D deficiency compared to low UPF consumption. This suggests that the nutrient-poor profile of many UPFs may contribute to inadequate vitamin D intake and status.

1. Vitamin D is important for optimal health, including mental well-being. Deficiency in vitamin D, along with other nutrients like B vitamins, has been linked to an increased risk of depression. Ensuring adequate vitamin D intake is crucial for supporting overall health.

1. Some processed foods are already fortified with vitamin D. Certain milks, juices, and breakfast cereals may have vitamin D added to them. This indicates that fortification of UPFs with vitamin D is feasible from a food manufacturing perspective.

1. However, vitamin D fortification alone is unlikely to fully negate the health risks of UPFs. These foods are typically energy-dense and high in unhealthy components like added sugars, saturated fats, and salt, while being low in beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The adverse health outcomes associated with UPFs, such as increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, are likely due to multiple factors beyond just vitamin D content.

In conclusion, while vitamin D fortification of UPFs may help address the issue of deficiency associated with high UPF intake, it is not a complete solution. Improving the overall nutritional profile of UPFs and emphasizing consumption of minimally processed, nutrient-dense whole foods should still be the primary strategies for promoting optimal health. More research is needed to fully understand the potential impact of vitamin D fortification on mitigating UPF-related health risks.

So:

Taking Vitamin D will most likely reduce some of the problems resulting for ultra-processed foods

Notice that the UP food health problems include: increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancer

those risks are reduced by Vitamin D 

In addition, supplementation reduces many other health problems associated with lower levels of Vitamin D (from any cause)
