Background: African Americans suffer disproportionately from diabetes and cardiovascular disease and are significantly more likely to have suboptimal concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>. 

The results of epidemiologic and observational studies suggest that there is a link between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of cardiometabolic disorders, which underscores the importance of maintaining healthy concentrations of 25(OH)D.

Objective: The objective was to investigate whether daily supplementation with 4000 IU vitamin D3 for 1 y would eliminate any disparities in circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men.

Design: Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured every 2 mo in 47 subjects who received a daily oral dose of 4000 IU vitamin D3 for 1 y.

Results: More than 90% of African Americans had serum concentrations of 25(OH)D <32 ng/mL, and approximately two-thirds had serum concentrations <20 ng/mL. Furthermore, there were significant disparities in serum concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men. 

Supplementation with 4000 IU/d for 1 y eliminated any significant differences in circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D between African American and white men.

Conclusion: The results of this clinical study show the feasibility and efficacy of this approach in the elimination of hypovitaminosis D, which is a widespread health disparity among African Americans. 

This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as [NCT01045109](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01045109)
