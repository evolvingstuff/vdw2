#### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the brain mapping and behavioral performance of children with ADHD: a double-blinded randomized controlled trials

Nutr Neuroscib. 2024 Jun;27(6):566-576. [doi: 10.1080/1028415X.2023.2233752](https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2023.2233752) PDF is behind a $65 paywall

Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the common neurodevelopmental diseases that are accompanied with EEG pattern changes and Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>. Neurofeedback provides a feedback signal to alleviate brain wave abnormalities and offers an alternative therapy for ADHD. This study aimed to investigate the concomitant effects of Vitamin D3 supplementation and Neurofeedback on children with ADHD.

Method: This study was implemented on children with an established diagnosis of ADHD who received multisession Neurofeedback therapy. The intervention and control groups received 50000 IU vitamin D3 capsules and placebo respectively once a week for 2 months. The background rhythm was measured using quantitative EEG both before and at the end duration of the therapy.

Results: All of the vitamin D3 treated children showed a significant increase in the 25(OH)D (46 ± 18, 28 ± 10 (ng/ml), p = 0.001) and serum calcium level (9.5 ± 0.5, 9.8 ± 0.3 (mg/dl), p = 0.003) compared to the baseline. There were a statistically significant decrease in the treatment group about theta relative power, theta/beta, and theta/alpha power ratios within two eyes conditions (p = 0.004). All the changes were significant within eye open state in the treatment group (2.4 ± 1.2, 1.7 ± 0.5, p = 0.01). There is a significant relationship between Connors scores and some brain waves improvement (in relative theta (r = 0.998) and theta-to-beta power difference score (r = 0.56) (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Concomitant use of vitamin D3 supplementation and neurofeedback, increases the serum level of this vitamin and reveal favorable electrophysiological results in children with ADHD.
