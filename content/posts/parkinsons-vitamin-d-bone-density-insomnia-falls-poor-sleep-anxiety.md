Objectives

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to determine whether serum vitamin D levels correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) and non-motor symptoms in patients with PD.

Materials & Methods

A consecutive series of 182 patients with PD and 185 healthy controls were included. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were measured by immunoassay, while BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between serum vitamin D levels and clinical data were evaluated using partial correlation analysis.

Results

Patients with PD had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels relative to healthy controls (49.75 ± 14.11 vs 43.40 ± 16.51, P < 0.001). Furthermore, PD patients with lower vitamin D levels had a significantly higher frequency of falls (P = 0.033) and insomnia (P = 0.015). They also had significantly higher scores for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; P = 0.014), depression (P = 0.020), and anxiety (P = 0.009). 

Finally, patients with PD also had a significantly 

* lower mean BMD of the lumbar spine (P = 0.011) and femoral neck (P < 0.001).

After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, vitamin D levels significantly correlated with 

* falls, 

* insomnia, and 

* scores for the PSQI, depression, and anxiety.

Conclusions

In patients with PD, vitamin D levels significantly correlated with falls and some non-motor symptoms. However, no associations were found between BMD and the serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with PD. Thus, vitamin D supplementation is a potential therapeutic for non-motor PD symptoms.

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD). Our aim was to determine whether serum vitamin D levels correlated with bone mineral density (BMD) and non-motor symptoms in patients with PD.

Materials &amp; Methods
A consecutive series of 182 patients with PD and 185 healthy controls were included. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured by immunoassay, while BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Results
Patients with PD had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels relative to healthy controls (49.75 ± 14.11 vs 43.40 ± 16.51, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, PD patients with lower vitamin D levels had a significantly higher frequency of falls (P = 0.033) and insomnia (P = 0.015). They also had significantly higher scores for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; P = 0.014), depression (P = 0.020), and anxiety (P = 0.009). 
Finally, patients with PD also had a significantly

After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index, vitamin D levels significantly correlated with

Conclusions
In patients with PD, vitamin D levels significantly correlated with falls and some non-motor symptoms. However, no associations were found between BMD and the serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with PD. Thus, vitamin D supplementation is a potential therapeutic for non-motor PD symptoms.
