While most journals have estab­lished conflict of interest policies for authors, fewer ex­tend these policies to peer reviewers.3 In many cases, jour­nals or editors may inquire about reviewer conflicts of inter­est and consider these while managing the peer review process, although publicly available reviewer conflict of interest dis­closures are rare. Reviewers of leading medical journals may have industry ties due to their academic expertise.</p><p>We sought to characterize payments by drug and medical device manufacturers to US peer reviewers of major medi­cal journals.</p><p>Methods | We identified peer reviewers for The BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, and The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) using each journal’s 2022 reviewer list. These journals were se­lected for their high impact factor and reputation as leading publications of original general medical research. Because re­viewer lists did not include affiliations, identification was con­ducted using Scopus and the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, which also provided sex and specialty information. We limited our cohort to US-based physicians due to use of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments database. Two independent abstractors (A.-L.N., L.M.) performed the search strategy for each reviewer, with dis­crepancies resolved by a third author (D.-D.N.).</p><p>We extracted general and research payments to the iden­tified peer reviewers between 2020 and 2022 from the Open Payments database, capturing payments from drug and medi­cal device manufacturers to US-licensed physicians.4 We ex­cluded ownership and investment interests because they are not equivalent to financial transfers and are less reliable than other general payments. Research payments included pay­ments to individual physicians and institutional payments for research where they served as principal investigators. Insti­tutional payments were dividedby the number of principal in­vestigators. Inflation-adjusted payment amounts in 2022 US dollars were calculated among those receiving payments.</p><p>We compared industry payments by sex and specialty using the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test with subse­quent Dunn pairwise testing accounting for multiple testing, respectively. Analyses were performed using Stata MP ver­sion 17.0 (StataCorp). Statistical significance was defined as a 2-sided P &lt; .05.</p><p>Ethics review was not required based on University of Toronto policy. Additional methods are available in the eAp- pendix in Supplement 1.</p><p>Results | Among 7021 reviewer names, including duplicates, we excluded 332 reviewers who were not searchable in Scopus, 3257 non-US reviewers, and 1325 nonphysicians. This left 1962 unique reviewers, of whom 145 (7.4%) had performed peer re­views for more than 1 journal.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022,1155 peer reviewers (58.9%) re­ceived at least 1 industry payment (Table 1). More than half (54.0%) of reviewers accepted general payments, while 31.8% received research payments.</p><p>Reviewers received $1.06 billion in industry payments be­tween 2020 and 2022, including $1.00 billion (94.0%) to indi­viduals or their institutions and $64.18 million (6.0%) in gen­eral payments. Consulting fees and speaking compensation unrelated to continuing medical education programs ac­counted for $34.31 million and $11.80 million, respectively. Over the 3 years, the median general payment was $7614 (IQR, $495- $43 069) and the median research payment was $153173 (IQR, $29 307-$835 637) among reviewers receiving such payments.</p><p>Male reviewers had significantly higher median total pay­ments ($38 959 vs $19 586) and general payments ($8663 vs $4183) than female reviewers. Statistically significant differ­ences in payments existed between specialties (Table 2).</p><p>Discussion | More than half of the 1962 US physicians included in this study who peer reviewed for the most influential medi­cal journals received industry payments in 2020-2022, with most payments for research. Research payments, especially those provided to an institution, may have different implica­tions than general payments for conflicts of interest. Peer re­viewers in this study received $64.18 million in general pay­ments between 2020 and 2022, representing a median general payment of $7614, larger than the median general payment to all physicians in 2018 of $216.5 Additional research and trans­parency regarding industry payments in the peer review pro­cess are needed. Limitations include that it was not known if existing relationships were relevant to the reviewed articles; that reviewers who were not US-based physicians and pay­ments from other entities such as insurance and technology companies were not captured, underestimating industry pay­ments to reviewers of these major journals; and that the find­ings may not be generalizable to other journals.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/payments-by-drug-and-medical-device-manufacturers-to-us-peer-reviewers-of-major-medical-journals.pdf>Download the JAMA PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382321"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382321",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382321"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382321"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382321"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382321"></script></body></html>
