This is taken from [US: 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee submits report](http://www.potatopro.com/news/2015/us-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-submits-report) 

Vitamin D is mentioned about 200 times in the submitted report - asking for comments

The massive report is too big(11 MBytes)  to have on VitaminDWiki

The proposed guidelines say that we need more vitamin D, but does not seem to say how much more nor how it can be accomplished.
