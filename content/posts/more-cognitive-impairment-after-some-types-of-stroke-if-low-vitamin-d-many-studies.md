#### 5X increased risk of poor cognition after minor stroke if low vitamin D - Aug 2023

 **Lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with severer white matter hyperintensity and cognitive function in patients with non-disabling ischemic cerebrovascular events** 

 **Unadjusted data, small study** 

J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis. 2023 Aug 31;32(10):107311. [doi: 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2023.107311](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2023.107311)

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the potential correlations among serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) and cognitive function in patients with non-disabling ischemic cerebrovascular events (NICE).

Methods: This was a prospective investigation of 160 NICE patients with age of 40 years or older. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). White matter lesions were evaluated by WMH using Fazekas scores. Spearman correlation analysis and linear regression models were used to identify the associations between serum 25(OH)D levels and cognitive function. Binary logistic regression analysis models were used to evaluate the predictable value of serum 25(OH)D levels and WMH for cognitive impairment.

Results: Patients with inadequate 25(OH)D levels had lower MoCA score (P=0.008), and a higher proportion of severe WMH (P=0.043). Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively associated with MoCA score (rs=0.185, P=0.019) while negatively related to the proportion of severe WMH (sWMH) (rs=-0.166, P=0.036).The association between 25(OH)D concentrations and MoCA score remained significant in linear regression (adjusted β=0.012, 95%CI:0.001-0.203).

Adjusted binary logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratio of cognitive impairment with insufficient 25(OH)D concentration was  **5.038**  (95%CI:1.154-21.988) compared with the sufficient group and the sWMH (OR=2.728, 95%CI:1.230-6.051) was identified as an independent risk factor for cognitive decline in NICE patients.

Conclusion: Serum 25(OH)D levels and white matter lesions were independently and significantly associated with cognitive impairment in NICE patients.

#### Association between vitamin D status and cognitive impairment in acute ischemic stroke patients: a prospective cohort study - 2018

OBJECTIVE:

Previous studies found that low vitamin D levels were modestly associated with risk of stroke and poor functional outcome after stroke. In addition, vitamin D deficiency has been linked with cognitive decline. Our study aimed to explore the potential relationship between vitamin D levels in the short-term acute phase of ischemic stroke and cognitive impairment at 1 month.

METHODS:

In total, 354 ischemic stroke patients were consecutively enrolled in the study and received 1-month follow-up. The serum levels of vitamin D were measured within 24 hours after admission. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at 1 month after acute ischemic stroke. Cognitive impairment was defined according to different education levels.

RESULTS:

According to MMSE scores, 114 participants (32.2%) had cognitive impairment at 1 month. Patients with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have cognitive impairment than those with vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D sufficiency (P<0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders in our Cox proportional hazards model, vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with the development of cognitive impairment in acute ischemic stroke patients.

CONCLUSION:

Independent of established risk factors, vitamin D deficiency in the short-term phase of ischemic stroke was associated with a higher incidence of 1-month cognitive impairment.
