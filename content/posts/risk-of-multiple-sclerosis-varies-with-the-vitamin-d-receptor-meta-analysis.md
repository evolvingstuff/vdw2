Background

The association between the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism and the risk of Multiple sclerosis (MS) has been evaluated in several researches. However, the findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. Therefore, we set out a meta-analysis of all eligible published case-control studies to obtain an exact evaluation of the association between VDR gene polymorphisms and MS.

Method

All relevant studies reporting the association between the VDR gene FokI (rs2228570), or/and TaqI (rs731236) or/and BsmI (rs1544410) or/and ApaI (rs7975232) polymorphisms and susceptibility to MS published up to May, 2019 were identified by comprehensive systematic search in the electronic database of web of science, Scopus, and PubMed. After that, the strength of association between VDR gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to MS was evaluated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

A total of 30 case–control studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall results suggested a significant association between TaqI polymorphism and MS risk under heterozygote genetic model (OR = 1.27, 95%CI = 1.01–1.59, random effect). Moreover, the pooled results of subgroup analysis declined presence of significant association under all defined genetic model. In subgroup analysis, BsmI polymorphisms was associated with increased risk of MS under recessive model in Asian populations. On the other hand, ApaI polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of MS under recessive and aa vs. AA model in Asian populations.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis suggested a significant association between TaqI polymorphism and MS susceptibility. Furthermore, BsmI polymorphism was associated with increased risk of MS in Asian populations. In contrast, ApaI polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of MS in Asian populations. Future large-scale studies on gene–environment and gene–gene interactions are required to estimate risk factors and assist early diagnosis of patients at high risk for MS.
