* Yet another review/meta-analysis which ignores the dose size used

* The same importance is given to 400 IU daily as 6,000 IU daily

* So, since most of the studies give only 400 IU, the great benefits of studies giving >4,000 IU remain hidden

* Surprisingly the vast majority of all studies (even with small doses) found an increase in birth weight - see chart below)
