##### A few quotes from New York Times article

* Among the top 5 percent of test scorers in elementary school, one in three weighed at least eight pounds at birth, compared with only one in four of all babies.

* The relationship between birth weight and test scores was present by the time children enrolled in kindergarten and remained fairly constant throughout elementary and middle school. 

* Other research has found that children who do better in elementary school are more likely to graduate from college, earn more as adults and live longer.
