Objectives:The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in obese and non-overweight children in North Texas, to examine relationships between dietary habits and 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level in obese children, and to examine the relationship between 25(OH)D level and markers of abnormal glucose metabolism and blood pressure.

Patients and Methods:Using a cross-sectional design, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, dietary information, serum 25(OH)D, fasting glucose and insulin, 2-h glucose from oral glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1c, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were recorded for 411 obese subjects (6-16 yr old) at an obesity referral clinic. 25(OH)D was also obtained from 87 control non-overweight subjects (6-16 yr old).

Results:Ninety-two percent of obese subjects had a 25(OH)D level below 75 nmol/liter, and 50% were below 50 nmol/liter. 

Among non-overweight subjects, these frequencies were 68 and 22%, respectively (both P < 0.01 compared with obese subjects). 

25(OH)D was negatively associated with 

* soda intake (P < 0.001),  (see [Cola Soft Drinks reduce Calcium and vitamin D](/tags/cola-soft-drinks-reduce-calcium-and-vitamin-d.html))

* juice intake (P = 0.009), and 

* skipping breakfast (P < 0.001). 

25(OH)D was negatively correlated with 

* homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (r = -0.19; P = 0.001) and 

* 2-h glucose (r = -0.12; P = 0.04) 

after adjustment for body mass index and age but was not correlated with hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure Z score, or diastolic blood pressure Z score.

Conclusions:Vitamin D deficiency is common in children in this southern United States location and is significantly more prevalent in obese children. 

Lower 25(OH)D level is associated with risk factors for type 2 diabetes in obese children.

And half of the obese children had vitamin D deficiency, compared with 22% of thinner kids, Hutchison and colleagues reported in the January issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

They were compared with 87 children -- matched to the obese group by season when the data was acquired, age, and race/ethnicity -- who were below the 85th percentile of BMI for age. They were a convenience sample of otherwise healthy patients being treated for  **congenital hypothyroidism, acquired primary hypothyroidism, or isolated growth hormone deficiency.** 

On average, the obese children had a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 49 nmol/L, compared with 67.5 nmol/L for the slimmer cohort. The difference was significant at P<0.0001.

"Our study found that obese children with lower vitamin D levels had higher degrees of insulin resistance," said lead author Micah Olson, MD, also of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
