Vitamin D and iron (Fe) insufficiency are frequently shown to co-exist. However, interrelationships that may occur between these two nutrients have not been explored during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between Fe and vitamin D status in pregnant adolescents (n = 158, aged 蠄 18 y), a group known to be at risk for suboptimal vitamin D and Fe status. At mid-gestation (26.0 ± 3.3 weeks of gestation), maternal 25(OH)D was significantly and positively associated with maternal hemoglobin (Hb) (R2 = 0.065, p = 0.005, n = 118), and inversely associated with maternal erythropoietin (EPO) (R2 = 0.028, p = 0.04, n = 144). Significant relationships between 25(OH)D and both Hb and EPO remained evident at delivery. A trend towards greater hepcidin at mid-gestation was observed among adolescents with 25(OH)D levels < 12 ng/mL compared to those with 25(OH)D levels 蠅 12 ng/mL (mean hepcidin 31.8 ng/mL and 28.0 ng/mL, respectively; p = 0.07). Teens with 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL were significantly more likely to be anemic at delivery compared to those with 25(OH)D 蠅 20 ng/mL (OR  **7.61** , p = 0.004). 

 **Of note, all teens with iron deficiency anemia at delivery were also vitamin D insufficient**  (< 20 ng/mL) (Fisher's exact test 2-tail p = 0.01). These findings are supportive of an interrelationship between vitamin D and Fe insufficiency and emphasize the need for additional studies investigating the mechanisms responsible for these findings.

* "After adjustment for age at enrollment and race, the odds of anemia at delivery was  **8 times**  greater in adolescents with delivery 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L than in those with 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L (P <0.001)"
