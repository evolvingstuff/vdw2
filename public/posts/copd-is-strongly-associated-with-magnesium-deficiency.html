Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) significantly impacts patients’ quality of life and burdens healthcare systems. Magnesium is crucial for lung function and reducing respiratory disease risk. This study investigates the association between Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS) and COPD and explores whether inflammatory markers mediate this relationship. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 30,490 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018. MDS was calculated based on diuretic use, proton pump inhibitors, renal function, and alcohol consumption. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between MDS and COPD, adjusting for potential confounders. Mediation analysis was used to examine the roles of neutrophils, serum albumin, and the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII). In the univariable logistic model, higher MDS was significantly associated with increased COPD risk. 

Specifically, compared to MDS = 0, the odds ratios (OR) for COPD were 

* 2.50, 4.12, 6.13, 8.53, and 7.81 for MDS = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). 

In the multivariable model, the ORs were 1.79, 2.25, 2.71, and 3.44 for MDS = 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). Higher neutrophil levels and SII were positively associated with increased COPD risk, while higher serum albumin levels were inversely associated. Mediation analysis indicated that neutrophils, serum albumin, and SII significantly mediated the MDS-COPD relationship. Higher MDS is significantly associated with increased COPD risk, mediated by systemic inflammation markers. Improving magnesium levels could potentially reduce COPD risk, warranting further research on magnesium supplementation in COPD prevention and management.

!!!!Exploring the association between magnesium deficiency and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in NHANES 2005–2018
Yixin Zhao, Hongwei Li, Zhenyu Wang, Yue Qi, Yu Chang, Yuguang Li, Dongsheng Xu &amp; Xiao Chen 
Scientific Reports volume 14, Article number: 25981 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-76374-1 

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) significantly impacts patients’ quality of life and burdens healthcare systems. Magnesium is crucial for lung function and reducing respiratory disease risk. This study investigates the association between Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS) and COPD and explores whether inflammatory markers mediate this relationship. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 30,490 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018. MDS was calculated based on diuretic use, proton pump inhibitors, renal function, and alcohol consumption. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between MDS and COPD, adjusting for potential confounders. Mediation analysis was used to examine the roles of neutrophils, serum albumin, and the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII). In the univariable logistic model, higher MDS was significantly associated with increased COPD risk. 
Specifically, compared to MDS = 0, the odds ratios (OR) for COPD were 
*2.50, 4.12, 6.13, 8.53, and 7.81 for MDS = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). 
In the multivariable model, the ORs were 1.79, 2.25, 2.71, and 3.44 for MDS = 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (all P &lt; 0.001). Higher neutrophil levels and SII were positively associated with increased COPD risk, while higher serum albumin levels were inversely associated. Mediation analysis indicated that neutrophils, serum albumin, and SII significantly mediated the MDS-COPD relationship. Higher MDS is significantly associated with increased COPD risk, mediated by systemic inflammation markers. Improving magnesium levels could potentially reduce COPD risk, warranting further research on magnesium supplementation in COPD prevention and management.
