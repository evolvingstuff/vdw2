#### [What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained) (FDA)

An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that  **there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives** . Taking into consideration input from the FDA, manufacturers decide whether and when to submit an EUA request to FDA.

#### If the FDA admitted that there are indeed proven alternatives (Vitamin D, Ivermetin, etc), it seems that the FDA would have have stop emergency use authorizations for the (profitable) vaccines
