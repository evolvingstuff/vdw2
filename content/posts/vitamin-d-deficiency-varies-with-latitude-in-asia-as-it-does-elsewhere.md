#### Vitamin D status and sun exposure in southeast Asia

Dermato Endocinology Volume 5, Issue 1   January/February/March 2013

Vitamin D deficiency is more common in South Asia and Southeast Asia than in appreciated. Most studies defined 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels of less than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) as vitamin D deficiency. With this cut-off level, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was about 70% or higher in South Asia and varied from 6â€“70% in Southeast Asia. The determinants for the variation of vitamin D status are skin pigmentation, aging, the sun protection behaviors such as application of a sunscreen, religious, lifestyle and nutritional differences. Advanced age is a known risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Interestingly, elderly in countries such as Korea and Thailand, had higher 25(OH)D levels when compared with young people. This widespread vitamin D deficiency problem especially in the young generation is an urgent health issue that needs to be remedied.
