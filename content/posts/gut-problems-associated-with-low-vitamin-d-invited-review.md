There is a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which is defined by a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> of lower than 20 ng/mL, in all populations of the world. Unfortunately, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes, including 

* cystic fibrosis (CF), 

* celiac disease (CD), 

* short bowel syndrome and 

* inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),

is higher than that in the general population, indicating the presence of disease-specific causative factors. In this review, we aimed to present clinical findings to highlight the roles of insufficient exposure to sunlight and inflammation in the development of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes. Furthermore, we aimed to present experimental evidence that supported a role of vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of IBD. 

Finally, we reviewed clinical intervention strategies aiming to normalize vitamin D status in and even to improve the conditions of patients and to discuss certain issues that needed to be addressed in future research.
