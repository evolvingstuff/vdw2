This review looks at the role of an alkaline diet in health. 

Pubmed was searched looking for articles on pH, potential renal acid loads, bone health, muscle, growth hormone, back pain,  **vitamin D**  and chemotherapy. 

Many books written in the lay literature on the alkaline diet were also reviewed and evaluated in light of the published medical literature. 

There may be some value in considering an alkaline diet in reducing morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases and further studies are warranted in this area of medicine.
