Despite the availability of various treatment options, no single agent consistently cures this condition. Vitamin D, with its immunomodulatory effects, emerges as a promising treatment avenue for AA.</p><p>Objective</p><p>To assess the safety and efficacy of intralesional vitamin D3 compared with intralesional triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) in AA. Also, the treatment response should be analyzed according to serum vitamin D3 levels.</p><p>Patients and methods</p><p>This randomized controlled trial involved 40 patients aged 12 years and older with patchy active AA involving less than 50% of the scalp. The patients were randomized into two groups: group A received intralesional TAC, and group B received intralesional vitamin D3. Each patient underwent four treatment sessions and two follow-up sessions at monthly intervals. Serum vitamin D3 levels were assessed at the baseline. The regrowth score (RGS) was used to assess clinical improvement.</p><p>Results</p><p>Both groups showed significant improvement in mean RGS at the 16th and 20th weeks compared with the fourth week (P&lt;0.001; for both groups at the 16th and 20th weeks). By the 20th week, the mean RGS reached 3.05 in group A and 2.55 in group B (P=0.398). No significant difference was found between good and poor responders regarding vitamin D levels. Trichoscopic signs of activity improved significantly in both groups, and both treatment modalities were safe, with minor side effects.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Intralesional vitamin D is comparable in efficacy and safety to intralesional TAC in patchy AA of the scalp. Also, the response to treatment was insignificantly influenced by the level of serum vitamin D.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/alopecia-areata-2025-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><h5 id=suspect-that-topical-nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-would-be-as-good-and-could-be-done-at-home>Suspect that topical nanoemulsion Vitamin D would be as good, and could be done at home</h5><p><strong><a href=/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-is-faster-and-better-many-studies>Nanoemulsion Vitamin D is faster and better - many studies</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=alopecia-areata--is-vitamin-d-the-only-treatment--meta-analysis-april-2023>Alopecia Areata – Is vitamin D the only treatment? – meta-analysis April 2023</h4><p><strong>Biomarkers in alopecia Areata: A systematic review and meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Autoimmun Rev. 2023 Apr 20;103339. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2023.103339>doi: 10.1016/j.autrev.2023.103339</a></p><p>Hiba Zaaroura 1, Anthony J Gilding 2, Cathryn Sibbald 3</p><p>Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune non-scarring alopecia that affects the scalp or any hair-bearing areas in the body. The pathophysiology of AA is complex, but Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines dysregulation, as well as chemokines, immunoglobulins and other biomarkers have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>Objective: To conduct a systematic review and Meta-analysis to identify biomarkers that reflect AA activity and severity that could be used to better assess disease activity and response in both trials and clinical practice.</p><p>Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PUBMED, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) from inception to December 2021. Articles reporting on associations between AA and serum clinical biomarkers (cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, immunoglobulins, and others) were included. Serum biomarkers were identified in patients with AA and were correlated with disease severity and patient characteristics (ex. age, sex, comorbidities). The quality of the studies was assessed using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&rsquo;s Quality Assessment Tool for Case-Control Studies. Meta-analysis pooling of the standardized mean differences (SMD) by the method of Cohen using the common-effect inverse-variance model was performed. For the Meta-analysis, data was pulled for all the markers with a minimum of 4 studies with means and standard deviations. Analysis of data reported as Median with range or inter-quartile range (IQR) revealed that the data was too skewed to recommend calculation and use of mean with standard deviation (SD). If the data were not skewed, mean and SD were calculated.</p><p>Results: One thousand seven hundred fourteen studies were screened, with 91 included, reporting on a total of 52 biomarkers. Meta-analyses revealed pooled SMD that were significant for interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and vitamin D.</p><p>Conclusions: Serum IL6 and CRP levels are significantly increased in patients with AA compared to healthy age and sex matched controls. Conversely, serum vitamn D levels are significantly decreased in patients with AA compared to healthy age and sex matched controls. This data has the potenail to influence the clinical guidelines for the diagnostic workup of AA to include testing the serum levels of CRP and vitamin D.</p><hr><h4 id=18x-increase-in-incidence-of-aa-if-covid-which-reduces-vitamin-d-to-cells---feb-2024>1.8X increase in incidence of AA if COVID (which reduces Vitamin D to cells) - Feb 2024</h4><p><strong>Risk of Alopecia Areata After COVID-19</strong></p><p>JAMA Dermatol. 2024;160(2):232-235. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2023.5559</p><p>" 43.19 per 10 000 person-years <span>[PY]</span>) was significantly higher than in controls (23.61 per 10 000 PY)</p><p><strong><a href=/posts/covid-variants-protect-themselves-by-deactivating-different-vdr-variants>COVID variants protect themselves by deactivating different VDR variants– March 2023</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=correlation-of-vitamin-d-and-vitamin-d-receptor-expression-in-patients-with-alopecia-areata-a-clinical-paradigm---dec-2017>Correlation of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor expression in patients with alopecia areata: a clinical paradigm - Dec 2017</h5><p>Int J Dermatol. 2018 Feb;57(2):217-222. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.13851>doi: 10.1111/ijd.13851</a></p><p>Daroach M1, Narang T1, Saikia UN2, Sachdeva N3, Sendhil Kumaran M1.</p><p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (Vit.D) deficiency has been reported in alopecia areata (AA).

Clinical details and serum Vit.D measurement and scalp biopsy for histopathology and VDR expression was performed in patients and controls at baseline and after 6 months of treatment of AA.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Mean age of patients and controls was 28.9 ± 9.96 and 31.17 ± 9.43 years, respectively. Mean SALT score in patients was 35.8 ± 27.5 with a median disease duration of 48 weeks. Mean serum Vit.D levels was 7.65 ± 4.50 ng/ml and 15.8 ± 11.47 ng/ml in patients and controls, respectively. Twenty-nine (96.7%) patients were Vit.D deficient (&lt;20 ng/ml), compared to 22 (73.3%) controls (P = 0.001). Serum Vit.D levels inversely correlated with severity of the disease (r = -256), P = 0.17, and duration of disease but did not correlate with pattern of AA and VDR expression in tissue samples. VDR expression was reduced in all patients and was normal in controls. Inverse correlation of VDR was noted with presence of inflammation on histology (P = 0.02). VDR upregulation post treatment was seen only in 13% of patients and demonstrated no correlation with response to treatment.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Vit.D deficiency in AA correlates inversely with disease severity and duration.

There are limited data on vitamin D in Alopecia Areata, an autoimmune disease which in our experience shows seasonality in most of its remitting-relapsing forms. Our results demonstrate the presence of insufficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D) in many patients with various clinical forms, correlated with the expected increase of the values of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH). This could suggest the possible clinical use of vitamin D in the management of this frustrating disease. <strong><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772915/>PDF is online</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=reduced-alopecia-scaring-with-higher-levels-of-vitamin-d---april-2018>Reduced Alopecia scaring with higher levels of Vitamin D - April 2018</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Status in Scarring and Non-Scarring Alopecia</strong></p><p>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2018.04.032>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2018.04.032</a></p><p>Rosalynn R.Z.
