Purpose of Review

To discuss the potential biological mechanisms between vitamin D and toxic metals and summarize epidemiological studies examining this association in pregnant women.

Recent Findings

We identified four plausible mechanisms whereby vitamin D and toxic metals may interact: nephrotoxicity, intestinal absorption of metals, endocrine disruption, and oxidative stress. Few studies have examined the association between vitamin D and toxic metals in pregnant women. North American studies suggest that higher vitamin D status early in pregnancy are associated with lower blood metals later in pregnancy. However, a trial of vitamin D supplementation in a pregnant population, with higher metal exposures and lower overall nutritional status, does not corroborate these findings.

Summary

Given ubiquitous exposure to many toxic metals, nutritional intervention could be a means for prevention of adverse outcomes. Future prospective studies are needed to establish a causal relationship and clarify the directionality of vitamin D and metals.
