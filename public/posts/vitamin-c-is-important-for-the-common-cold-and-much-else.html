Intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations. The common cold continues to place a great burden on society in terms of suffering and economic loss. After an overview of the literature on the effects of the separate administration of either vitamin C or zinc against the common cold, this article presents data from two preliminary, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, conducted with a combination of <strong>1000 mg vitamin C plus 10 mg zinc</strong> in patients with the common cold.</p><p>In both studies, a nonsignificant reduction of rhinorrhoea duration <strong>(range 9-27%)</strong> was seen. In pooled analyses of both studies (n=94), vitamin C plus zinc was significantly more efficient than placebo at reducing rhinorrhoea over 5 days of treatment. Furthermore, symptom relief was quicker and the product was well tolerated. In view of the burden associated with the common cold, supplementation with vitamin C plus zinc may represent an efficacious measure, with a good safety profile, against this infectious viral disease.</p><p>PMID: 22429343</p><hr><h2 id=vitamin-c-a-concentration-function-approach-yields-pharmacology-and-therapeutic-discoveries>Vitamin C: a concentration-function approach yields pharmacology and therapeutic discoveries</h2><p>Adv.

With i.v. infusion, pharmacologic ascorbate concentrations of 25-30 mmol/L are safely achieved. Pharmacologic ascorbate can act as a pro-drug for hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) formation, which can lead to extracellular fluid at concentrations as high as 200 μmol/L. Pharmacologic ascorbate can elicit cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and slow the growth of tumors in experimental murine models. The effects of pharmacologic ascorbate should be further studied in diseases, such as cancer and infections, which may respond to generation of reactive oxygen species via H(2)O(2).</p><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><hr><h2 id=vitamin-c-update-on-physiology-and-pharmacology>Vitamin C: update on physiology and pharmacology</h2><p>Br J Pharmacol. 2009 Aug;157(7):1097-110. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00282.x.>doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00282.x.</a> Epub 2009 Jun 5.</p><p>Mandl J, Szarka A, Bánhegyi G.</p><p>Department of Medical Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Patobiochemistry, Semmelweis University Budapest, Budapest, Hungary. <a href=mailto:mandl@puskin.sote.hu>mandl@puskin.sote.hu</a></p><p>Although ascorbic acid is an important water-soluble antioxidant and enzyme cofactor in plants and animals, humans and some other species do not synthesize ascorbate due to the lack of the enzyme catalyzing the final step of the biosynthetic pathway, and for them it has become a vitamin. This review focuses on the role of ascorbate in various hydroxylation reactions and in the redox homeostasis of subcellular compartments including mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Recently discovered functions of ascorbate in nucleic acid and histone dealkylation and proteoglycan deglycanation are also summarized. These new findings might delineate a role for ascorbate in the modulation of both pro- and anti-carcinogenic mechanisms. Recent advances and perspectives in therapeutic applications are also reviewed. On the basis of new and earlier observations, the advantages of the lost ability to synthesize ascorbate are pondered. The increasing knowledge of the functions of ascorbate and of its molecular sites of action can mechanistically substantiate a place for ascorbate in the treatment of various diseases.</p><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><hr><h2 id=high-dose-vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-therapy-in-the-treatment-of-patients-with-advanced-cancer>High-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid) therapy in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.</h2><p>Anticancer Res. 2009 Mar;29(3):809-15.</p><p>Ohno S, Ohno Y, Suzuki N, Soma G, Inoue M.</p><p>Department of Complementary and Alternative Medicine Clinical R&amp;D, Kanazawa University, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-8640, Japan. <a href=mailto:satoshio@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp>satoshio@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp</a></p><p>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate) has a controversial history in cancer treatment.

Inflammation and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival in many types of cancer.Vitamin C has been suggested as having both a preventative and therapeutic role in a number of pathologies when administered at much higher-than-recommended dietary allowance levels.Since in vitro studies demonstrated inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways by millimolar concentrations of vitamin C, we decided to analyze the effects of high dose IVC therapy in suppression of inflammation in cancer patients.</p><p>METHODS: 45 patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, skin cancer and B-cell lymphoma were treated at the Riordan Clinic by high doses of vitamin C (7.5 g -50 g) after standard treatments by conventional methods.CRP and tumor markers were measured in serum or heparin-plasma as a routine analysis. In addition, serum samples were collected before and after the IVCs for the cytokine kit tests.</p><p>RESULTS: According to our data positive response to treatment, which was demonstrated by measurements of C- reactive protein, was found in 75% of patients and progression of the inflammation in 25% of patients. IVC treatments on all aggressive stage cancer patients showed the poor response of treatment.There was correlation between tumor markers (PSA, CEA, CA27.29 and CA15-3) and changes in the levels of C-reactive protein.Our test of the effect of IVC on pro-inflammatory cytokines demonstrated that inflammation cytokines IL-1α, IL-2, IL-8, TNF-α, chemokine eotaxin and CRP were reduced significantly after treatments.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The high dose intravenous ascorbic acid therapy affects C-reactive protein levels and pro-inflammation cytokines in cancer patients. In our study, we found that modulation of inflammation by IVC correlated with decreases in tumor marker levels.In summary, our data support the hypothesis that high dose intravenous ascorbate treatments may reduce inflammation in cancer patients. Our results suggest that further investigations into the use of IVC to reduce inflammation in diseases where inflammation is relevant are warranted.</p><p><strong>A portion of the table of diseases and CRP</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/crp-reduction-with-vitamin-c-iv.jpg alt=image><p><strong>Figure 1 CRP generally decreased with IV vitamin C</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/crp-generally-decreased.jpg alt=image><p>C-reactive protein levels after intravenous vitamin C treatments are compared to CRP levels before treatments.</p><p>Data points (squares) under the diagonal line demonstrate a positive effect of treatment introducing CRP levels.</p><p>Data points above the diagonal indicate CRP increases after treatment.</p><p>PMID: 22963460</p><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><hr><h2 id=what-is-the-optimum-intake-of-vitamin-c-in-humans>What is the optimum intake of vitamin C in humans?</h2><p>Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2012;52(9):815-29. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.649149.>doi: 10.1080/10408398.2011.649149.</a></p><p>Frei B, Birlouez-Aragon I, Lykkesfeldt J.</p><p>Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA. <a href=mailto:balz.frei@oregonstate.edu>balz.frei@oregonstate.edu</a></p><p>The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin C has traditionally been based on the prevention of the vitamin C deficiency disease, scurvy.

Inclusion of other antioxidants in the model (lutein, zeaxanthin, retinol, β-carotene, and α-tocopherol) made only a small attenuation to the result (OR <strong>0.68</strong> ; 95% CI, 0.57-0.82; P &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Similar results were seen with vitamin C by type of cataract: nuclear cataract (adjusted OR 0.66; CI, 0.54-0.80; P &lt; 0.0001), cortical cataract (adjusted OR 0.70; CI, 0.54-0.90; P &lt; 0.002), and PSC (adjusted OR 0.58; CI, 0.45-0.74; P &lt; 0.00003). Lutein, zeaxanthin, and retinol were significantly inversely associated with cataract, but the associations were weaker and not consistently observed by type of cataract. Inverse associations were also observed for dietary vitamin C and cataract.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong association with vitamin C and cataract in a vitamin C-depleted population.</p><p>PMID: 21705085</p><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><hr><h2 id=low-vitamin-c--18x-more-likely-to-have-neck-pain---june-2016>Low vitamin C ==> 1.8X more likely to have neck pain - June 2016</h2><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27434504>Serum vitamin C and spinal pain: a nationwide study.</a></p><hr><h2 id=see-also-web>See also web</h2><ul><li><p><a href=http://www.lewrockwell.com/sardi/sardi144.html>Researchers Achieve Cancer-Killing Effect With Oral-Dose Vitamin C</a> Sardi 2010</p></li><li><p><a href=http://www.naturalnews.com/034591_vitamin_C_mega-dose_healing.html>Vitamin C mega-dosing continues to unleash healing miracles around the world</a> Natural News Jan 2012</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Dr. Levy: Less than 20 percent of IV C gets into cells.
