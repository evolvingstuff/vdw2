Objectives: (i)To measure 25-OH vitamin D levels in term infants at 10 weeks and 6 months and to correlate with maternal vitamin D levels at 10 weeks postpartum (ii)To evaluate infants at 6 months for rickets. 

Patients and Methods: 179 exclusively breastfed infant-mother pairs 96 appropriate-for-gestational age (Group1) and 83 small- for- gestational age infants (Group 2) recruited at 10 weeks. At 6 months 52 in group 1and 45 in group 2 were evaluated. Venous blood sample were collected at 10 weeks and 6 months in infants and at 10weeks in mothers for calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and 25-OH vitamin D estimation. 

Results: Mean 25-OH vitamin D levels of infants (n=97) were 11.55+/-7.17ng/ml at 10 weeks and 16.96+/-13.33ng/ml at 6 months (p<0.001). Mean vitamin D levels of infants in group 1 and group 2 did not differ at recruitment and 6 months (P>0.05)). Maternal vitamin D levels in group 1 and group 2 were 8.89+/- 5.97 and 9.87+/- 6.44 ng/ml respectively (P=0.44). Significant correlation was observed between 25-OH vitamin D of infants and mothers (P<0.05). At 10 weeks 55.67% infants, 70% mothers and at 6 months 44.33% infants had vitamin D <11ng/ml.  **At 6 months 16.49% infants developed rickets.** 

Conclusions: Exclusively breastfed infants and their mothers are Vit D deficient, hence the need to improve vitamin D status .
