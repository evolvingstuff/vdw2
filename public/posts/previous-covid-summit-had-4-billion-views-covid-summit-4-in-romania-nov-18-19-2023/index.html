<p>Early in the pandemic, the UN (through its subsidiary The World Health Organization (WHO)), jointly declared that a global vaccine passport was needed. In response, the leaders of the G-20 issued a declaration in 2022 supporting development of a global standard of vaccination for international travel and the establishment of &ldquo;global digital health networks&rdquo; that build on existing digital COVID-19 vaccine passports. In June 2023, a new initiative between the EU and the WHO for strategic cooperation on global health issues was announced. This agreement seeks to “bolster a robust multilateral system with WHO at its core, powered by a strong EU”.</p>
<p>The WHO will amend the International Health Regulations (IHRs) and develop a new agreement to govern the “pandemic prevention, preparedness and response&quot; of future outbreaks, which includes public health emergencies of any type. These changes are predicated on the G-20 global adoption of the “vaccine passports” mentioned above. These passports will collect and contain private health data, enable surveillance, tracking and control of individuals and populations worldwide.</p>
<p>The G-20 is working with the International Monetary Fund (the financial agency of the UN), the World Bank (which has a founding treaty relationship with the UN) and the Bank for International Settlements to formalize the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in banking systems.

<p>The pandemic has allowed world leaders to coalesce global administrative power under the guise of public health, which has been weaponized to gain control of passports, travel, banking and the international economy.

<p>Once international passports, CBDCs and elements of a command economy via the UN’s Agenda 2030 are put into place, the groundwork for a new world order will be complete.

The UN has been quietly gestating and building power for years prior to the pandemic through agreements such as “Agenda 2030”, and has now become a sovereign power unto itself.  This is the shadow global government that seeks to regulate every dimension of our lives.

##### Abstract: Taking back control and the better future coming

Robert W. Malone, MD, MS

Simple truths are what matter most.  Honest words, can change the world. We each hold the power to spread truth.  We all stand on the shoulders of giants who can guide us.

I am a physician and a scientist, highly trained and experienced in developing vaccines and other medicines. But I have also been a close observer and objector to the ethical breaches, mismanagement and widespread lies which have characterized public health response to the COVIDcrisis.

Integrity.  Dignity.  Community.  These three words summarize both what has been damaged during the COVIDcrisis, and how we can regain control of our personal lives and build a better future for ourselves and our children.

What options do you have when confronting the awesome power of governments, their militaries, their various domestic enforcers and their intelligence service agencies to deploy advanced PsyWar technologies on you, as they seek to cover up their misdeeds and control all information you are able to access, all speech you may wish to share with others, as well as your own personal thoughts, emotions, beliefs and your very soul?

It is tempting to play the victim, to go along to get along, to just let them have their way with you. To allow them to control you, and to control your future and that of your children. To self-victimize.

How can you prevent yourself from the epidemic disease of self-victimization? How can you prevent Corporate Media, the Administrative State and the Globalists from victimizing you?  It begins by recognizing that you, and you alone, choose how to define yourself.  You will become what you believe yourself to be.

You have the power of self-determination. You can choose to be a victim, or dyou can choose to be a warrior, a caregiver, a teacher, a mentor, or one of the many other roles that empower you as an individual.  But the path forward to a better future requires that each of us recognize that we have both a choice and an opportunity to personally commit to insisting on calling out lies and acting with integrity, respecting human dignity, and building community. 

###### Remember the words of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (on lying)

We know they are lying. 

They know they are lying. 

They know that we know they are lying. 

We know that they know we know they are lying. 

And still they continue to lie.

!!!!!Abstract:The Pandemic as a Catalyst for a New World Control.
Jill Glasspool-Malone, PhD

By globally synchronizing the public health response across the United Nations (UN) member states, new powers were granted to the UN. These universally applied regulations and multilateral agreements have created a vast interlocking public health network throughout the world, which in turn birthed a new, globalized administrative state.

The UN has been quietly gestating and building power for years prior to the pandemic through agreements such as “Agenda 2030”, and has now become a sovereign power unto itself.  This is the shadow global government that seeks to regulate every dimension of our lives.

Early in the pandemic, the UN (through its subsidiary The World Health Organization (WHO)), jointly declared that a global vaccine passport was needed. In response, the leaders of the G-20 issued a declaration in 2022 supporting development of a global standard of vaccination for international travel and the establishment of &quot;global digital health networks&quot; that build on existing digital COVID-19 vaccine passports. In June 2023, a new initiative between the EU and the WHO for strategic cooperation on global health issues was announced. This agreement seeks to “bolster a robust multilateral system with WHO at its core, powered by a strong EU”.

The WHO will amend the International Health Regulations (IHRs) and develop a new agreement to govern the “pandemic prevention, preparedness and response&quot; of future outbreaks, which includes public health emergencies of any type. These changes are predicated on the G-20 global adoption of the “vaccine passports” mentioned above. These passports will collect and contain private health data, enable surveillance, tracking and control of individuals and populations worldwide.

The G-20 is working with the International Monetary Fund (the financial agency of the UN), the World Bank (which has a founding treaty relationship with the UN) and the Bank for International Settlements to formalize the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) in banking systems. The BIS specifically refers to “the disruption caused by Covid-19” as a driver to create CBDCs.

The pandemic has allowed world leaders to coalesce global administrative power under the guise of public health, which has been weaponized to gain control of passports, travel, banking and the international economy. It is just a matter of time before these vaccine passports will be coupled with CBDCs. Then these passports can be used to deny the unvaccinated or other dissenters access to, or use of, both travel and their own money.

Once international passports, CBDCs and elements of a command economy via the UN’s Agenda 2030 are put into place, the groundwork for a new world order will be complete. This new administrative state, whose core power derives from the UN, is a spiderweb of rules, regulations, agreements and treaties.  It will be virtually unbreakable.  From there, it is only a matter of time until national sovereignty becomes an obsolete concept.

!!!!!Abstract: Taking back control and the better future coming
Robert W. Malone, MD, MS

Simple truths are what matter most.  Honest words, can change the world. We each hold the power to spread truth.  We all stand on the shoulders of giants who can guide us.

I am a physician and a scientist, highly trained and experienced in developing vaccines and other medicines. But I have also been a close observer and objector to the ethical breaches, mismanagement and widespread lies which have characterized public health response to the COVIDcrisis.

Integrity.  Dignity.  Community.  These three words summarize both what has been damaged during the COVIDcrisis, and how we can regain control of our personal lives and build a better future for ourselves and our children.

What options do you have when confronting the awesome power of governments, their militaries, their various domestic enforcers and their intelligence service agencies to deploy advanced PsyWar technologies on you, as they seek to cover up their misdeeds and control all information you are able to access, all speech you may wish to share with others, as well as your own personal thoughts, emotions, beliefs and your very soul?

It is tempting to play the victim, to go along to get along, to just let them have their way with you. To allow them to control you, and to control your future and that of your children. To self-victimize.

How can you prevent yourself from the epidemic disease of self-victimization? How can you prevent Corporate Media, the Administrative State and the Globalists from victimizing you?  It begins by recognizing that you, and you alone, choose how to define yourself.  You will become what you believe yourself to be.

You have the power of self-determination. You can choose to be a victim, or dyou can choose to be a warrior, a caregiver, a teacher, a mentor, or one of the many other roles that empower you as an individual.  But the path forward to a better future requires that each of us recognize that we have both a choice and an opportunity to personally commit to insisting on calling out lies and acting with integrity, respecting human dignity, and building community. 

!!!!!!Remember the words of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (on lying)
We know they are lying. 
They know they are lying. 
They know that we know they are lying. 
We know that they know we know they are lying. 
And still they continue to lie.
