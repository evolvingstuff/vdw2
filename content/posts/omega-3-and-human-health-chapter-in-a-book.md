Fats (triglyceride) are the main energy storage macromolecules in case of animal and have served not only as a structural component of cell membrane, in which they are anchored by phospholipid molecules. Fats are esters of fatty acids condensed with glycerol molecules. Fatty acids have been categorized into essential and nonessential fatty acids on the basis of the ability of an organism to biosynthesize them. Essential fatty acids (linolenic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids) cannot be biosynthesized by an organism so must be provided through diet. One of the essential families of fatty acids for humans is the omega-3 fatty acids which include ɑ-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These essential nutrients enhance quality of life by supporting hormones, inflammation, regulating blood coagulation, mental health of an individual. The present chapter explores in detail the biological functions and dietary benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids in regulating metabolism of the body and its protective role in prevention many diseases.
