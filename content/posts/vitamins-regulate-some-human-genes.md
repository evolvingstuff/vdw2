Epigenetic modifications play an important role in disease pathogenesis and therefore are a focus of intense investigation. Epigenetic changes include DNA, RNA, and histone modifications along with expression of non-coding RNAs. Various factors such as environment, diet, and lifestyle can influence the epigenome. Dietary nutrients like vitamins can regulate both physiological and pathological processes through their direct impact on epigenome. 

* Vitamin A acts as a major regulator of above-mentioned epigenetic mechanisms. 

* B group vitamins including biotin, niacin, and pantothenic acid also participate in modulation of various epigenome. Further, 

* vitamin C has shown to modulate both DNA methylation and histone modifications while few reports have also supported its role in miRNA-mediated pathways. Similarly,

* vitamin D also influences various epigenetic modifications of both DNA and histone by controlling the regulatory mechanisms. 

Despite the information that vitamins can modulate the epigenome, the detailed mechanisms of vitamin-mediated epigenetic regulations have not been explored fully and hence further detailed studies are required to decipher their role at epigenome level in both normal and disease pathogenesis. The current review summarizes the available literature on the role of vitamins as epigenetic modifier and highlights the key evidences for developing vitamins as potential epidrugs.
