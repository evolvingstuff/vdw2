#### [8 Signs Your Body Is Begging for Vitamin D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hbUuSzGHik) Bright Side  8 minute cartoon video

What are the signs of vitamin D deficiency? Vitamin D greatly influences the systems of our body from ensuring calcium supply to our bones to strengthening our immune system. We normally get this vitamin from foods, supplements, and the sun’s rays, but when something goes wrong and we face vitamin D deficiency, our body systems may break.

For example, sweating that seems a little excessive or not brought on by anything particularly obvious, however, can be a sign that you’re lacking vitamin D. So what other signs show a deficiency, how serious is the problem, and what can you do to get more of it? Here at Bright Side, we’ve studied the most common symptoms of low vitamin D levels and we want to tell you what we’ve found.
