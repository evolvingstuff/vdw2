Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care 13(4):p 1191-1199, April 2024. | DOI:[10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1481_23](10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1481_23)

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and vitamin D deficiency are becoming highly prevalent among general populations. Despite plausible biological mechanisms for the role of vitamin D in cardio-protection, a cause-and-effect relationship has not yet been established. The interest in vitamin D as a potential therapeutic target to attenuate cardiovascular risk has been raised. The question about the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for cardiovascular outcomes cannot be answered certainly for the moment. The association between hypovitaminosis D and CVD has been proven by some studies while other studies deny any such link. The present narrative review gives a comprehensive overview of studies on the potential impact of hypovitaminosis D on CVD. The potential role of vitamin D supplementation in the management of CVD is also evaluated. Particular emphasis is paid to those studies that achieve a high level of scientific evidence.

##### Note: Both Omega-3 and Magnesium also reduce cardio, hypertension and diabetes

 **Note also: Omega-3 and Mg both increase the amount of vitamin D getting into cells from the blood**
