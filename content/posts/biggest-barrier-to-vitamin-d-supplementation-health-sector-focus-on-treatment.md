#### Vitamin D deficiency prevention policies in Iran: a retrospective policy analysis

Front. Nutr., 23 August 2023 Volume 10 - 2023 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1249402

Aim: Iran has a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) than the global level. This study aimed to assess VDD prevention policies in Iran through a policy analysis of agenda setting using the multiple streams framework (MSF).

Methods: Using Kingdon's MSF model, this qualitative analytical study performed a policy analysis on vitamin D-related policies in Iran. The policy documents were reviewed, and in-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders (n = 27) using the framework analysis method. To categorize data and extract the related themes, MAXQDA version 10 was used.

Results: According to Kingdon's MSF theory, the problem stream included the high prevalence of VDD among Iranian infants (23.3%), adolescents (76%), and adults (59.1%). The policy stream was identified to focus on preventing programs for non-communicable diseases in the health sector. The political stream indicated that national and international support could provide a political climate for this issue.

Conclusion: According to our results, a window of opportunity for policymaking on VDD prevention has opened. However, there are some challenges related to the implementation of these policies. These include the dominance of a treatment-based view rather than a prevention-based approach in the health sector, economic problems, and restricted access to health services due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To strengthen and implement VDD prevention policies, the stakeholders need support from high-level policymakers.

!!!!Vitamin D deficiency prevention policies in Iran: a retrospective policy analysis
Front. Nutr., 23 August 2023 Volume 10 - 2023 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1249402

Aim: Iran has a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) than the global level. This study aimed to assess VDD prevention policies in Iran through a policy analysis of agenda setting using the multiple streams framework (MSF).

Methods: Using Kingdon&#39;s MSF model, this qualitative analytical study performed a policy analysis on vitamin D-related policies in Iran. The policy documents were reviewed, and in-depth interviews were conducted with stakeholders (n = 27) using the framework analysis method. To categorize data and extract the related themes, MAXQDA version 10 was used.

Results: According to Kingdon&#39;s MSF theory, the problem stream included the high prevalence of VDD among Iranian infants (23.3%), adolescents (76%), and adults (59.1%). The policy stream was identified to focus on preventing programs for non-communicable diseases in the health sector. The political stream indicated that national and international support could provide a political climate for this issue.

Conclusion: According to our results, a window of opportunity for policymaking on VDD prevention has opened. However, there are some challenges related to the implementation of these policies. These include the dominance of a treatment-based view rather than a prevention-based approach in the health sector, economic problems, and restricted access to health services due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To strengthen and implement VDD prevention policies, the stakeholders need support from high-level policymakers.
