Introduction.Vitamin D is involved not only in the regulation of calcium-phosphorus metabolism; it also plays an important role in maintaining muscle strength and neuromuscular conduction. Vitamin D was also shown to be protective against autoimmune and infectious diseases. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) - is a syndrome manifesting with a severe chronic physical, mental weakness, psychological disturbances, associated with impaired immunity, chronic infectious diseases. There are published data on the high prevalence of low levels of vitamin D in the British cohort of patients with CFS (1).

Aim.To assess the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency, physical status (SPPB), and their change after treatment with 150000 IU of cholecalciferol in patients with (CFS+) and without CFS (CFS-).

Materials and methods.The study included 81 women aged 40 to 60 years (median age - 53 ± 4 years), 29 of which were diagnosed with the CFS using CDC criteria (1994). Vitamin D levels were evaluated during the period from late June till September by LIASON 25OH total vitamin D assay (DiaSorin Inc.). SPPB test was assessed before and after period of treatment. The treatment group consisted of 11 CFS+ and 32 CFS- patients with levels of vitamin D <30 ng/ml.

Results.The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, defined as a level less than 20 ng/ml was 54% in patients with CFS and 74% in the control group (p> 0.05), the optimal level of vitamin D (≥30 ng/ml) was observed in 10% and 14% of patients, respectively (p> 0.05). Medical therapy with  **cholecalciferol (25000 IU a week orally during 6 weeks)**  resulted in improvement of SPPB score from 8.7 to 9.3 in CFS+ group (p=0,02) and from 9.2 to 9.4 in CFS- group (p=0.01) and a decrease in number of minor diagnostic criteria symptoms for CFS from 5.3 to 4.9 in CFS+ group (p=0,04) and from 3.3 to 2.1 in CFS- group (p=0.000004). The studied parameters did not correlate with levels of vitamin D before and after treatment and with the delta change in vitamin D concentration.

Conclusions. There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in perimenopausal women during period of sufficient insolation irrespective of CFS presence. Vitamin D treatment seems to improve physical functioning but the mechanisms need to be further elucidated.
