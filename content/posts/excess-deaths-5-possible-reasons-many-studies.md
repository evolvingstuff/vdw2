#### Chart of excess deaths vs % vaccination of German states - Feb 2024

 **Differential Increases in Excess Mortality in the German Federal States During the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)** 

DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.13098.18880

Background: The present study investigates the influence of COVID-19 on mortality in the sixteen German federal states. To examine this issue, we estimate the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic separately for each federal state by calculating state-specific excess mortalities for the three pandemic years and explore a number of key state-specific quantities to determine the extent to which these covary with the excess mortality. Among the explored quantities are aspects related to the pandemic (strength of measures, COVID-19 infections and vaccination rates) and aspects unrelated to the pandemic (mean age, gross domestic products, poverty rates, proportions of people in need of care). Methods: To estimate excess mortality, we compare in each federal state the observed number of all-cause deaths with the number of the statistically expected all-cause deaths. To estimate the expected number of deaths, we use German life tables and longevity trends, and state-specific population tables and state-factors. The results yield for each federal state separate estimates for the expected number of all-cause deaths if there had been no pandemic. 

Results: Excess Mortality varied substantially across federal states in each of the pandemic years. In nearly all states, excess mortality was small in the first pandemic year, increased in the second and even more in the third pandemic years. The increase varied substantially across the federal states as well. Regarding the covariations with the explored state-specific quantities, two correlation patterns are noticeable. In the first two years of the pandemic, but not in the third, there was a strong correlation between excess mortality and the number of reported COVID deaths, suggesting that the differences in excess mortality observed earlier in the pandemic are due to differences in the levels of exposure to COVID-19. However, this cannot explain the increase of excess mortality in the second and third pandemic years because the number of COVID-19 deaths decreased instead of increased in almost all federal states. 

Regarding the increase in excess mortality, an increasingly strong positive correlation with the vaccination rate of a federal state is observed, which reaches a value of r = 0.85 in the third pandemic year, indicating that excess mortality increased the stronger the higher the vaccination rate in a federal state was.  **An analysis of stillbirths showed exactly the same pattern** . No other systematic correlation pattern was observed. 

Conclusions: Excess mortality during the pandemic varied substantially between federal states, a finding that requires explanation. While the positive correlation of excess mortality with COVID-19 infections and deaths in the the phase of the pandemic without vaccinations suggests an explanation through different levels of exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 cannot explain the increase in excess mortality after vaccinations began. For the second and third pandemic year a significant positive correlation between the increase of excess mortality and COVID-19 vaccinations is observed, a fact that strongly calls for further investigations on possible negative effects of COVID-19 vaccinations.

#### Excess deaths may be due to down-regulation of immune systm by repeated Vaccinations - March 2023

 **IgG4 Antibodies Induced by mRNA Vaccines Generate Immune Tolerance to SARS-CoV-2’spike Protein by Suppressing the Immune System** 

Preprints.org 2023, 2023030441. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202303.0441.v1. 

Vladimir N. Uversky * ORCID logo , Elrashdy M. Redwan , William Makis , Alberto Rubio-Casillas * ORCID logo

Version 1 : Received: 25 March 2023 / Approved: 27 March 2023 / Online: 27 March 2023 (03:56:26 CEST)

Due to the health crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2, the creation of a new vaccine platform based on mRNA was implemented. Globally, around 13.32 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses of diverse platforms have been given, and up to this date, 69.7% of the total population received at least one injection of a COVID-19 vaccine. Although these vaccines prevent hospitalization and severe forms of the disease, increasing evidence has shown they do not produce sterilizing immunity, allowing people to suffer frequent re-infections. 

 **Recent research has also raised concerns that mRNA vaccines could induce immune tolerance, which, added to that caused by the virus itself, could complicate the clinical course of a COVID-19 infection.**  Furthermore, recent investigations have found high IgG4 levels in people who were administered two or more injections of mRNA vaccines. It has been suggested that an increase in IgG4 levels could have a protecting role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to that occurring during successful allergen-specific immunotherapy by inhibiting IgE-induced effects. 

Altogether, evidence suggests that the reported increase in the IgG4 levels detected after repeated vaccination with the mRNA vaccines is not a protective mechanism; rather, it may be a part of the immune tolerance mechanism to the spike protein that could promote unopposed SARS-CoV2 infection and replication by suppressing natural antiviral responses.  **IgG4-induced suppression of the immune system due to repeated vaccination can also cause autoimmune diseases, promotes cancer growth, and autoimmune myocarditis in susceptible individuals.**

   * "Edward Dowd, a former Wall Street analyst and BlackRock portfolio manager, examines the epidemic of sudden deaths in America. Throughout his stock picking career, he utilized pattern recognition to get ahead of his peers and the street before his bullish or bearish thesis became consensus. Early in 2021, he noticed a rise of news anecdotes about sudden deaths among very fit athletes and other seemingly healthy young people across the country. His thesis was simple: What changed in 2021? . . . A mass vaccination campaign for Covid-19 was his conclusion. Over the course of 2021 and 2022, Edward amassed evidence from the insurance industry, funeral home industry, and government databases that excessive deaths among working-age Americans have increased in 2021 versus 2020 when vaccines were not available. This book will introduce you to some of the tragic stories that have occurred the last eighteen months and lay out the metadata to show readers that something profound changed in 2021 to cause the sudden rash of young deaths with Cause Unknown!

#### How a Zambian morgue is exposing the real covid toll in Africa - April 2022

 **[Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/08/1049107/real-covid-toll-africa-morgue/?truid=e37d32694f4c44a5bda4fa26573c9726&utm_source=the_download&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&utm_term=Active%20Qualified&utm_content=04-08-2022&mc_cid=f7b433a2cf&mc_eid=ebe914c6fe)** 

* "Between January and June of 2021, the researchers found that 32% of the dead in the morgue tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The numbers testing positive rose to 82% during one week of Zambia’s deadliest wave in June. Most had died at home without seeking treatment, and fewer than 10% had tested positive while living—a criterion health authorities required to count them as part of the official covid-19 toll."

* "But roughly 80% of the bodies (cadavers) testing positive were people who had died at home, and almost none of those had received an official covid-19 diagnosis. "
