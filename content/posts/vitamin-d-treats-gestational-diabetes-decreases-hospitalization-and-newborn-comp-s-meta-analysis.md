OBJECTIVE:

This Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial( RCT) was conducted to summarize the preventive and therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation on gestational diabetes mellitus( GDM).

METHODS:

The electronic database( CNKI, CBM, VIP, PubMed, Cochrane library, Web of Science) were systematically searched from inception to February 2018, using the keywords vitamin D and gestational diabetes to identify Meta-analysis.

RESULTS:

A total of 16 RCTs were included. A total of 6 RCTs were included for the prevention of GDM by vitamin D supplementation. Meta-analysis indicated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the level of fasting plasma glucose( FPG)( SMD =-1. 87, 95% CI-3. 39- 0. 35) and the incidence of GDM( OR = 0. 42, 95% CI 0. 30-0. 60) in pregnant women. Ten RCTs were included for the treatment of GDM by vitamin D supplementation. Meta-analysis indicated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the level of fasting plasma glucose( FPG)( SMD =-0. 29, 95% CI-0. 56- 0. 02) and Fasting Insulin( FINS)( SMD =-0. 42, 95% CI-0. 69- 0. 15), also improved the homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance( HOMA-IR)( SMD =-0. 53, 95% CI-0. 89--0. 17) and the homeostasis model of assessment-estimated B cell function( HOMA-Î²)( SMD =-0. 39, 95% CI-0. 61--0. 18), and increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index( QUICKI)( SMD = 0. 87, 95% CI 0. 41-1. 32) in GDM patients.

CONCLUSION:

supplementation may prevent and treat GDM by an improvement in HOMA-IR, HOMA-IR and QUICKI.
