* &quot;a child following the vaccine schedule today has 75% probability of being harmed to a degree or another, or  **7 times more than a child born in the late 70s.** &quot; - page 326

* &quot;Of the 670 million people estimated to have been injured in the past three years worldwide, the most populous group will be formed by people suffering from micro-perforation of blood vessels with a variety of clinical manifestations&quot; page 398

   * Book discusses many ways to decrease the risk of hitting a vein and Hyperbaric Oxygen as a way to recover from vaccines in a vein

*  **Book does not mention that Vitamin D can** 

   * Reduce the risk of vaccine in the vein

   * Reduce the need for many vaccinations
