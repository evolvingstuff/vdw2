Background Stillbirth has been associated with low plasma vitamin D. Both Sweden and Finland have a high propor­tion of low plasma vitamin D levels (< 50 nmol/L). We aimed to assess the odds of stillbirth in relation to changes in national vitamin D fortification.

Methods We surveyed all pregnancies in Finland between 1994 and 2021 (n = 1,569,739) and Sweden (n = 2,800,730) with live or stillbirth registered in the Medical Birth Registries. The mean incidences before and after changes in the vitamin D food fortification programs in Finland (2003 and 2009) and Sweden (2018) were compared with cross-tabu­lation with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results In Finland, the stillbirth rate declined from ~4.1/1000 prior to 2003, to 3.4/1000 between 2004 and 2009 (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and to 2.8/1000 after 2010 (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78-0.91). In Sweden, the still­birth rate decreased from 3.9/1000 between 2008 and 2017 to 3.2/1000 after 2018 (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89). When the level of the dose-dependent difference in Finland in a large sample with correct temporal associations decreased, it remained steady in Sweden, and vice versa, indicating that the effect may be due to vitamin D. These are observa­tional findings that may not be causal.

Conclusion Each increment of vitamin D fortification was associated with a 15% drop in stillbirths on a national level. If true, and if fortification reaches the entire population, it may represent a milestone in preventing stillbirths and reducing health inequalities.

 **The conclusion comments that they had a huge decrease in stillbirths when pregnant women stopped smoking. Also mentioned an increase in stillbirths as pregnant women are becoming more overweight.  Note: Both [smoking](/posts/smoking-reduces-vitamin-d-many-studies) and [obesity](/posts/overview-obesity-and-vitamin-d) decrease levels of Vitamin D**

#### Study on the clinical value of Vitamin D in recurrent spontaneous abortion: Revisiting the Importance of Vitamin D - Jan 2024

Am J Reprod Immunol . 2024 Jan;91(1):e13810. [doi: 10.1111/aji.13810.](https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13810.)

Objective: This study explores the possible pathogenesis of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) caused by vitamin D (VD), provides evidence-based bases for prevention and treatment of RSA, improves female reproductive health.

Methods: This study randomly selected 305 patients without spontaneous abortion (SA0), 216 patients with a spontaneous abortion (SA1) and 200 patients with RSA from 1421 women of childbearing age who visited the RSA specialty clinic of Hangzhou First People's Hospital from January 2021 to June 2023 to conduct a prospective clinical study. Then, we collected the data of clinical diagnosis and treatment, conducted intervention and follow-up, and finally executed statistical analysis.

Results: 

* (1) RSA patients were significantly older than the other two groups. 

* (2) The rates of VD deficiency in SA1 and RSA patients were significantly higher than those in SA0. 

* (3) When BMI < 20 or > 24 kg/m2 , there were abnormal increase in VD and increased number of spontaneous abortions. 

* (4) The bilateral S/D of the VD-sufficient, VD-insufficient and VD-deficient groups gradually increased with statistical significance (p ≤ .018). 

* (5) Among the 65 cases undergoing embryo chromosome examinations, chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 55.38% and 69.05% in RSA patients. 

* (6) Among 186 patients with abnormal ACA, there was a certain negative correlation between ACA and VD, which was stronger among RSA patients. 

Moreover, ACA significantly decreased (p < .001) after effectively supplementing VD, and the miscarriage rate of re-pregnancy also decreased.

Conclusion: The rate of VD deficiency is higher in RSA patients. VD deficiency may be related to the age of women of childbearing age and too low or high BMI, and may cause abnormal plasma antiphospholipid antibodies, increased uterine artery resistance and abnormal chromosomal division during fertilization, leading to spontaneous abortion and even RSA. The improvement of VD deficiency may reduce the risk of RSA occurrence.
