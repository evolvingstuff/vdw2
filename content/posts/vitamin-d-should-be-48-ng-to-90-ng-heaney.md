# Assessing Vitamin D Status

Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care. 2011 Sep;14(5):440-4.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To characterize methods evaluating and to summarize studies linking various serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations with health status.

RECENT FINDINGS: Elucidation of the cell-biologic mechanism of vitamin D action, and numerous clinical trials and observational studies relating vitamin D status to health and disease.

CONCLUSION: The distinction between deficiency and insufficiency is not useful or necessary. 

Serum 25(OH)D values below 120?nmol/l ( **48?ng/ml** ) are associated with preventable disease and are therefore indicative of deficiency. 

The upper limit of the normal range can be set at 225?nmol/l  **(90?ng/ml** ), although toxicity is rare below 500?nmol/l (200?ng/ml).
