+Theranos tests are low cost – always 50 percent of Medicare reimbursement rates or less – and are reimbursed by major insurance carriers, Medicare, and Medicaid.
*Walgreens  has 8,100 neighborhood pharmacies,
*Walgreens for in-store sample-collection centers
*Theranos's technology eliminates multiple lab trips because it can "run any combination of tests, including sets of follow-on tests," at once, very quickly, all from a single microsample
*The company's X-ray of self-transparency also includes reporting its margins-of-error variations online and on test results and order forms, which few if any labs do now
