#### Role of vitamin D on gut microbiota in cystic fibrosis

Pages 82-87

Mansi Kanhere, Benoit Chassaing, Andrew T. Gewirtz, Vin Tangpricha

 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the gut epithelium.

* The mechanism underlying this association involves the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and inhibition of inflammation-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by vitamin D.

* Intestinal dysbiosis is prevalent in CF owing to multiple factors including malabsorption of nutrients and recurrent antibiotics.

* VDR regulates the composition and functions of the gut microbiota and decreased expression of intestinal epithelial VDR disrupts microbial homeostasis.

* Vitamin D could be a potential treatment option for altering dysbiosis in CF, but additional trials are needed to evaluate this.
