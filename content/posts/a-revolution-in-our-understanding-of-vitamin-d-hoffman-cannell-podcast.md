* The “elephant in the room”: skeptics have lately pushed back on the efficacy of vitamin D and impugned the motives of top vitamin D researcher Michael Holick MD. Sounds “too good to be true”—-how could vitamin D be so beneficial for such a myriad of conditions? 

* What are the autoimmune benefits of vitamin D? 

* What are the latest findings linking low D levels to breast cancer risk?

* Is oral vitamin D supplementation equivalent to getting it the natural way—via the sun? 

* What are optimal levels of D? Why is it that individuals require such different levels of supplementation? 

* What about D in pregnancy? 

* For athletic performance? For fending off colds and flus?

* For diabetes? 

* For autism? 

* Are certain formulations of D superior to others?
