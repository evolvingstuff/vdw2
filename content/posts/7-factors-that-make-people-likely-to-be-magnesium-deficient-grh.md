#### 7 factors from [video](https://youtu.be/n1i_kceDSis?si=AkjvoYna7xk9OPVg)

 **1. Dietary factors** 

* people who don’t eat enough magnesium rich foods

* foods previously high in magnesium are no longer rich in magnesium due to farming or processing

* high intake of saturated fats can cause decreased absorption of magnesium in the intestines

* high sugar intake can cause an excessive amount of magnesium to be excreted by the kidneys, leads to less magnesium retention in the body

* carbonated drinks (especially those with phosphorus) can reduce the absorption of magnesium

 **2. Age – Older adults are at higher risk** 

* less magnesium absorption in the gut with age

* increased excretion of magnesium in the urine with age

* a higher likelihood of chronic diseases with age also increases the chance of taking a medication that can interfere with magnesium absorption and utilization (see below)

 **3. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes** 

higher concentrations of sugar in the blood increase excretion of magnesium in urine

 **4. Those taking certain medications** 

stomach acid reducers (such as Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, Pepcid, Tums)

 **5. People with excessive or uncontrolled stress** 

stress hormones eat up magnesium and can deplete magnesium stores

stress affects absorption in the gut, leading to less magnesium being absorbed

 **6. Alcohol dependence** 

alcohol interferes with magnesium absorption

increased alcohol consumption often leads to consuming less nutritious, magnesium rich foods

 **7. Gastrointestinal diseases** 

Malabsorption due to gastrointestinal disorders, such as Chrohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, Whipple’s disease, and others involving chronic diarrhea, can also cause decreased absorption and lead to deficiency
