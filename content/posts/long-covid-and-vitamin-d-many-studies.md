#### Recommend: Supplement with Vitamin D if have Long-COVID

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

* COVID will often create low cellular Vitamin D, but not necessarily low blood Vitamin D

* Often Vitamin D supplementation will treat a health problem ( [there are >200](/posts/health-problems-and-d) ) related to low vitamin D

* For a great many Vitamin D-related health problems it is best to restore levels so as to minimize creating other problems

* Vitamin D [loading doses](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) has been safely and effectively used over 1 million times

   * There are > 200 loading dose protocols - many take 300,000 IU total for a period of 1 day to 1 month

* <a href="/posts/50000-iu-weekly" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 5217">50,000 IU weekly</a> is a very popular dosing schedule which does not use a loading dose

   * Must continue with maintenance dosing after restoration (by 50K weekly or loading dose)

   * - <a href="/posts/50000-iu-once-every-week-or-two" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 5217">50,000 IU once every week or two</a> is popular
