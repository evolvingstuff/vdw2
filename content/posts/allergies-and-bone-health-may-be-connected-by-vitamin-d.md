OBJECTIVE:

To examine the relationships between allergy and bone metabolism as represented by the effects of antihistamines and leukotriene modifiers on bone resorption and formation.

DATA SOURCES:

The major databases MEDLINE and Scopus were searched using the keywords bone metabolism, bone resorption, bone formation, antihistamines, h1 antagonist, leukotriene antagonist, and leukotriene modifier.

STUDY SELECTION:

The studies were independently evaluated by all the coauthors, who judged their pertinence to this review.

RESULTS:

Two of the most intriguing aspects in the field are the possible effects of leukotriene modifiers on fracture repair and the hypothesized role of antihistamines in contrasting osteoporosis. Another rapidly expanding field of research is that related to the immune-modulating effects of  **vitamin D**  because serum levels of vitamin D have been shown to correlate with pulmonary function, asthma onset, and the development of allergic diseases.

CONCLUSION:

Although unexpected, data are now available suggesting a  **strict connection among allergy, its treatments, and bone metabolism.**
