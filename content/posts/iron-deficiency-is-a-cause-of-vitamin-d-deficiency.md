#### IRON Summary

* Human body needs Iron, especially the liver, which also processes Vitamin D

* Primary Iron sources: meat ,supplements, plants (if vitamin C also in the meal)

* Iron deficiency is very common around the world

> especially. pregnant, dark skin, vegans, living in developing countries

* Low-cost Iron supplements cause mild nausea in some people

> there are several high-cost Iron supplements which have much less nausea

* Iron and Vitamin D are synergistic 

> increasing one often increases the other

> low levels of one associated with low levels of the other

> the synergism occurs even without clinical deficiency of either one

* Women who are not menstruating (oral contraceptives or age) have more Iron and more vitamin D

* Iron is depleted by a wide variety of drugs, Calcium, Magnesium, Coffee, Tea, etc.

 **Note also** 

* Vitamin D non-responding infants become responders after Iron supplementation

* This page had just been a Hypothesis before June 2016

---

#### Heme iron polypeptide (HIP) - appears to be the best form

* is a form of heme iron, like in hemoglobin, which is better tolerated than metallic iron

* far fewer side effects

* does not appear to be affected by calcium, coffee, or other foods, and can be taken with meals.

* [Clinical studies of hip: An oral heme-iron product](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531700002153) RCT 2010

   * 3 hours after ingestion, the Iron levels were 23X higher than for ferrous fumarate

   * Suspect that the total bioavailability over say one day is less than that

#### Bidirectional Relationship Between Iron and Vitamin D - Perplexity AI April 2025

 **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/the-bidirectional-relationship-between-iron-and-vi.pdf">Report</a>** 

* "The activation of vitamin D requires two hydroxylation steps, both performed by cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidases (CYPs). These enzymes are iron-dependent, requiring heme as a cofactor for their function."

* "Vitamin D and iron deficiency are two of the most common nutrient deficiencies worldwide. Approximately 23% and 52% of children living in Africa are estimated to have vitamin D and iron deficiency, respectively. Studies have found that these deficiencies frequently coexist, suggesting common risk factors or potential interactions between the nutrients."

* "Understanding the relationship between iron and vitamin D suggests that addressing both deficiencies may be more effective than targeting either in isolation"

   * Elsewhere: newborns who did not respond to Vitamin d supplementation did so after getting Iron supplementation

#### Vegetarians and vegans have less vitamin D in blood: Less Iron?

 **Plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians and vegans: results from the EPIC-Oxford study.** 

* [Vegan vitamin D levels are only 22 ng – Feb 2011](/posts/vegan-vitamin-d-levels-are-only-22-ng) in VitaminDWiki, along with PDF of the study

> The study accounted for  the vitamin D from meat, fish, and vegetables

 **Comment by VitaminDWiki** 

Strongly suspect the reason for the results found is: 

Vegetarian/Vegan ==> Decreased Iron ==> Decreased Liver ability to process vitamin D

* Meat: 124 IU daily ==>31 ng

* V/V:      28 IU daily ==>22 ng

That is: increase of 100 IU ==> increase of 10 ng

But, other studies show that need 400 IU to 800 IU ==> 10ng

* [Overview Vitamin D Dose-Response](/posts/overview-vitamin-d-dose-response) which shows about 800 IU needed to raise blood level by 10ng

* [Every 400 IU increase of vitamin D3 increases serum level about 8 ng– Systematic Review Aug 2012](/posts/every-400-iu-increase-of-vitamin-d3-increases-serum-level-about-8-ng-systematic-review)

##### Options for Vegetarians/Vegans include:

1. Supplement with Iron (such as with the patented Iron supplement at the bottom of this page)

1. Eat vegetables along  with vitamin C - which increases the amount of Iron available from plants.

1. Supplement with vitamin D3 (<a href="/posts/three-companies-sell-vegan-d3" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2136">Three companies sell Vegan D3</a>)

1. Spend more time in the sun or with a UV lamp

 **There are MANY medical drugs that deplete Iron from the body. Some of the categories are:** 

> Antacids: such as those used to reduce stomach acidity, GERD, etc.

> Antibiotics: cephalosporins, penicillins, tetracyclines, etc.

> Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: ibuprofen, steroids, etc.

> Blood Pressure Lowering Drugs: calcium-channel blockers, ACE-Inhibitors, and others.

> Diuretics: "water pills", > And the list goes on...

 **Some of the commonly-used natural supplements that deplete Iron by binding to it either in the blood or digestive tract:** 

> Calcium, > Magnesium, > Artichoke, > Cascara sagrada, > Chamomile, > CoQ10, > And the list goes on...
