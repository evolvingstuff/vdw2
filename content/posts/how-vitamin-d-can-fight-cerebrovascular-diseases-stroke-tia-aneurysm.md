Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to several major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer, linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging. Vitamin D deficiency appears to be particularly harmful to the cardiovascular system, as it can cause endothelial dysfunctioning and vascular abnormalities through the modulation of various downstream mechanisms. As a result, new research indicates that therapeutic approaches targeting vitamin D inadequacies or its significant downstream effects, such as impaired autophagy, abnormal pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant reactions, may delay the onset and severity of major cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and neurologic malformations. Vitamin D modulates the various molecular pathways, i.e., Nitric Oxide, PI3K-Akt Pathway, cAMP pathway, NF-kB Pathway, Sirtuin 1, Nrf2, FOXO, in cerebrovascular disorder. The current review shows evidence for vitamin Dâ€™s mitigating or slowing the progression of these cerebrovascular disorders, which are significant causes of disability and death worldwide.
