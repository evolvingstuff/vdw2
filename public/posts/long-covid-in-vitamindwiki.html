This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1st of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. A total of <strong>18,251 publications</strong> were identified, of which <strong>15 met the inclusion criteria</strong> .</p><p>The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 15 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years.</p><p>It was estimated that <strong>80%</strong> (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed <strong>one or more long-term symptoms</strong> .</p><p>The five most common symptoms were</p><ul><li><p>fatigue (58%),</p></li><li><p>headache (44%),</p></li><li><p>attention disorder (27%),</p></li><li><p>hair loss (25%), and</p></li><li><p>dyspnea (24%). <span>[difficult or labored breathing]</span></p></li></ul><p>All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13).
