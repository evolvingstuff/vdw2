&lt;p>The objective of this study was to identify the effect of high alpine grazing, associated with varying pasture grass qualities and more pronounced exercise on typically steep slopes, on bone metabolism by improving bone density and enhancing bone turnover in growing sheep. Twenty-four 5-month-old sheep were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was kept at high altitude (HA; 2000-2200 m a.s.l.) for 3 months, and the other group (C; control) remained in the lowlands (400 m a.s.l.). Both groups were kept in grazing pastures with access to good-quality swards. Before the start of the experiment, blood samples were taken, the sheep were weighed, and the left metatarsus of each animal was analysed by quantitative computer tomography. After 1 month, blood samples were taken and body weight was measured, followed by biweekly sampling. Finally, the animals were slaughtered, and the bones were collected for analysis of various bone parameters. Body weight development did not differ between the groups. Concentrations of 25-OH-Vitamin D, carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen and activities of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were always higher in the HA group than in the C group, except on the last two sampling dates. Bone mineral content and density increased in both groups during the experiment, but more intensively in the HA group. In addition, the cortical thickness of the HA group increased. The present study demonstrates an increase in bone turnover and mineral content of the bones of the growing sheep grazing in high alpine pastures. The factors associated with HA grazing, therefore, clearly seem to improve bone composition.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Invertebrates use Vitamin D3 as well</title><link>/posts/invertebrates-use-vitamin-d3-as-well.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/invertebrates-use-vitamin-d3-as-well.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="results-of-a-pubmed-search-by-dr-grant-april-2013">Results of a PubMed search by Dr. Grant, April 2013&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Rickets and osteomalacia are increasing in prevalence in people because of cultural practices, breast-feeding, decreased sun exposure, and increased sunscreen usage. Several hereditary forms of rickets owing to either renal phosphate wasting or defects in vitamin D metabolism are also reported in people. Rickets is well recognized in domestic animals, but published reports are not always supported by microscopic findings, and diagnoses based on clinical signs and radiology are unreliable. Most cases in domestic animals are caused by dietary deficiency of either vitamin D or phosphorus, but occasional inherited forms are reported in pigs, sheep, cats, and dogs. There is variation between species in susceptibility to dietary vitamin D and phosphorus deficiency and in the ability to manufacture vitamin D in their skin. A number of mouse models have been discovered or created to study human skeletal diseases and skeletal homeostasis. With the discovery that vitamin D is involved in not only calcium and phosphorus homeostasis but also in the immune system and cancer, there is great potential for new and existing animal models to generate valuable information about vitamin D and its many functions. This review presents an overview of vitamin D metabolism and rickets in domestic and laboratory animals and makes comparisons where appropriate with the disease in humans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tiger got surgery for hip arthritis – not much sun in the cage</title><link>/posts/tiger-got-surgery-for-hip-arthritis-not-much-sun-in-the-cage.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/tiger-got-surgery-for-hip-arthritis-not-much-sun-in-the-cage.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Piglets getting single dose of 40,000 IU of vitamin D gained more weight</title><link>/posts/piglets-getting-single-dose-of-40000-iu-of-vitamin-d-gained-more-weight.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/piglets-getting-single-dose-of-40000-iu-of-vitamin-d-gained-more-weight.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="effect-of-oral-vitamin-d3-supplementation-on-growth-and-serum-25-hydroxy-vitamin-d-levels-of-pigs-up-to-7-weeks-of-age">Effect of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on growth and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels of pigs up to 7 weeks of age&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Feedlot producers often exceed NRC recommendations for vitamin A and D supplementation; however, increased concentrations of these vitamins have been shown to limit adipocyte differentiation in vitro. A feedlot trial was conducted using 168 Angus crossbred steers (BW = 284 ± 0.4 kg) allotted to 24 pens. The experiment had a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments: no supplemental vitamin A or D (NAND), 3,750 IU vitamin A/kg dietary DM with no supplemental vitamin D (SAND), no supplemental vitamin A and 1,860 IU vitamin D/kg dietary DM (NASD), and 3,750 IU and 1,860 IU vitamin A and D/ kg dietary DM (SASD), respectively. Serum, liver, and intramuscular and subcutaneous adipose tissue retinol concentrations were decreased in (P &amp;lt; 0.001) in cattle fed the no supplemental vitamin A diets (NAND and NASD combined) compared with those consuming supplemental vitamin A (SAND and SASD combined) diets. In addition, intramuscular retinol concentration was 38% less than in the subcutaneous depot. Serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations were reduced (P &amp;lt; 0.001) during the first 70 d when cattle were fed no supplemental vitamin D diets (NAND and SAND combined); however, liver 25(OH)D3 concentrations remained unchanged (P &amp;gt; 0.10) through d 184. Serum and liver 25(OH)D3 concentrations increased (P &amp;lt; 0.001) with vitamin D supplementation (NASD and SASD combined). The DMI, ADG, G:F, and morbidity were not affected (P &amp;gt; 0.10) by dietary concentration of vitamin A or D. There were vitamin A and D interactions (P &amp;lt; 0.03) for backfat thickness and USDA Yield grade. Cattle fed the NAND diet had greater (P &amp;lt; 0.03) Yield grades than other treatments because of greater (P &amp;lt; 0.005) 12th rib backfat thickness in NAND steers than the NASD and SAND steers. Vitamin D concentrations were attenuated and minimal carcass adiposity responses to vitamin D supplementation were observed. Feeding a diet without supplemental vitamin A increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) Quality grades and marbling scores and tended (P = 0.06) to increase ether extractable lipid of the LM. As retinol and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in feedlot cattle declined as a result of a lack of dietary supplementation, adipose accretion increased, resulting in elevated Quality and Yield grades. Withdrawal of supplemental vitamin A, D, or both from the finishing diet of feedlot beef cattle had minimal impact carcass composition.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Senior pets rejuvenated with vitamin D</title><link>/posts/senior-pets-rejuvenated-with-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/senior-pets-rejuvenated-with-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="many-stories-of-people-helping-their-aging-dogs-cats-and-other-pets-with-vitamin-d">Many stories of people helping their aging dogs, cats and other pets with Vitamin D&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In vitro studies with skin samples or pure precursors of cholecalciferol indicated that cholecalciferol synthesis during UV light exposure is a non-linear process. However, in vitro studies indicate nothing about the relationship between sunlight exposure and physiological cholecalciferol status of living organisms. Due to the lack of cholecalciferol in plant material, this relationship is important for herbivores including domestic cattle, particularly in organic agriculture, because the use of synthetic additives, like cholecalciferol, is restricted in order to fulfil the principles of sustainable organic production. The major physiological metabolite of cholecalciferol is the liver-derived 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3). The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between sunlight exposure and 25(OH)D3 status in vivo in large herbivores during mid-summer at 56°N.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>200 IU per 100 gram of egg yoke when add vitamin D to poultry feed in Europe</title><link>/posts/200-iu-per-100-gram-of-egg-yoke-when-add-vitamin-d-to-poultry-feed-in-europe.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/200-iu-per-100-gram-of-egg-yoke-when-add-vitamin-d-to-poultry-feed-in-europe.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-different-vitamin-d-supplementations-in-poultry-feed-on-vitamin-d-content-of-eggs-and-chicken-meat">Effect of different vitamin D supplementations in poultry feed on vitamin D content of eggs and chicken meat.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The objective of this study was to identify the effect of high alpine grazing, associated with varying pasture grass qualities and more pronounced exercise on typically steep slopes, on bone metabolism by improving bone density and enhancing bone turnover in growing sheep. Twenty-four 5-month-old sheep were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was kept at high altitude (HA; 2000-2200?m a.s.l.) for 3?months, and the other group (C; control) remained in the lowlands (400?m a.s.l.). Both groups were kept in grazing pastures with access to good-quality swards. Before the start of the experiment, blood samples were taken, the sheep were weighed, and the left metatarsus of each animal was analysed by quantitative computer tomography. &lt;strong>After 1?month&lt;/strong> , blood samples were taken and body weight was measured, followed by biweekly sampling. Finally, the animals were slaughtered, and the bones were collected for analysis of various bone parameters. Body weight development did not differ between the groups.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cattle need 66 IU of vitamin D per pound</title><link>/posts/cattle-need-66-iu-of-vitamin-d-per-pound.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cattle-need-66-iu-of-vitamin-d-per-pound.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="from-nutrient-requirements-of-dairy-cattle-seventh--2001">From Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle: Seventh — 2001&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is a pro-hormone, a necessary precursor for the production of the calcium regulating hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D can be produced within the skin of most mammals, including cattle, as a result of the photochemical conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3. In plants, ultraviolet irradiation causes photochemical conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D2. Vitamin D, supplied by the skin or the diet, is rapidly transported to and sequestered by the liver. The rapid removal of vitamin D from circulation prevents concentrations of vitamin D in blood from becoming very high; the normal concentration is 1 to 2 ng vitamin D/ml plasma (Horst and Littledike, 1982). Within the liver, vitamin D can be converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D by vitamin D 25-hydrox-ylase and released into the blood. The production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D within the liver is dependent on the vitamin D content of the diet. Thus plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration is the best indicator of vitamin D status of an animal (Horst et al., 1994).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Controversy cats and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/controversy-cats-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/controversy-cats-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>For the primate species that have been studied, vitamin D is not an essential component of the diet as long as they have adequate exposure to sunlight (Holick, 1994). But it appears to be essential in the tissues of most primates for maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and for normal bone mineralization (Holick, 1996). In the absence of solar exposure, these primates must be exposed to sources of artificial light of appropriate wavelengths or must receive sufficient vitamin D in the diet. In this review we will try to put into perspective what is known about vitamin D in humans and to compare this information with what is known about its role in nonhuman primates and other vertebrates.!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Health and Light - Ott 1973</title><link>/posts/health-and-light-ott-1973.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/health-and-light-ott-1973.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Health and Light by John N.

&lt;p>“Vitamin D becomes a nutritionally important factor in the &lt;strong>absence of sufficient sunlight.&lt;/strong> ”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“The &lt;strong>colors of the skin&lt;/strong> are important in determining response to irradiation. Irradiation is less effective on dark-pigmented skin. This has been shown to be true for white and black breeds of hogs. White pigs have been shown to resist vitamin D deficiency signs about &lt;strong>twice as long as colored pigs&lt;/strong> ; an average of 45 minutes of daily exposure to January sunshine for two weeks was sufficient to cure rickets in white pigs in Minnesota (Cunha, 1977).”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lambs get 10X more vitamin D3 in their milk formula than humans</title><link>/posts/lambs-get-10x-more-vitamin-d3-in-their-milk-formula-than-humans.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/lambs-get-10x-more-vitamin-d3-in-their-milk-formula-than-humans.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="lambs-and-sheep-royal-instant-lamb-milk-replacer-12000-iu-lbhttpwwwroyalmilcinccomlambs_and_sheephtml">&lt;a href="http://www.royalmilcinc.com/lambs_and_sheep.html">Lambs and Sheep: Royal Instant Lamb Milk Replacer 12,000 IU /lb&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
