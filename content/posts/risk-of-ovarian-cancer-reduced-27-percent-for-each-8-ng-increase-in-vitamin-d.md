The evidence from previous studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and ovarian cancer risk are not conclusive. However, 25(OH)D was generally only measured in late adulthood, which may not capture the etiologically relevant exposure periods. We investigated predicted 25(OH)D over the adult lifetime in relation to ovarian cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted from 2011 to 2016 in Montreal, Canada (490 cases, 896 controls). Predicted 25(OH)D was computed using previously validated regression models. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for average predicted 25(OH)D over the adult life and risk. In addition, the relative importance of different periods of past 25(OH)D exposure was explored using a weighted cumulative exposure (WCE) model. 

For each 20 nmol/L increase in average predicted 25(OH)D over the adult life, the aOR (95% CI) was 0.73 (0.55-0.96). In WCE analyses, the inverse association was strongest for exposures 5 to 20 years and 35 to 55 years prior to diagnosis, with aORs (95% CIs) of 0.82 (0.69-0.94) and 0.79 (0.66-1.02), respectively, for each 20 nmol/L increase in predicted 25(OH)D. These results support an inverse association between 25(OH)D in adulthood and ovarian cancer risk.
