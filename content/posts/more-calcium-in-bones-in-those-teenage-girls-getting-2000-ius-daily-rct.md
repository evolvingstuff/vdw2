We had demonstrated a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on musculoskeletal parameters in adolescent girls in a one-year, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial (RCT). Our objective is to investigate the residual effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), at the lumbar spine and hip, lean mass, and height, one-year post-trial completion.

We performed post-hoc analyses in 167 adolescents, 86 girls and 81 boys, 13.9 ± 2 years, who received vitamin D or placebo during trial, and continued into the follow-up trial. Musculoskeletal parameters were measured at baseline, 12 months (intervention), and 24 months (follow-up). T-tests and ANOVA were used to compare results between the placebo group and the merged vitamin D arms (200 or 2000 IU/day), by gender.

Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups at entry into the extension. Girls who had received vitamin D during the trial, had significantly larger hip BMC increments compared to those assigned to placebo, 24 months compared to study entry, but not 24 compared to 12 months, that persisted in adjusted analyses. There were no significant differences in bone mass changes between treatment groups in boys, at either 24 12 or 24 months compared to baseline.

The beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on hip bone mass, achieved in girls during the trial, persisted one year post-trial completion. These net cumulative increments, one-year post discontinuation of supplementation, may have important implications on optimizing peak bone mass accretion in adolescent girls.
