Among the most common problems facing public health today is a lack of vitamin D, which plays a role in the physiological processes of chronic illness conditions. 

Vitamin D deficiency in metabolic disorders has primary effects on 

* osteoporosis, 

* obesity, 

* hypertension, 

* diabetes, and 

* cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

Vitamin D acts as a “co-hormone” in the various tissues of the body, and it has been found that vitamin D receptors (VDR) are present on all cell types, suggesting that vitamin D has a wide range of effects on most cells. 

Recently, there has been a surge in interest in assessing its roles. Vitamin D insufficiency increases the risk of diabetes because it lowers insulin sensitivity, and also raises the risk of obesity and CVD because of its effect on the body’s lipid profile, particularly in terms of the prevalence of dangerously high levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). 

Furthermore, vitamin D insufficiency is often related to CVD and connected risk factors, highlighting the need to know vitamin D’s functions in relation to metabolic syndrome and related processes. Through looking at previous studies, this paper explains why vitamin D is important, how deficiency is related to risk factors for metabolic syndrome through different mechanisms, and how deficiency affects CVD.
