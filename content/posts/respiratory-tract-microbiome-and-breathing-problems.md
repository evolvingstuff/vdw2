#### Bacteria in Your Lungs? New Microbiome Study Shows How They Get There - Feb 2017

 **[link](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/lab-report/bacteria-your-lungs-new-microbiome-study-shows-how-they-get-there)** 

* “Bacteria in the lungs may play a major role in disease — and health. Researchers have just mapped where the bacteria are and how they arrived, paving the way for more discoveries about the lung microbiome.”

* “… evidence that most of the bacteria in the lungs of healthy people got there by way of microaspiration. In other words, they ride in on tiny droplets of saliva that made it from the microbe-filled mouth to the lungs”

* “Unlike the gut, healthy lungs are an inhospitable environment for bacteria, with little nutrition and constant surveillance by the immune system.”

* “We are probably all aspirating small amounts of bacteria constantly, and so long as our immune system is intact, they rarely make us sick.”

* “He and colleagues have already found evidence that the lungs are filled with gut microbes in critically ill patients.”

#### Understanding Microbiome Effect on Immune Checkpoint Inhibition in Lung Cancer: Placing the Puzzle Pieces Together – May 2018

 **[Link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29781826)** 

Over the past couple of years, human microbiome has received increasing attention as a regulator and predictor of response to the therapies of various diseases. It is speculated that manipulating gut microbiome can modify response to cancer immunotherapies as well. Through this review, we have critically analyzed our current understanding of gut microbiome as a modulator of immunotherapies in lung cancer, explained conflicting data, evaluated current gaps and extrapolated our present knowledge to generate directions for future investigations.

#### The microbiome and the lung.– Aug 2014

Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2014 Aug;11 Suppl 4:S227-32. [doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201402-052PL.](https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201402-052PL.)

Investigation of the human microbiome has become an important field of research facilitated by advances in sequencing technologies. The lung, which is one of the latest body sites being explored for the characterization of human-associated microbial communities, has a microbiome that is suspected to play a substantial role in health and disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the basics of microbiome studies. Challenges in the study of the lung microbiome are highlighted, and further attention is called to the optimization and standardization of methodologies to explore the role of the lung microbiome in health and disease. We also provide examples of lung microbial communities associated with disease or infection status and discuss the role of fungal species in the lung. Finally, we review studies demonstrating that the environmental microbiome can influence lung health and disease, such as the finding that the diversity of microbial exposure correlates inversely with the development of childhood asthma.

#### Lung microbiota – Wikipedia May 2018

 **[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_microbiota)** 

* “The microbial communities are highly variable in particular individuals and compose of about 140 distinct families. The bronchial tree for instance contains a mean of 2000 bacterial genomes per cm2 surface”

* “Changes in microbial community composition seem to play a role in progression of such pulmonary disorders as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and cystic fibrosis”
