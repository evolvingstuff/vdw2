### Calcium and Vitamin D- Created from Consumer Labs Jan 2010 review

 **Note: Often multi-vitamins have even less, only 400 IU - which has only been enough to prevent rickets.** 

 **Need 2000+ IU daily to start to improve your near-term health and make substantial reductions in long-term disease**
