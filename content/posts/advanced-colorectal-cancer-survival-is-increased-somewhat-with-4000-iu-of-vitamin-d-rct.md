 **Would have had far more benefit if they had done one or more of the following** 

1. Started with a Vitamin D[loading dose](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) (e.g. 400,000 IU over a week)

1. Had used a dose size of at least 4,000 IU of vitamin D

1. Had used [less frequent than daily dosing](/posts/optimal-vitamin-d-supplementation-strategies-d3-weekly-or-monthly)

1. Had supplemented to increase the [activation of the vitamin D Receptor](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) - such as Resveratrol

 **Note: Even better if had high vitamin D years before, as Vitamin D PREVENTS colon cancer**
