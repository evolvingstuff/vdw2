#### Ocular haemodynamics in children with vitamin D deficiency

Eye (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-024-03528-w PDF behind a paywall

Bengi Ece Kurtul,  Cansu Sipal & Cigdem El 

Background

To evaluate the retinal and optic nerve head microvasculature in children with vitamin D deficiency using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).

Methods

This prospective, cross-sectional study included 74 eyes of 37 children with vitamin D deficiency (Group I) and 64 eyes of 32 healthy children (Group II). All participants underwent OCTA examinations. Foveal retinal thickness (FRT), peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness, vessel density (VD) in different sections of the retina, and optic disc were analysed and compared between the groups.

Results

The mean ages, gender, mean intraocular pressures, and central corneal thickness levels were similar between the groups. The mean vitamin D levels measured from the venous blood samples of the participants were  **11.42**  ± 4.94 ng/mL in Group I and  **26.03**  ± 11.08 ng/mL in Group II, and the difference between these values was statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference regarding optic disc capillary densities between the groups.

However, compared with the Group II, Group I showed significantly higher values of FRT, and lower values of superficial whole, parafoveal and perifoveal VD (287.58 ± 12.43 mm vs 258.21 ± 22.68, P < 0.001, 50.85 ± 2.15% vs 51.77 ± 2.30%, P = 0.01, 54.05 ± 2.83% vs 55.18 ± 2.40%, P = 0.01, 51.27 ± 2.21% vs 52.11 ± 2.27%, P = 0.03, respectively). The vitamin D levels showed significantly negative correlation with FRT values in Group I (r = −0.439, P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency seems to be associated with higher values of FRT and decreased levels of superficial VD. Retinal microvascular architecture may be affected in paediatric subjects who have vitamin D deficiency.

#### What does a thicker foveal retinal thickness imply: Asked [Perplexity AI - Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-does-a-thicker-foveal-ret-MtPxwSsMQ0mtA4CkDpRSSw)

A thicker foveal retinal thickness can imply several important factors related to eye health and vision:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Myopia Association</span>** 

Increased foveal thickness is associated with higher degrees of myopia. As myopia (nearsightedness) increases, the thickness of the fovea tends to increase &nbsp;[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908854/) &nbsp;[2](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2513984)

This relationship suggests that foveal thickening may be a structural change that occurs as the eye elongates in myopic individuals.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Macular Edema</span>** 

A significantly thickened fovea can be indicative of macular edema, particularly in diabetic patients. Foveal thickness exceeding 180 μm measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) may be useful for the early detection of macular thickening in diabetic eyes  &nbsp;[3](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2123045)

This threshold can serve as an indicator for closer patient monitoring.

 **Normal Variation vs. Pathology** 

It's important to note that there is a range of normal foveal thickness in healthy eyes. Studies using OCT have found that:

* The average foveal thickness in healthy eyes is approximately 212 ± 20 μm

* The central foveal thickness is around 182 ± 23 μm

Foveal thickness exceeding 252 μm may be considered suspicious for macular thickening, while values below 172 μm might suggest macular thinning  &nbsp;[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1941772/)

 **Visual Acuity Correlation** 

Foveal thickness has been shown to correlate with visual acuity. In some studies, greater fluctuations in retinal thickness predicted lower final visual acuity and reduced visual acuity gains  &nbsp;[5](https://journals.lww.com/retinajournal/Fulltext/2021/08000/RETINAL_FLUID_AND_THICKNESS_AS_MEASURES_OF_DISEASE.1.aspx)

This suggests that maintaining stable foveal thickness may be important for preserving visual function.

 **Clinical Implications** 

Understanding foveal thickness is crucial for:

1. Diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases

1. Assessing the efficacy of treatments, particularly anti-VEGF therapies for conditions like age-related macular degeneration

1. Predicting visual outcomes in various retinal pathologies

In clinical practice, changes in foveal thickness are often used alongside other OCT parameters to guide treatment decisions and evaluate disease progression or improvement.

!!!!Ocular haemodynamics in children with vitamin D deficiency
Eye (2024). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-024-03528-w PDF behind a paywall
Bengi Ece Kurtul,  Cansu Sipal &amp; Cigdem El 

Background
To evaluate the retinal and optic nerve head microvasculature in children with vitamin D deficiency using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).

Methods
This prospective, cross-sectional study included 74 eyes of 37 children with vitamin D deficiency (Group I) and 64 eyes of 32 healthy children (Group II). All participants underwent OCTA examinations. Foveal retinal thickness (FRT), peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness, vessel density (VD) in different sections of the retina, and optic disc were analysed and compared between the groups.

Results
The mean ages, gender, mean intraocular pressures, and central corneal thickness levels were similar between the groups. The mean vitamin D levels measured from the venous blood samples of the participants were __11.42__ ± 4.94 ng/mL in Group I and __26.03__ ± 11.08 ng/mL in Group II, and the difference between these values was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference regarding optic disc capillary densities between the groups.
However, compared with the Group II, Group I showed significantly higher values of FRT, and lower values of superficial whole, parafoveal and perifoveal VD (287.58 ± 12.43 mm vs 258.21 ± 22.68, P &lt; 0.001, 50.85 ± 2.15% vs 51.77 ± 2.30%, P = 0.01, 54.05 ± 2.83% vs 55.18 ± 2.40%, P = 0.01, 51.27 ± 2.21% vs 52.11 ± 2.27%, P = 0.03, respectively). The vitamin D levels showed significantly negative correlation with FRT values in Group I (r = −0.439, P = 0.001).

Conclusions
Vitamin D deficiency seems to be associated with higher values of FRT and decreased levels of superficial VD. Retinal microvascular architecture may be affected in paediatric subjects who have vitamin D deficiency.

!!!!What does a thicker foveal retinal thickness imply: Asked [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-does-a-thicker-foveal-ret-MtPxwSsMQ0mtA4CkDpRSSw|Perplexity AI - Dec 2024]
A thicker foveal retinal thickness can imply several important factors related to eye health and vision:
__~~#00F:Myopia Association~~__
Increased foveal thickness is associated with higher degrees of myopia. As myopia (nearsightedness) increases, the thickness of the fovea tends to increase ~hs~[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908854/|1] ~hs~[https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2513984|2]
This relationship suggests that foveal thickening may be a structural change that occurs as the eye elongates in myopic individuals.
__~~#00F:Macular Edema~~__
A significantly thickened fovea can be indicative of macular edema, particularly in diabetic patients. Foveal thickness exceeding 180 μm measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) may be useful for the early detection of macular thickening in diabetic eyes  ~hs~[https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2123045|3]

This threshold can serve as an indicator for closer patient monitoring.
__Normal Variation vs. Pathology__
It&#39;s important to note that there is a range of normal foveal thickness in healthy eyes. Studies using OCT have found that:
*The average foveal thickness in healthy eyes is approximately 212 ± 20 μm
*The central foveal thickness is around 182 ± 23 μm
Foveal thickness exceeding 252 μm may be considered suspicious for macular thickening, while values below 172 μm might suggest macular thinning  ~hs~[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1941772/|4]
__Visual Acuity Correlation__
Foveal thickness has been shown to correlate with visual acuity. In some studies, greater fluctuations in retinal thickness predicted lower final visual acuity and reduced visual acuity gains  ~hs~[https://journals.lww.com/retinajournal/Fulltext/2021/08000/RETINAL_FLUID_AND_THICKNESS_AS_MEASURES_OF_DISEASE.1.aspx|5]
This suggests that maintaining stable foveal thickness may be important for preserving visual function.
__Clinical Implications__
Understanding foveal thickness is crucial for:
#Diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases
#Assessing the efficacy of treatments, particularly anti-VEGF therapies for conditions like age-related macular degeneration
#Predicting visual outcomes in various retinal pathologies
In clinical practice, changes in foveal thickness are often used alongside other OCT parameters to guide treatment decisions and evaluate disease progression or improvement.
