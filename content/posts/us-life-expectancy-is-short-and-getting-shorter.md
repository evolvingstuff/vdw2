#### 'Live free and die?' The sad state of U.S. life expectancy - NPR

 **[NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/25/1164819944/live-free-and-die-the-sad-state-of-u-s-life-expectancy?utm_medium=email&utm_source=pocket_hits&utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-RECS-2023_03_27&sponsored=0&position=3&scheduled_corpus_item_id=80c4db78-8d42-4a69-a34c-902765c4521d) &nbsp; [Interactive charts](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/#Life%20expectancy%20at%20birth%20in%20years,%201980-2021)**

* Also:  **Maternal mortality**  in the U.S. [reached a high in 2021](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/16/1163786037/maternal-deaths-in-the-u-s-spiked-in-2021-cdc-reports).

* Also, [a paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2802602) in the Journal of the American Medical Association   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; found  **rising mortality rates among U.S. children and adolescents.** 

* "American  **children are less likely to live to age 5**  than children in other high-income countries," the authors write on the second page. It goes on: "Even Americans with healthy behaviors, 

   * for example, those who are not obese or do not smoke, appear to have higher disease rates than their peers in other countries."

* ""If you add up the excess deaths that have occurred in the United States because of this unfolding problem, it dwarfs what happened during COVID-19,..."

* However, "the United States has higher survival after age 75 than do peer countries,..."

 **Reminder: in the US Big Pharma just has to show that a new drug is better than a placebo.   
In many other countries a new drug must be more cost-effective than the existing drug.**
