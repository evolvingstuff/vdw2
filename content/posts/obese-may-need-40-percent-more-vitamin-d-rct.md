Objective: Prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy is high in obese individuals. Determining the response of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> to vitamin D3 supplementation in obese and non-obese individuals may lead to concurrent recommendations for optimal vitamin D intake in these populations. The objective of this study was to determine the dose response of vitamin D3 in subjects with body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m2.

Design and Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. This study is an extension of our previous study of vitamin D dosing in healthy adults. After an assessment of baseline 25(OH)D levels, participants were randomized to a vitamin D supplementation arm (100 μg daily if baseline 25(OH)D was < 50 nmol/L, or 50 μg daily if baseline 25(OH)D was ≥ 50 nmol/L) or placebo arm. 

Subjects with baseline 25(OH)D level ≥ 80 nmol/L were excluded from the study. Two months following randomization, a repeat 25(OH)D measurement was done.

Results: Final analysis included 25 subjects (14 placebo, 11 active). At two months, serum 25(OH)D concentration increased to a mean of 75 nmol/L in the active group. Mean slope (i.e. vitamin D3 response), defined as 25(OH)D change/baseline dose, was 0.398 nmol/L/μg/d.

Conclusion: The dose response of vitamin D3 (slope) in obese subjects was significantly lower (p < 0.03) at 0.398 nmol/L/μg/d compared to the slope in the previous study of healthy subjects (0.66 nmol/L/μg/d). These results suggest that obese individuals may require 40% higher vitamin D intake than non-obese individuals to attain the same serum 25(OH)D concentration.
