*  **These appear to be the first man-made chemicals which increase the Vitamin D receptor, which in-turn increases the amount of Vitamin D which actually gets to cells.** 

*  **A great many diseases are associated with poor vitamin D receptors** 

*  **You can test the Vitamin D receptor in your mouth as very low cost** 

*  **So far there are 7 known ways to increase the Vitamin D receptor (see below)** 

>  **I am doing 6 of them** 

*  **I do not know if the same chemical can increase Vitamin D Receptors for other than breast cancers** 

*  **I do not know if the same chemical can increase Vitamin D Receptors for other health problems** 

*  **<span style="color:#00F;">I wonder if people with poor vitamin D receptors could have a good or better benefit from using some of the 7 ways to increase VDR, taking more Vitamin D, and reducing Calcium supplementation</span>**
