#### [Press Release: GrassrootsHealth Receives Humanitarian Award from the American College of Nutrition](http://www.prweb.com/releases/vitamind/winsaward/prweb13882995.htm%20)

 **Award recognizes dedication to moving public health messages regarding vitamin D from research into practice.** 

This award is especially deserved given the crisis of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency across America, especially in minority communities, and its profound health impacts.

The American College of Nutrition honored non-profit, GrassrootsHealth, with their Humanitarian Award at their 57th annual conference held in San Diego November 9 - 11. This award is presented to individuals or organizations who have worked selflessly and effectively in the broader field of nutrition to benefit humanity. Past recipients include UNICEF, David Perlmutter (author of Grain Brain), and Vitamin Angels.

The Humanitarian Award was presented to GrassrootsHealth to honor their tireless efforts to move vitamin D research into practice. Without the work of GrassrootsHealth it might take another generation to bring this low-cost, safe, nutritional need to light. In addition to working with over 10,000 individuals in their D*action program to test vitamin D levels, GrassrootsHealth is also teaming up with hospitals and cancer centers across the country to make optimizing vitamin D levels a standard of care.

“This award is especially deserved given the crisis of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency across America, especially in minority communities, and its profound health impacts,” states Michael Stroka, Executive Director of the American College of Nutrition. “We are grateful to Carole for her team’s work on behalf of human health, and are pleased to be able to recognize and contribute to their work in this way.”

The Humanitarian Award comes with a monetary donation derived from proceeds of the exhibit hall. This year, the donation that accompanied the award was  **$28,000** . GrassrootsHealth will use the funds to further their work of moving vitamin D research into practice – helping to expand their public reach and education.

“I share this award with the 48 vitamin D scientists and researchers who share a common goal and have worked countless hours to this end,” stated Carole Baggerly, Founder and Director of GrassrootsHealth. “Together, we have the methodology to implement the call to action – to get the WORLD to the recommended 40-60 ng/ml (100-150 nmol/L). Participating medical institutions are realizing both health benefits and cost savings in their practice by optimizing vitamin D levels. These institutions either participate in our pregnancy project, Protect our Children NOW! or our new Cancer Prevention project.”
