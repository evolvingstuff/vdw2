 **[Biovista is doing the investigation](https://www.biovista.com/solutions/project-prodigy-vs-covid-19/)** 

 **Project Prodigy AI at Biovista is focused on potential COVID-19 treatments** 

* "... create visual networks of connections between different attack points related to COVID-19, including drugs, genes, pathways, cell types and more"

* " **Project Prodigy**  is working through more than 170,000 putative Drugs, Compounds and Nutritional Supplements, DIRECTLY or INDIRECTLY linked to the COVID-19 targets..."

* They then are:

   * exploring the biology around the disease

   * generating hypotheses for possible treatment

   * sharing hypotheses with the community

   * assessing and refining these hypotheses

* "Supporting scientific literature (PubMed articles) can be viewed by clicking on the <span style="color:#00F;">blue document icons.</span>"

* So far, we hypothesize that two (2) drugs and (2) Nutritional Supplements that could be co-administered with the drugs seem to be suitable for further study and testing
