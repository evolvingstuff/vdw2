#### Vitamin D and the skin: Physiology and pathophysiology

The keratinocytes of the skin are unique in being not only the primary source of vitamin D for the body, but in possessing both the enzymatic machinery to metabolize the vitamin D produced to active metabolites (in particular 1,25(OH)2D) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that enables the keratinocytes to respond to the 1,25(OH)2D thus generated. Numerous functions of the skin are regulated by vitamin D and/or its receptor. 

These include inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of differentiation including formation of the permeability barrier, promotion of innate immunity, regulation of the hair follicle cycle, and suppression of tumor formation. Regulation of these actions is exerted by a number of different coregulator complexes including the coactivators vitamin D receptor interacting protein (DRIP) complex also known as Mediator and the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (of which SRC 2 and 3 are found in keratincytes), the inhibitor hairless (Hr), and ?-catenin whose impact on VDR function is complex. 

Different coregulators appear to be involved in different VDR regulated functions. This review will examine the various functions of vitamin D and its receptor in the skin, and explore the mechanisms by which these functions are regulated.

Vitamin D has emerged as a pleiotropic regulator of human physiology, and recent work has revealed that it has several roles in control of human immune system function. Vitamin D was originally characterized for its role in calcium homeostasis, and the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), can be produced in the kidney by 1?-hydroxylation of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D catalyzed by the  **enzyme CYP27B1** . Renal CYP27B1 expression is regulated by calcium regulatory inputs, and 1,25D produced in the kidney was thought to function largely as an endocrine hormone. However, it is now clear that CYP27B1 is expressed in numerous tissues, and that 1,25D acts at several sites in the body in an intracrine or paracrine manner. In particular, both CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are expressed in several cell types in the immune system, where CYP27B1 production is controlled by a number of immune-specific inputs. Recent research has opened several windows on the molecular mechanisms by which 1,25D signaling regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses in humans. Moreover, intervention trials are beginning to provide evidence that vitamin D supplementation can bolster clinical responses to infection. This review will discuss recent developments in our understanding of how immune signaling controls local vitamin D metabolism and how, in turn, the 1,25D-bound VDR modulates immune system function. A particular emphasis will be placed on the interplay between vitamin D signaling and signaling through different classes of pattern recognition receptors in the production of antimicrobial peptides during innate immune responses to microbial infection.
