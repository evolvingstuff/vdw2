## Can sometimes stop sickle cell pain with vitamin D - Oct 2011

#### Complete Resolution of Sickle Cell Chronic Pain With High Dose Vitamin D Therapy:  
A Case Report and Review of the Literature

Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology: October 2011 - Volume 33 - Issue 7 - p 549–551, [doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31821ed3ea](https://doi.org/10.1097/MPH.0b013e31821ed3ea)

With age, individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience daily chronic pain. 

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) can result in chronic pain, osteoporosis, fractures, and muscle weakness. 

Several studies report a high prevalence of VDD in SCD; however, the clinical correlates have not been well described. 

We describe a case of SCD chronic pain associated with profound VDD, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis. 

Treatment with high-dose vitamin D resulted in  **complete resolution of chronic pain symptoms**  and improvement in bone density. 

Randomized studies of vitamin D in SCD may help elucidate its role in the management of chronic pain and bone disease.

We report results of a pilot study of high-dose vitamin D in sickle cell disease (SCD). 

Subjects were given a 6-week course of oral high-dose cholecalciferol (40 000–100 000 IU per week) or placebo and monitored prospectively for a period of six months. 

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency was present at baseline in 82·5% and 52·5% of subjects, respectively. 

Subjects who received high-dose vitamin D achieved higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, experienced fewer pain days per week, and had higher physical activity quality-of-life scores. 

These findings suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D in reducing the number of pain days in SCD. 

Larger prospective studies with longer duration are needed to confirm these effects.
