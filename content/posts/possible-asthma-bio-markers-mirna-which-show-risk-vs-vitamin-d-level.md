Background

Vitamin D may help to alleviate asthma exacerbation because of its anti-inflammation effect, but the evidence is inconsistent in childhood asthma. MiRNAs are important mediators in asthma pathogenesis and also excellent non-invasive biomarkers. We hypothesized that circulating miRNAs are associated with asthma exacerbation and modified by vitamin D levels.

Methods

We sequenced baseline serum miRNAs from 461 participants in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP). Logistic regression was used to associate miRNA expression with asthma exacerbation through interaction analysis first and then stratified by vitamin D insufficient and sufficient groups. Microarray from lymphoblastoid B-cells (LCLs) treated by vitamin D or sham of 43 subjects in CAMP were used for validation in vitro. The function of miRNAs was associated with gene modules by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).

Results

We identified eleven miRNAs associated with asthma exacerbation with vitamin D effect modification. 

Of which, 

* five were significant in vitamin D insufficient group and 

* nine were significant in vitamin D sufficient group. 

Six miRNAs, including hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-151a-5p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-22-3p and hsa-miR-451a were significantly associated with gene modules of immune-related functions,  **implying miRNAs may mediate vitamin D**  effect on asthma exacerbation through immune pathways. In addition, hsa-miR-143-3p and hsa-miR-451a are potential predictors of childhood asthma exacerbation at different vitamin D levels.

Conclusions

miRNAs are potential mediators of asthma exacerbation and their effects are directly impacted by vitamin D levels.
