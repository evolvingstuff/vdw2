At baseline, participants completed two self-administered questionnaires (SAQs) and a questionnaire administered by staff. Participants in the full factorial randomization (calcium, vitamin D, both, or neither) received a placebo during a 3-month single-blinded run-in; women electing to take calcium enrolled in a two-group randomization (calcium with vitamin D, or calcium alone) and received calcium during the run-in. Using logistic regression models, we examined baseline factors associated with RIF in three subgroups: men (N = 1606) and women (N = 301) in the full factorial randomization and women in the two-group randomization (N = 666).</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Overall, 314/2573 (12 %) participants failed run-in; 211 (67 %) took fewer than 80 % of their tablets (poor adherence), and 103 (33 %) withdrew or were uncooperative. In multivariable models, 8- to 13-fold variation was seen by study center in odds of RIF risk in the two largest groups. In men, RIF decreased with age (adjusted odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> per 5 years 0.85 <span>[95 % confidence interval, CI; 0.76-0.96]</span>) and was associated with being single (OR 1.65 <span>[95 % CI; 1.10-2.47]</span>), not graduating from high school (OR 2.77 <span>[95 % CI; 1.58-4.85]</span>), and missing SAQ data (OR 1.97 <span>[1.40-2.76]</span>). Among women, RIF was associated primarily with health-related factors; RIF risk was lower with higher physical health score (OR 0.73 <span>[95 % CI; 0.62-0.86]</span>) and baseline multivitamin use (OR 0.44 <span>[95 % CI; 0.26-0.75]</span>). Women in the 5-year colonoscopy surveillance interval were at greater risk of RIF than those with 3-year follow-up (OR 1.91 <span>[95 % CI; 1.08-3.37]</span>), and the number of prescription medicines taken was also positively correlated with RIF (p = 0.03).</p><p><strong>Perceived toxicities during run-in were associated with 12- to 29-fold significantly increased odds of RIF.</strong></p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>There were few common baseline predictors of run-in failure in the three randomization groups. However, heterogeneity in run-in failure associated with study center, and missing SAQ data reflect potential opportunities for intervention to improve trial efficiency and retention.</p><p>TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00153816 .
