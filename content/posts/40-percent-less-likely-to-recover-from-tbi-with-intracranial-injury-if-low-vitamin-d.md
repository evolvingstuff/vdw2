Vitamin D may be important for neuroprotection after traumatic brain injury (TBI) by modifying the inflammatory response. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and functional and survival outcomes in patients with TBI and intracranial injury. This study was a prospective multicenter cohort study conducted on adult TBI patients, with intracranial hemorrhage or diffuse axonal injury confirmed by radiological examination, admitted to five participating emergency departments (EDs) from December 2018 to June 2020. The study outcomes were good functional recovery at hospital discharge and survival at 6-months after injury. The primary exposure was serum vitamin D deficiency (0-10 ng/ml). Multilevel logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the association between vitamin D deficiency and the study outcomes. Among 606 patients, 101 (16.7%) patients had vitamin D deficiency at the time of ED arrival. 

Good functional recovery was observed in 65.2% (395/606) of total population, and this proportion was significantly lower in the vitamin D deficiency group than the non-deficiency group (56.4 vs. 66.9%, p=0.04, adjusted OR (95% CI):  **0.56**  (0.36-0.88)). 

Overall survival rate at 6-months after injury was 79.5% (434/546), and patients with vitamin D deficiency had significantly lower likelihood of survival at 6-months than patients without deficiency (75.0 vs. 80.3%, adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.59 (0.39-0.89)). 

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor functional outcomes at hospital discharge and mortality at 6-months after injury in TBI patients with intracranial hemorrhage or diffuse axonal injury. .
