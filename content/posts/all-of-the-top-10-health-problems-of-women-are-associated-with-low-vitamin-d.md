Based on Access Economics 2009 - Australia

List of disabilities: Anxiety - Depression. Type 2 Diabetes, Dementia, Ischaemic Heart, Stroke, Breast Cancer, lung Cancer, COPD,  Asthma, Osteoarthritis

Sorted by the % of total number of years of reduced health =  **Disability Life Year (DALY)** 

ALL of the top 10 items on the list are strongly assocated with low vitamin D

 **In addition** , Vitamin D reduces the risk of non DALY diseases which

&nbsp; &nbsp;  people die from too quickly: e.g. [Sudden Cardiac Arrest](/tags/sudden-cardiac-arrest.html), [Fatal hospital infections](/posts/sepsis-is-both-prevented-and-treated-by-vitamin-d-many-studies)

&nbsp; &nbsp;  are short-term: e.g. [Colds, flu](/tags/colds-flu.html), [Shingles](/tags/shingles.html)

#### [Just taking one capsule every two weeks %%% will cut  the risk of ALL 10 of the diseases about in half](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

Note: A Year of disability is weighted by the person's age [Wikipedia](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Disability-adjusted_life_year#/Social_weighting)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A year of a 20 year old is weighted as more valuable than that of a 2 year old or 70 year old

#### Huge decrease in many health problems as increase vitamin D (male and female)
