 **Transcript** 

* 00:03 Speaker 1: A lack of vitamin D is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in the United States, and Dr. Ray Matthews, a trauma surgeon at The Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, says, "It's a wonderful way for athletes to deal with what they're going through, and it's so powerful that it affects everything from your mood to your immunity." Dr. Matthews is joining us now to dig deeper into what he's calling... 'cause you like to use the word miracle here.

* 00:34 Dr. Ray Matthews: Yes, yes.

* 00:35 S1: But let's talk about vitamin D, because a lot of times when I think of vitamin D, I think of, it's in milk, it's in a lot of different food products, but you find that people still have this vitamin D deficiency.

* 00:47  **Dr. Matthews:**  There's not enough of Vitamin D in milk, there's only 100 International Units. The average person needs anywhere from 2,000-10,000 International Units, based on size and other characteristics.

* 01:00 S1: Okay, and how do you know how much you need? 

* 01:01  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well, I've gotten to be a expert at it, I can almost look at people and tell. This is from 15 years of research on vitamin D that I've kind of developed where everybody needs to be. Well, more importantly is your blood level, not how much you take. But everybody needs to take different amounts. You need to keep your blood level of vitamin D between  **50 and 80 nanograms per milliliter** .

* 01:21 S1: Okay, so there's a lot of numbers there.

* 01:23  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes.

* 01:26 S1: How do you even know if you're getting enough? 

* 01:27  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well, you have symptoms of vitamin D deficiencies, such as 

> fatigue, 

> being lethargic, 

> not having enough energy, 

> brain fog, 

> muscle pain, 

> joint pain, 

> depression, 

> confused, and 

> frequent upper respiratory track infections 

> are some of the symptoms that you normally see with vitamin D deficiency.

* 01:47 S1: Okay, and can you get it all naturally or do you have to start taking vitamins? 

* 01:51  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well, the most natural way to get it is the sun. We make vitamin D, the sun strikes our skin and then it goes to the liver and the kidney and makes vitamin D. However, due to the holes in the ozone layer, we had to make a compromise with the dermatologist where we tell people to go outside 10-15 minutes and then put the sunscreen on. And, so you can make up to 20,000 international units of vitamin D, but the thing that most people don't know, you can only make vitamin D from late March to early October. So you cannot make any from October all the way to early March, even if you stay outside. That's why people get the winter blues, 'cause your vitamin D level drops about 30% in the wintertime.

* 02:30 S1: And what do you recommend people do if they believe that they are experiencing some of those symptoms? 

* 02:35  **Dr. Matthews:**  Go see your physician, get your vitamin D level checked by your physician. It's a simple blood test, and then if it's low, they'll start you on the physician's prescription strength. And then personally,  **I take 5000 IUs a day** , just since I'm a large size, I'm 6' 2", about 200 pounds. So a smaller person can get by with just 2000 IU, so it's different based on the person.

* 02:57 S1: And you have worked with athletes? 

* 03:00  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, I have.

* 03:00 S1: And you said that this is something that really helps when it comes to some of the injuries that athletes get? 

* 03:04  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes. Okay, remember that your bones or, it needs Vitamin D. Vitamin D increases calcium, it makes your bones stronger. So rams will butt heads all day and they don't get concussions like we do, 'cause they have a thicker skull. So your head or your skull is a bone, so we have thin skulls, so more kinetic energy gets transmitted through that bone into the soft tissue of your brain. So a woodpecker slams its head into a tree 17,000 times a day and he doesn't get a concussion or a headache or stop and take an aspirin.

* 03:35 S1: Right <span>[laughter]</span>

* 03:35  **Dr. Matthews:**  So we have thin skulls. So when you augment the 58.3 million kids who are vitamin D deficient in United States. So I started working with a high school football team back in 2011, and we supplemented all these kids, got their levels up, and 85 football players, 13-14 games, they finished in the top five in the state, they only had one concussion the whole year.

* 03:57 S1: Wow, wow. And you believe that's the vitamin D that helped out? 

* 04:01  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, remember I said, "Vitamin D is a hormone, it's not a vitamin." So that separates it from the other vitamins. Vitamins are just like spark plugs, they make a reaction go at a lower temperature. There are 30,000 genes in the human body, vitamin D controls 3000 out of those 30,000 genes. So that's 10% of your DNA. So imagine the different things you could do if you learn to manipulate the DNA or the genes in your body. So I'm kind of like a kid in a candy store. So I can probably do more with vitamin D than George Washington Carver can with the peanut.

* <span>[laughter]</span>

* 04:33 S1: Alright, well Dr. Matthews, thank you so much for joining us.

* 04:36  **Dr. Matthews:**  Thank you.
