Peripheral arterial disease is a common and often overlooked entity responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence suggests that nontraditional risk factors such as vitamin D deficiency may contribute to atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, hence monitoring of vitamin D status is essential. This review tries to examine this entity. Published by Elsevier Inc. PMID: 20511096
