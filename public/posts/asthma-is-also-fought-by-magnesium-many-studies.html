Here we performed a Mendelian randomization(MR) analysis to investigate the association between serum magnesium concentrations and risk of 9 respiratory diseases.</p><p>Methods: Mendelian randomization was conducted using single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) associated with serum magnesium as instrumental variables.To select SNPs, we used publicly available summary-level data from Genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We used inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger regression approaches in this analysis.The IVW method was used in the primary analysis to obtain the causal estimates.</p><p>Results: Genetically predicted serum magnesium was inversely associated with the risk of asthma.The odds ratios in genetically predicted serum magnesium concentrations was 0.229 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 0.065-0.806; p=0.022),which was further confirmed by multiple sensitivity analyses. Other diseases such as pulmonary embolism, lobar pneumonia, COVID-19, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis and interstitial lung disease did not yield statistically significant results.</p><p>Conclusions: High genetically predicted serum magnesium was causally associated with a decreased risk of asthma and suggested that serum magnesium concentrations may be crucial to prevent the onset of asthma.</p><hr><h4 id=role-of-nebulized-magnesium-sulfate-in-treating-acute-asthma-in-children-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis---may-2024>Role of nebulized magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis - May 2024</h4><p>BMJ Paediatr Open. 2024 May 23;8(1):e002638. <a href=https://10.1136/bmjpo-2024-002638>FREE PDF</a></p><hr><h4 id=magnesium-for-treatment-of-asthma-in-children---sept-2009>Magnesium for treatment of asthma in children - Sept 2009</h4><p>Canadian Family Physician September 2009; 55 (9) 887-889;</p><p>Marcela Davalos Bichara and Ran D. Goldman</p><p>QUESTION Magnesium is considered adjuvant therapy for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in adults, but can it be used to treat children?</p><p>ANSWER Magnesium seems to be beneficial in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in children. It is a safe drug to administer, but there have been minor side effects reported, such as epigastric or facial warmth, flushing, pain and numbness at the infusion site, dry mouth, malaise, and hypotension. Owing to its bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects, magnesium is an encouraging adjuvant therapy for pediatric patients who do not respond to conventional treatment in acute severe exacerbations. Future studies should focus on establishing the optimal dosage for maximal benefits and the best route of administration. Magnesium should also be considered as a prophylactic treatment.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mg-asthma-2009.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=study-the-relation-between-serum-magnesium-level-and-the-severity-of-asthma-oct-2023>Study The Relation Between Serum Magnesium level and The Severity of Asthma Oct 2023</h4><p>.

Eby</p><p>In the rescue treatment of acute asthma, injected and inhalant magnesium are relatively weak having demonstrated value only in severe illness, although theoretical and laboratory considerations suggest that magnesium should be strongly effective as an asthma rescue agent.</p><p>It was hypothesized that a mouth–lung biologically closed electric circuit (BCEC) exists capable of nearly instantly transporting positively charged magnesium ions from the mouth and throat into the lungs.</p><p>One hundred milligram magnesium (magnesium chloride) 4-g throat lozenges producing 100+ mM magnesium ion concentration in saliva were tested to determine if they had beneficial effects in asthma rescue and prevention. Subjects were selected based solely on need for asthma rescue, and lozenges were used as needed. Case histories are presented showing the nearly immediate effect of magnesium chloride throat lozenges in terminating and preventing asthma attacks. Throat lozenges containing magnesium chloride produced much more rapid and stronger benefits than has been reported for inhaled and injected magnesium. An added benefit from magnesium chloride lozenge treatment of asthma was relaxation. In this first report of its kind, magnesium chloride throat lozenges appeared to provide rescue benefits in the treatment of asthma equivalent to pharmaceutical asthma drugs. Countering these benefits, strong ionic magnesium solutions greatly increase rhinovirus, herpesvirus and Candida albicans in vitro, and appear to worsen these infections in humans. Magnesium lozenges releasing concentrated magnesium ions appear contraindicated during common colds, oral herpes infections, chronic rhinosinusitis, oral and respiratory infections in general, and their use must immediately be terminated if respiratory or oral symptoms worsen. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in people without respiratory or oral infections are needed to determine magnesium lozenge safety, and the extent by which drug treatment of asthma can be reduced.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/asthma-mg-loz.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><h5 id=the-author-got-a-patent-for-it-the-next-year>The author got a patent for it the next year</h5><p><a href=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20070243232A1/en>https://patents.google.com/patent/US20070243232A1/en</a></p><h5 id=big-pharma-profits-for-a-competing-asthma-rescue-device-with-known-health-problems-pushed-the-magnesium-lozenges-out-of-the-market>Big-pharma profits for a competing Asthma rescue device (with known health problems) pushed the Magnesium lozenges out of the market</h5><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/magnesium-lozenges-no-longer-a-2ed0h39eRXqaAqBN7tW_2A>Perplexity AI Deep Research - Feb 2025</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384338"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384338",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384338"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384338"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384338"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384338"></script></body></html>
