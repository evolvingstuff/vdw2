# Announcement http://www.hse.ie/go/vitaminD

## But they warn not more than 200 IU

### "Very large doses of vitamin D3 may make your baby ill. Only one dose per day should be given."

## No other country we know of on earth has such a low vitamin D recommendation for babies.

## Even the US recommends 600 IU minimum for EVERYONE - not just babies
