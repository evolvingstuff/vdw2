To determine the effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) status on parathyroid adenoma weight, clinical, radiological and biochemical phenotype in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPTP) were studied.

Methods: Eighty-two patients with pHPT who underwent surgical treatment and in whom the presence of parathyroid adenoma were confirmed histopathologically were studied retrospectively. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group A patients with 25-OHD concentrations < 20 ng/ml (n=49) and group B patients with 25-OHD concentrations ≥ 20 ng/ml (n=33). Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin-corrected serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and urinary calcium excretion were determined. The results of preoperative imaging modalities (ultrasound, planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT) and parathyroid adenoma weight were recorded.

Results: 74% of patients presented vitamin D insufficiency (< 20 ng/dl). No statistically significant differences were observed with respect to serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatase concentrations, urinary calcium excretion and parathyroid adenoma weight between groups.  **The history of bone fracture was more frequent in group A (9.7% vs 1.2% P=0.03)** . Likewise, group A presented lower values of bone mineral density at femoral site, although it did not reach statistical significance (0.67 vs 0.73, P=0.07). Significant correlations were observed between 25 OHD and femoral mineral density (r=0.331, P=0.01), and serum PTH (r=−0.233, P=0.03). Parathyroid adenoma weight correlated with serum calcium (r=0.404, P<0.001), serum phosphate (r=−0.243, P=0.03), and PTH (r=0.523, P<0.001). No biochemical/pathological features were suggested to influence in the localization studies.

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is a common disorder in patients with HPTP. It seems to lead to more severe bone disease. Our results suggest that there is not an effect of vitamin D deficiency on parathyroid tumor growth.
