#### Vitamin D Workshop June 18-20, 2014&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the web at http://is.gd/VitaminDNews

Notes by Henry Lahore, admin of VitaminDWiki

 **<a href="/posts/does-less-sun-mean-more-disease" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Does Less Sun mean More Disease">Video: Does Less Sun mean more Disease?</a> (alternate title:Vitamin D explained in 5 minutes)** 

* Versions of the video has been viewed about 20,000 times in 141 countries (mid June 2014)

* Voice-over in English, German, Swedish, Spanish (Venezuela) (currently)

* Closed captioned in Portuguese,and Hebrew (currently)

* Was viewed at the workshop by about 50 people

* Probably will soon add Romanian, Ukrainian, Spanish from Spain, etc,

* Based on excellent viewership online and at the Workshop, Bio-Tech has provided continuing funding for it

> Our video has a good chance of becoming the most widely viewed Vitamin D video ever.

 **VitaminDWiki also provided the following at the Bio-Tech Pharmacal booth** 

* <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-testers-coming-soon-low-cost-and-easy" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Vitamin D Testers coming soon (low cost and easy) - June 2014">Chart of New Vitamin D tests expected in 2014-2015</a>

* Vitamin D salt shaker – about 1,000 IU/shake

* Lemonade – spiked with about 2,000IU/glass to demonstrate the idea of home fortification

> approximately 20 people either took the lemonade or fortified fruit juices provided at the workshop with 5,000 IU of vitamin D (powder from a single capsule)

* <a href="/posts/people-are-starting-to-notice-the-importance-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: People are starting to notice the importance of Vitamin D">People are starting to notice the importance of Vitamin D</a>

* <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-intervention-trials-a-long-list" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Vitamin D intervention trials - a long list - May 2014">Long list</a> (30 feet?) showing the vitamin D intervention trial using vitamin D (1200 trials)

* Slide show of <a href="/posts/incidence-of-22-health-problems-related-to-vitamin-d-have-doubled-in-a-decade" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Incidence of 22 health problems related to vitamin D have doubled in a decade">increased disease rates</a>

> all of which increased while vitamin D decreased

> all of which have been associated with low vitamin D

* Wore my [Vitamin D T shirt](/posts/increase-your-vitamin-d-from-the-sun-by-wearing-a-tan-through-instead-of-standard-shirt) one afternoon – got little comment

> It probably increases the Vitamin D a person can get from the sun by 50-100 % vs a standard T shirt (while standing up with long pants)

> Did, however get a recommendation of a person in the Middle East who might be interested in using the cloth to make burkas for women in Iran (so that the women there could get Vitamin D from the sun in a socially acceptable manner)

 **Overheard  a theory/hypothesis about Tanning bed and Dermatologists** 

Dermatologists are giving tanning beds a bad name because they are taking away business from Dermatologists (far less expensive to get therapeutic UVB dose from tanning bed). Also noted: cancer rate from UVB at dermatologists (for psoriasis) is higher than that from tanning beds

 **Hypothesis in a paper by Dr. Hollis was being talked about – if you take just a little vitamin D, you should take it daily** 

Hypothesis: At low concentrations, where there is too little to sequester temporarily (in body fat ?) one form of vitamin D does not stay in the blood stream very long. 

If hypothesis is correct then if taking less than an average of 2,000 IU daily it would be advisable to take the supplement daily. 

I agree with the hypothesis. I agree that it is slightly better to take vitamin D daily rather than weekly, etc. 

But, it is far far better to take lots of vitamin D infrequently than to not take vitamin D at all

Note: Dr. Hollis paper (Dec, 2013) is behind a paywall, and so is not on VitaminDWiki 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Role of the Parent Compound Vitamin D with Respect to Metabolism and Function: Why Clinical Dose Intervals Can Affect Clinical Outcomes

 **I explored the possibility of an experiment to deactivate a gene which causes early onset Parkinson’ Disease** 

* Talked to about 5 individuals

* All thought that the experiment was a possibility

 **Presentation by D Fraser strongly indicated that rainbow trout generate Vitamin D with blue, (not UVB) light**

90 minute video with complete transcript.  Multiple Sclerosis and many other auto-immune diseases. 

News items in the video:

&nbsp; &nbsp;They raise Vitamin D dose for a patient until PTH gets into the low normal range

&nbsp; &nbsp;Elderly have fewer Vitamin D receptors, (not confirmed yet)

&nbsp; &nbsp;Vitamin B2 is needed to process vitamin D (not confirmed yet)

A rare meta-analysis which ignored the does levels which were very low or too far apart in time

 **Huge range of doses normally all averaged together** 

 **If this were aspirin, a meta-analysis would average studies from 700 mg to 10 mg and conclude that aspirin does not reduce headaches**

Tricyclic antidepressants reduce the benefit of vitamin D in seniors.  Wonder about non-seniors

Described by VitaminDWiki. This gets most people to 40 ng/ml. 

You can chose to feel the benefits in 6-12 months or, if you restore levels quickly, as little as a week

Also describes doses for those at high risk.

Yes, even if low vitamin D was not the cause of your current problem it can be the cause for a future problem

only 38% of infants who were getting 800 IU had <20 ng
