Looked at hospital admission records for 8 million people over a 12 year time period

* Those admitted to hospital for diabetes aged 25-44 were 3.8 X more likely to later be admitted to hospital for Parkinson’s disease

* VitaminDWiki suspects a much higher rate would have been found if had waited for the young adults to get into the senior age range typical for Parkinson’s disease (25 years instead of 12)

* Reminder - Diabetes lowers the vitamin D level (perhaps due to poor gut ==> poor bioavailability), and lower vitamin D levels increase the chance of Parkinson;s Disease

Objective To investigate the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and subsequent Parkinson disease (PD).

Methods Linked English national Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data (1999–2011) were used to conduct a retrospective cohort study. A cohort of individuals admitted for hospital care with a coded diagnosis of T2DM was constructed, and compared to a reference cohort. Subsequent PD risk was estimated using Cox regression models. Individuals with a coded diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced parkinsonism, and normal pressure hydrocephalus were excluded from the analysis.

Results A total of 2,017,115 individuals entered the T2DM cohort and 6,173,208 entered the reference cohort. There were significantly elevated rates of PD following T2DM (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span> 1.32, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 1.29–1.35; p < 0.001). The relative increase was greater in those with complicated T2DM (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42–1.56) and when comparing younger individuals ( **HR 3.81** , 95% CI 2.84–5.11 in age group 25–44 years).

Conclusions We report an increased rate of subsequent PD following T2DM in this large cohort study. These findings may reflect shared genetic predisposition and/or disrupted shared pathogenic pathways with potential clinical and therapeutic implications.
