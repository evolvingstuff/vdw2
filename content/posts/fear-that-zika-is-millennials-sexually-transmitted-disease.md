* “We need to think about this in terms of a new sexually transmitted disease, one that is especially hard to combat because 80 percent of infections don’t cause symptoms, and both men and women can carry the virus for months.”

* “One mathematical model has estimated that around 3 percent of Zika infections are from sex.”

 **Estimates of Basic reproduction number (R0) (how likely to infect another person)** 

 **| | |
| --- | --- |
| R0 | Virus |
| 1.3  | Seasonal influenza  |
| 2 - 5  | H.I.V.  |
| 3 – 6.6  | Zika in Columbia  |
| 3 | Dengue  (no sexual transmission) |
| 4  | SARS  (not in NYT) |
| 1.5 - 2 | Ebola (not in NYT)  |**

* [Sex May Spread Zika Virus More Often Than Researchers Suspected](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/health/zika-virus-sex-spread.html?_r=0) NYT July 2016

* "To adjust for doctor-visit differences, the team compared the current Zika outbreak to two outbreaks of dengue, which is not sexually transmitted."

* "Even after that adjustment, said Flavio C. Coelho, a Vargas Foundation biostatistician and the lead author, women were still 60 percent more likely than men to be infected with the Zika virus. Sexual transmission, he said, “was the most probable cause.”

> Study = Sexual transmission causes a marked increase in the incidence of Zika in women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

>  **Dengue (same mosquito) in same city (Rio) did not have much increased infection for women (age-adjusted data)**

| Zika | 20,315 | 8,986 | 1.88 |
| Dengue | 56, 449 | 46,305 | 1.19  |** 

*  **Conclusion: increased female Zika infection was due to sexual transmission**

#### CDC: About 1% of the US Zika cases are due to sexual transmission - Aug 2016

[Zika Virus Is Sexually Transmitted, CDC Says](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/zika-virus-sexually-transmitted-infection)

CDC also states that the male can be infectious 

1. Before having symptoms

1. For 6+ months after having symptoms

Would have been nice if Congress had given money to CDC to deal with Zika

They could have, for example, provided free 

1. Condoms for the males

1. Chemicals to keep mosquitoes away from mane and women who are infectous
