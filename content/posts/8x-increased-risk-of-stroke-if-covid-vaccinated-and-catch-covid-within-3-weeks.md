#### Factors associated with stroke after COVID-19 vaccination: a statewide analysis

Front Neurol. 2023 Jun 28;14:1199745. [doi: 10.3389/fneur.2023.1199745](https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2023.1199745)

Background: The objective of our study was to evaluate vaccine type, COVID-19 infection, and their association with stroke soon after COVID-19 vaccination.

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, we estimated the 21-day post-vaccination incidence of stroke among the recipients of the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. We linked the Georgia Immunization Registry with the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry and the Georgia State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System data to assess the relative risk of stroke by the vaccine type.

Results: Approximately 5 million adult Georgians received at least one COVID-19 vaccine between 1 December 2020 and 28 February 2022: 54% received BNT162b2, 41% received mRNA-1273, and 5% received Ad26.COV2.S. Those with concurrent COVID-19 infection within 21 days post-vaccination had an increased risk of ischemic (OR = 8.00, 95% CI: 4.18, 15.31) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 5.23, 95% CI: 1.11, 24.64) with no evidence for interaction between the vaccine type and concurrent COVID-19 infection. The 21-day post-vaccination incidence of ischemic stroke was 8.14, 11.14, and 10.48 per 100,000 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S recipients, respectively. After adjusting for age, race, gender, and COVID-19 infection status, there was a 57% higher risk (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.42) for ischemic stroke within 21 days of vaccination associated with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine compared to BNT162b2; there was no difference in stroke risk between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2.

Conclusion: Concurrent COVID-19 infection had the strongest association with early ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. Although not all determinants of stroke, particularly comorbidities, were considered in this analysis, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was associated with a higher risk of early post-vaccination ischemic stroke than BNT162b2.

!!!!Factors associated with stroke after COVID-19 vaccination: a statewide analysis

Background: The objective of our study was to evaluate vaccine type, COVID-19 infection, and their association with stroke soon after COVID-19 vaccination.

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, we estimated the 21-day post-vaccination incidence of stroke among the recipients of the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. We linked the Georgia Immunization Registry with the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry and the Georgia State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System data to assess the relative risk of stroke by the vaccine type.

Results: Approximately 5 million adult Georgians received at least one COVID-19 vaccine between 1 December 2020 and 28 February 2022: 54% received BNT162b2, 41% received mRNA-1273, and 5% received Ad26.COV2.S. Those with concurrent COVID-19 infection within 21 days post-vaccination had an increased risk of ischemic (OR = 8.00, 95% CI: 4.18, 15.31) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 5.23, 95% CI: 1.11, 24.64) with no evidence for interaction between the vaccine type and concurrent COVID-19 infection. The 21-day post-vaccination incidence of ischemic stroke was 8.14, 11.14, and 10.48 per 100,000 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S recipients, respectively. After adjusting for age, race, gender, and COVID-19 infection status, there was a 57% higher risk (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.42) for ischemic stroke within 21 days of vaccination associated with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine compared to BNT162b2; there was no difference in stroke risk between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2.

Conclusion: Concurrent COVID-19 infection had the strongest association with early ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke after the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination. Although not all determinants of stroke, particularly comorbidities, were considered in this analysis, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was associated with a higher risk of early post-vaccination ischemic stroke than BNT162b2.
