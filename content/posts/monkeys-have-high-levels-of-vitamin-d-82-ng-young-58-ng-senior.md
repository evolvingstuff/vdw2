# 25(OH)D3 and cardiovascular risk factors in female nonhuman primates.

OBJECTIVE:

To determine if interindividual differences in plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) have pathophysiologic significance, we evaluated a cohort of female monkeys, seeking to identify associations with clinically relevant cardiovascular risk factors, including age, abdominal obesity (waist circumference), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

METHODS:

One hundred fifty-five female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) aged 3-25 years consumed a typical western diet for 7-8 weeks that provided a woman's equivalent of approximately 1000?IU/day of vitamin D(3). Measurements of vitamin D(3) and HDL-C concentrations, as well as waist circumference, were obtained.

RESULTS:

Among young monkeys (aged 3-5 years), compared to older monkeys (aged 16-25 years), the mean plasma 25(OH)D(3) concentrations were  **82.** 3±3.2?ng/mL and  **58** .6±2.9?ng/mL (p<0.0001), respectively. Plasma 25(OH)D(3) concentrations had a range of 19.6-142.0?ng/mL (mean±standard error <span>[SE]</span> 66.4±1.7?ng/mL). 25(OH)D(3) concentrations were inversely associated with age (p<0.0001) and waist circumference (p=0.016) and were positively correlated with HDL-C (p=0.01). However, when statistically controlling for age, none of these relationships remained significant. 

Conclusions: 

 **Higher plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D(3) were associated with more favorable cardiovascular risk factors, with inverse associations observed between 25(OH)D(3) and abdominal obesity, HDL-C, and age** . These associations were no longer significant when controlling for age.

## Comment by VitaminDWiki

Seems unlikely that the monkeys got this high a level of vitamin D from their food alone.

Suspect that the monkeys had access to direct sunshine or UVB lamps.
