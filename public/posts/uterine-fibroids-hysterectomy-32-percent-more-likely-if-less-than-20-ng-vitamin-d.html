Authors present ideas for future steps in this area. A literature search was conducted in PubMed using the following key words: “uterine fibroid” and “vitamin D”. The results of the available studies, published in English from January 2002 up to April 2018, have been discussed. Vitamin D is a group of steroid compounds with a powerful impact on many parts of the human body. This vitamin is believed to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibit angiogenesis, and stimulate apoptosis.</p><p><strong>Nowadays, hypovitaminosis D is believed to be a major risk factor in the development of UFs</strong> . In many studies vitamin D appears to be a powerful factor against UFs, resulting in inhibition of tumor cell division and a significant reduction in its size, however, the exact role of this compound and its receptor in the pathophysiology of UFs is not fully understood. According to available studies, vitamin D and its analogs seem to be promising, effective, and low-cost compounds in the management of UFs and their clinical symptoms, and the anti-tumor activities of vitamin D play an important role in UF biology. The synergy between vitamin D and selected anti-UF drugs is a very interesting issue which requires further research. Further studies about the biological effect of vitamin D on UF biology are essential. Vitamin D preparations (alone or as a co-drugs) could become new tools in the fight with UFs, with the additional beneficial pleiotropic effect.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uterine-fibroids.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=3x-reduction-in-uf-after-1-year-of-vitamin-d-less-than-half-got--30-ng-level--2016>3x reduction in UF after 1 year of vitamin D (less than half got > 30 ng level)- 2016</h4><p><strong>Hypovitaminosis D and “small burden” uterine fibroids: Opportunity for a vitamin D supplementation</strong></p><p>Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Dec; 95(52): e5698., online 2016 Dec 30. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000005698>doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000005698</a></p><p>Andrea Ciavattini, MD, PhD,a,∗ Giovanni Delli Carpini, MD,a Matteo Serri, MD,a Arianna Vignini, PhD,b Jacopo Sabbatinelli, MD,b Alessandra Tozzi, MD,a Alice Aggiusti, MD,a and Nicolò Clemente, MDa</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in women with hypovitaminosis D and “small burden” uterine fibroids.</p><p>This study focused on 208 women diagnosed with uterine fibroids and concomitant hypovitaminosis D, from January to December 2014. One hundred eight women of the initial study population were diagnosed with “small burden” uterine fibroids. Among them, those who underwent a proper vitamin D supplementation constituted the “study group” (n = 53), while women who spontaneously refused the therapy or did not perform it properly, constituted the “control group” (n = 55).

No correlation was found between the baseline 25-OH-D3 levels and the number of fibroids per patient (r = −0.10, P = 0.16). In women of the “study group,” a significant increase in the 25-OH-D3 serum level was observed after 12 months of supplementation, and a lower rate of surgical or medical treatment due to the “progression to extensive disease” was reported (13.2% vs 30.9%, P = 0.05).</p><p>Supplementation therapy with 25-OH-D3 restores normal vitamin D serum levels in women with “small burden” fibroids.

Although the pathogenesis of disease development is not completely known, growing evidence focuses on investigating the molecular mechanisms in disease development and the influence of ethnicity. Variation in the expression levels or function of estrogen and progesterone receptors, polymorphism of genes involved in estrogen synthesis and/or metabolism (COMT, CYP17), retinoic acid nuclear receptors (retinoid acid receptor-α, retinoid X receptor-α), and aberrant expression of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are some of the molecular mechanisms that may be involved. Nutritional factors, such as vitamin D deficiency, might also contribute to the higher incidence in dark skinned populations who are also commonly suffer from hypovitaminosis D. Culture and environmental difference might have a role in disease development. Further analysis and better understanding of these mechanisms will provide insight into the molecular basis of racial disparities in leiomyoma formation and will help to develop new innovations in leiomyoma treatment.</p><hr><h4 id=low-vitamin-d-associated-with-high-volume-of-uterine-fibroid-in-dark-skinned-women---feb-2013>Low Vitamin D associated with high volume of uterine fibroid in dark skinned women - Feb 2013</h4><p><strong>Serum vitamin D3 level inversely correlates with uterine fibroid volume in different ethnic groups: a cross-sectional observational study.</strong></p><p>Int J Womens Health. 2013;5:93-100. <a href=https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S38800.>doi: 10.2147/IJWH.S38800.</a> Epub 2013 Feb 27.</p><p>Sabry M1, Halder SK, Allah AS, Roshdy E, Rajaratnam V, Al-Hendy A.</p><p>PURPOSE:</p><p>Currently there is no effective medicinal treatment for uterine fibroids (UFs), a common health disorder that affects women of reproductive age. Identification of modifiable risk factors such as vitamin D (Vit D) deficiency could help develop novel strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of UFs. The purpose of this study was to identify whether low serum Vit D3 levels correlate with increased risk of UFs.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A total of 154 premenopausal women were recruited for this cross-sectional study. The control group comprised 50 subjects with a normal, fibroid-free uterine structure, confirmed by transvaginal ultrasonography. The 104 case subjects had at least one fibroid lesion that was 2 cm(3) in volume or larger, confirmed by transvaginal ultrasonography. For each case subject, total uterine volume and total volume of all existing fibroids were measured in three perpendicular planes, with volume determined according to the prolate ellipse formula (a × b × c × 0.523), where a is height, b is width, and c is depth. Serum Vit D <span>[25(OH) D3]</span> levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The independent t-test was used to compare serum Vit D levels across groups. Correlations were assessed by Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation test.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Lower serum 25-(OH) Vit D levels were significantly associated with the occurrence of UFs (P = 0.01). A statistically significant inverse correlation was also observed between serum 25-(OH) Vit D levels and total UF volume (r = -0.31; P = 0.002) within the case cohort. Subjects with larger fibroid volumes had lower serum Vit D levels and vice versa. Data stratified for ethnicity showed a statistically significant inverse correlation between serum 25-(OH) Vit D levels and total fibroid volume in black subjects (r = -0.42; P = 0.001). An inverse correlation was also evident in white subjects (r = -0.86; P = 0.58) but this did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Lower serum Vit D levels are inversely correlated with UF burden in different ethnic groups. Vit D deficiency is a possible risk factor for the occurrence of UFs.</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/serum-2013.jpg alt=image>
