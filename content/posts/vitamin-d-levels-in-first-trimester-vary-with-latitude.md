OBJECTIVE:

We undertook a systematic review to assess normative levels of vitamin D in early pregnancy and association with subsequent pregnancy outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN:

Medline and Embase databases and reference lists were searched. Inclusion criteria were pregnant populations, blood sample taken during the first trimester, and serum hydroxyvitamin D levels assessed.

RESULTS:

Eighteen studies reported vitamin D levels in first trimester (n = 11-3730), and 5 examined pregnancy outcomes. Mean vitamin D concentrations differed when stratified by ethnicity: white (mean <span>[SD]</span>: 29.4 <span>[11.7]</span> to 73.1 <span>[27.1]</span> nmol/L) and nonwhite (15.2 <span>[12.1]</span> to 43 <sup>[12]</sup> nmol/L). Most studies used general population cut points to define deficiency and found a large proportion of women deficient. Two articles examined risk of preeclampsia and reported differing findings, whereas 2 of 3 found low levels associated with increased risk of small-for-gestational age births.

CONCLUSION:

There is no clear definition of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy and insufficient evidence to suggest low vitamin D levels in early pregnancy are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
