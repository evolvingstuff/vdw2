# Comment by VitaminDWiki: Finnish <span style="color:#00F;">nutrition </span>board apparently decided on 2,000 IU upper limit because people cannot get more vitamin D from FOOD without fortification, supplements, or sun/uv

### <span style="color:#00F;">The Finnish nutritional advisory board states in their report that the recommended dose cannot further be elevated</span>

### <span style="color:#00F;">or “it would be even harder or even impossible to fulfill it without usage of food supplements in the whole population”</span>

Abstract: 	This thesis assesses clinical differences in patients with low and high vitamin D levels. The factors analyzed included the underlying disease, body size, age, ethnic background, use of vitamin D supplements and the season when the blood sample was taken. Fifty patients with the lowest and 50 patients with the highest vitamin D concentrations were selected from a cohort of 1351 chronically ill children and adolescents who had had their vitamin D status assessed at Children's Hospital. 

Protective factors appeared to be the usage of vitamin D supplements and young age, especially age <2 years. 

Predisposing factors included  **non-Finnish ethnic background**  and older age, especially age 12-18 years. High vitamin D values were more prevalent in the summer and autumn and low values in the winter and spring. Patients with non-Finnish background were overrepresented in the low value group. 

No differences regarding the underlying diseases could be detected. 

Conclusions: In the Northern latitudes UVB-radiation is insufficient for vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D recommendations appear to be inadequate to fulfill the needs of chronically ill patients whose requirements for vitamin D are elevated compared to the general population. New guidelines for vitamin D supplementation are needed particularly for those at risk of developing vitamin D deficiency.
