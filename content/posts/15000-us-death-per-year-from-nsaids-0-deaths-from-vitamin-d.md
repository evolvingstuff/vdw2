#### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

 **(NSAIDs) are medicines that are widely used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and bring down a high temperature. They're often used to relieve symptoms of headaches, painful periods, sprains and strains, colds and flu, arthritis, and other causes of long-term pain.** 

 **[NSAIDs – prescription and over-the-counter – account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs prescribed](https://www.naturalhealth365.com/over-the-counter-medication-increases-risk-of-stroke-3863.html)**

#### Aspirin: 3,000 US deaths per years (mainly seniors) - 2017

 **Vitamin D relieves pain and inflammation when levels are >40 ng/ml   
 This level is not achieved by a single 50,000 IU dose of vitamin D   
Vitamin D nanoemulsion applied topically to the skin or swished in the mouth   
appears to start to raise vitamin D levels within hours (does not have to go thru the gut, liver, nor kidneys)  
Vitamin D loading  (without nanoemulsion)can take days to achieve a useful level**

#### The dangers of NSAIDs: look both ways - April 2016

 **SNIPS** 

* "Preventable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are responsible for 10% of hospital admissions in older people at a cost of around £800 million annually. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are responsible for 30% of hospital admissions for ADRs, mainly due to bleeding, heart attack, stroke, and renal damage"

* "From the first day of use, all NSAIDs increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, myocardial infarction, and stroke. NSAIDs reduce prostaglandin synthesis, with differences in the extent of inhibition of the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. All NSAIDs increase both bleeding and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk but selective COX-2 inhibitors are more likely to cause cardiovascular events, whereas less selective NSAIDs are more likely to cause GI bleeds. The risk of bleeding and of cardiovascular events is considerably higher in older people, of whom many take medicines known to interact with NSAIDs."

* "NSAIDs affect the cardiovascular, GI, renal, and respiratory systems. NSAIDs reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin and have a thrombogenic effect on platelet function. NSAIDs increase systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg and increase fluid retention. In patients taking coxibs, diclofenac, and higher-dose ibuprofen, these effects cause an excess risk of 7–9 non-fatal and 2 fatal cardiovascular events per 1000 patients per year.2 All NSAIDs double the risk of hospitalisation due to heart failure."

* "NSAID use in patients aged >65 years more than doubles the risk of acute kidney injury in the next 30 days.3"

* "NSAIDs can precipitate bronchospasm and 5–10% of adult patients with asthma will have an acute deterioration in symptoms after taking NSAIDs.4 NSAIDs are also associated with a rise in HbA1c in type 2 diabetes."

* "Comorbidity and polypharmacy increase with age, as does the incidence of chronic musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, for which NSAIDs are often prescribed. NSAIDs increase the risk of hospitalisation in older people, and multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy compound the risk of CVD and bleeding events."

* "Bleeding is the better-known consequence with all types of NSAID use. Non-selective NSAIDs increase the risk of a GI bleed 4-fold, whereas COX-2 inhibitors increase this risk 3-fold. Co-prescription of NSAIDs with corticosteroids increases bleeding risk 12-fold, spironolactone 11-fold, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 7-fold.5 GI bleeds while taking NSAIDs are more likely to be fatal, with a mortality of 21%, whereas in patients not taking NSAIDs it is 7%.6"
