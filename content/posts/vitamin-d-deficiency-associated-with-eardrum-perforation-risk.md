Vitamin D deficiency associated (? = -0.002; P = .03) with tympanic membrane perforation (RTMP) related to otitis media, in 128 children.

Vitamin D: 30% < 20 ng, 27% had 20-30 ng

The risk for RTMP was associated with a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/mL.

"Vitamin D deficiency seems to be an independent and additive risk factor for the development of RAOM with RMTP," the authors concluded.

"These data suggest that in children with RAOM and RTMP, vitamin D level has to be determined and vitamin D supplementation could be considered."
