#### Association of polymorphisms of vitamin D gene in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis - Hospital based study

Heliyon https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23673

Narmada Ashok, Radha Saraswathy

Vitamin D gene polymorphisms are known to be associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis in children. However, the genetic association of the same in South Indian children with above condition is still unknown. The present study was designed with the objective to analyze the association of polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) (rs797532, rs154410, rs2258470, rs731236) and transport gene of vitamin D (rs7041) in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis in South India. Children (1-18years) presenting with symptoms suggestive of asthma and allergic rhinitis to hospital based outpatient department, in Vellore, South India were recruited as cases and children presenting with minor illness without respiratory complaints were enrolled as controls during January 2018 to September 2021. Polymorphisms were genotyped using tetra­arms PCR. Significant increase in levels of absolute eosinophil counts and serum IgE levels with decrease in vitamin D levels was seen among the cases. Significant association between levels of vitamin D and serum IgE was also observed. 

Analysis of polymorphisms showed that, in comparison to homozygous major allele the odds of having heterozygous (OR0.55 (0.3, 0.99) and homozygous minor form (OR0.52 (0.28, 0.97) of rs7975232, homozygous minor (OR 0.51 (0.34, 0.76)) and alternate allele (OR 0.7 (0.53, 0.93)) of rs154410 and homozygous minor form (OR 0.57 (0.37, 0.88) of rs731236 was significantly lesser among the cases. 

Genotypic model of rs154410 (p0.023) and allele form of rs7041 (p 0.041) were significantly associated with vitamin D levels however no association of gene blocks with cases was seen in haplotype analysis. There was an apparent gene pool difference noted in comparative analysis between Indian studies. The study is the first in south India to analyze levels of serum IgE, Vitamin D levels, association of VDR polymorphisms, and rs7041 in children with asthma.

Vitamin D gene polymorphisms are known to be associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis in children. However, the genetic association of the same in South Indian children with above condition is still unknown. The present study was designed with the objective to analyze the association of polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) (rs797532, rs154410, rs2258470, rs731236) and transport gene of vitamin D (rs7041) in children with asthma and allergic rhinitis in South India. Children (1-18years) presenting with symptoms suggestive of asthma and allergic rhinitis to hospital based outpatient department, in Vellore, South India were recruited as cases and children presenting with minor illness without respiratory complaints were enrolled as controls during January 2018 to September 2021. Polymorphisms were genotyped using tetra­arms PCR. Significant increase in levels of absolute eosinophil counts and serum IgE levels with decrease in vitamin D levels was seen among the cases. Significant association between levels of vitamin D and serum IgE was also observed. 

Analysis of polymorphisms showed that, in comparison to homozygous major allele the odds of having heterozygous (OR0.55 (0.3, 0.99) and homozygous minor form (OR0.52 (0.28, 0.97) of rs7975232, homozygous minor (OR 0.51 (0.34, 0.76)) and alternate allele (OR 0.7 (0.53, 0.93)) of rs154410 and homozygous minor form (OR 0.57 (0.37, 0.88) of rs731236 was significantly lesser among the cases. 
Genotypic model of rs154410 (p0.023) and allele form of rs7041 (p 0.041) were significantly associated with vitamin D levels however no association of gene blocks with cases was seen in haplotype analysis. There was an apparent gene pool difference noted in comparative analysis between Indian studies. The study is the first in south India to analyze levels of serum IgE, Vitamin D levels, association of VDR polymorphisms, and rs7041 in children with asthma.
