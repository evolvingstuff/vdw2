carotenoids: beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene,

J. E. Kim, S. L. Gordon, M. G. Ferruzzi, W. W. Campbell. Effects of egg consumption on carotenoid absorption from co-consumed, raw vegetables. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2015; DOI: 10.3945/ajcn.115.111062

16 participants consumed a raw mixed-vegetable salad with no eggs, a salad with one and a half eggs, and a salad with three eggs at different times. All salads were served with three grams of canola oil. The second salad had 75 grams of scrambled whole eggs and the third 150 grams of scrambled whole eggs. The absorption of carotenoids was 3.8-fold higher when the salad included three eggs compared to no eggs.

[Previous study found](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120619230234.htm)  that fatty salad dressings such as soybean oil, canola oil and butter worked as well – but would typically add too many calories to the diet
