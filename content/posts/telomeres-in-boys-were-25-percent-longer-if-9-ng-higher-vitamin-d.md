Introduction

Telomere length is seen as marker for healthy ageing, as accelerated shortening is involved in the development of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D might influence telomere length due to anti-inflammatory activities, because inflammation could decrease telomere length. Evidence supporting this theory is mainly from studies in adults, whether vitamin D in children is a predictor of telomere length is unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the role of vitamin D on telomere length in the transition from childhood to (early) adolescence.

Methods

Healthy Belgian children (n = 142) were followed-up between 2010–2015 (aged 4.7–10.7 years old at baseline, 50.4% boys). Serum vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D) concentrations were measured at baseline and in 2015 using standardized protocols. Average relative telomere lengths were measured in blood samples using a quantitative real-time PCR method. Cross-sectional and longitudinal age and sex adjusted mixed linear regression models addressed the association between vitamin D and telomere length.

Conclusion

This study over a 5-year period suggests that higher vitamin D concentrations are associated with longer telomere length in boys. These findings highlight the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D on ageing, especially since vitamin D concentrations might be easily adjustable through nutritional supplements.
