#### Placental disfunction associated with low Vitamin D (10 studies) - Jan 2025

 **The role of vitamin D deficiency in placental dysfunction: A systematic review** 

Metabolism Open Volume 25, March 2025, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2025.100350](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2025.100350)

Introduction

Vitamin D plays a critical role in pregnancy, supporting placental function via angiogenesis, immune regulation, and nutrient transport. Deficiency in vitamin D during gestation is associated with complications such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and preterm birth. However, the mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency to placental dysfunction remain inadequately understood, highlighting the need for systematic evaluation.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with searches in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published within the last 20 years. Inclusion criteria targeted human studies examining the association between vitamin D and placental function, including randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies. **A total of 10 studies**  were included following rigorous screening and quality assessment.

Results

Findings from human studies indicate that maternal vitamin D deficiency significantly impairs placental function by reducing vascular integrity, downregulating nutrient transporters, and promoting inflammation. Mechanistic evidence highlights decreased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and increased inflammatory cytokines in vitamin D-deficient pregnancies. 

Supplementation with active vitamin D <span>[1α,25(OH)2D3]</span> mitigated these adverse effects, restoring placental growth, improving nutrient transport, and reducing inflammation. Notably, population-specific differences and sex-specific responses to vitamin D sufficiency were observed.

Conclusions

Vitamin D is essential for optimal placental function and pregnancy outcomes. This review underscores the need for standardized supplementation protocols and further research into long-term and population-specific effects of vitamin D. Addressing these gaps can inform targeted interventions to reduce pregnancy complications and improve maternal-fetal health.

During pregnancy, maternal vitamin D insufficiency could increase the risk of preeclampsia. Aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status and the occurrence of placenta-mediated complications (PMCs) in a population at high risk. A prospective multicenter cohort study of 200 pregnant patients was conducted. The vitamin D level of patients with placenta-mediated complications was lower at 32 weeks compared to uncomplicated pregnancies (P = 0.001).

At 32 weeks, the risk of occurrence of PMCs was five times higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency ( **RR: 5.14**  95% CI (1.50–17.55)) compared to patients with normal vitamin D levels. There was a strong, inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels at 32 weeks and the subsequent risk of PMCs (P = 0.001). At 32 weeks, the vitamin D level of patients with late-onset PMCs was lower than the one of patients with early-onset PMCs and of patients without PMCs (P < 0.0001). These results suggest a role of vitamin D in the maintenance of placental performance and therefore in the prevention of the onset of late PMC.
