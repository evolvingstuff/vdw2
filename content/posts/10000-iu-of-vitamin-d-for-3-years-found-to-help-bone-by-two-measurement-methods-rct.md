High-dose vitamin D supplementation (4,000 or 10,000 IU/day) in vitamin D-sufficient individuals results in a dose-dependent decrease in radius and tibia total bone mineral density (TtBMD), compared with 400 IU/day. This exploratory analysis examined whether the response to high dose vitamin D supplementation depends on imaging modality and skeletal site.

 **Participants were 55-70 years, not osteoporotic with serum 25(OH)D 30 - 125 nmol/L.**  

Participants’ radius and tibia were scanned on  **high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT)**  to measure TtBMD, trabecular bone volume fraction (TbBV/TV), trabecular separation (TbSp), cortical thickness (CtTh), and finite element analysis (FEA) estimated failure load. Three-dimensional image registration was used. 

Dual X-ray absorptiometry ( **DXA** ) scans of the hip, spine and radius measured areal BMD (aBMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS). Constrained linear mixed effects models determined treatment group-by-time and treatment group-by-time-by-sex interactions.

The treatment group-by-time interaction previously observed for radial TtBMD was observed at both ultra-distal (UD, p<0.001) and 33% (p<0.001) aBMD sites. However, the treatment group-by-time-by-sex interaction observed for radial TtBMD was not observed with aBMD at either the UD or 33% site, and the 4,000 and 400 groups did not differ. Registered radial FEA results mirrored TtBMD. An increase in TbSp and decrease in CtTh underpinned dose-dependent changes in radial BMD and strength. We observed no effects in DXA-based aBMD at the hip or spine, or TBS. At the tibia, we observed a time-by-treatment group effect for TbBV/TV.

Given that DXA measures at the radius did not detect sex-differences or differences between the 4,000 and 400 groups, HR-pQCT at the radius may be more sensitive for examining bone changes following vitamin D supplementation. Although DXA did not reveal treatment effects at the hip or spine, whether that is a true skeletal site difference, or a lack of modality sensitivity remains unclear.
