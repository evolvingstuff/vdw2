Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations are thought to accurately reflect vitamin D stores, and vitamin D deficiency causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, irreversible bone loss, and increased risk of fracture. 

Recent studies suggest that decrease of serum 25-OHD level in mothers  **could increase the risk of preeclampsia, cesarean section, and craniotabes** . 

Furthermore, this deficiency may affect bone mass and the incidence of neuromuscular diseases of their children in the future. 

In the present study, the serum concentration of 25-OHD in 93 pregnant women after the 30th week of their gestation was determined by direct radioimmunoassay. Mean 25-OHD levels in spring, summer, fall, and winter were 14.3 ± 5.1, 15.7 ± 6.4, 13.7 ± 5.1, and 13.9 ± 4.2 ng/ml, respectively. 

Severe vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD < 10 ng/ml) was found in 10 of these 93 women. Overall, hypovitaminosis D, which was defined as serum 25-OHD concentration equal to or less than 20 ng/ml, was revealed in 85 mothers (89.5%). 

Serum 25-OHD levels were not associated with either intact parathyroid hormone or corrected calcium concentrations, but were negatively associated with serum type I collagen N-terminal telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase in these subjects. Mothers with threatened premature delivery had significantly lower 25-OHD levels (11.2 ± 3.2 ng/ml) than those in mothers with normal delivery (15.6 ± 5.1 ng/ml). 

In conclusion, the present data suggest a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in perinatal pregnant Japanese women throughout the year, which seems to affect bone metabolism and to be associated with threatened premature delivery.
