Craniotomy in turn may be associated with morbidity and even post-operative mortality. Vitamin D and calcium were known as protective factors on all-cause mortality. However, their role is not well-understood in post-surgery survival of brain malignant patients.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Totally, 56 patients completed the present quasi-experimental study, comprising the intervention group (n = 19) under intramuscular administration of 300 000 IU vitamin D3, the control group (n = 21), and the group of patients with optimal vitamin D status at admission (n = 16).</p><p>Results</p><p>The mean ± SD of preoperative 25(OH)D levels in the control, intervention, and optimal vitamin D status groups were 15.15 ± 3.63 ng/mL, 16.61 ± 2.56 ng/mL, and 40.03 ± 10.56 ng/mL, respectively (P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Crude survival was significantly greater in the optimal vitamin D status group than those in another two groups (P = 0.005).</p><p>Also, Cox proportional hazard model showed that the risk of mortality was higher in the control group and the intervention group than in the group of patients with optimal vitamin D status at admission (P-trend = 0.03).</p><p>However, this correlation weakened in the full-adjusted models. Preoperative total calcium had an inverse significant correlation with mortality risk <span>[HR value 0.25, (95%, CI: 0.09–0.66), P = 0.005]</span>, and age had a positive correlation <span>[HR value 1.07, (95%, CI: 1.02–1.11), P = 0.001]</span>.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Total calcium and age were predictive factors in six-month mortality and optimal vitamin D status appears to improve the survival in these patients, which should be examined more closely in future studies.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Surgical intervention, traditionally known as a craniotomy, is a gold standard in clinical management of brain malignancies, though the largest volume of tumor removal in this route is just an opportunity for treatment <sup>[1,2]</sup>. Brain malignancies, most of which include high-grade glioma, grade III and IV according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and metastatic brain tumors, have a low life expectancy since diagnosis <sup>[3]</sup>. The median of survival from diagnosis of high grade gliomas and brain metastases have been shown to be 12–15 months <sup>[4]</sup> and 3.9 months <sup>[5]</sup>, respectively. On the other hand, craniotomy may be associated with neurological deficit and even post-operative mortality <sup>[1]</sup>. Although there is limited investigation concerning post-operative complications and mortality and its predictive risk factors in malignant brain tumors, it was suggested that age, smoking, medical comorbidities, location of lesions, preoperative ASA, and KPS scores, and intraoperative bleeding could be related to post-craniotomy morbidity and mortality <sup>[1,2,4,6,7]</sup>. To date, however, the role of nutritional factors as an important part of a patient&rsquo;s lifestyle in these neurosurgery studies is largely unknown. Vitamin D and calcium have recently been gaining enormous attention in critically-ill settings. Studies have shown that low vitamin D concentrations are associated with inflammation, increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher insulin resistance and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients <sup>[8,9]</sup>. Moreover, vitamin D status correction substantially improves outcomes and decrease risk in other disorders such as CVD, diabetes, cancers, and overall survival in cancer patients <sup>[10]</sup>, <sup>[11]</sup>, <sup>[12]</sup>, <sup>[13]</sup>. According to a meta-analysis of trials in general population, vitamin D with calcium, not vitamin D alone, could reduce mortality <sup>[14]</sup>. In this regard, an extensive study on 1360 critically ill patients with serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;20 ng/mL could not find any meaningful effects of early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D3 compared with placebo on three-month mortality <sup>[15]</sup>. One study among colorectal cancer patients indicated that higher prediagnosis intakes of total calcium and milk could be associated with lower risk of death <sup>[16]</sup>. Another study on patients with early stage lung adenocarcinoma with serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;20 ng/mL indicated that vitamin D supplements for one year after surgery which could improve the survival compared with placebo <sup>[17]</sup>. This effectiveness has also been reported on patients with glioblastoma <sup>[18,19]</sup>. Moreover, in the surgical setting, a systematic review article supported this hypothesis that hypovitaminosis D is associated with postoperative adverse outcomes following the variety of surgical procedures <sup>[20]</sup>.</p><p>Interestingly, only a few study reported that brain tumor surgeries conducted in summer season associated with lower death rate during post-surgery follow up <sup>[21]</sup>. Therefore, given the lack of enough relative studies and importance of survival in patients with brain malignancies, the present study was conducted in the quasi-experimental design aiming to compare the effects of single high dose vitamin D3 in patients with serum 25(OH)D levels ≤20 ng/mL, with the control group and patients that had optimal vitamin D status at admission (25(OH)D levels >30 ng/mL) on survival after craniotomy for brain malignancies during six-month from surgery.</p><h5 id=section-snippets>Section snippets</h5><p>Study design and participations</p><p>A total of 56 patients completed the present quasi-experimental study, comprising the intervention group (n = 19) under intramuscular (IM) administration of 300 000 IU vitamin D3, the control group (n = 21), and the group of patients with optimal vitamin D status at admission (n = 16).
