 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D cancer research has increased substantially in recent years.

* Vitamin D continues to show positive anti-cancer effects against many types of cancer.

* Demographic studies recommend vitamin D supplementation to prevent cancer.

* Vitamin D modulates immunological function, anti-metastasis, and tumorigenesis, according to mechanistic research.

In this review, we summarize the most recent advances in vitamin D cancer research to provide molecular clarity, as well as its translational trajectory across the cancer landscape. Vitamin D is well known for its role in regulating mineral homeostasis; however, vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to the development and progression of a number of cancer types. Recent epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have revealed novel vitamin D-mediated biological mechanisms that regulate cancer cell self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation, transformation, and death. Tumor microenvironmental studies have also revealed dynamic relationships between the immune system and vitamin D's anti-neoplastic properties. These findings help to explain the large number of population-based studies that show clinicopathological correlations between circulating vitamin D levels and risk of cancer development and death. The majority of evidence suggests that low circulating vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of cancers, whereas supplementation alone or in combination with other chemo/immunotherapeutic drugs may improve clinical outcomes even further. These promising results still necessitate further research and development into novel approaches that target vitamin D signaling and metabolic systems to improve cancer outcomes.
