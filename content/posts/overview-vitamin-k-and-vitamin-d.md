 **Vitamin K2 is similar to D3 in many ways** 

1. Both vitamins were initially confused with its lesser form (D2 ==> D3, K1 ==> K2)

1. Both vitamins appear to influence health in large number of ways

1. Both vitamins in the body are about 1/10 that of a century ago

> Example: Grass-fed beef has a lot more K2, D3, and Magnesium

1. Need very little of both vitamins: <1 milligram daily

1. When Vitamin D3 is increased, it appears that Vitamin K2 should also be increased

1. Vitamin K2 understanding and research is about 20 years behind that of Vitamin D3

> One of the reasons: [No simple blood test for K2 as of Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-a-vitamin-k2-blood-te-vVTdLPwcTFyi1Z_PM8yvTw)

#### Apparently K2-MK7 Trans form is much better than Cis (Super K etc.) - Nov 2024

 **[Taking Vitamin D3? This Might Save Your Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ukyja7cpfM&t=127s&ab_channel=Dr.Abs) YouTube 20 minutes]** 

Before this video I was unaware of differences between forms

Presenter warns that if supplier does not list the Trans form it might not be in the capsule

Not all K2 suppliers use the Trans form

[Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-the-differences-betwe-UbvXJgS8Qw2VPMttVwsHyQ) agrees, Trans is far better than Cis

[SuperK at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-Super-90-Softgel/dp/B07RL1J9BV/ref=sr_1_5?tag=vdw-20) I have used Super K many years.

#### The Ultimate Vitamin K2 Resource- Chris Masterjohn Dec 2016

[Here](https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/)

Nice overview

Statins restrict K1 conversion to K2

All animals convert K1 or K2-M7 to K2-M4 for use

Recommends 100 micrograms - which no mention of increasing dose with higher levels of vitamin D

Good review of the commercial K combinations available on the market - here is just a portion of it - without hyperlinks

* Life Extension Super K With Advanced K2 Complex — 1 mg K1, 1 mg MK-4, 200 μg mK-7, with an additional 10 mg ascorbic acid from 25 mg ascorbyl palmitate. Sold by iHerb ($22.50) but cheaper at Amazon ($17.93). Eligible for Prime and Amazon Fresh. 20 cents per capsule, 3 cents per day to average 200 μg/d. Beware of the subscription button when buying on Amazon. The vitamins are synthetic. According to Life Extension, the MK-7 is synthesized in China and is bioidentical, but they could not verify for me that it is 100% all-trans, which is the natural form. The reason I do not advocate this supplement is because the high dose of K1 adds little value, and although there is no well-characterized risk of high doses, it is possible that multiple milligrams per day of vitamin K (this supplement itself provides 2.2 mg per capsule) may unnecessarily tax the body’s antioxidant system.

* Maxx Labs Vitamin K2 Complex — 500 μg MK-4, 100 μg MK-7, 100 mg calcium from calcium citrate. 20 cents per capsule, 7 cents per day to average 200 μg/d. $17.98 on Amazon, where it is fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for Prime. Be careful to avoid the subscription setting if you only want to order one bottle. Free of GMOs and allergens.

* Innovix Full-Spectrum K2 — 500 μg MK-4, 100 μg MK-7. 24 cents per capsule, 8 cents per day to average 200 μg/d. $21.97 on Amazon, fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for Prime. Both forms of K2 in this product appear to be synthetic but bioidentical. It contains caramel coloring derived from non-GMO corn, a potential source of allergens. I consider this the best choice for a mixed MK-4/MK-7 supplement.

* Country Life Vegan K2 Strawberry Smooth Melt — 500 μg total K2. MK-4 and MK-7 in unidentified proportions. 19 cents per smooth melt, 8 cents per day to average 200 μg/d. Almost identical prices on Amazon ($16.65) and iHerb ($16.67). On Amazon, it is fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for Prime. It is not clear where the vitamins come from or whether the MK-7 is bioidentical. It is free of GMOs, soy, and other common allergens.

* Pure Encapsulations Synergy K — 1,000 IU Vitamin D3, 1 mg MK-4, 500 μg K1, 45 μg MK-7. 47 cents per capsule, 9 cents per day to average 200 μg/d. $56 on Amazon, where it is fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for Prime. Free of GMOs and allergens. Taken to yield an average close to 200 μg K2, the amounts of vitamin D (200 IU) and MK-7 (9 μg) are rather low compared to the Innovix Full-Spectrum K2 (20 μg MK-7) or the Thorne Research D/K2 (1,000 IU vitamin D), but the unique combination of the three vitamins may be optimal for some people whose nutritional needs fit it just right.

 **MK-4 Supplements** 

* Thorne Research Vitamin K2 — 1 mg MK-4. 5 cents per drop, 1 cent per day to average 200 μg/d. Similarly priced at Amazon ($64.62) and iHerb ($64.65), and if ordered on Amazon it is fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for Prime. It is dissolved in a base of nothing but MCT oil and mixed tocopherolsd. This is the least expensive option in the list.

* Thorne Research D/K2— 1000 IU vitamin D and 200 μg MK-4. 4 cents per day to obtain 200 μg from each two-drop serving. Although available on Amazon from third party shippers at prices ranging from $36-$70, it is not eligible for Prime and it is much less expensive ($23.70) through iHerb. This is a great option for someone who also needs to improve their vitamin D status. When compared to the Thorne Vitamin K2, it has the added benefit that the dose of MK-4 is smaller so it is easier to take a consistent dose of 200 μg every day. However, don’t be fooled by the price difference: the bottle costs less (hardly more than a third the price), but on a per 200 μg basis it is four times as expensive.

* Superior Source Sublingual MK-4 Tablets — 500 μg MK-4. 29 cents per tablet and 12 cents per day to average 200 μg per day. Similar price from Amazon ($17.59), where it is shipped and sold by Amazon as well as eligible for Prime, and iHerb ($17.79). The company claims that the sublingual formulation offers superior absorption but I’m not aware of any specific evidence of this. It contains lactose, so should be avoided by people with lactose intolerance.

#### Natto starter kit

[Make your own Vitamin K2 / Natto at home from a starter kit](http://www.gemcultures.com/soy_cultures.htm)

Called Natto in Japan and Thau-nao in Thailand this cultured whole bean soy food has a strong, somewhat persistent, unique flavor.

The bacteria, Bacillus subtilis var natto, that culture the cooked soybeans make a sticky, viscous polymer during the 6-12 hours of incubation.

This creates wispy threads evident when the cultured soybeans are pulled apart.

A good source of protein, this robust soyfood adds zest to any grain or noodle dish, soup or sandwich.

A little goes a long way, so what is not intended for use in a day or two may be easily frozen.

Our Natto starter, imported from Japan, has a 6 month or more shelf life.

 **Natto Starter Kit:** 

This 11gm packet contains culture directions, recipes, and enough spore to start 3 batches of natto, each making 5 cups or 1.5 pounds.

$3.00 + $3.00 shipping in the US. As of July 2011 the supplier only accepts check of money order, no on-line sales

#### Appears that Vitamin K is needed to prevent bone loss - 2012

 **Vitamin K-Dependent Carboxylation of Osteocalcin: Friend or Foe?**

Adv Nutr March 2012 Adv Nutr vol. 3: 149-157, 2012

Osteocalcin originates from osteoblastic synthesis and is deposited into bone or released into circulation, where it correlates with histological measures of bone formation. The presence of 3 vitamin K-dependent ? carboxyglutamic acid residues is critical for osteocalcin’s structure, which appears to regulate the maturation of bone mineral. In humans, the percentage of the circulating osteocalcin that is not ?-carboxylated (percent ucOC) is used as a biomarker of vitamin K status. In contrast, when ucOC is not corrected for total osteocalcin, the interpretation of this measure is confounded by osteoblastic activity, independent of vitamin K. Observational studies using percent ucOC have led to the conclusion that vitamin K insufficiency leads to age-related bone loss. However, clinical trials do not provide overall support for the suggestion that vitamin K supplementation of the general population will reduce bone loss or fracture risk. More recently, results from in vitro and in vivo studies using animal models indicate that ucOC is an active hormone with a positive role in glucose metabolism. By inference, vitamin K, which decreases ucOC, would have a detrimental effect. However, in humans this hypothesis is not supported by the limited data available, nor is it supported by what has been established regarding osteocalcin chemistry. In summary, the specific function of osteocalcin in bone and glucose metabolism has yet to be elucidated.

#### MK7 is a natural form and is more effective in the body and teeth

 **[Accumulation in the serum](http://www.menaq7.com/?page=accumulation)** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mk-accumulation.jpg" alt="image">

The long half-life of MK-7 results in significantly better accumulation compared to MK-4. Research shows that in only 8 days MK-7 has 6 times better absorption. Hence, smaller quantities and less frequent intakes of MK-7 is sufficient in order to supply all of the tissues.

 **[MK7 more effective](http://www.menaq7.com/?page=efficacy)**

MK-7 is much more effective than MK-4 at doses that do not exceed the present recommended intake for vitamin K. MK-4 has to be applied in very high pharmacological doses (milligrams) to demonstrate benefits for bone and heart health. In case of MK-7, doses in micrograms – 1000x less - are sufficient for significant bioactive effect.

#### VitaminK2.ORG

VitaminDWiki became aware of[this nice site](http://vitamink2.org/) in Sept 2019

 **Site Table of Contents** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/vitk2dot-org.jpg" alt="image" width="700">

 **Vitamin K Myths** 

* 1.Myth: Vitamin K is a single vitamin.

* 2.Myth: I eat a lot of green leafy vegetables, so I am getting my vitamin K2.

* 3.Myth: With all the green leafy vegetables I eat, I am getting the benefits of vitamin K2.

* 4.Myth: I feed my children packaged cheese because I want to make sure they get plenty of vitamin K2.

* 5.Myth: I can follow adequate daily intake levels of vitamin K so I am sure I am getting enough vitamin K2.

* 6.Myth: I am taking a blood-thinning medication so I absolutely should not eat foods with vitamin K or take vitamin K supplements.

* 7.Myth: I feel great so I am definitely not vitamin K2 deficient.

#####  **Deficiency** 

|  
Rare, except in newborns.|  
[Common](https://www.jscimedcentral.com/Nutrition/nutrition-4-1077.pdf)

#####  **Daily Value (RDA)** 

|  
90 micrograms for women  
120 micrograms for men|  
Not yet established, but experts recommend 100 to 200 micrograms of K2 daily.

##### Toxicity

|  
No known toxicity if taken at recommended levels.|  
No known toxicity if taken at recommended levels.

#####  **Deficiency symptoms** 

|

* Bruises

* Increased bleeding time

* Small blood clots under nails

* Increased bleeding in mucous membranes.

|

* Weak bones

* Increased plaque deposits along gumline

* Increase in cavities

* Arterial calcification

#####  **Causes of deficiency** 

|

* Lack of green leafy vegetables in diet

* Anticoagulant medications (Warfarin/Coumadin)

* Antibiotics

* Fat malabsorption disorders.

|  
Lack of fermented foods and organ meats in diet.

#####  **Circulation in blood** 

|Brief (hours)|  
Prolonged (days).  
Due to Vitamin K2's longer molecule, it is [transported by different carriers in the blood than K1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11960685) and therefore, to different locations in the body. 

#####  **Effect on bone health** 

|  
Minimal|  
[Moderate](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.1228)

#####  **Effect on heart health** 

|Minimal|[Moderate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694037)

#####  **Present in brain** 

|No|  
Yes.  
The [MK-4 form of Vitamin K2 is the predominant form found in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22419547), but we don't yet know what it does there. 

#####  **What happens after consumption?** 

|

* Vitamin K1 travels to liver more effectively than to bones.

* Liver uses Vitamin K1 to activate proteins needed for blood clotting.

|

* Vitamin K2 travels to bone more effectively than K1.

* Bones use K2 to produce [Osteocalcin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9076586), a bone-building protein hormone, which also [supports metabolic health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2013746/).

* The MK-4 form of Vitamin K2 is effective at reaching tissues other than liver and bones.

* The [MK-7 form of K2 is 3X better at reaching bones . . ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17158229)
