#### One in five doctors with long COVID can no longer work: Survey

 **[MD Edge](https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/265092/long-covid/one-five-doctors-long-covid-can-no-longer-work-survey?ecd=WNL_EVE_230902_mdedge)** 

* "The survey, conducted by the British Medical Association and the Long COVID Doctors for Action support group, sheds light on the lingering effects of long COVID on more than 600 chronically ill and disabled doctors with the condition. It also spotlights what they describe as a lack of medical and financial support from their government and employers at the National Health Service."

* "Long COVID affects more than 65 million people worldwide. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people infected with the virus develop long-term symptoms. In the United Kingdom, health care and social care workers are seven times more likely to have had severe COVID-19 than other types of employees."
