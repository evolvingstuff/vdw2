Background

Previous evidence suggests that 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) <span>[25(OH)D(3)]</span> protects against several cancers. However, little is known regarding urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). We analyzed the association between plasma 25(OH)D(3) and overall risk of UBC, as well as according to stage and FGFR3 molecular subphenotypes.

Methods

Plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D(3) in 1125 cases with UBC and 1028 control subjects were determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. FGFR3 mutational status and expression in tumor tissue were assessed. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders. Analyses were further stratified by tumor invasiveness and grade, FGFR3 expression, and smoking status. Cell proliferation was measured in human UBC cell lines cultured with 1?,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). 

Results

A statistically significantly increased risk of UBC was observed among subjects presenting the lowest concentrations of 25(OH)D(3) (OR(adj) = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.82; P = .006), showing a dose-response effect (P (trend) = .004). 

The association was stronger for patients with muscle-invasive tumors, especially among low-FGFR3 expressers (OR(adj) = 5.94; 95% CI = 1.72 to 20.45; P = .005). The biological plausibility of these associations is supported by the fact that, in vitro, 1?,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) upregulates FGFR3 expression in UBC cell lines with low levels of wild-type FGFR3.

Conclusion

These findings support a role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of UBC and show that 25(OH)D(3) levels are associated with FGFR3 expression in the tumor. Because FGFR3 mutation and overexpression are markers of better outcome, our findings suggest that individuals with low levels of plasma 25(OH)D(3) may be at high risk of more aggressive forms of UBC.
