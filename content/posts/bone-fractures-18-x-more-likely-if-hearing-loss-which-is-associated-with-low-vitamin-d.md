High-frequency hearing loss and S-Ca, but not hormones related to bone structure and strength, or lifestyle factors, predicted incident fractures during 17 years of follow-up in women up to 97 years of age.

INTRODUCTION:

The fracture risk increases and inner ear function deteriorates with increasing age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hearing loss was of greater importance than bone-regulating hormones for the risk of fracture in elderly women.

METHODS:

In 1997, a random population sample of 63-82-year-old women, n = 552, underwent a physical examination, audiometry and blood sampling for analyses of serum albumin-adjusted calcium (S-Ca), parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH) vitamin D and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Data on medication, lifestyle, previous fractures, hearing, vision and dizziness were obtained using questionnaires. Data on subsequent fractures were retrieved, and censored at death, through December 2013.

RESULTS:

In 1997, 228 women (41%) reported a previous fracture, most commonly of the wrist (18%). During the following 17 years, 323 fractures occurred in 207 women (38%). Hip fractures were the most frequent, in 96 women (17%). In a Cox regression analysis adjusted for age and previous fractures, hearing loss, reflected by a high pure tone average ≥ 59 dB, almost doubled the risk of a subsequent fracture (hazard ratio (HR) 1.81, 95% CI 1.25; 2.61, p = 0.002). S-Ca (HR 1.21 (1.02; 1.44) p = 0.028) also predicted future fractures, whereas PTH, IGF-1, 25(OH) vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, smoking, degree of physical activity, impaired vision and dizziness did not.

CONCLUSION:

Hearing loss and higher S-Ca, but not bone-regulating hormones, medication or lifestyle factors predicted incident fractures, mainly caused by falling, during 17 years of follow-up in women up to 97 years of age.
