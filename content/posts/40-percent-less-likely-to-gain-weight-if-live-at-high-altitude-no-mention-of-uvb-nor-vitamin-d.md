#### [High Altitudes May Aid Weight Control](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/high-altitudes-may-aid-weight-control/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0%20) NYT article

* Previous studies of the general population have shown that the rates of obesity are four times higher in low-altitude counties than high-altitude ones

* overweight military serving at high altitudes (> 1.2 mile) had a 41 %  lower risk of progressing to obesity than those serving at low altitudes.

##### VitaminDWiki tried, without success, to leave the following comment at NYT

Colorado has the best ultraviolet radiation in the US, and thus has the lowest rate of many health problems - because UVB creates more vitamin D. Florida has more UV, but higher temperatures, so people in Florida stay indoors more. Details, along with many maps are at https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=4652.
