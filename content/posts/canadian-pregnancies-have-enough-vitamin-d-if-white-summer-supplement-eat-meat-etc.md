* 88% white, 

* 86% took supplements, 

* summer pregnancies

* The study appears unaware that people get [6X more vitamin D from meat and eggs](/posts/vitamin-d-from-animal-increases-6x-when-consider-that-already-processed-by-animal-livers) 

   * Vit D semi-activated by animal livers: i.e. 100 gram of egg  has 230 IU equiv. instead of 26 IU

* No data collected on sun bathing nor going on sunny vacations (which is common for people in northern countries)

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is reported as a prevalent public health problem.

OBJECTIVES:

We aimed to evaluate, in pregnant Canadian women, 1) vitamin D intake, 2) maternal and cord serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and maternal 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol <span>[1,25(OH)2D]</span>, and 3) factors associated with maternal serum 25(OH)D.

METHODS:

Women (n = 187; mean prepregnancy BMI 24.4 kg/m2, mean age 31 y) recruited to the Be Healthy in Pregnancy study provided fasting blood samples and nutrient intake at 12-17 (early) and 36-38 (late) weeks of gestation, and cord blood. Vitamin D intakes (Nutritionist Pro™) and serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations (LC-tandem MS) were measured.

RESULTS:

Vitamin D intake was comparable in early and late pregnancy [median (IQR) = 586 (459, 859) compared with 689 (544, 974) IU/d; P = 0.83](median%20(IQR)%20=%20586%20(459,%20859)%20compared%20with%20689%20(544,%20974)%20IU/d;%20P%20=%200.83), with 71% consumed as supplements. Serum 25(OH)D was significantly higher in late pregnancy (mean ± SD: 103.1 ± 29.3 nmol/L) than in early pregnancy (82.5 ± 22.5 nmol/L; P < 0.001) and no vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) occurred. Serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations were significantly higher in late pregnancy (101.1 ± 26.9 pmol/L) than in early pregnancy (82.2 ± 19.2 pmol/L, P < 0.001, n = 84). Cord serum 25(OH)D concentrations averaged 55% of maternal concentrations. In adjusted multivariate analyses, maternal vitamin D status in early pregnancy was positively associated with summer season (est.β: 13.07; 95% CI: 5.46, 20.69; P < 0.001) and supplement intake (est.β: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.01; P < 0.001); and in late pregnancy with summer season (est.β: 24.4; 95% CI: 15.6, 33.2; P < 0.001), nonmilk dairy intake (est.β: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.32; P = 0.029), and supplement intake (est.β: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.01; P = 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS:

Summer season and recommended vitamin D intakes supported adequate vitamin D status throughout pregnancy and in cord blood at >50 nmol/L in healthy Canadian pregnant women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01693510.
