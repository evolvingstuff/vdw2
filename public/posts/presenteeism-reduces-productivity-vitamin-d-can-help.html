The factors associated with SP when we study all workers are age, seniority, salary structure, working more than 48 hours, the contribution of worker&rsquo;s wage to the total household income and downsizing; factors among the &lsquo;unhealthy&rsquo; workers are working more than 48 hours and not having a contract. The most common reason for SP is &lsquo;did not want to burden my colleagues&rsquo;, 45.7% (95% CI 37.3 to 54.4), whereas &ldquo;&lsquo;I could not afford it for economic reasons&rsquo; ranked third, 35.9% (29.4% to 42.9%), and 27.5% (21.3% to 34.6%) of the workers report &lsquo;worried about being laid off&rsquo; as a reason for going to work despite being ill.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>The estimated frequency of SP in Spain is lower than certain other countries, such as the Scandinavian countries. The factors associated vary depending on the population analysed (all workers or excluding &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; workers). The reason &lsquo;I was worried about being laid off&rsquo; was much more common than the estimates for Sweden or Norway.</p><p>||** Why did you go to work even if you thought that<br>you should have taken a sick leave <strong>?| Percentage</strong> Because I did not want to burden my colleagues **|45.7 %</p><p>Because I would have accumulated the job |38.5</p><p>Because I could not afford it for economic reasons| 35.9</p><p>Because no one else could do my job |35.5</p><p>Because I did not want to be considered lazy or unproductive| 31.6</p><p>Because I was worried about being laid off |27.5</p><p>Because I was worried about being subjected to some other kind of retaliation |26.3</p><p>Because I enjoyed my work |21.4</p><p>Because I did not want to be considered weak |20.0</p><p>Because going to work was beneficial for my health |11.8||</p><p>Based on recall of events for the past 12 months</p><p>10% did not check any of the above reasons</p><p>53% had no recollection of coming in while sick in the past 12 months</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;16&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/reasons-for-sickness-presenteeism.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> **{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=predictors-of-presenteeism-country-stress-health-job-satisfaction-etc---2017-a-global-cross-cultural-study-examining-the-relationship-between-employee-health-risk-status-and-work-performance-metrics-img-srchttpsd378j1rmrlek7xcloudfrontnetattachmentsjpegpresenteeism-predictorsjpg-altimage-width300>Predictors of Presenteeism: Country, stress, health, job satisfaction, etc - 2017** A global, cross cultural study examining the relationship between employee health risk status and work performance metrics **<img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/presenteeism-predictors.jpg alt=image width=300></h4><ul><li><p>Survey of 254 multi-national companies of 117,000 employees, 2013- 2016</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;&mldr;some regions of residency (i.e. Europe and North American) were related to decreases in presenteeism while others (i.e. Asia and Latin American) were related to increases.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Decreased working hours predicted increases in presenteeism with working less than 30 h per week having the highest impact and working 41–50 h per week having the lowest impact on presenteeism&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>*** <span style=color:#00f>Thus: Presenteeism more likely if work in Asia/Latin America or are stressed_</span>_</p></li></ul><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/prediction-model-t3.jpg alt=image width=800><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/a-global-cross-cultural-study-examining-the-relati.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=causes-of-presenteeism---jan-2018>Causes of Presenteeism - Jan 2018</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.businessknowhow.com/manage/presenteeism.htm>The Hidden Costs of Presenteeism: Causes and Solutions</a> Jan 2018</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Dual-earner and &ldquo;sandwich generation&rdquo; households</strong> - Dual-earner families account for 48% of all married couples, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Without a stay-at-home spouse to care for a sick child, many workers will go to work when they, themselves, are ill in order <strong>to save their limited sick days for when their children are sick</strong> . Added to the mix are the 25 million American workers who provide informal care for an <strong>elderly family member</strong> or friend who needs help with basic personal needs and daily activities. Those who care for aging parents as well as their own children are called the &ldquo;sandwich generation.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><strong>Employer expectations</strong> - In today&rsquo;s often &ldquo;leaner-and-meaner&rdquo; workplaces, some workers trudge off to work when sick because they fear one or more of the following: appearing less committed to their jobs, receiving disciplinary action, or even losing their jobs. A day or more off can also mean burdening coworkers with job duties, coming back to a heavy backlog of work responsibilities, or missing work deadlines.</p></li><li><p><strong>Little or no paid sick days</strong> - A 2017 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that on the average, <strong>68 percent of private industry workers have access to paid sick leave</strong> . But the highest percentage of workers who receive paid sick leave fall into management and finance occupations. The average percent of workers in service and construction jobs that get paid sick leave is respectively 46 and 47 percent. As a result, many workers are reporting to work when ill to avoid loss of pay.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loyalty and Self-importance</strong> - Still others come into work when they are sick because they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want to let the team down,&rdquo; think no one else can do their job, or that the business will suffer if they aren&rsquo;t there.</p></li></ol><hr><h3 id=decreased-productivity-span-stylecolor00fall-health-problemsspan>Decreased productivity: <span style=color:#00f>All health problems</span></h3><h4 id=presenteeism-results-in-96-hoursyear-of-lost-productivity-in-japan---may-2018>Presenteeism results in 96 hours/year of lost productivity in Japan - May 2018</h4><p><strong>14 hour/year neck/shoulder</strong></p><p><strong>Presenteeism results in 96 hours/year of lost productivity in Japan, and Medical and Pharmaceutical Expenses in Japanese Employers.</strong></p><p>J Occup Environ Med. 2018 May;60(5):e273-e280. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001291.>doi: 10.1097/JOM.0000000000001291.</a></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/presenteeism-japan.jpg alt=image width=500>

Absenteeism and presenteeism were measured by a self-administered questionnaire for workers, and their costs were estimated using the human capital approach.

To this end, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to conduct a secondary data analysis of a randomized clinical trial involving 78 Tension-type Headache (TTH) patients. The results showed that TTH presenteeism did not directly relate to health-related loss of productivity, either due to physical, or mental health problems. However, through anxiety-state, TTH presenteeism decreased patients&rsquo; productivity, as consequence of reduced physical and mental health. Moreover, by increasing the severity of the Tension-Type Headache, TTH presenteeism indirectly decreased patients&rsquo; productivity as consequence of reduced physical health (but not mental health).</p><p>Finally, our results show that such indirect effects only occur when the cause of TTH is non-mechanical (e.g., hormonal causes, etc.). Our work provides an integrative model that can inform organizational behaviorists and health professionals (e.g., physiotherapists).

Specifically, data were included from NHWS respondents who self-reported being employed in the past week and having experienced LBP in the past month, with these symptoms lasting for at least 3 months (n=239). 84 (35.1%) participants in this study were female.</p><p>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:</p><p>Presenteeism and HRQoL were measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-General Health (categorical (none: 0%, low: 10%-20%, high: ≥30%) and continuous) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, respectively. Covariates included patient demographics, health characteristics, pain characteristics and depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire).</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p><strong>Presenteeism was reported by 77.4% of respondents</strong> . High (vs no) presenteeism related to more severe pain in the prior week (4.9±2.2 vs 3.6±2.1, p=0.001) and currently (5.1±2.1 vs 3.9±3.9, p=0.007), more pain sites (1.9±1.6 vs 1.1±1.4, p=0.004) and greater depression severity (7.5±6.5 vs 3.6±3.6, p&lt;0.001). Adjusting for covariates, high (vs no) presenteeism related to lower mental and physical HRQoL. For low versus no presenteeism, significant HRQoL differences were observed in general health (43.0, 95% CI 40.3 to 45.6 vs 46.9, 95% CI 43.9 to 49.8, p=0.015).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Most respondents experienced presenteeism. Those with high or low presenteeism had poorer HRQoL than respondents with no presenteeism.

We used a human capital approach to estimate indirect costs measured by lost productivity from morbidity (absenteeism, presenteeism, lost household productivity, and inability to work) and premature mortality, using the 2008-2013 National Health Interview Survey, 2013 daily housework value data, 2013 mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research, and mean wages from the 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The corresponding estimates for direct medical costs were $2.8 billion (range: $0.3-22.9) and $8,544 (range: $6,591-12,953) and for indirect costs were $3.0 billion (range: $0.4-32.6) and $9,672 (range: $7,133-17,962).

Costs considered included the following: (1) financial costs associated with health care, informal care provided outside healthcare sector, productivity losses, nonmedical work and vehicle accident costs, deadweight loss through inefficiencies relating to lost taxation revenue and welfare payments; and (2) nonfinancial costs of loss of well-being. They were expressed in US dollars ($).</p><p>RESULTS: The estimated overall cost of inadequate sleep in Australia in 2016-2017 (population: 24.8 million) was $45.21 billion. The financial cost component was $17.88 billion, comprised of as follows: direct health costs of $160 million for sleep disorders and $1.08 billion for associated conditions; productivity losses of $12.19 billion ($5.22 billion reduced employment, $0.61 billion premature death, $1.73 billion absenteeism, and $4.63 billion presenteeism); nonmedical accident costs of $2.48 billion; informal care costs of $0.41 billion; and deadweight loss of $1.56 billion. The nonfinancial cost of reduced well-being was $27.33 billion.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The financial and nonfinancial costs associated with inadequate sleep are substantial. The estimated total financial cost of $17.88 billion represents 1.55 percent of Australian gross domestic product. The estimated nonfinancial cost of $27.33 billion represents 4.6 percent of the total Australian burden of disease for the year.
