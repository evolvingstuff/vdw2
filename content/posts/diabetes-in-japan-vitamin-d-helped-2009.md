AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Calcium and vitamin D have been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes, but epidemiological evidence is limited. We examined prospectively the relation of calcium and vitamin D intake to type 2 diabetes risk in a Japanese cohort. 

METHODS: Participants were 59,796 middle-aged and older men and women, who participated in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study and had no history of type 2 diabetes or other serious diseases. Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D were estimated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between intake of these nutrients and self-reported newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 

RESULTS: During a 5 year follow-up, 1,114 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. Overall, calcium intake was not associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes; the multivariable odds ratio for the highest vs lowest quartiles was 0.93 (95% CI 0.71-1.22) in men and 0.76 (95% CI 0.56-1.03) in women. However, among participants with a higher vitamin D intake, calcium intake was inversely associated with diabetes risk; the odds ratio for the highest vs lowest intake categories was 0.62 (95% CI 0.41-0.94) in men and 0.59 (95% CI 0.38-0.91) in women. Dairy food intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in women only. 

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Calcium and vitamin D may not be independently associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Our finding suggesting a joint action of these nutrients against type 2 diabetes warrants further investigation. PMID: 19823801
