 **Definition from the web** 

Early breast cancer (stage I or II) is the most common invasive breast cancer in the U.S. Stage I breast cancers are smaller than 2 centimeters and have not spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit (axillary nodes). Stage II breast cancers are either larger than 2 centimeters or have spread to the axillary nodes.

 **Early**  appears to relate to  **Early**  detection,  **NOT Early-Onset**
