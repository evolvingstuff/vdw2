For non-obese individuals (n = 109), the reduction of 3-month PTH was approximately linear for increasing vitamin D3 doses. At supplementation of 2,000 to 4,000 IU/day, 3-month 25(OH)vitamin D levels were high in both non-obese and obese individuals, but the 3-month PTH levels remained about 10 pg/mL higher in individuals with obesity.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that excess adiposity confers resistance to vitamin D efficacy in suppressing PTH levels, even when given at high doses.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/obesity-pth-blacks.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=different-threshold-for-obese-adolescents---2021>Different threshold for obese adolescents - 2021</h4><p><strong>Different threshold levels of circulating total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D for the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency in obese adolescents</strong></p><p>Eur J Pediatr . 2021 Jun 11. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-04137-5>doi: 10.1007/s00431-021-04137-5</a></p><p>The total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)DT]</span> level is lower in obese individuals than in their nonobese peers, despite similar bone turnover markers and bone mineral density.

So we wanted to evaluate the vitamin D adequacy with bioavailable and free vitamin D. In order to calculate the bioavailable and free vitamin D according to the previously reported formula, VDBP level was measured. VDBP polymorphisms were also evaluated as they can affect the binding affinity.</p><p>Methods: Eighty-four obese and 78 healthy children included in the study. Anthropometry, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline-phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, 25 (OH) vitamin D, bioavailable-free vitamin D, VDBP level and polymorphism were evaluated in the whole group.</p><p>Results: When the girls compared within themselves, PTH values were found to be higher in the obese group (p=0.001). When we compared obese and control subjects without gender discrimination, VDBP and PTH levels were found to be statistically higher in the obese group(respectively p=0.008, p=0.002). When only the cases included in the winter period were analyzed, PTH and VDBP were found to be higher and bioavailable and free vitamin D lower in the obese group. There was no difference in terms of total vitamin D between groups during the winter season.</p><p>Discussion/conclusion: While total, free, bioavailable vitamin D in obese group was similar to the control group in autumn, free and bioavailable vitamin D in the winter was lower than the control group. Also PTH was higher in obese group than the control group in both autumn and winter. Therefore, many more studies are needed to evaluate the variability of free, bioavailable vitamin D according to the seasons and its effects.</p><hr><h4 id=pth-children-obesity---2019>PTH, Children, Obesity - 2019</h4><p><strong>The relation between circulating levels of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity: Quest for a threshold</strong></p><p>The level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) at which intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) is maximally suppressed (suppression point) and below which PTH begins to rise (inflection point) has been used to define optimum 25(OH)D concentration. We aimed to study the association of circulating iPTH with 25(OH)D concentrations and to determine a 25(OH)D threshold associated with a significant iPTH suppression. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 198 boys and 180 girls, aged 6–13 years with BMI ≥ 1SD (WHO criteria) recruited from primary schools. Adjusted iPTH for BMI z-score, pubertal status, and dietary calcium was used. Nonlinear regression was used to model the relationship between 25(OH)D and iPTH and identify a suppression point for 25(OH)D at which iPTH reached a plateau. Piecewise regression analysis with a single knot for all possible values of 25(OH)D were fitted. Furthermore, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for those point had been calculated. The mean age (SD) of girls and boys was 9.1 (1.6) and 9.4 (1.7) years, respectively. Median 25(OH)D and iPTH were 13.8 ng/mL and 33.9 pg/mL in boys and 9.9 ng/mL and 47.8 ng/mL in girls, respectively. The equation in girls was: log-iPTH = 3.598+0.868 exp<span>[(-0.190×25(OH)D]</span>. The point for near maximal suppression of iPTH by 25(OH)D for girls occurred at a 25(OH)D concentration of 20 ng/mL (95% CI: 7.1 to 32.2). No point of maximal suppression was found for boys. We also found a 25(OH)D threshold of 10 ng/mL (95% CI: 4.6 to 22.5) for girls (f: 9.8) by linear piecewise regression modeling of adjusted iPTH. No significant inflection point for boys was observed. In overweight/obese girls, when the concentration of 25(OH)D was higher than 20 ng/mL, an iPTH mean plateau level is reached, and when its concentrations approach 10 ng/mL, the slope of iPTH concentration has been accelerated.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/pth-children-obesity---2019.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=39-pth-studies-in-vitamindwiki>39 PTH studies in VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><strong><a href=https://VitaminDWiki.com/Based+on+PTH+response%2C+obese+adolescents+may+not+need+and+much+vitamin+D+as+non-obese+%2812+ng+vs+16.5+ng%29+%E2%80%93+June+2021#Vitamin_D_titles_containing_PTH_OR_Parathyroid>Vitamin D titles containing PTH OR Parathyroid</a> 39 pages as of June 2021</strong></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/parathyroid-hormone-level-is-inversely-associated-with-both-vitamin-d-and-age>Parathyroid hormone level is inversely associated with both Vitamin D and age – April 2021</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/parathyroid-increase-with-age-associated-with-worsening-vitamin-d-genes>Parathyroid increase with age associated with worsening Vitamin D genes – April 2020</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/pth-failed-to-decrease-with-vitamin-d-if-overweight-and-had-low-magnesium>PTH failed to decrease with Vitamin D if overweight and had low Magnesium – Aug 2019</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/parathyroid-vitamin-d-inflection-points-might-be-at-both-16-and-32-ng>Parathyroid – Vitamin D inflection points might be at both 16 and 32 ng – Oct 2019</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/parathyroid-hormone-levels-increase-63-percent-with-age-33000-people>Parathyroid Hormone levels increase 63 percent with age (33,000 people) – Sept 2017</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/3000-iu-of-vitamin-d-minimum-to-reduce-parathyroid-hormone-pth-meta-analysis>3000 IU of vitamin D minimum to reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) – meta-analysis Sept 2015</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/african-americans-need-only-20-ng-of-vitamin-not-30-ng-based-on-ipth>African-Americans need only 20 ng of vitamin, not 30 ng, based on iPTH – Sept 2012</a></p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
