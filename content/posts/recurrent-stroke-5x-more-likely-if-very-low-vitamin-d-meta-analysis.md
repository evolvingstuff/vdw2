Stroke recurrence significantly improves the prognosis quoad vitam et valetudinem of patients with a first ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Other than in bone and skeletal metabolism, vitamin D is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between 25OH-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels at the first stroke and the stroke recurrence. To 31 July 2022, four prospective studies were identified. The potential non-linear relationship was evaluated by modelling 25(OH)D, using restricted cubic splines of 25(OH)D distribution. The pooled estimated risk (and 95% CI) of the recurrence of stroke, comparing the highest and the lowest levels, was assessed using a random-effect model. A non-linear association was found by dose-response analysis. This study found that 25(OH)D levels at the first stroke ≥9.3 ng/mL were associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence, compared with 25(OH)D levels ≤8.5 ng/mL. In the pooled analysis, higher 25(OH)D levels at the first stroke significantly reduce the risk of stroke recurrence, with a significant heterogeneity among studies. In conclusion, 25(OH)D levels ≤8.5 ng/mL at the first stroke are significantly associated with a higher risk of recurrent stroke.

Stroke recurrence significantly improves the prognosis quoad vitam et valetudinem of patients with a first ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Other than in bone and skeletal metabolism, vitamin D is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between 25OH-vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels at the first stroke and the stroke recurrence. To 31 July 2022, four prospective studies were identified. The potential non-linear relationship was evaluated by modelling 25(OH)D, using restricted cubic splines of 25(OH)D distribution. The pooled estimated risk (and 95% CI) of the recurrence of stroke, comparing the highest and the lowest levels, was assessed using a random-effect model. A non-linear association was found by dose-response analysis. This study found that 25(OH)D levels at the first stroke ≥9.3 ng/mL were associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence, compared with 25(OH)D levels ≤8.5 ng/mL. In the pooled analysis, higher 25(OH)D levels at the first stroke significantly reduce the risk of stroke recurrence, with a significant heterogeneity among studies. In conclusion, 25(OH)D levels ≤8.5 ng/mL at the first stroke are significantly associated with a higher risk of recurrent stroke.
