The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of 25(OH)VD3 with different inclusion levels of **<span style="color:#00F;">0, 25, 50 and 75 µg/kg in the diet</span>**  on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, bone properties and pork quality in growing-finishing pigs. The results showed that the average daily gain (p < 0.05) and body weight (p < 0.10) of pigs showed a trend of increasing quadratically as inclusion levels of 25(OH)VD3 increased.

Dietary supplementation of 50 µg/kg 25(OH)VD3 increased calcium digestibility compared with the 0 µg/kg group (p <; 0.05), and calcium and phosphorus digestibility increased quadratically as inclusion levels of 25(OH)VD3 increased (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 50 µg/kg 25(OH)VD3  **increased concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and decreased contents of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids**  in the longissimus dorsi of pigs (p < 0.05). 

The addition of 25, 50 and 75 µg/kg 25(OH)VD3 to the diet increased breaking strength and bone stiffness in the tibia compared with the 0 µg/kg group (p < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of 50 µg/kg 25(OH)VD3 improved the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Cu/Zn SOD in the longissimus dorsi compared with the 0 µg/kg group (p < 0.05). Supplementing 50 µg/kg 25(OH)VD3 improved the mRNA expression of calcium-binding protein D9k (CaBP-D9k) and D28k (CaBP-D28K) in the liver compared with the 0 µg/kg 25(OH)D3 group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, a diet with an added dose of 50 µg/kg 25(OH)VD3 showed a greatest growth performance of growing-finishing pigs, and 25(OH)VD3 enhanced calcium deposition and antioxidant capacity in the longissimus dorsi, which may be associated with improved expression of calcium ion channel proteins.
