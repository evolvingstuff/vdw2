#### Most of the world wants to prevent COVID-19 (not just treat it)

 **The immune system can prevent many infections by:** 

1) Injecting a vaccine which causes it to create COVID-19 antibodies

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expensive COVID-19 vaccines might become available in in early 2021

   * Unsure if the vaccines will work and have few side effects

   * Unsure if the vaccine created antibodies will last a long time

   * Unsure if the antibodies will be appropriate for continued COVID-19 muttations 

2) Being strong enough to naturally and quickly create antibodies

   * Vitamin D appears to prevent COVID-19, but much more data is needed

   * There are additional ways to somewhat fortify the immune system, but none are a fast-acting as Vitamin D

 **[COVID-19 treated by Vitamin D - studies, reports, videos](/posts/covid-19-treated-by-vitamin-d-studies-reports-videos)**  as of July 29 includes

   * 21 trials (generally treatment, not prevention), +10 observational studies, +7 recommendations, 

   * > 34 associations, +58 speculations, +20 videos, [and a July 3rd major overview](/posts/massive-review-of-papers-on-vitamin-d-and-covid-19) 

The observational data appears to indicate that  **>40 ng/ml**  level of Vitamin D is needed to protect most people 

That vitamin D level can be reached or exceeded by dosing protocols such as:

| | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| How long <br>until >40 ng | Loading <br>dose | Maintenance <br>dose | Total Vit D to <br>get to >40 ng | $ Vitamin D<br>for 3 months |
| 3 days | 400,000 IU (10mg) once | 200,000 IU (5mg) monthly | 400,000 IU (10mg) | $0.03 (water) |
| 3 days | 400,000 IU (10mg) once  | 50,000 IU (1.6mg) weeky | 400,000 IU (10mg) | $0.03 (water) |
| 7 days | 50,000 IU  (1.6mg) daily for 8 days | 50,000 IU (1.6mg) weeky | 400,000 IU (10mg) | $2.60  (capsules) |
| ((Respond to daily Vitamin D in 2-12 months | 40 days)) | 2 X 5,000 IU daily for 40 days | 5,000 IU daily | 400,000 IU(10mg)  | $7.20  (capsules) |
| ((Respond to daily Vitamin D in 2-12 months | 80 days)) | 5,000 IU daily for 80 days | 5,000 IU daily | 400,000 IU | $7.20  (capsules) |

Note: 400,000 IU (10mg) is needed to restore vitamin D levels in each case

&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps just 200,000 IU (5mg) vitamin D would be enough - should know in the future

Retail Cost of capsules: $0.22 for 50,000 IU, $0.06 for 5,000 IU

Cost of the Vitamin D for 10,000 people for 3 months: 

Water: $300, Capsules $72,000

#### Give Vitamin D to Groups who are at high risk of COVID-19 infection

 **High Risk due to environment** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; health care workers, transit employees, teachers, prisons, quarantine centers, cruise ships, military

 **High Risk due to low vitamin D** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; dark skin, obese, diabetic, hypertension, immunocompromised

 **High Risk due to both reasons** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; slums, nursing homes

Need to find someone/some group willing to try something different 

Probably areas with big COVID-19 outbreaks

* might be more anxious to try something new: US, Brazil, India

* especially if it has the potential to make a big difference and while being low cost and low risk

Probably need ~10,000 people taking Vitamin D

Want to divide the 10,000 people into say 10 groups, so as to be able to separate out a group which might contain a superspreader event
