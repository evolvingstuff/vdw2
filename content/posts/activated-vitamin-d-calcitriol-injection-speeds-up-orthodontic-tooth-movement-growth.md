Purpose: The study focuses on the role of Vitamin D in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. Vitamin D is a potent stimulator of osteoclastic activity by promoting the recruitment of osteoclast precursors in bone remodeling. In addition, the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency is high, so it is important to investigate the clinical application of these findings, including the potential use of Vitamin D metabolites to enhance the rate of tooth movement during orthodontic treatment.

Materials and Methods: 3 databases were searched: Scopus, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. The search resulted in 42 publications from databases. 7 studies were included in the qualitative analysis.

Conclusions: The majority of studies showed the locally injected calcitriol to be clinically efficient and cost effective reducing the overall treatment time also it was found initially there was an increase in osteoclastic activity followed by osteoblastic activity, this was also evidenced by several laboratory-based investigations and questionnaire-based assessments pertaining to Vitamin D.
