The role of vitamin D supplementation in preventing multiple sclerosis (MS) and/or treating MS progression is an area of significant research interest. We detail the current status of the ongoing research in this field, and note the lack of class 1 evidence from well-conducted, large, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and/or treatment of MS. We have been able to  **provide some guidelines for practitioners**  based on the substantial burden of supportive evidence for the use of vitamin D in MS as summarised here. These guidelines may provide some support to those clinicians who treat people with MS and their families.

Cellular pathways of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in cell and gene regulation (after Simpson Greenhill 2011100). 

* (1) The 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are predominantly transported in plasma bound to vitamin D binding protein (VDBP). A small proportion (0.04% of 25(OH)D and 0.4% of 1,25(OH)2D) are transported unbound in the plasma and this fraction has traditionally been assumed to enter cells via passive diffusion. VDBP-bound 25(OH)D is now recognized to be internalized via receptor-mediated membrane transport. 

* (2) Once in the cell, 25(OH)D is transported to the mitochondria where it undergoes hydroxylation to 1,25(OH)2D; 1,25(OH)2D can also enter the cell directly. 

* (3) The movement of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D from the cell membrane to their intracellular destinations is a highly ordered process involving a chain of intracellular vitamin D binding proteins (IDBP). 

* (4) Non-genomic effects occur on binding of 1,25(OH)2D to the cell membrane vitamin D receptor (VDR) and take place at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. 

* (5) Genomic effects of 1,25(OH)2D primarily occur within the cell nucleus. The VDR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and this complex preferentially binds 1,25(OH)2D. The resulting complex binds vitamin D response element (VDRE) on target genes, resulting in dissociation of corepressor (CoR) protein and recruitment of coactivator (CoA) proteins. The VDRâ€“CoA interaction facilitates recruitment of mediator complexes (MC) that build a bridge between the VDRE and the transcription machinery to affect expression of multiple genes. 

* (6) The 25(OH) D and 1,25(OH)2D are catabolized by the enzyme vitamin D-24-hydroxylase (24OHase) to the inactive, water-soluble form 24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (24,25(OH)2D) for renal excretion.
