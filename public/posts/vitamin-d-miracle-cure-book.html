He and his wife Wendy live in their RV and travel the US and Canada. He is author of the Vitamin D Tales, a series of books presenting current information on vitamin D topics and case studies on the successful prevention and treatment of a wide variety of diseases and conditions with vitamin D. Warren blogs on his travels at <a href=http://muddscape.wordpress.com>http://muddscape.wordpress.com</a>.

Henry, an Engineer retired from Boeing, and his wife Judy live in their RV, traveling the US from their home base near Seattle Washington. Henry publishes daily research updates, summaries, hypotheses, and observations to the wiki at <a href=https://www.VitaminDWiki.com>https://www.VitaminDWiki.com</a></p><h2 id=1-vitamin-d-comes-of-age>1 VITAMIN D COMES OF AGE</h2><p>Vitamin D seems to be on the tongue and page of nearly every advertiser. This in itself isn&rsquo;t a big revelation. It has happened before with many everyday nutrients such as vitamin E, melatonin, fish oil, carbohydrates, fat, and even high tech discoveries such as carbon nanotubes. What makes something like vitamin D suddenly popular is a growing public awareness that serves to focus the advertising message.</p><p>Public interest in vitamin D is rising because there is intense and growing activity in the research community on the functions and benefits of vitamin D. And that activity is producing some astonishing results. As these results become public, people who have been quietly and desperately suffering with health issues are finding vitamin D to be a remarkable solution for them. As their success stories become more public, the lingering suspicions that were planted by misinformation back in the 1950&rsquo;s are fading.</p><p>Vitamin D Tales is a series of stories about those sufferers and how they have found a solution in vitamin D. Their tales help to illustrate what a little concrete, scientific knowledge can do to dramatically improve a life. Each story is linked to relevant research and structured studies with evidence and findings. One such tale, Autism and Vitamin D — Emily&rsquo;s Story, is already published and available as an e-book on Amazon.com (Kindle) and BarnesandNoble.com (Nook).</p><p>The books in this series draw from real case studies and accounts related directly from patients and caretakers. These stories are told in a manner that makes them extremely readable. The scientific and medical jargon is reduced and replaced with everyday expressions and words to translate better into everyday lives and experiences. And the lessons learned in every case study are presented as a &ldquo;How To&rdquo; for you, the reader, to take away as a workable plan for treatment.</p><h2 id=2-a-brief-history>2 A BRIEF HISTORY</h2><p>In the early 1800&rsquo;s, cod liver oil and exposure of skin to sunlight were the accepted treatments for rickets, a severe bone-deforming disease seen mostly in children. In 1922, the common element in exposed skin and cod liver oil that was thought to be the active treatment agent was identified and named as vitamin D. For many years since, vitamin D has been known to have an important role in influencing healthy bone structure by controlling the flow of calcium into and out of bones through the bloodstream.</p><p>In the 1950&rsquo;s a common belief grew among medical and scientific professionals that vitamin D was a dangerous substance. This belief stemmed from a study done on a milk problem in England that falsely indicted vitamin D, and it has persisted as truth ever since.</p><p>Also, because it was fat-soluble and collected in the fatty tissues of our bodies, it was commonly believed that it could be accumulated to toxic levels if taken in high doses. This belief wasn&rsquo;t founded on scientific research or medical evidence, only a suspicion, common at the time, that any substance that was fat soluble was potentially very bad for the body. This was also the age of discovery that DDT, a chemical widely used as an agricultural pest control, was accumulating in the fat of food chain animals and was causing havoc in the destruction of populations of animals at the tops of those food chains. The Bald Eagle and North American Condor are good examples. It is likely that the hysteria and misinformation surrounding fat soluble vitamins was linked to concerns and very high levels of publicity regarding substances like DDT.</p><p>The erroneous study in England, and the widespread beliefs regarding fat soluble supplements, led the scientific and medical communities to put very public warnings out to avoid &ldquo;dangerous toxicity&rdquo; by over-consuming vitamin D. Safe levels of consumption were set extremely low without any true research or evidence to support them. There wasn&rsquo;t an argument that vitamin D was needed, just an error in determining the correct quantities. In fact, milk bought at the supermarket in the US (and a few other countries) has been fortified with vitamin D for decades, just in very small quantities. This is an artifact of the widespread practice of preventing rickets by treating children with cod liver oil or other vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>Vitamin D is actually a steroidal hormone like estrogen or testosterone. It stands alone as the only &lsquo;vitamin&rsquo; the body can produce on its own. Vitamin D is needed by the body to properly use other substances like calcium, magnesium, zinc and boron to build and maintain healthy tissue, skin, bone, teeth, and nerves. Vitamin D is called the &ldquo;Sunshine Vitamin&rdquo; because the body naturally produces it through exposure of your skin to the sun. A healthy young light-skinned person can generate up to 12,000 IU of vitamin D with just 20 minutes of sufficient bare skin exposure to a strong noon day sun under good conditions. So, it seems highly unlikely that consumption of more than 400 IU per day, the current suggested daily allowance, would be toxic. But this is exactly what the public has been told for 6 decades: avoid vitamin D in large doses because it can kill you.</p><p>In fact, this is patently untrue for vitamin D. While, like practically any substance (even water!), toxic levels can be reached in the body, it is difficult if not impossible to achieve toxicity without conscious effort. But it is just as equally true that the population of the US, and in most of the rest of the world as well, is becoming deficient in vitamin D at epidemic levels. You are at least 500 times (perhaps even much greater) more likely to die of an overdose of aspirin than vitamin D. There are approximately 500 deaths due to aspirin overdose in a year in the US versus zero reported vitamin D deaths in 20 years.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency (less than 10 ng/ml of blood) and insufficiency (10-20 ng/ml) have been linked directly to increases in disease and disorders that are now considered &ldquo;modern&rdquo; like autism, depression, osteoporosis, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, to mention just a few.</p><p>Many of our lifestyle changes in the last 50 years have contributed to low levels of vitamin D:</p><ul><li><p>Air conditioning has resulted in a larger percentage of our time spent inside, both at home and in office jobs.</p></li><li><p>Growing cities have reduced our time outside, and today most people on the planet live in cities.</p></li><li><p>With increasingly diverse populations and global integration, darker skinned persons are now living farther from the equator where their skin pigments had evolved to protect them from sun over-exposure Their dark skin thus over-protects them from producing vitamin D with less available sunlight.</p></li></ul></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1749775594"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1749775594",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1749775594"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1749775594"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1749775594"></script></body></html>
