#### EXCLUSIVE: Whatever happened to Pfizer's covid vaccine trial in pregnant women?

 **[Substack - Feb 23](https://maryannedemasi.substack.com/p/exclusive-whatever-happened-to-pfizers)** 

Trial with **<span style="color:orange;"> pregnant rats</span>:** 

""The study found the vaccine led to a  **statistically significant  <span style="color:orange;">doubling</span> in fetal loss** (9.77% mRNA vs 4.09% saline), but Pfizer concluded that the difference between the two groups was “not biologically meaningful.”

* "Unlike Pfizer, Moderna kept its pregnant rodents alive to test the embryos. Documents accessed by Judicial Watch, showed a “statistically significant” number of rats were born with skeletal variations after being injected with Moderna’s mRNA vaccine."

* "But Moderna concluded that the "Skeletal variations are structural changes that do not impact development or function of a developing embryo” and therefore “not considered adverse.”

!!!!EXCLUSIVE: Whatever happened to Pfizer&#39;s covid vaccine trial in pregnant women?
__[https://maryannedemasi.substack.com/p/exclusive-whatever-happened-to-pfizers|Substack - Feb 23]__
Trial with__~~#F00: pregnant rats~~:__
&quot;&quot;The study found the vaccine led to a __statistically significant ~~#F00:doubling~~ in fetal loss __(9.77% mRNA vs 4.09% saline), but Pfizer concluded that the difference between the two groups was “not biologically meaningful.”

*&quot;Unlike Pfizer, Moderna kept its pregnant rodents alive to test the embryos. Documents accessed by Judicial Watch, showed a “statistically significant” number of rats were born with skeletal variations after being injected with Moderna’s mRNA vaccine.&quot;
*&quot;But Moderna concluded that the &quot;Skeletal variations are structural changes that do not impact development or function of a developing embryo” and therefore “not considered adverse.”
