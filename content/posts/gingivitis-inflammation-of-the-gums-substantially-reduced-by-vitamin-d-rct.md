Introduction:

Vitamin D deficiency increases gingivitis risk. Studies show that higher vitamin D levels reduce inflammation.

Materials and Methods:

College conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial on 451 people’s vitamin D and gingival health at baseline. For three months, participants were given a placebo (group A), 1000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 per day (group B), 500 IU per day (group C), or 2000 IU per day (group A). Gingival scores were recorded for three months to assess the anti-inflammatory effect (the first, second, and third). Vitamin D levels also affected gingivitis.

Results:

Vitamin D dose-dependently reduces gingivitis inflammation. Vitamin D administration negatively correlated with gingival index score. Anti-inflammatory vitamin D levels are 32–37 ng/ml.

Conclusion:

Vitamin D supplementation can reduce gingivitis severity. The optimal blood vitamin D level is 30–35 ng/ml.
