#### [New STD cases hit record high in US, CDC says](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/26/health/std-highest-ever-reported-cdc/index.html)

* “In 2016, Americans were infected with more than 2 million new cases of  **gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia** , the highest number of these sexually transmitted diseases ever reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday”

* “ **Only those three STDs are required by law to be reported to the CDC by physicians** . When you include  **HIV, herpes**  and more of the dozens of diseases which can be transmitted sexually but which are not tracked, the CDC estimates there are  **more than 20 million new cases of STDs in the United States each year** . At least half occur in young people ages 15 to 24. ”

* syphilis, a long-forgotten disease (like rickets) increased 19% in one year (2015-2016)

* "For the first time in many years, we are now seeing more cases of babies born with congenital syphilis than babies born with HIV,”
