## Highlights of 80 minute video  from India Spring 2012 (unable to find link in July)

### &nbsp; &nbsp;[CLICK HERE to see video uploaded to a Public DropBox](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7721630/Holick%20India%20Spring%202012.flv)

* <a href="/posts/schizophrenia" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2985">Schizophrenia</a> is one of the many diseases Dr. Holick believes can be prevented with vitamin D

* <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-test" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 266">Vitamin D test</a> is the most ordered blood test in the US {2011?}

* Is your infant vitamin D deficient? Best symptom =  head sweating at night

> Note: there are many other [possible causes for head sweating](http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/symptoms/night_sweats_in_children/causes.htm)

* 750,000 pet reptiles purchased in the US annually – majority do not get vitamin D

> Holick bought a <a href="/posts/40-uvb-bulb" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 982">$40 UVB bulb</a> for his daughter’s pet iguana

* Komono dragons given to US were kept behind windows  were not [fertile](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=65&sort_mode=created_desc%20) (no vitamin D)

> After getting UVB they became fertile <a href="/posts/vet-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 17">Vet and Vitamin D</a>

* Indians and Pakistani (<a href="/posts/dark-skin" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1064">dark skin</a>) need 3X-5X as much UVB to make as much vitamin D.  See also: <a href="/posts/middle-east-and-low-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1758">Middle East and low Vitamin D</a>

* 70% reduction in the ability of <a href="/posts/70-year-olds" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 28">70 year-olds</a> to make vitamin D from the sun

* [Toxicity](/categories/toxicity) not a worry until > 150 nanograms

* <a href="/posts/iom-error" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1806">IoM error</a> disagreed with the author of the study

> IoM said 20 ng, should have been 30 nanograms

* Even with failed kidney a person can still take vitamin D 

> Vitamin D is also converted in other parts of the body

> Holick typically gives 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks as a [loading dose](/categories/loading-dose)

* Every tissue in the body has a vitamin D receptor – must be for some reason

* Higher latitude ==> <a href="/posts/higher-blood-pressure" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1171">higher blood pressure</a>

* People who work in the sun have LESS melanoma {Perhaps because they do not get sunburn}

* Melanoma occurs on the LEAST exposed portions of the skin

* Should not treat patients with the active form of vitamin D (for example if they have Kidney failure)

> It has a half life of only 4 hours

> It actually lowers the level of vitamin D in the blood ( by making it water soluble)

## Dr. Holick did not mention in this video

* Vitamin D can <a href="/posts/treat-some-diseases" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1886">treat some diseases</a> as well as <a href="/posts/proven-to-prevent" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1336">proven to prevent</a> many diseases

* The <a href="/posts/reasons-for-vitamin-d-deficiency" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1586">reasons for vitamin D deficiency</a>

> Holick seems unaware that vitamin D had been in the (human/carnivore) diet

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;meat from wild animals, “<a href="/posts/free-range-lard" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1414">free range lard</a>”, organ meats, oily fish, etc.

> <a href="/posts/free-range-eggs-have-4x-as-much-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1975">Free range eggs have 4X as much vitamin D</a>

> <a href="/posts/a-plea-for-vit-d-food-fortification-in-india" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 209">A plea for vit D food fortification in  **India** May 2010</a>

* Perhaps 1 in 300 people have an <a href="/posts/allergic-reaction-to-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2433">allergic reaction to vitamin D</a> – which should be tested for before massive loading dose of vitamin D

* There are <a href="/posts/many-reasons-to-take-vitamin-d3-and-not-d2" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2138">many reasons to take vitamin D3 and not D2</a>

>  **Especially**  if the vitamin D supplement is not taken daily (D2 has a much shorter half-life0

* <a href="/posts/cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">Cofactors</a> very important for vitamin D: from the sun and/or supplements

### People may not continue with a change (supplement vitamin D) if they lack immediate positive feedback

The positive feedback resulting in <a href="/posts/pain-reduction" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2462">pain reduction</a>, far fewer [cold/flu](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=35&sort_mode=created_desc), etc does not appear to start until >2,000 IU daily
