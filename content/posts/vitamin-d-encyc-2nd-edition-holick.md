## Description of book on Amazon

In Vitamin D: Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Clinical Applications, Second Edition, leading researchers provide a comprehensive, highly readable overview of the biological functions and clinical applications of vitamin D and its metabolites. 

Topics range from the most recent recommendations for vitamin D intake to new approaches for the treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency and the development of active vitamin D drugs to treat psoriasis and cancer. 

The book demonstrates the significant role that vitamin D has in maintaining good bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis, an important health problem for adults over the age of fifty. 

In addition, it authoritatively reviews the 

* relationship between sunlight exposure, vitamin D, and increased risk of colon and breast cancer; 

* how vitamin D is made in the skin; and 

* the sequence of events that leads to its activation by the kidney. 

Also examined are the biological functions of 1,25-dihydrovitamin D3 on 

* the intestine and bone, as well as 

* other tissues, such as 

> skin, the 

> immune system, 

> prostate, and 

> breast, and 

* vitamin D's molecular mechanism of action on the cell membrane and nucleus.

The first edition of Vitamin D: Physiology, Molecular Biology and Clinical Applications was the benchmark in the field when published in 1999. 

This new and expanded volume continues to include extensive, in-depth chapters covering the most important aspects of the complex interactions between vitamin D and other dietary components, the ongoing debate concerning the best indicator of optimal vitamin D status and its nutrient requirements, and the impact of less than optimal status on disease risk. 

Vitamin D: Physiology, Molecular Biology, and Clinical Applications, Second Edition is designed and organized not only to be an up-to-date review on the subject, but also to provide medical students, graduate students, health care professionals and even the lay public with a reference source for the most up-to-date information about the vitamin D deficiency pandemic and its clinical implications for health and disease.
