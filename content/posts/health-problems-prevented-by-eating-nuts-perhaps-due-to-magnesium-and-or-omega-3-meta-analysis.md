#### Nut consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies

Background

Although nut consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, data on less common causes of death has not been systematically assessed. Previous reviews missed several studies and additional studies have since been published. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of nut consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Methods

PubMed and Embase were searched for prospective studies of nut consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adult populations published up to July 19, 2016. Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. The burden of mortality attributable to low nut consumption was calculated for selected regions.

Results

Twenty studies (29 publications) were included in the meta-analysis. 

The summary RRs per 28 grams/day increase in nut intake was for

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Problem | Risk<br> Reduction | Statistics | 1. of studies |
| coronary heart disease | 0.71  | 95% CI: 0.63–0.80, I2 = 47% | n = 11 |
| stroke | 0.93  | 95% CI: 0.83–1.05, I2 = 14%  | n = 11 |
| cardiovascular disease | 0.79  | 95% CI: 0.70–0.88, I2 = 60% | n = 12 |
| total cancer | 0.85  | 95% CI: 0.76–0.94, I2 = 42% | n = 8 |
| all-cause mortality | 0.78  | 95% CI: 0.72–0.84, I2 = 66% | n = 15 |
| mortality from respiratory disease | 0.48  | 95% CI: 0.26–0.89, I2 = 61% | n = 3 |
| mortality from diabetes | 0.61  | 95% CI: 0.43–0.88, I2 = 0% | n = 4 |
| mortality from neurodegenerative disease | 0.65  | 95% CI: 0.40–1.08, I2 = 5.9% | n = 3 |
| mortality from infectious disease | 0.25  | 95% CI: 0.07–0.85, I2 = 54% | n = 2 |
| mortality from kidney disease | 0.27  | 95% CI: 0.04–1.91, I2 = 61% | n = 2 |

The results were similar for tree nuts and peanuts. 

If the associations are causal, an estimated  **4.4 million premature deaths**  in the America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific would be attributable to a nut intake below 20 grams per day in 2013.

Conclusion

Higher nut intake is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-cause mortality, and mortality from respiratory disease, diabetes, and infections.

### Note: some of the benefit found may be due to healthier living/eating which is associated with eating nuts

#### Note: founder of VitaminDWiki daily

* Eat 100+ grams of nuts and dried fruit

* Take ~100 milligrams of Magnesium orally - pill or Magnesium Chloride liquid 

* Apply Magnesium Chloride topically (with DMSO - which has eliminated my [knee osteoarthritis](/posts/i-needed-more-than-vitamin-d-to-treat-my-knee-osteoarthritis) )

* Take [Omega-3](/posts/i-use-vectomega-brand-of-omega-3-admin-of-vitamindwiki)
