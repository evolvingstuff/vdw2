BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The debate surrounding recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in middle-aged patients (that is, 20–60 years of age) with low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is growing. Our aim was to describe practices regarding vitamin D supplementation in this age group, which are basically unknown.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: We performed an analysis using exhaustive reimbursement data from the individuals in Rhône-Alpes area, a French region regrouping more than 6 million of inhabitants. The data were collected from the French Insurance Health-care System. Patients who were 20–60 years of age, had no severe comorbidities, had a 25(OH)D assay between 1 December 2008 and 31 January 2009 were identified. Those who received a subsequent prescription for vitamin D were included in this analysis. We described patterns of vitamin D supplementation by frequency and daily dose.

RESULTS: The sample in this study included 1311 patients. The mean age was 47.7 years (s.d.: 9.5) and the median age was 50.2 years. 

Most of the participants (that is, 85.9%) were women. 

 **Total of 372 distinct prescription patterns for vitamin D supplementation**  were observed. 

The two most frequent (that is, 32.6% in total) involved a unique dispensation of a high dose of either 

* 200 000 (17.5%) or 

* 100 000 IU (15.1%). 

Most prescribed supplements were based on vitamin D3 (65%), and the 

* most prescribed forms were high dose ampoules (81.6%). 

* Only 48.9% of the participants were given a maintenance prescription after the initial loading phase.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a significant variability in the prescriptions for vitamin D supplementation from physicians in the French population. 

 **Moreover, less than half of the patients receive maintenance therapy after the initial loading phase of supplementation.**
