The number of dairy cows without access to pasture or sunlight is increasing; therefore, the content of vitamin D in dairy products is decreasing. Ultimately, declining vitamin D levels in dairy products will mean that dairy products are a negligible source of natural vitamin D for humans. We tested the ability of a specially designed UVB lamp to enhance the vitamin D3 content in milk from dairy cows housed indoors. This study included 16 cows divided into 4 groups.

Each group was exposed daily to artificial UVB light simulating 1, 2, 3, or 4 h of summer sun at 56°N for 24 d, and the group with simulated exposure to 2 h of summer sun daily continued to be monitored for 73 d. We found a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) levels in plasma as well as vitamin D3 and 25OHD3 levels in milk after daily exposure for 24 d in all treatment groups. Extending daily exposure to artificial UVB light to 73 d did not lead to an increase of vitamin D3 or 25OHD3 level in the milk. In conclusion, the change in production facilities for dairy cows providing cows with no access to pasture and sunlight causes a decrease of vitamin D levels in dairy products. This decrease may be prevented by exposing cows to artificial UVB light in the stable.

> Abstract: The main goal of this study was to establish the content of vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), vitamin D2, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) in dairy products. Composite samples of milk, cream, and butter (1.5–80% fat), and organic milk (3.5% fat) were analyzed. Each composite sample was sampled over 3 months and the sample comprised 12 units (range 8–14). The average content of vitamin D3 and 25OHD3 were 4.6–196 ng/100 g and 4.2–96 ng/100 g, respectively. For vitamin D2 the values, in milk and butter, were 3.4 and 61 ng/100 g, respectively, and for 25OHD2 they were 3.1 and 58 ng/100 g, respectively. Statistically significant effects of food product (p < 0.0001) and season (p < 0.05) on the content of vitamin D3 and 25OHD3 were shown. Vitamin D3 and 25OHD3 were significantly associated with fat (R = 0.88, p < 0.0001 and R = 0.96, p < 0.0001, respectively). Differences were observed between organically and conventionally produced milk. Implementation of these values into Food Databanks has to be done carefully, due in part to a lack of consensus on the relative bioactivity between the vitamin D active compounds, and partly because quantification of dihydroxy vitamin D compounds were not included in this study.
