Background:Despite considerable interest, the relationship between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of hip fracture is not fully established.

Objective:To study the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (s-25(OH)D) and risk of hip fracture in Norway, a high-latitude country that has among the highest hip fracture rates worldwide.

Methods:N=21,774 men and women aged 65-79 attended four community-based health studies during 1994-2001. Information on subsequent hip fractures were retrieved from electronic hospital discharge registers, with maximum follow-up 10.7 years. Using a stratified case-cohort design, s-25(OH)D was determined by HPLC-APCI-MS in stored serum samples in hip fracture cases (n=1175; 307 men, 868 women) and in gender-stratified random samples (n=1438). Cox proportional hazards regression adapted for the case-cohort design was performed.

Results: We observed an inverse association between s-25(OH)D and hip fracture; those with s-25(OH)D in the lowest quartile (<42.2 nmol/l) had a 38% (95% CI 9-74%) increased risk of hip fracture compared with the highest quartile (>=67.9 nmol/l) in a model accounting for age, gender, study center, and BMI. The association was stronger in men than in women:  **HR 1.65**  (95% CI 1.04-2.61) versus HR 1.25 (95% CI 0.95-1.65).

Conclusion: In this prospective case-cohort study of hip fractures, the largest ever reported, we found an increased risk of hip fracture in subjects in the lowest compared to the highest quartile of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. In accordance with findings of previous community-based studies, low vitamin D status was a modest risk factor for hip fracture.
