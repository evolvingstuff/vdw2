 **What is the recommended diet for the Coimbra Protocol?** 

The diet restrictions are related exclusively to the amount of calcium the foods contain. Dairy and calcium enriched foods must be avoided, nuts should be consumed in moderation. Again, every patient is different, so the test results will ultimately determine if the diet is being correctly followed or if more restrictions are needed. Also, patients need to drink 2.5 L of liquids a day, to ensure that the kidneys will be able to eliminate excess calcium without difficulty.
