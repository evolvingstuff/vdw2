 **Summary** 

* Recommends daily dosing without any initial dosing

   * VitaminDWiki and most Randomized Controlled Trials for COVID-19 disagree (see bottom of page)

* Recommends daily dosing of 400-1000 IU - unlikely to make any difference

   * Yet allows that some participants will be taking 800 IU of vitamin D 

      * Would be very difficult to determine if 400 IU helps if some are getting 800 IU

* Recommends 4-12 month trials

   * Unlikely that such low doses will have any benefit in <6 months

#### Many clinical trials are underway which are testing Vitamin D to fight COVID-19
