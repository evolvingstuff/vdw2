PURPOSE OF REVIEW:

The role of vitamin D beyond its importance for bone health is under much debate. In this article, we review recent evidence for genetic influences on 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and discuss the uses of this information and its importance for public health.

RECENT FINDINGS:

Findings from large-scale genome-wide association meta-analyses on 25(OH)D confirmed the associations for loci nearby genes encoding 

* vitamin D binding protein (GC, group component), 

* 7-dehydrochlesterol reductase (DHCR7), 

* 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1) and 

* 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), 

all influencing key sites for vitamin D metabolism. Findings from candidate gene studies have been inconsistent, with some implicating an association with 25(OH)D for loci near the gene encoding the hormonal vitamin D activation enzyme (CYP27B1).

SUMMARY:

The amount of variation in 25(OH)D explained by  **genetic determinants is small compared with environmental exposures** . 

Information on genetic variants affecting 25(OH)D can be used as tools for Mendelian randomization analyses on vitamin D, and they provide some potential for the use as drug targets.
