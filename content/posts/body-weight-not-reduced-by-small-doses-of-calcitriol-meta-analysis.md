Background & Aims

Obesity is associated with vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. However, previous studies showed mixed effects of VitD (25-hydroxyVitD/calcidiol) supplementation on body weight. The biological actions of VitD require the hydroxylation of inactive VitD into active VitD (1.25-dihydroxyVitD/calcitriol). This step is highly regulated; therefore, supplementing with inactive VitD might not be sufficient to overcome the potential adverse health effects of VitD deficiency. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of data acquired from randomised placebo-controlled calcitriol trials (RCTs) to determine the effects of calcitriol on body weight and weight-related parameters.

Methods

Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases up to January 27, 2024, and excluded those involving dialysis or cancer patients. We obtained IPD from eligible trials and assessed bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool and methodological quality using the Heyland Methodological Quality Score. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017076202).

Results

Although none of the studies reported information regarding our primary objective, we obtained IPD for 411 patients, with 206 randomised to receive calcitriol and 205 to placebo. This dataset enabled us to conduct an IPD meta-analysis with 17,084 person-months of follow-up (median: 11 months). Meta-analysis showed that calcitriol does not alter body weight, BMI, waist circumference, fat mass or lean body mass compared to placebo. Adjusting for age and sex did not alter the outcomes.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this systematic review and IPD meta-analysis indicate that calcitriol does not affect body weight in normal-weight postmenopausal women and lean patients with type 1 diabetes nor in people suffering from obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Whether calcitriol lowers body weight in VitD-sufficient people with obesity remains to be elucidated.
