### [First case of vitamin D toxicity](http://www.secondopinionnewsletter.com/Health-Alert-Archive/View-Archive/12179/First-case-of-vitamin-D-toxicity.htm)

 **Clips from the post** 

* A 67-year-old woman went to the hospital with a history of lethargy, memory impairment, confusion, loss of appetite, and loss of equilibrium for two-weeks duration. 

* Her routine biochemistry showed elevated blood calcium at 14 mg/dl.  This is dangerously high. *The doctors then checked her vitamin D level and it was also extremely high at 254 ng/ml.

* . . all of this woman’s lab tests including her liver tests, lipids, thyroid panel, and blood counts were completely normal. (other than Calcium)

* it took a full six months for her levels to come down to 66 ng/ml.

* If you notice any symptoms of calcium overload (extreme tiredness, bone and muscle pain, and increased thirst), cut back on how often you take it. You’ll soon be back to normal.
