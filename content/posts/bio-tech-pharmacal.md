I have been very happily using [ **<span style="color:#00F;">Vitamin D capsules from Bio-Tech Pharmacal</span>** ](http://www.biotechpharmacal.com/catalog/category/vitamin-d/) for the past several years.

The reasons I strongly believe that you should consider Bio-Tech are:

1.  **Lowest cost for 50,000 IU vitamin D capsule** 

> I put a yellow colored dot on my desk calendar once every 4 days in the winter, 

> when the day has that dot on it I take the capsule. And remove the dot

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I realize that most people take supplements daily, but dots my method

1.  **They have a great set of Vitamin D products** 

> They produce high quality products

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Versus I have seen various reports of other supplies with less in the capsule than on the label and contaminates

> Freshness is designed into their product, whereas several other vitamin D products go rancid

> They worked with Vitamin D Council to produce [D3 Plus](http://www.biotechpharmacal.com/catalog/d3plus/) which adds Magnesium, Vitamins K1 and K2

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Description of D3 Plus by Dr. Cannell of Vitamin D Council](http://www.biotechpharmacal.com/2012/08/d3plusthe-only-vitamin-d-on-the-market-endorsed-by-the-vitamin-d-council/) 

1.  **They actively support vitamin D** 

> They provide free vitamin D to scores of clinical trials around the world, providing placebo capsules as well as the real stuff

> They help fund Vitamin D websites such as 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>[www.VitaminDWiki.com]</span>,&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>[www.vitamindcouncil.org]</span>,&nbsp; &nbsp;  and <span>[www.grassrootshealth.net]</span>

> They have gotten many pharmacies around the world to stock Vitamin D3 (not just D2)

> They have totally funded the [Vitamin D Video being produced](/tags/vitamin-d-video-being-produced.html)

> They want to work with VitaminDWiki at making a Vitamin D + Magnesium supplement

> They are supporting my efforts at creating a “vitamin D (salt) shaker”

> They will probably support my efforts at [“Home fortification of Vitamin D”](/tags/home-fortification-of-vitamin-d.html)

I have had extensive conversations with the owner. Dale

Dale is extremely interested in improving health around the world, as I am 

Available directly from  [BioTech](http://www.biotechpharmacal.com/catalog/category/vitamin-d/) (which ships around the world), as well as a great many pharmacies, health supplement websites and, of course, 

Amazon: [US](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&field-keywords=bio-tech+d3&rh=n%3A3760901%2Ck%3Abio-tech+d3) &nbsp; &nbsp;[UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Ddrugstore&field-keywords=bio-tech%20d3)&nbsp; &nbsp;[Australia](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&field-keywords=bio-tech+d3) which has the advantage of low cost and no cost for shipping if your are a Prime member, 

but apparently NO Amazon site ships any health related product out of the country.
