Background: Studies on the association between Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism and gestational diabetes mellitus have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to summarize available evidence on the association between polymorphisms of Vitamin D receptor genes and susceptibility to gestational diabetes mellitus. 

Methods: We searched databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), China science and technology journal database (VIP), and Wanfang Data for relevant articles. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were done to compare the distribution of Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in gestational diabetes mellitus patients with those in controls using allelic, codominant, dominant, and recessive models. 

Results: A total of eight eligible articles were included in the systematic review and of them, six articles were included in the meta-analysis. The vitamin D receptor gene rs7975232 polymorphism was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus under the allelic model (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.56), codominant model (CC vs. AA odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.28–3.05), and recessive model (odds ratio = 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.27–2.64) in the case of low heterogeneity. High heterogeneity existed in studies on the association of vitamin D receptor genes rs1544410, rs2228570, and rs731236 with gestational diabetes mellitus, and the most common sources of heterogeneity were the year of publication and matching. 

Conclusion: Polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor gene rs7975232 may be associated with risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus. Future studies should be designed to include standardized data collection and matching for important confounding factors such as body mass index, age, and race.

#### The role of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in gestational diabetes mellitus susceptibility: a meta-analysis - Dec 2021

Diabetol Metab Syndr . 2021 Dec 13;13(1):144. [doi: 10.1186/s13098-021-00764-y.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-021-00764-y.)

Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common disease during pregnancy. The association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms with GDM is still controversial. This study aimed to assess the associations between VDR polymorphisms and GDM risk.

Methods: We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase electronic database for all eligible studies published from Jan 1, 1980 to December 31, 2020 to conduct a Meta-analysis. We analyzed four VDR polymorphisms: BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), TaqI (rs731236), and FokI (rs2228570).

Inclusion criteria: (1) The data can be evaluated; (2) case-control study; and (3) meeting the Hardy-Weinberg's law.

Exclusion criteria: (1) Insufficient or extractable data; (2) Severe publication bias in the data; and (3) duplicate publications. We eventually included 15 studies in seven articles, including 2207 cases and 2706 controls.

Results: We eventually included 15 studies in seven articles, including 2207 cases and 2706 controls. The data showed that ApaI (rs7975232) VDR gene polymorphism was related with the risk of GDM for the comparison of CC vs AA and recessive model in overall population and FokI (rs2228570) VDR gene polymorphism was associated with the risk of GDM for recessive model in overall population. BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism was not related with the risk of GDM in overall population. However, in the analysis of subgroups grouped by race, BsmI (rs1544410) has certain correlations. And, the data suggested the TaqI (rs731236) polymorphism was not associated with GDM.

Conclusion: Based on the meta-analysis, VDR ApaI (rs7975232) and FokI (rs2228570) polymorphisms increase susceptibility to GDM. In the future, it can be used to diagnose and screen molecular biomarkers for GDM patients.
