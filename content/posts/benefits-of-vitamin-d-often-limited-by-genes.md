Vitamin D  (Cholecalciferol  in blood, fat, breast milk)

Processing by Liver into 'Calcidiol is limited by

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color:#00F;">CYP24A1 gene</span>

Outside of the liver Calcidiol'  production is limited by

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="color:#00F;">CYP2R1 gene</span>

 **<span style="color:#F00;">Measured Vit D</span>**  = Calcidiol

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  **the following genes are invisible to vit D test** 

Only a portion of Calcidiol is bio-available

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the rest is tied up by  **Vit D Binding Protein**  = GC

Kidney excreting = Calcidiol

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is a function of  **CYP24A1 gene**   

Active Vit D  (from Kidney etc.) = Calcitriol

Vitamin D availability in the cells

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is a function of  **Vit D receptor gene**

It seems that ~30% of the people do not get full benefit from Vitamin D due to <span style="color:#00F;">gene limitations</span>

It seems that  **<span style="color:#00F;">20% of limitations due to genes are invisible</span>**  to Vitamin D blood tests
