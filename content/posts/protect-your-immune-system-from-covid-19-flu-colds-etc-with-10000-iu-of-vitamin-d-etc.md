 **Vitamin D3: 10,000 IU/Day Adults Minimum | 2000-5000 IU/Day Children** 

"While the sun is one of the best sources of vitamin D, most people spend less time outdoors during the winter monthsâ€”AKA, the cold and flu season. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin D helps support a healthy respiratory system and protect against acute respiratory infections like ARDS and pneumonia. Other research suggests that vitamin D may also help mitigate symptoms of the flu and other influenza-like illnesses."
