# Estimate of a predictive cut-off value for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflecting abdominal obesity in Korean adolescents.

Vitamin D deficiency is a serious global issue. Although the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> test is generally the most accurate way to assess vitamin D levels, the optimal range of 25(OH)D has yet to be established. Moreover, the optimal level may vary according to race, region, and age. Suboptimal vitamin D status is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are the major risk factors for cardiovascular disorders; however, these relationships in children and adolescents have yet to be clearly determined. Therefore, we identified the best predictive cut-off value for reflecting abdominal obesity and, based on this value, we investigated the relationship between suboptimal 25(OH)D status and the risk for having abdominal obesity, being overweight or obese, and having metabolic syndrome in Korean adolescents. 

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 713 Korean adolescents, between 12-19 years of age, and used data collected from the 2008 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Receiver operation characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the cut-off value that reflected abdominal obesity. 

The cut-off value of serum 25(OH)D that reflected abdominal obesity in Korean adolescents was 17.6 ng/mL. 

After making adjustments for gender, age, and regular physical exercise, the group that had lower levels of serum 25(OH)D compared to the cut-off value had a significantly higher risk for abdominal obesity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome than the group with 25(OH)D levels higher than the cut-off value. 

Suboptimal vitamin D status based on this value is associated with increased risk for abdominal obesity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome among Korean adolescents.

!Estimate of a predictive cut-off value for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflecting abdominal obesity in Korean adolescents.

Vitamin D deficiency is a serious global issue. Although the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] test is generally the most accurate way to assess vitamin D levels, the optimal range of 25(OH)D has yet to be established. Moreover, the optimal level may vary according to race, region, and age. Suboptimal vitamin D status is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are the major risk factors for cardiovascular disorders; however, these relationships in children and adolescents have yet to be clearly determined. Therefore, we identified the best predictive cut-off value for reflecting abdominal obesity and, based on this value, we investigated the relationship between suboptimal 25(OH)D status and the risk for having abdominal obesity, being overweight or obese, and having metabolic syndrome in Korean adolescents. 

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 713 Korean adolescents, between 12-19 years of age, and used data collected from the 2008 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Receiver operation characteristic curve analysis was used to identify the cut-off value that reflected abdominal obesity. 

The cut-off value of serum 25(OH)D that reflected abdominal obesity in Korean adolescents was 17.6 ng/mL. 

After making adjustments for gender, age, and regular physical exercise, the group that had lower levels of serum 25(OH)D compared to the cut-off value had a significantly higher risk for abdominal obesity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome than the group with 25(OH)D levels higher than the cut-off value. 

Suboptimal vitamin D status based on this value is associated with increased risk for abdominal obesity, obesity, and metabolic syndrome among Korean adolescents.
