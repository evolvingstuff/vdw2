Objective

This study was performed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co- supplementation on glucose metabolism and lipid concentrations in gestational diabetes (GDM) patients.

Methods

This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was done among 140 GDM patients. Participants were randomly divided into four groups to receive: 

* 1) 1000 mg omega-3 fatty acids containing 360 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 240 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) twice a day+ vitamin D placebo (n=35); 

* 2) 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks+ omega-3 fatty acids placebo (n=35); 

* 3) 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks+1000 mg omega-3 fatty acids twice a day (n=35) and 

* 4) vitamin D placebo+omega-3 fatty acids placebo (n=35) for 6 weeks.

Results

After  **6 weeks of intervention** , patients who received combined vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids supplements compared with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and placebo had significantly decreased 

* fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-7.3±7.8, -6.9±6.6, -4.0±2.5 and +1.0±11.4 mg/dL, respectively, P<0.001), 

* serum insulin levels (-1.9±1.9, -1.3±6.3, -0.4±6.3 and +2.6±6.5 μIU/mL, respectively, P=0.005), 

* homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (-0.7±0.6, -0.5±1.4, -0.2±1.5 and +0.6±1.5, respectively, P<0.001) 

* increased quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (+0.01±0.01, +0.008±0.02, +0.002±0.02 and -0.005±0.02, respectively, P=0.001). In addition, changes in 

* serum triglycerides (-8.2±41.0, +7.6±31.5, +3.6±29.9 and +20.1±29.6 mg/dL, respectively, P=0.006) and 

* VLDL-cholesterol (-1.6±8.2, +1.5±6.3, +0.8±6.0 and +4.0±5.9 mg/dL, respectively, P=0.006) in the vitamin D plus omega-3 fatty acids group were significantly different from the changes in these indicators in the vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and placebo groups.

Conclusion

Overall, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementation for 6 weeks among GDM patients had beneficial effects on FPG, serum insulin levels, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, serum triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol levels.

Background

This study was carried out to determine the effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co- supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes (GDM) patients.

METHODS:

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 120 GDM women. 

Participants were randomly divided into four groups to receive: 

* 1) 1000 mg omega-3 fatty acids containing 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 120 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) twice a day + vitamin D placebo (n = 30); 

* 2) 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks + omega-3 fatty acids placebo (n = 30); 

* 3) 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks + 1000 mg omega-3 fatty acids twice a day (n = 30) and 

* 4) vitamin D placebo + omega-3 fatty acids placebo (n = 30) for 6 weeks.

Results

Subjects who received vitamin D plus omega-3 fatty acids supplements compared with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and placebo had significantly decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (−2.0 ± 3.3 vs. -0.8 ± 4.4, −1.3 ± 2.4 and +0.9 ± 2.7 mg/L, respectively, P = 0.008), malondialdehyde (−0.5 ± 0.5 vs. −0.2 ± 0.5, −0.3 ± 0.9 and +0.5 ± 1.4 μmol/L, respectively, P < 0.001), and increased total antioxidant capacity (+92.1 ± 70.1 vs. +55.1 ± 123.6, +88.4 ± 95.2 and +1.0 ± 90.8 mmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001) and glutathione (+95.7 ± 86.7 vs. +23.0 ± 62.3, +30.0 ± 66.5 and −7.8 ± 126.5 μmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001). In addition, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementation, compared with vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and placebo, resulted in lower incidences of newborns’ hyperbilirubinemiain (P = 0.037) and newborns’ hospitalization (P = 0.037).

Conclusion

Overall, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids co-supplementation for 6 weeks among GDM women had beneficial effects on some biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and pregnancy outcomes.
