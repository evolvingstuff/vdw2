&lt;p>INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism, FokI, is reported to increase the risk of many cancers. Role of vitamin D and its receptor polymorphisms in ovarian cancer has not been clearly defined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OBJECTIVE: To study the levels of serum vitamin D and occurrence of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism (FokI) in cases of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ovarian cancer: more likely to survive if more vitamin D</title><link>/posts/ovarian-cancer-more-likely-to-survive-if-more-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ovarian-cancer-more-likely-to-survive-if-more-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="25ohd3-in-patients-with-ovarian-cancer-and-its-correlation-with-survival">25(OH)D3 in patients with ovarian cancer and its correlation with survival&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Objectives&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The aim of this study was to examine vitamin 25(OH)D3 concentration in ovarian cancer patients in relation to a pathological subtype of the tumor, FIGO stage, grading, menopause status and overall 5-year survival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancers and Vitamin D Council</title><link>/posts/cancers-and-vitamin-d-council.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancers-and-vitamin-d-council.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ovarian Cancer is somewhat associated with a reduction in 20 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/ovarian-cancer-is-somewhat-associated-with-a-reduction-in-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ovarian-cancer-is-somewhat-associated-with-a-reduction-in-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="meta-analysis-circulating-vitamin-d-and-ovarian-cancer-risk">Meta-analysis: Circulating vitamin D and ovarian cancer risk.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize evidence from longitudinal studies on the association between circulating 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and the risk of ovarian cancer (OC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>METHODS: Relevant prospective cohort studies and nested case-control studies were identified by systematically searching Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases and by cross-referencing. The following data were extracted in a standardized manner from eligible studies: first author, publication year, country, study design, characteristics of the study population, duration of follow-up, OC incidence according to circulating vitamin D status and the respective relative risks, and covariates adjusted for in the analysis. Due to the heterogeneity of studies in categorizing circulating vitamin D levels, all results were recalculated for an increase of circulating 25(OH)D by 20ng/ml. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using meta-analysis methods.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
