BACKGROUND: Recently it has been suggested that, the worldwide increase in allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and food allergy is associated with low vitamin D intake.

OBJECTIVE: This study measured the vitamin D levels in patients with allergic rhinitis and compared the results with the general population.

METHODS:

Vitamin D levels were assessed in 50 patients with allergic rhinitis diagnosed clinically by Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma 2008 criteria and the result of skin prick test for aeroallergens. There was no control group, and the study results were compared with the results of another study evaluating vitamin D status in the 5,329 people of normal population of Iran.

RESULTS:

The prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in patients with allergic rhinitis than the normal population, 30% and 5.1% respectively (p = 0.03). Also women with allergic rhinitis had lower vitamin D levels.

CONCLUSION: Measuring vitamin D serum levels could be helpful in the routine assessment of patients with allergic rhinitis in Iran.

#### Severe Deficiency = 5ng  
Mean level for those with allergic rhinitis = 12.6 ng

Also attached below:  **Allergic rhinitis in the elderly not reduced by raising vitamin D to 40 ng** 

test only lasted 6 weeks

Study did NOT see if those > 40 ng got a benefit,

The study only looked at the average - with half > 40 ng and half < 40 ng
