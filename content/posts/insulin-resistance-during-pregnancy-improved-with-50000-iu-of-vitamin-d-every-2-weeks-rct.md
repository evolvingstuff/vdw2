### The effect of different doses of vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance during pregnancy.

Gynecol Endocrinol. 2013 Apr;29(4):396-9. [doi: 10.3109/09513590.2012.752456.](https://doi.org/10.3109/09513590.2012.752456.)

Low serum vitamin D levels are correlated with insulin resistance during pregnancy. We have assessed the effects of different doses of vitamin D on insulin resistance during pregnancy. A randomized clinical trial was done on 120 women with a gestational age of less than 12 weeks. The women were divided into three groups randomly. 

* Group A received 200 IU vitamin D daily, 

* group B 50,000 IU vitamin D monthly and 

* group C 50,000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks 

from 12 weeks of pregnancy until delivery. 

The serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured before and after intervention. We used the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance. The mean ± standard deviation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased in 

* group C from 7.3 ± 5.9 to 34.1 ± 11.5 ng/ml and in 

* group B it increased from 7.3 ± 5.3 to 27.23 ± 10.7 ng/ml, 

but the level of vitamin D in group A increased from 8.3 ± 7.8 to 17.7 ± 9.3 ng/ml (p < 0.001). The mean differences of insulin and HOMA-IR before and after intervention in groups A and C were significant (p = 0.01, p = 0.02). This study has shown that supplementation of pregnant women with 50 000 IU vitamin D every 2 weeks improved insulin resistance significantly.
