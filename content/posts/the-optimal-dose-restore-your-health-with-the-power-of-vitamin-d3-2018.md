### Optimal Dose - Judson Somerville MD and patient

[The Optimal Dose: Restore Your Health With the Power of Vitamin D3](https://www.amazon.com/Optimal-Dose-Restore-Health-Vitamin-ebook/dp/B07JJNKW4D/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1548757988&sr=8-3&keywords=optimal+dose)  **** $0 Kindle Unliimited. &nbsp; &nbsp; $5 Kindle,  &nbsp; &nbsp;$14 paperback **<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/optimal-dose-cover.jpg" alt="image" width="150">

* 30,000 IU Vitamin D daily for all of his (adult) patients

   * The typical patient lost 10 lbs per month on 30,000 IU of vitamin D daily, without any hunger, exercise, or forcing themselves to reduce calories – effortless -  Approximately 70% of patients lost a lot of weight (personal communications)

   * His book did not have room to mention the cofactors which he suggests, such as Magnesium Malate and Vitamin K2

* "My dual experience as both a long-time (pain) physician and a long-time patient has given me a unique point of view"

* Fewer overall visits to the doctor by his patients

* "I decided to concentrate on my chronic lack of deep restorative sleep (DRS)"

* "I even argue that lack of DRS (Deep Restorative Sleep) is the most widespread symptom of winter syndrome."

   * VitaminDWiki has 50 studies on [Sleep and Vitamin D](/tags/sleep-and-vitamin-d.html)

* Restless Leg Syndrome greatly reduced with increased Vitamin D = VitaminDWiki has  [15 studies](/tags/15-studies.html)

*** Optimal dosing of vitamin D3 helps to **: eliminate sleep apnea,  eliminate restless leg syndrome,  restore deep restorative sleep,  allow you to wake up rested and full of energy,  prevent or eliminate snoring, resolve allergies,  eliminate influenza,  correct autism spectrum disorder,  slow or eliminate dementia,  slow or eliminate Alzheimer’s disease,  prevent Lyme disease and other viral diseases,  prevent cancer,  extend the life of someone with cancer,  fight off TB,  restore your ideal body weight, which for many involves the loss of massive amounts of weight,  change your appetite so you are easily satiated and not craving food,  block unneeded and excess fat absorption (most),  boost metabolism 20–30%,  boost muscle strength 30–40%,  increase fertility,  boost energy 20–30%,  slow aging,  close wounds,  fight off bacterial infections like MRSA,  prevent diabetes,  prevent multiple sclerosis,  fight off any of the above-listed diseases, and boost the immune system.

#### Review by the founder of VitaminDWiki

* First high-dose book by a doctor - who discovered Vitamin D after becoming a patient

* He has prescribed 30,000 IU of Vitamin D to >2,000 patients

* His well-written book includes success stories with sleep problems, weight problems (both loss and gain), pain, and flu

   * 3 capsules of 5,000 before breakfast and 3 capsules before dinner,

   * At lower cost, some patients used 50,000 before dinner every second day (25,000 IU daily average)

   * His office is on the US border with Texas. Some of the patients could not afford cofactors, of vitamin D tests, so they were not required.

* His short book does not provide adequate room to give many details - such as dosing, cofactors, etc.(see personal communication and summary table** Bottom line: I am going to try doubling my dose from 12,500 IU daily in the winter to 25,000 IU (50,000 every second day) **** Update: March 2021 - have been taking 100,000 IU every 4th day for 2+ years **** There are many reasons to believe that infrequent dosing is [Better than Daily](/posts/better-than-daily) **---

1. A fellow Chirper and a vitamin D3 post that no one wants to listen to!

1. Optimal blood levels, optimal dosing of vitamin D3 and improved athletic performance!
