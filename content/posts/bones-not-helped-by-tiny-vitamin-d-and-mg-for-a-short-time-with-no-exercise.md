#### Combined vitamin D and magnesium supplementation does not influence markers of bone turnover or glycemic control: A randomized controlled clinical trial

Nutr Res . 2023 Feb;110:33-43. [doi: 10.1016/j.nutres.2022.12.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2022.12.005)

High-dose vitamin D supplementation can increase total osteocalcin concentrations that may reduce insulin resistance in individuals at risk for prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Magnesium is a cofactor in vitamin D metabolism and activation. The purpose of this study was to determine the combined effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation on total osteocalcin concentrations, glycemic indices, and other bone turnover markers after a  **12-week**  intervention in individuals who were overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy. We hypothesized that combined supplementation would improve serum total osteocalcin concentrations and glycemic indices more than vitamin D supplementation alone or a placebo. A total of 78 women and men completed this intervention in 3 groups: a vitamin D and magnesium group  **(1000 IU vitamin D3 and 360 mg magnesium**  glycinate), a vitamin D group (1000 IU vitamin D3), and a placebo group. Despite a significant increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in the vitamin D and magnesium group compared with the placebo group (difference = 5.63; CI, -10.0 to -1.21; P = .001) post-intervention, there were no differences in serum concentrations of total osteocalcin, glucose, insulin, and adiponectin or the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among groups (P > .05 for all). Additionally, total osteocalcin (β = -0.310, P = .081), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (β = 0.004, P = .986), and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide (β = 0.426, P = .057), were not significant predictors of HOMA-IR after the intervention. Combined supplementation was not associated with short-term improvements in glycemic indices or bone turnover markers in participants who were overweight and obese in our study. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03134417).
