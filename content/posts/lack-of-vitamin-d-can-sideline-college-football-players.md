* “Nearly 60 percent of college football players have low levels of vitamin D. . . “

* “. . analysis that reviewed data on 214 college football players who'd taken part in the National Football League's so-called "scouting combine" in 2015”

* “. . 59 percent of the players had below-normal vitamin D levels. More than half of those who did -- 56 percent -- had sustained a relevant strain or injury during play.”

* “That figure went up to 73 percent among those with "severely deficient" vitamin D levels.”

* “By comparison, similar strains and injuries affected just 40 percent of players with normal vitamin D levels.”

* “And among the 14 players who had missed at least one game as a result of such targeted strains or injuries, 86 percent had low vitamin D levels.”

* “ . . 70 percent of black players had low vitamin D, compared with 13 percent of white players”
