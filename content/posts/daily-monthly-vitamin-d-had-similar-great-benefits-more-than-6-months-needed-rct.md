 **1750 IU)/day vs. 50,000 IU/month for elderly** 

 **Results of 50,000 IU/month (with 100% compliance)** 

Vitamin D @ 0 months = 21 ng

Vitamin D @ 6 months = 36 ng

Vitamin D @ 18 months =  **<span style="color:#F00;">41 ng </span>** 

 **The average waist  size of the 50,000 IU group   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; went from 105 cm to 98 cm with just 18 pills (1 per month for 18 months)** 

 **Note: Many studies feel that vitamin D plateaus in 2-3 months, this study needed 6+ months**

 **Weekly, biweekly, and sometimes even monthly dosing <span style="color:#00F;">better</span> than daily** 

* Bodies have been evolved to store vitamin D (not require daily sunshine)

* Many studies have found non-daily dosing of Vitamin D to actually produce better results than daily

* Intermittent  (<19 days) appears to provide the most benefit, but monthly dosing is OK (~30ng)
