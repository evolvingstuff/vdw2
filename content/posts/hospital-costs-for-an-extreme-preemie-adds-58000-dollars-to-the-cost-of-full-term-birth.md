Background: The effect of gestational age (GA) on comorbidity prevalence, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and all-cause costs is significant for extremely premature (EP) infants in the United States.

Objectives: To characterize real-world patient characteristics, prevalence of comorbidities, rates of HCRU, and direct healthcare charges and societal costs among premature infants in US Medicaid programs, with respect to GA and the presence of respiratory comorbidities.

Methods: Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, diagnosis and medical claims data from 6 state Medicaid databases (1997-2018) of infants born at less than 37 weeks of GA (wGA) were collected retrospectively. Data from the index date (birth) up to 2 years corrected age or death, stratified by GA (EP, ≤28 wGA; very premature <span>[VP]</span>, >28 to <32 wGA; and moderate to late premature <span>[M-LP]</span>, ≥32 to <37 wGA), were compared using unadjusted and adjusted generalized linear models.

Results: Among 25 573 premature infants (46.1% female; 4462 <span>[17.4%]</span> EP; 2904 <span>[11.4%]</span> VP; 18 207 <span>[71.2%]</span> M-LP), comorbidity prevalence, HCRU, and all-cause costs increased with decreasing GA and were highest for EP. Total healthcare charges, excluding index hospitalization and all-cause societal costs (US dollars), were 2 to 3 times higher for EP than for M-LP (EP $74 436 vs M-LP $27 541 and EP $28 504 vs M-LP $15 892, respectively).

Conclusions: Complications of preterm birth, including prevalence of comorbidities, HCRU, and costs, increased with decreasing GA and were highest among EP infants during the first 2 years in this US analysis.
