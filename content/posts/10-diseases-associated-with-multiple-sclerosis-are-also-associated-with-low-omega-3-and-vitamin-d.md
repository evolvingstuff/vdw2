#### Multiple sclerosis - A lifestyle disease?

Neurology Journal Editorial doi:http:/​/​dx.​doi.​org/​10.​1212/​WNL.​0000000000002487

William B. Grant, PhD and Trond Riise, PhD

Chronic diseases are the primary cause of disability, morbidity, and death in Western developed countries. Many of these diseases are related to environmental influences including diet, smoking, and other lifestyle factors. Public health measures address some of these factors, and studies strengthening the links between environmental factors and health can be useful in this regard.

#### Editorial documented 10 diseases associated with Multiple Sclerosis

* 10 of the diseases are also associated with low Omega-3

* 7 of the diseases are also associated with low Vitamin D or low UVB

#### The only diseases which the editorial did not associate with low vitamin D/UVB were

### Note:

* It appears that all 10 of the MS associated diseases are associated with low Omega-3 and low vitamin D

* Omega-3 is synergistically associated with vitamin D

* It is very important that MS patients increase their levels of Omega-3 and Vitamin D so as to minimize getting the associated diseases

> 5 most prevelant: depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and chronic lung disease.

> The most prevalent autoimmune diseases occurring with MS were thyroid disease and psoriasis.

> Cancer:cervical, breast, and digestive system cancers.

> higher than expected risk of meningiomas and urinary system cancers

> lower than expected risk of pancreatic, ovarian, prostate and testicular cancer, compared to the general population.
