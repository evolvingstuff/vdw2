&lt;p>Background:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a frequent developmental disorder characterized by pervasive deficits in social interaction, impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication, and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. It has been previously reported that there is vitamin D deficiency in autistic children; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation in ASD children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autistic boys have poor bones (most likely due to low vitamin D)</title><link>/posts/autistic-boys-have-poor-bones-most-likely-due-to-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autistic-boys-have-poor-bones-most-likely-due-to-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Autism 2.1 times more likely if obese and PCOS (relationships to vitamin D not mentioned)</title><link>/posts/autism-21-times-more-likely-if-obese-and-pcos-relationships-to-vitamin-d-not-mentioned.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-21-times-more-likely-if-obese-and-pcos-relationships-to-vitamin-d-not-mentioned.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sleep problems reduced by vitamin D - Autistics and controls</title><link>/posts/sleep-problems-reduced-by-vitamin-d-autistics-and-controls.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sleep-problems-reduced-by-vitamin-d-autistics-and-controls.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Autism 4 times more likely if low vitamin D during first trimester</title><link>/posts/autism-4-times-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-during-first-trimester.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-4-times-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-during-first-trimester.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="lower-maternal-serum-25oh-d-in-first-trimester-associated-with-higher-autism-risk-in-chinese-offspring">Lower maternal serum 25(OH) D in first trimester associated with higher autism risk in Chinese offspring&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Objective High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was previously reported in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but little is known about the efficacy of vitamin D3 treatment in ASD, although data from pilot studies seem promising. We hypothesized that serum vitamin D levels are reduced in ASD and correlate with the severity of disease. Also, we hypothesized that vitamin D3 treatment may be beneficial for a considerable portion of children with ASD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Behavior changes due to low vitamin D – in rodents</title><link>/posts/behavior-changes-due-to-low-vitamin-d-in-rodents.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/behavior-changes-due-to-low-vitamin-d-in-rodents.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-impact-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-on-behavior-and-brain-function-in-rodents">The impact of vitamin D deficiency on behavior and brain function in rodents&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>•We review studies using rodent models of vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>•Prenatal vitamin D deficiency alters brain development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>•Adult vitamin D deficiency alters behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as an environmental risk factor for several neurological disorders. To investigate the biological plausibility of this risk factor, vitamin D (DVD) deficiency rodent models have been used to examine the impact of DVD deficiency on neurobiology and behaviour. The majority of these studies have taken a developmental stance and examined the impact of vitamin D deficiency during gestation on the adult behaviour of the &lt;strong>offspring&lt;/strong> .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autism reduced in one child after vitamin D supplementation – 2014</title><link>/posts/autism-reduced-in-one-child-after-vitamin-d-supplementation-2014.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-reduced-in-one-child-after-vitamin-d-supplementation-2014.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-improves-autistic-symptoms-in-a-child-with-autism-spectrum-disorder">Vitamin D Supplementation Improves Autistic Symptoms in a Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. Among the environmental factors, vitamin D3 (cholecaliferol) seems to play a significant role in the etiology of ASD because this vitamin is important for brain development. Lower concentrations of vitamin D3 may lead to increased brain size, altered brain shape, and enlarged ventricles, which have been observed in patients with ASD. Vitamin D3 is converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver. Higher serum concentrations of this steroid may reduce the risk of autism. Importantly, children with ASD are at an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, possibly due to environmental factors. It has also been suggested that vitamin D3 deficiency may cause ASD symptoms. Here, we report on a 32-month-old boy with ASD and vitamin D3 deficiency. His core symptoms of autism improved significantly after vitamin D3 supplementation. This case suggests that vitamin D3 may play an important role in the etiology of ASD, stressing the importance of clinical assessment of vitamin D3 deficiency and the need for vitamin D3 supplementation in case of deficiency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autism and lack of D3 vitamin – review</title><link>/posts/autism-and-lack-of-d3-vitamin-review.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-and-lack-of-d3-vitamin-review.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders 8 (2014) 1685–1698&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A growing body of literature suggests that higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> concentrations, either in utero or in early life, may reduce the risk of autism. For example, an ecological study in the companion paper inversely correlated solar UV-B doses in the United States with prevalence of autism among those aged 6–17 y. That study proposed that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy could account for this finding, although the findings are also consistent with childhood vitamin D deficiency contributing to the condition. Also, in a recent study, children with autism had lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations than did control subjects (19 vs. 33 ng/ml), despite parents of each group reporting the same amount of sun exposure. The same study found highly significant inverse correlations between 25(OH)D and autism rating scales and between 25(OH)D and levels of an antineuronal antibody. This finding indicates that higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations may reduce the symptoms of established autism. Because activated vitamin D, a secosteroid, upregulates DNA-repair genes, vitamin D deficiency during development may inhibit the repair of de novo DNA mutations in fetuses and infants and thus contribute to risk of autism. Vitamin D might also reduce the risk or severity of autism through its anti-inflammatory actions, antiautoimmune effects, increasing seizure threshold, increasing T-regulatory cells, protecting the mitochondria, and upregulating glutathione, which scavenges oxidative by-products and chelates (captures and excretes) heavy metals. Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and childhood is a widespread and growing epidemic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Childhood mental disorders vs levels of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/childhood-mental-disorders-vs-levels-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/childhood-mental-disorders-vs-levels-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="do-children-with-mental-disorders-have-higher-prevalence-of-hypovitaminosis-d">Do children with mental disorders have higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis D?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Inadequate vitamin D level is associated with various adverse medical outcomes. There is a growing concern that insufficient vitamin D may play a role in the development of psychiatric symptoms. This study aims to answer the question: do children with mental disorders have a higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis D? A retrospective chart review examined 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in youth ages 7 to 17 (n=67) at two Oregon psychiatric residential facilities. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as &amp;lt;20 ng/ml and insufficiency as &amp;lt;30 ng/ml. Diagnoses were organized into six categories. 25(OH)D levels were compared across genders and diagnostic groups using a two-sample t-test and ANOVA, respectively. Statistical differences in prevalence across diagnostic categories were calculated using a Pearson chi-square test. Using the data from Saintonge’s NHANES III study on healthy US children for comparison, 21% of our cohorts were found to be vitamin D deficient and 64% insufficient, in contrast to 14% and 48%, respectively. While our results are not statistically significant, mainly because of small sample size, the overall mean 25(OH)D level in our cohort was insufficient (27.59 ± 9.35 ng/ml), compared to a sufficient mean value of 32.1 ng/ml in the general population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and MS, ALS, Autism, Alzheimer’s and other nervous system diseases – review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-ms-als-autism-alzheimers-and-other-nervous-system-diseases-review.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-ms-als-autism-alzheimers-and-other-nervous-system-diseases-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="review-the-role-of-vitamin-d-in-nervous-system-health-and-disease">Review: The role of vitamin D in nervous system health and disease&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Evidence is mounting that vitamin D deficiency is intimately involved in autism. We report on autism prevalence by US state for those aged 6–17 y in 2010 with respect to indices of solar UV-B (UVB) doses. We calculated autism prevalence rates for white, black and Asian Americans by using total prevalence and relative populations of minors for each ethnic group by state. Analyses omit AK and HI (considered extreme cases), WY (no data), along with AZ and ND for black Americans (low numbers) and DC, ME, MT, ND and SD for Asian Americans (low numbers). For white Americans, the regression coefficient for solar UVB doses and autism prevalence ranged from -0.52 in January to -0.57 in October. For black Americans, the regression coefficient for latitude was 0.61, whereas those for solar UVB ranged from -0.55 to -0.61. For Asian Americans, the values for solar UVB ranged from -0.28 to -0.38. The inverse correlation between solar UVB and autism prevalence is similar to that for many types of cancer in the US. The journal literature indicates that adverse effects on fetal brain development during pregnancy due to vitamin D deficiency can explain these findings. However, we cannot rule out a role of vitamin D deficiency in early life. These results add to the evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be an important risk factor for autism and suggest that pregnant women and autistic individuals raise their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above 30 ng/ml.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autistic measure 5X more likely if low vitamin D in second trimester</title><link>/posts/autistic-measure-5x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-in-second-trimester.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autistic-measure-5x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-in-second-trimester.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="maternal-vitamin-d-levels-and-the-autism-phenotype-among-offspring">Maternal Vitamin D Levels and the Autism Phenotype Among Offspring.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from the skeletal health affection, vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a potential environmental factor triggering for some autoimmune disorders. Vitamin D might play a role in the regulation of the production of auto-antibodies. Immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D may act not only through modulation of T-helper cell function, but also through induction of CD4+CD25 high regulatory T-cells. We are the first to investigate the relationship between serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) auto-antibodies in autistic children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No noticeable decrease in Autism in child with high level of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/no-noticeable-decrease-in-autism-in-child-with-high-level-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-noticeable-decrease-in-autism-in-child-with-high-level-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dr-cannell-highlightshttpblogvitamindcouncilorg20120710dear-dr-cannell-no-improvement-with-vitamin-d20">&lt;a href="http://blog.vitamindcouncil.org/2012/07/10/dear-dr-cannell-no-improvement-with-vitamin-d/%20">Dr. Cannell highlights&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
