#### Reduced serum vitamin D levels are associated with poor sleep quality in early stroke patients

Background: Poor sleep quality and vitamin D deficiency are common in stroke patients. Our aim was to evaluate the possible association between vitamin D and sleep quality in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients.

Methods: A total of 301 AIS patients were screened and completed 1-month follow-up. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was used to assess the vitamin D status by a competitive protein-binding assay at baseline. All patients were divided into equal quartile according to the distribution of 25(OH)D. One month after stroke, sleep quality was evaluated by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire; depression status was confirmed by 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD).

Results: There were 89 (29.6%) AIS patients with poor sleep quality 1-month post-event. Within 24 h after admission, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in patients with poor sleep quality after stroke (P < 0.001). In the results of multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of  **poor sleep quality was 6.199**  (95% CI, 2.066-18.600) for the lowest quartile of 25(OH)D compared with the highest quartile. In patients without depression, reduced 25(OH)D were still significantly associated with poor sleep quality (OR = 8.174, 95% CI = 2.432-27.473). Furthermore, 25(OH)D and HAMD score were combined to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of poor sleep quality, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.775.

Conclusion: Reduced serum levels of vitamin D at admission were independently and significantly associated with poor sleep quality at 1 month after stroke. Our findings suggested the combination of vitamin D and depression status could provide important predictive information for post-stroke sleep quality.
