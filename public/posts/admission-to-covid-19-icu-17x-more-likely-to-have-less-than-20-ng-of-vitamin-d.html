Manson, MD, DrPH, of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, who was not involved with the research but has spoken about the topic in a video report for Medscape, said: &ldquo;We know from several studies that a low vitamin D level is associated with a higher risk of having COVID-19 and severe illness, but correlation does not prove causation.&rdquo;</p><p>I think that improving vitamin D status is a promising way to reduce the risk of severe illness, but we need randomized controlled trials to prove cause and effect," she told Medscape Medical News.</p><p><strong>103 Patients With Severe COVID-19, 52 With Mild COVID-19, 206 Controls</strong></p><p>Gennari said several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin D deficiency might be a risk factor for COVID-19 severity.</p><p>Countries with lower average levels of vitamin D or lower UVB radiation exposure have higher COVID-19 mortality, and &ldquo;demographic groups known to be at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (such as black individuals, the elderly, nursing home residents, and those with obesity and diabetes) are at high risk of COVID-19 hospitalization/mortality,&rdquo; he noted.</p><p>There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Italy, where mortality rates from COVID-19 have been particularly high.</p><p>To examine the relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity/mortality, the researchers studied three groups:</p><ul><li><p>103 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 with respiratory insufficiency who were admitted to a Milan hospital from March 9 to April 30.</p></li><li><p>52 patients with mild COVID-19, recruited from patients and staff from a nearby nursing home who had a positive test for COVID-19.</p></li><li><p>206 healthy controls, matched 2:1 with symptomatic patients of the same age, weight, and gender, from 3174 patients who had vitamin D measured during a routine check-up from January to March 2020.</p></li></ul><p>Patients in the</p><ul><li><p>hospitalized group had lower mean vitamin D levels (18.2 ng/mL) than those with</p></li><li><p>mild COVID-19 (30.3 ng/mL) or those in the</p></li><li><p>control group (25.4 ng/mL).</p></li></ul><p>Patients with symptomatic versus mild COVID-19 were slightly older and more likely to have at least one comorbidity and less likely to be taking a vitamin D supplement at baseline (30% vs 79%).</p><p>Among symptomatic patients, mean vitamin D levels were inversely associated with interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein, &ldquo;both of which are a direct expression of the inflammatory status,&rdquo; Gennari noted.</p><p>About half of the hospitalized patients (49) were admitted to a ward and discharged after a mean stay of 16 days (none died).</p><p>The other 54 hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe acute respiratory distress; 38 patients received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 16 patients received endotracheal intubation.</p><p><strong>Of the 54 patients admitted to ICU, 19 patients died from respiratory distress after a mean of 19 days,</strong> &ldquo;consistent with the literature,&rdquo; and the other 35 patients were discharged after a mean of 21 days.</p><p>Patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to ICU, as opposed to a ward, were more likely to be male, have at least one comorbidity, have higher baseline IL-6 levels and neutrophil counts, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts.</p><p>They also had lower mean vitamin D levels (14.4 vs 22.4 ng/mL) and were <strong>more likely to have vitamin D deficiency (vitamin D &lt; 20 ng/mL; 80% vs 45%).</strong></p><p>Patients admitted to ICU who died had lower baseline vitamin D levels than those who survived (13.2 vs 19.3 ng/mL).</p><p>Vitamin D levels were inversely associated with respiratory distress requiring ICU admission <span>[odds ratio, 1.06; P = .038]</span> and with mortality (odds ratio, 1.18, P = 029), independent of IL-6 levels and other comorbidities.</p><p>&ldquo;That vitamin D levels are associated with improved outcomes independent of IL-6 could reflect that IL-6 is an imperfect measure of the inflammatory process or that vitamin D is related to outcomes for other reasons, such as enhancement of innate or adaptive immunity,&rdquo; said Meltzer.</p><p>He added that &ldquo;this is not to exclude the possibility that vitamin D has important immunomodulatory effects.&rdquo;</p><p>Gennari, Meltzer, and Manson have reported no relevant financial relationships.</p><p>ASBMR 2020 annual meeting.
