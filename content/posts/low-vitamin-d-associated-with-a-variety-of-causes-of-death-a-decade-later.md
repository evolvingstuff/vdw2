BACKGROUND: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration has been linked to mortality in several studies, but appropriate cutoffs to define risk categories are under debate.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a repeated-measurements analysis on the association of serum 25(OH)D concentrations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, with particular attention given to the shape of dose-response relations.

DESIGN: Concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured in n = 9578 baseline and n = 5469 5-y follow-up participants of the ESTHER study, which is a German population-based cohort aged 50-74 y at baseline. Deaths were recorded during  **9.5 y of follow-up**  (median). Restricted cubic splines were used to assess dose-response relations and Cox regression with time-dependent variables to estimate hazard ratios.

RESULTS: During follow-up, 1083 study participants died, of whom 350 individuals died of cardiovascular diseases, 433 individuals died of cancer, and 55 individuals died of respiratory diseases. The  **overall mortality**  <span>[HR (95% CI)]</span> of subjects with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D concentrations <30 nmol/L](25(OH)D%20concentrations%20<30%20nmol/L) or vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D concentrations from 30 to 50 nmol/L) was significantly increased [1.71 (1.43, 2.03) and 1.17 (1.02, 1.35), respectively](25(OH)D%20concentrations%20from%2030%20to%2050%20nmol/L)%20was%20significantly%20increased%20[1.71%20(1.43,%202.03)%20and%201.17%20(1.02,%201.35),%20respectively) compared with that of subjects with sufficient 25(OH)D concentrations (>50 nmol/L)]. 

Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with increased 

* cardiovascular mortality <span>[1.39 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.89)]</span>, 

* cancer mortality <span>[1.42 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.88)]</span> and 

* respiratory disease mortality <span>[2.50 (95% CI: 1.12, 5.56)]</span>. 

The association of 25(OH)D concentrations with all-cause mortality proved to be a nonlinear inverse association with risk that started to increase at 25(OH)D concentrations <75 nmol/L.

CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In particular, vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D concentration <30 nmol/L](25(OH)D%20concentration%20<30%20nmol/L) was strongly associated with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases.
