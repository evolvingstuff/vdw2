#### [On Health Care, Who Needs Congress?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/opinion/corporate-america-health-care-congress.html?_r=0) NYT Aug 2017

 **US Health care is provided to** 

147 million via employers

50+ million via Medicare

50+ million via Medicaid

 **If definine health care affordability as < 9.7% of income** 

Health care will NOT be affordable to HALF of the population in a decade

 **[% of families where health care premiums and deductable will exceed 9.7% of income](http://www.htahealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Leading_US_Companies_Announce_Plan_to_Transform_the_Corporate_Health_Care_System.pdf)** ]

Note: These costs do not seem to include 

* employer share of health costs

* cost of time-off from job

* cost of training a new employee (if they are not able to return to work)

[Health Transformation Alliance](http://www.htahealth.com)  is a consortium of 41 employers trying to lower the costs of healthcare

HTA employers have only 6.5 million employees (4% of the 147 million listed above)

No mention of prevention on website or video

They appear to mainly focus on the following options for employers

* Reducing costs of drugs by combined purchase (hope to save $600 million over three years))

* Have employees go to the "better" hospitals

* Use of Dr. Watson (IBM) soon - such as increase Cancer diagnosis (but not Cancer prevention)

 **"We and our employees spend more than $5 billion each year on four procedures and ailments:  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; knee replacements  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; hip replacements  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; back pain  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; diabetes"**

#### Employers could easily give Vitamin D to employee families via Amazon delivery service

Amazon permits employees to buy specific products and charge them to their company

So, employees could have vitamin D for their families delivered by Amazon to their homes

This totally eliminates the distribution cost and problems with delivery via employers or doctors/hospitals
