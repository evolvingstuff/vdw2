986 patients, 3 centers in the UK Clinical Trial

50% had <16 ng of Vitamin D

75% had <20 ng of Vitamin D

 **3 Vitamin D treatments** 

* None = control group  (>20 ng?)

* Maintenance therapy (800-2,000IU daily) -  **<span style="color:#00F;">2X INCREASE in deaths</span>**  

* High-dose booster therapy (up to 300,000IU total, split over multiple doses) <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nts-recommendation-on-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-insufficiency-adults.pdf">PDF</a>  
  **<span style="color:#00F;">2X DECREASE in deaths</span>**  

   * a loading regimen to provide a total of approximately 300,000 units vitamin D, given either as separate weekly or daily doses over 6 to 10 weeks : 

   * The exact regimen will depend on local preference and local availability of vitamin D preparations but could include: 20,000 units capsules, two given weekly for 7 weeks (280,000 units)

#### Suspect why this happened (in the UK)

The UK considers < 12 ng = deficient, and so a loading/restoring dose of 300,000 IU is given

A person with 13 ng to xx ng considered not to be deficient, so is given a maintenance dose 

&nbsp; &nbsp; which keeps them low, and probably vulnerable to COVID-19 infection

 **Note: This Clinical Trial had no randomization, Dosing was based on pre-existing Vitamin D levels**
