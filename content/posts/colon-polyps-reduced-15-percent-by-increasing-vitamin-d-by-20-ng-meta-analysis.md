# Meta-analysis: Serum vitamin D and colorectal adenoma risk.

Prev Med. 2011 Jun 11. 

Yin L, Grandi N, Raum E, Haug U, Arndt V, Brenner H.

OBJECTIVE:

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of human studies on the association between serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and incident, sporadic colorectal adenoma (CRA) and CRA recurrence.

METHODS:

Relevant studies among humans were identified by systematically searching Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases and by cross-referencing. Due to the heterogeneity across studies in categorizing serum vitamin D levels, all results were recalculated for an increase of serum 25(OH)D by 20ng/ml. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using meta-analysis methods.

RESULTS:

Overall, 10 original studies were included. Specific results for incident CRA according to serum 25(OH)D were reported in 8 studies, and for CRA recurrence in 2 studies, respectively. 

In meta-analyses, summary ORs (95% confidence intervals) regarding incident and recurrent CRA, and both outcomes combined were 0.82 (0.69-0.97), 0.87 (0.56-1.35), and 0.84 (0.72-0.97), respectively, for an increase of 25(OH)D by  **20ng** . No publication bias was found.

CONCLUSION:

Our results support suggestions that serum 25(OH)D levels are inversely associated with CRA risk.

## Definition: colorectal adenoma

An adenoma is a benign tumor that develops from epithelial tissue. Adenomas in the colon are often referred to as adenomatous polyps. Although adenomas aren't cancerous, they have the potential to become cancerous.

Adenomas and Colon Cancer

Most colorectal cancer develops from adenomatous polyps. Adenomas that turn into cancer are referred to as adenocarcinomas.

Colon cancer screening helps identify and remove adenomas before they become a problem.

## Definition adenoma

A benign epithelial tumor having a glandular origin and structure.
