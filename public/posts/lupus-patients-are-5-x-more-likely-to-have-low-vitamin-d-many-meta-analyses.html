China.</p><p>3 Department of Nephrology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, 678 Furong Road, Hefei, Anhui. China.</p><p>Background and Objective：The evidence regarding the association between serum/plasma vitamin D (VitD) concentrations and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is inconsistent. The study was based on relevant results from literatures that were identified and evaluated. The aim of this meta-analysis is to determine circulating VitD in SLE patients and explore influencing factors.</p><p>Methods：Studies examining VitD levels in SLE patients were identified through targeted searches in the PubMed and EMBASE databases (up to December 2017). Data extracted from eligible studies was synthesized to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (CI). A fixed or a random effects model was applied to calculate the pooled SMDs and ORs depending on heterogeneity across studies.</p><p>Results：A total of 24 studies, including 6017 patients and 18,417 controls were included. The pooled analysis suggested that VitD levels were significantly lower in SLE patients compared with those in controls <span>[SMD= -0.09, 95%CI= -0.12 to -0.06, P &lt; 0.001]</span>. When the studies were stratified by ethnicity, VitD concentrations were also significantly lower in Asian, Caucasian and African patients. When the studies were stratified by age, gender, VitD level was lower in patients than that in controls. Subgroup analyses stratified by measurement type (expect for radioimmunoassay) also demonstrated consistent results.</p><p>Moreover, VitD insufficiency was more prevalent in SLE patients than healthy controls <span>[<strong>OR=6.57</strong>, 95%CI=4.64-9.29]</span>.</p><p>Conclusion: Compared with healthy controls, SLE patients had lower concentration of VitD. Additionally, the prevalence of VitD insufficiency is more common in SLE patients.</p><hr><h4 id=lupus-44-x-nore-if-low-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-aug-2019>Lupus 4.4 X nore if low vitamin D - meta-analysis Aug 2019</h4><p><strong>Association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and systemic lupus erythematosus: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</strong></p><p>Int J Rheum Dis. 2019 Aug 30. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185X.13676.>doi: 10.1111/1756-185X.13676.</a></p><p>Guan SY1,2, Cai HY3, Wang P1,2, Lv TT4, Liu LN1,2, Mao YM1,2, Zhao CN1,2, Wu Q1,2, Dan YL1,2, Sam NB1,2, Wang DG3, Pan HF1,2.</p><p>AIM:</p><p>The indicators for measuring vitamin D are various, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is considered as the optimal indicator of total vitamin D levels. In this study, we aim to deeply explore the 25(OH)D status in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and evaluate its relation to SLE risk and disease severity.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>Literature about 25(OH)D status and its associations with SLE were searched in Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Standardized mean difference (SMD), odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were illustrated by forest plots, and correlation coefficients (r) were combined by generic inverse variance method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were quantified by I-squared (I2 ) test, funnel plot and Egger&rsquo;s test, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were further examined by leave-one-out method.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Nineteen articles were included into our meta-analysis. The overall results showed that compared with the healthy controls, the circulating 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in SLE patients (pooled SMD = -1.63, 95% CI: -2.51 to -0.76). Subgroup analysis revealed that compared with the healthy controls, SLE patients of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) ≥ 10, Arab and European ethnicity, all 4 seasons, no vitamin D supplement, had significantly lower circulating 25(OH)D levels; no significant differences were observed in SLE patients of SLEDAI &lt; 10, mixed ethnicity, spring, summer, vitamin D supplement, respectively; no matter the changes of age, disease duration, and the therapy of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive or neither, circulating 25(OH)D levels were significantly reduced in SLE patients. The deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency of vitamin D could significantly elevate, slightly decrease (not significantly), significantly decrease SLE risk, respectively (pooled OR = 4.37, 95% CI: 1.49 to 12.84; pooled OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.26; pooled OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.63). Circulating 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with SLEDAI (pooled correlation coefficient = -0.50, 95% CI: -0.8278 to -0.1689).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Compared with healthy controls, 25(OH)D levels are significantly lower in SLE patients, which is influenced by disease activity, ethnicity, seasons and vitamin D supplement; no matter the change of age, diseases duration and therapy of corticosteroid or immunosuppressive or neither, 25(OH)D levels are significantly decreased in SLE patients; the deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency of vitamin D could significantly elevate, slightly decrease, and significantly decrease SLE risk, respectively; and 25(OH)D levels inversely correlate with SLEDAI.</p><hr><h4 id=lupus-meta-analysis---sept-2019>Lupus meta-analysis - Sept 2019</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D status in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): A systematic review and meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Autoimmunity Reviews, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2019.102392>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2019.102392</a></p><p>Md.
