 **Translation by Google to English** 

today I again called Professor 

cícero coimbra because're again that 

he was with us and brought a given 

so interesting that we ask for 

it back and tell all to you 

the teacher reminds thank you for 

your generous availability tac 

us our listeners more health 

of the whole Brazil and beyond Brazil 

taking advantage of already sending hi to 

our our Portuguese brothers we 

watch also not only what's 

going on that today we are with 

so much infertility 

but after this woman can 

get pregnant as she could be 

helping that baby since the middle 

bb environment is she optimize 

improve throughout not only the cognitive part 

but emotionally also that child 

first gratitude is all  my 

guarantees to make sure I am very grateful for the 

opportunity you offer to bring 

this information public it should 

feel that way too so it are 

many factors not are many factors 

but I think there are factors is that 

are critical we could mention one by one 

from among these criticisms in a way 

summed up to a critical point i am 

are the two major shortcomings of the 

world's population and mostly or 

accidental vitamin D deficiency is a something 

very important people today are not 

exposed to the sun 

they live and work in environments 

confined not supplementation with vitamin d 

the fact that vitamin d have that name 

wrong vitamin is because it is much 

more than a hormone 

people find you will find 

vitamin d in food that has 

a balanced diet but did not 

finish the amount which has the 

food should end and whimsy 

the result is because of the 

change of the population habits 

is not because the vitamin D produced in the 

leg when you expose one 

individual habits postponing changes 

fast the population that have occurred in 

recent decades but generation 

malls in people abandoned parks start using 

sunscreen listening to a adding to 

plenty of fun in between four 

walls in confined environments such as the 

internet and videogame is and similar to 

today we have nine out of ten 

people on disability with planet 

vitamin D that is made worse by its own factors 

of diet that people gradually 

acquired able to diet wrong that 

people gradually acquired 

along these same decades in 

reducing the consumption of greens leaves 

raw green that has a reason  **folate**  

that vitamin b9 natural as important 

to maintain the altered genes that all 

we have silent and bb own in 

that when forming in the womb 

mother he received the genes both 

changed both the father and the mother and 

he needs natural vitamin b9 to 

increase  **folate**  to keep silent 

these altered genes in such a way that 

it does not develop a training with 

birth defects and has the 

development of optimized brain 

so it's important that we 

talk numbers I think it's something 

objective is not mine and I have 

insisted and will avail new this 

opportunity you me always offers 

all the other should take 10,000 

units of vitamin d per day 

this is far from a dose 

toxic is recognized by all 

researchers of this vitamin area d 

as a a free dose effects 

toxic since that the person has at least 50 

kilos there is no problem in 

taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per 

day and we could not because of the 

habits of modern urban modern life to 

get this through sun exposure is 

virtually impossible right because the 

only natural source of vitamin D in the 

skin exposure to the sun 

the aam then 10 000 units per day is 

half the maximum you produce for 

a few minutes of sun exposure 

so it is very important that we 

say that imagine a person who has 

fair skin who is young has fur young 

is lying in the pool under the sun 

strong right with almost all your body 

exposed to the sun is able to produce 20 

to 25 thousand units of vitamin d then 

no one will ever be intoxicated with vitamin 

d by sun exposure 

are 10,000 units of vitamin d is 

half the maximum you produce in ten 

minutes of sun exposure 

this way without using sunscreen 

then and we have observed that mothers 

who take 10,000 units of vitamin d 

during pregnancy them on rules 

give birth to babies who shows the 

psychomotor development out of the ordinary 

are actually children 

I am very hesitant to use this expression 

but in this case I have no doubt they 

are gifted children we agree 

We have beautiful experiences in the office 

just as well because as a dose 

that nutritionist can not pass 

so thank God I have doctors who 

can sustain that this dosage and 

have seen people things very 

interesting that we then 

is exchanging experiences 

is fabulous a child gestated in the middle 

atmosphere where the mother is 10,000 units 

International daily of vitamin d 

is another child you even one day 

can suddenly do not you can not really 

do all that we want but it was 

very interesting you can see the 

difference but still the teacher has 

a lot to talk 

it is important you dream is not true 

then you might think if you're you 

need  **magnesium**  to activate 

vitamin D for you do not 

ingest or produce the skin 

vitamin D on the inactive form 

then the population in the western population 

we have 80% of disabled population 

 **magnesium**  because the foods that are 

consumed are foods that is that 

foods are rich in  **magnesium**  are not 

consumed came imagines hissing 

if you want to have a baby with 

brain development to optimized that 

will actually take will show whether 

a child It has a potential 

emotional cognitive instability 

emotional unusual that surprises 

the parents 

you have to give mainly 

vitamin D  **magnesium**  proper doses 

you have to give up these habits 

such as in managing soft 

glue that dramatically damaged the 

absorption of  **magnesium**  you have to have 

vegetables in their food vegetables 

raw in bringing methyl  **folate**  and 

vegetables in general already bring a sliver 

crowns or no longer bring  **magnesium**  

but you can implement magnesia you 

can implement  **magnesium**  you can 

further  **folate**  vitamin b9 

natural you can take the 10 000 

vitamin d units 

you should not should not take acid 

folic during pregnancy not to 

harm including the development 

of the child brain and overall health 

ah and prevent this child has to 

express genes that cause the sam that 

cause diseases that cause 

congenital malformations 

so if we could dream so 

with a with that all pregnant women and 

follow that this view 

is exactly you imagine what would 

happen 20 years from now with this 

country will be wonderful but you are 

here to attend teacher who 

left thank god we will be here 

we will see a wonderful generation 

coming up you are having A paper 

fantastic in promoting that this 

birth of these perez and people that just 

can because this vehicle 

communication network new song 

've talked to you if I can bring 

people like Professor cícero with an 

international genius is because here we 

can talk about all that our 

commitment is to the truth and the truth 

will set you free teacher what else I 

say today that we will change now the 

next generation 

good think it's important we talk 

about this big problem on 

autism explosion will not have to and 

all these guidelines we 

mentioned in the administration sacked 

 **folate**  and not folic acid 

administration of 10,000 units during 

pregnancy effectively prevents the 

emergence of born the birth of 

autistic children 

today there are very clear data 

demonstrating that autism optimism is 

an autoimmune disease Community industry it can be 

even treated with vitamin d in 

when we settled 

I think one thing a true crime 

is not we let so many people with 

vitamin deficiency to vaccinate 

these children because I am not against 

the  **vaccine**  only for the  **vaccine**  but vaccinate 

a population that disability and 

efficient and vitamin d that is so 

important vitamin D based mental 

for you and your immune system 

work in your favor and not against you 

in so you have a low level of 

vitamin D allows you to trigger the 

immune system for example through 

another time  **vaccination**  until a 

opposition denies one 

there such a virus situation and 

bacteria in an infection I wanted to 

tell you trigger the system 

immune deregulated by a lack of 

vitamin immune system to 

can attack your own body and 

often you notice that sometimes 

days after a  **vaccination**  the child changes 

his behavior and months later is 

characterized as having an 

autistic behavior is against non 

 **vaccine**  is to vaccinate without the protection of 

vitamin D speaking children it takes we will 

leave this mother 

a given what the vitamin D dose 

for children for example is calculated 

per kilogram of weight right we a 

generally have suggested that children 

at birth right is not being breastfed by mothers 

taking adequate doses of vitamin d 

that are miguel 10min that chicken 

during the entire period of breastfeeding 

which has to be kept exactly but 

if the child child must receive 

it is not the case and even if it would 

that is being nursed by the mother who 

takes 10,000 units no problem 

no she said birth already receive 

thousand units are independent of the weight 

that it has a tinge thousand by 15 

thousand international units per day and 

from then when it reaches 10 kilos 

of weight it starts to take two thousand 

units 15 000 3000 units ie 

five kilos more adds 

another thousand units 

we go for a quick break and 

we came back because today Dr. 

coimbra will give us the recipe to 

have a generation here 20 years 

wonderful program and wait for more 

health today marking history for all 

this new generation what we can 

do to improve health 

behavior cognition finally change this 

generation that I am well even said that 

they are having another problem in 

school learning right 

now is but the endocrinology society that 

Brazil launched a documentation and 

reported that 20 kg per 

deciliter of vitamin blood d is already 

considered good 

this is half the minimum which is a dock on 

its website that the technology company 

north American recommended as the minimum 

then again pregnant woman what 

she needs to do 10,000 units 

vitamin d have to take a day 

 **magnesium**   **magnesium**  supplementation 

least 800 milligrams 

have to take care of this issue 

800 milligrams to for example 500 

milligrams of  **magnesium**  chloride has only 

60 milligrams of  **magnesium**  

is then so must be 

if a  **magnesium**  already capsule has to 

look have to note this is not only 

a  **magnesium**  chloride recipe 

on the radio for us is how chloride 

 **magnesium**  have and have sachets of 33 grams 

available in any ordinary drugstore 

dirt - cheap $ 10 for seven days of 

treatment you put a known content a 

sachet one liter of water and 50ml you take 

four times a day is a day to be an 

American cup or so but will 

decide it at the time - it's a little bit 

I want it but it's her he 

must take before an hour before the 

power not to cause diarrhea 

is due to reduce the dose 

we have recommended that one 

take the highest dose of  **magnesium**  

can do that it will 

include every day always with the 

gut every day without having diarrhea 

that is not there you that this is what has 

been recommended to the literature 

because the use of laboratory tests 

 **magnesium**  do not reflect their need 

anne so no use looking exams 

lab on the issue of vitamin D if you 

take 10 to 10 thousand units per day 

people of lower weight as we have 50 

fifty-odd kilos may even 

spend a little of what the laboratory 

considers as normal so in grams per ml 

but see search the fishermen have 160 

9 grams per ml called up here is a 

natural question is not is not 

really toxic dose just 

above 100 not grams per ml 

but if we really say that 20 on the 

long but a little more than twenty- 

nine grams per ml is the correct dose is 

a full right concentration better 

off than if they touch by tax 30 is 

for people in risk groups is the love 

of God people with the risk group is 

totally another story right 

teacher come is that part 

emotional as we may be 

showing to the people 

especially for these next mothers are 

carriers of these super bbc the future 

what they need to take care of is the 

emotional is critical not have 

experiments that are even made with 

mice in which you submit both rats 

males and females to stress using the 

noise that the biggest most stressor 

mice for rats and after 

subjecting them to a period where a high 

noise level  you put these animals to 

mate and you see that the offspring is born 

with several various malformations 

congenital conclusion is the father of stress 

is the mother's stress that you 

alter the genetics of shirts of 

performances brothers and egg and bringing 

those that child then not having to 

silence their altered genes because 

stress takes but from what we 

could say it's just so the 

public could understand right we have the 

ability if we have methyl  **folate**  

natural vitamin b9 and is not the acid 

folic not acid folic our body 

has the ability to place as 

were tape strips in the mouth of 

nice they are changed so that they 

do not express causing things like 

congenital malformations to the same 

thing happens during pregnancy if 

you have a couple who are in discussions 

frequently keeping with the mother 

maintaining a high level of stress you 

unfairly prejudice the system and 

genetic silencing of genes 

altered the bbi and bb so much need 

of gene silencing right and you 

would change the development of the baby 

brain development you predict 

we saw early in pregnancy you will 

cause congenital malformations by 

pure emotional stress so the mother 

needs peace she needs a balanced emotional 

throughout pregnancy to give 

the allus is a healthy child 

emotionally balanced with great 

optimized brain development is not 

beyond all factors with vitamin d 

 **magnesium**  issue  **folate**  we 

need an emotional well 

balanced during pregnancy and today 

as everybody's stressed 

think today is the enemy is a number 

all because they do not have a disease 

autoimmune I take the office 

that I will make an assessment it does not 

It has so aroused after stress 

yes that was published in more than six 

thousand scientific life events articles 

and stressful precede the appearance the 

autoimmune disease outbreaks including 

multiple sclerosis is then that in 

fact is one thing an already critical factor 

it affects their genetic it affects 

behavior of your immune system 

it favors the emergence of diseases 

italy autoimmune is this going 

black with a pregnant woman who is going 

through all this stress thousand situations 

but whether it is making use of issue 

 **folate**  melt finally mine  **magnesium**  

it can help this baby to start 

some young people by stress 

the undoubtedly heavy inclusive is 

important to remember that it is  **magnesium**  is a 

factor of let's say a 

very important emotional stabilization 

is that  **magnesium**  reticence and produces 

depression and hyper real activity 

emotional about the problems that 

you face cognitive impairment that 

leads you have difficult to take 

forward decisions to stressful situations 

so I can even say it by 

experience itself doses such that 

we recommended  **magnesium**  800 

milligrams of  **magnesium**  daily food 

fractionated into four doses giving to 

you one tranquility in coping 

their big problems I'm 

wrong when I say so nutrient of 

intelligence our emotions without 

doubt if completely why 

I love this footprint program teacher 

process here to steal Professor 

Coimbra several times more health by 

radio that we are close to where 

he's he promised he will get 

time for us please and last 

considerations there his 

deeply the opportunity is here
