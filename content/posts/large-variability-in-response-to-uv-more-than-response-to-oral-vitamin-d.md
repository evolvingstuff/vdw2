#### Notes from the PDF

They used a broad spectrum light. 290-350 nm (both UVB and UVA)

&nbsp; &nbsp;The UVA could decrease vitamin D differently between individuals 

 **Important variables** 

Age, (22-62)

Weight (60-100 kg)

Height (160-190 cm) â€“ taller = more skin area ==> more VitD

Body mass index (21-30 kg/m2)

Gene: rs1544410 (AA/GG/AG)

Skin color (participants had a narrow range of skin color)

 **Variable which were not as important** 

Gender 

Fatty fish intake (0-5 meals/week)

 **Equation**

 **Note: This small study did NOT consider differences due to:** 

* poor liver

* low cholesterol diet

* toxins

* smoking

* Iron level

 **Differences can be very important for such a small study**
