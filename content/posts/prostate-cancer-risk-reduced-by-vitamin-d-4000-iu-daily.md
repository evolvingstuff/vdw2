#### Unlocking the potential-vitamin D in prostate cancer prevention

World J Clin Oncol. 2024 Feb 24; 15(2): 169â€“174  2024 . [doi: 10.5306/wjco.v15.i2.169](https://doi.org/10.5306/wjco.v15.i2.169)

Prostate cancer poses a significant health challenge globally, demanding proactive prevention strategies. This editorial explores the emerging role of vitamin D in prostate cancer prevention. While traditionally associated with bone health, vitamin D is increasingly recognized for its broader impact on immune function, cellular signaling, and cancer prevention. Epidemiological studies suggest an intriguing link between vitamin D deficiency and elevated prostate cancer risk, particularly in regions with limited sunlight exposure. Mechanistically, vitamin D regulates cellular processes, inhibiting unchecked cancer cell growth and bolstering immune surveillance. Personalized prevention strategies, considering individual factors, are deemed essential for harnessing the full potential of vitamin D. To unlock this potential, the future calls for robust research, public awareness campaigns, dietary improvements, and vigilant medical guidance. Collaborative efforts are poised to pave the way toward a future where vitamin D stands as a sentinel in prostate cancer prevention, ushering in hope and improved health for men worldwide.
