Does not indicate how often the 50,000 IU was to be taken

If once every two weeks, the daily average would have been 3,700 IU

Many governments, like Canada, do not permit > 4,000 IU of vitamin D in a single day

Yet thousands of doctors regularly prescribe 50,000 IU weekly as a loading dose 

Perhaps the problem was that the prescription was made by a nurse, not a doctor

Perhaps the problems was that Canadian doctors, like many others around the world, feared loss of income if people were taking vitamin D
