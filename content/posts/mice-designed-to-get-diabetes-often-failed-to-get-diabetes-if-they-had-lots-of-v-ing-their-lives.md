High doses of the active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) prevent diabetes in the  **non-obese diabetic (NOD)**  mouse but also elicit unwanted calcemic side-effects. Because immune cells themselves can convert vitamin D3 into 1,25(OH)2D3 locally, we hypothesized that dietary vitamin D3 can also prevent disease. Thus, we evaluated whether dietary administration of high doses of regular vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) during different periods of life (pregnancy and lactation, early-life (3-14 weeks of age), or lifelong (3-35 weeks of age)) safely prevents diabetes in NOD mice. 

We found that only lifelong treatment raised serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 from 173 nmol/L in controls to 290 nmol/L, without inducing signs of calcemic or bone toxicity, and  **significantly reduced diabetes development**  in both male and female NOD mice. This diabetes protection by vitamin D3 correlated with preserved pancreatic insulin content and improved insulitis scores. Moreover, vitamin D3 treatment decreased interferon-γ-positive CD8+ T-cells and increased CD4+(CD25+)FoxP3+ T-cells in pancreatic draining lymph nodes. 

In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that high doses of regular dietary vitamin D3 can safely prevent diabetes in NOD mice when administered lifelong, although caution is warranted with regards to administering equivalently high doses in humans.

### [NOD Mice Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOD_mice%20)

The incidence of spontaneous diabetes in the NOD mouse is 60-80% in females and 20-30% in males.

### 800 IU is a lot of vitamin D for a mouse

Mice appear to weigh about  1 ounce = 1/16 of a pound.

A 100 lb mouse would need 16 X 100 X 800 IU = 1,280,000 IU – which is far far to much for humans.

### Let’s think about increasing the vitamin D levels during a human lifetime by a similar ratio.

Mouse 173 nmol ==> 290 nmol = 60 % increase

Perhaps consider a human with 30 ng Vitamin D level getting  a 60% increase ( 48 ng)
