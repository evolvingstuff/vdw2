Received 6 July 2012; accepted 25 November 2012. published online 15 February 2013.

Objective: Recent accumulating evidence shows that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in individuals with AD and PD. 

The purpose of the present study is to perform a meta-analysis on the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status in this population of patients.

Methods: We searched all articles in English published up to March 2012 concerning the 25(OH)D level in AD and PD patients. 

* For AD, six studies covering 319 patients and 573 controls were included in the meta-analysis.  

* For PD, five studies discussing 434 patients and 3451 controls were included.

Results: It was found that AD patients had lower levels of 25(OH)D than healthy controls (summary standardized mean difference <span>[SMD]</span>, -1.39; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, -2.79 to 0.01). 

Similar results were found for PD patients versus healthy controls (summary SMD, -1.33; 95% CI, -2.44 to -0.21).

Conclusion: The results indicate that despite the similar mean age between patients and healthy controls in each identified study, both AD and PD patients have lower levels of 25(OH)D than controls.
