 **Highlights** 

* Developed a bio-inspired AgNV-based aptasensor for detection of 25OHD3.

* The LOD of the AgNV-based aptasensor was 0.001 ng/mL with human serum solution.

* The AgNV-based aptasensor could selectively detect 25OHD3 from other vitamins.

* This method can shed light on the development of SERS-based vitamin sensors.

Abstract

Vitamin D has been identified as an essential biomarker for various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, many reports have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D and systemic infections, including coronavirus disease 2019. The villi of the small intestine increase the surface area of the intestinal walls, demonstrating exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen and adding digestive secretions. In this study, based on the villi structure, we developed a bio-inspired silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced  **Raman scattering**  aptasensor for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. The densely packed nanovilli structure enhanced the Raman signal, forming hotspots owing to its large surface area. Using experiments and electromagnetic simulations, we optimized the nanovilli structure as a SERS sensor. The sandwich-type aptasensor was designed using an aptamer and 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione-methylene blue complex. The nanovilli-based aptasensor could sensitively detect various concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, ranging from those found in deficient to excess conditions. 

The detection limit of the nanovilli-based sandwich-type aptasensor for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was  **0.001 ng/mL** , which is much lower than the deficiency concentration, and was detectable even in the human serum. 

In addition, our proposed sensor exhibited good  **repeatability (17.76%) and reproducibility (7.47%)** . Moreover, the nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor could selectively distinguish 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 from other vitamins. The silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor opens a new avenue for the development of a bio-inspired vitamin-sensing platform.
