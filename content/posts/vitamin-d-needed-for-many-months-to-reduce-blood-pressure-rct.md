Announced at American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in Dallas.

The DAYLIGHT Study (Vitamin D therapy in individuals at high risk of hypertension), was stopped after 6 months with 4,000 IU of vitamin D when there was no reduction in blood pressure.

---

 **For many people who are very vitamin D deficient a constant dose of 4,000 IU takes many months to restore vitamin D levels.** 

 **Suspect that the trail was stopped just  when vitamin D levels could start reducing blood pressure.**
