BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D may be important for the development and function of the nervous system. Low serum vitamin D levels have been detected in several neurological diseases.

OBJECTIVE:

To ascertain the relationship between 25(OH)D serum level and disability in subjects with severe acquired brain injury (sABI).

DESIGN:

Prospective cross-sectional study Methods: Consecutive subjects with sABI admitted to neuro-rehabilitation were enrolled. A sample of subjects from the neurological ward was considered the control group. Vitamin D serum levels and blood parameters were measured at admission. Disability Rating Scale (DRS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) were used in assessing disability.

RESULTS:

A total of 104 subjects (34 F, 70 M; mean age 53.9 ± 15.2 years) were enrolled: 54 (19 F, 35 M) with sABI and 50 (15 F, 35 M) subjects as control group. Deficient mean serum levels of vitamin D (19.2 ± 9.4 ng/mL) were detected in the subjects with sABI and a significant inverse correlation between vitamin D serum levels and DRS score was detected (p = 0.04).

CONCLUSION:

Subjects with sABI showed vitamin D deficiency that might correlate to disability severity. The reason is unclear and might represent a secondary phenomenon resulting from the inflammatory process.
