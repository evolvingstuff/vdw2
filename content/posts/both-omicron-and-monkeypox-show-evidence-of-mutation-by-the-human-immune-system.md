### The human immune system can mutate viruses in a particular way- leaving a signature in the RNA or DNA

 **Suspect that most of the time the human-caused mutation results in the killing of the virus  
Unfortunately, very rarely, it will improve the virus: making it more infectious  
In the case of Monkeypox, it seems that the human-induced mutation callows it to spread between humans**

#### Scientists Zero In on Origins of the Monkeypox Outbreak - [New York Times - June 23, 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/health/monkeypox-origin-mutations.html)

* (for Monkeypox) "Of the 47 mutations identified in one analysis, 42 carry the distinct signature of an enzyme called Apobec3. This enzyme, first discovered by researchers studying H.I.V., is a so-called  **host defense factor — an immune-system weapon that animals and people use to disarm viruses**  like monkeypox."

* "Some experts have [cautioned](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2850277/#affiliation-1) [for years](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010141) that the eradication of smallpox in 1980 [left the world vulnerable](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1005769107) to the broader family of poxviruses and raised the odds of monkeypox evolving into [a successful human pathogen](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02104)."
