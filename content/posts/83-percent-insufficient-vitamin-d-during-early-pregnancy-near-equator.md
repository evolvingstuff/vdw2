# Maternal vitamin D status, its associated factors and the course of pregnancy in Thai women.

Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2012 Jun 16. [doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2265.2012.04470.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2012.04470.x.)

CONTEXT:

There are limited data on the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in pregnant women living in Southeast Asia, and changes in their vitamin D status during pregnancy.

OBJECTIVES:

To determine the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy, its predictive factors and the changes in vitamin D status during the course of pregnancy.

DESIGN AND PATIENTS:

A prospective study of 120 pregnant Thai women with gestational age<14 weeks.

MEASUREMENTS:

Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and clinical data were obtained at the first visit, in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Vitamin D inadequacy was defined as 25OHD<75 nmol/L.

RESULTS:

The prevalences of vitamin D inadequacy were  **83.3%** , 30.9% and 27.4% for the first, second and third trimesters. 

The independent predictors of vitamin D inadequacy in the third trimester were 

* not drinking vitamin fortified milk (OR 11.42; 95%CI:3.12-41.86), 

* not taking prenatal vitamins (OR 9.70; 95%CI:2.28-41.19) and 

* having vitamin D deficiency in the first trimester (OR 10.58; 95%CI:2.89-38.80). 

Vitamin D deficiency was not found in women taking prenatal vitamins. 

However, 20 women who took at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D from prenatal vitamins still had vitamin D insufficiency in the third trimester.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D inadequacy is common in pregnant Thai women, especially in the first trimester. 

Vitamin D supplementation may be needed prior to conception and during pregnancy. 

For areas with abundant sun exposure like Thailand, vitamin D supplementation at 400 IU/d is likely to prevent vitamin D deficiency, but is inadequate to prevent vitamin D insufficiency even at 800 IU/d.

# Highlights: with inadequate < 30 ng

* 83% inadequate in 1st trimester

* 10X more likely to be inadequate in 3rd trimester (if not take fortified milk or not take prenatal vitamins)

* 17% insufficiency in 3rd trimester even had 400 IU of prenatal vitamins
