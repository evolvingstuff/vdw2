Objective—Vitamin D deficiency is common and associated with dyslipidemia. However, it is unclear whether oral vitamin D supplementation improves the lipid profile. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine the short-term effects of vitamin D repletion on the lipid profile.

Methods and Results—One hundred fifty-one vitamin D?deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL) adults with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease were randomized to receive either 50 000 IU of vitamin D3 weekly for 8 weeks or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle number. Secondary outcomes included changes in other nuclear magnetic resonance?based and chemical lipid fractions. Vitamin D failed to improve the lipid profile. 

Compared with the placebo, vitamin D repletion did not change small LDL particle number (mean change, +18 nmol/L; 95% CI [?80 to +116 nmol/L](?80%20to%20+116%20nmol/L); P=0.63). There were also no changes in the chemical lipid profile: total cholesterol (+5.8 mg/dL, 95% CI [?1.4 to +13.0 mg/dL](?1.4%20to%20+13.0%20mg/dL), P=0.14); LDL cholesterol (+3.8 mg/dL, 95% CI [?2.5 to +10.2 mg/dL](?2.5%20to%20+10.2%20mg/dL), P=0.13); high–density lipoprotein cholesterol (+0.4 mg/dL 95% CI [?1.6 to +2.6 mg/dL](?1.6%20to%20+2.6%20mg/dL), P=0.71); and triglycerides (+7.9 mg/dL 95% CI [?6.5 to +22.3 mg/dL](?6.5%20to%20+22.3%20mg/dL)). In the vitamin D repletion group, exploratory multivariate regression analysis demonstrates that changes in LDL cholesterol were positively correlated with the changes in serum calcium (P<0.001) and inversely with the changes in serum parathyroid hormone (P=0.02).

Conclusion—In contrast to the association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and dyslipidemia, correcting vitamin D deficiency in the short-term does not improve the lipid profile. Repletion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels raised serum calcium levels and decreased serum parathyroid hormone levels. These expected physiological responses to vitamin D therapy were correlated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol.

## Comments by VitaminDWiki

8 weeks is just about enough time to replete the vitamin D levels for healthy, normal weight persons. 

If the RCT had lasted 12-16 weeks then the cholesterol levels probably would have gone down.

It is strange that the abstract did not mention the vitamin D levels before and after the RCT.

What did they consider to be repletion:  20 ng, 30 ng, or what?

The clinical trial indicates that only people with < 20 ng of vitamin D were accepted.

The clinical trial also indicates that the people should have BMI > 35 kg/m2 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- which is enough weight that it takes more than 8 weeks time to replete vitamin D without loading doses.

50,000 IU of vitamin D (7,000 IU daily) should not be used as a monotherapy - [cofactors](/tags/cofactors.html) should be adjusted if > 4,000 IU
