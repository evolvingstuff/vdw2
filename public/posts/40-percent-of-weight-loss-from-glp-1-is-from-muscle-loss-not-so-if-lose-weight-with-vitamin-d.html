#### Weight-loss drug found to shrink heart muscle in mice, human cells - Nov 2024

*  **First documented in a 2021 clinical trial** 

*  **The rate of weight loss significantly impacts muscle loss - faster weight loss typically results in greater muscle mass reduction.

#### What percentage of weight loss from diets is due to muscle loss? Asked Perplexity AI Nov 2024

The percentage of muscle loss during weight loss varies based on several key factors:

 **Normal Weight vs Overweight Individuals** 

 **In overweight individuals, 20-30% of total weight loss comes from muscle mass.**  For normal weight individuals, the percentage is higher, with 35% or more of total weight loss coming from muscle tissue &amp;nbsp;[3](https://lifesum.com/nutrition-explained/the-effect-of-protein-intake-on-muscle-maintenance-during-weight-loss)

 **Impact of Diet Type** 

The speed and severity of caloric restriction significantly affects muscle loss:

* Very low-calorie diet (500 calories/day): 18% of initial weight loss is muscle mass

* Standard low-calorie diet (1,250 calories/day): 7.7% of initial weight loss is muscle mass &amp;nbsp; [1](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-fast-weight-loss-muscle.html)

 **Long-Term Results** 

Four weeks after completing diets, the muscle loss percentages adjust to:

* Very low-calorie diet: 9.4% of total weight loss

* Standard low-calorie diet: 2.9% of total weight loss&amp;nbsp;[1](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-fast-weight-loss-muscle.html)

 **Factors Affecting Muscle Loss** 

The exact percentage varies depending on:

* Speed of weight loss

* Pr otein intake during dieting

* Exercise routine, particularly strength training

* Age and genetics &amp;nbsp;[4](https://cathe.com/lose-weight-much-fat-much-muscle/)

Without proper intervention like strength training and adequate protein intake, sedentary individuals can lose approximately 25% of their weight loss from muscle tissue &amp;nbsp;[2](https://www.winterberrymedical.ca/2021/03/02/lose-the-fat-maintain-the-muscle-4-ways-to-keep-your-strength-while-losing-weight/)

#### Muscle lost in a year is 37X faster with GLP-1  - Lancet Nov 2024

Muscle loss per year: normally 0.8%, with GLP-1 ~30%: = 37X faster

 **Muscle matters: the effects of medically induced weight loss on skeletal muscle** 

Carla M Prado a ∙ Stuart M Phillips b ∙ M Cristina Gonzalez c,d ∙ Steven B Heymsfield d  [ **Behind Paywall** ](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00272-9/abstract)

The importance of skeletal muscle mass is increasingly being recognised in the medical field.1 The crucial roles of skeletal muscle have come to the forefront of public attention due to data on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are effective for weight loss, but can cause substantial muscle loss. Studies suggest muscle loss with these medications (as indicated by decreases in  **fat-free mass &lt;span&gt;[FFM]&lt;/span&gt;) ranges from 25% to 39%**  of the total weight lost over 36–72 weeks. 2 This substantial muscle loss can be largely attributed to the magnitude of weight loss, rather than by an independent effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists, although this hypothesis must be tested. By comparison, non-pharmacological caloric restriction studies with smaller magnitudes of weight loss result in 10–30% FFM losses. 3 In context, on an annual basis, the decline in muscle mass with GLP-1 receptor agonists is several times greater than what would be expected from age-related muscle loss (0·8% per year based on 8% muscle loss per decade from ages 40–70 years). 

Dismissing the importance of muscle loss can create a disconnect between patients&#39; increased awareness of muscle and the role it plays in health, and clinicians who downplay these concerns, affecting adherence to and the development of optimised treatment plans.

#### &quot;High-dose vitamin D appears to help allocate surplus calories to muscle instead of fat tissue, potentially preserving muscle mass&quot;

##### Might taking high-dose Vitamin D with GLP-1 result in less muscle loss?

#### Some weight loss diets also result in bone loss

Not as much bone is needed when the body weighs less, etc [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/some-diets-are-designed-for-we-nMmytc5lT4aILobhVhjPtw%20)

*__First documented in a 2021 clinical trial__

!!!!What percentage of weight loss from diets is due to muscle loss? Asked Perplexity AI Nov 2024
The percentage of muscle loss during weight loss varies based on several key factors:
__Normal Weight vs Overweight Individuals__
__In overweight individuals, 20-30% of total weight loss comes from muscle mass.__ For normal weight individuals, the percentage is higher, with 35% or more of total weight loss coming from muscle tissue ~hs~[https://lifesum.com/nutrition-explained/the-effect-of-protein-intake-on-muscle-maintenance-during-weight-loss|3]
__Impact of Diet Type__
The speed and severity of caloric restriction significantly affects muscle loss:
*Very low-calorie diet (500 calories/day): 18% of initial weight loss is muscle mass
*Standard low-calorie diet (1,250 calories/day): 7.7% of initial weight loss is muscle mass ~hs~ [https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-fast-weight-loss-muscle.html|1]
__Long-Term Results__
Four weeks after completing diets, the muscle loss percentages adjust to:
*Very low-calorie diet: 9.4% of total weight loss
*Standard low-calorie diet: 2.9% of total weight loss~hs~[https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-fast-weight-loss-muscle.html|1]
__Factors Affecting Muscle Loss__
The exact percentage varies depending on:
*Speed of weight loss
*Pr otein intake during dieting
*Exercise routine, particularly strength training
*Age and genetics ~hs~[https://cathe.com/lose-weight-much-fat-much-muscle/|4]
Without proper intervention like strength training and adequate protein intake, sedentary individuals can lose approximately 25% of their weight loss from muscle tissue ~hs~[https://www.winterberrymedical.ca/2021/03/02/lose-the-fat-maintain-the-muscle-4-ways-to-keep-your-strength-while-losing-weight/|2]

!!!!Muscle lost in a year is 37X faster with GLP-1  - Lancet Nov 2024
Muscle loss per year: normally 0.8%, with GLP-1 ~30%: = 37X faster
__Muscle matters: the effects of medically induced weight loss on skeletal muscle__
Carla M Prado a ∙ Stuart M Phillips b ∙ M Cristina Gonzalez c,d ∙ Steven B Heymsfield d  [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00272-9/abstract|__Behind Paywall__]

The importance of skeletal muscle mass is increasingly being recognised in the medical field.1 The crucial roles of skeletal muscle have come to the forefront of public attention due to data on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are effective for weight loss, but can cause substantial muscle loss. Studies suggest muscle loss with these medications (as indicated by decreases in __fat-free mass [FFM]) ranges from 25% to 39%__ of the total weight lost over 36–72 weeks. 2 This substantial muscle loss can be largely attributed to the magnitude of weight loss, rather than by an independent effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists, although this hypothesis must be tested. By comparison, non-pharmacological caloric restriction studies with smaller magnitudes of weight loss result in 10–30% FFM losses. 3 In context, on an annual basis, the decline in muscle mass with GLP-1 receptor agonists is several times greater than what would be expected from age-related muscle loss (0·8% per year based on 8% muscle loss per decade from ages 40–70 years). 

Dismissing the importance of muscle loss can create a disconnect between patients&#39; increased awareness of muscle and the role it plays in health, and clinicians who downplay these concerns, affecting adherence to and the development of optimised treatment plans.
