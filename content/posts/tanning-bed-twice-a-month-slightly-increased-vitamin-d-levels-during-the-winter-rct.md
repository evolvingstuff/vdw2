UVB just strong enough to make a slight reddening

On entire body (not just upper or lower)

 **| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VitaminD levels  | October  | April |
| UVB twice a month | 32 ng | 36 ng |
| UVB - none | 31 ng | 26 ng |** 

 **Notes:**  

* Commerical tanning beds typically have a lot of UVA in addition to UVB

* UVA appears to decrease the effective production of Vitamin D by UVB

* Treatments every 18-22 days (instead of 14)  might have resulted in no change from Oct to April.

* Guess: Each treatment takes 3-15 minutes 

> much longer if use less intense sun or only illuminate one side

* 3X-5X longer times for those who do not produce Vitamin D as efficiently

> elderly, those with darker skins, etc

* 2X-5X longer times also needed for those who need much larger doses to get the same response

> Obese, poor liver, poor gut, smokers, people with diseases which consume Vitamin D - such as Multiple Sclerosis

3 tanning sessions raised vitamin D levels about 4 nanograms for about 4 weeks – July 2016

Exposure to solar ultraviolet B radiation during the summer months is the main source of vitamin D (VD) for people living in northern latitudes. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) whole-body exposures could maintain VD levels in winter. The intervention group received 2 standard erythema doses (SEDs) of NB-UVB exposures every second week from October 2013 to April 2014. In October 2013 serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 78.3 nmol/l in the intervention group (n = 16) and 76.8 nmol/l in the control group (n = 18). By April 2014 the concentrations had increased by 11.7 nmol/l (p = 0.029) in the intervention group and decreased by 11.1 nmol/l (p = 0.022) in the control group. The baseline VD concentration showed a negative correlation (p = 0.012) with body mass index (BMI). In conclusion, a suberythemal NB-UVB dose of 2 SED every second week maintains and even increases serum VD concentrations during the winter. A high BMI seems to predispose subjects to low levels of VD.
