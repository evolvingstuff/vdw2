Ultraviolet-B (UVB) phototherapy for the treatment of vitiligo is an effective first-line choice. However, the cost of multiple doctor visits and the lengthy treatment regimen has resulted in low compliance, limiting access to this safe and effective mode of treatment. Topical Photocil represents an innovative solution to this problem. The drug selectively filters solar radiation to deliver narrow-band UVB to vitiligo lesions. Here, we discuss how this novel topical cream could provide a convenient alternative to artificial light phototherapy.
