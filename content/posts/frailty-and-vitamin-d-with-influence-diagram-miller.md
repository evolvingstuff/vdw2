Slide show Presented Oct 29, 2010

Discusses many different Frailty scales, and likes the following simple one.

## FRAIL

• Fatigue (by self-report)

• Resistance (reported inability to walk up 10 steps without stopping)

• Ambulation (reported inability to walk ¼ mile on own without aids)

• Illnesses (more than 5 illnesses)

• Loss of weight (reported 10+ lb of wt loss in past year)

## Over half of the slides are on the topic of Vitamin D

# Circulating 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels and Frailty in Older Men: The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study.

J Am Geriatr Soc. 2011 Jan;59(1):101-106. [doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03201.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03201.x.) Epub 2010 Dec 16.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and frailty status in older men.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.

SETTING: Six U.S. community-based centers.

PARTICIPANTS: One thousand six hundred six men aged 65 and older.

MEASUREMENTS: 25(OH)D (liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy) and frailty status (criteria similar to those used in the Cardiovascular Health Study) measured at baseline; frailty status assessment repeated an average of 4.6 years later. Frailty status was classified as robust, intermediate, or frail at baseline and robust, intermediate, frail, or dead at follow-up.

RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, men with 25(OH)D levels less than 20.0?ng/mL had 1.5 times higher odds (multivariate odds ratio (MOR)=1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-2.02) of greater frailty status at baseline than men with 25(OH)D levels of 30.0?ng/mL or greater (referent group), whereas frailty status was similar in men with 25(OH)D levels from 20.0 to 29.9?ng/mL and those with levels of 30.0?ng/mL or greater (MOR=1.02, 95% CI=0.78-1.32). However, in 1,267 men not classified as frail at baseline, there was no association between lower baseline 25(OH)D level and odds of greater frailty status at the 4.6-year follow-up. Findings were the same when 25(OH)D was expressed in quartiles or as a continuous variable.

CONCLUSION: Lower levels of 25(OH)D (<20.0?ng/mL) in community-dwelling older men were independently associated with greater evidence of frailty at baseline but did not predict greater risk of greater frailty status at 4.6 years.
