 **Decreased mortality with sun and or altitude  7 studies of 10 to 20 years each, April 2010** 

#### Cancer protection related to solar ultraviolet radiation, altitude and vitamin D  by Daniel P. Hayes

 **Summary from article** 

A whole host of epidemiological studies have reported lower cancer rates and mortality in high-altitude regions. 

These studies are reviewed and discussed in detail. Evidence for the salutary role of vitamin D in protecting against cancer and other maladies will also be reviewed and discussed. 

The dependence of vitamin D production on sunlight and its enhancement with altitude will be demonstrated. 

The hypothesis is advanced and developed that the lower cancer rates observed at high altitudes arise from enhanced sunlight-induced vitamin D production levels. 

Protective vitamin D mechanisms which support this hypothesis as well as other supportive medical evidence are also presented.

#### The Studies

Radon study of 1600 US counties -  **lung cancer**  decreases by 7.5% for every 1260 feet in altitude,

Argonne National Laboratory study  -looking at 40 factors in states, (‘‘higher and sunnier”) had fewer observed malignancy decreases.

University of Pennsylvania study - 20 year lower mortality rates were found in higher altitude counties.

Analyses of UICC and WHO cancer data - statistically signi?cant reductions in cancer at the higher altitudes.

Analysis of the United States Metropolitan Mortality Report  10 year -  high-altitude protection against cancer 

Leukemia and other cancer studies  20 year - signi?cant de?cits in mortality from cancers other than leukemia in 53 United States counties with most of their land mass above 3000 feet elevation,
