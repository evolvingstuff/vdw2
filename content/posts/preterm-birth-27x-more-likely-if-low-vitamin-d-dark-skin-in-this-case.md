#### Vitamin D Status as an Important Predictor of Preterm Birth in a Cohort of Black Women

Nutrients 2023, 15(21), 4637; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15214637

Vitamin D deficiency (25 (OH)D < 20 ng/mL) is a modifiable risk factor that has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (PTB) (<37 weeks gestation). Black women are at a high risk for vitamin D deficiency due to higher melanin levels. Vitamin D sufficiency may be protective against PTB risk in Black women. Black participants between 8 and 25 weeks of gestation were included in this nested case–control study. The sample consisted of women who had either PTBs (n = 57) or term births, were selected based on maternal age compared to those who had PTBs (n = 118), and had blood samples available between 8 and 25 weeks of gestation. The women completed questionnaires about depressive symptoms and smoking behavior and had blood collected to determine their vitamin D levels. Gestational age at birth, hypertensive disorders, and body mass index (BMI) were collected from the medical records. 

The odds of PTB were increased by  **3.34 times**  for participants with vitamin D deficiency after adjusting for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and depressive symptoms. Vitamin D assessment and supplementation may be an important intervention for preventing PTB in pregnant Black women.

 <span style="color:orange;"> **Adjusted odds ratio clipped from PDF** </span>

Vitamin D showed a slightly weaker effect ( **OR = 2.74** , 95% CI: 1.35–5.54) after propensity score weights were applied to account for maternal age, gestational age at blood draw, and confounders (depressive symptoms and HDP). However, the overall results are similar among all three logistic regression models.

!!!!Vitamin D Status as an Important Predictor of Preterm Birth in a Cohort of Black Women

Vitamin D deficiency (25 (OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL) is a modifiable risk factor that has been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (PTB) (&lt;37 weeks gestation). Black women are at a high risk for vitamin D deficiency due to higher melanin levels. Vitamin D sufficiency may be protective against PTB risk in Black women. Black participants between 8 and 25 weeks of gestation were included in this nested case–control study. The sample consisted of women who had either PTBs (n = 57) or term births, were selected based on maternal age compared to those who had PTBs (n = 118), and had blood samples available between 8 and 25 weeks of gestation. The women completed questionnaires about depressive symptoms and smoking behavior and had blood collected to determine their vitamin D levels. Gestational age at birth, hypertensive disorders, and body mass index (BMI) were collected from the medical records. 
The odds of PTB were increased by __3.34 times__ for participants with vitamin D deficiency after adjusting for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and depressive symptoms. Vitamin D assessment and supplementation may be an important intervention for preventing PTB in pregnant Black women.

Vitamin D showed a slightly weaker effect (__OR = 2.74__, 95% CI: 1.35–5.54) after propensity score weights were applied to account for maternal age, gestational age at blood draw, and confounders (depressive symptoms and HDP). However, the overall results are similar among all three logistic regression models.
