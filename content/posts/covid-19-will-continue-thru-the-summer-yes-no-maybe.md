 **Temperature dependence of COVID-19 transmission** 

"Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate  **should significantly decrease**  as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies."

 **Susceptible supply limits the role of climate in the COVID-19 pandemic** 

"summer temperatures will  **not substantially**  limit pandemic growth."

 **Predict the next moves of COVID-19: reveal the temperate and tropical countries scenario** 

"However, some literature predicted that this might not to be true, rather irrespective of weather conditions there might be a continuous spread

and death."

"Moreover, a large number of asymptotic COVID-19 carrier in both temperate and tropical countries may re-outbreak in the coming winter"

 **[Variety of interesting charts by a computer scientist at University of College London](http://nrg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mjh/covid19/)** 

   * Reported (not actual) cases vs Italy: Spain 8 days behind, UK and US 14 days behind

   * Far slower growth rate in warm countries (higher vitamin D?)

 **I notice the outbreak of COVID-19 in many countries (India and Iran for example) which are hot (>100 degrees F).    
It does not appear that high heat of summer will prevent the Coronavirus from spreading.   
The previous Coronavirus are seasonal (Influenza, colds).    
This one does not appears to be so now.  
I get the impression that > 40 ng is needed to stop this Coronavirus,   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whereas previous ones were stopped by ~>20 ng - available to most in the summer  
One model predicts that COVID-19 will become seasonal in a few years  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after becoming [100X more virulent](/posts/model-predicts-100-x-worse-coronavirus-outbreak-in-the-fall-of-2020) this fall
