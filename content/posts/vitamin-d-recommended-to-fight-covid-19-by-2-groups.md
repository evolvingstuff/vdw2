#### Over 100 Scientists, Doctors, & Leading Authorities Call For Increased Vitamin D Use To Combat COVID-19 - Dec 7

 **[web page](https://vitamind4all.org/letter.html)  - recommends <span style="color:#F00;">4,000 IU</span> of Vitamin D daily** 

##### Nice step in right direction, but... by VitaminDWiki

 **4,000 IU** 

* Many Medical Societies are afraid of taking more than 4,000 IU of vitamin D

   * [4,000 IU of Vitamin D is OK - 19 organizations agree - 2018](/posts/4000-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-ok-19-organizations-agree-2018) 5 say 10,000 IU is OK

* 32% of the individuals signing the document report taking more than 4,000 IU daily

* There have been no documented cases of problems resulting from 10,000 IU daily for a year

   * [Overview Toxicity of vitamin D](/posts/overview-toxicity-of-vitamin-d) - note: Vitamin D is far less "toxic" than COVID-19 vaccines

 **But they indicate that <span style="color:#F00;">6,200 IU</span>, not 4,000 IU, is needed to get most healthy individuals <span style="color:#00F;">>30 ng/ml</span>** 

 **However, Example of many observations that <span style="color:#00F;">>40 ng/ml</span> is needed**

 **To get a long-term response >40ng/ml <span style="color:#F00;">12,000 IU</span> daily would be needed**

[Chart which is the source of the extrapolation](/posts/same-dose-of-vitamin-d-for-everyone-is-virtually-impossible)

 **With daily dosing it would take 4 months to get most people <span style="color:#00F;">>40 ng</span>** 

Note: [chart is for 10,000 IU daily](/posts/10000-iu-of-vitamin-d-for-7-years-with-no-excessive-calcium-in-4800-patients), which is close to 12,000 IU

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/10-000-iu-5-months.jpg" alt="image" width="250">

Note: [a 2nd chart](/posts/10000-iu-of-vitamin-d-for-7-years-with-no-excessive-calcium-in-4800-patients) shows it might take 7 months for 5,000 IU to get most people >40 ng

 **70% of all Vitamin D/COVID-19 Trials are using at least <span style="color:#F00;">100,000 IU</span> in the first week**

 **Response to weekly or monthly dosing** 

* [Infrequent Vitamin D dosing appears to be BETTER than daily dosing](/posts/better-than-daily)

* [100,000 IU monthly took 4 months to get to half of the individuals to 40 ng](/posts/graph-of-weekly-response-to-monthly-vitamin-d-supplementation)

* [70,000 IU then 35,000 IU weekly got half to 40 ng in 3 weeks](/posts/35000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-during-3rd-quarter-pregnancy-rct)

* [50,000 IU weekly for all >40 in 10 weeks](/posts/nursing-home-residents-need-vitamin-d-4000-iu-daily-or-50000-iu-weekly)

 **Response to Loading Dose** 

* [Overview Loading of vitamin D](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d)

* [200,000 IU loading dose got 40% above 40 ng](https://VitaminDWiki.com/Overview+Loading+of+vitamin+D#Response_to_weekly_or_biweekly_dosing)
