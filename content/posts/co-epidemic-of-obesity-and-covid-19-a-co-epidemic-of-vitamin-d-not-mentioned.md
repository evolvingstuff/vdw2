#### Vitamin D Deficiency in Obesity (section in PDF)

Based on a recent meta-analysis of 8176 COVID-19 patients participating in 26 studies, individuals with severe COVID-19 presented 65% (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.30-2.09) more vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) compared with mild caseso f the infection. Interestingly, a serum vitamin D concentration of less than 75 nmol/L increased hospitalization by 81% (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.41-2.21) and mortality by 82% (OR: 1.82,95%CI: 1.06-2.58) from COVID-19 <sup>[156]</sup>. However, vitamin D deficiency (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.80-1.88) was not associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection <sup>[156, 157]</sup>.

At the molecular level, vitamin D and its receptor (VDR), which is expressed on immune (B cells, T cells, and antigen- presenting cells) and pulmonary epithelial cells, plays an important role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses <sup>[158]</sup>. Vitamin D induces the transcriptional expression of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidins and defensins. Cathelicidins act by destructing the bacterial cell membranes and the enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, while defensins enhance chemotaxis of inflammatory cells through increased capillary permeability <sup>[158]</sup>. At the same time, vitamin D decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-a, which are involved in the development of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 that precedes ARDS <sup>[159]</sup>.

Remarkably, obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency due to the lipophilic nature ofthe adipose tissue which acts as an isolator of vitamin D rather than a depot <sup>[160]</sup>. Other mechanisms linking higher BMI to lower vitamin D include the lesser skin exposure to sunlight, the diminished outdoor physical activity, the lower vitamin D intake, and the reduced intestinal absorption of vitamin D <sup>[161, 162]</sup>.

Interestingly, vitamin D deficiency has been found to be an independent risk factor for the development of ARDS, its severity, and mortality. Notably, a bulk of recent studies have reported that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severe COVID-19 and a higher risk for progression to ARDS <sup>[163]</sup>. Interestingly, the biologic pathways involved in the pleiotropic actions of vitamin D intersect with the dysregulated mechanisms during COVID-19-related ARDS, providing some possible explanations behind this association. Vitamin D and its metabolites are implicated in the ACE2 expression, modulate genes associated with thrombotic pathways, particularly those related to angiogenesis, activate the lung-protective cathelicidin, and downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines blocking the cytokine storm, such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, IL- 12, and IFN-y <sup>[163]</sup>. Collectively, vitamin D deficiency may be a potential link between obesity and COVID-19-associated ARDS <sup>[164]</sup>. However, the exact efficacy ofvitamin D supplementation for the prevention of or as a potential adjunct therapeutic option for COVID-19 remains to be determined. Currently, a number of RCTs are actively investigating the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation.
