#### TMDs might be be associated with low vitamin D, more studies needed - Review Oct 2022

 **Temporomandibular Disorders and Vitamin D Deficiency: What Is the Linkage between These Conditions? A Systematic Review** 

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11(21), 6231; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11216231

Although a growing body of literature has been emphasizing the role of vitamin D in oral health, there is still a gap of knowledge regarding the correlation between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and vitamin D. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the linkage between hypovitaminosis D and TMDs to map the current literature in this field. On 10 September 2022, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from the date of their inception to identify the studies that had assessed patients with TMDs. The primary outcome assessed in this review was the relationship between hypovitaminosis D and TMDs. Out of the  **329 studies identified, 13 studies met the eligibility criteria**  and were included in the present work. 

Seven studies assessed the relationship between vitamin D and TMDs, reporting that vitamin D serum levels are lower in patients with TMDs. Our results suggested that **vitamin D receptor**  (VDR) polymorphisms might have a role in TMDs’ development. However, the quality assessed underlined that only one study did not present a serious risk of bias. Further good-quality studies are needed to clarify the linkage between vitamin D deficiency and TMDs, but the evidence currently available has suggested potential correlations.

#### Vitamin D and Temporomandibular Disorders: What Do We Know So Far? - 2021

Background and aims. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin with the aid of ultraviolet-B radiation, playing a variety of roles in the body. Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a group of pathological conditions involving the temporomandibular joints as well as the masticatory muscles and other surrounding tissues. In the present narrative review, we investigated the potential role of vitamin D in the etiology of temporomandibular disorders in order to determine whether the current knowledge supports 25-hidroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) supplementation in temporomandibular disorders associated with insufficient or deficient levels of vitamin D. 

Methods. A literature research was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases, and a total of 10 articles were included for analysis. 

Results. Among the observational studies published to date, investigating the role for vitamin D in the etiology of TMDs, six of them suggest that there is a connection between the two aspects. In this context, patients suffering from TMD, with deficient levels of vitamin D (<30 ng/mL), are most likely to benefit from supplementation, whereas individuals with vitamin D level >50ng/mL probably have little benefit from supplementation.

Conclusion. Vitamin D might be a safe, simple, and potentially beneficial way to prevent TMDs or to reduce pain; however, more randomized and placebo-controlled trials are required before any firm conclusions can be drawn.

* “The prevalence of TMDs among the general population is considered to be 5%"

* "There are studies suggesting that approximately 5%–60% of the population experience at least one of the signs of TMDs”

 **Possible pathways of interconnection between temporomandibular disorders and low levels of vitamin D** 

A—VDR gene polymorphism, 

B—inflammatory processes, 

C—neuroprotective function,

D—calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) metabolism
