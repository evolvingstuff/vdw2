#### Background

Primary care practitioners are on the front lines dealing with today’s public health interests in vitamin D. Decisions about screening for vitamin D status, interpreting laboratory measures, and determining interventions such as supplementation lend themselves to evidence-based approaches to decision making in primary care practice, but such approaches may be misunderstood or overlooked.

#### Overview

Through its Vitamin D Initiative, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) leads several efforts to advance scientific understanding of vitamin D and health. 

On December 2-3, 2014, ODS is sponsoring a conference and webinar titled, “Vitamin D: Moving Toward Evidence-based Decision Making in Primary Care,” at NIH (Bethesda, MD), in collaboration with federal cosponsors. This conference will provide a forum to identify and discuss issues focused on evidence-based decision making for vitamin D in primary care settings. Also, research gaps and data needs relevant to improving approaches and reducing uncertainties surrounding vitamin D will be highlighted.

#### Conference Presentation and Discussion Topics

How do we evaluate and apply evidence for primary care decision making?

What is the view from the front lines of clinical practice?

How do we think about risk of nutritional inadequacy?

What do we know about vitamin D intake and supplement use?

What are issues surrounding laboratory measurement of serum 25(OH)D?

#### Who should attend?

All interested persons, especially clinical educators, those who develop clinical recommendations, health care providers, and researchers.

#### Cosponsors

Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)

National Institute on Aging (NIA) of NIH

#### Registration information

[Registration and Cost](https://events-support.com/events/Vitamin_D_Primary_Care%20)
