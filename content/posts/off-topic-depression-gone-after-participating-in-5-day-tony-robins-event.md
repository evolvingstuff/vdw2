#### The Exciting Emergence of Regenerative Medicine - Mercola May 2022

 **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/emergence-of-regenerative-medicine-pdf.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>** 

* "A Stanford clinical research study of Robbins’ “Date With Destiny” program found 100% of participants with clinical depression were symptom-free 30 days after completion of the five-and-a-half-day course"

* "During his career, Robbins has coached more than 10 million people through group events, and more than 100 million digitally. Pre-COVID, he would visit, on average, 125 cities in more than a dozen countries each year. "

* Robins before going online..." would normally go see a quarter of a million people over most years, some years a million people, but now, we had one the other day for six days; 800,000 people signed up, and then there are people joining them because it's in their home."

 **You can get a taste of the 6 day event**  People can see it if they go to Netflix — a version of one. ‘Tony Robbins: I'm Not Your Guru,’ compresses it. It’s an hour and 45 minutes. *Note Netflix gives a 30 day free trial
