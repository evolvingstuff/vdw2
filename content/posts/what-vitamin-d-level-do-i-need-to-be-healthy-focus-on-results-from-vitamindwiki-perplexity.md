#### What vitamin D level do I need to be healthy - focus on results from VitaminDWiki

To maintain health, vitamin D levels should generally be above 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), which is considered sufficient for bone health in most people. However, there is some debate about the optimal level of vitamin D for overall health. Some researchers and health organizations recommend maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) to ensure adequate health benefits   [2](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=4566&download=y&page=Vitamin%20D%20measurements%20vary%20with%20the%20same%20sample%20of%20blood%20–%20March%202014)  [3](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=1947)  [6](https://VitaminDWiki.com/dl974)

For instance, the Endocrine Society suggests that vitamin D deficiency is defined as a 25(OH)D level below 20 ng/mL, and insufficiency as a level between 20-29 ng/mL. They recommend maintaining levels between 30-100 ng/mL for optimal health, with a caution that levels greater than 100 ng/mL should probably be avoided to prevent potential toxicity  [5](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1434)

It's important to note that individual requirements for vitamin D may vary based on factors such as age, skin color, geographic location, and sun exposure. For example, older adults, individuals with darker skin, and those living in higher latitudes may require higher vitamin D intake to maintain sufficient levels   [1](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=13329&download=y)  [3](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=1947)   [6](https://VitaminDWiki.com/dl974)

In summary, while there is some variability in the recommended levels, aiming for a vitamin D level above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) is often suggested to ensure adequate health benefits, with the upper limit of normal being around 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L) to avoid potential adverse effects [5](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1434)

#### Asked: What vitamin D level do I need to be healthy

Determining the optimal level of vitamin D for health involves navigating a range of expert opinions and guidelines. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2010 suggested that a vitamin D level of 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or higher is adequate for good bone health, considering levels below 20 ng/mL as indicative of vitamin D deficiency &nbsp; [1](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893)

This perspective is supported by the fact that vitamin D is crucial for maintaining strong bones, among other health benefits  &nbsp; [1](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893)  &nbsp; [3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/normal-vitamin-d-levels)

However, the Endocrine Society in 2011 recommended higher minimum blood levels of vitamin D, suggesting that levels of 30 ng/mL are the minimum for sufficiency, and to ensure adequacy, levels between 40 and 60 ng/mL for both children and adults are preferable  &nbsp;[1](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-d-whats-right-level-2016121910893)

This recommendation is echoed by Root Functional Medicine, which advocates for optimal vitamin D levels between 50-70 ng/mL, especially for overall wellness and prevention  &nbsp; [8](https://rootfunctionalmedicine.com/optimalvitamindlevels)

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamin D, suggesting intakes based on minimal sun exposure. For adults, the RDA is 600 International Units (IU) for those aged 1-70 years and 800 IU for those over 70 years  &nbsp; [2](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/)

The Endocrine Society also notes that adults might need at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/mL  &nbsp;[2](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/)

Medical News Today mentions that for adults, a level of 20 ng/mL or above is generally considered adequate, with levels below 20 ng/mL being too low for bone health and overall health &nbsp; [3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/normal-vitamin-d-levels)

They also highlight that levels above 50 ng/mL may be too high and could affect a person's health negatively  &nbsp;[3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/normal-vitamin-d-levels)

Mount Sinai experts recommend a level between 20 and 40 ng/mL, with some suggesting a range between 30 and 50 ng/mL  &nbsp;[4](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/25-hydroxy-vitamin-d-test)

This variability underscores the ongoing debate and research into the optimal levels of vitamin D for health.In summary, while there is some variation in the recommended levels of vitamin D for optimal health, a general consensus exists around maintaining levels above 20 ng/mL to support bone health, with some experts advocating for higher levels between  **30 and 60 ng/mL, or even 50-70 ng/mL** , for broader health benefits. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate vitamin D level and supplementation strategy based on individual health needs and risk factors.
