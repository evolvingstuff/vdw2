Migraine is among the ten neurological conditions accounting for the greatest disability in the whole population, the leading cause of disability for children and adolescents aged 5–19 years, and the second cause of disability for adults aged 20–59 years. Magnesium deficiency is also a very common condition resulting from diverse reasons, including insufficient dietary consumption or increased loss through the gastrointestinal or renal system. Accumulated evidence from case reports, case–control studies, observational studies, and randomized, placebo-controlled trials has shown the effectiveness of magnesium supplementation in alleviating migraine, both acutely and chronically. Mechanisms that may help explain these results include the potential link between magnesium deficit and spreading cortical depression, vascular changes, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, nervous excitation, neurotransmitter release, and electrolyte imbalances. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the available evidence on the links between magnesium and migraine, considering the role of magnesium in the pathogenesis of migraine and the utility of magnesium in its prevention and treatment.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Magnesium has been considered <strong>for over thirty years</strong> in the treatment of migraine, a common and disabling chronic condition. This ion has multiple effects on the nervous system, including those derived from its interaction with NMDA receptors, the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels, and a reduction in oxidative stress, inflammation, and the release of substance P. These mechanisms may contribute to the role of magnesium in controlling migraine. Magnesium is also a supplement with relatively rare serious side effects and shows promise in addressing the progression of migraine symptoms. While the current data support the benefits of both intravenous and oral magnesium administration for the management of acute migraine episodes requiring immediate treatment as well as in the prevention of migraine, larger RCTs are needed to further validate the effectiveness of magnesium as a treatment option. Although these trials are needed, considering the evidence from the last decades, magnesium could be included in guidelines and protocols for the treatment of both acute and chronic migraine, as indicated by the studies included in this review. Magnesium supplementation could be considered as an add-on therapy when other treatments are minimally effective. An initial therapeutic trial with magnesium, followed, if necessary, by other established and new treatments is also possible.</p><p>Thus, oral magnesium supplements are a cost-effective and well-tolerated option for treating migraine patients, alone or in combination with other compounds, which may indeed help decrease the frequency of attacks, lower treatment costs, and minimize the risk of severe side effects.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/magnesium-and-migraine-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382336"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382336",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382336"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382336"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382336"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382336"></script></body></html>
