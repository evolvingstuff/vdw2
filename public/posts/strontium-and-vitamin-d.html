Patients were randomized to SR 2 g/day (n = 76) or alendronate 70 mg/week (n = 76) supplemented daily with 1200 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D. The main outcome measure was percent change in lumbar spine and total hip BMD from baseline. Mean BMD (+/- SD) increased by 5.8 +/- 3.7% at the lumbar spine and 3.5 +/- 2.8% at the total hip with SR compared to increases of 4.5 +/- 3.4 % and 2.7 +/- 3.2%, respectively, with alendronate. Increases in BMD in the SR group are consistent with 1-year results from two pivotal fracture studies in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. SR was associated with a 22% greater increase in BMD at the lumbar spine (p = 0.033) and 23% greater increase at the total hip (p = 0.002) than alendronate. New fractures were observed in 7 SR and 10 alendronate patients. Height loss (-0.1 +/- 0.7 cm) was less with SR compared with alendronate (-0.5 +/- 0.8 cm) (p = 0.026). SR was also associated with significantly greater reductions in back pain and analgesic use scores. Adverse events were experienced by 28 (37%) patients in the SR group and 38 (50%) patients in the alendronate group, none of which were serious. In men with osteoporosis, SR produced significantly greater mean increases in BMD over 12 months compared with alendronate, an agent already approved for male osteoporosis. Mean increases in BMD with SR in men were similar to those previously documented for this agent in postmenopausal women, suggesting that similar benefits on anti-fracture efficacy may be expected.

Bone density measurements show that more than half of these patients have osteoporosis. The notion that it is too late to start treatment in a late stage of the disease forms a barrier to treatment. The aim of this article is to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic options for osteoporosis in the elderly, with a view to reducing the incidence of fractures. Although most studies of fracture reduction with medical treatment were not designed for the &ldquo;geriatric&rdquo; population, the average age of participants in most clinical trials was about 70 years. Nowadays, clinicians can choose from several effective treatments for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in high-risk postmenopausal women. Data on the antifracture potential of calcium/vitamin D, raloxifene, bisphosphonates, strontium ralenate, and parathyroid hormone are now available. In all major studies patients also received calcium and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonates and** strontium ranelate **are good choices for first- or second-line treatment, while for the time being parathyroid hormone should only be used for the second-line treatment of osteoporosis in the elderly. The ease of use of bisphosphonates, with once weekly, once monthly, or intravenous administration, may be advantageous for elderly patients already taking multiple medications.

Osteoporotic fracture risk is multifactorial, and often involves the balance between bone strength and propensity for falling.</p><p>OBJECTIVE: To present an overview of the available evidence, located primarily by Medline searches up to April, 2009, for the different management strategies aimed at reducing the risk of falls and osteoporotic fractures in the elderly.</p><p>RESULTS: Frailty is an independent predictor of falls, hip fractures, hospitalisation, disability and death in the elderly that is receiving increasing attention. Non-pharmacological strategies to reduce fall risk can prevent osteoporotic fractures. Exercise programmes, especially those involving high doses of exercise and incorporating balance training, have been shown to be effective. Many older people, especially the very elderly and those living in care institutions, have vitamin D inadequacy. In appropriate patients and given in sufficient doses, vitamin D and calcium supplementation is effective in reducing both falls and osteoporotic fractures, including hip fractures. Specific anti-osteoporosis drugs are underused, even in those most at risk of osteoporotic fracture. The evidence base for the efficacy of most such drugs in the elderly is incomplete, particularly with regard to nonvertebral and hip fractures. The evidence base is perhaps most complete for the relatively recently introduced drug,** strontium ranelate **. Non-adherence to treatment is a substantial problem, and may be exacerbated by the requirements for safe oral administration of bisphosphonates.</p><p>CONCLUSION: Evidence-based strategies are available for reducing osteoporotic fracture risk in the elderly, and include exercise training, vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and use of evidence-based anti-osteoporotic drugs. A positive and determined approach to optimising the use of such strategies could reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures in this high-risk group.

Falls, co-morbidities and co-medications compound the risk of fracture in senile osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis is expected to increase with increasing life expectancy, and the associated fractures - particularly hip fractures - will lead to significant demands on health resources. Treatment of senile osteoporosis can include pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. Calcium and vitamin D dietary supplementation is a relatively low-cost way of reducing the risk of fracture. Pharmacological interventions with risedronate, zoledronic acid, or teriparatide have been shown to reduce vertebral fracture risk in osteoporosis patients over the age of 75. Zoledronic acid has been shown to reduce fracture risk in frail patients with recent hip fracture. In the oldest old (patients over 80),** strontium ranelate **is the first agent with documented anti-fracture efficacy for both non-vertebral and vertebral fracture and documented sustained efficacy over 5 years. Falls prevention is an essential component of any strategy for decreasing fracture risk in old age. Currently, senile osteoporosis is under-diagnosed and under-treated, but age should not be a barrier to intervention.

A total of 216 male Ross broiler chicks were used in a 28-day broiler trial to assess D3 and strontium supplementation on performance, nutrient retention, bone composition and bone mass. Treatments included an industry-standard control diet and five additional diets where vitamin D3 was added at 5,000, 20,000 or 35,000 iu/kg and strontium was added at 0 or 1200mg/kg in a 3 x 2 factorial design. Broiler chickens supplemented with strontium and additional vitamin D3 did not increase bodyweight however there was a significant improvement in feed efficiency at medium levels of vitamin D3 and although not statistically significant, there was also an improvement in FCR with strontium supplementation at normal vitamin D3 concentrations.</p><p>Strontium supplementation at normal levels of vitamin D3 significantly (P&lt;0.01) increased</p><ul><li><p>calcium,</p></li><li><p>phosphorus,</p></li><li><p>sodium,</p></li><li><p>potassium and</p></li><li><p>magnesium retention.</p></li></ul><p>A high concentration of vitamin D3 produced a significant improvement in energy (AME), protein and dry matter utilization in the broiler chicken however paradoxically there was a detrimental effect of high vitamin D3 on bodyweight and feed efficiency which was partially ameliorated by strontium supplementation.</p><p>Strontium addition did not change bone mass but did change bone composition.</p><p>High levels of vitamin D3 significantly (P&lt;0.01) reduced bone ash content and increased strontium content of bone.</p><p>In conclusion both vitamin D3 and strontium have the potential to positively influence the performance, mineral retention and bone characteristics of broiler chicks. However, as with calcium and phosphorus,** vitamin D3 and strontium interact **and so more research is required with strontium on the optimum dose rate and its relationship with vitamin D3, calcium, phosphorus and IGF-1 in broiler nutrition.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/back-pain.html><span class=tag>back pain</span></a>
