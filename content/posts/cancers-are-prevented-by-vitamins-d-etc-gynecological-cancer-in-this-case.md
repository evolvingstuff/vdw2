The combination of vitamin A and D derivatives with classical chemotherapeutic treatments results in more satisfactory outcomes. The use of drug combinations, such as 9cUAB130 with carboplatin and cisplatin with TAC-101, shows enhanced cytotoxic effects and reductions in ovarian tumor volume compared to single-drug treatments. Combining cisplatin with calcitriol and progesterone increases VDR expression, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of anticancer therapy in ovarian cancer. The effectiveness of vitamin derivatives in anticancer treatment may vary depending on the characteristics of the tumor and the cell line from which it originated. An increase in thiamine intake of one unit is associated with an 18% decrease in HPV infection. Higher intake of vitamin C by 50 mg/day is linked to a lower risk of cervical neoplasia. Beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E are associated with risk reductions of 12%, 15%, and 9% in endometrial cancer, respectively. A balanced daily intake of vitamins is important, as both deficiency and excess can influence cancer development. It has been observed that there is a U-shaped relationship between group B vitamins and metabolic markers and clinical outcomes.
