#### Asked Claude AI: Which cancers appear to be prevented or treated by vitamin D

 **Based on PDF of Overview of Cancer and Vitamin D + Cancer Dec 2024** 

Based on reviewing this comprehensive document about vitamin D and cancer, here are the key cancers that appear to be prevented or treated by vitamin D:

Major Cancers with Strong Evidence:

1. Colorectal Cancer

> 25% less likely with good vitamin D levels

> Death from colon cancer 8X less likely with good vitamin D levels

> Multiple meta-analyses show preventive effects

1. Breast Cancer

> Risk decreased 16% for every extra ng of vitamin D

> Mortality reduced 60% with vitamin D levels above 60 ng/mL

> Treatment outcomes improved with vitamin D supplementation

1. Prostate Cancer

> Death 40% less likely with vitamin D levels above 40 ng/mL

> Risk cut in half by consuming vitamin D along with other nutrients

> Treatment effectiveness enhanced with vitamin D

1. Lung Cancer

> Death rates 40-60% lower with high vitamin D levels

> Risk decreases 5% for every 2.5 ng increase in vitamin D

> Up to 7X more deadly if poor vitamin D genes

1. Melanoma/Skin Cancer

> 25X more likely with low vitamin D

> Better survival rates with higher vitamin D levels

> Particularly strong connection with UV exposure and vitamin D production

 **Other Cancers with Evidence of Benefit:** 

* Pancreatic Cancer (55% less likely with optimal vitamin D)

* Bladder Cancer (60% less likely with high vitamin D)

* Lymphoma (survival rates improved with adequate vitamin D)

* Ovarian Cancer (37% less likely with high vitamin D)

* Liver Cancer (30% less risky with vitamin D above 30 ng/mL)

 **Key Points:** 

Prevention typically requires 2,000-5,000 IU of vitamin D daily

Treatment may need >8,000 IU daily

Blood levels above 40-60 ng/mL appear optimal for cancer prevention

Vitamin D works through multiple mechanisms to fight cancer:

* Inhibits cancer cell growth

* Reduces metastasis

* Stimulates cell differentiation

* Induces cancer cell death

* Prevents tumor blood vessel formation

* Reduces inflammation

 **[How Vitamin D Works to Help Prevent Cancer](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/vitamin-d-works-help-prevent-cancer/?utm_source=newsletter-main&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsletters)** 

* Inhibits cancer cell growth and proliferation

* Reduces cancer metastasis

* Stimulates maturation of healthy cells (differentiation)

* Induces death of cancer cells (apoptosis or programmed cell death)

* Prevents blood vessel growth in tumors (angiogenesis)

* Prevents inflammation associated with cancer

* Reduces the risk of incidence and/or death due to cancer

* Cancer and Cancer therapy often lower vitamin D levels

   * Lower Vitamin D levels increase the risk of many health problems

in which she mentions the next 5-year trial underway with <span style="color:#00F;">2,000 IU of vitamin D</span>

 **Breast Cancer details from the study** 

For years 2-4

Placebo: 8 Breast Cancers out of 266 women

1100 IU vitamin D + Calcium 4 Breast Cancers out of 403 women

That is 8/266 ==> 4/403 with vitamin D

So roughly 3% ==> 1% with 1100 IU of vitamin D

about a 3X reduction for Breast Cancer(vs 4X reduction for all Cancers)

#### Cancer Factoids from The Body, by Bill Bryson, 2019

* They (Cancers) have evolved to avoid detection,” says Vormoor. “They can hide from drugs. They can develop resistance. (VitaminDWiki also believes that many have also learned to hide.

* Something we have only recently realized is that before cancers metastasize, they are able to prepare the ground for an invasion in distant target organs, probably through some form of chemical signaling. “What this means,” Vormoor says, “is that when cancer cells spread to other organs, they don’t just turn up and hope for the best. They already have a base camp.

* Viruses and bacteria cause cancers, too. The World Health Organization 2011 estimated that 6 percent of cancers in the developed world but 22 percent in low- and middle-income countries are attributable to viruses alone.

* A significant fraction of childhood cancer deaths come not from the cancer itself but from the treatments for it.
