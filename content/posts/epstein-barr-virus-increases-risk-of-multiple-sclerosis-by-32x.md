#### [Epstein-Barr virus a likely leading cause of multiple sclerosis](https://www.mdedge.com/neurology/article/250759/multiple-sclerosis/epstein-barr-virus-likely-leading-cause-multiple?channel=39313%3Fecd%3DWNL_eve_220115_mdedge) MDEdge

* "EBV is common and infects about 95% of adults. Most individuals are already infected with the virus by age 18 or 20 years, making it difficult to study uninfected populations, said Dr. Ascherio."

* "The investigators used stored blood samples (of US military) to determine the relation between EBV infection and MS over a 20-year period from 1993 to 2013."

* " **Only one of the 801 MS case patients had no serologic evidence of EBV** "

* "The hazard ratio for MS between EBV seroconversion versus persistent EBV seronegative was 32.4 (95% CI, 4.3-245.3; P < .001)."

* "It’s not clear why only some people infected with EBV go on to develop MS, he said."
