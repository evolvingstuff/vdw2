 **A few of the problems with this study** 

1. Does not consider topical or spray forms of Vitamin D

1. Does not mention the importance of co-factors such as Magnesium and Vitamin K

1. Does not mention the importance of time of day nor season in the amount of time in the sun 

1. Considers 30 ng of vitamin D to be enough for sports – many others consider 50 ng

1. Says that >72 ng can be toxic,.VitaminDWiki is unaware of a single toxicity case <150 ng

1. Appears to be unaware of Vitamin D genes in the body (outside of liver and kidney)

1. Considers 12 week intervention trials to be adequate – when in reality the benefits might start to until 10  or even 20 weeks – depending on the individual.
