 **Key Messages** 

* Cost-effective primary prevention strategies to reduce preterm birth (PTB) are required to reduce the ~15 million preterm ba­bies born every year worldwide. Nutritional interventions may offer a promising solution.

* The strongest evidence to date for a nutritional solution to re­duce PTB exists for omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggests that women with low levels of omega-3 in early pregnancy may benefit from supplementation.

* Recent findings suggest that determining an individual wom­an&#39;s polyunsaturated fatty acid status in early pregnancy may be a precise way to inform recommendations to reduce her risk of PTB.

Worldwide, around 15 million preterm babies are born annu­ally, and despite intensive research, the specific mechanisms triggering preterm birth (PTB) remain unclear. Cost-effective primary prevention strategies to reduce PTB are required, and nutritional interventions offer a promising alternative. Nutri­ents contribute to a variety of mechanisms that are potentially important to preterm delivery, such as infection, inflam­mation, oxidative stress, and muscle contractility. Several ob­servational studies have explored the association between dietary nutrients and/or dietary patterns and PTB, often with contrasting results. Randomized trial evidence on the effects of supplementation with zinc, multiple micronutrients (iron and folic acid), and vitamin D is promising; however, results are inconsistent, and many studies are not adequately pow­ered for outcomes of PTB. Large-scale clinical trials with PTB as the primary outcome are needed before any firm conclu­sions can be drawn for these nutrients. 

The strongest evi­dence to date for a nutritional solution exists for omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), key nutri­ents in fish. In 2018, a Cochrane Review (including 70 studies) showed that prenatal supplementation with omega-3 LCPU­FAs reduced the risk of PTB and early PTB (EPTB) compared with no omega-3 supplementation. However, the largest tri­al of omega-3 supplementation in pregnancy, the Omega-3 to Reduce the Incidence of Prematurity (ORIP) trial (n = 5,544), showed no reduction in EPTB and a reduction in PTB only in a prespecified analysis of singleton pregnancies. 

Ex­ploratory analyses from the ORIP trial found that women with low baseline total omega-3 status were at higher risk of EPTB, and that this risk was substantially reduced with omega-3 supplementation. In contrast, women with replete or high baseline total omega-3 status were already at low risk of EPTB and additional omega-3 supplementation increased the risk of EPTB compared to control. These findings suggest that determining an individual woman&#39;s PUFA status may be the most precise way to inform recommendations to reduce her risk of PTB.

*Cost-effective primary prevention strategies to reduce preterm birth (PTB) are required to reduce the ~15 million preterm ba­bies born every year worldwide. Nutritional interventions may offer a promising solution.
*The strongest evidence to date for a nutritional solution to re­duce PTB exists for omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggests that women with low levels of omega-3 in early pregnancy may benefit from supplementation.
*Recent findings suggest that determining an individual wom­an&#39;s polyunsaturated fatty acid status in early pregnancy may be a precise way to inform recommendations to reduce her risk of PTB.
Worldwide, around 15 million preterm babies are born annu­ally, and despite intensive research, the specific mechanisms triggering preterm birth (PTB) remain unclear. Cost-effective primary prevention strategies to reduce PTB are required, and nutritional interventions offer a promising alternative. Nutri­ents contribute to a variety of mechanisms that are potentially important to preterm delivery, such as infection, inflam­mation, oxidative stress, and muscle contractility. Several ob­servational studies have explored the association between dietary nutrients and/or dietary patterns and PTB, often with contrasting results. Randomized trial evidence on the effects of supplementation with zinc, multiple micronutrients (iron and folic acid), and vitamin D is promising; however, results are inconsistent, and many studies are not adequately pow­ered for outcomes of PTB. Large-scale clinical trials with PTB as the primary outcome are needed before any firm conclu­sions can be drawn for these nutrients. 

The strongest evi­dence to date for a nutritional solution exists for omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), key nutri­ents in fish. In 2018, a Cochrane Review (including 70 studies) showed that prenatal supplementation with omega-3 LCPU­FAs reduced the risk of PTB and early PTB (EPTB) compared with no omega-3 supplementation. However, the largest tri­al of omega-3 supplementation in pregnancy, the Omega-3 to Reduce the Incidence of Prematurity (ORIP) trial (n = 5,544), showed no reduction in EPTB and a reduction in PTB only in a prespecified analysis of singleton pregnancies. 
Ex­ploratory analyses from the ORIP trial found that women with low baseline total omega-3 status were at higher risk of EPTB, and that this risk was substantially reduced with omega-3 supplementation. In contrast, women with replete or high baseline total omega-3 status were already at low risk of EPTB and additional omega-3 supplementation increased the risk of EPTB compared to control. These findings suggest that determining an individual woman&#39;s PUFA status may be the most precise way to inform recommendations to reduce her risk of PTB.
