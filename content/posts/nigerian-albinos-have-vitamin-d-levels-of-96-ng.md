BACKGROUND:

Several studies have suggested that the lower vitamin D levels in blacks is attributable to the effect of increased pigmentation in blocking cutaneous ultraviolet (UV)-mediated production of vitamin D. Albinos are devoid of melanin and should invariably have higher vitamin D levels when compared with their pigmented counterparts. However, strict photoprotection required in their medical management has been shown to reduce UV-dependent vitamin D production. Associations between low vitamin D and several diseases suggest that the pattern of vitamin D in the black African albino be investigated.

OBJECTIVE:

To compare the vitamin D levels between albinos and normal pigmented controls in Anambra State, Nigeria, and thus highlight the impact of skin pigmentation and sun protection practices on vitamin D levels.

METHODOLOGY:

This was a cross-sectional study of a consecutive series of albinos from the Albino Foundation, Anambra State. The vitamin D levels of 61 albinos and 58 matched pigmented controls were analyzed. The sun exposures of the participants were calculated using validated sun exposure questionnaires.

RESULTS:

The albinos had significantly higher vitamin D levels (median 95.9 <span>[50.1-177.4]</span> ng/ml) than the controls (78.2 <span>[12.1-250]</span> ng/ml). None of the albinos had low vitamin D levels. None of the sun protection practices had significant effects on vitamin D levels.

CONCLUSION:

This study contests the claim that black Africans including albinos have low vitamin D levels. Albinos living in South East Nigeria have significantly higher vitamin D levels than their pigmented counterparts.
