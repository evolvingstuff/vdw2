Aim

We previously reported a protective effect of maternal omega-3 fatty acid supplements on the development of immunoglobulin E (IgE) associated disease in infancy. This study assessed omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in maternal milk in relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation and the development of allergic disease in their infants.

Methods

This study randomised 95 pregnant women at risk of having an allergic infant, to daily supplements of 2.6g omega-3 LCPUFA or a placebo of 2.7g soy bean oil from gestational week 25 until three months of lactation. Breast milk samples were collected as colostrum, at one and three months. Milk fatty acids were related to allergic outcome in the infants at 24 months.

Results

Omega-3 milk fatty acids were higher in women who received omega-3 supplements than the placebo group (p<0.01). Higher proportions of milk eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and a lower arachidonic/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio were associated with an absence of IgE associated disease in the infants.  **None of the children developed IgE associated atopic eczema**  below a level of 0.83mol% eicosapentaenoic acid in colostrum.

Conclusion

High omega-3 LCPUFA milk levels in mothers who received omega-3 LCPUFA supplements were related to fewer allergies in their children.
