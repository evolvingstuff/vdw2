**Vitamin D (clipped from PDF)** _

During the first wave of Covid-19, low Vitamin D levels have been found in the vulnerable aging population in Spain, Italy and Switzerland which pointed towards the potential of vitamin D in prevention of COVID-19 infection and mortality (Ilie et al., 2020). Vitamin D deficiency has indeed been found to contribute to ARDS and a narrative review on vitamin D shows accumulation of evidence that vitamin D supplementation could reduce risk of COVID-19 infections and deaths (Grant et al., 2020). Vitamin D is known to promote innate immune response against viral infection and a role for TLRs has been proposed in explaining the underlying mechanism. Martinez-Moreno et al showed that innate immune response against the dengue virus (DENV) infection, a public health problem worldwide, can be improved by vitamin D supplementation.

 **Their study showed that an oral supplement of 4000 IU/day of vitamin D3 significantly decreased TLR9 protein levels**  and the mRNA abundance ofTLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 in human. The lower dose of, 1000 IU/day of vitamin D only decreased the TLR9 protein level in human monocte-derived DCs infected with DENV. The finding is especially interesting because TLR9 activation, through mtDNA, contributes to DENV-induced immune activation (Martinez Moreno et al., 2020). A study performed in 2010 also showed that intracellular TLRs are differentially regulated by vitamin D3, with TLR9 being down-regulated by vitamin D3 exposure whereas TLR3 was unaffected (Dickie et al., 2010). The study by Dickie et al showed that vitamin D3 decreased TLR9 expression in monocytes and had a downstream functional effect as these cells subsequently secreted less IL-6 in response to TLR9 challenge.
