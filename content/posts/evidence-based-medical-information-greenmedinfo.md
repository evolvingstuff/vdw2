"GreenMedInfo.com began 3 years ago with a vision to provide the public free and convenient access to scientific evidence supporting natural healing methods. Our project has grown into the worlds largest free and entirely evidence-based natural medical database with over 15,000 articles, and growing daily. We are also unique in the sense that we are an entirely solar-powered database (no green-washing), have no advertisements, and have a volunteer staff which receive no compensation for their work."
