 **Magnesium: Overview of Benefits, Deficiency, Dosage, and Interactions** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Health Benefits of Magnesium</span>** 

Magnesium is involved in  **hundreds of biochemical reactions**  in the body and is essential for  **bone, muscle, nerve, and heart health** . Getting enough magnesium provides a wide range of benefits, including:

*  **Bone Health:**  Magnesium helps regulate calcium and vitamin D, playing a critical role in bone formation. Adequate magnesium intake is linked to better bone density and a lower risk of osteoporosis​

*  **Heart Health:**  Sufficient magnesium supports normal blood pressure and heart rhythm. In fact, diets rich in magnesium may  **reduce the risk of high blood pressure**  – the FDA now allows a qualified health claim acknowledging this link (though evidence is not conclusive)​.

   * Magnesium is also used to treat certain heart arrhythmias (like the dangerous rhythm torsades de pointes) and may help prevent complications like stroke​

*  **Metabolic Health:**  Higher magnesium intake is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Obtaining ample magnesium (particularly from food sources) can help reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in middle-aged adults​

*  **Women's Health:**  Magnesium can alleviate  **premenstrual syndrome (PMS)**  symptoms and has been used in pregnancy to manage  **pre-eclampsia/eclampsia**  (dangerously high blood pressure in pregnancy)​.

Ensuring adequate magnesium may also benefit menopausal women; for example, magnesium supplements have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors​

*  **Digestive Health:**  Certain magnesium compounds serve as  **antacids and laxatives** . Magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) can neutralize stomach acid to relieve heartburn, and magnesium’s osmotic effect in the gut makes it an effective remedy for constipation​

*  **Mental and Nervous System Support:**  Magnesium plays a key role in brain and nervous system function. Low magnesium is associated with mood disorders like  **anxiety and depression** , and increasing magnesium can help reduce stress and improve mood in deficient individuals​.

   * It also has a calming effect on the nervous system, often improving  **sleep quality**  (magnesium can help with insomnia)​.

In clinical settings, magnesium (often given intravenously) has shown effectiveness in reducing  **migraines and headaches** ​

, and it may even aid in relieving symptoms of  **restless leg syndrome**  and muscle cramps by relaxing muscles​

   * (Note: Many of magnesium’s benefits overlap with those of vitamin D. A VitaminDWiki analysis points out that the same key benefits attributed to magnesium – such as improved bone strength, blood pressure control, and reduced risk of diabetes – are also observed with adequate vitamin D, highlighting their interrelated roles​

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Symptoms of Magnesium Deficiency</span>** 

Magnesium deficiency is  **common**  – it’s estimated that a majority of people do not meet the minimum daily magnesium requirements​.

A lack of magnesium can produce a wide range of symptoms, since this mineral affects nearly every system in the body.  **Common signs of magnesium deficiency include:** 

*  **Muscle problems:**  muscle cramps, spasms or twitches, and general muscle aches​

*  **Fatigue and sleep disturbances:**  low energy, weakness, and  **insomnia**  (trouble sleeping) are frequently reported when magnesium is low​

*  **Mood and neurological issues:**  irritability,  **anxiety** , and  **depression**  can arise or worsen with magnesium deficiency, sometimes accompanied by confusion or poor memory​.

   * In severe cases, nerve-related symptoms like numbness, tingling, or even  **seizures**  may occur​

*  **Heart and circulatory symptoms:**   **high blood pressure** , heart palpitations, or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) can be linked to low magnesium​.

   * Magnesium deficiency is also known to cause  **low potassium levels**  (since magnesium is needed to maintain potassium balance), which can further lead to heart rhythm issues​

*  **Bone and metabolic issues:**  chronically low magnesium may contribute to  **osteoporosis**  (weakened bones) over time and is associated with an increased risk of  **type 2 diabetes** ​

Because these symptoms are broad and can overlap with other conditions, magnesium deficiency is often overlooked. Notably, many symptoms of vitamin D deficiency are similar to those of magnesium deficiency, and this is no coincidence – the two nutrients depend on each other (more on that in  **Interactions**  below)​.

If someone has persistently low vitamin D levels or symptoms despite supplementation, an underlying magnesium shortage might be a contributing factor​

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Recommended Dosage and Intake</span>** 

 **Daily Requirements:**  For adults, health guidelines generally recommend a magnesium intake on the order of a few hundred milligrams per day (around  **300–420 mg of elemental magnesium**  for most adults, depending on sex and life stage). This roughly corresponds to the official RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) values, though some experts believe the RDA is set too low​.

In practice, many people do not reach even the minimum recommended intake through diet alone​.

For instance, leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are rich in magnesium, yet modern diets high in processed foods tend to be magnesium-poor. Historical data suggests that a century ago people commonly consumed about  **500 mg of magnesium per day** , whereas today the average is closer to  **200 mg** , reflecting decreased magnesium in our food supply​.

Because of this gap, some nutrition experts advise aiming for  **150% of the current RDA**  for a period of time to “replenish” the body’s magnesium stores, then continuing with a maintenance dose thereafter​.

In practical terms, this means many adults may benefit from about  **400–600 mg of magnesium daily**  (from all sources combined) to ensure optimal levels​

 **Supplementation Guidelines:**  When diet isn’t providing enough, magnesium supplements are used to fill the gap. A typical supplemental dose ranges from  **100 mg up to ~400 mg per day**  of elemental magnesium (note: “elemental” magnesium refers to the actual magnesium content, excluding the weight of whatever compound it’s bound to)​.

The exact amount can be adjusted based on individual needs and tolerances – for example, someone with a significant deficiency might take the higher end (300–400 mg) in supplements, whereas someone getting moderate magnesium from food might take a smaller dose around 100–200 mg.  **It’s often recommended to split the daily magnesium dose into two smaller doses (e.g. morning and evening)**  rather than one large dose​.

Splitting doses improves absorption and helps avoid gastrointestinal side effects. Magnesium in large amounts has a natural laxative effect; many people find that taking more than about  **300–400 mg at once**  can cause loose stools or diarrhea​.

By dividing the dose (for instance, 200 mg twice a day), the intestines can absorb more effectively and the risk of a sudden laxative effect is reduced​

 **Upper Limits and Safety:**  Magnesium from food is not known to cause harm, but with supplements there is a caution not to overdo it. The  **tolerable upper intake level (UL)**  for supplemental magnesium is set at  **350 mg per day**  for adults​.

This UL only applies to  **magnesium from supplements or medications** , not magnesium naturally present in foods​.

The 350 mg guideline is mainly to prevent diarrhea and mild adverse effects in the general population. In practice, many individuals can safely take more than 350 mg/day in supplements if needed for deficiency,  **provided it’s done gradually and under guidance** , but exceeding the UL isn’t advisable unless there's a clear medical reason. It’s important to listen to one’s body – the appearance of diarrhea is a sign to reduce the dose. People with normal kidney function readily excrete excess magnesium, so toxicity is rare; however, those with kidney disease must be much more careful (see  **Additional Details – Safety** ).

 **Choosing a Magnesium Form:**  The form of magnesium supplement can make a big difference in effectiveness and tolerance (see  **Additional Details – Supplement Forms**  for more on this). For example, magnesium oxide pills contain a lot of magnesium by weight but are  **poorly absorbed**  – studies and consensus indicate magnesium oxide has very low bioavailability (not much better than a placebo)​.

In contrast, organic forms like magnesium citrate or magnesium chloride are  **much better absorbed**  by the body​.

* Magnesium citrate is a popular choice for oral supplements; it’s fairly well absorbed, though it can cause looser stools in some people (more so than other forms)​.

* Magnesium chloride is another excellent form – it’s available in liquids or flakes and not only absorbs well orally, but can also be used  **topically**  (applied on the skin) to help with muscle soreness​.

When choosing a supplement, it’s also recommended to  **avoid products that combine calcium and magnesium**  in one pill​.

Many people already get plenty of calcium, and taking high-dose calcium together with magnesium can reduce magnesium’s effectiveness or absorption; moreover, an excessive calcium intake relative to magnesium can be counterproductive (as explained below)​.

For most adults focusing on magnesium, a standalone magnesium supplement (without added calcium) is preferable​

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Interactions with Vitamin D and Other Nutrients</span>** 

One of the most important interactions of magnesium is with  **vitamin D** . Magnesium and vitamin D work  **hand-in-hand** , and each depends on the other to maximize its benefits:

*  **Magnesium activates vitamin D:**  Magnesium is a required co-factor in the enzymatic reactions that convert vitamin D into its active form (calcitriol). There are multiple steps in the liver and kidneys to metabolize vitamin D, and magnesium is needed at  **no fewer than 8 steps in that process** ​.

If magnesium levels are low, vitamin D may not be properly activated to do its job in the body. In effect, a magnesium deficiency can induce a state of “vitamin D resistance,” where even if you have adequate vitamin D intake, it isn’t fully effective​.

This is why some people who take high doses of vitamin D but feel no improvement might actually be lacking magnesium. Ensuring sufficient magnesium can “unlock” vitamin D’s benefits.

*  **Vitamin D consumes magnesium:**  The relationship is a two-way street – while magnesium is needed for vitamin D activity, raising vitamin D levels also  **uses up magnesium** . There are at least two ways this happens. First, vitamin D increases calcium absorption and bone formation; when vitamin D helps deposit calcium into bones, magnesium is drawn in as well because magnesium is an integral component of bone (bones contain a magnesium reserve)​.

Second, all the enzymatic reactions mentioned above require magnesium as a co-factor, so when you take vitamin D, your body will consume magnesium to process it​.

People who start vitamin D supplements sometimes experience muscle cramps or other magnesium-deficiency symptoms – this can be because the sudden increase in vitamin D activity is depleting their borderline magnesium stores.  **In practice, taking vitamin D increases your magnesium requirement** , so it’s wise to supplement magnesium alongside vitamin D​

*  **Synergy and balance:**  Magnesium and vitamin D  **enhance each other’s effectiveness**  when present together​.

Many experts advise that to  **get the full benefit of vitamin D, you must also ensure adequate magnesium** , and vice versa​.

Studies have shown that correcting a magnesium deficiency can raise vitamin D levels in the blood (because the vitamin D is better metabolized), and similarly, having enough vitamin D can improve magnesium’s functions in the body. In short,  **magnesium and vitamin D are synergistic**  nutrients​.

This synergy is evident in their overlapping health effects – for example, magnesium and vitamin D both support bone health, immune function, and cardiovascular health, and deficiency in either is linked to similar issues. It’s even been observed that the vast majority of people are deficient in both simultaneously​.

For these reasons, when supplementing vitamin D, it’s often recommended to add magnesium (and other cofactors like vitamin K2) to avoid any bottleneck in the benefits.

Magnesium also interacts with  **other minerals**  and electrolytes, notably  **calcium**  and  **potassium** . The ratio of calcium to magnesium in the diet is important. Traditionally, a 2:1 calcium-to-magnesium ratio is cited for bone health, but in modern diets the ratio is often much higher (meaning a lot of calcium and too little magnesium).  **High calcium with low magnesium can lead to problems** : excess calcium can deposit where it shouldn’t (like in arteries or kidneys) and can trigger muscle tension, while magnesium is needed to relax muscles and balance calcium’s effects. An analysis on VitaminDWiki points out that populations or individuals with a  **very high Ca:Mg ratio have more heart disease** , suggesting that too much calcium without enough magnesium stresses the cardiovascular system​.

In practical terms, this means if you are supplementing calcium or have a calcium-rich diet, it’s crucial to have sufficient magnesium to keep them in balance. This also explains the earlier point to avoid combined Ca-Mg supplement pills – you don’t want to tip the scales toward calcium when magnesium is the one most people lack​.

Instead, prioritize magnesium (unless a healthcare provider has advised you that you specifically need more calcium). Magnesium helps direct calcium to where it’s needed (bones and teeth) and prevents it from causing calcifications in soft tissues.

Magnesium works closely with  **potassium**  as well. Both magnesium and potassium are electrolytes that maintain normal heart rhythm and muscle function. When magnesium is low, it’s common to see low potassium levels too, because magnesium is required for potassium to enter cells and stay in balance. For example, one sign of magnesium deficiency is a secondary  **potassium deficiency** , which can manifest as muscle weakness, cramps, and abnormal heart rhythms​.

If someone has low potassium that isn’t corrected by taking potassium, it’s often because magnesium is also low. Replenishing magnesium helps stabilize potassium levels, benefiting muscle and heart function​

Finally, certain  **medications and lifestyle factors**  interact with magnesium status. Diuretics (water pills), some chemotherapy drugs, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs used for acid reflux) are known to  **deplete magnesium**  over time​.

Alcohol abuse and high caffeine intake can also increase magnesium loss. People on such medications or with these risk factors should be vigilant about magnesium intake and may require supplementation. Conversely, magnesium can interact with a few medications by affecting their absorption – for instance, magnesium supplements can interfere with certain antibiotics or thyroid medications if taken at the same time, by binding to them in the gut. It’s generally recommended to  **space magnesium supplements a couple of hours apart from medications**  that have known interactions (one should consult a pharmacist or doctor for specific guidance). Overall, maintaining magnesium balance is a matter of managing both diet and these interactions so that magnesium isn’t unintentionally drained from your body.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Additional Considerations and Tips</span>** 

*  **Dietary Sources and Declining Magnesium in Foods:**  Magnesium is naturally present in many foods. Good dietary sources include dark leafy greens (such as spinach and kale), nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds), legumes, whole grains, and certain fruits like bananas and avocados. However, modern farming and food processing have significantly  **reduced the magnesium content of foods**  compared to a century ago​.

Refining grains removes magnesium-rich parts of the grain, and many soils today are less mineral-rich. This contributes to the high prevalence of magnesium deficiency. Historical estimates cited on VitaminDWiki note that around  **1900, the average dietary magnesium intake was ~500 mg/day** , but by the 1990s it had plummeted to ~200 mg/day​.

Additionally, the way we treat our water can remove magnesium – for example, softening water or using reverse osmosis filtration  **eliminates magnesium from drinking water**  (along with other minerals)​.

If your diet is low in produce and high in processed foods, or if you drink only distilled/RO water, you may be getting very little magnesium from these sources. Increasing magnesium-rich whole foods and considering mineral drops for filtered water are ways to improve dietary magnesium intake.

*  **Supplement Forms and Absorption:**  Magnesium supplements come in a variety of  **forms** , and choosing the right form can impact how well it works for you. Some common forms include:

   *  **Magnesium citrate:**  A popular form for supplementation; it is relatively well-absorbed and often used to address constipation as well (due to a mild laxative effect). It usually comes in capsules or powder.

   *  **Magnesium chloride:**  Known for its high bioavailability, magnesium chloride can be taken in liquid form or as magnesium oil applied to the skin. It tends to have a lower laxative effect for a given amount of elemental magnesium, making it gentler on the gut​.

      * Magnesium chloride is also the form found in  **magnesium flakes**  for foot soaks or baths, used to soothe muscles.)

   *  **Magnesium oxide:**  A very common, inexpensive form found in many basic supplements, but  **not well absorbed** . Magnesium oxide provides a lot of magnesium by weight, but the body can only uptake a small fraction of it, so it may act mostly as a laxative and is considered one of the least effective choices for raising magnesium levels​

   *  **Other forms:**  There are many other magnesium compounds available, such as magnesium glycinate (magnesium bound to the amino acid glycine), magnesium malate, magnesium taurate, and magnesium threonate. These were not detailed on the VitaminDWiki page, but in general these forms are designed to improve absorption or target specific issues (for example, magnesium glycinate is known for being easy on the stomach and helpful for anxiety/sleep, while magnesium threonate has been studied for cognitive benefits). All forms ultimately provide magnesium, but if one form causes GI upset, another form might be better tolerated. It may be worth experimenting or consulting nutrition resources to find the form that suits your needs.In addition to oral supplements,  **transdermal magnesium**  is an option. This includes products like  **magnesium oil or gel**  (often magnesium chloride) that you rub on the skin, or Epsom salt baths ( **magnesium sulfate**  in bath water). Transdermal absorption bypasses the digestive system, so it can be useful for people who get diarrhea from oral supplements. Some individuals report good results for muscle relaxation and cramps with magnesium baths or oil. While transdermal absorption rates can vary, these methods are generally safe to try alongside dietary intake. Another novel form mentioned is  **“angstrom” or ionic magnesium** , which refers to very small magnesium particles in a liquid suspension that can be taken sublingually (under the tongue)​.

   * This form is claimed to be absorbed directly into cells with minimal laxative effect, though it tends to be more expensive.

 **Safety and Precautions:**  Magnesium is  **considered safe for most people** , as the kidneys will excrete excess magnesium efficiently in those with normal renal function. There is essentially no risk of getting too much magnesium from food alone. Even with supplements, magnesium toxicity (hypermagnesemia) is rare and typically only occurs if the  **kidneys are not working properly**  (or in extreme overdose situations). That said, there are a few precautions to note. Individuals with  **severely impaired kidney function**  (e.g. end-stage kidney disease on dialysis) should  **not take magnesium supplements unless under medical supervision** ​.

When the kidneys can’t clear magnesium, it can accumulate and cause serious issues (such as slowed heart rate or muscle weakness). Likewise, people with  **Myasthenia Gravis**  (a neuromuscular disorder) are usually advised to avoid extra magnesium, since it can worsen muscle weakness in that condition​.

Magnesium can also slow the heart rate, so if someone has a medical condition characterized by an abnormally slow heart rate or an AV block, high-dose magnesium should be used cautiously​.

Apart from these specific contraindications, the main side effect to watch for is the aforementioned diarrhea or loose stools at higher doses. If you experience this, simply reduce the dosage or switch forms. Signs of  **magnesium overdose**  (which are very uncommon from oral intake) might include lethargy, confusion, extremely low blood pressure, or irregular heartbeat – these would require urgent medical attention. Again, this is exceedingly rare outside of people with kidney failure. Overall, magnesium supplements have an excellent safety profile when used responsibly.

*  **Testing Magnesium Levels:**  Evaluating magnesium status isn’t as straightforward as testing something like blood sugar. Most of the body’s magnesium is stored in  **bones and inside cells** , not in the blood serum. A standard  **serum magnesium test**  (part of many blood panels) can confirm severe deficiency, but it may appear normal even if your tissues are low on magnesium. For a more sensitive measure, some practitioners order a  **RBC magnesium test** , which checks the magnesium content of red blood cells as a proxy for intracellular magnesium​.

There are also magnesium loading tests and ionized magnesium tests, but these are less common. If you suspect magnesium deficiency and your serum levels are “normal,” it might be worth discussing further testing or simply doing a trial of magnesium supplementation (with medical guidance if needed) to see if symptoms improve. Since magnesium is safe and affordable, a practical approach for many is to ensure they meet intake recommendations and monitor how they feel.

 **~~#F00:In summary, magnesium is a vital nutrient** ~~ that supports numerous aspects of health, from strengthening bones to regulating mood and heart rhythm. It works in concert with vitamin D and other nutrients, so maintaining a good balance is key. Given the prevalence of magnesium deficiency and the potential benefits of correcting it, magnesium deserves attention in anyone’s nutrition and wellness plan. Whether through magnesium-rich foods or quality supplements (and often both), achieving adequate magnesium levels can lead to noticeable improvements in well-being – with better sleep, steadier mood, fewer cramps/headaches, and even improvements in blood pressure or blood sugar control. Magnesium truly is an unsung hero among minerals, and ensuring you get enough can pay dividends for your health

#### Hot Flashes and Magnesium

 **1 [Health Fellow: Magnesium reduced Hot Flashes in Breast Cancer Survivors July 2010](http://www.healthyfellow.com/582/hot-flashes-influenza-and-weight-loss-updates)** 

- - - - clip - - - -

A recent pilot study was presented at this year’s annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The subject matter dealt with hot flashes that up 40% of breast cancer survivors experience. Specifically, researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University examined the applicability of magnesium supplements in this patient population. Over the course of 5 weeks, 29 breast cancer survivors who experienced at least 14 hot flashes per week were given 250 – 500 mg of magnesium oxide daily.  **The majority of the women (56%) found a >50% or greater reduction in their “hot flash score”.** 

The overall conclusion was that  **76% of the female participants reported a >25% decline in hot flash frequency and severity** .

The authors of this preliminary study stated that “Side effects and cost ($0.02/tablet) were minimal”. It’s also reassuring to know that a bigger, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is currently in the works that hope to establish exactly how magnesium diminishes hot flashes.

 **Glasp summary** 

* 22 popular magnesium supplements were lab tested, including brands like Swanson, NOW Foods, GNC, Doctor's Best, and Life Extension.

* Of the 22 products tested, 

   * only 12 met or exceeded their label claims, 

   * 8 failed to meet claims, and 

   * 2 were guilty of deceptive marketing.

* Magnesium supplements come in different forms (glycinate, oxide, malate, citrate, etc.) with varying levels of elemental magnesium and absorption rates—magnesium glycinate is 14.1% elemental magnesium while oxide is 61%.

* Many "magnesium glycinate" products claiming to be fully chelated failed additional water extraction testing, **revealing they were likely just blends of glycine with magnesium oxide/carbonate rather than true chelates** .

* Worst offenders included 

   * Deal Supplement (claimed 750mg, tested 126mg), 

   * Purely Holistic (claimed 200mg, but only 44mg of chelated magnesium), and 

   * ZYY Nutrition (claimed impossible 500mg, delivered only 65mg).

* Top performers included Doctor's Best, NOW Foods, Life Extension, and Jigsaw Health, which all met or exceeded their label claims.

* Several brands (Double Wood, GNC, Innate Vitality, Nature Bell) used deceptive front label marketing by

   *  **listing the compound weight rather than the actual elemental magnesium content.** 

* The presenter recommends magnesium glycinate as a good general form but encourages viewers to research which form best suits their needs.

#### Magnesium acetyl taurate best in rat study - 2019

 **Compounds in Hours: Which Magnesium Compound Works Best?** 

Biological Trace Element Research volume 187, pages128–136 (2019)Timeline (Bioavailability) of Magnesium

\Nazan Uysal, Servet Kizildag, Zeynep Yuce, Guven Guvendi, Sevim Kandis, Basar Koc, Aslı Karakilic, Ulas M. Camsari & Mehmet Ates

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mg-t1.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

Magnesium is an element of great importance functioning because of its association with many cellular physiological functions. The magnesium content of foods is gradually decreasing due to food processing, and magnesium supplementation for healthy living has become increasingly popular. However, data is very limited on the bioavailability of various magnesium preparations. The aim of this study is to investigate the bioavailability of five different magnesium compounds (magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, magnesium acetyl taurate, magnesium citrate, and magnesium malate) in different tissues. Following a single dose of 400 mg/70 kg magnesium administration to Sprague Dawley rats, bioavailability was evaluated by examining time-dependent absorption, tissue penetration, and the effects on the behavior of the animals.

Pharmacokinetically, the area under the curve calculation is highest in the magnesium malate.

The magnesium acetyl taurate was found to have the second-highest area under the curve calculation.  **Magnesium acetyl taurate was rapidly absorbed, able to pass through to the brain easily, had the highest tissue concentration level in the brain, and was found to be associated with decreased anxiety indicators.**  Magnesium malate levels remained high for an extended period of time in the serum. The commonly prescribed dietary supplements magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate had the lowest bioavailability when compared to our control group. More research is needed to investigate the bioavailability of magnesium malate and acetyl taurate compounds and their effects on specific tissues and behavior.

#### Citrate good, Oxide not better than placebo - RCT 2003

[Mg citrate found more bioavailable than other Mg preparations in a randomized, double-blind study](http://www.jle.com/en/revues/mrh/e-docs/mg_citrate_found_more_bioavailable_than_other_mg_preparations_in_a_randomised_doubleblind_study__260858/article.phtml)

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mg-bioavailability-2003.jpg" alt="image" width="800">

Published data on the bioavailability of various Mg preparations is too fragmented and scanty to inform the proper choice of Mg preparation for clinical studies. In this study, the relative bioavailability of three preparations of Mg (amino-acid chelate, citrate, and oxide) was compared at a daily dose of 300 mg of elemental Mg in 46 healthy individuals. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention of 60 days duration. Urine, blood, and saliva samples were taken at baseline, 24 h after the first Mg supplement was taken (acute‘ supplementation), and after 60 days of daily Mg consumption (chronic‘ supplementation). Results showed that supplementation of the organic forms of Mg (citrate and amino-acid chelate) showed greater absorption (P ± 0.033) at 60 days than MgO, as assessed by the 24-h urinary Mg excretion. Mg citrate led to the greatest mean serum Mg concentration compared with other treatments following both acute (P ± 0.026) and chronic (P ± 0.006) supplementation. Furthermore, although mean erythrocyte Mg concentration showed no differences among groups, chronic Mg citrate supplementation resulted in the greatest (P ± 0.027) mean salivary Mg concentration compared with all other treatments.  **Mg oxide supplementation resulted in no differences compared to placebo** . We conclude that daily supplementation with Mg citrate shows superior bioavailability after 60 days of treatment when compared with other treatments studied.

"Refining and cooking may diminish the Mg content very substantially (18).

The refining of whole wheat to patent flour results in a loss of 80-96% (18, 66) of the Mg content, and the polishing of rice may remove > 80%.

The refining of sugar removes almost all the Mg (18,67) and

boiling vegetables may cause a Mg loss of > 50% (18).

There are observations that the Mg intake of humans has declined very sharply during the past few decades (68).

This may be due to the refining and preparing of food but also to the use of fertilizers with no Mg (53)."

#### Magnesium levels fall with chemos, PPI - May 2023

Medications that may decrease magnesium levels include certain chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin (Doxil), nedaplatin (Aqupla), and others) (Komoda, J Gen Fam Med 2023), diuretics, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce stomach acid.

The FDA in 2011 specifically warned that PPIs may cause low serum magnesium levels if taken for prolonged periods of time (in most cases, longer than one year). Examples of PPIs are Nexium, Dexilant, Prilosec, Prevacid, Protonix, AcipHex, Vimovo, and Zegerid. Treatment of hypomagnesemia generally requires magnesium supplements. However, in approximately one-quarter of the cases reviewed, magnesium supplementation alone did not improve low serum magnesium levels, and the PPI had to be discontinued.

#### Reasons for Magnesium Deficiency include

* Use of chemical fertilizers- which lack Magnesium

* Refined wheat/rice - remove 80+%

* Refined sugar - vs brown sugar, which has 30 mg of Magnesium per 100 gram

* Boiling vegetables - might lose 50%

* Gut absorption problems|2012].

* Magnesium is removed from most city and bottled waters (as well as water softeners and reverse osmosis)

* Calcium supplements - a probable Magnesium antagonist

* Fluoridation might <a href="/posts/bind-magnesium-in-the-body" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1985">bind Magnesium in the body</a>

#### Reasons for Magnesium Deficiency - from Metabolics.com

[Reasons for Magnesium Deficiency - Metabolics.com](http://www.metabolics.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-magnesium-and-magnesium-supplements/)

* The use of herbicides and pesticides that kill off worms and bacteria in the soil.

> This is taken up by plants in preference to Calcium and Magnesium.

* Soil erosion as Magnesium is leached out by heavy rain.

* Acid rain (as occurs in air pollution) contains Nitric Acid.

> In the soil, Nitric Acid reacts with Calcium and Magnesium to neutralize excess nitric acid.

> Eventually, Calcium and Magnesium become depleted, and the nitric acid reacts with Aluminium oxide in the soil.

> A reactive Aluminium builds up, replacing Calcium and Magnesium in the plant.

> Calcium is needed for cell wall strength, and Magnesium for chlorophyll for photosynthesis. So plants may grow taller and faster but are weak and lack chlorophyll.

* Food processing decreases Magnesium.

> It is lost in grains during the milling and making of white flour. It is also lost in vegetables when they are boiled.

* Fluoride in water and toothpaste binds to Magnesium, making it unavailable to the body.

> Fluoride is insoluble and replaces Magnesium in bone and cartilage.

* Stress. Increased stress results in decreased stomach acid and decreased hydrochloric acid in the stomach resulting in decreased absorption of Magnesium.

> Commonly consumed antacids neutralize Hydrochloric acid, decreasing Magnesium absorption.

* Magnesium absorption is altered by an unhealthy intestine, for example;

> IBS, leaky gut, gluten, and casein sensitivities, funguses & parasites, vitamin D deficiency, and the formation of Magnesium soaps in the stools as Magnesium binds to unabsorbed fats.

* Some foods can block the absorption of Magnesium.

> High protein diets can decrease Magnesium absorption.

> Tannins in tea bind and remove minerals, including Magnesium.

> Oxalic acid in rhubarb, spinach, and chard and phytic acid in cereals and soy also block the absorption of Magnesium.

* Junk foods, particularly sugary foods, all use up extra Magnesium.

* Saturated and trans fats alter cell wall integrity, making it more rigid, which affects receptor site function and prevents nutrients from getting into or out of the cell.

* Drugs - some drugs eliminate Magnesium. Antacids, antibiotics, and diuretics all cause Magnesium depletion.

> Large consumption of caffeine and alcohol causes depletion with their diuretic effect.

* Hypokalaemia (low potassium levels) can increase urinary Magnesium loss.

* Body size - the larger the body, the larger the Magnesium pool, then the lower the absorption from any source.

### How much Magnesium

#### What's The RIGHT Magnesium Dosage For Optimal Health?

[Kerri Knox at Easy Immune System Health](http://www.easy-immune-health.com/magnesium-dosage.html)

* Type as well as the amount - in the forms of tablet, <span style="color:#00F;">gel, bath flakes, etc., as well as time release</span>

* Mentions [Angstrom Magnesium](http://www.easy-immune-health.com/angstrom-magnesium-and-fibromyalgia.html) - which apparently does not cause bowel problems and can be taken sublingually

   * has an extreme taste - probably need to mask it in fruit juice. Also known as ionic magnesium

   * [CLICK HERE](http://www.google.com/search?q=angstrom%20magnesium&tbm=shop&hl=en&aq=f) for suppliers of Angstrom Magnesium via Google Shopping

* Mentions an expensive ($39 for 8 ounces)[transdermal Magnesium Gel](http://www.magneticclay.com/store/magnesium-gel-ancient-minerals-8.aspx) which can be applied to the skin

* See also <a href="/posts/her-page-on-magnesium-on-vitamindwiki" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 612">her page on Magnesium on VitaminDWiki</a>

* Dr. Dean  states “ Most magnesium experts agree that the current RDA is inadequate to prevent magnesium deficiency, but most men and women do not even get this minimal amount of magnesium.“

---

#### The upper limit is for supplements onlyand is less than the RDA

from: http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&dbid=75

In 1997, the National Academy of Sciences set a tolerable upper limit (UL) on intake of magnesium at** 350 milligrams per day **for individuals 9 years and older.

This limit was restricted, however, to** magnesium obtained from dietary supplements **, and no upper limit was set on the intake of magnesium from food sources.

#### Magnesium Requirements

There are many factors that will vary our magnesium needs.

* The more stress you are under, the more magnesium you need.

* The more you use your brain in thinking, the more magnesium you use.

* The more active you are, the more magnesium you use up.

* The larger you are, the more magnesium you require.

* Prescription drugs (and illegal drugs) and** alcohol require extra magnesium *** Your bones are a 2:1 calcium/magnesium ratio, while your brain is more like 2:1 Mg: Ca

clipped - - -** We also believe that 70-90% of the population is deficient in magnesium and has a lot of catching up to do (could take more than a year).  **** Once you have caught up, you can go to a maintenance level. **** We recommend 150% of the RDA because we believe that *** Most people are deficient

* That the RDA is on the low side

* Most of the magnesium is going to calcium absorption and neutralizing an acidic diet

* Consuming only the RDA levels will not leave enough to combat insomnia, heart palpitations, muscle, aches and other symptoms

### Magnesium and Vitamin D

#### Magnesium and Vitamin D - similarities and differences

 **Similar** 

* Widespread deficiency of both is due primarily to a single cause during the past century.

* Little toxicity

* One needs the other to work properly: being deficient in one can cause problems with the other.

* Increasing either decreases the rates of many of the same diseases

* Both have strong interactions with Calcium and Vitamin K2

 **Different** 

* Magnesium has no long-term storage in the body (not in fat) like Vitamin D does

* Very noticeable reaction if take too much Magnesium but not vitamin D

* The body can only absorb so much Magnesium per 6 hours – no limit with vitamin D

* There are a variety of magnesium compounds – with different bioavailability and reactions

* Increasing vitamin D without magnesium can be problematic but not vice versa

#### Vitamin D and Magnesium are similar [Life Extension Mag - Dec 2016](/posts/magnesium-and-vitamin-d)

 **Both Vitamin D and Magnesium** 

Extremely low-cost supplement

Recent steep decline

Some of the decline is due to changes in food production

skim milk, fertilizer, indoor animals, water filtration, roundup

A large % of the world's human population is now deficient

Forms: Oral, topical, Injection,

Various Cancers

Various diseases increase as the nutrient decreases

Bones, Cardio, Diabetes, Obesity, hardened arteries

Provides both prevention and treatment

Cofactors

Synergistic

Calcium should be decreased

Tests are expensive and can be misleading

Limited by the poor kidney, poor gut

Seniors have less

Needed by most parts of the body

Influences many genes/enzymes

Many proofs and positive meta-analyses

Doctors are not aware, but vets are aware

Many forms and types are available

Does size vary with weight

Drugs reduce Magnesium and Vitamin D

Thousands of Binding sites for both

 **Just Vitamin D** 

Can start quickly - Loading dose (Adding some Magnesium should help)

Skin color is important

Air conditioning and staying indoors reduces vitamin D

Decreased by antibiotics

 **Just Magnesium** 

Need to start slowly

Bioavailability varies widely between types of Magnesium

Very noticeable reaction if take too much Magnesium,

| Magnesium Glycinate | A chelated form of magnesium that tends to provide effective levels of absorption and bioavailability. |
| Magnesium oxide | A non-chelated form of magnesium bound to an organic acid or fatty acid. Contains up to 60% elemental magnesium and has stool-softening properties. |
| Magnesium chloride/Magnesium lactate | Contains only about 12% elemental magnesium but tends to have better absorption capabilities than magnesium oxide which has 5 times the magnesium. |
| Magnesium sulfate/Magnesium hydroxide | These are typically used as laxatives. Milk of Magnesia is an example of this type of magnesium. Since magnesium hydroxide can have up to 42% elemental magnesium, caution is required here not to take too much. |
| Magnesium carbonate | This form of magnesium has antacid properties and can contain from 29 to 45% elemental magnesium. |
| Magnesium taurate | This contains a combination of magnesium and taurine (an amino acid) that together may provide a calming effect on the body and mind. |

#### My notes of the book Magnesium Miracle by C. Dean 2007 – need to be confirmed.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Update Aug 2017 - 2nd edition of Magnesium Miracle book - 30% new material. $14</span>** 

 **Paul Mason**  summarized the WHO 2006 conference on Calcium and Magnesium in Drinking Water as:

1) There is a consensus that most of the world is deficient

Agreed that there are only 4 ways of increasing Magnesium and Calcium

2A) Have everyone on earth take pills – which has never been done before,

unlikely on a global level. But practical on an individual level

2B) Advise everyone on Earth to get better food.

Again unlikely globally but practical for individuals

2C) Add Calcium and Magnesium to tap water.

Very wasteful, as 99% of tap water is not used for drinking

Calcium can also build up as the scale

2D) Require bottlers to add optimal calcium and magnesium to bottled products

(hoped that this would be done in 2008, but it looks like no action was taken)

[WHO 2009](http://books.google.com/books?id=dInKO6fSQqMC&pg=PA55&dq=world%20health%20organization%20'bottled%20water"%20calcium%20magnesium&hl=en&ei=L1HYTMi8B4PAsAPr8JWNCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA): mentions water softeners and reverse osmosis systems remove all Magnesium and Calcium. Also, reverse osmosis systems add Sodium.

Pg xvii Magnesium regulates more than 325 enzymes in the body and orchestrates electric current in the nerves (along with Calcium)

Pg xvii  **Dietary Magnesium had been <span style="color:#00F;">500 mg/day</span> in 1900 and barely <span style="color:#00F;">200 mg </span>in 1990** 

Pg xix has 21 diseases associated with Magnesium deficiency – some of which are also associated with Vitamin D deficiency (for example: Asthma, Diabetes, Fatigue, Heart Disease, hypertension, kidney disease, back pain, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, and tooth decay). 68 Symptoms of Magnesium deficiency are listed in the section:  **Who is Deficient** 

 **The Body is Electric** . There is 10,000 X as much Magnesium in the cell as Calcium. And Magnesium limits how much Calcium can get into a cell (which is the reason for many of the diseases associated with Magnesium deficiency – the problem is not having too little Magnesium, but getting too much Calcium into cells), and this is controlled by Mg++-dependent ATP. This is why serum Ca++ is easy to determine (about 50% of that circulating is ionized). And that serum ionized component communicates with the parathyroid glands. Intracellular Ca++ is critical for the transmission of neuromuscular impulses but is immediately transported out of the cell afterward. On the other hand, only 1-2% of total magnesium is circulating, and less than 50% of that is ionized. This has only a very weak correlation with intracellular magnesium, 99% of which is bound, esp. to ADP and ATP. Mg++ is the only active form.

60-65% of Magnesium is in the bones Blood has only 1% of the Magnesium (vs 99% of the Calcium is in bones)

 **Dead Soil**  Potash which has been used for fertilizer since the 1930s, is more easily taken up by plants than magnesium or calcium. There typically is Magnesium in soils that have been used/abused for a long time. It also is leached out by rainwater, especially from acid rains. If soil is determined to be too acidic, lime is typically added, which again reduces the Magnesium.

 **Processed Food Lacks Magnesium**  Refining flour is 80% lost, and Polishing rice is 83% lost. Production of starch from corn 97% lost, Extraction of white sugar from molasses 99% lost

 **Fluoridated Water Banishes Magnesium**  Fluoride binds magnesium, making it insoluble, and it makes bones brittle.

 **Stomach Acid is Essential for Magnesium Absorption,**  A big problem for people such as the elderly who are deficient in stomach acid.

 **Absorption of Dietary Magnesium Is Hindered.**  A healthy body nicely sluffs off any excess magnesium. Our body was not evolved to store magnesium as it had always been readily available in foods. Problems with magnesium absorption include diseased intestines, low parathyroid hormone, amount of calcium, phosphorus, potassium (wonder about vitamin D), sodium, lactose, and iron. If take iron, take hours apart from when take magnesium.

 **Magnesium is blocked by certain foods,**  High protein, spinach, chard, and un-fermented soy, …

 **Drugs cause magnesium deficiency**  diuretics, bronchodilators, birth control pills, insulin, digitalis, insulin, tetracycline, Corticosteroids, Nicotine, cisplatin (chemotherapy)

 **Vitamin and Mineral Interactions with Magnesium**  “Sufficient vitamin D is necessary for the body to utilize magnesium” (wonder how much sufficient is)

 **Heart Attacks**  7 clinical studies have shown that 5-10 grams of intravenous magnesium reduced the risk of death by 55% after an acute heart attack.

 **PMS**  was reduced with 400 mg of Magnesium. Recommend taking 50 mg of B6 to assist in magnesium absorption.

 **Chocolate craving**  “is a sure sign” of magnesium deficiency. Chocolate has the most magnesium of any food.

Magnesium is just as important as calcium to prevent and treat  **osteoporosis.** 

Magnesium keeps calcium dissolved in the blood so it will not form  **<span style="color:#00F;">kidney stones.</span>** 

Magnesium deficiency is common in  **chronic fatigue syndrome**  and  **fibromyalgia sufferers.** 

Magnesium deficiency may be an independent predictor of  **diabetes** 

 **Diabetics**  both need more magnesium and lose more than most people.

Magnesium acts as a natural  **statin** 

Magnesium reduces  **lactic acid** , which causes post-exercise pain

Magnesium is lost during  **exercise** 

Magnesium deficiency may cause  **sudden cardiac death in healthy athletes** 

Magnesium and calcium deficiency may be a cause of  **growing pains in children** 

Magnesium deficiency can produce symptoms of  **anxiety or depression** 

The author takes about 7 pages to describe  **Magnesium tests** . Apparently, very little of the body’s Magnesium is in the blood serum, and it is tightly regulated – except that when under stress, the body adds more Magnesium to the blood. It appears that tests for Magnesium which test the serum, are misleading, and white and red blood cell tests are an OK indication of blood in the cells of the body unless the body is under stress – such as an asthma attack. A better test is an EXATest – which measures the amount of Magnesium in the mouth. The best test is a “blood ionized magnesium test,” which, at the time of the book, was available only to researchers.

#### Notes on what needs to be made into a summary/introduction (May 2022)

Summarize Mg: The body knows how to get rid of too much at one time,

* rare gene problems causing loss of Magnesium

Many forms – vastly different amounts get into the body

important to 20+ health conditions – such as bone

Can also get Mg through the skin: Epson Salt foot bath, MgCl in DMSO

Far less Mg in food in the past 40 years

Many drugs and chemicals also reduce Magnesium in the body

Suspect also that need more Mg as have more Vitamin D

Increase Mg to at least 500, decrease Ca to <500 – perhaps zero?

Magnesium Chloride – pill, liquid, cream

Pico Mg – apparently no side effects 48 of 300 mg for $30

vs. 32 of 300 for $18 Mg Chloride

From Amazon

$.42 per 200 mg elemental Mg as Dr. Dean's Remag

$.08 per 200 mg elemental Mg as magnesium malate

$15 for 120 tabs of 75mg elemental Mg as MgCl2 or $.333 per 200 mg elemental Mg (as MgCl2)

24mg Mg/70 Mg Cl2 = ~25% Mg

$16 for 454 gm (a pound of MgCl2) or $16 for 116 gm elemental Mg++

(200 mg/116 gm) x $16 = $.0276 per 200 mg Mg as MgCl2 + cost of the veggie capsule ($7/100 or 7 cents v $17/1000 or 2 cents)

Mg vs. Fe = Chlorophyll vs. Hemoglobin

Mg/Heart analysis

More people are deficient? many similar recent reasons,

Widespread health, Deficiency not associated with a specific problem

Mag decreased: furt (see chart in Mag page), refined foods,

high-fat diet, salt, less hard water, transdermal

Calcium supplementation, boiling veg, coffee, diuretics,*****************

impaired absorption such as Crohn's disease, unhealthy kidney

diabetes, 30% to 60% of alcoholics, fluoridation?

magnesium absorption decreases and +renal excretion in seniors

Potash is more easily taken up by plants than mag or calcium.

Mg overdose – only if dialysis (Kidney not working)

Mg: Pico, attach PDF, 100% – nothing for a laxative,

just 1/4 teaspoon twice a day – for 14 days

http://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Minerals-Magnesium-Pico-Ionic-ebook/dp/B009V2ZJZ4 $4.00

Pico: The Pico-Ionic form is 50,000 ppm and comes in 8oz. bottles at an average daily dosage of 250mg per 4mls (1 tsp = 5 ml)

http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Ionic-Minerals-Magnesium-250mg/dp/B005PFK3YS/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_1 half price

[Liguid Magnesium from Mother Earth Minerals](http://www.meminerals.com/usage.asp#Conversion%20Ratio) is extremely diluted and should be ignored

only 10 milligrams of Mg per teaspoon.

 **Candida may interfere with the absorption of Magnesium in the gut** 

Comment from the Web March 2015

Dr. Dean indicates that leaky gut syndrome, strongly associated with Candida overgrowth, inhibits magnesium absorption.

#### Extensive Overview of all Health and Magnesium by Examine - July 2024

 **[Mg Examine.com](https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/#examine-database)** 

*  **Sample** "Many observations related to magnesium’s effect on reducing disease risk are likely due to correction of a deficiency. In other words, it may not be the case that supplemental magnesium is beneficial per se; instead, magnesium deficiency may lead to several health problems, many of which may be related to chronic low-grade inflammation.<sup>[36]</sup> There is also the  **possibility of reverse causation**  because many modern diseases (i.e., obesity and diabetes) may lead to a magnesium deficiency.'

Does not appear to mention anything about [Magnesium Depletion Score predicts increased risk of various health problems](/posts/magnesium-depletion-score-predicts-increased-risk-of-various-health-problems) which is a better way than Mg test for estimating Mg in the body

#### Extensive Overview of Magnesium at Pauling Institute - updated Nov 2018

 **[web](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/minerals/magnesium)** 

 **Summary points (without hyperlinks)** 

* Magnesium is an essential mineral and a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes. Magnesium is involved in many physiologic pathways, including energy production, nucleic acid and protein synthesis, ion transport, and cell signaling, and also has structural functions. (More information)

* Severe magnesium deficiency can impede vitamin D and calcium homeostasis. Certain individuals are more susceptible to magnesium deficiency, especially those with gastrointestinal or renal disorders, those suffering from chronic alcoholism, and older people. (More information)

* Inadequate dietary intakes and/or low serum concentrations of magnesium have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Preliminary studies have shown that magnesium improved insulin sensitivity in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Randomized controlled trials have also investigated the role of magnesium supplementation in the prevention of complications following stroke or heart surgery. (More information)

* Magnesium sulfate is used in obstetric care for the prevention of seizures in pregnant women with preeclampsia or eclampsia. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials also support the role of magnesium in preventing brain damage in premature infants. (More information)

* The use of magnesium supplementation is currently being explored in the management of various conditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and pain. (More information)

* About half of the US adult population may have insufficient magnesium intake to support nutritional adequacy. Dietary sources rich in magnesium include green leafy vegetables, unrefined grains, legumes, beans, and nuts. (More information)

* The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for supplemental magnesium is 350 mg/day. Excessive intake of supplemental magnesium can result in adverse effects, especially in individuals with impaired kidney functions. (More information)

* Magnesium plays an important role in the structure and function of the human body. The adult human body contains about 25 grams (g) of magnesium. About 50 to 60% of all the magnesium in the body is found in the skeleton, and the remainder is found in soft tissue, primarily in muscle. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation after potassium. Blood contains less than 1% of total body magnesium. Only the free, ionized form of magnesium (Mg2+) is physiologically active. Protein-bound and chelated magnesium serve to buffer the pool of free, ionized magnesium (1).
