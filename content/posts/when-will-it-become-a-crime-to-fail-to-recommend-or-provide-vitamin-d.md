#### Will the criminals be pet owners, parents, doctors, or hospitals?

 **Doctors are slow to change for many reasons** 

 **Additional reasons to not recommend Vitamin D includes patents and Vitamin D2** 

 **However, benefits of vitamin D have been proven**

#### Doctors are slow to change for many reasons

*  **“It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary is dependent upon his not understanding it”** 

   * [Upton Sinclair](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair%20)

* [Gynecologists](/tags/gynecologists.html) may have the most to lose when patients have enough vitamin D

* [Cancer doctors are a close second](/tags/cancer-doctors-are-a-close-second.html)

* Doctors are wary of yet another vitamin which claims too much (A, B, C, E . . . )

* Doctors cannot charge for vitamin D tests in many countries [such as Canada](/tags/such-as-canada.html) and insurance plans

* Medical professionals are often not aware of [groups which are at high-risk of being vitamin D deficient, nor the causes](/tags/groups-which-are-at-high-risk-of-being-vitamin-d-deficient-nor-the-causes.html)

* Doctors who do not follow "accepted practice" (and more vitamin D is not yet accepted practice) open themselves up to mal-practice law suits.

#### Additional excuses that doctors have to not recommend Vitamin D

* [Experts have been unable to agree on vitamin D levels](/tags/experts-have-been-unable-to-agree-on-vitamin-d-levels.html): 30 ng, 50 ng, or what

> While experts have been unable to agree, the [US govt lowered the vitamin D level to 20 ng](/tags/us-govt-lowered-the-vitamin-d-level-to-20-ng.html) 

* [Many health applications of vitamin D have been patented](/tags/many-health-applications-of-vitamin-d-have-been-patented.html)

> Examples: Reduce weight, reduce chemotherapy needed, reduce falls, reduce scars, improve fertility,

> &nbsp; &nbsp; treat heart disease,  treat endometriosis, treat liver disease,  treat type 1 diabetes, etc. etc.

* Often doctors can only prescribe vitamin D2 

> [D2 has been proven many times to actually decrease blood levels and/or make the health condition worse](/tags/d2-has-been-proven-many-times-to-actually-decrease-blood-levels-andor-make-the-health-condition-worse.html)

* Healthcare systems are typically rewarded for providing treatment, not prevention

#### However, a huge number of vitamin D trials and meta-analysis of trials have proven the great benefits of vitamin D

* [All Meta-analysis items in VitaminDWiki](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=82&amp;sort_mode=created_desc) 38 Meta-analysis as of Jan 2012

> Note: Meta-analysis are analysis of the results of 10 to 30 Random Controlled Trials

> As of Dec 2011 there were [&gt;700 Vitamin D intervention clinical trials](/tags/gt700-vitamin-d-intervention-clinical-trials.html) - more than any other medical intervention.

#### Many quotes on the web, such as

* [Mercola Oct 2010](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lea-yekutiel/blog/2010/10/03/optimizing-your-vitamin-d-cancer-fighter-1)

> It is my impression that it is criminal malpractice not to recommend vitamin D and aggressively monitor a breast cancer patient's vitamin D level to get it between 70 and 100 ng/ml. 

* [March 2010](http://www.drsoram.com/vitamin-d-supplementation-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding-is-found-to-be-vital/)

> Dr. Hollis could not state this strongly enough.  “I think it is medical malpractice for obstetricians not to know what the Vitamin D level of their patients is.”

* [Vitamin D Council](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/news-archive/2009/pregnancy-and-gestational-vitamin-d-deficiency/) 2009

> "As the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently recommended that all pregnant women have a 25(OH)D blood test...

> As the AAP recommendation came from an official medical body, to medical malpractice attorneys it represents evidence of a 'standard of care' for future lawsuits."
