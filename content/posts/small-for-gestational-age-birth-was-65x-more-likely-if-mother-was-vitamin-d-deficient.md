CONTEXT:

Vitamin D deficiency is common in the pregnant women. Nevertheless, the association between maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and the risks of small for gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight (LBW) infants is uncertain.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and the risks of SGA and LBW infants in Chinese population.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a population-based birth cohort study that recruited total 3658 eligible mother-and-singleton-offspring pairs.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay. The rate and relative risk (RR) for SGA and LBW infants were calculated among subjects with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency during pregnancy.

RESULTS:

There was a positive correlation between maternal serum 25(OH)D level and offspring birth weight (r=0.477, P<0.001). Further analysis showed that 4.98% neonates were  **LBW**  infants among subjects with vitamin D deficiency ( **RR: 12.00** ; 95%CI: 4.37, 33.00) and 1.32% among subjects with vitamin D insufficiency (RR: 3.18; 95%CI: 1.07, 9.48). After adjustment for confounders, RR for LBW infants was 12.31 (95%CI: 4.47, 33.89) among subjects with vitamin D deficiency and 3.15 (95%CI: 1.06, 9.39) among subjects with vitamin D insufficiency. Moreover, 16.01% neonates were SGA infants among subjects with vitamin D deficiency (RR: 5.72; 95%CI: 3.80, 8.59) and 5.59% among subjects with vitamin D insufficiency (RR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.27, 3.13). 

After adjustment for confounders, RR for SGA infants was  **6.47**  (95%CI: 4.30, 9.75) among subjects with vitamin D deficiency and 2.01 (95%CI: 1.28, 3.16) among subjects with vitamin D insufficiency.

CONCLUSION: Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy elevates the risks of SGA and LBW infants in Chinese population.
