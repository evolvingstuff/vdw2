RATIONALE: Little is known about vitamin D status and its effect on asthma pathophysiology in children with severe, therapy-resistant asthma (STRA).

OBJECTIVES: Relationships between serum vitamin D, lung function, and pathology were investigated in pediatric STRA.

METHODS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D(3)]</span> was measured in 86 children (mean age, 11.7 yr): 36 with STRA, 26 with moderate asthma (MA), and 24 without asthma (control subjects). Relationships between 25(OH)D(3), the asthma control test (ACT), spirometry, corticosteroid use, and exacerbations were assessed. Twenty-two of 36 children with STRA underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and endobronchial biopsy with assessment of airway inflammation and remodeling.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 25(OH)D(3) levels (median <span>[IQR]</span>) were significantly lower in 

* STRA (28 <span>[22-38]</span> nmol/L) than in 

* MA (42.5 <span>[29-63]</span> nmol/L) and 

* control subjects (56.5 <span>[45-67]</span> nmol/L) (P < 0.001). 

There was a positive relationship between 25(OH)D(3) levels and percent predicted FEV(1) (r = 0.4, P < 0.001) and FVC (r = 0.3, P = 0.002) in all subjects. 25(OH)D(3) levels were positively associated with ACT (r = 0.6, P < 0.001), and inversely associated with exacerbations (r = -0.6, P < 0.001) and inhaled steroid dose (r = -0.39, P = 0.001) in MA and STRA. 

Airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass, but not epithelial shedding or reticular basement membrane thickness, was inversely related to 25(OH)D(3) levels (r = -0.6, P = 0.008). 

There was a positive correlation between ASM mass and bronchodilator reversibility (r = 0.6, P = 0.009) and an inverse correlation between ASM mass and ACT (r = -0.7, P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin D levels in children with STRA were associated with increased ASM mass and worse asthma control and lung function. The link between vitamin D, airway structure, and function suggests vitamin D supplementation may be useful in pediatric STRA.
