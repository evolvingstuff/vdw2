“I don’t think there’s any question that America’s original sin was not having a broadly available test by the time COVID-19 was here,” said Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the founder and director of the Scripps Research facility. “It’s atrocious, egregious, and grotesque. We’re still living with the fallout of not having enough tests. It’s the original sin that has become our daily tragedy.”

 **I doubt their assumptions concerning future pandemics** 

1. Pandemics will occure at the same rate in the future

1. Pandemics will not spread any faster in the future

1. Tests can be developed and deployed far faster in the future

 **The founder of VitaminDWiki believes that:  
It is more important to prevent or reduce the risk of future pandemics  
Prevention can be accomplished by improving immune systems  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; By increasing the vitamin D levels   
&nbsp; &nbsp; For both humans and poultry (source of bird FLU)** 

Outbreaks of bird flu have been occurring more frequently since the 1990's

So far, the bird flu appears to be only passed from bird to human, and not yet human to human

It appears that some of the bird flus could result in be 5X worse viral pandemic than COVID-19

- with both increased transmisability and mortality
