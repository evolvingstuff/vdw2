**FACT:**  Vitamins, such as vitamin D, are needed to reduce hair loss

 **FACT:**  Chemotherapy reduces vitamin D

 **OBSERVATION:**  Vitamin D reduces hair loss due to chemotherapy: reasons include:

1. Vitamin D can reduce the amount of chemo needed, so less hair is killed off

1. Fewer chemo results in less reduction in Vitamin D

1. Vitamin D can keep the hair healthy.

### Role of vitamin D in hair loss: A short review – 2021

J Cosmet Dermatol [doi: 10.1111/jocd.14421](https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14421)

Kriteeka Saini 1, Venkataram Mysore 1

Background: Vitamin D, a vitamin and hormone, plays an important role in dermatology and dermatotherapeutics, due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. It also affects the hair cycle, and its role in hair loss is under constant research.

Objectives: This review aims to give a brief overview of vitamin D biology within the hair follicle, its role in etiopathogenesis, and the rationale for supplementation in various alopecias.

Methods: A PubMed literature search was performed to review relevant current literature and studies investigating the role of vitamin D in etiopathogenesis as a supplement and a potential therapeutic modality in hair loss.

Results and conclusion: Vitamin D is intricately involved in various signaling pathways of growth and differentiation of hair follicles. Most studies show an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and non-scarring alopecias, such as telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and trichotillomania. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with scarring alopecia. However, conclusive studies to demonstrate the benefit of vitamin D administration in correcting hair loss and managing these conditions are lacking. Hence, further studies are needed before vitamin D can be routinely

### Hair and the founder of VitaminDWiki

#### Noticed more hair growth after added Gluathione, Protein, and weekly Omega-3  May 2025

Those were the only changes in supplements that I recall for the past 6 months

Perplelexity AI indicates that each of them should increase hair growth <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/hair---glutathione-protein-and-omega-3.pdf">PDF</a>

#### Great hair regrowth June 2012: Henry Lahore, admin of VitaminDWiki

By having a high level of vitamin D for over 2 years helped <a href="/posts/reduce-many-aches-and-pains" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 31">reduce many aches and pains</a>, but did not stop or even slow my hair loss (age 66)

Even taking all of the bone/vitamin D <a href="/posts/cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">cofactors</a> did not stop hair loss (Magnesium, Silicon, Boron, etc)

However, 2 months ago, I decided to add scalp massage, which had really helped my father re-populate his scalp

(he was a carpenter who worked most of his life outdoors, probably getting plenty of vitamin D)

Nightly 3-minute scalp massage (to increase blood circulation) resulted in detectable hair re-growth in 2 weeks and excellent regrowth in 6 weeks.

I leave the scalp massager plugged in next to the bed so that it takes no time to set up for the nightly massage.

 **Update 2021 Using a muscle massage gun - far deeper and feels better** 

#### Observation:  **Vitamin D3 + cofactors + massage**  has worked extremely well for me.

Perhaps just massage would have helped, I do not know.

 **Conclusion for others: None:**  I have no idea if the combination will work for you.

### The Hair Cycle and Vitamin D Receptor - 2011

Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, doi:10.1016/j.abb.2011.10.002

Marie B. Demay, Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 50 Blossom St, Thier 11, Boston, MA 02114

The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a critical role in epidermal homeostasis. The ligand-dependent actions of the VDR attenuate epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and promote keratinocyte differentiation. Calcium can compensate for the absence of the VDR in maintaining a normal program of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the effects of VDR ablation on the hair follicle cannot be prevented by maintaining normal calcium levels and are independent of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. These actions of the VDR are critical in the keratinocyte stem cell population that resides in the bulge region of the hair follicle. The absence of a functional VDR leads to a self-renewal and lineage progression defect in this population of stem cells, resulting in the absence of post-morphogenic hair cycles. The molecular partners and downstream target genes of the VDR in this unique population of cells have not yet been identified.

### Female hair

#### Female pattern hair loss treatment augmented by Vitamin D – Jan 2022

 **<span style="color:#00F;">This study used oral Vitamin D. Topical Vitamin D would probably be better</span>** 

 **Treatment with oral vitamin D alone, topical minoxidil, or combination of both in patients with female pattern hair loss: A comparative clinical and dermoscopic study** 

J Cosmet Dermatol. 2022 Jan 10. [doi: 10.1111/jocd.14743](https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14743)

Ghada F R Hassan 1, Manar E T Sadoma 1, Manal M Elbatsh 1, Zainab A Ibrahim 1

Background: One of the most common dermatological complaints among females is female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Serum vitamin D is a factor lately taken into consideration in approaching patients complaining of hair loss.

Aim: To evaluate the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with FPHL and to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D therapy alone or combined with minoxidil in the treatment of this disease.

Methods: 45 patients with FPHL and 15 controls to measure serum levels of vitamin D were enrolled in the study. Patients then were subdivided into 3 groups: group I received topical minoxidil and oral vitamin D, group II received topical minoxidil, and Group III received oral vitamin D for 6 months. Clinical and dermoscopic evaluation was done for the three groups before and after treatment.

Results: Vitamin D level was significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. After treatment, as regards the Ludwig scale, there was a statistically significant improvement in group I than II, while no significant improvement was found in group III. Dermoscopy revealed that thin hair and single-hair unit were significantly improved in groups I and II, while it was not significantly improved in group III.

Conclusion: Oral vitamin D combination with topical minoxidil is recommended to treat patients with FPHL; they had better results than vitamin D or topical minoxidil alone.

#### Serum ferritin and vitamin D in female hair loss: do they play a role? - 2013

 **[URL](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23428658)** 

Skin Pharmacol Physiol. 2013;26(2):101-7. [doi: 10.1159/000346698](https://doi.org/10.1159/000346698)

AIM: Evaluation of serum ferritin and vitamin D levels in females with chronic telogen effluvium (TE) or female pattern hair loss (FPHL) in order to validate their role in these common hair loss diseases.

METHODS: Eighty females (18 to 45 years old) with hair loss in the form of TE or FPHL and 40 age-matched females with no hair loss were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on clinical examination as well as trichogram and dermoscopy. Serum ferritin and vitamin D2 levels were determined for each participant.

RESULTS: Serum ferritin levels in the TE (14.7 ± 22.1 μg/l) and FPHL (23.9 ± 38.5 μg/l) candidates were significantly lower than in controls (43.5 ± 20.4 μg/l). Serum vitamin D2 levels in females with

* TE (28.8 ± 10.5 nmol/l) and

* FPHL (29.1 ± 8.5 nmol/l) was significantly lower than in

* controls (118.2 ± 68.1 nmol/l; p < 0.001).

These levels decreased with increased disease severity.

Serum ferritin cut-off values for TE and FPHL were 27.5 and 29.4 μg/l, respectively, and those for vitamin D were 40.9 and 67.9 nmol/l.

CONCLUSION: Low serum ferritin and vitamin D2 are associated with hair loss in females with TE and FPHL. Screening to establish these levels in cases of hair loss and supplementing with them when they are deficient may be beneficial in the treatment of disease.

#### Serum Vitamin D in Patients with alopecia areata Sept 2016

 **[Indian Dermatol Online J. 2016 Sep-Oct;7(5):371-377](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730032)**

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/aa-severity.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, recurrent, autoimmune hair disorder. It has been found that vitamin D deficiency is associated with many autoimmune diseases.

AIMS: The current study aimed to estimate serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with AA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 60 patients with AA and 60 age, gender, skin phototype, and body mass index-matched healthy subjects as a control group. Levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D were estimated using the ELISA technique.

RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were significantly lower in AA cases when compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). The least values were significantly associated with alopecia totalis/universalis compared with patchy AA (P < 0.001) and opiates (P = 0.04). Severe AA showed significantly the lowest vitamin D levels compared with cases with mild (P = 0.002) and moderate disease (P = 0.03). A significant inverse correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and the age of the patients (r = -0.38; P = 0.03). There was no significant association between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and gender, disease duration, disease recurrence, nail affection, duration of sun exposure/day, or positive family history of AA.

CONCLUSION: AA patients have lower levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D than healthy subjects. More studies are required to assess the value of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of that disease.

#### Female pattern hair loss treatment augmented by Vitamin D – Jan 2022

 **<span style="color:#00F;">This study used oral Vitamin D. Topical Vitamin D would probably be better</span>** 

 **Treatment with oral vitamin D alone, topical minoxidil, or combination of both in patients with female pattern hair loss: A comparative clinical and dermoscopic study** 

J Cosmet Dermatol. 2022 Jan 10. [doi: 10.1111/jocd.14743](https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14743)

Background: One of the most common dermatological complaints among females is female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Serum vitamin D is a factor lately taken into consideration in approaching patients complaining of hair loss.

Aim: To evaluate the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with FPHL and to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D therapy alone or combined with minoxidil in the treatment of this disease.

Methods: 45 patients with FPHL and 15 controls to measure serum levels of vitamin D were enrolled in the study. Patients then were subdivided into 3 groups: group I received topical minoxidil and oral vitamin D, group II received topical minoxidil, and Group III received oral vitamin D for 6 months. Clinical and dermoscopic evaluation was done for the three groups before and after treatment.

Results: Vitamin D level was significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. After treatment, as regards the Ludwig scale, there was a statistically significant improvement in group I than II, while no significant improvement was found in group III. Dermoscopy revealed that thin hair and single-hair unit were significantly improved in groups I and II, while it was not significantly improved in group III.

Conclusion: Oral vitamin D combination with topical minoxidil is recommended to treat patients with FPHL; they had better results than vitamin D or topical minoxidil alone.

Summary of [NYT Aug 2022](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/health/minoxidil-hair-loss-pills.html)

1) Rogaine (as a pill) was originally made for heart problems

2) Discovered it helped regrow hair

3) Rogaine was made as a topical for hair growth and was approved by the FDA

4) Topical Minoxidil was made a topical for hair regrowth (available on Amazon)

5) Some people find Topical Minoxidil unpleasant in their hair

6) Minoxidil pill is available by prescription for off-label use for hair regrowth

- - - Suspect that topical minoxidil + topical vitamin D would work well

 **Comment from Consumerlab Aug 2022** 

 **Minoxidil**  is a commonly used topical drug (sold over-the-counter as Rogaine) for preventing further hair loss or promoting hair regrowth, although not all people find that it works. Among those who do experience benefits, treatment must be continued indefinitely since stopping leads to a re-loss of hair within about 6 months.

There is preliminary evidence that minoxidil may be beneficial for hair loss when taken  **orally in low doses** , although reduced blood pressure and unwanted facial hair may occur. Several preliminary studies have shown benefits for  **female-pattern hair loss**  (at 0.25 to 2.5 mg per day) and  **male-pattern baldness**  (at 2.5 to 5 mg per day). When used for female-pattern hair loss, some experts consider the combination of 0.25 mg of minoxidil and 25 mg of spironolactone daily to be the best option due to a lower rate of occurrence of unwanted facial hair because spironolactone blocks sex hormones that can cause unwanted hair growth ([Randolph, J Am Acad Dermatol 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32622136/)). For example, a study among 100 women (average age 48) with female-pattern hair loss found that taking this combination for 12 months provided a meaningful increase in hair volume and a decrease in hair shedding. However, oral minoxidil (which is approved as a blood pressure lowering drug) reduced average systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4.52 mmHg and 6.48 mmHg, respectively, and two patients developed postural hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing). In addition, four women reported excessive hair growth that required plucking or waxing ([Sinclair, Int J Dermatol 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231239/)).

People interested in taking minoxidil orally should be aware that this use is "off-label" (meaning it is an unapproved use of the prescription drug), and it is still unlikely to benefit people with severe hair loss, such as those who are already bald. ( **Note** : Topical minoxidil formulations should never be taken orally as a substitute for oral minoxidil).

1. Vitamin D can reduce the amount of chemo needed, so less hair is killed off

1. Fewer chemo results in less reduction in Vitamin D

1. Vitamin D can keep the hair healthy.

Background: Vitamin D, a vitamin and hormone, plays an important role in dermatology and dermatotherapeutics, due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. It also affects the hair cycle, and its role in hair loss is under constant research.

Objectives: This review aims to give a brief overview of vitamin D biology within the hair follicle, its role in etiopathogenesis, and the rationale for supplementation in various alopecias.

Methods: A PubMed literature search was performed to review relevant current literature and studies investigating the role of vitamin D in etiopathogenesis as a supplement and a potential therapeutic modality in hair loss.

Results and conclusion: Vitamin D is intricately involved in various signaling pathways of growth and differentiation of hair follicles. Most studies show an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and non-scarring alopecias, such as telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and trichotillomania. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with scarring alopecia. However, conclusive studies to demonstrate the benefit of vitamin D administration in correcting hair loss and managing these conditions are lacking. Hence, further studies are needed before vitamin D can be routinely

##### Clipped from above on chemotherapy-induced hair loss

"...Limited studies have been done in humans to elaborate the role of vitamin D in the hair cycle. A potential application for vitamin D is chemotherapy-induced hair loss. Topical calcitriol has been shown to protect against chemotherapy-induced alopecia caused by paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide. However, topical calcitriol failed to protect against chemotherapy-induced hair loss caused by a combination of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide and a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil <sup>[36, 37]</sup>.”

#### The Hair Cycle and Vitamin D Receptor - 2011

The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a critical role in epidermal homeostasis. The ligand-dependent actions of the VDR attenuate epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and promote keratinocyte differentiation. Calcium can compensate for the absence of the VDR in maintaining a normal program of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the effects of VDR ablation on the hair follicle cannot be prevented by maintaining normal calcium levels and are independent of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. These actions of the VDR are critical in the keratinocyte stem cell population that resides in the bulge region of the hair follicle. The absence of a functional VDR leads to a self-renewal and lineage progression defect in this population of stem cells, resulting in the absence of post-morphogenic hair cycles. The molecular partners and downstream target genes of the VDR in this unique population of cells have not yet been identified.

AIM: Evaluation of serum ferritin and vitamin D levels in females with chronic telogen effluvium (TE) or female pattern hair loss (FPHL) in order to validate their role in these common hair loss diseases.

METHODS: Eighty females (18 to 45 years old) with hair loss in the form of TE or FPHL and 40 age-matched females with no hair loss were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on clinical examination as well as bronchogram and dermoscopy. Serum ferritin and vitamin D2 levels were determined for each participant.

RESULTS: Serum ferritin levels in the TE (14.7 ± 22.1 μg/l) and FPHL (23.9 ± 38.5 μg/l) candidates were significantly lower than in controls (43.5 ± 20.4 μg/l). Serum vitamin D2 levels in females with

* TE (28.8 ± 10.5 nmol/l) and

* FPHL (29.1 ± 8.5 nmol/l) was significantly lower than in

* controls (118.2 ± 68.1 nmol/l; p < 0.001).

These levels decreased with increased disease severity.

Serum ferritin cut-off values for TE and FPHL were 27.5 and 29.4 μg/l, respectively, and those for vitamin D were 40.9 and 67.9 nmol/l.

CONCLUSION: Low serum ferritin and vitamin D2 are associated with hair loss in females with TE and FPHL. Screening to establish these levels in cases of hair loss and supplementing with them when they are deficient may be beneficial in the treatment of disease.

BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common, recurrent, autoimmune hair disorder. It has been found that vitamin D deficiency is associated with many autoimmune diseases.

AIMS: The current study aimed to estimate serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with AA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study included 60 patients with AA and 60 age, gender, skin phototype, and body mass index-matched healthy subjects as a control group. Levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D were estimated using the ELISA technique.

RESULTS: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were significantly lower in AA cases when compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). The least values were significantly associated with alopecia totalis/universalis compared with patchy AA (P < 0.001) and opiates (P = 0.04). Severe AA showed significantly the lowest vitamin D levels compared with cases with mild (P = 0.002) and moderate disease (P = 0.03). A significant inverse correlation was found between 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and the age of the patients (r = -0.38; P = 0.03). There was no significant association between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and gender, disease duration, disease recurrence, nail affection, duration of sun exposure/day, or positive family history of AA.

CONCLUSION: AA patients have lower levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D than healthy subjects. More studies are required to assess the value of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of that disease.

### Female pattern hair loss VitD: 13.5 ng vs controls(no FP hair loss): 17.2 ng -2016

 **Serum Vitamin D3 Level in Patients with Female Pattern Hair Loss.** 

Int J Trichology. 2016 Jul-Sep;8(3):116-20. doi 10.4103/0974-7753.188965.

BACKGROUND: Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is the most common cause of alopecia in women, characterized by diffuse nonscarring hair loss in the frontal, central, and parietal areas of the scalp. The pathophysiology of FPHL is still not well known, and it is probably a multifactorial genetic trait. FPHL is also observed in women without increased androgen levels, which raises the likelihood of androgen-independent mechanisms and explains the lack of response to antiandrogen treatments in some patients. Vitamin D is a factor that has recently been considered in dealing with these patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of Vitamin D in patients with FPHL and compare them with healthy controls.

METHODS: In this case-control study, 45 women with FPHL were evaluated, as well as the same number of healthy women matched for age, hours spent under sunlight per day, and body mass index. Serum 25(OH) D3 level was measured using ELISA.

RESULTS: 60% of FPHL patients were in the 15-30 years old age group with a mean standard deviation (SD) age of 29.11 (7.30) years. In the majority of patients (66.7%), the severity of hair loss was Ludwig I. Mean (SD) serum Vitamin D3 level in the patient and control group was 13.45 (8.40) and 17.16 (8.96), respectively. T-test showed a significant difference between the two groups in terms of Vitamin D3 serum levels (P = 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the correlation between the incidence of FPHL and decreased serum levels of Vitamin D3. It is recommended to evaluate serum Vitamin D3 levels as well as other hormone assays in these patients.

Background: One of the most common dermatological complaints among females is female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Serum vitamin D is a factor lately taken into consideration in approaching patients complaining of hair loss.

Aim: To evaluate the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with FPHL and to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D therapy alone or combined with minoxidil in the treatment of this disease.

Methods: 45 patients with FPHL and 15 controls to measure serum levels of vitamin D were enrolled in the study. Patients then were subdivided into 3 groups: group I received topical minoxidil and oral vitamin D, group II received topical minoxidil, and Group III received oral vitamin D for 6 months. Clinical and dermoscopic evaluation was done for the three groups before and after treatment.

Results: Vitamin D level was significantly decreased in patients compared to controls. After treatment, as regards the Ludwig scale, there was a statistically significant improvement in group I than II, while no significant improvement was found in group III. Dermoscopy revealed that thin hair and single-hair unit were significantly improved in groups I and II, while it was not significantly improved in group III.

Conclusion: Oral vitamin D combination with topical minoxidil is recommended to treat patients with FPHL;  **they had better results than vitamin D or topical minoxidil alone** .

 **Comment from Consumerlab Aug 2022** 

 **Minoxidil**  is a commonly used topical drug (sold over-the-counter as Rogaine) for preventing further hair loss or promoting hair regrowth, although not all people find that it works. Among those who do experience benefits, treatment must be continued indefinitely since stopping leads to a re-loss of hair within about 6 months.

There is preliminary evidence that minoxidil may be beneficial for hair loss when taken  **orally in low doses** , although reduced blood pressure and unwanted facial hair may occur. Several preliminary studies have shown benefits for  **female-pattern hair loss**  (at 0.25 to 2.5 mg per day) and  **male-pattern baldness**  (at 2.5 to 5 mg per day). When used for female-pattern hair loss, some experts consider the combination of 0.25 mg of minoxidil and 25 mg of spironolactone daily to be the best option due to a lower rate of occurrence of unwanted facial hair because spironolactone blocks sex hormones that can cause unwanted hair growth ([Randolph, J Am Acad Dermatol 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32622136/)). For example, a study among 100 women (average age 48) with female-pattern hair loss found that taking this combination for 12 months provided a meaningful increase in hair volume and decrease in hair shedding. However, oral minoxidil (which is approved as a blood pressure lowering drug) reduced average systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4.52 mmHg and 6.48 mmHg, respectively, and two patients developed postural hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing). In addition, four women reported excessive hair growth that required plucking or waxing ([Sinclair, Int J Dermatol 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29231239/)).

People interested in taking minoxidil orally should be aware that this use is "off-label" (meaning it is an unapproved use of the prescription drug), and it is still unlikely to benefit people with severe hair loss, such as those who are already bald. ( **Note** : Topical minoxidil formulations should never be taken orally as a substitute for oral minoxidil).
