"National population sampling showed that most people were already getting enough of the vitamin"

"...most people probably don't need supplements"

"...noting that the majority of the population is just fine at 16 ng/ml."

"...Levels have actually risen since <sup>[2010]</sup>"  Actually, levels [have fallen](/posts/4-reasons-why-vitamin-d-levels-are-crashing)

Describes the failure of 4 trials that used too little vitamin D

Does not mention the >700 successful Vitamin D Randomized Controled Trials (see below)

#### The IoM math mistakes made in 2010 and admitted to in 2017 have not been yet corrected

 **[Vitamin D math mistakes made by the IoM in 2010 â€“ K Baggerly 2016-2017](/posts/vitamin-d-math-mistakes-made-by-the-iom-in-2010-k-baggerly-2016-2017)** 

* Mistake #1: % of cadavers with poor bones with 20-30 ng of vitamin D

   * 8%, not 1% of the people having >20 ng/ml had bone loss, so the 20 ng/ml voted level was incorrect

   * should have concluded 30 ng, not 20 ng

* Mistake #2: Not having enough data to conclude that >4,000 IU is too much (i.e. harm)

* Mistake #3: Institute of Medicine used data only for bone health, but the rest of the body needs higher levels

* Mistake #4): Incorrectly estimated dose needed to get 97.5 % of population to a vitamin D level
