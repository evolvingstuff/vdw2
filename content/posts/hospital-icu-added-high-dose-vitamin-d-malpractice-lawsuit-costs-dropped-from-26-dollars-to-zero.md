"In the United States, a quick Google search states that only about 1 in 3,500 hospital patients files a malpractice lawsuit. In almost a decade, we have treated over 7,000 patients without a lawsuit to put it in patient numbers and a 3% mortality rate in 2015. Thatâ€™s zero dollars paid out in malpractice lawsuits/claims over the past decade. Thirty percent (30%) of our trauma is penetrating which is very high with many victims being shot multiple times. Grady Memorial Hospital is also one of the busiest Level 1 trauma center in the United States."

"Hospitals and insurance companies can save billions of dollars by using high dose vitamin D to reduce 

* hospital mortality rates, 

* hospital length of stay, 

* medical errors, 

* malpractice lawsuits, and 

* overall hospital costs."

 **A quote from the study** 

* "The cost of medical malpractice lawsuits in the United States is running approximately $55.6 billion a year in direct cost, says a Harvard School of Health study. Add another $50 billion in lost work productivity"
