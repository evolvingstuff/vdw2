#### Metabolic Disorders Post-COVID-19 Vaccinations

 **[TrialSite News](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/metabolic-disorders-post-covid-19-vaccinations-a42a56a6)** 

"While [cardiovascular disorders](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37973371/;%20https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/are-covid-19-vaccine-induced-adverse-cardiovascular-events-rare-01b2657e), cancers ([link#1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37243095/); [link#2](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/are-covid-19-vaccine-induced-cancers-rare-events-806312db)), immune system disorders ([link#1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37710966/); [link#2](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/are-covid-19-vaccine-induced-adverse-autoimmune-events-rare-8c55ed90)), and neurological disorders ([link#1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36788995/); [link#2](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/are-covid-19-vaccine-induced-adverse-neurological-events-rare-6adb293f)) post-COVID-19 vaccination have been studied to a modest extent, metabolic disorders following COVID-19 vaccination have not been studied to the same extent.  "

* "To obtain the VAERS results for post-COVID-19 vaccination metabolic disorders, the final list of ~3100 MedDRA LLT terms (see Appendix 1 for the specific MedDRA query used to identify metabolic disorder-related symptoms in VAERS) was intersected with all the ~18,000 VAERS terms, resulting in  **335 VAERS symptoms (with non-zero entries) related to metabolic disorders post-COVID-19 vaccination**  (see Appendix 2 for the VAERS COVID-19 results).
