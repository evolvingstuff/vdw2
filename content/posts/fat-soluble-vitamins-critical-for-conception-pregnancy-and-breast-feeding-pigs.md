#### [Critical times for fat-soluble vitamin intake for today's swine](https://www.nationalhogfarmer.com/nutrition/critical-times-fat-soluble-vitamin-intake-todays-swine) National Hog Farmer

* “The 2012 NRC Nutrient Requirements of Swine has the most recent requirements for fat-soluble vitamins.  Requirements for vitamin A and vitamin E were not increased from the 1998 NRC publication, but the  **vitamin D requirement was increased four-fold from 200 to 800 I.U. per kg diet.** ”

 **Thus Pigs eating 1 kilogram of food per day should get at least 800 IU of vitamin D**
