36	Abstract

37	The extent to which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of

38	concern (VOC) break through infection- or vaccine-induced immunity is not well understood. Here,

39	we analyze 28,578 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from individuals with known immune status

40	obtained through national community testing in the Netherlands from March to August 2021. We

41	find evidence for an increased risk of infection by the Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), or Delta

42	(B.1.617.2) variants compared to the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant after vaccination. No clear differences

43	were found between vaccines. However, the effect was larger in the first 14-59 days after complete

44	vaccination compared to 60 days and longer. In contrast to vaccine-induced immunity, no increased

45	risk for reinfection with Beta, Gamma or Delta variants relative to Alpha variant was found in

46	individuals with infection-induced immunity.
