| Magnesium supplement | Characteristics |
| Magnesium glycinate | A chelated form of magnesium that tends to provide effective levels of absorption and bioavailability. |
| Magnesium oxide | A non-chelated form of magnesium bound to an organic acid or fatty acid. Contains up to 60% elemental magnesium and has stool-softening properties. |
| Magnesium chloride/ Magnesium lactate | Contains only about 12% elemental magnesium but tends to have better absorption capabilities than magnesium oxide which has 5 times the magnesium.<br>Henry Lahore, Admin of VitaminDWiki((Low cost cofactors for vitamin D | takes MgCl - both orally and topically)) |
| Magnesium sulfate/ Magnesium hydroxide | These are typically used as laxatives. Milk of Magnesia is an example of this type of magnesium. Since magnesium hydroxide can have up to 42% elemental magnesium, caution is required here not to take too much. |
| Magnesium carbonate | This form of magnesium has antacid properties and can contain from 29-45% elemental magnesium. |
| Magnesium taurate | This contains a combination of magnesium and taurine (an amino acid) that together may provide a calming effect on the body and mind. |
| Magnesium citrate | This is a form of magnesium with citric acid which has laxative properties. This can contain up to 16% elemental magnesium. |
| Magnesium threonate | This newer, emerging type of magnesium supplement has shown great promise in absorption, as well as potential tissue and cell membrane penetration  <br>Mercola recommends  and sells threonate. |
