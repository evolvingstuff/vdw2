Aim

This study evaluated the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation in the reduction of plasma glucose levels in adults with prediabetes and hypomagnesaemia.

Methods

A total of 116 men and non-pregnant women, aged 30 to 65 years with hypomagnesaemia and newly diagnosed with prediabetes, were enrolled into a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to receive either 30 mL of MgCl2 5% solution (equivalent to 382 mg of magnesium) or an inert placebo solution once daily for four months. The primary trial endpoint was the efficacy of magnesium supplementation in reducing plasma glucose levels.

Results

At baseline, there were no significant statistical differences in terms of anthropometric and biochemical variables between individuals in the supplement and placebo groups. At the end of follow-up, 

* fasting (86.9 ± 7.9 and 98.3 ± 4.6 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.004) and 

* post-load glucose (124.7 ± 33.4 and 136.7 ± 23.9 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.03) levels, 

* HOMA-IR indices (2.85 ± 1.0 and 4.1 ± 2.7, respectively; P = 0.04) and 

* triglycerides (166.4 ± 90.6 and 227.0 ± 89.7, respectively; P = 0.009) 

were significantly decreased, whereas HDL cholesterol (45.6 ± 10.9 and 46.8 ± 9.2 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.04) and serum magnesium (1.96 ± 0.27 and 1.60 ± 0.26 mg/dL, respectively; P = 0.005) levels were significantly increased in those taking MgCl2 compared with the controls. 

 **A total of 34 (29.4%) people improved their glucose status (50.8% and 7.0%**  in the magnesium and placebo groups, respectively; P < 0.0005).

Conclusion

Our results show that magnesium supplementation reduces plasma glucose levels, and improves the glycaemic status of adults with prediabetes and hypomagnesaemia.
