 **Summary by VitaminDWiki** 

* Homo sapiens got vitamin D from seafood and sea mammals

* “Greenfield (in the book below) points out that only the Homo sapiens immigrants had developed cultural practices that included fishing and/or eating the meat and fat of marine mammals.”

* Neanderthals had weak immune systems due to lack of vitamin D

* Homo sapiens germs won.

* Homo sapiens germs also killed out many homo sapiens natives (e.g. in the Western Hemisphere) who did not have immunity to the arriving germs.  

*  **Wonder if those natives also lacked vitamin D**

### Comment

The 1999 Pulitzer Prize book  **Germs, Guns, Steel**  by  Jared M. Diamond made a strong case for germs killing off the natives,  I do not recall anything about the lack of seafood/vitamin D in the natives.
