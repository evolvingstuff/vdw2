# FAO and WHO call for data on vitamin and mineral recommendations

Codex Committee on Nutrition and Food for Special Dietary Uses: Nutrient Reference Values

The 32nd Session of the Codex Committee on Nutrition and Food for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU) requested the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide the 33rd session of CCNFSDU (November 2011) with a report of existing daily vitamin and mineral intake reference values for apparently healthy populations of adult males (preferably aged 19-65 years) and adult females (preferably aged 19- 50 years). This information should be collected from data sources published after 1998 from recognized authoritative scientific bodies and from FAO/WHO.

 **Vitamins 	Minerals** 

Vitamin A 	 **Calcium** 

 **Vitamin D**  	 **Magnesium** 

Vitamin E 	Iodine

 **Vitamin K**  	Iron

Vitamin C 	Zinc

Thiamin 	Selenium

Riboflavin 	Copper

Niacin 	Chloride

Vitamin B6 	Chromium (3+)

Folate 	Sodium

Vitamin B12 	Fluoride

Pantothenate 	Manganese

Biotin 	Molybdenum

Phosphorus

Potassium

## The following are detailed variables to be included in the report:

* The values themselves

* Applicable age ranges

* Physiological endpoints used to establish the INL50 or similar, or other measures such as AI and the reason for the choice

* Method of calculation of INL98 or similar from INL50 or similar including coefficients of variation

* Reference body weights and basis for extrapolation methods if used

* Determination of or assumptions about dietary bioavailability of the vitamins or minerals

* Conversion factors applied to provitamins, isomers or other relevant nutrients to units of equivalents such as niacin equivalents.

* Year that scientific evaluation was conducted

* Basis for the value i.e., primary evaluation or derivation from other countriesâ€™ values

## Deadline for submission

* The requested data should be submitted before 15 August 2011.
