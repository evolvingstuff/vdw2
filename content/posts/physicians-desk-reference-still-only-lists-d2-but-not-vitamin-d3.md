#### [Vitamin D2](http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/Drisdol-ergocalciferol-1904) in Physicians Desk Reference

 **And, even the Vitamin D2 information is seriously out of date** 

 **Examples of out-of-date statements:** 

* To restore a deficiency to use  50,000 IU of D2 weekly for 6 weeks – WITH NO FOLLOW-ON maintenance dose

> Note D2 daily is about 5X less effective than D3 daily

* For the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis: 800 IU

* For the prevention of premenstrual syndrome: 700 IU

* “Ergocalciferol is contraindicated in patients with malabsorption syndrome”

> However, a gut-friendly form of Vitamin D3 works well

* “Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) is classified as FDA pregnancy risk category C”

* “The recommended maternal daily allowance of vitamin D during breast-feeding is 600 International Units/day”

* “Magnesium-containing drug products and magnesium salts should be used cautiously in patients receiving vitamin D.”

> Actually, Magnesium is a great Vitamin D3 cofactor

* No mention appears to be made of other forms: Topical. Sublingual. Injection,  gut-friendly

#### Bio-Tech has been supplying Vitamin D3 in 50,000 IU since year 2000, and 5,000 IU before that

 **WHOLESALER ORDER numbers for BIO-TECH 50,000 IU IU Vitamin D** 

Which costs less (and more profit for pharmacy) than D2-50,000
