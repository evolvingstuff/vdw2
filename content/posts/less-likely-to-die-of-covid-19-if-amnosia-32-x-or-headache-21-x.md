 **Conclusions and Relevance:** 

Headache as a primary disorder is more prevalent in nations with higher  COVID-19  mortality,  

whereas  headache  as  a  COVID-19  symptom  is  associated  with enhanced  survival.  

Further  studies  should  clarify  whether  primary  headache  disorders 

represent a risk factor for mortality for COVID-19 or, rather, whether this association reflects 

evolutionary  adaptive  processes  to  enhance  survival  that,  in  the  case  of  COVID-19, are insufficiently protective.

Unclear if amnosia is considered to be a COVID-19 symptom or just prevelance in the country before COVID-19

#### Anosmia in COVID-19: Underlying Mechanisms and Assessment of an Olfactory Route to Brain Infection = Sept 2020

In recent months it has emerged that the novel coronavirus—responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic—causes reduction of smell and taste in a large fraction of patients. The chemosensory deficits are often the earliest, and sometimes the only signs in otherwise asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The reasons for the surprisingly early and specific chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 are now beginning to be elucidated. In this hypothesis review, we discuss implications of the recent finding that the prevalence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 patients differs between populations, possibly because of differences in the spike protein of different virus strains or because of differences in the host proteins that enable virus entry, thus modifying infectivity. We review recent progress in defining underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of the virus-induced anosmia, with a focus on the emerging crucial role of sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium. We critically examine the current evidence whether and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus can follow a route from the olfactory epithelium in the nose to the brain to achieve brain infection, and we discuss the prospects for using the smell and taste dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 as an early and rapid diagnostic screening tool.

Many people are being hospitalized and are dying from COVID-19 as the right treatment has not yet been identified. We investigate the factors related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 using big data-machine learning techniques. This retrospective study included 8070 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients of the 129,120 SARS-CoV-2 RNA tested patients in South Korea between January and July 2020, and whose data were available from the National Health Insurance Service. Primary endpoint was comorbidity, severity and mortality rate in COVID-19. Machine learning algorithms were performed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities on severity and mortality rate of COVID-19. The most common comorbidities of COVID-19 were pulmonary inflammation followed by anosmia. The model that best predicted severity was a neural network (AUC: 85.06%). The most important variable for predicting severity in the neural network model was a history of influenza (relative importance: 0.129). The model that best predicted mortality was the logistic regression elastic net (EN) model (AUC: 93.86%). The most important variables for mortality in the EN model were age (coefficient: 2.136) and anosmia (coefficient: –1.438). Through the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm and 8070 patients of COVID-19 patients in South Korea, influenza was found to be a major adverse factor in addition to old age and male sex. In addition, anosmia was found to be a major factor associated with lower severity and mortality rates. The patient’s history of influenza and anosmia will be an important indicator for predicting the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients.
