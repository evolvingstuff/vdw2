Background. Vitamin D deficiency impairs bone health and development. 

Objective. To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in pediatric international adoptees. 

Methods. A prospective cohort (N = 189) study from a single international adoption clinic was conducted. 

Total 25-hydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level was measured at the initial clinical assessment (within 6 months of adoption). 

Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL (<8 nmol/L) and insufficiency as 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL (<12 nmol/L). 

 **VitaminDWiki: Something wrong here: probably meant to state < 20ng (<span style="color:#00F;">50nmol</span>)** 

Results. Vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed in 8% and insufficiency in 27% of the cohort. 

Lower body mass index and longer time in an institution were associated with vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency independent of age. 

Conclusions. Vitamin D insufficiency was common in our cohort of international adoptees. 

The significance of vitamin D insufficiency on bone development during the typical “catch-up” growth following international adoption needs to be determined.

## VitaminDWiki Not really that much lower vitamin D than most infants
