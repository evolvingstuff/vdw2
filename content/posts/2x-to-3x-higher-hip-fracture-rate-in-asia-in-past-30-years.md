# Osteoporosis in Asia: A Call to Action.

Curr Osteoporos Rep. 2012 Aug 17.

Asia is witnessing a rapid growth in its aging population. Yet osteoporosis in this region has received relatively little attention. 

Hip fracture rates have increased by  **2- to 3-fold**  in most Asian countries during the past 30 years. 

Lack of quality epidemiologic data, widespread vitamin D deficiency, low dietary calcium intakes, and uneven access to diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are some of the major challenges faced in this region. 

Osteoporotic fractures constitute a huge medical, social, and economic burden in Asia. 

There is an urgent need to promote research, spread awareness, and build national health programs to check this growing problem.
