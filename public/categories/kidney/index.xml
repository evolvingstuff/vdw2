&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health concern with a complex etiological landscape. Among the numerous factors implicated, vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) has emerged as a focal point of scientific studies because of its critical role in vitamin D metabolism and immune modulation. The relationship between VDBP and CKD reveals a complex web of molecular and biochemical details that have great potential for improving diagnostic understanding and treatment strategies for CKD. This review summarizes the multifaceted roles of VDBP, including its molecular dynamics, interactions with vitamin D, and subsequent implications for kidney function.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney not helped much by little vitamin D (none got to a 75 nmol level) – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/chronic-kidney-not-helped-much-by-little-vitamin-d-none-got-to-a-75-nmol-level-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chronic-kidney-not-helped-much-by-little-vitamin-d-none-got-to-a-75-nmol-level-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is commonly observed in people with late-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease; it has also been associated with the progression of kidney disease. We hypothesized that VDD played a role in early-stage chronic kidney disease as well. Thus, this cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and CKD stages 1 through 3 (early-stage CKD) in a relatively healthy population in China. A total of 3142 Chinese individuals were included in this cross-sectional study. VDD was observed in 108 &lt;strong>(5.6%) males&lt;/strong> and 307 &lt;strong>(25.33%) females&lt;/strong> . We found a significant inverse association between serum 25(OH)D concentration with CKD stages in both sexes. Furthermore, VDD was associated with CKD stages 1 through 3 in males (adjusted odds ratio, &lt;strong>15.84&lt;/strong> ; 95% confidence interval, 7.85-31.98; P &amp;lt; .001), but not in females. Vitamin D status should be evaluated in people who are newly diagnosed with CKD stages 1 through 3 or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, especially in males.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney Disease needs Vitamin D - many studies</title><link>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-needs-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-needs-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

&lt;p>Hypomagnesemia is a common medical problem that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of patients with cancer. This review summarizes magnesium physiology and highlights the mechanisms underlying magnesium disturbances due to cancer and cancer treatment. The causes of hypomagnesemia can be categorized according to the pathophysiologic mechanism: decreased intake, transcellular shift, gastrointestinal losses, and kidney losses. Patients with cancer are at risk for opportunistic infections, frequently experience cardiovascular complications, and often receive classes of medications that cause or exacerbate hypomagnesemia. Also, cancer-specific therapies are responsible for hypomagnesemia, including platinum-based chemotherapy, anti-EGF receptor mAbs, human EGF receptor-2 target inhibitors (HER2), and calcineurin inhibitors. Urinary indices, such as the fractional excretion of magnesium, can provide useful information about the etiology. The management of hypomagnesemia depends on the magnitude of hypomagnesemia and the underlying cause. We recommended checking serum magnesium at the beginning of treatment and as part of routine monitoring throughout cancer treatment. Opportunities exist for potential research and practice improvement, including further characterization of hypomagnesemia regarding the clinical effect on cancer outcomes, preventing hypomagnesemia in patients receiving high-risk anticancer agents, and developing effective therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis): low Vitamin D and 22 X more likely to have kidney problems</title><link>/posts/inflammation-of-blood-vessels-vasculitis-low-vitamin-d-and-22-x-more-likely-to-have-kidney-problems.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/inflammation-of-blood-vessels-vasculitis-low-vitamin-d-and-22-x-more-likely-to-have-kidney-problems.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied with extensive cardiovascular calcification, in part correlating with functional vitamin K deficiency. Here, we sought to determine causes for vitamin K deficiency beyond reduced dietary intake. Initially, vitamin K uptake and distribution into circulating lipoproteins after a single administration of vitamin K1 plus K2 (menaquinone 4 and menaquinone 7, respectively) was determined in patients on dialysis therapy and healthy individuals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fully-activated Vitamin D (Calcitriol) is produced inside and outside of the kidneys</title><link>/posts/fully-activated-vitamin-d-calcitriol-is-produced-inside-and-outside-of-the-kidneys.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fully-activated-vitamin-d-calcitriol-is-produced-inside-and-outside-of-the-kidneys.html</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/autocrine-paracrine-endocrine.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

&lt;p>Background and objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem, which has a prevalence of 17.2% in India. As kidney function decreases, there is a gradual deterioration in the regulation of bone mineral homeostasis. Vitamin D is recognized as the central player in the maintenance of bonehealth in CKD. Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines suggest that vitamin D supplementation should be given to all CKD patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25(OH)D) level &amp;lt; 30 ng/mL. Hence we undertook this study to evaluate the vitamin D status in South Indian patients with CKD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney transplant rejection 1.8X more likely if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/kidney-transplant-rejection-18x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-transplant-rejection-18x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Chance of Acute Kidney Injury during next 20 years increased 35 percent if single low Vitamin D measurement</title><link>/posts/chance-of-acute-kidney-injury-during-next-20-years-increased-35-percent-if-singl-n-d-measurement.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chance-of-acute-kidney-injury-during-next-20-years-increased-35-percent-if-singl-n-d-measurement.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="25-hydroxyvitamin-d-fibroblast-growth-factor-23-and-risk-of-acute-kidney-injury-over-20-years-of-follow-up">25-hydroxyvitamin D, Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, and Risk of Acute Kidney Injury Over 20 Years of Follow-Up&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Nutritional status is a predictor of mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients. This study aimed to assess dietary behaviors in dialysis patients compared to the recommendations of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative. Ninety five dialysis patients recruited from a hospital completed a 24-hour dietary recall questionnaire. Body weight, energy requirements, protein requirements, albumin, normalized protein catabolic rate, and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were measured.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney diseases and COVID-19 – probably helped by Vitamin D etc.</title><link>/posts/kidney-diseases-and-covid-19-probably-helped-by-vitamin-d-etc.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-diseases-and-covid-19-probably-helped-by-vitamin-d-etc.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>A major concern for people taking doses of vitamin D3 above 10,000 iu per day (250 mcg) is the risk of severe kidney damage from excessive amounts of calcium circulating in the blood. Vitamin D3 regulates the absorption of calcium from food and water. The higher the dose of vitamin D3, the greater the amount of calcium that will be absorbed. Too much calcium is toxic to the kidneys and can cause kidney damage and even kidney failure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney Disease (stage 3) slowed by 30 ng of Vitamin D and Calcitriol</title><link>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-stage-3-slowed-by-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-and-calcitriol.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-stage-3-slowed-by-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-and-calcitriol.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="poor-kidneys-need-calcitriol">Poor Kidneys need Calcitriol&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients on dialysis. Although vitamin D deficiency is closely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and high mortality in the general population, the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients is uncertain. We aim to explore the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UV is one of the ways to increase Vitamin D levels, even with poor kidney</title><link>/posts/uv-is-one-of-the-ways-to-increase-vitamin-d-levels-even-with-poor-kidney.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/uv-is-one-of-the-ways-to-increase-vitamin-d-levels-even-with-poor-kidney.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="partial-body-uv-exposure-in-chronic-kidney-disease-and-extrarenal-vitamin-d-metabolism">Partial Body UV Exposure in Chronic Kidney Disease and Extrarenal Vitamin D Metabolism&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Evidence for the usefulness of using vitamin D to treat ‘renal bone disease’ is now nearly six decades old. In regular clinical practice, however, it is more like three decades, at most, that we have routinely been using vitamin D to try to prevent, or reverse, the impact of hyperparathyroidism on the skeleton of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The practice has been in the main to use high doses of synthetic vitamin D compounds, not naturally occurring ones. However, the pharmacological impacts of the different vitamin D species and of their different modes, and styles of administration cannot be assumed to be uniform across the spectrum. It is disappointingly true to say that even in 2016 there is a remarkable paucity of evidence concerning the clinical benefits of vitamin D supplementation to treat vitamin D insufficiency in patients with stage 3b–5 CKD. This is even more so if we consider the non-dialysis population. While there are a number of studies that report the impact of vitamin D supplementation on serum vitamin D concentrations (unsurprisingly, usually reporting an increase), and some variable evidence of parathyroid hormone concentration suppression, there has been much less focus on hard or semi-rigid clinical end point analysis (e.g. fractures, hospitalizations and overall mortality). Now, in 2016, with the practice pattern changes of first widespread clinical use of vitamin D and second widespread supplementation of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol by patients (alone, or as multivitamins), it is now, in my view, next to impossible to run a placebo-controlled trial over a decent period of time, especially one which involved clinically meaningful (fractures, hospitalisation, parathyroidectomy, death) end-points. In this challenging situation, we need to ask what it is we are trying to achieve here, and how best to balance potential benefits with potential harm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney failure 1.7X more likely - Vitamin D Binding Protein</title><link>/posts/kidney-failure-17x-more-likely-vitamin-d-binding-protein.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-failure-17x-more-likely-vitamin-d-binding-protein.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The complexity of the physiological system that controls serum calcium levels is remarkable. In the Figure we present a very simplified view of this system, stressing the crucial role of vitamin D and the kidneys in the overall complex. No wonder, the system without normal renal function turns out to be highly deranged. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is, unfortunately, very frequent, and metabolic bone disease, the result of specific alterations in calcium and phosphorus metabolism, one of its main complications(1). The availability of kidney transplantation provided a real step forward in CKD patients&amp;rsquo; survival and quality of life. For the majority of transplant patients, a return to nearly normal renal function is the more likely result(2).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Every child with kidney problems (ideopathic nephrotic syndrome) had low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/every-child-with-kidney-problems-ideopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-had-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/every-child-with-kidney-problems-ideopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-had-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Magnesium reduced calcitriol (active vitamin D) artery calcification in CKD by 50 percent</title><link>/posts/magnesium-reduced-calcitriol-active-vitamin-d-artery-calcification-in-ckd-by-50-percent.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/magnesium-reduced-calcitriol-active-vitamin-d-artery-calcification-in-ckd-by-50-percent.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="magnesium-modifies-the-impact-of-calcitriol-treatment-on-vascular-calcification-in-experimental-chronic-kidney-disease">Magnesium Modifies the impact of Calcitriol Treatment on Vascular Calcification in Experimental Chronic Kidney Disease.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are commonly treated with vitamin D analogs, such as calcitriol. Recent epidemiological evidence revealed a significant interaction between vitamin D and magnesium, since an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality mainly occurs in patients with a high magnesium intake. The aim of the study was to assess the mechanisms involved by determining whether magnesium alone or combined with calcitriol treatments differentially impact vascular calcification (VC) in male Sprague-Dawley rats with adenine-induced CKD. Treatment with moderate doses of calcitriol (80ug/kg) suppressed PTH to near or slightly below control levels. Given alone, this dose of calcitriol increased the prevalence of VC; but when magnesium was given in combination, the severity of calcification was attenuated in the abdominal aorta (51% reduction), iliac (44%) and carotid arteries (46%) compared to CKD controls. The decreases in vascular calcium content were associated with 20-50% increase in vascular Mg. Calcitriol treatment alone significantly decreased TRPM7 protein (↓ to ~11%) whereas the combination treatment increased both the mRNA (1.7X) and protein (6.8X) expression compared to calcitriol alone. In summary, calcitriol increased VC in certain conditions; but magnesium prevented the reduction in TRPM7 and reduced the severity of VC, thereby increasing the bioavailable magnesium in the vascular microenvironment. These findings suggest that modifying the adverse effect profile of calcitriol with Mg may be a plausible approach to benefiting the increasing number of CKD patients being prescribed calcitriol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>X-ray contrast agents can injure kidney in low vitamin D rats</title><link>/posts/x-ray-contrast-agents-can-injure-kidney-in-low-vitamin-d-rats.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/x-ray-contrast-agents-can-injure-kidney-in-low-vitamin-d-rats.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-is-a-potential-risk-factor-for-contrast-induced-nephropathy">Vitamin D deficiency is a potential risk factor for contrast-induced nephropathy&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>To the Editor:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The recent article by Hofmann and colleagues1 reported increased association of chronic kidney disease with renal cell carcinoma for blacks, Asians, and Hispanics, but not whites. The black-white disparity for renal cell carcinoma incidence for blacks was attributed to hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The authors recommended additional studies to evaluate the possible factors underlying the association between chronic kidney disease and risk of renal cell carcinoma. This letter outlines the evidence that racial differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> concentrations may explain the findings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiovascular risk - Editorial</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-the-autonomic-nervous-system-and-cardiovascular-risk-editorial.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-the-autonomic-nervous-system-and-cardiovascular-risk-editorial.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Physiological Reports &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.12349">doi: 10.14814/phy2.12349&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and vitamin D deficiency are extremely prevalent worldwide (Holick 2007; World Health Organization 2011). The potential link between vitamin D deficiency and CVD-related death in both healthy and diseased populations is a growing area of translational research. Historically, the traditional role of vitamin D in maintaining calcium homeostasis and mineral metabolism has been extensively studied (Lieben and Carmeliet 2013). Vitamin D, via its classical genomic transcriptional activity, is known to affect the physiological function of a number of target organs such as the heart, bone, and kidneys (Lieben et al. 2011). Furthermore, as highlighted in a paper published recently in Physiological Resports (Foong et al. 2014), there appears to be a link between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory symptoms in chronic lung disease. In addition, a number of nongenomic, rapid action roles of vitamin D are now known to affect tissue function, which fall outside the traditional role of regulating mineral metabolism (Gniadecki 1998; Brown et al. 1999; Norman et al. 2002; Haussler et al. 2011). While calcium and phosphate have long been regarded as the major players in the interactions observed between mineral metabolism dysfunction and CVD- related deaths, (Peacock 2010; Bolland et al. 2011; Brini et al. 2013), these newer nongenomic roles outside of the traditional target organs suggest that vitamin D itself may have intrinsic actions outside the realm of mineral metabolism (Gniadecki 1998; Brown et al. 1999; Norman et al. 2002; Haussler et al. 2011).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Itchy skin (pruritus) due to kidney disease was treated with topical vitamin D</title><link>/posts/itchy-skin-pruritus-due-to-kidney-disease-was-treated-with-topical-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/itchy-skin-pruritus-due-to-kidney-disease-was-treated-with-topical-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-topical-vitamin-d-on-chronic-kidney-disease-associated-pruritus-an-open-label-pilot-study">Effect of topical vitamin D on chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus: An open-label pilot study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have markedly higher rates of severe vitamin D deficiency and reduced ability to convert 25-(OH)vitamin D into the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. In the setting of CKD, secondary hyperparathyroidism develops as a consequence of reduced renal production of active vitamin D and phosphate retention resulting in hypocalcaemia and hyperpho- sphataemia. This is a process that is dangerously linked with metabolic bone disease, arterial calcifications and cardiovascular mortality &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>. Therefore, the conventional rationale for vitamin D treatment in CKD is to slow the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Calcitriol (active Vitamin D) recommended after kidney transplant</title><link>/posts/calcitriol-active-vitamin-d-recommended-after-kidney-transplant.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/calcitriol-active-vitamin-d-recommended-after-kidney-transplant.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="therapeutic-use-of-calcitriol">Therapeutic use of calcitriol.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The synthesis of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Calcitriol) takes place mostly in the kidneys through the action of 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) which converts 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)2D3. Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated by PTH, low calcium and low phosphate and it is reduced by high phosphate and FGF23. Binding of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to its receptor (VDR) causes gut absorption of calcium and phosphate, decrease in PTH synthesis, stimulation of FGF23. At the bone level calcitriol suppresses pre-osteoblasts and activates mature osteoblasts. VDR is present in a large variety of cells that do not have any direct role in the regulation of mineral metabolism. Calcitriol regulates immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation, Renin production, reduces proteinuria and others. In patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) there is a decrease in calcitriol that is apparent at early stages of renal disease; this is probably due to the elevation of FGF23 which is present since very early stage of CKD. In CKD stage, 3-4 moderate doses of calcitriol are effective to control secondary hyperparathyroidism and observational studies suggest that calcitriol therapy increases survival and slows the progression of renal disease as long as phosphate and calcium levels are controlled. Calcitriol (0.5 µg calcitriol twice per week) has been effective in decreasing proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy. In dialysis patients, the administration of calcitriol reduces serum PTH levels but it is also known that high doses of calcitriol are associated with hypercalcemia and worse control of hyperphosphatemia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D status unrelated to fractures with Kidney disease (should not be a surprise) – 2015</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-status-unrelated-to-fractures-with-kidney-disease-should-not-be-a-surprise-2015.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-status-unrelated-to-fractures-with-kidney-disease-should-not-be-a-surprise-2015.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Failed kidney cannot activate vitamin D, so measured vitamin D (before kidney) is not relevant&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Background: Although lack of Vitamin D is widespread in chronic kidney disease, data is scarce in the role Vitamin D may play in fractures in such cases. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all patients visiting Nephrology outpatients department in 1 UK District General Hospital over 2 years. Chronic kidney disease was categorised by estimated glomerular filtration rate, total Vitamin D and fracture details obtained from Hospital Information Technology system. Total Vitamin D &amp;lt;50 nmol/L was considered inadequate. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationships of eGFR and total Vitamin D with fracture incidence. Spearman&amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient (rs) was used to assess the relationship between continuous variables.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Peritoneal Dialysis nicely treated by active vitamin D</title><link>/posts/peritoneal-dialysis-nicely-treated-by-active-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/peritoneal-dialysis-nicely-treated-by-active-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="treatment-with-oral-active-vitamin-d-is-associated-with-decreased-risk-of-peritonitis-and-improved-survival-in-patients-on-peritoneal-dialysis">Treatment with Oral Active Vitamin D Is Associated with Decreased Risk of Peritonitis and Improved Survival in Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) being associated with hospitalization, catheter loss, technique failure, and increased mortality. Data on incidence rates and risk factors for peritonitis episodes vary between centers. In seven Austrian PD units clinical and laboratory data on each peritonitis episode were collected from all patients (n = 726) who performed PD between January 2000 and December 2009. The peritonitis incidence rate was 0.32 episodes/patient-year. In a multivariate analysis the risk of peritonitis was decreased by 57% in patients treated with oral active vitamin D (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.28–0.64). Renal disease classified as “other or unknown” (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.08–2.53) and serum albumin &amp;lt;3500 mg/dl (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.04–2.15) were also associated with an increased risk of peritonitis. Albumin levels &amp;lt;3500 mg/dl (HR 1.89; 95% CI 1.13–3.17), age (HR 1.06 per year; 95% CI 1.03–1.09), and cardiomyopathy (HR 3.01; 95% CI 1.62–5.59) were associated with increased mortality, whereas treatment with oral active vitamin D was associated with a significantly lower risk of death (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27–0.81). In this retrospective multi-center study we identified several factors being related to increased risk of peritonitis in PD patients. Treatment with oral active vitamin D was identified as being independently associated with decreased risk of peritonitis, and decreased all-cause mortality in PD patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>25,0000 IU vitamin D weekly only raised 60 percent on hemodialysis above 30 ng</title><link>/posts/250000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-only-raised-60-percent-on-hemodialysis-above-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/250000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-only-raised-60-percent-on-hemodialysis-above-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="biochemical-parameters-after-cholecalciferol-repletion-in-hemodialysis-results-from-the-vitadial-randomized-trial">Biochemical parameters after cholecalciferol repletion in hemodialysis: results From the VitaDial randomized trial.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major public health problem whose prevalence has been increasing in recent years. It is characterized by a progressive pattern and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Several factors are associated with the onset and progression of DN, such as glycaemic control, hypertension, obesity and inflammation status. In addition, vitamin D also seems to be involved through a pleiotropic regulatory activity/protection with promising applicability, either in prevention or progression of renal disease. The purpose of this review was to summarize the scientific evidence that supports the role of vitamin D in diabetes mellitus and DN.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UVB increases vitamin D even if poor kidney by changing CYP27B1 genes in skin</title><link>/posts/uvb-increases-vitamin-d-even-if-poor-kidney-by-changing-cyp27b1-genes-in-skin.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/uvb-increases-vitamin-d-even-if-poor-kidney-by-changing-cyp27b1-genes-in-skin.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="a-narrow-band-ultraviolet-b-course-improves-vitamin-d-balance-and-alters-cutaneous-cyp27a1-and-cyp27b1-mrna-expression-levels-in-haemodialysis-patients-supplemented-with-oral-vitamin-d">A narrow-band ultraviolet B course improves vitamin D balance and alters cutaneous CYP27A1 and CYP27B1 mRNA expression levels in haemodialysis patients supplemented with oral vitamin D.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a significant global health problem because of the increased risk of total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is common in patients with CKD, and serum levels of vitamin D appear to have an inverse correlation with kidney function. Growing evidence has indicated that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to deteriorating renal function, as well as increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Recent studies have suggested that treatment with active vitamin D or its analogues can ameliorate renal injury by reducing fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation in animal models; this treatment also decreases proteinuria and mortality in patients with CKD. These renoprotective effects of vitamin D treatment are far beyond its classical role in the maintenance of bone and mineral metabolism, in addition to its pleiotropic effects on extra-mineral metabolism. In this review, we discuss the altered metabolism of vitamin D in kidney disease, and the potential renoprotective mechanisms of vitamin D in experimental and clinical studies.

However, increasing numbers of studies have established that vitamin D insufficiency contributes to a number of diseases, suggesting a range of physiological functions of vitamin D.M Several clinical studies have confirmed that vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating innate immune responses toward various pathogens.5 Moreover, recent studies indicate that vitamin D can regulate the adaptive immune response in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.6,7 These results suggest the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in decreasing the risk and adverse outcomes of inflammatory diseases, although the precise effect remains to be elucidated in large clinical trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney Inflammation: both prevented and reduced by Vitamin D – review</title><link>/posts/kidney-inflammation-both-prevented-and-reduced-by-vitamin-d-review.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-inflammation-both-prevented-and-reduced-by-vitamin-d-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-the-immune-system-from-the-nephrologists-viewpoint">Vitamin D and the Immune System from the Nephrologist&amp;rsquo;s Viewpoint&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We aimed to explore the association between vitamin D levels and the severity, mortality and microbiological etiology of community-acquired pneumonia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D levels (both, the reservoir form 25-OH and the activated form 1,25-OH2) of 300 randomly selected patients with community-acquired pneumonia due to pre-specified pathogens included in the German competence network (CAPNETZ) study were measured. Prior to statistical analysis, values of 25-OH and 1,25-OH2 were power-transformed to achieve parametric distribution. All further analyses were performed with seasonally and age adjusted values.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>4X more Chronic Kidney disease patients are now using vitamin D</title><link>/posts/4x-more-chronic-kidney-disease-patients-are-now-using-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/4x-more-chronic-kidney-disease-patients-are-now-using-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="kidney-disease-patient-use-of-vitamin-d-supplements-risinghttpwwwrenalandurologynewscomkidney-disease-patient-use-of-vitamin-d-supplements-risingarticle33826320-renal-and-urology-news">&lt;a href="http://www.renalandurologynews.com/kidney-disease-patient-use-of-vitamin-d-supplements-rising/article/338263/%20">Kidney Disease Patient Use of Vitamin D Supplements Rising&lt;/a> Renal and Urology News&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), management of diet is important in prevention of disease progression and symptom management, however evidence on nutrition prescription is limited. Recent international CKD guidelines and literature was reviewed to address the following question &amp;ldquo;What is the appropriate nutrition prescription to achieve positive outcomes in adult patients with chronic kidney disease?&amp;rdquo; Databases included in the search were Medline and CINAHL using EBSCOhost search engine, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published from 2000 to 2009. International guidelines pertaining to nutrition prescription in CKD were also reviewed from 2000 to 2013. Three hundred and eleven papers and eight guidelines were reviewed by three reviewers. Evidence was graded as per the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia criteria. The evidence from thirty six papers was tabulated under the following headings: protein, weight loss, enteral support, vitamin D, sodium, fat, fibre, oral nutrition supplements, nutrition counselling, including protein and phosphate, nutrients in peritoneal dialysis solution and intradialytic parenteral nutrition, and was compared to international guidelines. While more evidence based studies are warranted, the customary nutrition prescription remains satisfactory with the exception of Vitamin D and phosphate. In these two areas, additional research is urgently needed given the potential of adverse outcomes for the CKD patient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney not essential for Vitamin D3 activation – fungi can do it</title><link>/posts/kidney-not-essential-for-vitamin-d3-activation-fungi-can-do-it.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-not-essential-for-vitamin-d3-activation-fungi-can-do-it.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="microbial-production-of-1α-hydroxyvitamin-d3-from-vitamin-d3">Microbial production of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 from vitamin D3.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The microbial transformation of vitamin D3 (1) by the fungi Candida maltosa R42 and Botrytis allii NRRL 2502 was investigated. Incubation of compound 1 with C. maltosa R42 and B. allii NRRL 2502 produced the same three more polar metabolites in small yields. The main metabolite was identified as 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (2). This biotransformation has utility as a possible tool for the production of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 from the readily available vitamin D3 for patients with compromised kidney function.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most Chronic Kidney Disease patients restored their vitamin D levels with just 1,000 IU</title><link>/posts/most-chronic-kidney-disease-patients-restored-their-vitamin-d-levels-with-just-1000-iu.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/most-chronic-kidney-disease-patients-restored-their-vitamin-d-levels-with-just-1000-iu.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="prevalence-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-effects-of-supplementation-with-cholecalciferol-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease">Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency and Effects of Supplementation With Cholecalciferol in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>In patients with kidney disease receiving hemodialysis, metabolic acidosis is closely tied to muscle pathology and is known to exacerbate age-related loss of muscle mass and function. To a lesser extent, the &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; diet is thought to contribute to mild (sub-clinical) metabolic acidosis via the supply of acid precursors from foods &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>, but the clinical significance to chronic age-related muscle degeneration has received little attention. This may partly be due to equivocal data on the benefits of neutralizing diet-induced metabolic acidosis for improving muscle-related outcomes in patients without kidney disease &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>. Despite limited data, acidosis has been shown to stimulate muscle proteolysis and is associated with negative functional outcomes including reduced peak torque and lower gait speed &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>. This is important to note because aged adults are less able to excrete excess H? ions and are more prone to develop mild, but slowly increasing metabolic acidosis that may be exacerbated by a &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; diet &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. Furthermore, approximately one out of four adults older than 50 years of age have low serum bicarbonate levels to neutralize an acidogenic diet.

&lt;p>Abstract&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Numerous drugs with vitamin D activity are available for clinical use and it may not be easy for the non-specialist to select the most suitable for the individual patient. In this paper we review the main characteristics of the available drugs and provide evidence about any potential specific clinical indications, with special emphasis on renal patients, in order to facilitate the optimal choice. Natural vitamin D products (i.e. those identical to natural metabolites) are first examined, followed by the most frequently used synthetic molecules (i.e. bioengineered molecules not-existing in nature), which are generally indicated as &amp;ldquo;analogs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D tester falsely said half of hemodialysis patients had less than 30 ng</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-tester-falsely-said-half-of-hemodialysis-patients-had-less-than-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-tester-falsely-said-half-of-hemodialysis-patients-had-less-than-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="accuracy-of-three-automated-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-assays-in-hemodialysis-patients">Accuracy of three automated 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays in hemodialysis patients.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an emerging public health problem and one of the most powerful predictors of premature cardiovascular disease. Emerging evidence suggests that the progression of CKD and many of the cardiovascular complications may be linked to hypovitaminosis D. Patients with CKD have an exceptionally high rate of severe vitamin D deficiency that is further exacerbated by the reduced ability to convert 25-(OH)vitamin D into the active form, 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D. As new evidence has improved our understanding of classical, as well as the nonclassical, functions for vitamin D, it has become apparent that the autocrine role of vitamin D is an important modulator of several systems including the immune, renal and cardiovascular systems. In addition to the traditional supplementation of 1,25-vitamin D to CKD patients, by assessing and repleting 25-(OH)vitamin D deficiency, physicians will adequately fuel both the renal and extra-renal pathways of calcitriol synthesis maintaining the classical, as well as the non-classical, functions of vitamin D that ultimately influence clinical outcomes in this high-risk group of patients. Because of the high rates of hypovitaminosis D and progression of CKD to end-stage renal disease in minority populations, these findings are highly relevant to the national efforts to reduce health disparities. Healthcare providers are called to join the intensified efforts of public health officials to disseminate and implement updated guidelines and recommendations to halt the growing epidemic of vitamin D deficiency, particularly in high-risk populations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2000 IU vitamin D3 was not enough for children with chronic kidney disease</title><link>/posts/2000-iu-vitamin-d3-was-not-enough-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2000-iu-vitamin-d3-was-not-enough-for-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-treatment-with-oral-vitamin-d3-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease">Vitamin D insufficiency and treatment with oral vitamin D3 in children with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Vitamin D compounds may have extraskeletal functions. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) offers an opportunity to investigate these actions, as vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in this population and actions of vitamin D such as those on the heart and glucose metabolism are highly relevant. However, recent randomized controlled trials have tempered enthusiasm. We appraise a trial by de Boer et al. that addresses effects of paricalcitol on glucose metabolism in CKD, and offer perspectives on future trials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>For those with kidney disease, diabetes is strongly associated with low vitamin D – 2012</title><link>/posts/for-those-with-kidney-disease-diabetes-is-strongly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-2012.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/for-those-with-kidney-disease-diabetes-is-strongly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="risk-factors-for-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease">Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In the United States, there are significant racial disparities in the incidence and prevalence of end-stage renal disease. The disparities are greatest for the Blacks and the magnitude of disparity is significantly greater than is evident from the incidence and prevalence data of end-stage renal disease - early stage chronic kidney disease is less common in Blacks and during that stage, mortality rate is significantly higher for that racial group. Recent studies have identified a genetic predisposition for non-diabetic renal disease among Blacks. However, genetic factors explain only part of the higher risk and the racial disparities are a result of a complex interplay of biology and sociology. Herein we focus on two factors and their role in explaining the higher risk for progression of chronic kidney disease among Blacks - one biologic (vitamin D deficiency) and one sociologic (neighborhood poverty). A greater Understanding of these factors is important in order to reduce the racial disparities in the United States.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney transplant patients advised to avoid the sun, then 90% have very low vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/kidney-transplant-patients-advised-to-avoid-the-sun-then-90-percent-have-very-low-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-transplant-patients-advised-to-avoid-the-sun-then-90-percent-have-very-low-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="preserved-circannual-rhythm-of-vitamin-d-in-kidney-transplant-patients">Preserved circannual rhythm of vitamin D in kidney transplant patients.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency has been found in the general population, in patients with chronic kidney disease and in kidney transplant patients. During winter there is a higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency due to the lack of solar ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure. Kidney transplant patients are advised to avoid sun exposure because of their high risk of skin cancer. This is considered to be one of the main reasons for the very high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in these patients. Whether circannual rhythm of vitamin D is totally reversed in kidney transplant patients is not known.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rosuvastatin given for renal problem resulted in increased vitamin D levels – RCT</title><link>/posts/rosuvastatin-given-for-renal-problem-resulted-in-increased-vitamin-d-levels-rct.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rosuvastatin-given-for-renal-problem-resulted-in-increased-vitamin-d-levels-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="25-hydroxyvitamin-d-insufficiency-is-associated-with-impaired-renal-endothelial-function-and-both-are-improved-with-rosuvastatin-treatment">25-Hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency is associated with impaired renal endothelial function and both are improved with rosuvastatin treatment.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is gaining increasing medical and economical importance, but little information exists about treatment variation and the impact of routine clinical treatments on survival, quality of life, and cost. We demonstrate the first results of a national electronic registry of nephrology clinic data that will serve as a resource for the prospective observation of CKD patients in Germany. A large network of German nephrologist practices is currently joining the project. Routinely obtained clinical data for non-dialysis dependent CKD patients are documented in health records electronically, and elements from these data are extracted using QuaNT (Qualitätssicherung Nephrologie und Transplantation) to create a centralized database. Here, we report cross-sectional data from 59 participating nephrology clinics and 6,187 patients with CKD Stage 3 - 5 in 2011. Mean age ± standard deviation (SD) was 72 ± 12 years. The distribution of CKD 3, 4, and 5 (non-dialysis) was 60%, 33%, and 8%, respectively. The major renal diseases were hypertension/vascular nephropathy (47%) and diabetic nephropathy (26%).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Active vitamin D treats Chronic Kidney Disease by stimulating Klotho production</title><link>/posts/active-vitamin-d-treats-chronic-kidney-disease-by-stimulating-klotho-production.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/active-vitamin-d-treats-chronic-kidney-disease-by-stimulating-klotho-production.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-secreted-klotho-a-long-awaited-panacea-for-vascular-calcification">Vitamin D and secreted Klotho: a long-awaited panacea for vascular calcification?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by accelerated vascular calcification, which may in part be caused by deficiency of the anti-aging factor Klotho. Lau et al. demonstrate that administration of active vitamin D and its analog decreases aortic calcification in association with increases in two potent calcification inhibitors—the secreted form of Klotho and vascular osteopontin. These data might provide a new perspective on the association of active vitamin D with improved survival in patients with CKD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Poor kidneys result in lower vitamin D level result in 7X more tooth loss</title><link>/posts/poor-kidneys-result-in-lower-vitamin-d-level-result-in-7x-more-tooth-loss.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/poor-kidneys-result-in-lower-vitamin-d-level-result-in-7x-more-tooth-loss.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="association-between-low-renal-function-and-tooth-loss-over-5-years">Association between low renal function and tooth loss over 5 years.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>MATERIAL AND METHODS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Subjects comprised 406 female subjects (55-74 years old) who agreed to participate in a baseline examination and a follow-up examination after 5 years. Serum cystatin C levels were used to assess renal function. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between tooth loss and change in serum cystatin C levels over 5 years. Tooth loss over 5 years (0: no, 1: yes) was used as the dependent variable. Seven variables were used as independent variables, including change in serum cystatin C levels over 5 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When lupus affects the kidneys vitamin D levels drop even further</title><link>/posts/when-lupus-affects-the-kidneys-vitamin-d-levels-drop-even-further.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/when-lupus-affects-the-kidneys-vitamin-d-levels-drop-even-further.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-predictive-factors-of-low-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-patients-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus">The predictive factors of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin D deficiency in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is a steroid hormone with pleiotropic effects. The association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level &lt;span>[25(OH) D]&lt;/span> and lupus nephritis are not clearly known. We aim to determine serum 25(OH) D levels in patients with inactive SLE, active SLE without lupus nephritis (LN) and active SLE with LN and to identify clinical predictor of vitamin D deficiency. One hundred and eight SLE patients were included. Patients were classified as Group (Gr) 1, 2 and 3 if they had SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) &amp;lt;3, ≥3 but no LN and ≥3 with LN. Important baseline characteristics were collected. 25(OH) D was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). SLEDAI in Gr1, Gr2 and Gr3 was 0.7 (0.9), 5.6 (2.3) and 9.2 (5.2), respectively. 43.5 % had vitamin D insufficiency and 29.6 % had vitamin D deficiency. Mean 25(OH) D in each groups was 28.3 (8.0), 26.7 (9.5) and 19.9 (7.6) ng/ml (p &amp;lt; 0.001 comparing Gr1 and 3) (p = 0.003 comparing Gr2 and 3). Vitamin D deficiency was found in 11.1, 22.2 and 55.6 % of Gr1, 2 and 3. Linear regression analysis found that 25(OH) D was significantly correlated with serum albumin (r = 0.28, p = 0.004), inversely correlated with SLEDAI (r = -0.22, p = 0.03) and urinary protein creatinine index (UPCI) (r = -0.28, p = 0.005), but not with sun exposure score, body mass index and estimated GFR. Only UPCI was significantly inversely correlated with 25(OH) D (p = 0.02) from multiple linear regression. LN was a significant predictor of vitamin D deficiency from multivariate logistic regression (OR &lt;strong>5.97&lt;/strong> ; p = 0.006). Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was found in 93 and 86 % of LN with proteinuria ≥ and &amp;lt;500 mg/day. We conclude that SLE patients with LN have significantly lower vitamin D level than inactive SLE and active SLE without LN. Hence, nephritis is a significant predictor of vitamin D deficiency in SLE patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CYP24A1 gene, kidney disease, and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/cyp24a1-gene-kidney-disease-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cyp24a1-gene-kidney-disease-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="cyp24a1-and-kidney-disease">CYP24A1 and kidney disease&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patients with chronic renal disease have elevated serum phosphate levels, elevated fibroblast-like growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and declining vitamin D status. These changes are related and may be responsible for elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) and dysfunctional vitamin D metabolism. This review focuses on the biochemistry and pathophysiology of CYP24A1 and the utility of blocking this enzyme with CYP24A1 inhibitors in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D3 far better than D2 for hemodialysis</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d3-far-better-than-d2-for-hemodialysis.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d3-far-better-than-d2-for-hemodialysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d2-versus-vitamin-d3-supplementation-in-hemodialysis-patients">Vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3 supplementation in hemodialysis patients:&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Background: In patients with chronic kidney disease, vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent. It can be corrected by supplementation with either vitamin D2 or vitamin D3. Recent studies in patients without impaired kidney function suggest that vitamin D3 is more efficient than vitamin D2 in correcting vitamin D insufficiency. However, no direct comparison has been made in hemodialysis (HD) patients.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney – only 1 in 3 doctors said kids need more than 30 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/chronic-kidney-only-1-in-3-doctors-said-kids-need-more-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chronic-kidney-only-1-in-3-doctors-said-kids-need-more-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kidney Dialysis clinics reluctant to add vitamin D treatment as they are not reimbursed</title><link>/posts/kidney-dialysis-clinics-reluctant-to-add-vitamin-d-treatment-as-they-are-not-reimbursed.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-dialysis-clinics-reluctant-to-add-vitamin-d-treatment-as-they-are-not-reimbursed.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>And, treating with vitamin D would decrease their number of patients thus and their income&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>INTRODUCTION:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiencies are well described in general populations and in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although serum 25(OH)D may be a good indicator of vitamin D status in healthy individuals, the hydroxylated product, 1,25(OH)(2)D, essential for important biological functions such as mineral metabolism, bone turnover, regulation of protein synthesis, cell differentiation and proliferation may be a more suitable indicator for individuals with CKD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7100 IU (50000 weekly) restored vitamin D levels for those with Chronic Kidney Disease</title><link>/posts/7100-iu-50000-weekly-restored-vitamin-d-levels-for-those-with-chronic-kidney-disease.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/7100-iu-50000-weekly-restored-vitamin-d-levels-for-those-with-chronic-kidney-disease.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="cholecalciferol-supplementation-in-chronic-kidney-disease-restoration-of-vitamin-d-status-and-impact-on-parathyroid-hormone">Cholecalciferol Supplementation in Chronic Kidney Disease: Restoration of Vitamin D Status and Impact on Parathyroid Hormone&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by a progressive decrease in the ability to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Pharmacological replacement with active vitamin D therefore has been a cornerstone of secondary hyperparathyroidism therapy in the end-stage renal disease population treated by long-term dialysis. Recent evidence suggests that extrarenal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may have significant biological roles beyond those traditionally ascribed to vitamin D. Furthermore, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are common in patients with all stages of CKD. This article focuses on the role of nutritional vitamin D replacement in CKD and aims to review vitamin D biology and summarize the existing literature regarding nutritional vitamin D replacement in these populations. Based on the current state of the evidence, we provide suggestions for clinical practice and address areas of uncertainty that need further research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D testing typically not needed, but in 9 cases it is</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-testing-typically-not-needed-but-in-9-cases-it-is.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-testing-typically-not-needed-but-in-9-cases-it-is.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="see-also-vitamindwiki">See also VitaminDWiki&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Objective We conducted a cohort study to identify the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in predialyzed patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods An observational study of 135 outpatients with stage 3-5 CKD was undertaken. Clinical and biochemical parameters were analyzed in terms of nutritional status, inflammation, and mineral metabolism in relation to serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fructose reduces blood levels of active vitamin D</title><link>/posts/fructose-reduces-blood-levels-of-active-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fructose-reduces-blood-levels-of-active-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Excessive fructose consumption inhibits adaptive increases in intestinal Ca2+ transport in lactating and weanling rats with increased Ca2+ requirements by preventing the increase in serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3.

&lt;p>The aging process affects all organs, including the kidneys. As part of this process, progressive scarring and a measurable decline in renal function occur in most people over time. The improved understanding of the processes that can lead to and/or hasten scarring and loss of renal function over time parallels advances in our understanding of the aging process. Clinical factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, abnormal lipid levels and vitamin D deficiency, have been associated with increasing renal sclerosis with age. In addition, tissue factors such as angiotensin II, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress and Klotho are associated with renal aging. These associations and possible interventions, including the control of blood pressure, blood sugar, weight, diet and calorie restriction might make renal aging more preventable than inevitable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2.8X more likely to die of hemodialysis if low on vitamin D</title><link>/posts/28x-more-likely-to-die-of-hemodialysis-if-low-on-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/28x-more-likely-to-die-of-hemodialysis-if-low-on-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Background:Vitamin D deficiency and protein-energy wasting (PEW) are highly prevalent in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The goal of our study was to investigate if a lack of vitamin D influences mortality and hospitalization of HD patients with or without PEW. Methods: In 81 chronic HD patients with different nutritional status assessed by the Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), vitamin D deficiency (25-OH-vitamin D(3) levels ?30 nmol/l or &lt;strong>?12 ng/ml&lt;/strong> ) was prospectively investigated for its prognostic impact on mortality and hospitalization. Over a 3-year follow-up, all-cause mortality and hospitalization were determined. The predictive value of low vitamin D levels and PEW as well as their combined effect were evaluated using a multivariate Cox regression model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>33 percent more likely to die of chronic kidney disease if less than 15 ng vitamin D</title><link>/posts/33-percent-more-likely-to-die-of-chronic-kidney-disease-if-less-than-15-ng-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/33-percent-more-likely-to-die-of-chronic-kidney-disease-if-less-than-15-ng-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>People with kidney disease moved faster after adding vitamin D</title><link>/posts/people-with-kidney-disease-moved-faster-after-adding-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/people-with-kidney-disease-moved-faster-after-adding-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Introduction: Vitamin D deficiencies are well described in general populations and in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although serum 25(OH)D may be a good indicator of vitamin D status in healthy individuals, &lt;strong>the hydroxylated product, 1,25(OH)2D,&lt;/strong> essential for important biological functions such as mineral metabolism, bone turnover, regulation of protein synthesis, cell differentiation and proliferation may be a more suitable indicator for individuals with CKD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyclosporine etc. probably increase the need for vitamin D</title><link>/posts/cyclosporine-etc-probably-increase-the-need-for-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cyclosporine-etc-probably-increase-the-need-for-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency, assessed as low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) level, is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with various adverse health outcomes.

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is common in adult renal transplant recipients, but data in children are scarce. Vitamin D is shown to have multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, renal function, and maintenance of bone health. We hypothesized that 25(OH)D deficiency is common in pediatric renal transplant recipients, and may be associated with hyperparathyroidism, short stature, renal function, and blood pressure control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dialysis patients with higher levels of vitamin D were better</title><link>/posts/dialysis-patients-with-higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-were-better.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dialysis-patients-with-higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-were-better.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="25-hydroxyvitamin-d-concentration-is-inversely-associated-with-serum-mmp-9-in-a-cross-sectional-study-of-african-american-esrd-patients">25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration is Inversely Associated with Serum MMP-9 in a cross-sectional study of African American ESRD Patients.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The underlying pathophysiology of this association remains largely unexplained and there is currently no clear interventional pathway. Emphasis has been placed on measuring serum levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH) to monitor disease progression, driven by the assumption that achieving values within the &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; range will translate into improved outcomes. Retrospective studies have provided a body of evidence that abnormal levels of mineral biomarkers, and phosphate in particular, are associated with clinical events. Disturbances in vitamin D metabolism are also likely to contribute to the pathophysiology of CKD. Designing studies that yield useful information has proved to be difficult, partly owing to conceptual and financial limitations, but also because of the tight interdependency of calcium, phosphate and PTH, and the potential impact of vitamin D on these mineral metabolites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dialysis patients with less than 15 ng of vitamin D did not feel well</title><link>/posts/dialysis-patients-with-less-than-15-ng-of-vitamin-d-did-not-feel-well.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dialysis-patients-with-less-than-15-ng-of-vitamin-d-did-not-feel-well.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Heart problems 5X worse for chronic kidney patients low on vitamin D</title><link>/posts/heart-problems-5x-worse-for-chronic-kidney-patients-low-on-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/heart-problems-5x-worse-for-chronic-kidney-patients-low-on-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wearable dialysis device being tested which also converts vitamin D</title><link>/posts/wearable-dialysis-device-being-tested-which-also-converts-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wearable-dialysis-device-being-tested-which-also-converts-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="being-developed-march-2011">Being Developed March 2011&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Background. The majority of dialysis patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency, which might contribute to an adverse health outcome. We aimed to elucidate whether European dialysis patients with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are at increased risk of mortality and specific fatal events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods. This was a prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients in the Netherlands (the NECOSAD). We selected all patients with measured 25(OH)D at 12 months after the start of dialysis, the baseline for our study. By Cox regression analyses, we assessed the impact of 25(OH)D levels on short-term (6 months of follow-up) as well as longer-term mortality (3 years of follow-up). Associations of 25(OH)D levels with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality were also determined.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney failure and vitamin D deficiency vicious cycle</title><link>/posts/kidney-failure-and-vitamin-d-deficiency-vicious-cycle.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-failure-and-vitamin-d-deficiency-vicious-cycle.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="defective-renal-maintenance-of-the-vitamin-d-endocrine-system-impairs-vitamin-d-renoprotection-a-downward-spiral-in-kidney-disease">Defective renal maintenance of the vitamin D endocrine system impairs vitamin D renoprotection: a downward spiral in kidney disease.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In kidney disease, the progressive loss of renal capacity to produce calcitriol, the vitamin D hormone, is a key contributor to elevations in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mineral and skeletal disorders predisposing to renal and cardiovascular damage, ectopic calcifications, and high mortality rates. Thus, the safe correction of calcitriol deficiency to suppress PTH has been the treatment of choice for decades. However, recent epidemiological and experimental data suggest that calcitriol replacement may improve outcomes through renal and cardioprotective actions unrelated to PTH suppression. Furthermore, a striking incidence of vitamin D deficiency occurs in kidney disease and associates more strongly than calcitriol deficiency with a higher risk for kidney disease progression and death. Despite the translational relevance of these findings, no prospective trials are currently available in support of the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation and/or calcitriol replacement to safely halt/moderate renal disease progression.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney Disease meta-analysis of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-meta-analysis-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-meta-analysis-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-in-chronic-kidney-disease-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-and-randomized-controlled-trials">Vitamin D Supplementation in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The understanding of vitamin D&amp;rsquo;s role in human health has recently expanded. It is now recognized as more than a hormone activated in the kidney only for calcium homeostasis. It is metabolized and used by virtually every cell in the body. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a deficit in their kidney production of 1,25(OH)(2)D and have classically been treated with calcitriol or its active analogues. Despite often having lower systemic levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D, patients with chronic kidney disease retain the capability of extra renal production of 1,25(OH)(2)D. This has far reaching implications for their health. This review examines clinical trials and observations in 3 areas that impact chronic kidney disease patients. Cancer, cardiovascular disease and infections are responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. We will discuss vitamin D&amp;rsquo;s role in these disease states with a focus on the chronic kidney disease patient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency</title><link>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-and-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/chronic-kidney-disease-and-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-biology-from-the-discovery-to-its-significance-in-chronic-kidney-disease">Vitamin d biology: from the discovery to its significance in chronic kidney disease.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D was discovered and had its chemical structure described in the early years of the last century. Although classified as a nutrient because it was found in small quantities in butter, it soon became clear that exposure of skin to sunlight, supplies most of the vitamin D necessary for good health in human beings. Vitamin D (D3 or cholecalciferol) synthesis in the skin is extremely rapid and remarkably robust despite the complexity of the mechanisms involved. However, a number of factors related to latitude location, season, and skin characteristics can interfere with the photoproduction of vitamin D. The 2 forms of vitamin D (D3 or D2-ergocalciferol) are biologically inactive and require activation in the liver and kidney. The product of the first hydroxylation of vitamin D in the liver, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), is the marker of vitamin D status. Hypovitaminosis D (serum 25(OH)D, &amp;lt;30 ng/mL) is highly prevalent in the general population, and patients with chronic kidney disease seem to be at higher risk for the development of hypovitaminosis D. It is believed that, besides the traditional factors, protein losses, gastrointestinal malabsorption, and &lt;strong>defective skin synthesis&lt;/strong> of vitamin D might contribute to the elevated number of patients with suboptimal level of vitamin D status.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D helps organ transplant - many studies</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-helps-organ-transplant-many-studies.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-helps-organ-transplant-many-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The fat-soluble secosteroid hormone vitamin D is best known for its role in bone metabolism. From a historical perspective, the study of vitamin D deficiency has been intimately related to the study of (possible treatment of) rickets. Although diseases characterized by bone deformations have been described in ancient medical writings from the 1st and 2nd centuries, it was Galen who described the classic bone deformities noted in rickets &lt;sup>[1, 2]&lt;/sup>. More clear descriptions originate from the 17th century, reporting rickets to be endemic in England &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. In the early 20th century, observations that artificial UV light or sunlight provides protection against rickets coincided with results suggesting that rickets may be the consequence of a nutritional deficiency &lt;sup>[3, 4]&lt;/sup>. The responsible vitamin was identified by McCollum et al., who stated in their paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 1922: “These experiments clearly demonstrate the existence of a fourth vitamin whose specific property, as far as we can tell at present, is to regulate the metabolism of the bones” &lt;sup>[5]&lt;/sup>.

&lt;p>Black individuals have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> levels and experience a disproportionate burden of ESRD compared with white individuals. Animal studies suggest that vitamin D has renoprotective effects. We evaluated the contribution of low 25(OH)D levels on incidence of ESRD using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-linked Medicare claims files (n = 13,328). We included baseline (1988 through 1994) measurements of 25(OH)D and assessed the incidence of ESRD through July 31, 2001.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta-analysis finds vitamin D helps chronic kidney disease</title><link>/posts/meta-analysis-finds-vitamin-d-helps-chronic-kidney-disease.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/meta-analysis-finds-vitamin-d-helps-chronic-kidney-disease.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-in-chronic-kidney-disease-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-and-randomized-controlled-trials">Vitamin D Supplementation in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Abstract Both vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D toxicity are associated with cardiovascular complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical and experiment data indicate that the association of vitamin D levels with cardiovascular disease is best illustrated as a biphasic, or U–shaped, curve. Children and adolescents with CKD need vitamin D due to the demands of a growing skeleton, to prevent renal rickets. However, this therapy carries the risk of severe side effects and chronic toxicity. Observational studies show that vitamin D deficiency and toxicity are frequently present in patients with CKD. In view of the importance of cardiovascular complications for the long-term survival of young patients, these findings demand a judicious use of vitamin D preparations. In clinical practice, the therapeutic window is rather small, presenting a therapeutic challenge to avoid both vitamin D deficiency and toxicity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overview Kidney and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/overview-kidney-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/overview-kidney-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="incidence-of-chronic-kidney-disease---us">Incidence of Chronic Kidney Disease - US&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as a significant public health problem, with 20 million Americans, or 11% of the adult population, currently living with CKD. Life expectancy in patients with CKD is limited by the development of disturbances of mineral metabolism, which occurs in virtually all patients during the progression of their disease, and is associated with bone loss and fractures, cardiovascular disease, immune suppression, and increased mortality. As kidney disease develops, there is decreased functional renal mass and a reduction in renal 1alpha-hydroxylase activity and thus in renal production of calcitriol at very early CKD stages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Virtually all black dialysis patients with low albumin are vitamin D deficient in the winter</title><link>/posts/virtually-all-black-dialysis-patients-with-low-albumin-are-vitamin-d-deficient-in-the-winter.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/virtually-all-black-dialysis-patients-with-low-albumin-are-vitamin-d-deficient-in-the-winter.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="editorial-followed-by-abstract-of-the-article">Editorial followed by abstract of the article&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>People with reduced kidney function (chronic kidney disease; CKD) develop changes in circulating blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. The kidney gradually loses the ability to remove phosphorus from the blood and cannot activate adequate amounts of vitamin D, to maintain normal levels of calcium. The parathyroid gland senses these changes and compensates to increase calcium by elevating production and release of parathyroid hormone. These metabolic changes alter bone metabolism to release calcium and accordingly lead to bone abnormalities including altered bone production. Consequently bone deformation, bone pain, and altered risks of fracture may occur.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>D3 increased blood levels but doxercalciferol (an artificial D3) did not</title><link>/posts/d3-increased-blood-levels-but-doxercalciferol-an-artificial-d3-did-not.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/d3-increased-blood-levels-but-doxercalciferol-an-artificial-d3-did-not.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="a-randomized-trial-of-cholecalciferol-versus-doxercalciferol-for-lowering-parathyroid-hormone-in-chronic-kidney-disease">A randomized trial of cholecalciferol versus doxercalciferol for lowering parathyroid hormone in chronic kidney disease.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>VC (vascular calcification) is highly prevalent in patients with CKD (chronic kidney disease), but its mechanism is multifactorial and incompletely understood. In addition to increased traditional risk factors, CKD patients also have a number of non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors, which may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of arterial calcification, such as duration of dialysis and disorders of mineral metabolism. The transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into chondrocytes or osteoblast-like cells seems to be a key element in VC pathogenesis, in the context of passive calcium and phosphate deposition due to abnormal bone metabolism and impaired renal excretion. The process may be favoured by the low levels of circulating and locally produced VC inhibitors. VC determines increased arterial stiffness, left ventricular hypertrophy, a decrease in coronary artery perfusion, myocardial ischaemia and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Table of outcomes for seniors vs vitamin D level</title><link>/posts/table-of-outcomes-for-seniors-vs-vitamin-d-level.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/table-of-outcomes-for-seniors-vs-vitamin-d-level.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="stratifying-cardiovascular-risk-by-vitamin-d-levels-what-are-the-optimal-cutoffs">STRATIFYING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK BY VITAMIN D LEVELS: WHAT ARE THE OPTIMAL CUTOFFS?&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is common in healthy adults and children as well as in the **chronic kidney disease_ (CKD) population. What was once a disease of malnourished children in the developing world has re-emerged and reached pandemic proportions. In parallel with this development, there is a growing awareness that vitamin D is not simply a &amp;lsquo;calcaemic hormone&amp;rsquo; but plays an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, infectious and auto-immune conditions, renoprotection, glycaemic control and prevention of some common cancers. Most tissues in the body have a vitamin D receptor and the enzymatic machinery to convert &amp;rsquo;nutritional&amp;rsquo; 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; it is estimated that 3% of the human genome is regulated by the vitamin D endocrine system. Although there are few well-conducted studies on the benefits of vitamin D therapy, an exuberant use of vitamin D is now seen in the general population and at all stages of CKD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cannell Newsletter</title><link>/posts/cannell-newsletter.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cannell-newsletter.html</guid><description>&lt;p>More letters&lt;/p>
