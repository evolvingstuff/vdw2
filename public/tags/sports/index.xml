&lt;p>The purpose of the study was to assess the association of cartilage metabolism biomarkers and vitamin D metabolite levels with muscle biomechanical functions in professional rowers and canoeists. The serum levels of aggrecan, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were determined in elite male sweep-oar rowers (n = 24) and canoeists (n = 15). This was followed by a biomechanical study consisting in isometric measurement of peak torque (PT) of muscles involved in the rowing cycle in the athletes. There were found significant correlations of COMP with the ratio of trunk PT flexor to extensor (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and 25(OH)D with trunk PT-left rotators (p &amp;lt; 0.05), knee joints PT-left and right flexor (p ≤ 0.01), ratio of knee joint PT-right flexor to knee joint PT-right extensor (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in rowers and aggreccan with elbow joint PT of the right flexor (p ≤ 0.01) and extensor (p = 0.05) in canoeists. The correlations of COMP and aggrecan levels with PT of the muscle groups studied in rowers and canoeists indicate the importance of stabilizing the muscular system in cartilage metabolism. The relationship between 25(OH)D status and biomechanical parameters confirm that vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining skeletal muscle health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>16 Longevity books compared in a video</title><link>/posts/16-longevity-books-compared-in-a-video.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/16-longevity-books-compared-in-a-video.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Previous studies have suggested that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, predominantly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have several health benefits. However, their effect on changes in skeletal muscle mass and strength has not been established, owing to differences in study designs. This systematic review aimed to investigate the recent evidence regarding the role of dietary EPA and DHA in muscle mass changes and their association with muscle strength. Databases including PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for randomized controlled trials and single-arm interventions that investigated the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle mass, strength, and body composition in adults aged 18 years and older.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skeletal Muscles regenerated with Vitamin D supplementation – review</title><link>/posts/skeletal-muscles-regenerated-with-vitamin-d-supplementation-review.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/skeletal-muscles-regenerated-with-vitamin-d-supplementation-review.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency, prevalent worldwide, is linked to muscle weakness, sarcopenia, and falls. Muscle regeneration is a vital process that allows for skeletal muscle tissue maintenance and repair after injury. PubMed and Web of Science were used to search for studies published prior to May 2023. We assessed eligible studies that discussed the relationship between vitamin D, muscle regeneration in this review. Overall, the literature reports strong associations between vitamin D and skeletal myocyte size, and muscle regeneration. In vitro studies in skeletal muscle cells derived from mice and humans showed vitamin D played a role in regulating myoblast growth, size, and gene expression. Animal studies, primarily in mice, demonstrate vitamin D&amp;rsquo;s positive effects on skeletal muscle function, such as improved grip strength and endurance. These studies encompass vitamin D diet research, genetically modified models, and disease-related mouse models. Relatively few studies looked at muscle function after injury, but these also support a role for vitamin D in muscle recovery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Athletes who had been COVID infected had lower Vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/athletes-who-had-been-covid-infected-had-lower-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/athletes-who-had-been-covid-infected-had-lower-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D, its importance in different processes taking place in the human body, the effects of abnormal levels of this hormone, either too low or too high, and the need for supplementation have been extensively researched thus far. Variances in exposure to sunlight can cause vitamin D levels to fluctuate. Indoor activity can be a factor for these fluctuations and can lead to a decrease in vitamin D levels. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to identify whether indoor compared to outdoor training has a significant influence on vitamin D levels; we also performed subgroup analyses and multivariate meta-regression. The type of training has an impact on vitamin D levels that is influenced by multiple cofounders. In a subgroup analysis not considering cofounders, the mean serum vitamin D was 3.73 ng/mL higher in outdoor athletes, a difference which barely fails to achieve significance (p = 0.052, a total sample size of 5150).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Athletic deaths now 7 X higher than normal</title><link>/posts/athletic-deaths-now-7-x-higher-than-normal.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/athletic-deaths-now-7-x-higher-than-normal.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="1616-athlete-cardiac-arrests-serious-issues-1114-of-them-dead-since-covid-injection">1616 Athlete Cardiac Arrests, Serious Issues, 1114 of Them Dead, Since COVID Injection&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background. Vitamin D is involved in muscle health and function. This relationship may start from the earliest stages of life during pregnancy when fetal vitamin D relies on maternal vitamin D stores and sun exposure. Our objective was to determine whether there was an effect of the month of birth (MoB) on muscle mass and strength in older adults.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exercise-induced muscle damage fought when enough vitamin D used for long enough – review</title><link>/posts/exercise-induced-muscle-damage-fought-when-enough-vitamin-d-used-for-long-enough-review.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/exercise-induced-muscle-damage-fought-when-enough-vitamin-d-used-for-long-enough-review.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>10,000 IU Vitamin D raised basketball player levels (more than 50 ng need to improve performance)</title><link>/posts/10000-iu-vitamin-d-raised-basketball-player-levels-more-than-50-ng-need-to-improve-performance.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/10000-iu-vitamin-d-raised-basketball-player-levels-more-than-50-ng-need-to-improve-performance.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Background: Lower extremity stress fractures result in lost time from work and sport and incur costs in the military when they occur in service members. Hypovitaminosis D has been identified as key risk factor in these injuries. An estimated 33% to 90% of collegiate and professional athletes have deficient vitamin D levels. Other branches of the United States military have evaluated the risk factors for stress fractures during basic training, including vitamin D deficiency. To the best of our knowledge, a study evaluating the correlation between these injuries and vitamin D deficiency in US Navy recruits and a cost analysis of these injuries has not been performed. Cutbacks in military medical staffing mean more active-duty personnel are being deferred for care to civilian providers. Consequently, data that previously were only pertinent to military medical providers have now expanded to the nonmilitary medical community.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low Vitamin D 2X more likely in power-sport athletes</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-2x-more-likely-in-power-sport-athletes.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-2x-more-likely-in-power-sport-athletes.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency has become a widespread public health problem owing to its potential adverse health effects. Generally, the nutritional status of vitamin D depends on sunlight exposure and dietary or supplementary intake. However, recent studies have found that exercise can influence circulating 25(OH)D levels; although, the results have been inconclusive. In this review, we focused on the effect of exercise on circulating vitamin D metabolites and their possible mechanisms. We found that endurance exercise can significantly increase serum 25(OH)D levels in vitamin D-deficient people but has no significant effect on vitamin D-sufficient people. This benefit has not been observed with resistance training. Only chronic endurance exercise training can significantly increase serum 1,25(OH)2D, and the effect may be sex-dependent. Exercise may influence 25(OH)D levels in the circulation by regulating either the vitamin D metabolites stored in tissues or the utilization by target tissues. The effects of exercise on 25(OH)D levels in the circulation may be dependent on many factors, such as the vitamin D nutritional status, exercise type and intensity, and sex. Therefore, further research on the effects and mechanisms of exercise on vitamin D metabolites is required.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diabetic inflammation synergistically decreased by Vitamin D and exercise – RCT</title><link>/posts/diabetic-inflammation-synergistically-decreased-by-vitamin-d-and-exercise-rct.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/diabetic-inflammation-synergistically-decreased-by-vitamin-d-and-exercise-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Magnesium and vitamin D are two micronutrients that contribute directly to the metabolism of macronutrients, maintenance of muscle function, and various metabolic processes (i.e., protein synthesis and bone metabolism). Dietary recommendations are established based on age and gender differences; however, energy expenditure is not accounted for in determining these values. It is believed that athletes may require greater nutrient quantities than less active populations because of their increased energy expenditure. Nutrient intake values have yet to be determined for athletes, leading to inadequate energy intake, deficiencies, and insufficiencies; thus, supplementation may be an effective way of achieving nutrient adequacy in athletes. The purpose of this narrative review was to present research pertaining to magnesium supplementation and vitamin D supplementation on exercise performance. A systematic keyword search for articles from PubMed was conducted from June to August 2020. The search terms included various words related to the topic. Inclusion criteria required articles to be available in English; to be a clinical trial, randomized controlled trial, or longitudinal study; and to involve magnesium supplementation, vitamin D supplementation, or supplementation of both micronutrients. In addition, the research conducted on magnesium or vitamin D were required to focus on athletes or those who exercised regularly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High-Dose Vitamin D puts surplus calories into muscles instead of fat (mice)</title><link>/posts/high-dose-vitamin-d-puts-surplus-calories-into-muscles-instead-of-fat-mice.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/high-dose-vitamin-d-puts-surplus-calories-into-muscles-instead-of-fat-mice.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are prevalent sport-related injuries that result in protracted quadriceps atrophy and weakness despite surgical reconstruction and physical therapy. Vitamin D and its receptor are integral for skeletal muscle development and homeostasis. In addition, vitamin D status is positively associated with muscle size and strength. If the vitamin D receptor and related enzymes are upregulated with ACL injury and reconstruction, then overall vitamin D status may be an important effector of recovery. Concentrations of vitamin D needed to support optimal recovery may differ from typical clinical cut points used to diagnose vitamin D deficiency, which could have powerful therapeutic implications following ACL injury and reconstruction. This is especially important given recent research showing over 50% of athletes have vitamin D inadequacy. We hypothesized that subjects with circulating &lt;strong>vitamin D sufficient to suppress parathyroid hormone secretion (≥ 40 ng/mL)&lt;/strong> would be better protected against quadriceps atrophy at the conclusion of rehabilitation. Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained from ACL-injured and Healthy limbs of 16 participants (6M,10F; 19±5yr, body mass index: 25.1±3.7kg/m2) prior to surgical reconstruction, 1 week following reconstruction (Recon), and following the completion of post-surgical rehabilitation (6 months following surgery, Post-Rehab). RNA was isolated from all quadriceps biopsies, followed by library construction, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. Transcript abundance of vitamin D activating pathway regulators (vitamin D receptor &lt;span>[VDR]&lt;/span>, and Cytochrome P450 2R1 &lt;span>[CYP2R1]&lt;/span> and Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 &lt;span>[CYP27B1]&lt;/span>) was assessed following analysis using DESeq2 and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment of p-values. Additionally, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was assessed in serum samples obtained at the time of reconstruction surgery. Quadriceps fiber cross-sectional area was measured via laminin immunohistochemistry. Recon (1 week post-surgery) muscle showed increased transcript abundance of the vitamin D receptor, VDR(elevated 7.8 fold, FDR&amp;lt;0.05), and vitamin D-activating pathway regulators CYP2R1 (elevated 1.5 fold, FDR&amp;lt;0.05) and CYP27B1 (elevated 2.6 fold, FDR&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to the Healthy limb.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Better handgrip strength if some good vitamin D genes (or if supplement)</title><link>/posts/better-handgrip-strength-if-some-good-vitamin-d-genes-or-if-supplement.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/better-handgrip-strength-if-some-good-vitamin-d-genes-or-if-supplement.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Background: The impact of vitamin D on musculoskeletal health is well-established, although its influence on physical performance is unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the impact of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) concentrations with maximal aerobic power of professional indoor athletes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resistance training can be aided by Vitamin D, 50,000 IU monthly is not often enough – RCT</title><link>/posts/resistance-training-can-be-aided-by-vitamin-d-50000-iu-monthly-is-not-often-enough-rct.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/resistance-training-can-be-aided-by-vitamin-d-50000-iu-monthly-is-not-often-enough-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effects-of-vitamin-d3-supplementation-and-resistance-training-on-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-status-and-functional-performance-of-older-adults-a-randomized-placebo-controlled-trial">Effects of Vitamin D3 Supplementation and Resistance Training on 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Status and Functional Performance of Older Adults: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D status is associated with muscle strength and performance in older adults. To examine the additive effects of vitamin D3 supplementation during resistance training, 100 seniors (65-85 years) participated in a 16-week intervention. Besides a daily dose of 400 mg of calcium, participants received either 800 IU vitamin D3 per day (VDD), 50,000 IU vitamin D3 per month (VDM) or nothing (CON). After the initial loading phase of four weeks, all groups started a 10-week resistance training program. Assessments of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status, muscle strength endurance (30-s chair stand and arm curl tests), aerobic capacity (6-min walk test) and functional mobility (gait speed and timed up and go test) were undertaken at baseline, after four weeks and at the end of the study. 25(OH)D status significantly improved in VDD and VDM, but not in CON (time x group: p = 0.021), as 15.2% of CON, 40.0% of VDD and 61.1% of VDM reached vitamin D sufficiency (&amp;gt;30 ng/mL; p = 0.004). Chair stand test, arm curl test, 6-min walk test, gait speed and timed up and go test improved over the whole intervention period (p &amp;lt; 0.05), however only chair stand and arm curl test were selectively affected by resistance training (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Neither muscle strength endurance, nor functional mobility or aerobic capacity were modulated by vitamin D supplementation. Therefore, the mere amelioration of 25(OH)D status of older adults does not lead to an additive effect on muscular performance during RT.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off Topic: Exercycle for high-intensity exercise with UV</title><link>/posts/off-topic-exercycle-for-high-intensity-exercise-with-uv.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-exercycle-for-high-intensity-exercise-with-uv.html</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/spinner-with-lables.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

&lt;p>With the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, athletes have been restricted from outdoor training. This has affected the nutritional status of athletes in various ways, especially with regard to their vitamin D status/level, which is produced in response to sun exposure. Vitamin D is essential for maintaining bone mass, muscle strength and physical performance. It likewise plays multiple other roles in the body, such as helping in calcium absorption and supporting the immune system.1 Therefore, sufficient vitamin D is indispensable not only for keeping healthy musculoskeletal conditions, but also for improving immune response, especially amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wattage produced by Elite indoor athletes: 3.9 W per kg if high Vitamin D vs 3.5 if low</title><link>/posts/wattage-produced-by-elite-indoor-athletes-39-w-per-kg-if-high-vitamin-d-vs-35-if-low.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wattage-produced-by-elite-indoor-athletes-39-w-per-kg-if-high-vitamin-d-vs-35-if-low.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="influence-of-25-hydroxy-vitamin-d-insufficiency-on-maximal-aerobic-power-in-elite-indoor-athletes-a-cross-sectional-study">Influence of 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin D Insufficiency on Maximal Aerobic Power in Elite Indoor Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The term stress fracture is familiar to many doctors, therapists and athletes. Stress fractures, either partial or complete, are common overuse injuries caused by a repetitive submaximal bone loading &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. The location of the stress fracture varies from sport to sport, but is most commonly observed in the lower extremities &lt;sup>[2,3]&lt;/sup>. They are particularly common in the physically active individuals including but not limited to track and field athletes, long distance runners, dancers, and military recruits &lt;sup>[2,3]&lt;/sup>. The prevalence of stress fractures is estimated to be between 6.5-9.7% among athletes of different sport disciplines &lt;sup>[4]&lt;/sup>.

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism is reported to be associated with muscle mass and muscle strength. Loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle strength are the main characteristics of sarcopenia. In this study, the relationship of VDR gene polymorphism with muscle traits (muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance) and sarcopenia were studied in Xinjiang, China.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Child soccer players who were deficient were helped by a single 200,000 IU vitamin D dose – RCT</title><link>/posts/child-soccer-players-who-were-deficient-were-helped-by-a-single-200000-iu-vitamin-d-dose-rct.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/child-soccer-players-who-were-deficient-were-helped-by-a-single-200000-iu-vitamin-d-dose-rct.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>50,000 IU Vitamin D weekly provided enough benefit for combat sport athletes</title><link>/posts/50000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-provided-enough-benefit-for-combat-sport-athletes.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/50000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-provided-enough-benefit-for-combat-sport-athletes.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="weekly-vitamin-d-3-supplementation-improves-aerobic-performance-in-combat-sport-athletes">Weekly Vitamin D 3 Supplementation Improves Aerobic Performance in Combat Sport Athletes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The experiment examined the effects 4 weeks of vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation versus placebo on musculoskeletal and psychomotor performance. Thirty-two college age males (Age: 22 ± 4 y, Height: 177.7 ± 8.3 cm, Weight: 81.5 ± 14.6 kg, BF%: 19.6 ± 7.9, Vit D: 20.0 ± 7.2 ng/ml). Participants were assigned to group (Vit D vs placebo) and remained blind throughout the study. The treatments were &lt;strong>4000 IU&lt;/strong> of Vit D3 or placebo (dextrose) administered daily for 4 weeks. The participants underwent baseline testing for isometric strength, explosive ability and psychomotor performance, which was repeated at week 2 and week 4. Isometric tests consisted of an Isometric Mid Thigh Pull on a Force Plate (IMTP) and an upper body isometric test (UBIST) using a load cell. Peak force during a countermovement jump (CMJ) was also determined via force plate. A psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) was used to measure sustained reaction time. Analysis of the UBIST data did not reveal a significant group × time interaction (p = 0.14; Vit D pre: 553.7 ± 168.3 N, post: 585.5 ± 150.2 N; Placebo pre: 677.7 ± 182.3 N, post: 649.8 ± 236.9 N). For IMTP no significant group × time interaction (p = 0.83; Vit D pre: 2596.4 ± 342.3 N, post: 2606.9 ± 378.3 N; Placebo pre: 2684.0 ± 432.9 N, post: 2762.6 ± 440.4 N) was found. CMJ analysis did not reveal interaction effects for group × time (p = 0.21; Vit D pre: 4429.7 ± 1619.0 N, post: 4938.5 ± 2374.8 N; Placebo pre: 5537.3 ± 3027.0 N, post: 6266.9 ± 4577.3 N). For PVT (mean reaction time) there was no significant interaction effects for group × time (p = 0.35; Vit D pre: 0.304 ± 0.041 sec, post: 0.301 ± 0.053 sec; Placebo pre: 0.295 ± 0.044 sec, post: 0.284 ± 0.029 sec). In conclusion, four weeks of Vit D supplementation was not effective in increasing musculoskeletal or psychomotor performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My balance significantly improved at age 73 (perhaps Vitamin D, B12, or Omega-3)</title><link>/posts/my-balance-significantly-improved-at-age-73-perhaps-vitamin-d-b12-or-omega-3.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/my-balance-significantly-improved-at-age-73-perhaps-vitamin-d-b12-or-omega-3.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="wonder-why-my-balance-improved">Wonder why my balance improved&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>With millions of dollars at stake, Wall Street Journal ( WSJ) was one of the first to catch on to my pioneering work of &amp;quot; &lt;strong>vitamin D3 improves athletic performance, reduces athletic injuries, concussions/ CTE, and saves sports teams millions of dollars.&lt;/strong> &amp;quot; As a trauma surgeon at the busiest Level I trauma center in the U.S. ( Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia), I have seen 30 years of the worst of the worst trauma patients. The Wall Street Journal gets it! Using vitamin D3 saves millions of dollars, keeps sports teams healthy, reduce injuries and concussions, improves athletic performance, and increase chances of winning more games and championships. Not taking vitamin D3 is putting your players and team&amp;rsquo;s health at risk. The NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, and other professional, college, and sports at all levels will have to sit down and talk to me at some point. I am approximately 10 years ahead of everybody on this subject matter. I pioneered it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mechanisms of vitamin D action in skeletal muscle</title><link>/posts/mechanisms-of-vitamin-d-action-in-skeletal-muscle.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/mechanisms-of-vitamin-d-action-in-skeletal-muscle.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Vitamin D and the Athlete – a complex problem</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-the-athlete-a-complex-problem.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-the-athlete-a-complex-problem.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-and-the-athlete--an-oversimplified-complex-biological-problem">VITAMIN D AND THE ATHLETE – AN OVERSIMPLIFIED, COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>A clinical study was undertaken to evaluate the associations between the tissue levels of omega-3 (N3), also known as the Omega-3 Index (N3 Index), on various clinical and quality of life outcomes in healthy young adults after heavy eccentric exercise. To ensure an adequate number of participants with an elevated N3 index would be available for comparison to those with a lower N3 Index, a subgroup of the study participants received N3 dietary supplementation (2.7 g-d-1) for 30 days prior to the performance of the heavy eccentric exercise. The remaining participants received a placebo supplement for the same 30- day period. After 30 days of supplementation, participants performed an eccentric exercise routine and were then measured at baseline (time 0), 24-, 48-, 72-, and 96 hours respectively on the following outcomes; C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase. Blood lactate levels were analyzed immediately after the exercise. Functional measurements of delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS), extension and torque were also analyzed. Quality of life (QOL) was measured by the quantitative questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States Questionnaire (POMS). Safety monitoring and analysis of adverse events was continuous throughout the study. Differences as demonstrated by a reduction in pain following eccentric exercise was experienced at both 72 and 96 hour time points in subjects with a higher N3 Index however there were no differences in extension or strength between the two groups. There was a significant difference in blood lactate levels (p = 0.0309) and improved emotional stability, reflected by the POMS questionnaire, in subjects with a higher N3 Index level. There was a statistically significant difference in CRP levels in subjects with a higher N3 Index level at 24 hours and a trend toward significance over 96 hours. There were no significant differences in creatine kinase levels and no reported adverse events. Subjects with a higher Omega-3 (N3) Index reported less pain related to DOMS following heavy exercise at 72 and 96 hours post-exercise. Reduced pain in the higher N3 Index Group may be due to an increased concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in the muscle cell walls, thus triggering a higher elasticity, flexibility and lower risk of physical damage to muscle tissue during exercise. Serum levels of blood lactate were lower in subjects with a high N3 Index, CRP was reduced at 24 hours and POMS scores were improved in high N3 Index subjects demonstrating better QOL. No serious adverse events were reported further supporting that omega-3 dietary supplementation is safe, bio-available and may improve athletic performance and well being in healthy young adults.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>College football injuries 5.9 X more likely if low pre-season vitamin D – thesis</title><link>/posts/college-football-injuries-59-x-more-likely-if-low-pre-season-vitamin-d-thesis.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/college-football-injuries-59-x-more-likely-if-low-pre-season-vitamin-d-thesis.html</guid><description>&lt;div class="border" style="background-color:#FFFAE2;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:700px">

&lt;p>Children and adolescents have the highest rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI), with mild TBI (mTBI) accounting for most of these injuries. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable and often suffer from post-injury symptomologies that may persist for months. We hypothesized that the combination of resveratrol (RES), prebiotic fiber (PBF), and omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) would be an effective therapeutic supplement for the mitigation of mTBI outcomes in the developing brain. Adolescent male and female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the supplement (3S) or control condition, which was followed by a mTBI or sham insult. A behavioral test battery designed to examine symptomologies commonly associated with mTBI was administered. Following the test battery, tissue was collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and primary auditory cortex for Golgi-Cox analysis of spine density, and for changes in expression of 6 genes (Aqp4, Gfap, Igf1, Nfl, Sirt1, and Tau). 3S treatment altered the behavioural performance of sham animals indicating that dietary manipulations modify premorbid characteristics. 3S treatment prevented injury-related deficits in the longer-term behaviour measures, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) spine density, and levels of Aqp4, Gfap, Igf1, Nfl, and Sirt1 expression in the PFC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seniors gained 0.3 kg of muscle in 6 weeks with 800 IU and Leucine protein</title><link>/posts/seniors-gained-03-kg-of-muscle-in-6-weeks-with-800-iu-and-leucine-protein.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/seniors-gained-03-kg-of-muscle-in-6-weeks-with-800-iu-and-leucine-protein.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="supplementing-breakfast-with-a-vitamin-d-and-leucineenriched-whey-protein-medical-nutrition-drink-enhances-postprandial-muscle-protein-synthesis-and-muscle-mass-in-healthy-older-men">Supplementing Breakfast with a Vitamin D and Leucine–Enriched Whey Protein Medical Nutrition Drink Enhances Postprandial Muscle Protein Synthesis and Muscle Mass in Healthy Older Men&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background • Vitamin K1 and K2 are not typically common in a Western diet because they are found in a variety of fermented foods. Vitamin K2 in particular has been demonstrated to restore mitochondrial function and has a key role in production of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that dietary supplementation with vitamin K2 could increase the function of muscle with high mitochondrial content (ie, skeletal and cardiac muscle).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The USADA should ban vitamin D</title><link>/posts/the-usada-should-ban-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-usada-should-ban-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="should-usada-ban-vitamin-d-and-zinchttpforumssherdogcomthreadsshould-usada-ban-vitamin-d-and-zinc3580155-martial-arts-website">&lt;a href="http://forums.sherdog.com/threads/should-usada-ban-vitamin-d-and-zinc.3580155/">Should USADA ban vitamin D and zinc?&lt;/a> Martial Arts website&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Muscle cells are elongated and cylindrical in shape and are surrounded by a basal lamina of insulating collagen. In the space between muscle cells and their basal lamina there are several types of satellite cells that play a regulatory role in the growth, maintenance and repair of muscle cells. Each muscle cell contains myofibrils, bundles of several types of proteins organized into repeating microanatomical structures known as sarcomeres, which are the structural units making up the contractile machinery of muscle cells. A sarcomere is comprised of two types of protein filaments: tick filaments mainly composed of the protein myosin and thin filaments composed of the protein actin. Groups of tens to hundreds of muscle cells are packed together into parallel bundles known as fascicles which are wrapped in connective tissue, the perimysium, while bundles of fascicles composing a particular muscle are wrapped by the epimysium.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Handgrip strength dropped by 20 percent in the last generation (perhaps due to lower vitamin D)</title><link>/posts/handgrip-strength-dropped-by-20-percent-in-the-last-generation-perhaps-due-to-lower-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/handgrip-strength-dropped-by-20-percent-in-the-last-generation-perhaps-due-to-lower-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="raising-the-american-weaklinghttpnautilusissue45powerraising-the-american-weaklingutm_sourcediggutm_mediumemail">&lt;a href="http://nautil.us/issue/45/power/raising-the-american-weakling?utm_source=digg&amp;amp;utm_medium=email">Raising the American Weakling&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Increasing evidence indicates that compromised vitamin D status, as indicated by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D), is associated with decreased muscle function. The purpose of this study was to determine the vitamin D status of collegiate athletes residing in the southern U.S. and its effects on muscular strength and anaerobic power. Collegiate athletes (n=103) from three separate NCAA athletic programs were recruited for the study. Anthropometrics, vitamin D and calcium intake, and sun exposure data were collected along with serum 25-OH D and physical performance measures (Vertical Jump Test, Shuttle Run Test, Triple Hop for Distance Test and the 1 &lt;strong>Repetition Maximum Squat Test&lt;/strong> ) to determine the influence of vitamin D status on muscular strength and anaerobic power.

&lt;p>The purpose of this review is to examine vitamin D in the context of sport nutrition and its potential role in optimizing athletic performance. Vitamin D receptors (VDR) and vitamin D response elements (VDREs) are located in almost every tissue within the human body including skeletal muscle. The hormonally-active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has been shown to play critical roles in the human body and regulates over 900 gene variants. Based on the literature presented, it is plausible that vitamin D levels above the normal reference range (up to 100 nmol/L) might increase skeletal muscle function, decrease recovery time from training, increase both force and power production, and increase testosterone production, each of which could potentiate athletic performance. Therefore, maintaining higher levels of vitamin D could prove beneficial for athletic performance. Despite this situation, large portions of athletic populations are vitamin D deficient. Currently, the research is inconclusive with regards to the optimal intake of vitamin D, the specific forms of vitamin D one should ingest, and the distinct nutrient-nutrient interactions of vitamin D with vitamin K that affect arterial calcification and hypervitaminosis. Furthermore, it is possible that dosages exceeding the recommendations for vitamin D (i.e. dosages up to 4000-5000 IU/day), in combination with 50 to 1000 mcg/day of vitamin K1 and K2 could aid athletic performance. This review will investigate these topics, and specifically their relevance to athletic performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Football Brain injuries prevented by Omega-3 – RCT</title><link>/posts/football-brain-injuries-prevented-by-omega-3-rct.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/football-brain-injuries-prevented-by-omega-3-rct.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Doctors Say Top Athletes Take Vitamin D And So Should You - CBS News</title><link>/posts/doctors-say-top-athletes-take-vitamin-d-and-so-should-you-cbs-news.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/doctors-say-top-athletes-take-vitamin-d-and-so-should-you-cbs-news.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Elite Athletes Try a New Training Tactic: More Vitamin D - WSJ</title><link>/posts/elite-athletes-try-a-new-training-tactic-more-vitamin-d-wsj.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/elite-athletes-try-a-new-training-tactic-more-vitamin-d-wsj.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="elite-athletes-try-a-new-training-tactic-more-vitamin-dhttpwwwwsjcomarticleselite-athletes-try-a-new-training-tactic-more-vitamin-d-1453745154">&lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/elite-athletes-try-a-new-training-tactic-more-vitamin-d-1453745154">Elite Athletes Try a New Training Tactic: More Vitamin D&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is an essential, fat-soluble nutrient that is a key modulator of bone health. Despite the gaining popularity throughout published medical studies, no consensus has been reached regarding a serum vitamin D level that will guarantee adequate skeletal health in a patient with an increased functional demand. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the serum concentrations of vitamin D in patients with confirmed stress fractures. A total of 124 patients were included in our retrospective cohort study. Of the 124 patients, 53 had vitamin D levels measured within 3 months of diagnosis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intense exercise increases vitamin D receptor activation</title><link>/posts/intense-exercise-increases-vitamin-d-receptor-activation.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/intense-exercise-increases-vitamin-d-receptor-activation.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Vitamin D is the main hormone of bone metabolism. However, the ubiquitary nature of vitamin D receptor (VDR) suggests potential for widespread effects, which has led to new research exploring the effects of vitamin D on a variety of tissues, especially in the skeletal muscle. In vitro studies have shown that the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, acts in myocytes through genomic effects involving VDR activation in the cell nucleus to drive cellular differentiation and proliferation. A putative transmembrane receptor may be responsible for nongenomic effects leading to rapid influx of calcium within muscle cells. Hypovitaminosis D is consistently associated with decrease in muscle function and performance and increase in disability. On the contrary, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to improve muscle strength and gait in different settings, especially in elderly patients. Despite some controversies in the interpretation of meta-analysis, a reduced risk of falls has been attributed to vitamin D supplementation due to direct effects on muscle cells. Finally, a low vitamin D status is consistently associated with the frail phenotype. This is why many authorities recommend vitamin D supplementation in the frail patient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NCAA athletes – one third had low levels of vitamin D, 19X more likely if black race</title><link>/posts/ncaa-athletes-one-third-had-low-levels-of-vitamin-d-19x-more-likely-if-black-race.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ncaa-athletes-one-third-had-low-levels-of-vitamin-d-19x-more-likely-if-black-race.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="prevalence-of-abnormal-vitamin-d-levels-among-division-i-ncaa-athletes">Prevalence of Abnormal Vitamin D Levels Among Division I NCAA Athletes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By maintaining phosphate and calcium homeostasis, vitamin D is critical for bone health and possibly physical performance. Hence, vitamin D is important to athletes. Few studies have investigated vitamin D levels in relation to fractures and performance in athletes, and no published study has included a multiracial sample of professional American football players.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weight loss includes muscle loss unless add vitamin D, whey and leucine – RCT</title><link>/posts/weight-loss-includes-muscle-loss-unless-add-vitamin-d-whey-and-leucine-rct.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/weight-loss-includes-muscle-loss-unless-add-vitamin-d-whey-and-leucine-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="a-high-whey-protein-leucine--and-vitamin-denriched-supplement-preserves-muscle-mass-during-intentional-weight-loss-in-obese-older-adults-a-double-blind-randomized-controlled-trial">A high whey protein–, leucine-, and vitamin D–enriched supplement preserves muscle mass during intentional weight loss in obese older adults: a double-blind randomized controlled trial&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Interest in Vitamin D has risen considerably recently with &lt;strong>many athletes now advised to take daily vitamin D supplements&lt;/strong> .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason for this interest is partly not only attributed to the resurgence of the Vitamin D-deficient disease rickets but also due to the discovery of a Vitamin D receptor in many tissues suggesting a more global role for Vitamin D than previously considered. Unlike the other vitamins that are obtained through the diet, Vitamin D is unique since endogenous synthesis following ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure is the predominant route of entry into systemic circulation. Moreover, Vitamin D could be better classed as a seco-steroid, given that its structure is similar to that of a steroid, and its production is derived from a cholesterol precursor (7-dehydrocholesteol) in the skin. The classification of Vitamin D status is currently subject to considerable debate with many authors opposing governing body recommendations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D supplementation improves muscle strength in healthy adults – meta-analysis of 6 RCT</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-improves-muscle-strength-in-healthy-adults-meta-analysis-of-6-rct.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-improves-muscle-strength-in-healthy-adults-meta-analysis-of-6-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effects-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-on-upper-and-lower-body-muscle-strength-levels-in-healthy-individuals-a-systematic-review-with-meta-analysis">Effects of vitamin D supplementation on upper and lower body muscle strength levels in healthy individuals.

&lt;p>Objectives: To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength in healthy individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Design: A systematic review with meta-analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: In October 2013 a computerised literature search of three databases (Pubmed, Web of Knowledge and Scopus) was performed. Included in the review were controlled and randomised controlled trials, published in English, which measured muscle strength and serum Vitamin D concentration in participants 18-40 years old. References of identified articles were then cross-checked and citations scanned for additional articles. Quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. Muscle strength and Vitamin D levels were extracted for a meta-analysis on upper and lower limb strength with standardised mean differences calculated to analyse effect.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D supplementation help muscles of seniors who are vitamin D deficient – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-help-muscles-of-seniors-who-are-vitamin-d-deficient-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-supplementation-help-muscles-of-seniors-who-are-vitamin-d-deficient-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-effects-of-vitamin-d-on-skeletal-muscle-strength-muscle-mass-and-muscle-power-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-randomized-controlled-trials">The effects of vitamin D on skeletal muscle strength, muscle mass and muscle power: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.&lt;/h4>

 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>My guest today is Henry Lahore. He runs the website called VitaminDWiki.com where you can find tons of information on Vitamin D. I actually came across this site when I was looking for some information on Vitamin D and ended up buying one of the Vitamin D bulbs you recommended. So Henry, thanks so much for being part of the show.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Sure. Great.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So how did you … Tell me a little bit about your background? How did you get interested in the importance of Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I’ve been interested in the importance of various supplements and healthy living for most of my life and have enjoyed sharing information with lots of people on all sorts of topics. About 4 years ago, a friend got me interested in Vitamin D after he found that his back pain went away really suddenly after taking extra Vitamin D. So I started exploring that and about a month into it, I came up with as I’ve done for many other things 10 questions for myself is to what is this about Vitamin D? &lt;br>What things does it really help with? &lt;br>What things does it sort of help with? &lt;br>What does it treat? &lt;br>What does it prevent? &lt;br>What is its toxic level? &lt;br>So anyway I had 10 questions that you could see under &lt;a href="https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/AboutUs">About US&lt;/a> at the Vitamin D website. I answered all of those myself and continued on – about 6,000 hours into gathering Vitamin D information. It’s been very nice in helping people around the world with Vitamin D.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So what are some of the more important things that you’ve learned? I mean, the main thing that I think about with Vitamin D is the health for your bones but there is a ton of other things on your website. What are some of the big ones?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>You can put them into 2 different categories for your listeners. There’s … One category is in terms of sports and general health. The other category is avoiding major kinds of diseases that people get later in their 40’s, 50’s, 60’s, but so kind of 2 categories. Let’s talk about the health benefits from a sports point of view or feeling healthy when you’re in your 30’s and 40’s or 20’s. There are lots of things there under the … Of the 5,000 or so studies that I have on the website; I’ve categorized many of them into about 160 different categories. One of which is sports. So if you go to overview on sports and Vitamin D, you can see what the benefits are there for the person – I am going there right now.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>One of the things that you e-mailed me about was this idea that you really need to get out in the sun during the middle of the day, between 10 and 3 PM if you want to get any Vitamin D on your skin. You even showed me a link to some &lt;strong>tan-through shirts&lt;/strong> , which I thought were pretty cool. How does that work and how much time do we actually need to spend in the sun to get adequate Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. So let’s talk about it from that point of view, in terms of how does a person who is a runner for instance, your particular clientele, get more Vitamin D. Actually, you get … Probably an adequate amount of Vitamin D if you can run in the … Sort of the noontime area in this sunny day in the summer part of your world. That’s just fine. You probably don’t need any more Vitamin D. However, it’s for the other people who, maybe it’s too hot in their climate to run in the middle of the day and so they have to run way in the morning or way in the evening. I went down to Singapore for instance 2 years ago. I saw lots of runners at 6AM but they kind have went away by 7AM because it’s too hot. So they weren’t getting much Vitamin D, anyway, likewise if cloudy day and such.&lt;br>So ways of adding Vitamin D for one simple way that I checked, I’m suspecting as much and you have to check that out. You can buy the tan-through shirt. There’s 2 different companies selling it. You can find out about it on the &lt;a href="/tags/website.html">website&lt;/a>. It reduces the amount of Vitamin D by about a factor of 2 from what you would get if you are nude above the shirt, above the waist. That gives a significant amount of extra Vitamin D for people who might not feel comfortable being shirtless while jogging along.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So what are some of the benefits that you’ve personally seen since trying to increase your Vitamin D and do you do that mainly through supplementation?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>&lt;a href="/tags/as-youll-see-on-the-website.html">As you’ll see on the website&lt;/a>, I consider the sun as being the best source. UV is being the second best source and supplementation is the third source but the supplement -&lt;br> you get a little bit better advantages, the higher up you can go on that curve, but straight supplementation provides a lot of advantages. So I get my sun … When it’s sunny, I live in Seattle. It’s kind of cloudy much of the time, so I get the sun during the summer in addition to having UV and in addition to having the supplementation from the supplements I take.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So you mentioned there that the sun is probably the best way to get Vitamin D. What kind of research have you come across that would indicate that? Why is the sun any better?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Don’t really know quite why it’s better. I guess in general, from like your Paleo site, the more whole foods you get, the better it is and they can’t quite figure out why that’s the case. They’ve seen that you get a particular B supplement or E supplement or such. That’s pretty good but not quite as good as getting it from the food. Well, that turns out to be the case for the sun as well. There are various problems that can be greatly avoided: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, and a few other odds ends. They’re finding … Like for instance for multiple sclerosis that you significantly decrease … I guess significant better impact to the body or benefit to the body by getting your Vitamin D levels in your blood up to the same level. &lt;br>You get a much better benefit if that Vitamin D came from the sun or UV than if it came from a supplement. The science is. . . I’ll probably give it they may get it down pat from about 5 years from now – as to why that is, but that’s how it is right now.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned how that’s …&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Go ahead.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I was just going to say, you mentioned how that’s similar to the Paleo Diet and I think that is true is … We’ve evolved for a long time living in a more ancestral environment where we are outdoors a lot and I think science, in 100 years from now is probably going to look back and they’ll have the reasons for why the more natural living is better, but now, a huge amount of data shows that trying to live a more natural habitat is probably the way to go.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes, and I agree with that. I don’t know. I can’t point to a specific study that says so, but there’s more and more hints that way. Along those lines. So I’ve got various people that come to me and say, “Well, I don’t take any supplements. I couldn’t get everything I need from food.” And well, that used to be correct up until about 100 years ago. But now, there’s … If you look at the amount of Vitamin D content in food, I’d say 100 years ago, an apple pie would have 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D in a slice of apple pie. Because the pigs that made the lard to make the apple pie with were outdoors and their fat have 500 IUs of Vitamin D per tablespoon.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So if you’ve worked through the numbers, that’s how it worked … That’s how you got the extra Vitamin D. That’s one example. Likewise, the bacon, likewise, chicken eggs that used to have 4 times as much Vitamin D as it does now when the … Well, chickens indoors, pigs indoors, etc., they’re not getting their Vitamin D.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So what … I actually went ahead and bought &lt;a href="/tags/one-of-these-vitamin-d-lamps.html">one of these Vitamin D lamps&lt;/a>. It’s called the Sperti Vitamin D lamp. On your website, you have a lot of different products, not that you sell but just that you kind of described that could be helpful to people. What are some of the things that you found … I know I saw some of the lamps, you can buy on Amazon for $15 or $20 that are UV lamps? Are those going to be just as effective or how can you use those?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Not nearly … There are a little bit effective … &lt;a href="/tags/i-actually-bought-i-think-4-or-5-different-ones.html">I actually bought I think 4 or 5 different ones&lt;/a> myself to give it a try. I’ve got a UV meter that looks at the exact amount of light that’s coming out of it and some of the … I have on the website what the company says is the amount of UV coming out. It’s pretty good. It’s correct. Some other companies don’t say how much is coming out so I just measured it myself.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. What did you find?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It’s basically the more you pay for it, the more UV you get.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Down with the $10, $15 level, you get some UV, which works out to … Some of those by the way, the really little cost ones are under of $25, $30 are designed for reptiles.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Right.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The reptiles and many other animals really need to have UV and if you have a pet reptile, it will die off or have a poor life or look really lousy after a couple of years of not being out in the sun. That actually happens with lots of birds, too but … So they found that by putting a little compact fluorescent bulb that puts out a little bit of UV that really perks up the reptile, they feel a lot better and have baby ones, etc. But the amount of UV that comes out through that is not very cost-effective or worthwhile for human use. You could have a little UV light like that and provided you’re wearing glasses so that the UV doesn’t get into your eyes but just gets to your body. &lt;br>Let’s say you’re semi-nude in front of the lamp, you have to spend … I’m just guessing . . . 2 hours a day to get a minimal amount that you can get for a 2-cent worth of Vitamin D supplement. So it’s not, not very … If you look at the cost of your time for doing something when we’re talking pennies for hour, most people time is worth more than pennies per hour.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Right. Right.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The brand you bought was a pretty pricey one. It’s got a fair amount of output and it’s pretty well but that was beyond my spare of change level. I guess that’s why I came up with was not spare-change either. Anyway, at $150 level, I installed it next to my bathroom and I use it while I’m brushing my teeth or shaving and such and it puts up about 500 … It gives you about 500 IUs in 5 minutes, which is okay. It’s not great but it’s nice so I use that.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Why are you using that? Are you having to wear protective eyewear?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No. As it turns out, all you want to do is just make sure that the light doesn’t get directly to your eyes. If you’re just wearing regular glasses, 99.9% of all glasses stop UV even if it says that it’s … Even if It doesn’t mention it, the glasses really do, they have to go out of their way to not stop UVB.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay. Well you know, I really like it in the sun and since I’ve started a more … A Paleo diet and learning more about the importance of Vitamin D, I’ve been getting more sun on my skin but what about people who say, you really got to be careful. You shouldn’t … You should always wear sunscreen when you go outside. &lt;strong>Is there a risk of cancer?&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>There is a … There’s a risk, as you probably aware from lots of things. If you overdo anything, there is a problem to your body. If you drink too much water every day, there’s a problem to your body. If you have too much salt, if you have too much sun, if you have too much of anything, there is a problem. So the Australians for instance, the people who are the most for having sunscreen, they’ve finally come around to saying, “No, doggonit.” Probably if you’re outdoors, that’s going to vary with exactly where you are but if … You could probably look at it in terms of how hot it feels. If it’s not really hot, that is to say, over 80 or 90 degrees, then you can probably be outside, just fine, no problems of cancer at all for like 15 minutes to half an hour provided you’re getting used to it.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The problems that people have with cancer or with your skin having difficulties in burning and other odds and ends often come when they do it too suddenly. That is to say, they’re indoors all the season and all of a sudden, OKAY. Let’s go out and be outdoors for 4 hours or 6 hours very first time for the season. Woa, you run into problems with that. My dad, as an example, was a carpenter and he never suntanned, he never sunburned, and yet he was out every day. So it’s that gradualness. So if you have a person who … Okay, let’s say a runner who has not been running for a while or has been indoors for a while then all of a sudden decides in … For the Northern part of the world, decides in May … Okay. I’m going to go out and jog or be outdoors for 2 or 3 hours, no, that’s a little incorrect in the Southern part of the United States. You could be out there for a while but you had better put the sunscreen on. By the way, just a little subset of this, it turns out that if you have enough Vitamin D in your body, whether it’s coming from the sun or from supplements, you don’t burn nearly as much. That’s one of the small inconsequential benefits or hardly noted benefits that I have for Vitamin D over the last 3 years that I’ve had a lot of it. I haven’t burned once. In fact, I went for a bicycle ride. I was kind of trying this out in a very sunny climate in May this year. I bicycled such that the sun was on one side of me only for 2 ½ hours right at noon time and I felt like I was going to be getting … It reminded me of having going to be getting a &lt;strong>bad sunburn&lt;/strong> from that I had for many years. At the end of the day, nothing. The next day, I couldn’t tell the difference of the sun tanning on one leg versus the other. The other leg was essentially in the shadow from not being seeing the sun at all. That’s how it is with bicycling because you only go on one direction oftentimes.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Right. Right. Interesting. Now, I had a lady on the podcast a few weeks ago. Her name was Stephanie Seneff and she wasn’t quite sure about this but she thought that perhaps Vitamin D supplementation might actually in some way trick the body in that it’s providing you with Vitamin D as a marker in your blood but whether it was really having the same benefits as the sun. You seem to say the same thing. Would you agree with that sentiment?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I’ve read a little bit about her stuff. I’m not in complete agreement. I find it very intriguing what she says. I guess I agree in terms of what I stated a little bit ago that I believe the sun is better than UV, which is better than Vitamin D. Then the other part, I often say, is if you’re going to take only a single supplement, it should be Vitamin D.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I use quite a variety, like about 30 different supplements in different amounts and &amp;hellip; But Vitamin D has taken the place of virtually all of those. I’m feeling far better than I used to by taking a whole, witches brew of various supplements.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>How old are you, Henry?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>About 69.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay and before we started recording, Henry actually told me that he’s still biking around 100 miles a week and he used to run upwards of 100 miles a week. So he’s staying in very good shape and do you think that the Vitamin D that you’re supplementing with or getting from the sun has helped with your &lt;strong>longevity&lt;/strong> as far as exercise?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, absolutely. In fact, my wife has stated quite easily that … Quite often that she feels she’s 10 years younger because of taking Vitamin D. I know for myself, I used to have at my age lots of little aches and pains and my heels would be cracking and I’d have to put heel cream on it all the time, all the time like 20 times a year especially in the winter. I’d get a little bit of creakiness getting out of bed and have to pull myself up out of bed holding on to the piece of furniture there. And getting little aches and pains in my … Anyway, just feeling older, okay? I no longer feel older. I feel like I’m in my 40’s maybe instead of my … end of my 60’s.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Wow. Wow and has there been other changes in your life that could have helped you feel younger or has Vitamin D been the main change?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Vitamin D has been the main change. I’ve done a couple of other things, &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/tags/omega-3.html">Omega 3&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> I’ve been having … I’ve been doing that for about 6 or 8 years now and it’s quite good. I’ve been adding &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/tags/magnesium.html">Magnesium&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> recently. By the way, I studied through and have probably looked at 200, 300 different studies concerning the &lt;a href="/tags/cofactors.html"> &lt;strong>cofactors&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> to go along with Vitamin D and I’m taking all of the necessary cofactors with Vitamin D. I’ve got on there as to how you can increase the benefit, the response in your body to the Vitamin D, which you actually get, &lt;a href="/tags/by-a-factor-of-two.html"> &lt;strong>by a factor of two&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> by doing the various things, such that I now have the quite high Vitamin D level that most people would consider to be excessive, but I don’t consider to be excessive. &lt;br>That just reminds me of the little note, &lt;strong>how much Vitamin D should you have&lt;/strong> . There’s various recommendations as to the number of nanograms per milliliter that you should have. Some places around the world have this … They say 10 nanograms is enough! The United States says 20 nanograms is enough! A great number of scientists who have looked at this say: &lt;strong>&lt;a href="/tags/somewhere-between-30-and-100-nanograms-is-good.html">somewhere between 30 and 100 nanograms is good&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> ].&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The … Looks as though the optimum level is somewhere between 40 and 80 nanograms for most people. In fact, I’m putting together a video on Vitamin D and will be stating that as being the optimum level to have that you wish that you should have at least 40 nanograms. There’s some people down in Brazil . . a doctor down there who’s been treating people, &lt;a href="/tags/treating-people-with-multiple-sclerosis.html">treating people with &lt;strong>multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> and reversing and sometimes completely eliminating the multiple sclerosis and he gets his people up to 150 nanograms of Vitamin D. So that’s for treating.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I happen to be about 120.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh wow. Now, you mentioned a few … Some co-factors that you’re taking along to increase your Vitamin D by as much as 100% or 200%.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>By 100, … It’s doubling the Vitamin D in your body by … In fact; I’ve got the numbers there if you’re going through the co-factors. Little costs and the co-factor section on the Wiki as to … There’s about 5 things you can do. Some of which are the co-factors in terms of &lt;a href="/tags/magnesium.html">Magnesium&lt;/a>. If you get enough Magnesium in your body, it increases the benefits &lt;span>[response]&lt;/span>, the Vitamin D level in your blood stream by about 30%.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>What kind of Magnesium, because I know there’s a slow releasing Magnesium and then there’s just a regular sort of Magnesium. Do you prefer either one? Does it matter?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Actually, I’ve looked at about 10 different ones. I personally tried 6 different ones. It turns out, Magnesium is a strange critter. Many people, most people have problems with having too much Magnesium in terms of bowel problems or diarrhea. Given that, there’s still … There are some Magnesium types that are much better, have much less of that problem. Magnesium Chloride liquid is quite an inexpensive way of … that most people don’t seem to have any problem with at all. There’s another kind of Magnesium, which I’ve seen recently called Pico Magnesium in which they claim, but I’ve not seen any documentation on, that it has zero problems for people in terms of difficulties, intestinal difficulties. &lt;br>I bought that, I didn’t notice any difference myself so I’m back to the other stuff, which is 1/3 of the price.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So over-the-counter Magnesium that you can pick up off the shelf will be good enough is what you’re saying.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It appears as though over the counter stuff … If your body and your digestive system can handle it, should be just fine. There’s maybe a difference of 50% between the effectivity of the Magnesium element in your body, the bioavailability of the Magnesium element in your body, between the various Magnesium Citric, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Oxide, etc. etc. Let your body be the judge of that. To keep it very simple I have for the summary for the co-factors provided in the … I’d say &lt;strong>500 Calcium, 500 Magnesium.&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So for most people, that’s reducing the amount of Calcium down to about 500 and increasing their Magnesium up to 500. &lt;span>[milligrams of the element in each case]&lt;/span>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay and are those the two important co-factors to take to increase your Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. The Calcium is not … Changing the amount of Calcium will not affect the response level in your body but it will make things a little bit … Get extra Calcium in your arteries and things of that sort.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>So there are … The co-factors get involved in some not directly in what happens in your bloodstream but happens elsewhere in your body.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Are there any other things that … Are those the two main ones or are there other things, too?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I think the two others to be concerned about … Again, don’t deal with what happens to the Vitamin D level in your body but are good to have anyway is &lt;a href="/tags/vitamin-k2.html"> &lt;strong>Vitamin K2&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> and also Omega 3.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Do you take those as supplements or do you get those through food?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Both of those I get through supplements.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay. Now, you mentioned that you might want to decrease your Calcium that you take in. So if you’re taking say 3 glasses of milk a day, plus Vitamin D, that might be too much milk.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No, that’s not too much milk. No. Nope. Three glasses is not that much Calcium actually.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Also, what turns out to be Calcium in milk is not super bio available anyway. Some people are taking 2 grams or 3 grams a day of Calcium supplements with the idea that’s going to help their bones and we all got to be careful of that because as you increase your Vitamin D, it increases the bioavailability of the &lt;a href="/tags/calcium.html">Calcium&lt;/a>. So equivalently, if they’re taking 2 grams of Calcium and then add on some good amount of Vitamin D, that’s equivalent to taking maybe 9 or 10 or 12 grams of Calcium which gets to be a bit of an overload for the body.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Well, let’s talk a little bit about dosage. How much does that … Do you just have to go to your doctor and get your blood checked or is there some general dosing that you would recommend taking as far as Vitamin D?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>What I’m generally recommending for virtually anyone in … Who doesn’t get much direct sun on kind of a daily basis year-round. Most of the people on earth is about 4,000 IUs of Vitamin D, which is the current upper limit as to what you … What people are allowed to have in the United States without asking your doctor.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay and if you’re going outside say for 30-minute run, would that count towards your 4,000 IUs?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, yeah. Definitely. Depending on how you’re dressed and what time of day and time of year, etc. that you’re going for a nice run in the middle of the day could give you 200 IUs, could give you maybe 2,000 IUs.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>If you were a white person and not overweight, which tends to be the case, and not a senior … &lt;a href="/tags/seniors-by-the-way-get-%C2%BC-amount-of-vitamin-d.html">Seniors by-the-way get ¼ amount of Vitamin D&lt;/a> from the sun as … So I for instance get ¼ of benefit of Vitamin D than I used to when I was aged 30.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It turns out that the skin of virtually everyone on earth decreases the amount of Vitamin D, which is generated from, as you get older and older. So I’m up about ¼ of the level I used to get.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. How about people with &lt;a href="/tags/darker-skin.html">darker skin&lt;/a>? What do they need to think about?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>If they kind of think that they’ve got a permanent sunscreen on, that’s a good way of looking at it. Such that I think I saw … I remember recently that … Well, it varies with approximately 4 times longer for a person with very dark skin to get the same amount of Vitamin D than a person who’s light skinned.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. So it would probably be more important to supplement for those people.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes, it would be … I think …&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I don’t mean to say those people, what I meant to say is it’s probably more if you have darker skin, it’s more important to supplement.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes. Well, it becomes more important. IF they have a lifestyle, that’s either construction worker or something else such that they’re outdoors all the time, okay, fine. They don’t have to supplement.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>That’s … But no fair being a construction worker in Northern Alaska, they have to get some amount of sun anyway.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. How about animals, if we have pets?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yes. They tremendously like … Okay, talk about animals. The very first web page I made on Vitamin D was concerning &lt;a href="/tags/veterinaries-and-animals.html">veterinaries and animals&lt;/a>. &lt;br> It turns out that the vets learned a good decade ago that … hey - US government recommends a certain amount of Vitamin D for various animals, for cows, pigs, cats, dogs, etc. and the vets learned well over a decade ago that they get paid by keeping their patients, if you will, healthy. &lt;br>They are noticing that the amount of Vitamin D that the US government was recommending weren’t keeping their patients, cows, cats, dogs, etc. healthy. So they’ve now in general gone to 3 times the level of Vitamin D than is recommended by the US government. &lt;br>Now their animals are healthy, at least they stay alive long enough before they get killed or eaten. So I consider them advance warning as to things which are working out nicely. &lt;br>Back on cats and dogs, I’ve gotten various people around the globe who have contacted me and then tried giving their say aging dog, one was 17 years old, and it was getting kind of arthritic and kind of slow, etc. then wow, he got onto the fight of taking the Vitamin D. You figure it out per pound basis versus per kilogram basis as to how much to give to them. It was … He described it as being really giving a second life to the dog and so he lasted another 3 years. So, well into the dog years.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. Yeah. Henry, I found your website very interesting and you have it really nicely organized by different subjects. &lt;br>Aside from Vitamin D, it seems like you’re interested in a lot of health topics. Are there any other things that you’ve been looking into that my listeners might be interested in?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yeah. I’ve been looking at health topics for about 40 years. A little hard to summarize briefly.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>Would Vitamin D be the biggest thing that you’ve come across?&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Absolutely. That’s why I was saying … I say quite often that &lt;strong>if you’re going to take only a single supplement, it should be Vitamin D&lt;/strong> . There’s few other odds and ends as we’ve mentioned in this podcast that are quite useful, but … And I take a miscellaneous of their small oddments, D-Ribose for example, for restoring energy, but I don’t … &lt;br> &lt;strong>D-Ribose&lt;/strong> doesn’t give me nearly the boost that used to before I was taking Vitamin D. It’s a neat thing for … I used to do quite often after going for a long, strenuous jog, it kind of tired out. Now, okay … &lt;br>Not addressing your question directly but it’s another benefit I finally found for myself. I live in a recreational vehicle now. I travel all around the United States and I used to go off to an exercise place every-other-day to get my exercise and go out do the workout but I knew I wasn’t able to do that when I was going RV-ing because they’re just not available. I’ve ended up going to about 90 different ones throughout the United States as a day pass. So I now have a thing that I learned about 12 years ago called &lt;strong>Strength Training&lt;/strong> that it really … Put it very quickly, you do that maximum amount of output you can do in about a 2-minute period on any one of the exercises. Then you just force yourself to exhaustion on that particular thing and you go on to the next one. &lt;br>Then you do that same thing again in 2 days, same thing again in 2 days and then later on, you’re getting a little bit used to that then you do it, say in every 3 days and 4 days. Well anyway, I’m now about once every 3 weeks for doing that kind of thing. I was still finding myself being … Going to maximum output on about 30 different muscle sets or groups that I’d feel really tired that same day and the next day, it gets kind of wiped out. I said, okay, this is good for my health. &lt;strong>I’m no longer tired out.&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Is that from doing it every 3 weeks, you’re saying? You’re giving your body more recovery or what’s going on there?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No, it was a night and day thing for me that up until about 4 years ago when I started taking the Vitamin D, I would be very tired after doing that once every 3-week thing. I’ve been into that every 3 weeks now for about 10 years. So it’s a kind of a constant for me. I’d be very tired when I take that D-Ribose and it would help some but I’d still be kind of wiped out but I allowed that was, okay it’s good for me overall. &lt;strong>Since taking the Vitamin D, I’m no longer tired immediately afterwards or the next day.&lt;/strong> The next day, I don’t even notice it. So overall, it greatly benefits. I would expect, anticipate a majority of your listeners who are okay for myself, it used to be in my 30’s that’s when I’d go for a long jog, long for me, I will say is 1 ½ hour. I’d go for a long jog, I feel very tired at the end of the day. The next day, I’d kind of recuperating and kind of a week later, I’m all back to normal. Same kind I think for a marathon except a little bit longer for recovery. I don’t think I’d be doing that right now. I suspect a majority of your runners will find that the … When they get their Vitamin D level up, that they will be much better. You’ll see under the &lt;a href="/tags/sports-and-vitamin-d-review.html">Sports and Vitamin D review&lt;/a> that I have that …&lt;br> Here, I’ll just quickly list some of the documented benefits of them seen by athletes around the world with Vitamin D, &lt;br>faster reaction time,&lt;br> far fewer colds and flus in the winter, %%less sore and tired after a workout like we just talked about. &lt;br>Fewer micro cracks and broken bones, &lt;br>bones which heal far more quickly than if they do get broken. &lt;br> Increased VO2 and exercise endurance, &lt;br>anyway, so we now have professional athletes around the world giving this a try. There’s one group that’s … Hockey players for instance, this is particularly good for indoor athletes, the hockey players, which kind of almost indoor by definition. There is a group in Chicago that had been doing lousy for the last 60 years. They got … &lt;strong>Took 5,000 IUs&lt;/strong> for every one of the players and then they &lt;a href="/tags/won-the-championship-for-their-league-the-next-year.html">won the championship for their league the next year&lt;/a>. So, complete reversal, things like that. Olympic athletes have been on the sly using either UV or Vitamin D since the 1930’s from different countries. Germany and Russia had learned about that, kept that kind of a state secret for a good 30 years but that was one of the reasons that they were doing pretty well.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Is there any danger to overdosing if … You recommend around 4,000 International Units a day.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Yup.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>I’ve seen some of the … Those you can buy at the store come in as much as like 10,000 a day. Would you want to avoid that much?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Oh, no. No. I actually myself on average take 12,000 a day.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>4,000 is about the upper limit you should do without just arbitrarily unless you … More than 4,000 and you do that as a monotherapy. That is to say, the only thing you’re adding, you’re kind of unbalancing your body. You have to be taking those other co-factors. So when people take the idea and listen to this podcast, they say, “Oh, 4000 and okay, that’s fine.” If that’s the only takeaway point they have from this, I’d like to say, it’s 4,000. &lt;br>	If they’re more careful about adding one of those other factors and listing for their body, what’s going on and then you can bring it up much higher than that. That person down in Brazil that’s dealing with multiple sclerosis, he has these patients on between 20,000 and 140,000 per day. He is watching their Calcium and a few other odds and ends about that and getting this really excellent benefit.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Wow. I want to go back to something you mentioned about your weight training. You said you only do it once every 3 weeks, what’s … Is that … Do you maintain the same benefits as doing it every 2 days or every 4 days or is that just what works into your lifestyle? Why do you do it every 3 weeks?&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Henry:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>It turns out, I tried doing it every 4 weeks and that wasn’t quite &lt;span>[often]&lt;/span> enough. So I started to degrade in terms of the strength of the muscles. On average, each of the different exercises that I do of leg pushes and pull downs and well, the various fairly standard exercises, on average, I had started … When I started off, I was at a certain level and I’m now about trippled in terms of the amount of weight that I can push and do and endure. I kind of maxed out at that but apparently, if you really workout, you can do even more than 3, but 3 times level is just fine for me. I guess at a particular place I go, I’m at the maximum amount of weight plates that you can use for those particular exercises on about half of them. &lt;br>So it’s inconvenient for me to go for more because I have to go scrounge around for extra weight plates to put it on there.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Aaron:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Okay. Well Henry, it’s been very interesting talking to you and I really appreciate all the work you’ve put into your website. I hope people listening to this will check it out. I’ll definitely put up a link to it. I just wanted to say thanks so much for coming on the show and taking your time today.&lt;/td>

&lt;p>This study assessed the associations between gender, anthropometry, predominant training environment and Vitamin D status in 72 elite athletes. Additionally, any links between Vitamin D status and recent injury/health status, or sun protection practices were investigated. Athletes underwent an anthropometric assessment and provided venous blood samples for the determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), the accepted biological marker of Vitamin D status. Finally, athletes completed a questionnaire relating to their recent training and injury history, and their sun protection practices. The athlete cohort were divided by predominant training environment as either indoor, outdoor, or mixed training environment athletes. The average ( ± SD) 25(OH)D levels of the group were 111 ± 37 nmol/L, with the indoor training group (90 ± 28 nmol/L) significantly lower than the outdoor (131 ± 35 nmol/L), and mixed (133 ± 29 nmol/L) training groups (p = 0.0001).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypothesis: Less severe muscle damage if vitamin D level had been normalized</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-less-severe-muscle-damage-if-vitamin-d-level-had-been-normalized.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-less-severe-muscle-damage-if-vitamin-d-level-had-been-normalized.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">&lt;/nav></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and bicarbonate perhaps synergistically reduce muscle loss</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-bicarbonate-perhaps-synergistically-reduce-muscle-loss.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-bicarbonate-perhaps-synergistically-reduce-muscle-loss.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="could-vitamin-d-and-bicarbonate-supplementation-synergize-to-mitigate-age-related-loss-of-muscle">Could vitamin D and bicarbonate supplementation synergize to mitigate age-related loss of muscle?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>In patients with kidney disease receiving hemodialysis, metabolic acidosis is closely tied to muscle pathology and is known to exacerbate age-related loss of muscle mass and function. To a lesser extent, the &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; diet is thought to contribute to mild (sub-clinical) metabolic acidosis via the supply of acid precursors from foods &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>, but the clinical significance to chronic age-related muscle degeneration has received little attention. This may partly be due to equivocal data on the benefits of neutralizing diet-induced metabolic acidosis for improving muscle-related outcomes in patients without kidney disease &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>. Despite limited data, acidosis has been shown to stimulate muscle proteolysis and is associated with negative functional outcomes including reduced peak torque and lower gait speed &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>. This is important to note because aged adults are less able to excrete excess H? ions and are more prone to develop mild, but slowly increasing metabolic acidosis that may be exacerbated by a &amp;ldquo;Western&amp;rdquo; diet &lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup>. Furthermore, approximately one out of four adults older than 50 years of age have low serum bicarbonate levels to neutralize an acidogenic diet. Because of these factors, recommendations for future work include examining the effects of alkali therapy on functional outcomes, nitrogen balance, strength and other relevant measures of physical function, in aged healthy adults &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Muscles and Vitamin D - many studies</title><link>/posts/muscles-and-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/muscles-and-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The purpose of this 6-month randomized placebo controlled trial was to determine the effect of season-long (September-March) vitamin D supplementation on changes in vitamin D status (measured as 25(OH)D), body composition, inflammation, frequency of illness and injury. Forty-five male and female athletes were randomized to 4000IU vitamin D (n=23) or placebo (n=22). 25(OH)D, bone turnover markers (NTx and BSAP), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL1-β) were measured at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint.

&lt;p>OBJECTIVE: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is produced by the exposure of the skin to sunlight. Therefore athletes who train indoors, such as dancers, are vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in UK professional dancers during periods of reduced and increased sunlight exposure (i.e., winter vs. summer), and to assess the impact on bone metabolism and risk of injury.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Physical performance of seniors increases with vitamin D up to 30 ng</title><link>/posts/physical-performance-of-seniors-increases-with-vitamin-d-up-to-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/physical-performance-of-seniors-increases-with-vitamin-d-up-to-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-status-is-associated-with-physical-performance-the-results-of-three-independent-cohorts">Vitamin D status is associated with physical performance: the results of three independent cohorts.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide epidemic, with well known impacts on calcium metabolism and bone health, but increasingly recognized associations with chronic health problems such as bowel and colonic cancer, arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In recent years in the Sports Medicine literature, there has been an increased focus on the potential impact that inadequate Vitamin D levels may have on athletic performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>None of the female soccer players got the minimum vitamin D</title><link>/posts/none-of-the-female-soccer-players-got-the-minimum-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/none-of-the-female-soccer-players-got-the-minimum-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Nutrition Status of Junior Elite Canadian Female Soccer Athletes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Purpose: We examined the cross-sectional associations among cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), different measures of adiposity, and serum vitamin D levels in women.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: Between 2007 and 2010, 1320 women completed a health examination. Measures included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist/hip ratio, percent body fat, CRF based on a maximal treadmill exercise test, and measurement of serum vitamin D. Participants were classified by CRF as unfit (lowest 20%) and fit (remaining 80%) based on age, as well as by clinical cutoff points for adiposity measures, and by categories of serum vitamin D. We examined trends of CRF and adiposity exposures across serum vitamin D categories. We calculated odds ratios (OR) of serum vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency across levels of adiposity exposures before and after adjustment for CRF.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teenage knee injury 4X increase in last decade in Philadelphia</title><link>/posts/teenage-knee-injury-4x-increase-in-last-decade-in-philadelphia.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/teenage-knee-injury-4x-increase-in-last-decade-in-philadelphia.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="knee-injuries-on-the-rise-in-child-and-adolescent-athleteshttpmedicalxpresscomnews2011-10-knee-injuries-child-adolescent-athleteshtml">&lt;a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-10-knee-injuries-child-adolescent-athletes.html">Knee injuries on the rise in child and adolescent athletes&lt;/a>&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of different types of weight bearing physical activity on bone mineral density (BMD, g/cm(2)) and evaluate any residual benefits after the active sports career. Beginning at 17 years of age, BMD was measured 5 times, during 12 years, in 19 badminton players, 48 ice hockey players, and 25 controls. During the active career, badminton players gained significantly more BMD compared to ice hockey players at all sites: in their femoral neck (mean difference (Delta) 0.06 g/cm(2), p=0.04), humerus (Delta 0.06 g/cm(2), p=0.01), lumbar spine (Delta 0.08 g/cm(2), p=0.01), and their legs (Delta 0.05 g/cm(2), p=0.003), after adjusting for age at baseline, changes in weight, height, and active years. BMD gains in badminton players were higher also compared to in controls at all sites (Delta 0.06-0.17 g/cm(2), p&amp;lt;0.01 for all). Eleven badminton players and 37 ice hockey players stopped their active career a mean of 6 years before the final follow-up. Both these groups lost significantly more BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine compared to the control group (Delta 0.05-0.12 g/cm(2), p&amp;lt;0.05 for all).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Basketball players low on vitamin D</title><link>/posts/basketball-players-low-on-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/basketball-players-low-on-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="low-levels-of-vitamin-d-in-professional-basketball-players-after-wintertime-relationship-with-dietary-intake-of-vitamin-d-and-calcium">Low levels of vitamin D in professional basketball players after wintertime: relationship with dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D: The Injury-Prevention Vitamin&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New studies find that Vitamin D may be more important than previously thought when it comes to the health of endurance athletes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an avid cyclist and runner, I am always looking for ways to improve performance while avoiding forced time off due to injury or illness. While attending the American College of Sports Medicine meeting in Seattle last year, I heard a lecture from a well-known researcher on the benefits of vitamin D supplementation, which included increased athletic performance. I even learned about a study in which Russian and German athletes used ultraviolet sunlamps to improve performance. &lt;strong>Four Russian sprinters used UV light and another group didn’t. The two groups trained identically for the 100-meter sprint. The control group lowered its time by 1.7 percent and the UV group improved 7.4 percent.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D reduces stress fractures – review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-reduces-stress-fractures-review.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-reduces-stress-fractures-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="evaluating-the-relationship-of-calcium-and-vitamin-d-in-the-prevention-of-stress-fracture-injuries-in-the-young-athlete-a-review-of-the-literature">Evaluating the relationship of calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of stress fracture injuries in the young athlete: a review of the literature.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Calcium and vitamin D are recognized as 2 components of nutrition needed to achieve and maintain bone health. Calcium and vitamin D have been clearly shown to improve bone density and prevent fractures at all ages. However, the literature is conflicting as to the role of these nutrients in young athletes ages 18 to 35 years, both for bone development and for the prevention of bone overuse injuries. Differences in findings may relate to study design.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Story – Prevent injuries and speed healing with vitamin D</title><link>/posts/story-prevent-injuries-and-speed-healing-with-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/story-prevent-injuries-and-speed-healing-with-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="from-iehealthhttpiehealthblogspotcom201001todays-post-thursday-1-21-2010-lasthtml20-jan-2010">From &lt;a href="http://iehealth.blogspot.com/2010/01/todays-post-thursday-1-21-2010-last.html%20">IEHealth&lt;/a> Jan 2010&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Last Saturday, I spoke to a woman who broke some of her ribs when she fell off of a bicycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She saw a doctor close to where she works who is one of the pioneers in using vitamin D3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He dramatically, though for just 3 weeks, increased her vitamin D. The results may interest you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her pain stopped more than four times sooner than the doctors at the emergency room told her to expect. Then when she got an x-ray at the point when the doctors were checking to see if the progress they expected to see towards full healing, about 25% there, had happened, she was 100 % healed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Postmenopausal women with higher vitamin D exercised more</title><link>/posts/postmenopausal-women-with-higher-vitamin-d-exercised-more.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/postmenopausal-women-with-higher-vitamin-d-exercised-more.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="duration-of-physical-activity-and-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-status-of-postmenopausal-women">Duration of Physical Activity and Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D Status of Postmenopausal Women.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>A deficiency of vitamin D results in muscle weakness as well as rickets in children and osteomalacia in the adult. To study the basis for this weakness, severe vitamin D deficiency was produced in &lt;strong>rats&lt;/strong> as revealed by a low level or absence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in the serum. Vitamin D deficiency was achieved by feeding purified diets to weanlings for 16 weeks. Muscle force, peak contraction (P), time-to-half contraction (T(1/2)), time-to-peak contraction (T(P)), and time-to-half recovery (T(1/2r)) were measured. A significant reduction in muscle force was found when vitamin D deficiency was accompanied by hypophosphatemia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More than 40 ng vitamin D for Athletes</title><link>/posts/more-than-40-ng-vitamin-d-for-athletes.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/more-than-40-ng-vitamin-d-for-athletes.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-and-athletes">Vitamin D and Athletes&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Farrell, Stephen W.; Cleaver, Joseph P.; Willis, Benjamin L.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Purpose: We examined the cross-sectional associations between &lt;strong>cardiorespiratory fitness level (CRF)&lt;/strong> , different measures of adiposity, and &lt;strong>serum 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels (SVD)&lt;/strong> in men.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: 2317 men completed a baseline health examination between 2005 and 2009. Clinical measures included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (W:Hip), percent body fat (%fat), CRF quantified as duration of a maximal treadmill exercise test, and measurement of SVD. Participants were classified by CRF as &amp;lsquo;unfit&amp;rsquo; (lowest 20%) and &amp;lsquo;fit&amp;rsquo; (remaining 80%) based on age, as well as by clinical cut points for BMI, WC, W:Hip, and %fat, and by categories of SVD. We examined trends of CRF and adiposity exposures across SVD categories. We also calculated odds ratios (OR) of abnormal SVD across levels of adiposity exposures prior to and following adjustment for CRF, as well as OR of abnormal SVD across levels of CRF prior to and following adjustment for each adiposity exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Low vitamin D in teens: especially black or overweight</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-in-teens-especially-black-or-overweight.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-in-teens-especially-black-or-overweight.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="low-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-levels-in-adolescents-race-season-adiposity-physical-activity-and-fitness">Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in adolescents: race, season, adiposity, physical activity, and fitness.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D has an important role in skeletal muscles. Previously recognized for its effects on bone, it is now known that vitamin D has a much wider spectrum of usefulness for muscle. Studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency is pandemic. Those affected include the young and otherwise healthy members of the population, including athletes. Controversy exists regarding the amount of supplementation required to reverse deficiency and the relative effect of such a reversal on overall health. This article reviews current data on the role of vitamin D on muscle function, and explores the potential implications of its deficiency and supplementation on physical fitness and athletic performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D improving muscles may be due to improving phosphate levels</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-improving-muscles-may-be-due-to-improving-phosphate-levels.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-improving-muscles-may-be-due-to-improving-phosphate-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hypophosphatemia-is-responsible-for-skeletal-muscle-weakness-of-vitamin-d-deficiency">Hypophosphatemia is responsible for skeletal muscle weakness of vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>A deficiency of vitamin D results in muscle weakness as well as rickets in children and osteomalacia in the adult. To study the basis for this weakness, severe vitamin D deficiency was produced in &lt;strong>rats&lt;/strong> as revealed by a low level or absence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in the serum. Vitamin D deficiency was achieved by feeding purified diets to weanlings for 16 weeks. Muscle force, peak contraction (P), time-to-half contraction (T(1/2)), time-to-peak contraction (T(P)), and time-to-half recovery (T(1/2r)) were measured.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Olympic Athletes and vitamin D - clippings 2009-10</title><link>/posts/olympic-athletes-and-vitamin-d-clippings-2009-10.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/olympic-athletes-and-vitamin-d-clippings-2009-10.html</guid><description>&lt;p>05/13/2009&lt;/p>

&lt;p>According to a paper published in The American College of Sports Medicine, vitamin D may give American athletes an advantage in the 2012 Olympics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The paper, “Athletic Performance and Vitamin D,” says vitamin D—which improves reaction time, muscle strength, speed and endurance—may give Americans the same edge that Russian and German athletes received in the 1950s and 1980s, when they used sunlamps to stimulate vitamin D production to increase performance and reduce injuries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Professional sports team takes 5000 IU vitamin D and wins championship</title><link>/posts/professional-sports-team-takes-5000-iu-vitamin-d-and-wins-championship.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/professional-sports-team-takes-5000-iu-vitamin-d-and-wins-championship.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>More muscle response when have adequate vitamin D</title><link>/posts/more-muscle-response-when-have-adequate-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/more-muscle-response-when-have-adequate-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="an-excellent-study-showed-why-vitamin-d-helps-muscle-response">An excellent study showed why vitamin D helps muscle response.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>PURPOSE:: Activated vitamin D (calcitriol) is a pluripotent pleiotropic secosteroid hormone. As a steroid hormone, which regulates more than 1000 vitamin D-responsive human genes, calcitriol may influence athletic performance. Recent research indicates that intracellular calcitriol levels in numerous human tissues, including nerve and muscle tissue, are increased when inputs of its substrate, the prehormone vitamin D, are increased.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Muscle strength in youth increased with 60,000 IU vitamin D per week and 1 g Calcium</title><link>/posts/muscle-strength-in-youth-increased-with-60000-iu-vitamin-d-per-week-and-1-g-calcium.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/muscle-strength-in-youth-increased-with-60000-iu-vitamin-d-per-week-and-1-g-calcium.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-cholecalciferol-and-calcium-supplementation-on-muscle-strength-and-energy-metabolism-in-vitamin-d-deficient-asian-indians-a-randomized-controlled-trial">Effect of cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation on muscle strength and energy metabolism in vitamin D deficient Asian Indians: A randomized controlled trial.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>ANAHEIMAlthough &lt;a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamind.asp">vitamin D&lt;/a>insufficiency has reached what might be considered epidemic proportions, it’s failed to move onto the radar screens of most physicians, much less consumers. A host of new studies now link excess weight with a deficiency in this, the sunshine vitamin. But that wouldn’t explain why female soldiers become increasing D-ficient during basic combat training. For them, an Army study suggests, the problem may trace to what they wear.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels dropped after training for white, but not black females</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-dropped-after-training-for-white-but-not-black-females.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-dropped-after-training-for-white-but-not-black-females.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Vit D associated with less muscle fat</title><link>/posts/vit-d-associated-with-less-muscle-fat.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vit-d-associated-with-less-muscle-fat.html</guid><description>&lt;p>J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2010 Feb 17. &lt;span>[Epub ahead of print]&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
