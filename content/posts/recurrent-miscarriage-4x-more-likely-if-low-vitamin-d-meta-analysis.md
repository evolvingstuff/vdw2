Problem: Previous studies had shown that there might be an association between serum vitamin D concentrations and the occurrence of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). However, the conclusions remained controversial. The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence for an epidemiological association between vitamin D and RSA.

Method of study: The literature search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Chinese databases. The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity. Effect sizes were calculated using fixed or random effects models, including standardized mean difference (SMD), odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Then we performed subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis.

Results: Fourteen studies from five countries were included. Based on the results, patients with RSA had lower vitamin D levels than controls (SMD = -1.48, 95%CI: -2.01, -0.94, P<0.001), and pregnant women with vitamin D deficiency (VDD) had a higher risk of developing RSA ( **OR = 4.02** , 95%CI: 2.23, 7.25, P<0.001). There was remarkable heterogeneity between studies (I2 SMD = 97.3%, P<0.001; I2 OR = 82.2%, P<0.001). 

The results of the subgroup analysis suggested that heterogeneity may be caused by the assay method, age and region. Sensitivity analysis showed the analysis results were robust.

Conclusion: Patients with RSA had lower serum vitamin D levels than normal pregnant women, and pregnant women with VDD might be at higher risk for RSA.

#### 95% of miscarriages in Iraq were associated with low vitamin D - July 2022

 **The relationship between vitamin D and spontaneous abortion among Iraqi women** 

J Med Life. 2022 Jun;15(6):757-761 [doi: 10.25122/jml-2021-0266.](https://doi.org/10.25122/jml-2021-0266.)

Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency is a prevalent concern among women of reproductive age, particularly in the Arab world, where the link between vitamin D deficiency and miscarriage is still unknown. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between vitamin D and miscarriage by comparing the concentration of vitamin D among women with spontaneous abortion and pregnant women. A total of 80 subjects were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups. The first group included 40 women with spontaneous abortions aged between 18 and 40 years. The second group included 40 pregnant women without previous history of miscarriages. Total 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-VD) measurement was estimated with a Dry Fluorescence Immunoassay analyzer using the Lansionbio LS-1100 instrument. The relationship between the five age groups and the vitamin D status of women with spontaneous abortion was not significant (p>0.05). There was no significant relationship between the miscarriage trimesters and vitamin D status (p>0.05) and between the five age groups (p>0.05). In our study, 95% of women with spontaneous abortion had vitamin D deficiency, compared to only 17.5% of pregnant women. A normal range of vitamin D improves the growth of the fetus and prevents pregnancy complications and miscarriage, promoting the growth of blood vessels in the placenta and improving the function of immune cells.
