### A lot of baking used to use lard which often had [500 IU of vitamin D per teaspoon](/tags/500-iu-of-vitamin-d-per-teaspoon.html)

Pies, cookies, pastry, short bread, biskets, shepards pie, etc.

### A slice of pie might have had 3,000 IU of vitamin D

9 inch pie 1 cup shortening,  1 cup = 48 teaspoons

500 IU of vitamin D per teaspoon of "free range lard"

24,000 IU per entire 9" pie. 8 slices per pie, so  **3,000 IU per slice** 

Note: can really be any type of pie (pumpkin, etc), the important ingredient is the free range lard
