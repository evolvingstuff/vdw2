* Genetic tests look for the virus’s RNA in a nose or throat swab, or in saliva samples. 

   * The most common type is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

* Antigen tests look for specific proteins on the surface of the virus.

* Antibody tests are blood tests that look for signs that a person has had an infection with the virus and had an immune response. These aren’t used to diagnose an active infection.

Although  **antigen tests**  are faster and the number of tests being run can be easily scaled up, they have a high false-negative rate — with as many as half of negative results inaccurate. - Aug 26
