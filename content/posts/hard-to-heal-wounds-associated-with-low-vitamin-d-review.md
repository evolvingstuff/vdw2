 **Wound healing often needs some combination of:  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vitamin D - (nanoemulsion works very well)  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vitamin D - non-daily  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resveratrol or something to improve the vitamin D receptor  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Omega-3   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Topical   
&nbsp;  
This review appears to only consider daily oral Vitamin D mono-therapy**
