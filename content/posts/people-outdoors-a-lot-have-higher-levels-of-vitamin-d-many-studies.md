#### Outdoor workers: NHANES 2001-2014

 **The unique association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and blood lipid profiles in agriculture, forestry, and fishing occupations: Insights from NHANES 2001-2014** 

PLoS One. 2024 Feb 27;19(2):e0297873. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0297873.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0297873.) eCollection 2024.

Background: The relationship of serum 25(OH)D levels and hyperlipidemia has not been explored in the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AFF) occupation. We aimed to explore the impact of serum 25(OH)D levels on lipid profiles in AFF workers, traffic drivers, and miners.

Methods: Data from 3937 adults aged 18-65 years old with completed information were obtained from the National Health and Examination Survey from 2001 to 2014. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL-C/LDL-C ratio. Subgroup analyses for AFF workers considered age, sex, BMI, work activity, months worked, and alcohol consumption. Non-linear relationships were explored using curve fitting.

Results: Serum 25(OH)D levels differed between groups (AFF: 60.0 ± 21.3 nmol/L, drivers: 56.6 ± 22.2 nmol/L, miners: 62.8 ± 22.3 nmol/L). Subgroup analysis of the AFF group showed that participants with serum 25(OH)D ≥50 nmol/L, females, and BMI <30 kg/m2 demonstrated improved HDL-C levels correlating with higher serum 25(OH)D. Serum 25(OH)D in AFF workers had a reversed U-shaped relationship with TG and TC, and a U-shaped relationship with HDL-C, with HDL-C, with inflection points at 49.5 nmol/L for TG and TC, and 32.6 nmol/L for HDL-C.

Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with lipid profiles, and the relationship varies among occupational groups. AFF workers, facing unique occupational challenges, may benefit from maintaining adequate serum 25(OH)D levels to mitigate adverse lipid profiles and reduce cardiovascular risk.
