#### [Garlic Powder to Lower Lead Levels](https://nutritionfacts.org/2020/09/10/garlic-powder-to-lower-lead-levels/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&utm_campaign=42fe1bb160-RSS_BLOG_DAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-42fe1bb160-25209481&mc_cid=42fe1bb160&mc_eid=b95641625a) Dr. Greger Sept 2020

 **5 minute video and excellent text transcript, which includes** 

* “All higher plants possess the capacity to synthesize compounds that bind up heavy metals to protect themselves from the harmful effects, so what if we ate the plants? “”

* “…feeding garlic to chickens reduced lead levels in the “edible mass of chicken” by up to 75 percent or more.”

* “What’s even more astonishing is that when researchers gave them the same amount of lead—but this time waited a week before giving them the garlic—it worked even better. “The value of garlic in reducing lead concentrations…was more pronounced when garlic was given as a post-treatment following the cessation of lead administration”—that is, after the lead was stopped and had already built up in their tissues.”
