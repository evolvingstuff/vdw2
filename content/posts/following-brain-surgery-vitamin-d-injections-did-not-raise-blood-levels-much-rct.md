300,000 IU injection only raised blood levels from 16 ng ==> 23 ng

Generally no benefit is found in any kind of study when blood levels are less than 30 ng

Oral vitamin D is about 20X less expensive and results in 5X faster response - wonder why they used injection

* [Vitamin D injection of 600,000 IU (response by 10 individuals)– Sept 2017](/posts/vitamin-d-injection-of-600000-iu-response-by-10-individuals) 

   * 4 - 12 weeks for injection to peak.  

   * Doubt that the surgery patients were given the injection more than a week before the surgery

   * all 10 started with a much higher level of vitamin D than the brain surgery patients

* previous report on this study:

   * [300,000 IU Vitamin D injection before brain tumor surgery – RCT to finish Dec 2017](/posts/300000-iu-vitamin-d-injection-before-brain-tumor-surgery-rct-to-finish)

 **VitaminDWiki suggests** 

One dose a week before the surgery

The second dose just after the surgery

Doses can probably be oral – no indication that injection is better

&nbsp; &nbsp; Injection might actually be worse for surgery due to slower response
