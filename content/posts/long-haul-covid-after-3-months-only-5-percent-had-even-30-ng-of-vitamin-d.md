#### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients attending Post COVID-19 follow-up clinic: a cross-sectional study

Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci . 2022 Apr;26(8):3038-3045. [doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202204_28635.](https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202204_28635.)

Objective: Post-COVID-19 syndrome appears to be a multi-organ illness with a broad spectrum of manifestations, occurring after even mild acute illness. Limited data currently available has suggested that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in COVID-19 cases. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in post-COVID-19 cases and its effect on the symptom severity. The aim of this study is to both screen the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in post-COVID-19 syndrome patients and to study its relation to persistent symptoms.

Patients and methods: A cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted involving all cases attending post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic from November 2020 to May 2021. Complete history, clinical examination, and laboratory analysis <span>[kidney functions, serum calcium, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, Serum 25-(OH) vitamin D]</span> was done as well as HRCT chest.

Results: The study included 219 post-COVID-19 cases, 84% had deficient vitamin D levels (< 20 ng/dL); 11.4% had insufficient level (20-30 ng/dL) and only  **4.9 % reported normal level** . There was no link between levels of vitamin D with either the acute or post-COVID-19 symptoms in the studied groups.

Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among the study population, no association was observed between the levels of vitamin D and post-COVID-19 symptoms. It appears that post-COVID-19 syndrome pathophysiology involves a more complex interaction with the immune system. Dedicated clinical trials are advised to better study vitamin D levels and the related disease severity in COVID-19 patients.

#### Opinion: Long-Haul needs both high dose vitamin D and re-activation of the Vitamin D Receptor

* SARS-COV2 protects itself from Vitamin D by switching off the the Vitamin D Receptor

* When SARS-COV2 goes away, it fails to turn the Vitamin D Receptor back on

* A deactivated VDR leaves the cells with extremely low levels of vitamin D - which allows Epstein-Barr virus, etc to come out of hiding.
