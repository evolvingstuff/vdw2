* Made reference to a previous study  
[10X increase in interferon when body is heaterd to 39 degrees celsius](https://youtu.be/HxMEYtKYdZM?t=4931)

 **Notes:  
1) Tthe immune system kicks in when the core body temperature exceeds 39 degrees  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; - which rarely happens wihout a sauna, hot tub, or fever  &nbsp; &nbsp; (39 C = 102.2 F)  
 2) 8-30 grams of aspirin used during Spanish flu reduced Vitamin C   
&nbsp; &nbsp; long term use of Aspirin can cause intestinal bleeding, so now vitamin C is included in some aspirin capsules**
