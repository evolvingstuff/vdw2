Objective: To investigate the effects of vitamin D drops on immune function in children with recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTI).

Methods: The clinical data of 119 children with RRTI in our hospital were retrospectively retrieved, and they were divided into group A (n=59, receiving routine treatment) and group B (n=60, receiving vitamin D drops) based on their treatment modality. The clinical efficacy, symptom disappearance time, immune function index, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25-(OH)D3]</span>, serum y-interferon (INF-y), and the number of episodes of respiratory tract infections were compared between the two groups.

Results: The total effective rate of treatment in group B was 96.67%, which was significantly higher than 71.19% in group A (P<0.05). 

Children in group B had shorter time to disappearance of lung rales, cough, and fever than group A (P<0.05).

Group B had higher IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, higher CD4+, CD3+ levels and lower CD8+ levels as well as higher IGF-1, 25-(OH)D3, INF-y levels, and fewer respiratory infections after treatment than group A (P<0.05).

Conclusion: Vitamin D drops are effective in the treatment of children with RRTI, which is beneficial to the improvement of clinical symptoms and immune function.

Group A: After admission, patients were given supportive therapy such as supplemental oxygen, cough suppressants, asthma and expectoration treatment according to their condition.

Group B: Vitamin D drops (H20113033, Qingdao Shuangjing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 400 units * 10 tablets * 3 tablets) were taken orally at q.d 800 U. Twenty days of medication and 10 days without in every 30 consecutive days were a course of treatment, and a total of 3 courses were performed.
