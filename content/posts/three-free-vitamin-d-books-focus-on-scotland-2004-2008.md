# Summary from the introduction to the book

People living in Scotland have a lower average level of vitamin D in their bodies than people in England and a higher incidence of several common chronic diseases.  The difference in vitamin D levels is a result of Scotland’s northerly location, which allows less opportunity for exposure of the skin to sunlight. A healthy person in Europe or North America obtains more than 90% of their vitamin D by exposure of skin to the sun. The low levels of vitamin D in the Scottish population can explain, at least in part, the higher levels of certain chronic diseases and the higher death rates found in Scotland compared to England and most other Western European countries.

While health has been improving in Scotland, the advance is not as fast as in other European countries, and at the present rate Scotland will never catch up. This report calls for urgent action by Scotland’s government to take new measures that will give the country its best chance of improving health and of catching up with other European countries that have more favourable climates.

Insufficient vitamin D is an important factor increasing the risk or severity of several chronic diseases including several cancers, heart disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, high blood pressure, diabetes (types 1 and 2), and arthritis as well as bone disease and fractures that frequently lead to death in old people. Most of these, and certain other ills, occur more frequently in Scotland compared with England – a difference that may be accounted for large- ly by the difference in available sunlight between the two countries. Looking at multiple sclerosis alone, Scotland has a higher percentage of sufferers than any other country in the world, and the second highest percentage for Crohn’s disease.

However successive reports on the state of Scottish health have failed to recognise that insufficient sunlight and vitamin D are important risk factors for health in Scotland. The purpose of this book is to draw attention to this gap and show how major gains in Scottish health can be expected from relatively simple preventive measures.

Multiple sclerosis, diabetes type 1, and Crohn’s disease are autoimmune diseases which have become much more common in Scotland during the last 30 years or more. It is no exaggeration to say that Scotland is in the grip of a serious epidemic of autoimmune disease. Similar increases are occurring in other countries but the epidemic appears to be more extensive in Scotland than elsewhere and may be caused in large part by insufficient vitamin D.

The vitamin D status of the Scottish population could be boosted by making supplements available cheaply and/or by fortifying food with vitamin D. A relatively small investment might reduce personal misery of very large numbers of people as well as save large sums presently spent on illness and disability in Scotland. The problem of vitamin D insufficiency requires the same urgent attention from government as smoking, alcoholism or obesity.

Vitamin D status can be improved without the personal denial or discipline needed by smokers, drinkers, or dieters who attempt to give up cigarettes, or reduce alcohol or food intake. The principal factor preventing improvement in vitamin D levels at present is lack of government action in facilitating the availability of vitamin D supplements together with lack of knowledge of the problem among health professionals and the public.

Mistaken advice from government in London and from Cancer Research UK to avoid exposure to the sun between 11am and 3pm can only have pushed down average levels of vitamin D in the past. Official advice needs to be brought up to date so that the public is encouraged to sunbathe without burning, since burning appears to be the major risk factor for skin cancer rather than sun exposure itself.
