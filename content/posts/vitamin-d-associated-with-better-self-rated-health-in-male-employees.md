While low vitamin D status has been shown to be associated with decreased quality

of life in unhealthy populations and women, only limited data are available regarding healthy

adult men. Our aim was to evaluate the associations between health-related quality of life (QoL)

and vitamin D status in adult men. High-tech employees aged 25–65 year were recruited from

an occupational periodic examination clinic at Rambam Health Campus. QoL was assessed using

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health-related quality of life questionnaire

(HRQOL-4). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and Body Mass Index (BMI) were measured;

further information was collected about physical activity, education, sun exposure, sick-days, and

musculoskeletal pain severity (visual analog scale). Three hundred and fifty-eight men were

enrolled in the study; mean serum 25(OH)D level was 22.1 ˘ 7.9 ng/mL (range 4.6–54.5 ng/mL).

In a multivariate logistic regression model, 25(OH)D was a significant independent determinant

of self-rated health; Odds Ratio (OR) for self-rated health was 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI)

0.85–0.97, p = 0.004), adjusted for age, BMI, pain severity, physical activity, and sun exposure.

Every 1 ng/mL increase of 25(OH)D was associated with 9% reduction in the odds of reporting

self-rated health as fair or poor. Poisson regression model demonstrated an association between

physically unhealthy days and 25(OH)D levels (rate ratio 0.95, p < 0.001). In conclusion, serum levels

of 25(OH)D were associated with self-rated health and with physically unhealthy days of HRQOL

in healthy high-tech male workers. Future intervention studies are required to test the impact of

vitamin D supplementation on QoL.
