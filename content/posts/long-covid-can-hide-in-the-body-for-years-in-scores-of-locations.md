Millions of people are suffering from Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Several biological factors have emerged as potential drivers of PASC pathology. Some individuals with PASC may not fully clear the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 after acute infection. Instead, replicating virus and/or viral RNA—potentially capable of being translated to produce viral proteins—persist in tissue as a ‘reservoir’. This reservoir could modulate host immune responses or release viral proteins into the circulation. Here we review studies that have identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA/protein or immune responses indicative of a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC samples. Mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir may contribute to PASC pathology, including coagulation, microbiome and neuroimmune abnormalities, are delineated. We identify research priorities to guide the further study of a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC, with the goal that clinical trials of antivirals or other therapeutics with potential to clear a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir are accelerated.

##### Research suggesions

 **Major areas of opportunity for research into a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC** 

* Which PASC cell and tissue types harbor SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein? 

   * Is there a preference for persistence in certain cell or tissue types?

* Is SARS-CoV-2 RNA identified in PASC samples transcriptionally active, translating, replicating or infectious?

* Is the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir sufficient to drive PASC symptoms? 

   * Are SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins also identified in samples collected from post-COVID-19 individuals without PASC? 

   * If yes, what factors differentiate SARS-CoV-2 persistence in PASC from persistence in asymptomatic individuals?

* Do particular classes of symptoms tend to be driven by the location of the reservoir—for example, dyspnea from a lung reservoir or gastrointestinal symptoms from a gut reservoir?

* Do measurements of SARS-CoV-2 protein or antibody responses in body fluids correlate with SARS-COV-2 persistence in tissue?

* Can the transcriptional program of circulating immune cells be used as a biosensor of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in tissue?

* Does T cell exhaustion correlate with SARS-CoV-2 persistence in PASC?

* Are neutralizing antibody responses qualitatively different in patients with PASC?

* By what mechanisms can SARS-CoV-2 evade immune detection? 

   * Do such mechanisms differ by cell or tissue type, or by viral variant? 

   * Do viral mutations and selection contribute to persistence?

* Can the spike protein travel via EVs into the bloodstream?

* Does a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir or protein contribute to fibrin/ amyloid microclotting, platelet activation or related vasculature issues in PASC?

* Does a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC correlate with the reactivation of other pathogens such as herpesviruses?

* Does a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC correlate with changes in human endogenous retrovirus activity?

* Can a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir alter the local transcriptome or epigenome?

* Does a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir in PASC correlate with the disruption of microbiome composition or activity?

   * If so, is disruption a cause or consequence of PASC?

* Is a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir associated with host epithelial barrier breakdown in PASC? 

   * Does this facilitate the translocation viral protein or bacterial/fungal organisms into blood?

* Can SARS-CoV-2 persistence or the reactivation of other latent pathogens lead to cross-reactive antibody responses in PASC blood or tissue?
