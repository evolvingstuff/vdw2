 **Giving Folic Acid before 2,000 births would reduce** 

* 1 Spina Bifida birth

* 100 preterm births

Note: Premature Birth is the biggest cause the death for children age 0 - 5 years.

Similar lifetime cost (about $700,000 ) of a premature birth and a Spina bifida birth

 **But 100X more bad birth outcomes could be prevented by Vitamin D than by Folic Acid**

Folic Acid increases Breast Cancer risk by 20%

Folic Acid increases colorectal cancer by 35%

Folic Acid increases  risk of childhood asthma by 26%

Folic Acid 43% more likely to die from cancer.

Folic Acid, then 30 years later twice as likely to die from breast cancer

“However, it is estimated that only 15 to 25 percent of folic acid–preventable spina bifida and anencephaly worldwide is being prevented through folic acid supplementation and food fortification programs”

the correct form of what your body needs is  **folate** 

While folic acid can be converted by the body to a usable form of folate, the conversion process is limited and this frequently leads to excessive levels of unmetabolized folic acid in the blood (this is unhealthy). Furthermore – and incredibly importantly –  **folic acid cannot cross the placenta to the foetus, the way natural folate can** .

Folic acid does prevent neural tube defects, but doesn’t have the other beneficial effects of natural folate.
