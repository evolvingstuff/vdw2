The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) affects the expression and regulation of numerous genes across the genome. Here are some key genes and gene families influenced by VDR:

1. CYP24A1: This gene encodes the enzyme responsible for vitamin D catabolism. VDR strongly upregulates  **<a href="/posts/cyp24a1-gene-and-vitamin-d-many-studies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: CYP24A1 gene and Vitamin D - many studies">CYP24A1</a>**  expression as part of a negative feedback loop to control vitamin D levels.

1. CAMP (Cathelicidin Antimicrobial Peptide): VDR induces expression of this gene, which plays a crucial role in innate immunity and antimicrobial defense.

1. Calcium transport genes: VDR regulates genes involved in calcium homeostasis, including calcium-binding proteins like calbindin, <span>[Lung Cancer risk increases if low Vitamin D, poor activation of Vitamin D Receptor which affects the CALB1 gene – June 2024]</span> and calcium channel proteins.

1. Bone metabolism genes: VDR influences genes involved in bone formation and resorption, such as osteocalcin (BGLAP) and osteopontin (SPP1).

1. Cell cycle regulators: VDR can modulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, including p21 and p27.

1. Immune system genes: VDR affects various genes involved in immune function, including  **cytokines**  and their receptors.

1. Renin-angiotensin system genes: VDR has been shown to regulate renin gene expression, influencing  **blood pressure control** .

1. Detoxification genes: VDR regulates genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as **<a href="/posts/changes-in-cyp3a4-gene-affects-vitamin-d-health-reactions-to-some-drugs-etc" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Changes in CYP3A4 gene affects Vitamin D, health, reactions to some drugs, etc - June 2022">CYP3A4</a>** .

1. Epigenetic modifiers: VDR can influence the expression of genes involved in  **<a href="/posts/epigenetics-and-vitamin-d-many-studies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Epigenetics and Vitamin D – many studies">epigenetic</a> regulation** , potentially affecting a wide range of cellular processes.

1. Tumor suppressor genes: In some contexts, VDR can regulate genes involved in  **cancer prevention and progression.** 

It's important to note that the specific genes affected by VDR can vary depending on cell type, tissue context, and physiological conditions. 

The VDR is estimated to regulate about  **3-5% of the human genome** , potentially influencing thousands of genes directly or indirectly. 

The complex interplay between VDR, its target genes, and various environmental and genetic factors contributes to the wide-ranging effects of vitamin D in the body

The Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) affects the expression and regulation of numerous genes across the genome. Here are some key genes and gene families influenced by VDR:
#CYP24A1: This gene encodes the enzyme responsible for vitamin D catabolism. VDR strongly upregulates __((CYP24A1 gene and Vitamin D - many studies|CYP24A1))__ expression as part of a negative feedback loop to control vitamin D levels.
#CAMP (Cathelicidin Antimicrobial Peptide): VDR induces expression of this gene, which plays a crucial role in innate immunity and antimicrobial defense.
#Calcium transport genes: VDR regulates genes involved in calcium homeostasis, including calcium-binding proteins like calbindin, [Lung Cancer risk increases if low Vitamin D, poor activation of Vitamin D Receptor which affects the CALB1 gene – June 2024|CALB1] and calcium channel proteins.
#Bone metabolism genes: VDR influences genes involved in bone formation and resorption, such as osteocalcin (BGLAP) and osteopontin (SPP1).
#Cell cycle regulators: VDR can modulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, including p21 and p27.
#Immune system genes: VDR affects various genes involved in immune function, including __cytokines__ and their receptors.
#Renin-angiotensin system genes: VDR has been shown to regulate renin gene expression, influencing __blood pressure control__.
#Detoxification genes: VDR regulates genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, such as__ ((Changes in CYP3A4 gene affects Vitamin D, health, reactions to some drugs, etc - June 2022|CYP3A4))__.
#Epigenetic modifiers: VDR can influence the expression of genes involved in __((Epigenetics and Vitamin D – many studies|epigenetic)) regulation__, potentially affecting a wide range of cellular processes.
#Tumor suppressor genes: In some contexts, VDR can regulate genes involved in __cancer prevention and progression.__
It&#39;s important to note that the specific genes affected by VDR can vary depending on cell type, tissue context, and physiological conditions. 
The VDR is estimated to regulate about __3-5% of the human genome__, potentially influencing thousands of genes directly or indirectly. 
The complex interplay between VDR, its target genes, and various environmental and genetic factors contributes to the wide-ranging effects of vitamin D in the body
