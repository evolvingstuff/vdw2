Today, we’re going to talk about vitamin D deficiency and some things you’ve probably never heard about vitamin D. 

 **Vitamin D deficiency can cause:** 

* A compromised immune system 

* Inflammation 

* Sleep issues

* Digestive problems 

 **Causes of vitamin D deficiency:** 

* Gut inflammation 

* Missing gallbladder

* Thicker skin

* Darker skin 

* Obesity

* Diabetes

* Insulin resistance

* Location (living further from the equator)

* Problems with certain genes

* Infection

* Fatty liver

* Smoking

* Sugar

* Stress

* Statins

* Low-fat diets

* Pollution

* Omega-6 fatty acids 

It’s almost impossible to get vitamin D from your diet, so you need to take certain measures to avoid becoming vitamin D deficient. Important things you may have never learned about vitamin D: 

* 1. Most side effects that occur after taking vitamin D could be caused by a magnesium deficiency. 

* 2. Infrequent large doses of vitamin D may be better than small daily doses. 

* 3. Farm-raised fish have four times less vitamin D than wild-caught fish, and grain-fed animals have less vitamin D than grass-fed animals. Chickens and pigs that roam outside have more vitamin D than those confined indoors. 

* 4. Vitamin D3 is the third biggest factor that improves overall health. 

* 5. Vitamin D2 is very different from vitamin D3 and may inhibit the absorption of vitamin D3 and worsen MS. It’s also not effective to help with lupus or to decrease mortality, whereas vitamin D3 may be effective in these situations.

* 6. Ten minutes of skin exposure to the sun only provides about 400 IU of vitamin D. 

* 7. Most vitamin D3 supplements in Europe (and possibly around the world) contain corn syrup.
