The objective was to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women. Blood samples were taken from 154 African-American, 194 Hispanic, and 146 Caucasian women at <14 weeks of gestation; 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mean 25(OH)D levels in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women were 15.5 ± 7.2 (standard deviation), 24.1 ± 8.7, 29.0 ± 8.5 ng/mL, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of African-Americans, 81% of Hispanics, and 67% of Caucasians were deficient (25(OH)D levels <20 ng/mL or <50 nmol/L) or insufficient (25(OH)D levels ? 20 ng/mL or <32 ng/mL or ? 50 nmol/L or <80 nmol/L). Of these pregnant women, 82% had vitamin D levels <32 ng/mL (<80 ng/mL). In logistic regression models, race was the most important risk factor for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. African-American women and Hispanic women were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency than Caucasian women. Furthermore, primigravid women were more at risk for vitamin D insufficiency. This study demonstrates widespread vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in pregnant females living at a southern latitude. African-Americans are at greatest risk.

## Snapshot from April 2011: Overview Moms babies and vitamin D = Vitamin D: Before, During, and After Pregnancy

^The more vitamin D the mother takes, the more benefits for the future child. 

* The maternal benefits have not been proven to start until an average daily dose of 2,000 IU 

* The benefits accumulate as the vitamin D dose level is raised

* It costs only $12 per year to take an average of 2,000 IU of vitamin D

* Taking 4,000 or 6,000 IU raises the cost, due to cost of co-factors and blood test (price of test ranges from $0 to $200)

* There have been some clinical trials with 6,000 IU, and more are in progress
