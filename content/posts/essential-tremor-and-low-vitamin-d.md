**Suggestions as to what to try for ET as of Nov 2023** 

1. High-dose vitamin D to get past likely poor Vitamin D Receptor genes

   * Take at least 300,000 IU within a week and see if the ET greatly decreases

   * [Topical Vitamin D](/posts/topical-vitamin-d) would be the best form, 

   * &nbsp; &nbsp; as it bypasses the liver, kidney and any Vitamin D Binding protein problem

1. B vitamins, especially B12, might also help

1. Activators of the [Vitamin D Receptor](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor) might also help

Wondering about this topic after learning that <a href="/posts/raynauds-syndrome" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2729">Raynaud's Syndrome</a> was reduced with vitamin D

Just realized that after taking vitamin D both my Raynaud's pain and Essential Tremors have gone away

#### ET associated with poor vitamin D binding gene - March 2022

 **Vitamin D Receptor and Binding Protein Gene Variants in Patients with Essential Tremor** 

Mol Neurobiol . 2022 Mar 24. [doi: 10.1007/s12035-022-02804-8](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-022-02804-8)

José A G Agúndez 1, Elena García-Martín 1, Hortensia Alonso-Navarro 2, Christopher Rodríguez 1, Mónica Díez-Fairén 3 4, Ignacio Álvarez 3 4, Pau Pastor 3 4, Julián Benito-León 5 6, Tomás López-Alburquerque 7, Félix Javier Jiménez-Jiménez 8 9

Several studies have shown an association between some variants in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the GC vitamin D binding protein (GC) genes with the risk for Parkinson's disease or other neurological disorders. VDR rs2228570 has shown an association with essential tremor (ET) in a previous study. The aim of this study is to look for the association between several common variants in these genes and the risk for ET. We genotyped 272 patients diagnosed with familial ET and 272 age-matched controls using specific TaqMan assays for VDR rs2228570, VDR rs731236, VDR rs7975232, VDR rs739837, VDR rs78783628, GC rs7041, and GC rs4588 single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We found an association between GC rs7041 SNV and ET using recessive, codominant, and allelic models. 

Despite our results  **did not find an association between VDR rs2228570 and ET** , the pooled data with those by a previous report suggest this association under recessive, codominant, and allelic models. None of the SNVs studied was related to the age at onset of tremor in ET patients. Data from the current study suggest an association between GC rs7041 and VDR rs2228570 SNVs and ET risk.

#### Vitamin D and Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders: A Systematic Review - Aug 2020

Tremor Other Hyperkinet Mov (N Y). 2020; 10: 32.  [doi: 10.5334/tohm.74](https://doi.org/10.5334/tohm.74)

Carl N. Homann, MD, PhD,1,2 Gerd Ivanic, MD,3 Barbara Homann,1 and Tadeja Urbanic Purkart, MD1

Background:

The importance of vitamin D deficiency in Parkinson’s disease, its negative influence on bone health, and even disease pathogenesis has been studied intensively. However, despite its possible severe impact on health and quality of life, there is not a sufficient understanding of its role in other movement disorders. This systematic review aims at providing an overview of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, bone metabolism alterations, and fractures in each of the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders (HKMDs).

Methods:

The study search was conducted through PubMed with keywords or Medical Related Subjects (MeSH) of common HKMDs linked with the terms of vitamin D, osteoporosis, injuries, and fractures.

Results:

Out of 1585 studies screened 40 were included in our review. 

They show that there is evidence that several HKMDs, including 

* Huntington disease, 

* Restless Legs Syndrome, and 

* tremor,

are associated with low vitamin D serum levels in up to 83% and 89% of patients. Reduced bone mineral density associated with vitamin D insufficiency was described in Huntington disease.

Discussion:

Our survey suggests that vitamin D deficiency, bone structure changes, and fractures are important but yet under-investigated issues in HKMDs. HKMDs-patients, particularly with a history of previous falls, should have their vitamin D-levels tested and supplemented where appropriate.

Highlights:

Contrary to Parkinson’s disease, vitamin D deficiency, and bone abnormalities are under-investigated in hyperkinetic movement disorders (HKMDs). Several HKMDs, including essential tremor, RLS, and Huntington disease, are associated with vitamin D deficiency in up to 89%, the latter also with reduced bone mineral density. Testing and where appropriate supplementation is recommended.

### Examples from 2013

* [MD Junction](http://www.mdjunction.com/forums/essential-tremor-discussions/introductions-personal-stories/2218218-essential-tremor-and-vitamin-d)

> individual totally eliminated her ET with Vitamin D

> Another person commented: Just remember that tremors are a side effect of low vit D. But it is truley a different illness than ET. If a large daily does of vit D resolves your tremors over time. you may not have ET. It may just be a Vit D issue. Alcoholics are most know for the low vit D do to the amount of alcohol they consume in a day. good luck all
