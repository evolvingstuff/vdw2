&lt;p>During pregnancy, maternal and fetal Ca demands are met through increased intestinal Ca absorption. Increased Ca absorption may be more dependent on oestrogen&amp;rsquo;s up-regulation of Ca transport genes than on vitamin D status.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) varies with latitude. Ebers has co-ordinated a study &lt;sup>[46]&lt;/sup> that examined more than 40,000 Canadian, British, Danish and Swedish patients with multiple sclerosis. The results show that in the Northern hemisphere, significantly fewer (8.5%) people with MS were born in November and significantly more (9.1%) were born in May. In the Southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed and November is the peak month and May the lowest. There are several clues as to the cause. An important study &lt;sup>[47]&lt;/sup> compared the risk of two or more siblings having multiple sclerosis to the risk of its occurrence in both twins in a non-identical pair. There should be no difference, but non-identical twins do have a significantly higher risk of both having MS than non-twin siblings. This suggests that the pre-natal and post-natal environment affects the overall risk. Pinpointing the actual environmental factor has been problematic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pregnancy outcomes not associated with low vitamin D – review</title><link>/posts/pregnancy-outcomes-not-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-review.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pregnancy-outcomes-not-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-review.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Aims Vitamin D deficiency in childhood is a common and recognised public health issue. National guidance recommends that all women should take 10 mcg vitamin D supplements daily during pregnancy and until their child is fully weaned, and midwives should offer this advice at the booking appointment. Two recent severe cases of vitamin D deficiency in infancy presented to our hospital, one with cardiac arrest secondary to hypocalcaemia and one with cardiomyopathy, illustrating the importance of such public health guidance. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, practice and barriers to implementation of vitamin D supplementation among midwives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>33 percent of pregnant women in Turkey had undetectable vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/33-percent-of-pregnant-women-in-turkey-had-undetectable-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/33-percent-of-pregnant-women-in-turkey-had-undetectable-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="bone-turnover-and-maternal-25oh-vitamin-d3-levels-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period-should-routine-vitamin-d-supplementation-be-increased-in-pregnant-women">Bone turnover and maternal 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels during pregnancy and the postpartum period: should routine vitamin D supplementation be increased in pregnant women?&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>We assessed if first-trimester vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in women who experienced a spontaneous preterm birth compared with women who delivered at term. We conducted a nested case-control study of pregnant women who had previously given blood for first-trimester combined screening for trisomy 21 and subsequently delivered at a tertiary hospital between November 2004 and July 2009. From an overall cohort of 4225 women, 40 cases of spontaneous preterm birth (? 23 (0)/ (7) and ? 34 (6)/ (7) weeks) were matched by race/ethnicity with 120 women delivering at term (? 37 (0)/ (7) weeks) with uncomplicated pregnancies.

&lt;p>The objective was to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women. Blood samples were taken from 154 African-American, 194 Hispanic, and 146 Caucasian women at &amp;lt;14 weeks of gestation; 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mean 25(OH)D levels in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women were 15.5 ± 7.2 (standard deviation), 24.1 ± 8.7, 29.0 ± 8.5 ng/mL, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of African-Americans, 81% of Hispanics, and 67% of Caucasians were deficient (25(OH)D levels &amp;lt;20 ng/mL or &amp;lt;50 nmol/L) or insufficient (25(OH)D levels ? 20 ng/mL or &amp;lt;32 ng/mL or ? 50 nmol/L or &amp;lt;80 nmol/L). Of these pregnant women, 82% had vitamin D levels &amp;lt;32 ng/mL (&amp;lt;80 ng/mL). In logistic regression models, race was the most important risk factor for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. African-American women and Hispanic women were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency than Caucasian women. Furthermore, primigravid women were more at risk for vitamin D insufficiency. This study demonstrates widespread vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in pregnant females living at a southern latitude. African-Americans are at greatest risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why higher levels of vitamin D reduces premature birth</title><link>/posts/why-higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-reduces-premature-birth.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/why-higher-levels-of-vitamin-d-reduces-premature-birth.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="adequate-vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-reduces-the-risk-of-premature-birth-by-reducing-placental-colonization-by-bacterial-vaginosis-species">Adequate Vitamin D during Pregnancy Reduces the Risk of Premature Birth by Reducing Placental Colonization by Bacterial Vaginosis Species&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone growth and maintenance. Among the bone-forming minerals, dietary calcium supply is close to biological requirements and may be limiting in some parts of the world where there are few rich dietary sources of calcium, particularly for children and women during pregnancy and lactation. Animal milk is a rich source of calcium and, in countries where milk is fortified with vitamin D, a contributor to dietary vitamin D intake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some males conceived in the fall in the North were shorter</title><link>/posts/some-males-conceived-in-the-fall-in-the-north-were-shorter.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/some-males-conceived-in-the-fall-in-the-north-were-shorter.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="season-of-birth-and-subsequent-body-size-the-potential-role-of-prenatal-vitamin-d">Season of birth and subsequent body size: The potential role of prenatal vitamin D.&lt;/h1>

Background: Maternal periodontal disease is found in ?40% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. 

Vitamin D deficiency may play a role in periodontal disease and tooth loss, and insufficient vitamin D status is common among pregnant women. 

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and periodontal disease. 

Methods: A case-control study was conducted. Cases were defined as pregnant women with clinical moderate to severe periodontal disease; controls were pregnant women who were periodontally healthy. Maternal data were chart abstracted and serum was collected between 14 and 26 weeks of gestation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[OH]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;D) levels were measured using liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Median serum 25(OH)D levels and prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (defined as &amp;lt;75 nmol/l) were compared between cases and controls. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for moderate to severe periodontal disease among women with vitamin D insufficiency was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for maternal race, season of blood draw, and other potential confounders. 

Results: A total of 117 cases were compared to 118 controls. 

Cases had lower median 25(OH)D levels than controls (59 versus 100 nmol/l; P &amp;lt;0.001) and were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency (65% versus 29%; P &amp;lt;0.001). 

The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for moderate to severe periodontal disease among women with vitamin D insufficiency was **2.1** (0.99 to 4.5). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[OH]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;D &amp;lt;75 nmol/l) is associated with maternal periodontal disease during pregnancy. Vitamin D
