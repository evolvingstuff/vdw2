Introduction: Helicobacter pylori is a globally prevalent infection, particularly in developing countries, with significant implications for gastrointestinal health in children. Recent studies suggest a potential link between vitamin D and its metabolites in

enhancing the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication therapies through their bactericidal properties.

Aim: To investigate the correlation between the vitamin D levels and their influence on clinical management and treatment

results of children patients, tested for H. pylori.

Material and methods: The study was conducted on a cohort of 128 paediatric patients. They were divided into 2 groups,

depending on whether positive (first group – A) or negative (second group – B ) for H. pylori. To determine vitamin D levels, venous

blood was taken from all participants from both groups. Group 1 included patients whose indexes were up to 10 ng/ml; Group 2

included patients whose indexes were from 10 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml; Group 3 levels were from 20 ng/ml to 30 ng/ml; and Group 4

indexes were over 30 ng/ml. The efficiency of the H. pylori eradication scheme in participants of these groups was evaluated.

Results: The mean values in Group A were higher than those in Group B: 17.1 and 14.9, respectively, p-value 0.03. Helicobacter pylori prevalence was higher in participants with vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml. As a result of the study, it was established that vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml in blood serum could be a predisposing factor in the spread of H. pylori in paediatric

patients. At the same time, different levels of deficiency below 30 ng/ml did not affect the frequency of H. pylori infection.

Conclusions: The obtained data can be used in developing guidelines for clinical management of children patients who are

primarily diagnosed with H. pylori and require eradication therapy.

#### Recent Advances in Vitamin D3 Intervention to Eradicate Helicobacter pylori Infection - Feb 2024

Helicobacter pylori (HP) infections affect approximately one-third of children worldwide. In China, the incidence of HP infection in children ranges from approximately 30% to 60%. In addition to damaging the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, HP infection in children can negatively affect their growth and development, hematology, respiratory and hepatobiliary system, skin, nutritional metabolism, and autoimmune system. However, the rate of HP eradication also fell considerably from the previous rate due to the presence of drug-resistant HP strains and the limited types of antibiotics that can be used in young patients. Vitamin D3 (VitD3) is a steroid hormone that can reduce inflammation in the stomach mucosa induced by HP and can alleviate and eradicate HP through a variety of pathways and mechanisms, including immune regulation and the stimulation of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) secretion and Ca2+ influx, to reestablish lysosomal acidification; thus, these results provide new strategies and ideas for the eradication of drug-resistant HP strains.

#### HP could be eradicated in those with 17 ng of Vitamin D (but not 12 ng) - Feb 2024

 **The effect of vitamin D levels on eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection** 

Hitit Medical Journal 2024, Volume: 6 Issue: 1, 28 - 32, 26.02.2024 https://doi.org/10.52827/hititmedj.1332272

Objective: Many factors are known to play a role in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (Hp). The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of 25(OH) vitamin D levels on the success of H. pylori eradication.

Material and Method: This retrospective study included 237 patients, aged 18-85 years, who presented at the Gastroenterology Polyclinic with dyspeptic complaints which had been ongoing for at least 6 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to their 25(OH) vitamin D level as >20ng/ml and <20ng/ml. For Hp eradication, the patients were administered treatment of 1x1 320 mg gemifloxacin, 2x1 1 gr amoxicillin, and 1 x1 40 mg rabeprazole. After 1 month of treatment, faecal examination was made to determine whether or not Hp was eradicated. The eradication rates were compared between the groups with high and low level 25(OH) vitamin D.

Results: The patients comprised 139 (58.6%) females and 98 (41.4%) males with a mean age of 40.9±14.1 years (range, 18-72 years). The 25(OH) vitamin D level was determined as mean 16.3±8.4 ng/mL (range, 3-42) in the whole sample, with an insufficient level seen in 211(89.0%) patients. In the comparison of 25(OH) vitamin D levels between the groups, the 25(OH) vitamin D level was determined to be 

* 16.8±8.5 in the group with Hp eradication and 

* 12.7±6.5 in the group without Hp eradication. 

The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p= 0.018).

Conclusion: Before H pylori eradication treatment, it is important to maintain optimal levels of 25(OH) vitamin D, which has an effect on the effectiveness of eradication.

#### Vitamin D and Its Association with H. pylori Prevalence and Eradication: A Comprehensive Review - Aug 2023

Nutrients 2023, 15(16), 3549; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15163549

Taking into account previous data that sustain a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and higher H. pylori infection positivity rates, this review aims to assess the influence of vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency upon the prevalence of H. pylori infection and its eradication success. Three major databases were searched for articles that analyzed a relationship between vitamin D status and H. pylori infection. The literature search retrieved a total of 37 reports, after the article selection process. 

Hypovitaminosis D emerged as a potential risk factor for H. pylori infection, given the higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency among H. pylori-positive subjects. Furthermore, the same type of micronutrient deficiency has been directly linked to H. pylori eradication failure. An inverse linear relationship between vitamin D status and gastric cancer risk exists, but the additional involvement of H. pylori in this correlation is still in question. The potential benefit of oral supplements in enhancing the success of classical therapeutic regimens of H. pylori still requires future research. Future population-based studies from larger geographical areas are warranted to address this subject in more depth.

BACKGROUND:

Various studies reported the relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) and vitamin D, but there is some controversy around that. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to clarify the relationship between vitamin D and H pylori infection, and vitamin D and H pylori eradication.

METHODS:

Articles published until June 1, 2019, in the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases with English-language medical studies were searched. According to the inclusion criteria, relevant statistical data were extracted to Microsoft Excel and analyzed by STATA15.1.

RESULTS:

Ten articles were finally included. It was demonstrated that average 25(OH)D level in H pylori-positive patients was lower than H pylori-negative (SMD = -0.53 ng/mL, 95% CI = (-0.91, -0.16 ng/mL)). For H pylori eradication individuals, the result showed that average 25(OH)D level in H pylori successful eradication individuals was higher than unsuccessful (SMD = 1.31 ng/mL, 95% CI = [0.60, 2.02 ng/mL](0.60,%202.02%20ng/mL)).

In addition, individuals with vitamin D deficiency had lower H pylori eradicate rate ( **OR = 0.09** , 95% CI = <span>[0.02, 0.41]</span>). Sensitivity analysis showed that the meta-analysis results were stable and reliable.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D was a protective factor to H pylori infection. Moreover, vitamin D can improve the success rate of H pylori eradication.

#### 2X worse response to Helicobacter Pylori Treatment if poor VDR - July 2023

 **Association Between Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphism and the Response to Helicobacter Pylori Treatment** 

Infect Drug Resist. 2023 Jul 8;16:4463-4469. [doi: 10.2147/IDR.S414186Yousry](https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S414186Yousry) Esam-Eldin Abo-Amer 1, Amal Ahmed Mohamed 2, Mohamed Mahmoud Elhoseeny 3, Samar M Rezk 4, Sherief Abdel-Salam 5, Abdulmohsen H Alrohaimi 6, Asmaa Sayed Abdelgeliel 7, Seham Saeed Alzahrani 8, Ibrahim Jafri 8, Leena S Alqahtani 9, Eman Fayad 8, Mohamed Fakhry 10, Moataz Yousry Soliman 11

Background & aims: This research aimed to determine how variations in the vitamin D receptor gene affected the response of H. pylori infections to eradication therapy.

Patients and methods: On 105 adult H. Pylori-positive patients, a prospective cohort study was carried out. PCR was used to genotype all patients' VDR gene polymorphisms. The patients in the study received standard triple eradication medication (clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, and omeprazole 20 mg) twice daily for 14 days. A stool test for H. pylori Ag was conducted 4 weeks following the end of treatment.

Results: In our study, the usual triple therapy's H. pylori eradication rate was 75.2%. The successful eradication of H. pylori and VDR rs 2228570 gene polymorphisms was more prevalent in CT gene polymorphism ( **64.6%** ) compared to non-responders ( **19.2%** ), while treatment failure was more prevalent in CC gene polymorphism (73.1% in non-responders compared to responders 24.1%), which is statistically significant. 

In regards to the eradication of H. pylori and VDR rs7975232 gene polymorphisms, the success of eradication was more prevalent in AC gene polymorphism (54.4%) vs non-responders (30.4%), while all patients (14) with gene AA (17.7%) are responders to standard treatment, while the failure of treatment was more prevalent in CC gene polymorphism (69.2% in non-responder vs 27.8% in responders) which is statistically significant. Our findings demonstrated a strong correlation between patients' responses to H. pylori treatment and polymorphisms in the VDR gene (ApaI and TaqI) (P 0.05).

Conclusion: As far as we are aware, this is the first study to identify a potential link between the FokI and Apal VDR polymorphism and treatment response in H pylori-positive patients. To evaluate the findings, more research with larger number of patients and different population is required.

#### Helicobacter pylori reduced in mice by vitamin D – Dec 2022

 **Vitamin D3 eradicates Helicobacter pylori by inducing VDR-CAMP signaling**  

Front Microbiol . 2022 Dec 8;13:1033201. [doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1033201.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1033201.) eCollection 2022.

Background: Vitamin D3 <span>[VitD3, 1,25 (OH)2D3]</span> is known to have immunomodulatory and anti-microbial properties; however, its activity against Helicobacter pylori is unclear. In this study, we established H. pylori infection models in wild-type and VitD3 receptor (VDR) knockdown mice and analyzed the effects of VitD3 and their underlying mechanisms.

Methods: VDR+/+ and VDR+/- mice were intragastrically infected with the H. pylori SS1 strain. After confirmation of H. pylori infection, mice were treated with different doses of VitD3. The infection levels in stomach tissues were quantified using the colony-forming assay, and the expression levels of the VDR and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) in the gastric mucosa were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.

Results: The gastric mucosa of VDR+/- mice was more susceptible to H. pylori colonization and had lower levels of VDR and CAMP expression than that of VDR+/+ mice. H. pylori infection upregulated VDR and CAMP expression in the stomach of both wild-type and mutant mice, and VitD3 treatment resulted in further increase of VDR and CAMP levels, while significantly and dose-dependently decreasing the H. pylori colonization rate in both mouse groups, without affecting blood calcium or phosphorus levels.

Conclusion: Our data indicate that oral administration of VitD3 reduces the H. pylori colonization rate and upregulates VDR and CAMP expression in the gastric mucosa, suggesting a role for VitD3/VDR/CAMP signaling in the eradication of H. pylori in the stomach. These findings provide important insights into the mechanism underlying the anti-H. pylori activity of VitD3 and should be useful in the development of measures to eradicate H. pylori.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is closely associated with the occurrence and development of gastric diseases. Therefore, eliminating H. pylori infection should help to prevent gastric diseases. Vitamin D3 (VitD3, 1,25(OH)2D3) was previously observed to exhibit anti-H. pylori infection activity in clinic, but these results were reported in heterogeneous in vivo studies without elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we established H. pylori infection models in both wild-type and VDR knockdown (VDR-KD) mice, which were used to demonstrate that VitD3 inhibits H. pylori infection by enhancing the expression of VitD receptor (VDR) and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP). Furthermore, VDR-KD mice that exhibited lower VDR expression were more susceptible to H. pylori infection. In cultured mouse primary gastric epithelial cells, we further demonstrated that the VitD3/VDR complex binds to the CAMP promoter region to increase its expression. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of the anti-H. pylori infection activity of VitD3 at the molecular level in mice and suggest a new avenue for the clinical management of H. pylori eradication therapy.

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/hp-vs-d.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

Background/Aim

Many studies have investigated risk factors other than antibiotic resistance linked to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication failure. The aim of this study was to study the effect of serum levels of 25‐hydroxy‐vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) on eradication rates of H. pylori infection.

Methods

This study included 150 patients diagnosed with H. pylori gastritis using magnifying narrow‐band imaging endoscopy supported by stool antigen test. Serum 25‐OH vitamin D levels were measured via the Enzyme‐Linked Immune Sorbent assay (ELISA) method before starting eradication therapy of H. pylori infection. All patients were treated with clarithromycin‐based triple therapy for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was determined via a stool antigen test performed 4 weeks after the end of therapy. According to the serum level of 25‐OH vitamin D levels, the patients were divided into two groups: group I (sufficient) had a vitamin D level of ≥20 ng/mL, while group II (deficient) had a vitamin D level of <20 ng/mL.

Results

Our results revealed that eradication was successful in 105 (70%) patients and failed in 45 (30%) patients. The mean 25<span>[OH]</span>D level was significantly lower in the eradication failure group compared to the successful treatment group (14.7 ± 4.5 vs 27.41 ± 7.1; P < 0.001). Furthermore, there were significantly more patients with deficient 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels in the failed treatment group, 30 (66.6%), compared to the successful group, 10 (9.5%) (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results demonstrated that 25‐OH vitamin D deficiency may be considered a risk factor related to eradication failure of H. pylori infection. In addition, a further randomized trial to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in H. pylori eradication is mandatory.

#### Mutiple Sclerosis Risk increased 2.1 X if pylori infection plus low vitamin D - May 2016

 **The Associations Between Helicobacter pylori Infection, Serum Vitamin D, and Metabolic Syndrome A Community-Based Study** 

Medicine 95(18):p e3616, May 2016. | DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000003616

Chen, Li-Wei MD; Chien, Chih-Yi PhD; Hsieh, Chia-Wen BA; Chang, Liang-Che MD; Huang, Mei-Huei MT; Huang, Wen-Yuan MT; Kuo, Sheng-Fong MD; Chien, Cheng-Hung MD; Lin, Chih-Lang PhD; Chien, Rong-Nan MD

The associations between Helicobacter pylori infection, serum vitamin D level, and metabolic syndrome (MS) are controversial. The present community-based study aimed to investigate the effect of H pylori infection and serum vitamin D deficiency on MS development.

Individuals from the northeastern region of Taiwan were enrolled in a community-based study from March, 2014 to August, 2015. All participants completed a demographic survey and underwent the urea breath test (UBT) to detect H pylori infection as well as blood tests to determine levels of vitamin D, adiponectin, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The ATP III criteria for MS were used in this study.

A total of 792 men and 1321 women were enrolled. The mean age was 56.4 ± 13.0 years. After adjusting for age and sex, the estimated odds of MS development for a UBT-positive subject were 1.503 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 1.206–1.872, P < 0.001) when compared to a UBT-negative subject. For participants with vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), the odds of MS development were 1.423 (95% CI: 1.029–1.967, P = 0.033) when compared to those with sufficient vitamin D level (>30 ng/mL). For participants with both H pylori infection and vitamin D deficiency, the odds of MS development were 2.140 (95% CI: 1.348–3.398, P = 0.001) when compared to subjects without H pylori infection and with sufficient vitamin D levels.

H pylori infection and vitamin D deficiency could be predictors of MS. For individuals with both H pylori infection and vitamin D deficiency, the odds of MS development were 2.140 when compared to individuals without H pylori infection and with sufficient vitamin D levels.

#### Helicobacter pylori Eradication: 88% if high vitamin D vs 38% if low - Feb 2021

 **Is Vitamin D Deficiency a Risk Factor for Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Failure?** 

Clin Lab . 2021 Feb 1;67(2). [doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200118.](https://doi.org/10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200118.)

Mokhtar M Shatla, Ahmed S Faisal, Mahmoud Z El-Readi

Background: Host factors related to failure of eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are increasingly studied. This work aimed to study the influence of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)-vitD]</span> status on the rate of H. pylori eradication.

Methods: One hundred and fifty patients infected with H. pylori were tested for serum 25(OH)-vitD level prior to 14 days clarithromycin-based triple eradication therapy. Accordingly, patients were divided into: group I (eradication successful) and group II (eradication failure). Both groups were compared regarding mean level of serum 25(OH)-vitD and number and percentage of patients with deficient 25 (OH)-vitD.

Results: Overall rate of eradication was 72%. Mean serum level of 25(OH)-vitD was higher in the eradication successful group compared to the group of eradication failure (28.12 ± 8.10 vs. 13.54 ± 6.37; p < 0.001). The percentage of patients with 25(OH)-vitD deficiency was higher in the group of eradication failure compared to the group of successful eradication <span>[30 (71.5%) vs. 19 (17.5%); p < 0.001]</span>. Patients with sufficient 25(OH)-vitD had a higher rate of eradication compared to patients with deficient 25(OH)-vitD (88% vs. 38.5%).

Conclusions: This study suggested that deficiency of 25(OH)-vitD could be a risk factor for H. pylori eradication failure, and it recommends to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on H. pylori eradication.
