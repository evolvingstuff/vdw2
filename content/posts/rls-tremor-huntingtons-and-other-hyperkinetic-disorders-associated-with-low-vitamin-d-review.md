Background: The importance of vitamin D deficiency in Parkinson's disease, its negative influence on bone health, and even disease pathogenesis has been studied intensively. However, despite its possible severe impact on health and quality of life, there is not a sufficient understanding of its role in other movement disorders. This systematic review aims at providing an overview of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, bone metabolism alterations, and fractures in each of the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders (HKMDs).

Methods: The study search was conducted through PubMed with keywords or Medical Related Subjects (MeSH) of common HKMDs linked with the terms of vitamin D, osteoporosis, injuries, and fractures.

Results: Out of 1585 studies screened 40 were included in our review. They show that there is evidence that several HKMDs, including Huntington disease, Restless Legs Syndrome, and tremor, are associated with low vitamin D serum levels in up to 83% and 89% of patients. Reduced bone mineral density associated with vitamin D insufficiency was described in Huntington disease.

Discussion: Our survey suggests that vitamin D deficiency, bone structure changes, and fractures are important but yet under-investigated issues in HKMDs. HKMDs-patients, particularly with a history of previous falls, should have their vitamin D-levels tested and supplemented where appropriate.

Highlights: Contrary to Parkinson's disease, vitamin D deficiency, and bone abnormalities are under-investigated in hyperkinetic movement disorders (HKMDs). Several HKMDs, including essential tremor, RLS, and Huntington disease, are associated with vitamin D deficiency in up to 89%, the latter also with reduced bone mineral density. Testing and where appropriate supplementation is recommended.
