Synthetic EPA (Vascepa) contains zero DHA

2 grams twice a day for 5 years had frequent side effects of joint pain

 **RESULTS  Clipped from PDF** 

“A total of 8179 patients were enrolled (70.7% for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events) and were followed for a median of 4.9 years. A primary end-point event occurred in 17.2% of the patients in the icosapent ethyl group, as compared with 22.0% of the patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.68 to 0.83; P<0.001);…”

#### Reduction of Cardiovascular events

* 1.25 X reduction of risk with $380/month Synthetic EPA

* [10 X reduction of risk when Omega-3 index is > 6](/posts/omega-3-is-vital-for-health-mail-in-test-is-low-cost-and-accurate)

* Thus a good level of Omega-3 provides **8 X**  the benefit of synthetic EPA 

#### Note

* No direct comparison of EPA+DHA (Omega-3) with Synthetic EPA

* The FDA only requires that a drug be safe and better than a placebo 

   * but not better than existing treatment or supplement

* FDA gets more than [45% of its annual budget from Industry fees( Big Pharma)](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance)

* Much more amount of money to be gained at many levels by prescribing a drug than by using a supplement

* [FDA now allows specific Omega-3 health claims – July 2019](/posts/fda-allows-2-specific-vitamin-d-and-2-omega-3-health-claims-2019)
