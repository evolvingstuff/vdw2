# Vitamin D and Calcium: Systematic Review  of Health Outcomes

 **Background:** Since the 1997 Dietary Reference Intake  (DRI) values for vitamin D and calcium were established new data have  become available on their relationship, both individually and combined,  to a wide range of health outcomes. The Institute of Medicine/Food and  Nutrition Board has constituted a DRI committee to undertake a review of  the evidence and potential revision of the current DRI values for these  nutrients. To support this review, several U.S. and Canadian Federal  Government agencies commissioned a systematic review of the scientific  literature for use during the deliberations by the committee. The intent  of providing a systematic review to the committee is to support  transparency of the literature review process and provide a foundation  for subsequent reviews of the nutrients.

Purpose:

To systematically summarize the evidence on the  relationship between vitamin D, calcium, and a combination of both  nutrients on a wide range of health outcomes as identified by the IOM,  AHRQ and technical expert panel convened to support the project.  

Data Sources: MEDLINEÂ®; Cochrane Central; Cochrane Database of  Systematic Reviews; and the Health Technology Assessments; search  limited to English-language articles in humans.

 **Study Selection:** Primary interventional or  observational studies that reported outcomes of interest in human  subjects in relation to vitamin D and/or calcium, as well as systematic  reviews that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cross sectional  and retrospective case-control studies were excluded.

 **Data Extraction:** A standardized protocol with  predefined criteria was used to extract details on study design,  interventions, outcomes, and study quality.

Data Synthesis: We summarized 165 primary articles and 11 systematic  reviews that incorporated over 200 additional primary articles.  Available evidence focused mainly on bone health, cardiovascular  diseases or cancer outcomes. For many outcomes, it was difficult to draw  firm conclusions on the basis of the available literature concerning  the association of either serum 25(OH)D concentration or calcium intake,  or the combination of both nutrients. Findings were inconsistent across  studies for colorectal and prostate cancer, and pregnancy-related  outcomes including preeclampsia. There were few studies for pancreatic  cancer and immune function. Among trials of hypertensive adults, calcium  supplementation lowered systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by  2-4 mm Hg. For body weight, the trials were consistent in finding no  significant effect of increased calcium intake on weight. For growth  rates, a meta-analysis did not find a significant effect on weight or  height gain attributable to calcium supplement in children. For bone  health, one systematic review found that vitamin D plus calcium  supplementation resulted in small increases in BMD of the spine and  other areas in postmenopausal women. For breast cancer, calcium intakes  in premenopausal women were associated with a decreased risk. For  prostate cancer, some studies reported that high calcium intakes were  associated with an increased risk.

 **Limitations:** Studies on vitamin D and calcium were  not specifically targeted at life stages (except for pregnant and  postmenopausal women) specified for the determination of DRI. There  is large variation on the methodological quality of studies examined.  Use of existing systematic reviews limits analyses that could be  performed on this source of information.

 **Conclusions:** The majority of the findings concerning  vitamin D, calcium, or a combination of both nutrients on the different  health outcomes were inconsistent. Synthesizing a dose-response  relation between intake of either vitamin D, calcium, or both nutrients  and health outcomes in this heterogeneous body of literature proved  challenging.
