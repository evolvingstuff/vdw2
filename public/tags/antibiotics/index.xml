&lt;p>“In a 2013 study, a dozen doctors from around the country examined all 363 articles published in The New England Journal of Medicine over a decade — 2001 through 2010 — that tested a current clinical practice, from the use of antibiotics to treat people with persistent Lyme disease symptoms (didn’t help) to the use of specialized sponges for preventing infections in patients having colorectal surgery (caused more infections). Their results, published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, found 146 studies that proved or strongly suggested that a current standard practice either had no benefit at all or was inferior to the practice it replaced; 138 articles supported the efficacy of an existing practice, and the remaining 79 were deemed inconclusive.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Understand, Refute, and Plan Studies Using Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/how-to-understand-refute-and-plan-studies-using-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/how-to-understand-refute-and-plan-studies-using-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The following is a copy from the website of International College of Human Nutrition and Functional Medicine&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="http://www.ichnfm.org/d">&lt;span style="color:#562FF5;">http://www.ichnfm.org/d&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="color:#562FF5;">Website includes many other studies and videos by &lt;/span>Alex Vasquez Posted 12 Feb updated 19 Feb 2017 by Alex Vasquez DC ND DO FACNThe ===&lt;a href="http://www.intjhumnutrfunctmed.org/journal/2017pdf/IJHNFM_2017_vitaminDresearch.pdf">PDF (download)&lt;/a>=== of this article is considered the final version. ===Defining the problems===: &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral infection in humans. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D influences virus replication. In this work, the effect of vitamin D treatment on dengue virus infection in human hepatic Huh-7 cells and on virus infection and cytokine production in the human monocytic U937 cells was evaluated. Exposure to 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, resulted in a &lt;strong>significant reduction in the number of infected cells&lt;/strong> , in conditions where cell viability was not affected. Viral replication in monocytic cells was more susceptible to vitamin D3 than replication in the hepatic cells. Moreover, vitamin D3 significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-1β) produced by infected U937 cells.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnesium deficiency reasons – 2013</title><link>/posts/magnesium-deficiency-reasons-2013.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/magnesium-deficiency-reasons-2013.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-definitive-guide-to-magnesium--mag-supplementshttpwwwmetabolicscomblogthe-definitive-guide-to-magnesium-and-magnesium-supplements-april-2013">&lt;a href="http://www.metabolics.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-magnesium-and-magnesium-supplements/">The Definitive Guide To Magnesium &amp;amp; Mag.

&lt;p>Pathogenic mechanisms underlying multiple sclerosis development have yet to be clearly identified, but considerable evidence indicates that autoimmunity plays an important role in the etiology of the disease. It is generally accepted that autoimmune diseases like MS arise from complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Although environmental factors unequivocally influencing MS development have yet to be established, accumulating evidence singles out several candidates, including sunlight-UV exposure or vitamin D deficiency, viral infections, hygiene, and cigarette smoking. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with different autoimmune diseases. Several investigations indicate 125 (OH)2 vitamin D plays a critical role in shaping T-cell response and inducing T cells with immunosuppressive properties. Likewise, helminth infections represent another potential environmental factor exerting immunomodulatory properties. Both epidemiological and experimental data provide evidence to support autoimmune down-regulation secondary to parasite infections in patients with MS, through regulatory T- and B-cell action, with effects extending beyond simple response to an infectious agent. Finally, different epidemiological studies have demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus infection confers added risk of developing MS. Proposed mechanisms responsible for this association include activation and expansion of self-reactive T and B cells, lower threshold for self-tolerance breakdown, and enhanced autoreactive B-cell survival, all to be discussed in this review. Understanding environmental factors influencing propensity to MS will lead to new and more effective approaches to prevent and treat the disease.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seasonal Affective Disorder - treated by both vitamin D and bright light</title><link>/posts/seasonal-affective-disorder-treated-by-both-vitamin-d-and-bright-light.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/seasonal-affective-disorder-treated-by-both-vitamin-d-and-bright-light.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Seasonal affective disorder or SAD is a recurrent major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern usually beginning in fall and continuing into winter months. A subsyndromal type of SAD, or S-SAD, is commonly known as “winter blues.” Less often, SAD causes depression in the spring or early summer. Symptoms center on sad mood and low energy. Those most at risk are female, are younger, live far from the equator, and have family histories of depression, bipolar disorder, or SAD. Screening instruments include the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). Typical treatment includes antidepressant medications, light therapy, Vitamin D, and counselling. This paper provides an overview of SAD.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pregnancy supplemented with 2,000 IU vitamin D got most infants to more than 12 nanograms</title><link>/posts/pregnancy-supplemented-with-2000-iu-vitamin-d-got-most-infants-to-more-than-12-nanograms.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pregnancy-supplemented-with-2000-iu-vitamin-d-got-most-infants-to-more-than-12-nanograms.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="maternal-vitamin-d-supplementation-at-50-μgd-protects-against-low-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-in-infants-at-8-wk-of-age-a-randomized-controlled-trial-of-3-doses-of-vitamin-d-beginning-in-gestation-and-continued-in-lactation">Maternal vitamin D₃ supplementation at 50 μg/d protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body. It has been recognized as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymatic reactions, where it is crucial for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) metabolism. Magnesium is required for DNA and RNA synthesis, reproduction, and protein synthesis. Moreover, magnesium is essential for the regulation of muscular contraction, blood pressure, insulin metabolism, cardiac excitability, vasomotor tone, nerve transmission and neuromuscular conduction. Imbalances in magnesium status—primarily hypomagnesemia as it is seen more common than hypermagnesemia—might result in unwanted neuromuscular, cardiac or nervous disorders. Based on magnesium&amp;rsquo;s many functions within the human body, it plays an important role in prevention and treatment of many diseases. Low levels of magnesium have been associated with a number of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke), migraine headaches, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off topic: Caesarean section increases risk of Eczema (Atopic dermatitis) by 1.8 X</title><link>/posts/off-topic-caesarean-section-increases-risk-of-eczema-atopic-dermatitis-by-18-x.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-caesarean-section-increases-risk-of-eczema-atopic-dermatitis-by-18-x.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="atopic-dermatitis-is-associated-with-caesarean-sections-in-korean-adolescents-but-asthma-is-not">Atopic dermatitis is associated with Caesarean sections in Korean adolescents but asthma is not.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Anaphylaxis is a dramatic expression of systemic allergy. The lifetime prevalence of anaphylaxis is currently estimated at 0.05-2 % in the USA and ~3 % in Europe. Several population-specific studies have noted a rise in the incidence, particularly in the hospitalizations and ER visits due to anaphylaxis. The variable signs and symptoms that constitute the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, the differences in diagnostic algorithms, and the limitations in the current coding systems have made summarizing epidemiologic data and comparing study results challenging. Nevertheless, across all studies, the most common triggers continue to be medications, food, and venom. Various risk factors for more severe reactions generally include older age, history of asthma, and having more comorbid diseases. Interesting seasonal, geographic, and latitude differences have been observed in anaphylaxis prevalence and incidence rates, suggesting a possible role of vitamin D and sun exposure in modifying anaphylaxis risk. While the incidence and prevalence of anaphylaxis appear to be increasing in certain populations, the overall fatality rate remains relatively low.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RSV (bronchitis and viral pneumonia) in infants associated with low vitamin D and antibiotics</title><link>/posts/rsv-bronchitis-and-viral-pneumonia-in-infants-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-and-antibiotics.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rsv-bronchitis-and-viral-pneumonia-in-infants-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-and-antibiotics.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="natural-history-and-epidemiology-of-respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-in-the-middle-east-hospital-surveillance-for-children-under-age-two-in-jordan">Natural history and epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus infection in the Middle East: Hospital surveillance for children under age two in Jordan&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is common among palliative cancer patients and has been connected to an increased risk for pain, depressions and infections. Therefore we wanted to test the hypothesis that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are associated with higher opioid dose, higher infectious burden and impaired quality of life in palliative cancer patients. The secondary aim was to investigate the association between 25OHD-levels and survival time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D and Inflammatory Bowel Disease – review</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-and-inflammatory-bowel-disease-review.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-and-inflammatory-bowel-disease-review.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Several studies on this page&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello. This is Dr JoAnn Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women&amp;rsquo;s Hospital. I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk with you about a very interesting and intriguing study that was recently published in Scientific Report&lt;sup>[1]&lt;/sup> by researchers at Georgetown Medical Center, suggesting that sunlight exposure may boost immune function through mechanisms that are completely separate from vitamin D. The study suggests that blue light specifically, within the visible light spectrum, may directly activate key immune cells and increase their motility. The researchers studied both human and mouse T lymphocytes after exposure to blue light. They found that the blue light triggered the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, which in turn activated key signaling pathways that led to increased movement and motility of the T cells.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D treats COPD thru many pathways</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-treats-copd-thru-many-pathways.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-treats-copd-thru-many-pathways.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="innate-immune-modulation-in-copd-moving-closer-towards-vitamin-d-therapy">Innate immune modulation in COPD: moving closer towards vitamin D therapy&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disturbed innate immune processes characterize the pathogenesis of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in COPD patients and has been associated with disease severity. Interestingly, a number of mechanistic evidence from animal and in vitro studies has demonstrated important innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and antimicrobial functions. In this review, we will discuss in detail how these innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D could provide therapeutic potential in COPD patients. Finally, the remaining challenges associated with vitamin D therapy in COPD patients will be discussed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D can probably stop 'modern' diseases - Gillie 2014</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-can-probably-stop-modern-diseases-gillie-2014.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-can-probably-stop-modern-diseases-gillie-2014.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The recent discovery that vitamin D regulates expression of the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide gene has generated renewed interest in using vitamin D to fight infectious diseases. This review describes the historical use of vitamin D or its sources to treat infections, the mechanism of action through which vitamin D mediates its “antibiotic” effects, findings from epidemiological studies associating vitamin D deficiency with increased susceptibility to infection and clinical trials with vitamin D supplementation to treat or prevent infections. Furthermore studies examining an association between vitamin D levels and cathelicidin expression are discussed. The role of cathelcidin throughout the course of infection from the initial encounter of the pathogen to the resolution of tissue damage and inflammation indicates that individuals need to maintain adequate levels of vitamin D for an optimal immune response. In addition, for treating infections, carefully designed randomized, clinical trials that are appropriately powered to detect modest effects, target populations that are severely deficient in vitamin D, and optimized dose, dosing frequency and safety are needed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1.8X increased risk of Obesity if antibiotics were used during pregnancy</title><link>/posts/18x-increased-risk-of-obesity-if-antibiotics-were-used-during-pregnancy.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/18x-increased-risk-of-obesity-if-antibiotics-were-used-during-pregnancy.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="see-also-web">See also web&lt;/h4>

Introduction
Inflammation is believed to be a contributing factor to many chronic diseases. The influence of vitamin D deficiency on inflammation is being explored but studies have not demonstrated a causative effect.
Methods
Low serum 25(OH)D is also found in healthy persons exposed to adequate sunlight. Despite increased vitamin D supplementation inflammatory diseases are increasing. The current method of determining vitamin D status may be at fault. The level of 25(OH)D does not always reflect the level of 1,25(OH)2D. Assessment of both metabolites often reveals elevated 1,25(OH)2D, indicating abnormal vitamin D endocrine function.
Findings
This article reviews vitamin D's influence on the immune system, examines the myths regarding vitamin D photosynthesis, discusses ways to accurately assess vitamin D status, describes the risks of supplementation, explains the effect of persistent infection on vitamin D metabolism and presents a novel immunotherapy which provides evidence of an infection connection to inflammation.
Conclusion
Some authorities now believe that low 25(OH)D is a consequence of chronic inflammation rather than the cause. Research points to a bacterial etiology pathogenesis for an inflammatory disease process which results in high 1,25(OH)2D and low 25(OH)D. Immunotherapy, directed at eradicating persistent intracellular pathogens, corrects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and resolves inflammatory symptoms.

!!!!Introduction
Inflammation is involved in many chronic diseases and concern has been raised about the influence of vitamin D deficiency on inflammatory processes. When studies found an association between inflammatory diseases and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), further research found evidence of low vitamin D in a large segment of the general population. This led some authorities to declare a world-wide epidemic of vitamin D deficiency and to recommend vitamin D supplementation. Experts are debating the definition of vitamin D deficiency and the appropriate vitamin D doses, while further research is being done to determine if vitamin D supplementation has the intended effect.
According to some current definitions of vitamin D deficiency, even healthy persons, exposed to adequate sunlight, are unable to acquire enough vitamin D without supplementation. Often reiterated causes of vitamin D deficiency can be disputed in the light of more current research. In the absence of definitive studies, authorities are questioning the wisdom of supplementing the general population with vitamin D. The definition of Vitamin D deficiency needs re-evaluation in view of the fact that low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy and sick individuals. Concerns about vitamin D deficiency merit a closer look at the current method of determining vitamin D status because the level of 25(OH)D does not always reflect the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25(OH)2D). Analysis of this active metabolite may reveal elevated 1,25(OH)2D) in the presence of low 25(OH)D and lead to a diagnosis of abnormal vitamin D endocrine system function.
An infectious pathogenesis posits that intracellular bacteria disrupt the vitamin D regulated immune system, resulting in persistent infection and chronic inflammation.
In the clinical setting, a novel immunotherapy is demonstrating the ability to resolve vitamin D metabolism dysfunction, restore immune function, and thus, eliminate infection and reduce inflammation. This review ponders the question, ‘‘Is low 25(OH)D a cause of, or a consequence of inflammation?” The answer is found in the evidence that adds persistent intracellular infection to the equation.
!!!!Vitamin D metabolism
The sequential metabolic processes that convert biologically inactive, parental vitamin D into active metabolites begin when vitamin D3 is photosynthesized in the skin or when vitamin D2 or D3 is ingested. Vitamin D is transported to the liver where it is hydroxylated by an enzyme (CYP2R1, also known as cytochrome P450 2R1) to produce 25(OH)D [1]. 25(OH)D is then transported to the kidneys where it is hydroxylated by another enzyme (CYP27B1, formerly 1a-hydroxylase) to produce 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D (also known as calcitriol), the active metabolite, is the most potent steroid hormone in the human body [2]. Feedback mechanisms regulate production of 1,25(OH)2D in the kidneys via serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast-like growth factor- 23 (FGF23) calcium, and phosphate [3]. 1,25(OH)2D is also produced in many other tissues (e.g., skin, macrophages, colon, pancreas, blood vessels, etc.) by enzymatic actions [4]. The vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) transports 1,25(OH)2D to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the cell nucleus [5]. The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factors. 1,25(OH)2D binds to the VDR and mediates the transcription of DNA, triggered by signaling proteins, like nuclear factor kappa-B (NFk-B) [6] (Fig. 1).
The influence of 1,25(OH)2D on the immune system is one of its most important roles. 1,25(OH)2D regulates the immune system via the VDR which is present in most immune cell types, particularly in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells [7]. 1,25(OH)2D activates the VDR to express antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as cathelicidin and beta defensins which attack pathogens [8, 9]. In general, the innate immune system is enhanced and the adaptive immune system is inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D [10, 11]. Thus, an effective immune response is heavily dependent on the vitamin D endocrine system which performs a balancing act of inflammation versus anti-inflammation.
!!!!Vitamin D deficiency
Concerns about vitamin D deficiency arose when studies showed patients with autoimmune diseases have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D and study subjects given vitamin D had lower rates of autoimmune diseases and fewer markers of inflammation [12, 13]. However, authorities have not agreed on the significance of low 25(OH)D and without a consistent normal range for serum 25(OH)D, the definitions of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency from the Vitamin D Council, the Endocrine Society and the Institute of Medicine vary significantly.
__The Vitamin D Council definition [14]:__
Deficient: 0-40 ng/ml
Sufficient: 40-80 ng/ml
High normal: 80-100 ng/ml
__The Endocrine Society definition [15]:__
Deficiency &lt; 20 ng/ml
Insufficiency = 20-29 ng/ml
__The Institute of Medicine definition [16]:__
Risk/deficiency &lt;12 ng/ml
Risk/insufficiency = 12-20 ng/ml
Sufficient = 20 ng/ml
In 2006, the Merck Manual listed 25-40 ng/ml as the normal 25(OH)D range [17]. Recently, this range has skyrocketed to 30-74 ng/ml [18]. Quest Diagnostics now lists the upper limit of normal 25(OH)D as 100 ng/ml [19]. Laboratory reference ranges for serum 25(OH)D levels have long been based upon average values from populations of healthy individuals but many people are now supplementing with vitamin D. In the US, the leading authority regarding medical research is the prestigious Institute of Medicine (IOM). The 2010 IOM report on vitamin D emphasized that the current measurements, or cut-off points, of sufficiency and deficiency of 25(OH) D in use by laboratories have not been set using rigorous scientific studies. It suggests that since no central authority has determined which cut-off points to use, reports of deficiency and lab ranges may be skewed and numbers overestimated [16]. Therefore, it would be prudent to use the IOM vitamin D deficiency guideline in the clinical setting, for clinical studies and when evaluating research results.
!!!!Purported reasons for vitamin D deficiency
Is low 25(OH)D among the general population an accurate assessment of vitamin D deficiency? Many reasons are cited for the current ‘epidemic’ of vitamin D ‘deficiency’ but closer examination reveals these beliefs are based on outdated or limited studies and can be challenged with more recent research.
Melanin pigmentation is only one factor that determines the amount of vitamin D3 which is photosynthesized [20, 21]. Bogh et al. [22] measured the baseline serum 25(OH)D and total cholesterol levels of 182 fair-skinned and dark-skinned subjects; and studied the effect of UV radiation on their serum 25(OH)D levels. They found the amount of serum 25(OH)D produced was determined by the amount of cholesterol in the skin, not on skin pigmentation. Matsuoka et al. [23] investigated the effect of racial pigmentation on vitamin D3 formation, simulating the process with a fixed dose of UVB radiation and concluded that while racial pigmentation has a photoprotective effect, it does not prevent the generation of normal levels of active vitamin D metabolites. Persons with dark skin also compensate for low 25(OH)D by rapidly converting it to the active 1,25(OH)2D metabolite, thus allowing them to maintain adequate vitamin D status [24]. Skin pigmentation does not appear to negatively affect vitamin D status [25].
Clothing is a barrier to vitamin D photosynthesis but this is an issue only for people who cover themselves from head to toe [26]. It takes relatively little sunlight exposure to acquire adequate stores of vitamin D and few people wear enough clothes to prevent that from happening. Ten to 15 min of sunlight or daylight exposure to a small area of skin (e.g., the forearm or face, etc.) twice a week, without sunscreen, supplies all the vitamin D necessary for health [27]. The belief that sunscreen lotion blocks vitamin D production is based on a 1987 study done by Matsuoka et al. [28] that was funded by the ultraviolet foundation, which is supported by the tanning bed industry. Contradictory information was provided by Diehl and Chiu [29] which concluded that although sunscreens are effective, many may not actually be blocking UV-B because they are improperly or inadequately applied [30]. Thus, sunscreen use may not actually diminish vitamin D synthesis in real world use. However, prolonged unprotected sun exposure should be avoided to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.
Although pollution can block some ultraviolet radiation, even in urban areas of high pollution 50 % of UV rays reach the ground [31]. A significant amount of UV radiation exposure can be obtained in dense metropolitan areas; tall buildings provide shade but shade gives up to 50 % of UV rays. Indoor workers receive 10-20 % of outdoor workers’ yearly UV exposure [31]; and for many, this may be adequate, especially if sunlight exposure is higher when they are not working. UV radiation is reflected or scattered to varying extents by different surfaces. The scattering and absorption of light by clouds may not significantly reduce natural light exposure because over 90 % of UV rays may penetrate clouds [31]. Environmental factors are rarely an impediment to photosynthesis of adequate vitamin D.
As the skin ages, there is a decline in the cutaneous levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol, resulting in a marked reduction of the skin’s capacity to produce vitamin D3 [32].
However, despite the up to fourfold reduction in vitamin D3 production in a 70-year-old compared to a 20-year-old, the skin has such a high capacity to make vitamin D3 that elders exposed to sunlight will produce an adequate amount of vitamin D3 to satisfy their vitamin D requirement [33, 34].
A 1988 study by Webb et al. [35] is often cited to support the conviction that latitude dramatically influences the amount of solar radiation available to synthesize vitamin D3. However, other researchers who conducted more recent studies refute this hypothesis. Kimlin et al. [36] report, ‘‘It may no longer be correct to assume that vitamin D levels in populations follow latitude gradients’’. And Lubin [37] states, ‘‘Geophysical surveys have shown that UV-B penetration over 24 h, during the summer months at Canadian north latitudes when there are many hours of sunlight, equals or exceeds UV-B penetration at the equator.’’ Ross et al. [16] report that ample opportunities exist to form vitamin D (and store it in the liver and fat for later use) from exposure to sunlight during the spring, summer, and fall months even in the far north latitudes.
Acceptance of these vitamin D myths regarding photosynthesis prevents consideration of the alternate hypothesis—low serum 25(OH)D, despite adequate photosynthesis of vitamin D3, is a result of an inflammatory process.
!!!!Low vitamin D is found in healthy subjects
Many studies of healthy subjects have found levels of 25(OH)D that, by some vitamin D definitions, are declared deficient (hypovitaminosis-D) [38, 39]. Vitamin D levels that are considered deficient have even been found in persons who are exposed to abundant sunlight [40]. Binkley et al. [41] showed a mean 25(OH)D level of 31.6 ng/ml among healthy young adult Hawaiian surfers. It is clear that low levels of 25(OH)D are found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. Opposing reasoning can be used to explain this contradiction. One explanation reasons that healthy persons with low 25(OH)D will become sick and sick people will develop lower 25(OH)D levels (Fig. 2); however, studies do not support this hypothesis. The correct explanation may be that, in the absence of disease, low 25(OH)D is normal.
!!!!Low vitamin D in the presence of diseases
Since low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, assessing vitamin D status with the measurement of an additional clinical marker may be helpful. It is asserted that D status with measurement of 1,25(OH)2D may be helpful low levels of 25(OH)D accurately reflect vitamin D status; however, measurement of 1,25(OH)2D often demonstrates a positive correlation of elevated 1,25(OH)2D to inflammatory diseases (Fig. 2). This is illustrated by Blaney et al.

Fig. 2 Interpretation of vitamin D deficiency via calcitriol measurement. Since low 25(OH)D is found in both healthy persons and those with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, assessing vitamin D status with measurement of 1,25(OH)2D may be helpful

in a study of 100 patients with autoimmune and chronic disease which found that 85 % of subjects had levels of 1,25(OH)2D higher than 46.2 pg/ml without hypercalcemia. Although this serum level may be considered normal by some, lab ranges for 1,25(OH)2D may have been skewed high by the presence of patients with unrecognized persistent intracellular infection and thus, dysregulated vitamin D metabolism. The Danish 1,25(OH)2D population data (from a large and reliable study) found the mean value for 1,25(OH)2D in a normal population was 29 pg/ml with a standard deviation of 9.5
. More frequent measurement of both D-metabolites in the clinical and research settings, may shed light on the true meaning of low 25(OH)D.
Rickets is often cited as proof of the need for vitamin D supplementation. However, a review of the metabolic processes involved provides some prospective. Adequate vitamin D is essential to prevent rickets, but adequate calcium is equally important; if either calcium or vitamin D is deficient, bone health suffers. Hypophosphatemia is the common denominator of all rickets; low calcium intake leads to hyperparathyroidism, which leads to high phosphorus excretion and, thus, phosphorus deficiency [44]. Rickets is rare in the developed world; however, children in developing countries, who usually photosynthesize enough vitamin D from sunlight, develop rickets if poverty prevents them from eating enough calcium-rich food [45, 46]. Studies have found that rickets occurs in sunny countries due to poor calcium intake and is cured with increased calcium ingestion [47, 48].
Osteoporosis is another disease which is closely linked with vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D is an important factor in maintaining bone health to avoid osteoporosis but a study by Reid et al. [49] published in The Lancet found little evidence supporting the use of vitamin D supplements by seniors hoping to improve bone density and ward off potential fractures. 1,25(OH)2D maintains calcium homeostasis between blood, cells and bones by stimulating calcium absorption from the intestines, reabsorption in the kidneys, and resorption in bones [50]. 1,25(OH)2D up- regulates the VDR in the small intestine, which then transcribes genes that shuttle calcium and phosphorus through the intestinal epithelium. However, mucosal response and calcium/phosphorus absorption are dependent on a competent VDR and elevated 1,25(OH)2D reduces VDR competence [51]. Thus, calcium and phosphorus absorption may be inhibited if VDR function is impaired by elevated 1,25(OH)2D. This is illustrated by Abreu et al. [52] in a study of Crohn’s patients with elevated 1,25(OH)2D and low bone mineral density which concluded that treatment of the underlying inflammation would improve metabolic bone disease. In fact, there is ample evidence that elevated 1,25(OH)2D leads to bone loss. Brot et al. [53] found that elevated levels of 1,25(OH)2D were strongly associated with decreased bone mineral density and content, and increased bone turnover. When levels are above 42 pg/ml 1,25(OH)2D stimulates bone osteoclasts. This leads to osteoporosis, dental fractures and calcium deposition into the soft tissues [54]. Vanderschueren et al. [55] found that a combination of high 1,25(OH)2D and low 25(OH)D is associated with the poorest bone health.
!!!!Vitamin D supplementation
It is reasoned that if low 25(OH)D indicates a current or potential disease state, then increasing 25(OH)D by supplementing with vitamin D should provide some symptom relief and/or protection. So far, there is scant evidence for this hypothesis [56, 57]. According to Ross et al. [16] in the 2010 IOM report, ‘‘Outcomes related to autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, falls and physical performance, immune functioning, infections, neuropsychological functioning, and preeclampsia could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake and were often conflicting.’’ Despite the recent increase in vitamin D supplementation, chronic diseases have increased and are expected to continue increasing [58, 59].
Consequently, more vitamin D experts are beginning to reconsider vitamin D supplementation among the general population [60]. Recommending higher vitamin D intake to large populations carries the potential risk of overdosing certain individuals [61]. It is difficult to ingest too much vitamin D from food, and natural mechanisms regulate the amount of vitamin D3 photosynthesized from sunlight [62].
However, elevated 25(OH)D and hypervitaminosis-D can occur due to vitamin D supplementation [63]. A study by Noordam et al. [65] cast doubt on the causal nature of previously reported associations between low levels of vitamin D and age-related diseases and mortality. A comprehensive review by Autier et al. [65] concluded that low concentrations of 25(OH)D are most likely an effect of health disorders and not a cause of illness. Commenting on the findings in a press statement, Autier et al. [64] advised against vitamin D supplementation and explained the observed discrepancy between observational and randomized trials:
Decreases in vitamin D levels are a marker of deteriorating health. Ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course reduce vitamin D concentrations, which would explain why vitamin D deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders. We postulate that inflammation is the common factor between most nonskeletal health disorders and low 25(OH)D concentrations. Inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence and clinical course would reduce 25(OH)D, which would explain why low vitamin D status is reported in a wide range of disorders. However, increases in 25(OH)D have no effect on inflammatory processes or on disorders at the origin of these processes.
A 2014 meta-analysis by Bolland et al. [66] on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on skeletal, vascular, or cancer outcomes concludes that vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium does not reduce skeletal or non-skeletal outcomes in unselected community-dwelling individuals by more than 15 %. The authors further state that future trials with similar designs are unlikely to alter these conclusions. Because of emerging concerns about elevated 25(OH)D, the IOM has shifted the paradigm from thinking about ‘more is better’ to a more risk-averse approach [67]. It has also challenged the notion that harm should be viewed in terms of vitamin D toxicity such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or metastatic calcification and has advanced the concept of ‘harm’ in terms of chronic disease outcomes and mortality [16]. Because adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation may take decades to be realized, clinicians (mindful of the medical ethics precept ‘‘First, do no harm’’) should err on the side of caution; follow the IOM guideline and wait for the results of longterm vitamin D studies.
!!!!Bacterial pathogenesis of low vitamin D hypothesis
If evidence indicates that most people get adequate vitamin D from sunlight exposure but healthy persons are found to be ‘deficient’ by recent standards, what is the explanation for this phenomenon? Vitamin D proponents use a disease deficiency model to explain low levels of 25(OH)D. Their hypothesis states low 25(OH)D causes chronic diseases; however, a pathogenesis has not been elucidated [68]. Low serum 25(OH)D in the presence of disease can also be explained with a dysregulated vitamin D metabolism model [69]. This hypothesis proposes that low vitamin D is the consequence of a chronic inflammatory process caused by persistent infection. The bacterial pathogenesis theorizes that intracellular (cell wall deficient) bacteria invade nucleated cells, use strategies to avoid destruction and cause abnormal vitamin D endocrine function, resulting in low vitamin D. Excess 1,25(OH)2D is produced in an effort to up-regulate the VDR to transcribe AMPs; and 25(OH)D is rapidly metabolized in the process, resulting in a low serum level. The resulting elevated 1,25(OH)2D causes chronic, systemic inflammation and its accompanying symptoms (Fig. 3).
The existence of bacteria which are capable of invading human cells has been known for over a century and are described by many authors [70, 71]. The lack of a cell wall enables them to enter human cells and proliferate because they fail to elicit an appropriate response when the immune system is compromised. In particular, they enter the macrophages—the very immune cells deployed to kill invading pathogens. The inability of most research labs to culture cell wall deficient (CWD) bacteria has been an obstacle to their acceptance, and reliance on Koch’s postulates has made it difficult to correlate CWD bacteria to specific diseases [72]. But some researchers believe Koch’s postulates may have to be redefined in terms of molecular data when dormant and non-culturable bacteria are implicated as causative agents of mysterious diseases [73]. OConnor et al. [74] (in their article entitled Emerging Infectious Determinants of Chronic Diseases) report, ‘‘microbes can now be irrefutably linked to pathology without meeting Koch’s postulates” and “...powerful tools of molecular biology have exposed new causal links by detecting diffi- cult-to-culture and novel agents in chronic illness settings.’’ Domingue [75] commented, ‘‘This might translate into an etiology for chronic inflammatory diseases, when the stressed bacteria increase in numbers and overwhelm the normal biological functions of the host.’’ Nunez [76] was quoted in the University of Michigan Health System newsletter, ‘‘In our study, the presence of bacterial microbes inside the cell is what triggers the immune response.’’ Rolhion and Darfeuille-Michaud [77] observed that the presence of pathogenic invasive bacteria could be the link between an innate immune response to invasive bacteria and the development of inflammation. A number of studies suggest disease associations with CWD bacteria [78-83]. Verway et al. [79] report ‘‘.data suggest that at least a subset of the genetic predisposition to Crohn’s disease results from defects in the detection and/or processing of intracellular pathogens by the innate immune system.’’ O’Connor et al. [74] state, ‘‘The epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features of many chronic inflammatory diseases are consistent with a microbial cause. Infectious agents likely determine more cancers, immune-mediated syndromes, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other chronic conditions than currently appreciated.”
CWD bacteria are considered communicable but not contagious; protective immunity depends on an effective cell-mediated immune response [80]. It is now well appreciated that pathologic processes caused by infectious agents may only emerge clinically after an incubation of decades [81]. Among the speculated causes of the increase in chronic infections are overuse of beta-lactam antibiotics [82, 83] and immunosuppression via excess 25(OH)D production [84] or immunosuppressive medications [85]. Many microbiologists now believe at least some, if not all, of the inflammation which drives the chronic disease process is caused by the presence of these stealthy intracellular pathogens [86]. A considerable body of experimental and clinical evidence supports the concept that difficult-to- culture and dormant bacteria are involved in latency of infection and that these persistent bacteria may be pathogenic [73, 87, 88]. McDougal [89] states, ‘‘Evidence now confirms that non-communicable chronic diseases can stem from infectious agents.’’
!!!!Effects of intracellular pathogens on the immune system
Pathogens gain many advantages by parasitizing immune cells and altering nuclear receptor activity. Tissue invasion provides a privileged niche with access to host protein and iron, sequestration from immune response, and a means for persistence [90]. In the arms race of host-microbe coevolution, successful microbial pathogens have evolved innovative strategies to evade host immune responses. For example, ‘crosstalk manipulation’ undermines host defenses and contributes to microbial adaptive fitness [91, 92]. Pathogenic microbes also induce stress responses which protect the cell from lethal factors, express proteases that degrade AMPs, use biofilms as a shield and modulate host cell motility to facilitate establishment of an infection [93, 94]. Genetic foreign and host protein interactions alter gene transcription and translation mechanisms, and many species survive by horizontal gene transfer [95, 96].
It is theorized that bacteria have developed some of these strategies in order to invade host cells and remain undetected within cellular cytoplasm. Many bacterial pathogens form antibiotic-tolerant persister cells which can replicate within macrophages. In this form they can cause subclinical infection and have been associated with chronic diseases [95, 97, 98]. Intracellular bacteria can modulate cytokine production [99]; and in monocytes and macrophages, cytokine activation markedly inhibits 1,25(OH)2D/ VDR gene transcription [100].
Macrophage microbicidal mechanisms are responsible for the control and elimination of pathogens. 1,25(OH)2D production and action in macrophages activates toll-like receptors to increase expression of the AMP cathelicidin which kills infectious invaders [101, 102]. When the immune system is fighting a persistent microbe, inflammatory molecules are continuously released in an effort to kill the pathogen [103]. Immune defenses stimulate Th17 cells and contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory conditions [104,	105]. An ineffective immunological response causes low-grade inflammation and hagocyte-inflicted tissue damage plays an important role in many chronic diseases [106]; autoimmune patients acquire a distinct pathogenic microbiota and multi-morbidity often results [107, 108]. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that bacteria have evolved strategies which allow them to persist within host cells. The exact mechanisms are unknown and warrant further study.
!!!!The compromised immune system, infection and vitamin D
In an essay on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and immune response, Smith [109] postulated that unresolved cellular stress may be caused by infectious agents to avoid adaptive immune responses. The host immune response has developed many mechanisms to neutralize and remove pathogenic bacteria. In turn, pathogenic bacteria have developed mechanisms to alter and evade the host immune response [110, 111]. Regulation of the VDR is a common mechanism used in the host defense against pathogens but certain microbes have been shown to slow innate immune defenses by down-regulating the VDR:
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis down-regulates VDR activity [112].
*Mycobacterium leprae inhibits VDR activity through down-regulation of CYP27B1 in monocytes [113].
*Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a toxin capable of down-regulating the VDR in macrophages [114].
*Epstein-Barr virus lowers VDR activity [115].
*HIV completely shuts down VDR activity [116].
*In VDR knockout mice, a circumstance that closely mimics extreme VDR dysregulation, 1,25(OH)2D levels increase by a factor of ten [117].
Studies also point to immune system depression and elevated 1,25(OH)2D in chronic diseases [118]:
*Sarcoidosis patients are deficient in cathelicidin despite healthy vitamin D3 levels [119].
*1,25(OH)2D is high (>60 pg/ml) in 42 % of Crohn’s patients and the source of the active vitamin D may be the inflamed intestine [52].
*1,25(OH)2D is elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with RA (rheumatoid arthritis) [120].
*Crohn’s disease decreases expression of cathelicidin [121].
High levels of 1,25(OH)2D may result when down- regulation of the VDR by bacterial ligands prevents the receptor from expressing enzymes necessary to keep 1,25(OH)2D in a normal range [42]. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D further reduces VDR competence, suppresses macrophage function, and blocks the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway; thus inhibiting immune system function [116, 122, 123]. Reducing the ability of the VDR to express elements of innate immune function allows intracellular bacteria to persist in the cytoplasm of nucleated cells and may account for the increased susceptibility to non-bacterial co-infections that are commonly found in patients with chronic illnesses [124, 125]. Theoretically, immune system suppression allows parasitic microbes to persist and proliferate in host phagocytes, successfully compete for nutritional resources, and displace commensal organisms from their niche [126]. Elevated 1,25(OH)2D appears to be evidence of a disabled immune system’s attempt to activate the VDR to combat infection.
!!!!Autoimmune disease
Numerous examples can be found in which pathogens express antigens that cross-react with host antigens or induce local inflammatory responses that can lead to autoimmune responses through a very complex set of circumstances [127]. The prevailing theory regarding the etiology of autoimmune disease states that an overactive immune system produces auto-antibodies against self, but infection as an environmental factor in autoimmunity has long been recognized. An alternate hypothesis posits a bacterial etiology in which a persistent intracellular infection causes a cytokine release that induces signals to T cells and B cells, and the antibodies they produce (to the intracellular invader) include some that attack human proteins, as well as target the pathogens [128, 129]. Christen et al. [130] explored this hypothesis, ‘‘In theory, a structural similarity or identity between the host and an invading pathogen might cause the immune system of the host to react not only to the pathogen but also to self-components.’’ Infections can act as environmental triggers inducing or promoting autoimmune disease in genetically predisposed individuals [131]; researchers have shown how antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are created in response to infectious agents [132, 133].
Vitamin D appears to have a positive effect on autoimmune disease due to immune system suppression [122, 134, 135] and immune suppression is considered therapeutically beneficial for autoimmune diseases [136, 137]. However, vitamin D proponents have failed to recognize that positive effects are due to the immunosuppressive effect of elevated 25(OH)D or to understand that immunosuppression is contraindicated because of the probable presence of intracellular infection. When the immune system is suppressed clinical disease markers and symptoms are reduced but immunosuppression does not address an underlying cause of persistent bacteria, thus relapse is common [138]. Verway et al. [79] wonder, ‘‘Is a specific pathogen responsible for disease or rather is a dysregulated immune response generated against a complex microbial population? Why would immune-suppressive drugs be efficacious if the primary defect is an immune deficiency?” Much of current research focuses on finding drugs to suppress inflammation but, according to Collins [139], 95 % of these studies have failed It seems clear a better direction is needed. Immunotherapy which restores VDR competence corrects dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and eliminates intracellular bacteria could be the answer (as discussed in the section titled Restoring VDR Competence).
!!!!Dysregulated vitamin D metabolism
In a healthy individual, the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immunity cooperates to mount an appropriate response to infection through regulation of the vitamin D endocrine system [140]. The immune system detects and responds to the presence of intracellular bacteria by producing more 1,25(OH)2D to activate the VDR and express the crucial endogenous AMPs which enable the innate immune system to target intracellular pathogens [141]. Renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is tightly selfregulated, with the end product down-regulating its own further production. In contrast, extra-renal tissues (e.g., uterine decidua and placenta, colon, breast, prostate, spleen, bone, keratinocytes, melanoma and synovial cells, pulmonary monocytes and macrophages, etc.) which produce 1,25(OH)2D are regulated by cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma), lipopolysaccharide, nitric oxide and intracellular VDBP, which activate the enzyme CYP27B1 to stimulate conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D [142]. This extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D in tissues infected with intracellular bacteria can result in an excess in production of 1,25(OH)2D which may contribute to depletion and low levels of 25(OH)D [143] (Fig. 4).
Because extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is primarily dependent on the availability of 25(OH)D [144], supplementation with vitamin D to increase 25(OH)D may promote the production of 1,25(OH)2D in non-renal tissues that are sites of intracellular infection and result in hypervitaminosis-D

{img attId="4412"}
Fig. 4 Proposed hypothesis for excess 1,25(OH)2D production in bacterially-stimulated extrarenal tissues. Extra-renal tissues, which produce 1,25(OH)2D, are regulated by cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, nitric oxide and intracellular VDBP, which activate the enzyme CYP27B1 to stimulate conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, resulting in low 25(OH)D

{img attId="4413"}
Fig. 5 Proposed hypothesis for dysregulated vitamin D metabolism caused by intracellular pathogens. Theoretically, when nucleated cells are parasitized by intracellular bacteria, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D increases, the kidneys lose control of 1,25(OH)2D production, and pro-hormone 25(OH)D decreases due to rapid conversion to 1,25(OH)2D

Sunlight appears to play a part in this process and many patients with autoimmune disease report sun sensitivity. The skin (dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes possess VDR) has the capacity to synthesize 1,25(OH)2D, and represents an important target tissue for 1,25(OH)2D [145]. If keratinocytes in the skin are infected, natural regulation of photosynthesis may be thwarted and solar energy may overstimulate cellular activity, resulting in an increase in cutaneous production of vitamin D3, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D following sun exposure.
We hypothesize that when nucleated cells are parasitized by intracellular bacteria, extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D increases, the kidneys lose control of 1,25(OH)2D production, and pro-hormone 25(OH)D decreases due to rapid conversion to 1,25(OH)2D. 
The following mechanisms are thought to be responsible (Fig. 5):
*Inflammatory cytokines activate CYP27B1, an enzyme that causes more 25(OH)D to be converted to 1,25(OH)2D [146].
*The microbial-repressed VDR cannot transcribe CYP24A1 (formerly 24-hydroxylase), an enzyme that breaks down excess 1,25(OH)2D [147].
*Excess 1,25(OH)2D binds the PXR (pregnane X receptor), to inhibit conversion of vitamin D3 to 25(OH)D so 25(OH)D is down-regulated [148].
*1,25(OH)2D inhibits the hepatic synthesis of 25(OH)D [149].
Thus, low 25(OH)D may be a consequence of the inflammatory process. More studies are concluding that suboptimal circulating levels of vitamin D appear to be caused by the disease process. Waldronn et al. [150] found serum 25(OH)D was decreased following an acute inflammatory insult (i.e., orthopedic surgery) and concluded that hypovitaminosis-D may be the consequence rather than cause of chronic inflammatory diseases. Ferder et al. [151] state, there may be a relationship between inflammatory processes induced by chronic overstimulation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the worldwide vitamin D deficiency. In fact, the pandemic of vitamin D deficiency could be the other face of increased RAS activity, which could potentially cause a lower activity or lower levels of Vitamin D.’’
!!!!Diagnosis of dysregulated vitamin D metabolism
Assessing dysregulated vitamin D metabolism has the potential to guide clinical practice [152, 153]. Vitamin D status is currently determined by measuring the level of serum 25(OH)D which, presumably, reflects the serum levels of other vitamin D metabolites (e.g., vitamin D3, vitamin D2 and 1,25(OH)2D, etc.). This measurement may not, however, provide enough information to assess vitamin D endocrine function. The clinical utility of measuring 1,25(OH)D is not fully understood, but it is clear that associations are being made between this active metabolite of vitamin D and disease states [154]. 1,25(OH)2D is not being used as a measure associated with vitamin D nutritional status or as an intermediate marker related to health outcomes, or even routinely assessed in vitamin D research. In the context of solving the puzzle of low 25(OH)D, the reasons cited for this lapse fail to consider the possibility of abnormal levels in the presence of chronic inflammation:
*1,25(OH)2D has a short half-life (hours) and fluctuates rapidly.
+However, a high result may be discovered even at trough level.
*1,25(OH)2D levels are regulated by PTH, calcium, phosphate.
+This is not true if extra-renal production is prevalent [143].
*1,25(OH)2D does not decrease until 25(OH)D is very low.
+A low 25(OH)D may be a sign that 1,25(OH)2D is abnormally high [55].
*1,25(OH)2D is only over-produced in hypercalcemic disease states such as sarcoidosis.
+Studies show this is not true [42].
*1,25(OH)2D may be elevated as a result of up- regulation of the CYP27B1 enzyme.
+This begs the question, Why is this enzyme elevated [146]?
Measuring both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D (and PTH, calcium, phosphate when indicated) as clinical markers in
Table 1 D-metabolites tests
Serum 25(OH)D [157]
CPT code: 82306 [157]
Lowest mortality reported at 20 ng/ml [158] Immunosuppression reported when higher than 30 ng/ml [122] Serum 1,25(OH)2D [157]
CPT code: 82652 [157]
ICD-9 code:
275.40 Disorder of calcium metabolism, unspecified [157] Maximum normal = 45 pg/ml [17]
chronic disease is more likely to provide a true picture of vitamin D status, than measuring 25(OH)D alone [155, 156] (Table 1). Measuring 1,25(OH)2D should be considered in patients with low 25(OH)D, abnormal laboratory results (especially inflammatory markers), a diagnosis of autoimmune disease or other chronic inflammatory illness, or signs of chronic systemic inflammation. For example, elevated 1,25(OH)2D may serve as a marker of Crohn’s disease [52]. The 1,25(OH)2D test is a delicate assay which is only done in specialized laboratories. False low results have been observed due to apparent sample mishandling; freezing for transport is advised to prevent sample degradation due to agitation. A high result is always accurate.
!!!!Restoration of VDR competence
The ability to mount an appropriate immune system response to intracellular infection is highly dependent on a competent VDR [159]. When it appears that 1,25(OH)2D is unable to up-regulate the VDR due to microbial activity, VDR competence may be restored with another VDR ligand which acts as an agonist; an agonist increases the signal transduction activity of a cell when bound to a receptor on that cell. Over 3000 synthetic VDR ligands have been identified, but most of these 1,25(OH)2D analogues have no clinical use because of their undue disruption to calcium regulation [160]. A number of nonvitamin D VDR ligands have also been identified: curcu- min, omega-6 fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid, linoleic acid), and lithocolic acid (LCA) but are not being used for this purpose [161, 162].
Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown, via in silico molecular modeling, to modulate VDR activation [163]. The most promising ARB, __olmesartan__ medoxomil (brand name Benicar®) was estimated to have a Ki value in the low nanomolar range, similar to the Ki values of the natural VDR ligands [163].

Fig. 6 Proposed hypothesis for restoring renal control of 1,25(OH)2D with __olmesartan__. __olmesartan__ is believed to decrease elevated 1,25(OH)2D by several mechanisms

__Olmesartan__ has been noted to cause a significant reduction in elevated 1,25(OH)2D within weeks of initiation, which provides
further evidence of its ability to up-regulate the VDR [164]. __olmesartan__ is believed to decrease elevated 1,25(OH)2D by several VDR-mediated effects (Fig. 6). The up-regulated VDR:
*transcribes CYP24A1 and CYP3A4 (enzymes which reduce 1,25(OH)2D production) [147].
*represses CYP27B1 (the enzyme that hydroxylates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D) so less 1,25(OH)2D is produced [146].
Consequently, renal control of 1,25(OH)2D production is restored and extra-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D is reduced. A decrease in elevated 1,25(OH)2D means less systemic inflammation, as these studies of __olmesartan__ indicate:
*Improvement of glycemic control and insulin resistance was only observed in the __olmesartan__ group and these effects of __olmesartan__ might be mediated by an antiinflammatory action [165].
*__Olmesartan__ treatment significantly reduced serum levels of inflammatory markers; h-CRP, h-TNFa, IL-6, MCP-1 after 6 weeks of therapy [166].
*Blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme induces potent regulatory T cells and modulates TH1- and TH17-mediated autoimmunity [167].
*Blocking angiotensin II receptor increases bone mass [168, 169].
__Olmesartan__ acts in a manner similar to 1,25(OH)2D to reduce inflammation and, by inference, improve immune system function. VDR and RAS receptors are distributed in almost the same tissues. The endogenous VDR ligand 1,25(OH)2D down-regulates the RAS by repressing renin gene expression to reduce inflammation via the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway [170]. __olmesartan__ has a similar effect in that it reduces angiotensin II (a peptide that is implicated in the inflammatory process) [171]. Inappropriate stimulation of the RAS has been associated with the pathogenesis of hypertension, heart attack and stroke [151]. Ferder et al. [151] state, ‘‘Changes in RAS activity and activation of the VDR seem to be inversely related, making it possible to speculate that both systems could have a feedback relationship. The combination of RAS blockade and VDR stimulation appears to be more effective than each one used individually.” Blocking angiotensin II and stimulating the VDR is what __olmesartan__ appears to accomplish and this function is consistent with a theory of VDR incompetence (Fig. 7).
In patients with autoimmune disorders and inflammatory symptoms, __olmesartan__ is noted to provoke an increase in inflammatory symptoms indicative of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (JHR). JHR is a cascade of reactions including inflammation, cytokine release, and endotoxin release as part of the immune response to the disintegration of infected cells [172]. This immunopathology suggests transcription of AMPs by an activated VDR, points to the presence of occult infection and provides additional evidence that __olmesartan__ is a VDR agonist [167, 173, 174]. Theoretically, __olmesartan__ restores VDR competence and, thus, phagocytosis leads to bacterial death; consequently, inflammation is temporarily increased by cytokine reaction to microbial endotoxins and cellular debris from dead host cells and bacteria [175].
Hajishengallis and Lambris [92] conclude that a blockade of hijacked receptors of the innate immune system may offer promising options to control infection and associated immunopathology. Although this use of __olmesartan__ is off- label, its safety profile is well established [176]. The multiple, documented beneficial effects of __olmesartan__, including the ability to reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease, prevent migraines, and reduce oxidative stress, also suggest it could play a key role in the resolution of chronic systemic inflammation [177, 178].
!!!!Clinical use of __olmesartan__
__Olmesartan__ is being used as a novel VDR ligand in the clinical setting [179]. Immunotherapy with __olmesartan__ may also include pulsed administration of select MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) oral antibiotics to weaken and help eradicate the intracellular pathogens. With each antibiotic dose, inflammatory symptoms (JHR) wax and wane, providing further evidence of persistent infection [180]. Changes in laboratory findings (e.g., BUN, creatinine, CRP, blood counts, liver enzymes) often point to areas of occult inflammation. A correlating treatment strategy is the avoidance of excessive sunlight exposure, foods high in vitamin D and vitamin D supplements to maintain serum 25(OH)D at a level (20-30 ng/ml) that is not likely to suppress the immune system and inhibit bacterial elimination [122, 135, 137].
Accumulating case reports now support the observation that a number of complex, chronic conditions can be improved by restoring VDR function using this type of immunotherapy [179, 181, 182]. It is becoming increasingly clear that microbes slow down immune reactivity by dysregulating the VDR, ultimately to increase their chance of survival. Immune modulatory therapies that enhance VDR expression and activity should, therefore, be considered in the clinical setting [183].
!!!!Discussion
Vitamin D is essential for many important biological processes and most people get an adequate supply from exposure to sunlight (Table 2). Long-term studies are needed to determine if low 25(OH)D in healthy individuals leads to disease. Evidence that vitamin D supplementation cures or prevents chronic disease is inconsistent. Despite increased supplementation chronic inflammatory diseases are on the rise. Attention to the alternate hypothesis—low 25(OH)D is a consequence of the chronic disease process, provoked by persistent intracellular infection—may be crucial to reversing this trend and needs further research.

!!!!Table 2 Key points
*Vitamin D is a steroid hormone which regulates immune system function
*Photosynthesis of vitamin D3 provides adequate vitamin D stores for most individuals
*Low levels of 25(OH)D are seen in healthy individuals, as well as those with chronic inflammatory conditions
*Studies are inconsistent regarding the health benefits of increasing vitamin D stores; vitamin D supplementation may have negative effects
*25(OH)D may not always reflect the level of 1,25(OH)D; accurate assessment of vitamin D status depends on measuring both metabolites
*Intracellular, cell wall deficient bacteria may cause dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and impaired immune system function
*A novel, non-vitamin D VDR ligand (an angiotensin receptor blocker) appears to 
+reactivate the immune system, 
+restore VDR competence, 
+correct dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and 
+reduce inflammatory symptoms
The prevailing dogma that the level of serum 25(OH)D provides an accurate assessment of vitamin D status needs closer examination. Circulating levels of 25(OH)D may not be an accurate reflection of vitamin D status. In those with an autoimmune disease or chronic inflammatory symptoms, 1,25(OH)2D may be elevated. This can lead to osteoporosis and cause inhibition of innate immunity, which is contraindicated in the presence of infection. The resulting immunosuppression may promote persistentinfection which has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases.
Human cells live in harmony with many types of microbes but some microbes may become pathogenic under commonly experienced conditions. The innate immune system is designed to kill pathogens via 1,25(OH)2D- mediated VDR transcription of anti-microbial peptides but microbes may use strategies which down-regulate the VDR in order to live and reproduce within nucleated host cells. Studies using more advanced cell culture and molecular techniques are confirming the presence of previously undetected intracellular bacteria. Defense mechanisms that intracellular bacteria use to persist and proliferate need to be investigated. Pathogen-induced VDR dysfunction which causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines appears to be at the root of chronic disease and low 25(OH)D. Improving VDR activation may be the key to reducing inflammatory diseases. Treatments that up-regulate the VDR to restore normal immune function, reduce inflammation and eradicate persistent bacterial infections require further research. An immunotherapy which has demonstrated efficacy in reversing vitamin D metabolism dysfunction and reducing inflammatory symptoms is currently being used by clinicians and warrants formal study.
In summary, elevated 1,25(OH)2D, often accompanied by reduced 25(OH)D, is a clinical sign of dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and evidence that the immune system is competing with parasitic microbes for VDR dominance. Failure of the immune system to mount an effective anti-microbial response results in persistent intracellular infection. This induces relentless inflammation (immunopathology) which causes tissue damage and disease symptoms.

&lt;li>
&lt;p>There are some 10,000 biota in the human gut&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Antibiotics kills off gut biota. - sometimes being a species genocide (totally losing some contingency genes)&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Current probiotics will restock, at least for a few weeks 1-10 species.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Antibiotics early in life (while still developing) can have profound effects on the individual&amp;rsquo;s development, even if the species is later restocked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Probiotics reduced weight gain in mice for many weeks (proof of concept)</title><link>/posts/probiotics-reduced-weight-gain-in-mice-for-many-weeks-proof-of-concept.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/probiotics-reduced-weight-gain-in-mice-for-many-weeks-proof-of-concept.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Incorporation of therapeutically modified bacteria into gut microbiota inhibits obesity&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Deficiency of serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 has been correlated with increased risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. A plausible reason for this association is that expression of genes encoding important antimicrobial proteins depends on concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 produced by activated immune cells at sites of infection, and that synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is dependent on the availability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Thus, increasing the availability of 25(OH)D3 for immune cell synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at sites of infection has been hypothesized to aid in clearance of the infection. This report details the treatment of an acute intramammary infection with infusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to the site of infection.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tuberculosis, UV and perhaps vitamin D</title><link>/posts/tuberculosis-uv-and-perhaps-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/tuberculosis-uv-and-perhaps-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 class="svTitle">

&lt;p>The immune response to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB) varies between patients of different ethnic origin, according to a new UK study.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The study, published in the journal PLOS Pathogens and led by researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, analyzed the immune response of 128 newly-diagnosed TB patients in London who were divided by ethnicity into those of African (45), European (27), Asian (55) or mixed European/Asian (1) ancestry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Global Perspective - Holick</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-global-perspective-holick.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-global-perspective-holick.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It is now generally accepted that vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem that affects not only musculoskeletal health but also a wide range of acute and chronic diseases. However, there remains cynicism about the lack of randomized controlled trials to support the association studies regarding the nonskeletal health benefits of vitamin D. This review was obtained by searching English-language studies published up to April 1, 2013, in PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (search terms: vitamin D and supplementation) and focuses on recent challenges regarding the definition of vitamin D deficiency and how to achieve optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations from dietary sources, supplements, and sun exposure. The effect of vitamin D on fetal programming epigenetics and gene regulation could potentially explain why vitamin D has been reported to have such wide-ranging health benefits throughout life. There is potentially a great upside to increasing the vitamin D status of children and adults worldwide for improving musculoskeletal health and reducing the risk of chronic illnesses, including some cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurocognitive disorders, and mortality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypovitaminosis D in the Middle East and North Africa</title><link>/posts/hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 class="showhide_heading" id="Hypovitaminosis_D_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa:_Prevalence_risk_factors_and_impact_on_outcomes">

&lt;p>Acute lower respiratory infections, predominantly pneumonia, kill more children under the age of five in every region of the world 1 than any other cause. In 2007, of the estimated nine million child deaths that occurred globally, close to 20% or 1.8 million were attributable to pneumonia. Undernutrition has been shown to both increase the severity and overall prevalence of acute lower respiratory infections and is an important factor in determining the mortality rates from severe forms of respiratory infections1–4.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The vitamin D receptor and T cell function</title><link>/posts/the-vitamin-d-receptor-and-t-cell-function.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-vitamin-d-receptor-and-t-cell-function.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="span-stylecolor00ffigure-1--proposed-model-for-vdr-signaling-in-t-cells-span">&lt;span style="color:#00F;">FIGURE 1 | Proposed model for VDR signaling in T cells. &lt;/span>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>We have investigated whether low-dose vitamin K2 supplements (menaquinone-7, MK-7) could beneficially affect bone health. Next to an improved vitamin K status, MK-7 supplementation significantly decreased the age-related decline in bone mineral density and bone strength. Low-dose MK-7 supplements may therefore help postmenopausal women prevent bone loss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D suppressed by Roundup and Genes - CYP2R1, CYP24A1, CYP450 etc.</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-suppressed-by-roundup-and-genes-cyp2r1-cyp24a1-cyp450-etc.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-suppressed-by-roundup-and-genes-cyp2r1-cyp24a1-cyp450-etc.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Blue light has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. However, the use of blue light for wound infections has not been established yet. In this study, we demonstrated the efficacy of blue light at &lt;strong>415 nm&lt;/strong> for treatment of acute, potentially lethal Pseudomonas aeruginosa burn infections in mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that the inactivation rate of P. aeruginosa cells by blue light was approximately 35-fold faster than that of keratinocytes (P=0.0014). Transmission electron microscopy revealed blue light mediated intracellular damage to P. aeruginosa cells. Fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that coproporphyrin III or/and uroporphyrin III are possibly the intracellular photosensitive chromophores associated with the blue light inactivation of P. aeruginosa. In vivo studies using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging technique and the area-under-the-bioluminescence-time-curve (AUBC) analysis showed that a single exposure of blue light at 55.8 J/cm(2), applied 30 min after bacterial inoculation to the infected mouse burns, reduced the AUBC by an approximately 100-fold in comparison with untreated and infected mouse burns (P&amp;lt;0.0001). Histological analysis and TUNEL assay indicated no significant damages in the mouse skin exposed to blue light at the effective antimicrobial dose. Survival analysis revealed that blue light increased the survival rate of infected mice from &lt;strong>18.2% to 100%&lt;/strong> (P&amp;lt;0.0001). In conclusion, blue light therapy may offer an effective and safe alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapy for P. aeruginosa burn infections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypomagnesemia (low Magnesium) is very prevalent in ICU – 1999</title><link>/posts/hypomagnesemia-low-magnesium-is-very-prevalent-in-icu-1999.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypomagnesemia-low-magnesium-is-very-prevalent-in-icu-1999.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hypomagnesemia">Hypomagnesemia&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Hypomagnesemia is a common entity occurring in up to 12% of hospitalized patients (1). The incidence rises to as high as 60 to 65% in patients in intensive care settings in which nutrition, diuretics, hypoalbuminemia, and aminoglycosides may play important roles (2,3,4).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sunshine: Dangerous or Healthy – Schachter Center 2009</title><link>/posts/sunshine-dangerous-or-healthy-schachter-center-2009.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sunshine-dangerous-or-healthy-schachter-center-2009.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sunshine-dangerous-or-healthyhttpwwwschachtercentercomsunshinehtm20-2009">&lt;a href="http://www.schachtercenter.com/sunshine.htm%20">Sunshine: Dangerous or Healthy?&lt;/a> 2009&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>As with so many health topics in America, the public is often misinformed. Such is the case with the &amp;ldquo;health dangers of sunshine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-dangers-of-sun-exposure">The Dangers of Sun Exposure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently, some 600,000 new cases of skin cancer are reported every year.(1) Over the years, there have been numerous publications making the claim that sunshine exposure increases the risk of developing skin cancer as well as hastens aging of the skin. It would seem, therefore, that &amp;ldquo;avoiding the sun&amp;rdquo; would be an obvious response to this problem. It is believed that Ultraviolet A rays are the cause of hastened aging and skin cancer while the Ultraviolet B rays are the source of sunburn. The UVB rays are also the source for making Vitamin D in the skin. Melanomas are currently the tenth most common form of cancer in the U.S.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin A (Cod Liver Oil) blocks vitamin D – 2008</title><link>/posts/vitamin-a-cod-liver-oil-blocks-vitamin-d-2008.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-a-cod-liver-oil-blocks-vitamin-d-2008.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cod-liver-oil-vitamin-a-toxicity-frequent-respiratory-infections-and-the-vitamin-d-deficiency-epidemic">Cod Liver Oil, Vitamin A Toxicity, Frequent Respiratory Infections, and the Vitamin D Deficiency Epidemic&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Boosting levels of vitamin D with supplements has been touted to prevent diseases, but many scientists say only clinical trials now in the works can confirm such hopes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IN 1848, DOCTORS AT THE HOSPITAL FOR Consumption and Diseases of the Chest in London undertook &lt;strong>one of the world&amp;rsquo;s first clinical trials&lt;/strong> . More than 1000 patients with tuberculosis (TB) were either just cared for, as no effective treatment was known, or were also given a spoonful of cod-liver oil three times a day. Nineteen percent of patients on cod-liver oil deteriorated or died, compared to 33% in the control group.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The problems of vitamin d insufficiency in older people</title><link>/posts/the-problems-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-older-people.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-problems-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-older-people.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-problems-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-older-people">The problems of vitamin d insufficiency in older people.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This report reviews evidence on disorders related to inadequate vitamin D repletion in older people. Vitamin D is as essential for bone health in adults as in children, preventing osteomalacia and muscle weakness and protecting against falls and low-impact fractures. Vitamin D is provided by skin synthesis by UVB-irradiation from summer sunshine and to a small extent by absorption from food. However, these processes become less efficient with age. Loss of mobility or residential care restricts solar exposure. Reduced appetite and financial problems often add to these problems. Thus, hypovitaminosis D is common world-wide, but is more common and more severe in older people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Respiratory infections reduced by 63 percent with 4000 IU vitamin D daily - RCT</title><link>/posts/respiratory-infections-reduced-by-63-percent-with-4000-iu-vitamin-d-daily-rct.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/respiratory-infections-reduced-by-63-percent-with-4000-iu-vitamin-d-daily-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="highlights-of-report-in-swedishhttpwwwdagensmedicinsenyhetervitamin-d-bromsade-luftvagsinfektioner-translated-bygoogle">Highlights of &lt;a href="http://www.dagensmedicin.se/nyheter/vitamin-d-bromsade-luftvagsinfektioner/">Report in Swedish&lt;/a> translated by Google&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Peter Bergman and his colleagues are fortunate to have 140 patients in daily treatment for one year with either vitamin D (4000 IU) or a placebo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The study was double-blind: neither the patients - all of which were susceptible to infections - nor caregivers knew who belonged to which group before the trial was over.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The results show that vitamin D reduced patient discomfort.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nov 2012 Vitamin D News email</title><link>/posts/nov-2012-vitamin-d-news-email.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/nov-2012-vitamin-d-news-email.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="this-page-is-on-the-web--a-hrefpostsvitamindwiki-stylecolor-red-text-decoration-underline-titlethis-link-has-an-unknown-page_id-3485vitamindwikia">This page is on the web &lt;a href="/posts/vitamindwiki" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 3485">VitaminDWiki&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
