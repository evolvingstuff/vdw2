* [Introduction to Kawasaki Disease: Discover About This Illness That Primarily Affects Children](https://articles.mercola.com/kawasaki-disease.aspx?utm_source=dnl&utm_medium=email&utm_content=secon&utm_campaign=20180828Z1_UCM&et_cid=DM231077&et_rid=404851681) Mercola Aug 2018, nice overview, no mention of Vitamin D

#### KD has had a recent seasonal cycle

which has gotten worse as vitamin D levels have been dropping

Note: the KD season is now in Winter-Spring - when vitamin D levels are the lowest

Note: very little connection between the winds(mentioned below) and KD before vitamin D levels became very low

chart from http://www.nature.com/news/infectious-disease-blowing-in-the-wind-1.10374

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/kd-seasonal-cycle.jpg" alt="image" width="700">

 **<span style="color:#F00;">KD  is the red line</span>** 

 **Wonder if the winds cause such pollution that Japanese the children stay indoors and thus get less vitamin D?** 

---

#### VitaminDWiki reasons to suspect that KD can be prevented with Vitamin D supplementation

1. KD increases during the season which has the lowest vitamin D levels

1. KD affects those with dark skins more (dark skin carries a high risk of being vitamin D deficient when away from the tropics)

1. KD is an autoimmune disease - many of which can be prevented or treated by Vitamin D

1. KD has increased 2X in a decade - like 30 other diseases associated with low vitamin D

#### Snips  from Wikipedia entry – with VitaminDWiki comments

* Autoimmune inflammation of lymph nodes

* Without treatment, mortality may approach 1%

* It is difficult to establish the diagnosis, especially early in the course of the illness, 

> and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have seen several healthcare providers

* May be associated with liver inflammation (which can be the cause of low vitamin D)

* Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls, 

> with people of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese and Korean people, most susceptible, 

> as well as people of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. (darker skin ==> lower vitamin D)

* The disease was rare in Caucasians until the last few decades, 

> (perhaps increase with recent lower levels of vitamin D) and incidence rate fluctuates from country to country

* more than one in 150 children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during their lifetimes.

* 80% of patients younger than five years of age

* US incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000

> which is yet another indication of vitamin D association:

> see VitaminDWiki [Incidence of 22 health problems related to vitamin D have doubled in a decade](/posts/incidence-of-22-health-problems-related-to-vitamin-d-have-doubled-in-a-decade)

* it appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children

> More cases in winter in spring (times when vitamin D levels are the lowest)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">(Note by VitaminDWiki: KD appears to be an orphan disease in US (but not in Japan 1 in 150)</span>**
