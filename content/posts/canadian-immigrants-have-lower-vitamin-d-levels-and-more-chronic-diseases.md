Background: Nearly 22% of the Canadian population are first-generation immigrants. We investigated immigrants’ health status and health deterioration over time in terms of the prevalence of chronic diseases (CDs) and their relationship to vitD status. 

Methods: We used cycles three (2012–2013) and four (2014–2015) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey. These data contained unique health information and direct physical/blood measures, including serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D). Indicators of health status and deterioration were the prevalence of CDs diagnosed by healthcare professionals, self-reported general and mental health, and CD-related biomarkers. 

Results: The data (n = 11,579) included immigrants from more than 153 countries. Immigrants were healthier than non-immigrants for most health status measures. 

The prevalence of CDs was higher among those who migrated to Canada aged ≥ 18 years. 

A longer time in Canada after immigration was associated with a higher risk for CDs. The mean S-25(OH)D was lower among immigrants, higher among patients with CDs, and inversely associated with glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, immunoglobulin E, serum ferritin, and blood hemoglobin. After adjusting for covariates, no association was found between S-25(OH)D and the prevalence of CDs.

Conclusions: Lower levels of accumulated S-25(OH)D among immigrants may impact their health profile in terms of CD-related biomarkers, which partially explains immigrants’ health deterioration over time. We recommend further longitudinal research to investigate immigrants’ vitD and health deterioration.
