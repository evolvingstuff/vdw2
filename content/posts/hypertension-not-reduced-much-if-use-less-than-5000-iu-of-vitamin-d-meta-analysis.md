 **Highlights** 

• Vitamin D deficiency is severe worldwide and has become a major public health problem in all age groups.

• This meta-analysis included seven randomized controlled trials that examined whether vitamin D supplementation can affect blood pressure parameters in 560 vitamin D–deficient participants.

• There is a small but significant fall in peripheral blood pressure through vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D–deficient subjects.

• Central blood pressure parameters cannot be significantly affected by vitamin D supplementation.

Evidence suggests that supplementation of vitamin D cannot decrease blood pressure in normal populations. However, in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with vitamin D deficient participants (defined as baseline serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels <30 ng/mL or 50 nmol/L), this effect is inconsistent and under debate. Thus, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation could affect blood pressure parameters in vitamin D–deficient subjects. The PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane library databases were searched. Extracted data were pooled as weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the effects. Subgroup analysis was further conducted according to the characteristics of included studies. Seven RCTs that contained 560 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled weighted mean difference of peripheral diastolic blood pressure was −1.65 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: −3.05 to −0.25, I2 = 30.3%). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation was found on other parameters. Subgroup analysis showed a significant decrease in peripheral systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in Asia, 8 weeks of intervention, and more than  **5000 IU of daily vitamin D**  supplementation subgroups. For vitamin D–deficient patients, there is a small but significant fall in peripheral blood pressure but no significant fall in other blood pressure parameters with vitamin D supplementation. Further RCTs with large numbers of participants is still warranted to confirm these effects.
