Ear Nose Throat J . 2022 Nov 11; [doi: 10.1177/01455613221137224](https://doi.org/10.1177/01455613221137224)

Objectives: Vitamin D (VD) plays role in wound healing and protection against infections. The relationship between plasma VD level and the outcomes of Type 1 tympanoplasty (T1T) has not been studied before

Methods: A total of 101 patients with chronic otitis media scheduled for T1T were divided into four groups in relation with their VD levels as severe insufficiency, insufficiency, mild-to-modest deficiency and optimal VD level groups. Graft success, hearing improvement and postoperative infection rates were compared among the groups in 12-month follow-up period.

Results: The graft success rate (P = 0.014) and air-bone gap gain (P = 0.004) were significantly higher, and postoperative infection rate was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in optimal VD level group.

Conclusion: 25-OH VD deficiency should be considered as a factor for failure in T1T. VD replacement may increase success of tympanoplasty in patients with low preoperative serum VD levels.
