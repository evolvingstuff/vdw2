Anemia in older adults is a growing public health issue in Mexico; however, its etiology remains largely unknown. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and vitamin D deficiency (VDD) have been implicated in the development of anemia, though by different mechanisms. The aim of this study is to analyze the etiology of anemia and anemia-related factors in older Mexican adults. This is a cross-sectional study of 803 older adults from the southern region of Mexico in 2015. The anemia etiologies analyzed were chronic kidney disease (CKD), nutritional deficiencies (ND), anemia of inflammation (AI), anemia of multiple causes (AMC) and unexplained anemia (UEA). VAD was considered to be s-retinol ≤ 20 μg/dL, and VDD if 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L. IL-6 and hepcidin were also measured. Multinomial regression models were generated and adjusted for confounders. Anemia was present in 35.7% of OA, independent of sex. UEA, CKD, AI and ND were confirmed in 45%, 29.3%, 14.6% and 7% of older adults with anemia, respectively. Hepcidin and log IL-6 were associated with AI (p < 0.05) and CKD (p < 0.001). VAD was associated with AI (p < 0.001), and VDD with ND and AMC (p < 0.05). Log-IL6 was associated with UEA (p < 0.001). In conclusion, anemia in older adults has an inflammatory component. VAD was associated to AI and VDD with ND and AMC.
