#### Earthing experience by a person who has MS AND treats people with MS - June 2019** Personalized Vitamin D3 For MS With Michael Cawley, Facebook: **"Greetings from Sunny Mallorca! Three weeks ago I read Clint Obers book on the medical benefits of free electrons from the Earth via grounding. What grabbed my interest was the amount of people with auto immune diseases reporting a sustained reduction of symptoms from daily grounding. I bought a Clint Ober bed mat and brought it with me to Spain. After about 10 days I noticed my energy and sense of vitality had improved. I love to walk in the hills here but since a relapse 3 years ago my legs prefer not to walk for more than 2 hours. This year on the 2 hour walks my legs felt like normal and I decided to do a walk I thought I would never do again. It is a 5 hour walk with a 400 meter elevation which is intense. I set off at 9 am and enjoyed a peaceful wander in the hills. My legs and energy were perfect and I felt like I had a new body.

I was grounded (verified) by socket tester for** 9 hours a night and two hours a day **with bare feet on soil for 12 days before this walk. 

When I reduce my grounding to 9 hours a day I notice my vitality and robustness decline. The benefits from Earthing are dose dependent, after 15 years of clinical observation Clint Ober says the more the better ( with the exception of Lyme disease). I recommend everyone to read Clint Ober’s Earthing book and study carefully the wide range of scientific studies that have been performed regarding earthings benefits. 

* 1) Reduces stress hormones. Calming effect. 

* 2) Positively effects Autonomic nervous system. 

* 3) Improves the viscosity of blood. Reduces risk of blood clots. 

* 4) Reduces elevated blood pressure. 

* 5 ) Reduces inflammation and chronic pain.

* 6) Increases the bodies ability to cope with severe physical exertion and overwork.

* 7) Promotes better sleep and eases chronic digestive issues.

I am still on vacation but will post more upon my return. Wishing everyone a peaceful day ! Michael".
