#### Consensus on the following:

* UV radiation at the ground consists mainly of UVA, some UVB, and a tiny amount of UVC

* Sun, sunbeds/tanning beds/some sun bulbs contain both UVA and UVB radiation

* UVA (315 -400 nm) radiation induces pigment tanning within seconds of UVA and light exposure

   * UVA tanning fades within 2 hours and does not increase melanin in skin

* UVB (280-315 nm) radiation

   * induces  vitamin D synthesis

   * delayed tanning (increases melanin in skin after several days)

   * is mainly responsible for sunburn (erythema), photoaging, photoimmunosuppression

* Windows (glass) block UVB radiation

* Modern sunscreens block UVB and UVA, but some of them block UVA poorly or are photo-unstable in this region

* There has been an increase in melanoma incidence in recent years

   * [Cancer Research on Skin Mortality](http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/skin/mortality/)

   * [IARC reference](http://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5plus/ci5plus.htm)

* Tanning beds produce higher levels of UVA radiation than the sun - even at the equator 

* UVB radiation, but not UVA radiation, induces melanoma in  **genetically modified animals** 

   * The newest epidemiological evidence suggest that UVA as well as UVB is associated with human melanoma

* Epidemiological studies published over the last years demonstrated the association between sunbed use and melanoma.

* Many countries restrict the amount of UVB (vitamin D) from tanning beds (due to mouse study) 

* UVB decreases faster than UVA when far from equator or winter season

#### Confusion/Disagreement

Sunburn (Erythema), cataracts, and development of skin cancer are related mostly to UVB radiation.

Ban all people under age 18 from using tanning beds 

Increase alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increased melanoma (see bottom of page)

#### Note: After skin cancer diagnosis, internal cancer rates often increase due to sun phobia

#### Clipped from [SkinCheck org](http://www.skincheck.org/Page5.htm) Where does Melanoma occur

* Anywhere, including places never exposed to the sun.

* In Caucasian males, the most common location is the trunk (especially the back).

* In Caucasian females, the most common locations are the legs (especially the back of lower legs) and trunk.

* Among Asians, Hispanics, and African-Americans, the most common locations are the feet and hands.

   * Skin is lighter (less melatonin), so more UVB can damage the feet and hands

#### Germany also considers that adding vitamin D might reduce melanoma

 **Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels in a large German cohort of melanoma patients.** 

Br J Dermatol. 2012 Aug 9. [doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2012.11212.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2012.11212.x.) 

Gambichler T, Bindsteiner M, Höxtermann S, Kreuter A.

Department of Dermatology, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

Background:? Observational studies have suggested that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is associated with better outcomes in patients with malignant melanoma (MM). 

Objectives:? To study the relationship between serum 25OHD levels and clinical parameters in a large German cohort of MM patients. 

Methods:? We prospectively investigated the 25OHD serum levels of 764 MM patients using the direct competitive chemiluminescence LIAISON® immunoassay. 

 **MM patients taking 25OHD supplements were not included.** 

Results:? Median serum 25OHD baseline levels were 12.3 ng/ml (lower quartile: 7.3 ng/ml, upper quartile: 20.2 ng/ml). 564 (764/73.8%) patients had 25OHD deficiency (25OHD < 20 ng/ml), 188 (764/18.8%) had 25OHD insufficiency (25OHD ? 20 < 30 ng/ml), and only 55 (764/ **7.2%) patients had serum 25OHD levels within the normal range**  (? 30 ng/ml). Using a multiple regression model, lower 25OHD levels were significantly associated with higher Breslow tumour thickness (class: < 1 mm; ? 1 - 4 mm; > 4 mm: regression coefficient -1.45, P = 0.028) and higher AJCC 2002 melanoma stage (regression coefficient: -0.79, P = 0.036). 

Conclusions:? In MM patients, decreased 25OHD serum levels are associated with increased tumour thickness and advanced tumour stage. 

 **Hence, evidence is accumulating that patients with MM might benefit from 25OHD supplements.**

#### [Sunshine: Dangerous or Healthy?](http://www.schachtercenter.com/sunshine.htm) 2009

* Comment in a NYT interview of Dr. Bernard Ackerman, Demratoligist, who has authored 600 papers

> "the field is just replete with nonsense." For example, Dr. Ackerman does not believe that the link between melanoma and sun exposure (a central dogma of dermatology) has been proven. 

> He is deeply tanned and is not afraid to expose his body to the sun. Dr. Ackerman does, however, recommend that folks avoid excessive skin exposure to avoid premature aging of the skin.

> He also does not believe that sunburn, even the kind that causes blistering of the skin, necessarily leads to cancer later in life. 

> Basically, according to Dr. Ackerman, "the research is inconsistent and fails to make the case."

#### [Alcohol and Melanoma: More Proof that this Deadly Skin Cancer is not caused by Sunlight](http://www.sunlightinstitute.org/alcohol-and-melanoma-more-proof-deadly-skin-cancer-not-caused-sunlight%20)

 **Sunlight Institute, Nov 2013** 

* 1993 study:  women who drank two or more drinks per day had an increased risk of melanoma of  **250%** .

* Oct 2013 study 

> (1) 7+ drinks per week had a **64%**  increased risk of melanoma;

> (2) higher lifetime alcohol consumption was positively correlated to risk of the disease; 

> (3) higher current alcohol consumption similarly correlated to a higher risk: 

> (4) current alcohol intake also predicted higher risk;

> (5) a preference for white wine or liquor also predicted increased risk. 

* Sunlight Instutiute refutes the claim that melanoma is caused by sunlight

> Year-long study in Australia using 500 milligrams of nicotinamide twice a day

> Vitamin B3 provides skin cells with a boost of energy and intensifies the rate of skin repair.

> "It's safe, it's almost obscenely inexpensive and it's widely available,"

> People who haven't been diagnosed with such cancers should not take nicotinamide preventively, she said.

> Results will be presented in late May 2015 at American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago
