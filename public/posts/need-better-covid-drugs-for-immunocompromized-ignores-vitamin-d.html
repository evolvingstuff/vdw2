* &quot;While people with working immune systems can typically clear SARS-CoV-2 within days, those who are immunocompromised may continue to harbor and  **shed the virus for longer, even without symptoms. They also often receive multiple antiviral treatments over time, which may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant variants.**  This represents a big problem for society as they can become places for the virus to mutate and grow and spread.&quot;
