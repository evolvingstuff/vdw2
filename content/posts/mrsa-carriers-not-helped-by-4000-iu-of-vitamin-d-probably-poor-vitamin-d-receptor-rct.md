 **Whereas for several Cancers  
Cancer ==> Poor Vitamin D Receptor &nbsp; &nbsp; that is, a Cancer has learned how to deactive the local VDR**

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics and can cause severe infections that are difficult to treat. Eradication strategies with conventional antibiotics are not always effective and alternative approaches are warranted. Here, we tested the hypothesis that daily supplementation with vitamin D for 12 months would reduce MRSA carriage rates among a group of persistent carriers. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial with n = 65 persistent MRSA carriers with 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 (25OHD) < 75 nmol/L, who were followed up with bacterial cultures at baseline and every 3 months for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the decline in MRSA positivity during the study period. The study was conducted in two MRSA outpatient clinics at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. In total, n = 65 persistent MRSA carriers were randomized and n = 3 were lost to follow-up. Only patients deficient in vitamin D (< 75 nmol/L) were included. Vitamin D (4000 IU) or placebo/day was administered for 12 months. The decline in MRSA positivity was equal in the vitamin D and placebo group during the study period (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03; p = 0.928) and approximately 40% in both groups were MRSA-negative after 12 months. The vitamin D group produced 103 positive cultures out of 318 cultures (32.4%) from nose, throat, and perineum over the study period, whereas the placebo group produced 135/393 positive cultures (34.0%) (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.94). Vitamin D supplementation did not influence MRSA carriage. Thus, available data does not support vitamin D supplementation to persistent MRSA carriers.

#### People with healthy guts have far larger responses to 4,000 IU of vitamin D than those with MRSA
