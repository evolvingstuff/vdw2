#### VITAMIN D AND STILLBIRTH -OP No. 20

Anticancer Research May 2024, 44 (5) 2249-2268; DOI: https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.17034

Presented at Proceedings of the Joint International Symposia: Vitamin D in Prevention and Therapy and Biologic Effects of Light May 04-06, 2022 Schlossberg Hotel, Homburg/Saar, Germany

Pelle G. Lindqvist Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden

Background/Aim: Two retrospective studies of prospective cohorts showed doubled odds of birth asphyxia among women with low plasma vitamin D levels and one reported a 4-fold increase in the odds of stillbirth. It was not known if this was caused by low sun exposure or by vitamin D per se. 

Patients and Methods: The stillbirth rate, including all pregnancies in Finland and Sweden between 1994 to 2021 (n>4 million), was analysed. Due to 50% of the population having low plasma vitamin D, Finland implemented an extensive National Vitamin D fortification program in 2003, which was doubled in 2009 due to an insufficient effect. After 2009, only 10% had low vitamin D levels. Stillbirth rates were compared using cross-tabulation with 95% confidence intervals. 

Results: Stillbirth rate decreased from 4.1% before 2003 to 3.2% to 2.% after 2009. Meanwhile, the Swedish stillbirth rate remained constant at 3.9% untill 2018 when the Finish fortification was implemented in Sweden. Thereafter, it decreased to 3.2%. All results had p<0.001. 

Conclusion: In our large study of National vitamin D fortification, improved vitamin D status was associated with a lower stillbirth rate in a dose-dependent manner.

!!!!VITAMIN D AND STILLBIRTH -OP No. 20
Anticancer Research May 2024, 44 (5) 2249-2268; DOI: https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.17034
Presented at Proceedings of the Joint International Symposia: Vitamin D in Prevention and Therapy and Biologic Effects of Light May 04-06, 2022 Schlossberg Hotel, Homburg/Saar, Germany
Pelle G. Lindqvist Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden

Background/Aim: Two retrospective studies of prospective cohorts showed doubled odds of birth asphyxia among women with low plasma vitamin D levels and one reported a 4-fold increase in the odds of stillbirth. It was not known if this was caused by low sun exposure or by vitamin D per se. 

Patients and Methods: The stillbirth rate, including all pregnancies in Finland and Sweden between 1994 to 2021 (n&gt;4 million), was analysed. Due to 50% of the population having low plasma vitamin D, Finland implemented an extensive National Vitamin D fortification program in 2003, which was doubled in 2009 due to an insufficient effect. After 2009, only 10% had low vitamin D levels. Stillbirth rates were compared using cross-tabulation with 95% confidence intervals. 

Results: Stillbirth rate decreased from 4.1% before 2003 to 3.2% to 2.% after 2009. Meanwhile, the Swedish stillbirth rate remained constant at 3.9% untill 2018 when the Finish fortification was implemented in Sweden. Thereafter, it decreased to 3.2%. All results had p&lt;0.001. 

Conclusion: In our large study of National vitamin D fortification, improved vitamin D status was associated with a lower stillbirth rate in a dose-dependent manner.
