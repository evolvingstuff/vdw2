# Cross-Sectional and Prospective Cohort Study of Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Level and Obesity in Adults: The HUNT Study.

Am J Epidemiol. 2012 Feb 6. 

Mai XM, Chen Y, Camargo CA Jr, Langhammer A.

Experimental studies suggest that vitamin D modulates the activity of adipocytes. The authors examined baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in relation to prevalent and cumulative incident obesity in Norway. 

A cohort of 25,616 adults aged 19-55 years participated in both the second and third surveys of the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Health Study (HUNT 2 (1995-1997) and HUNT 3 (2006-2008)). Serum 25(OH)D levels measured at baseline and anthropometric measurements taken at both baseline and follow-up were available for a random sample of 2,460 subjects. 

Overall, 40% of the 2,460 subjects had a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L, and 37% had a level of 50.0-74.9 nmol/L. 

The prevalence and cumulative incidence of obesity, defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) ?30, were 12% and 15%, respectively. 

Lower serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a higher prevalence of obesity. 

In the 2,165 subjects with baseline BMI less than 30, a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L was associated with a significantly increased odds ratio for incident obesity during follow-up (adjusted odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 2.41). 

When prevalent and incident obesity were classified according to waist circumference (?88 cm for women, ?102 cm for men), similar results were obtained. In addition to prevalent obesity, a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L was significantly associated with new-onset obesity in adults.

* [Overview Obesity and Vitamin D](/posts/overview-obesity-and-vitamin-d) summary follows from as of Feb 2012

 **FACT:**  People who are obese have less vitamin D in their blood

 **FACT:**   People who are obese need a <a href="/posts/higher-dose-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1300">higher dose of vitamin D</a> to get to the same level of vitamin D in their blood

 **FACT:**   When obese people lose weight the vitamin D level in their blood increases

 **FACT:**   Adding Calcium, perhaps in the form of fortified milk, often reduces weight

 **OBSERVATION:**  About 30% of obese quickly lose weight when they take >2000 IU of vitamin D and 750 mg Calcium

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Women lose weight, men have not been tested

 **SUGGESTION:**  Probably need much more than 2,000 IU to lose weight if very low on vitamin D (high risk) due to
