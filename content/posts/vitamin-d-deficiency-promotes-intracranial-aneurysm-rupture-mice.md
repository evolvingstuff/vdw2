Intracranial aneurysm rupture causes severe disability and high mortality. Epidemiological studies show a strong association between decreased vitamin D levels and an increase in aneurysm rupture. However, the causality and mechanism remain largely unknown. In this study, we tested whether vitamin D deficiency promotes aneurysm rupture and examined the underlying mechanism for the protective role of vitamin D against the development of aneurysm rupture utilizing a mouse model of intracranial aneurysm. 

Mice consuming a vitamin D-deficient diet had a higher rupture rate than mice with a regular diet. Vitamin D deficiency increased proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebral arteries. Concurrently, vitamin D receptor knockout mice had a higher rupture rate than the corresponding wild-type littermates. The vitamin D receptors on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, but not on hematopoietic cells, mediated the effect of aneurysm rupture. Our results establish that vitamin D protects against the development of aneurysmal rupture through the vitamin D receptors on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Vitamin D supplementation may be a viable pharmacologic therapy for preventing aneurysm rupture.

##### Note:  Intracranial aneurysm rupture is somewhat similar but different from a Hemorrhagic Stroke

Example: Only 50% of the incidence, but far more deadly
