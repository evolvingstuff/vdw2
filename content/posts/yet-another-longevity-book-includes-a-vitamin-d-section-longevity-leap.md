Aging and longevity are something humans have been thinking about throughout our history. Life expectancies worldwide are increasing and people are living longer than ever before. This raises the question, how do you maintain a higher quality of life even when living longer? Furthermore, how long could you live if you were to follow all the latest science about longevity and slowing down aging?

Life is equal to time - how much time you are alive. How much time you have is equal to your longevity intelligence - understanding your health, genetic risk factors, major risk factors to mortality, and how to improve one's health. The Longevity Leap is a guide to increasing longevity intelligence - to slow biological aging and add healthy years to your life. Containing over 8000, references to scientific articles and studies, The Longevity Leap is an evidence-based overview of the biology of aging, chronic diseases that kill most people, and practical lifestyle routines that have been proven to improve your health and slow down aging.

 **Siim Land**  is a best-selling author, speaker, and anthropologist from Estonia. He's written over **8 books on nutrition, fitness, health, and exercise** . Ever since childhood, Siim has been interested in anthropology and human development. As an adult, he decided to take his longevity seriously to prevent dying at a young age like his grandfather did. The Longevity Leap is Siim's magnum opus - a personal evidence-based guide to Siim's health and longevity.
