This report does not make nor was it <font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>intended to make recommendations for DRI values concerning vitamin D or calcium. </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>Responsibility for setting DRI values lies with the Committee. Evidence from systematic reviews is one of several types of information available to the Committee for use in its deliberations to </font>establish DRI values. This is the first time that an independent systematic review is being <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>commissioned to support the DRI process. Thus, it is important for users of this report to fully appreciate the nuances of the methodologies employed, as well as the strengths and limitations of </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>this approach. In particular, it should be noted that total vitamin D exposure was not evaluated in </font>this report because there is no valid method to quantify the contribution of endogenous vitamin<font style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:12pt;letter-spacing:-.2pt"></font></p><p style=text-indent:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:.05in><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>D synthesis resulting from sun exposure and it is also the TEP’s consensus that vitamin D intake, </font>as estimated by current food frequency questionnaires, is too inaccurate to be of value.</p><p style=margin-right:.05in;margin-top:1.8pt><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>For this report, we identified 165 primary articles that met the eligibility criteria established </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt>by the TEP. In addition, we included 11 published systematic reviews that incorporated over 200 </font>additional primary articles. Despite the relatively large number of studies included, with the <font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>following few exceptions, </font><font style="background:#ff9 repeat;letter-spacing:-.2pt">it is difficult to make any substantive and concise statements on the </font><font style="background:#ff9 repeat;letter-spacing:-.3pt">basis of the available evidence</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt> concerning the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration, </font>supplemental vitamin D, dietary calcium intake, or the combination of both nutrients with the <font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt>various health outcomes. It proved challenging because many of the studies contained substantial </font>heterogeneity and their findings were inconsistent for the health outcomes examined.</p><p style=margin-right:.05in><font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt>In general, among RCTs of hypertensive adults, calcium supplementation (400 to 2000 mg/d) </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>lowered systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by a small but statistically significant amount </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>(2 to 4 mm Hg).</font></p><p style=margin-right:.2in><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>For body weight, despite a wide range of calcium intakes (from supplements or from dairy </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>and nondairy sources) across the calcium trials, the RCTs were fairly consistent in finding no </font>significant effect of increased calcium intake on body weight.</p><p style=margin-right:.05in><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>For growth, a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs did not find a significant effect on weight and height </font>gain attributable to calcium supplement in children ranged from 3 to 18 years of age.</p><p style=margin-right:.05in;text-align:justify><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>For bone health, one well-conducted systematic review of RCTs found that vitamin D</font><font style=font-size:7.5pt;letter-spacing:-.3pt>3 </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>(up to </font><font style="background:#ff9 repeat;letter-spacing:-.3pt">800 IU/d) plus calcium (~500 mg/d) </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>supplementation resulted in </font><font style="background:#ff9 repeat;letter-spacing:-.3pt">small increases in BMD</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt> of the </font>spine, total body, femoral neck, and total hip in populations consisting predominantly of women <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>in late menopause.</font></p><p><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>For breast cancer, subgroup analyses in four cohort studies consistently found that calcium </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>intake in the range of 780 to 1750 mg/d in premenopausal women was associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. However, no RCTs of calcium supplementation to prevent </font>breast cancer in premenopausal women have been published. In contrast, cohort studies of <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>postmenopausal women are consistent in showing no association of calcium intake with the risk </font>of breast cancer.</p><p><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>For prostate cancer, three of four cohort studies found significant associations between </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>higher calcium intake (>1500 or >2000 mg/day) and increased risk of prostate cancer, compared </font>to men consuming lower amount of calcium (500-1000 mg/day).</p><p style=margin-right:.15in><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>For cardiovascular events, a cohort study and a nested case-control study found associations </font>between lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations (less than either about 50 or 75 nmol/L) and <font style=letter-spacing:0>increased risk of total cardiovascular events; however an RCT found no effect of </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>supplementation and studies of specific cardiovascular events were too sparse to reach </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>conclusions. Taken together, six cohort studies of calcium intake suggest that in populations at </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>relatively increased risk of stroke and with relatively low dietary calcium intake (i.e., in East </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>Asia), lower levels of calcium intake under about 700 mg/day are associated with higher risk of </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>stroke. This association, however, was not replicated in Europe or the US, and one Finnish study </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>found a possible association of increased risk of stroke in men with calcium intakes above 1000 </font><font style=letter-spacing:0>mg.</font></p><p>Studies on the association between either serum 25(OH)D concentration or calcium intake and other forms of cancer (colorectum, pancreas, prostate, all-cause); incidence of hypertension <font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>or specific cardiovascular disease events; immunologic disorders; and pregnancy-related </font>outcomes including preeclampsia were either few in number or reported inconsistent findings. <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>Too few studies of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation have been conducted to </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>allow adequate conclusions about its possible effects on health. The WHI trial was commonly </font>the only evidence available for a given outcome.</p><p style=text-indent:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center;margin-top:10.8pt><font style=font-family:Arial;font-size:16pt;letter-spacing:-.3pt><b>Strengths of This Report</b></font></p><p style=margin-right:0;margin-top:10.8pt><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>The strengths of this report lie in the wide range of topics covered, critical appraisal, detailed </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>documentation, transparent methods to assess the scientific literature, and an unbiased selection </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>of studies. A team of evidence-based methodologists not previously directly involved in research </font><font style=letter-spacing:0>related to vitamin D and calcium worked with nutrient experts to refine the key questions </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>(initially defined by AHRQ with input from various sponsors), analytic framework, and review </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>criteria for the systematic review. After defining the questions and eligibility criteria with input </font><font style=letter-spacing:0>from content experts and the sponsoring agencies, the Tufts EPC reviewed the published </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>evidence on the topic. The intent was to perform a thorough and unbiased systematic review of the literature base on available evidence as defined by prespecified criteria. Once the review </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>process began, input from experts in the field was sought to clarify technical questions during the literature review process. These individuals did not participate in study selection or detailed data </font>extraction from the included studies nor were any members serving on the IOM committee on vitamin D and calcium involved in the review of this document. A quality rating as detailed in <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>Chapter 2 (Methods section) was assigned for each primary study and systematic review, and incorporated into the data summaries section of the report. On the basis of this work, a sound </font>foundation has been created which will facilitate rapid and efficient future updates as needed.</p><p><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>Details concerning the process of question formulation, selection of health outcomes of interest, justification for study selection criteria, methods used for critical appraisals of studies and quality rating, and summary of results are described fully in the Methods chapter. This </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>approach is critical to the establishment of a transparent and reproducible process. Furthermore, </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>important variables that affect vitamin D status such as life stages, latitude of the study locale, </font>background diet and skin pigmentation are documented in this review.</p><p style=margin-right:.05in>This evidence report was carried out under the AHRQ EPC program, which has a 12-year <font style=letter-spacing:0>history of producing over 175 evidence reports and numerous technology assessments for </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>various users including many federal agencies. EPCs are staffed by experienced methodologists who continuously refine approaches to conducting systematic reviews and develop new methods </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>on the basis of accumulated experience encompassing a wide range of topics. In addition, the </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>Tufts EPC has conducted a number of nutrition-related evidence reports</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt><sup><font style=font-size:9.6pt>19-22,241</font></sup></font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>, as well as</font> <font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt>conducted the mock exercise on vitamin A panel.</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt><sup><font style=font-size:9.6pt>3</font></sup></font><font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt> This report drew on these experiences, the </font>expertise of the TEP, and the support of federal agencies.</p><p style=text-indent:0;margin-left:0;text-align:center;margin-top:14.4pt><font style=font-family:Arial;font-size:16pt;letter-spacing:-.4pt><b>DRI and the Literature on Vitamin D and Calcium</b></font></p><p style=margin-right:0;margin-top:12.6pt><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>It should be emphasized that none of the studies reviewed were designed to address issues </font>specifically relevant for establishing DRI values (i.e., to ascertain the optimal dose in a particular <font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>life stage to promote growth and tissue maintenance, and prevent chronic disease throughout the </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>lifecycle). In general, the studies did not enroll subjects with ages that could be easily mapped to </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>specific life stages as defined within the DRI framework (with the exception of postmenopausal </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>women and pregnant or lactating women) and did not evaluate health outcomes on the basis of </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>what doses will lower risk for a particular disease in prespecified life stages. Therefore, data will need to be extrapolated from these studies to craft a set of DRI values for vitamin D and calcium. This extrapolation may prove challenging.</font></p><p style=margin-right:0;margin-top:1.8pt><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>Certain issues concerning the studies of vitamin D must be noted. As mentioned previously, </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>it is difficult to evaluate nutritional adequacy because there are no methods currently available to quantify the contribution of endogenous vitamin D synthesis resulting from sun exposure on an </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>individual or group level. In addition, it is generally accepted that estimating intake by dietary </font>assessments is not a valid indicator of vitamin D status, because there are limitations in the completeness of nutrient databases for both food and dietary supplements vitamin D content and <font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>the rapidly changing landscape of vitamin D food fortification has not yet been captured in either </font><font style=letter-spacing:0>instruments used to assess intake and the databases used to analyze the data. For example, </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>vitamin D values are available for only about 600 out of 1400 foods in the USDA National </font>Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (<a style=color:#00f href=http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata)><font style=color:#00f><u>http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata)</u></font></a> and notably <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>missing are foods recently fortified with vitamin D.</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt><sup><font style=font-size:9.6pt>25</font></sup></font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt> Given the recent trend towards increased </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>nutrient fortification of the North American food supply, the lag in updating food composition </font>tables, and the inability to distinguish between fortified and unfortified foods when using most <font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>dietary assessment tools, it is difficult to accurately estimate dietary intakes of vitamin D, </font>especially for a given year. Shifts in methodological approaches to measure serum 25(OH)D <font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>concentrations, the heterogeneous nature of the data available with respect to study locations </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>(i.e., latitude) and times during the year (i.e., season) hamper our ability to succinctly summarize </font><font style=letter-spacing:.1pt>dose-response relationships. We did not perform a dose-response meta-analysis of the </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and health outcomes because limited and </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>inconsistent data would result in a meta-analysis that is difficult to interpret and results that may </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>be misleading. Furthermore, many of the large cohorts analyzed for associations of vitamin D </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>with health outcomes enrolled mostly white participants aged approximately 40 to 70 years old and much of the data on intake dose-response and serum 25(OH)D concentration were derived </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>from studies designed to measure bone health in postmenopausal women. These factors limit the </font>applicability of the findings to other life stages and other racial groups.</p><p style=margin-right:0><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>Unlike serum 25(OH)D concentrations for vitamin D, there is no equivalent serum biomarker </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>to indicate calcium status. Relying on dietary assessment to gauge calcium intake is limited by </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>the confounding effect of vitamin D status on the efficiency of calcium absorption and </font>uncertainties in the calcium content of many foods due to the recent trend in nutrient fortification of food, limited ability of current dietary assessment tools to distinguish among fortified and unfortified foods and the lag in updating nutrient databases with current nutrient information.</p><p style=text-indent:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0><font style=letter-spacing:0> </font></p><p style=text-indent:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center><font style=font-family:Arial;font-size:16pt;letter-spacing:-.4pt><b>Limitations of our Methodological Approach</b></font></p><p style=margin-right:.05in;margin-top:9pt><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>The number of potentially relevant (English language articles on humans and not reviews) </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>vitamin D studies indexed in MEDLINE is very large (~15,000) and the number of calcium </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>studies is even larger (~110,000). Without unlimited time and resources, the systematic review </font><font style=letter-spacing:0>conducted in this report had to focus on selected key questions predefined by our federal </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt>sponsors with input from the IOM, and capitalize on existing systematic reviews. Using previous </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>systematic reviews risks propagating deficiencies and errors</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt><sup><font style=font-size:9.6pt>242</font></sup></font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt> introduced in those reviews (e.g., </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>errors in data abstraction, flawed assumptions in quantitative synthesis). Although we have </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>assessed the quality of these systematic reviews using AMSTAR</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt><sup><font style=font-size:9.6pt>26</font></sup></font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt> checklist, we cannot reliably </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>know the validity of the reported summary data without knowing the details of the primary </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>studies. It should also be stressed that a well-performed systematic review does not necessarily </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>imply that the body of evidence for a particular outcome of interest is of high quality. While </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>some systematic reviews assessed the quality of the individual studies, the methods used varied. </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>Any systematic review is limited by the quality of the primary studies included in the review. </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>Unless the methods used to assess the quality of the primary studies is transparent and the details </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>made available for examination, it would be difficult to reliably determine the validity of the conclusions. Also, relying on existing systematic reviews alone could have potentially precluded </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>us from identifying all relevant studies because those systematic reviews might have addressed </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>somewhat different questions and had a different scope from this review. For example, for </font>growth outcome in children, we principally relied on the findings from a meta-analysis of RCTs <font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>of calcium originally designed to evaluate bone density outcomes. If there were RCTs of calcium </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>intake specifically designed to measure growth outcomes such as weight and height gain, but not bone density, then those studies would not have been identified. In addition, as per the task order from AHRQ, we relied on the Ottawa report for bone health outcomes and we did not examine </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>specific studies included in that report. As a consequence, if those studies had reported other </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>(than bone health) outcomes that were of interest, those studies would not have been included in </font>this review.</p><p style=margin-right:.15in;margin-top:3.6pt>As there is no consensus on how to assess the quality of the nutrition observational studies, <font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>we created a quality checklist based on a newly published reporting standard for observational </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>studies</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt><sup><font style=font-size:9.6pt>32</font></sup></font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt> and nutrition reporting items that we believe should be considered in quality </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>assessment. This checklist, however, has not been calibrated and the intra- and interrater </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>variability have not been assessed. We should also remind the readers that impeccable study reporting does not equate study validity. However, transparent, comprehensive, and accurate </font>reporting does help in evaluating a study’s validity.</p><p style=margin-right:.05in><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>Also, studies on vitamin D and calcium were not specifically targeted at life stages (except </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.5pt>for children, pregnant, and postmenopausal women) specified for the determination of DRI. We, </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>therefore, were unable to structure our report strictly according to prespecified life stages. When </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>a study enrolled populations that spanned across multiple life stages, we provided our best </font>estimates as to which life stage(s) the study’s findings would be of most relevance.</p><p style=text-indent:0;margin-left:0;text-align:center;margin-top:14.4pt><font style=font-family:Arial;font-size:16pt;letter-spacing:-.4pt><b>Comments on the Observational Studies</b></font></p><p style=margin-right:.15in;margin-top:10.8pt><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>All the included observational studies were designed to generate hypotheses of potential </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>associations of multiple factors with vitamin D or calcium. Therefore, a finding of a significant </font>association in these studies, after exploratory analyses, should not be considered equivalent to <font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>the result of studies that were designed to confirm this relationship. Many of the nested case-</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>control studies typically excluded a substantial portion of participants (some as high as 60 to 70 </font>percent) in the original cohorts because blood samples, or completed dietary questionnaires were <font style=letter-spacing:0>not available. How this selection bias would affect the reported association is unclear. In </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>addition, several of the studies might have suffered from outcome misclassification; for example, </font>when cancer cases were identified from registries without histopathology verification. The effect <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>of outcome misclassification is unpredictable. Furthermore, many of the studies did not report a </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>power calculation. Even though many of the studies included cohorts with relatively large </font>numbers of subjects (tens of thousands), it is plausible that, in fact, the included studies may <font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>have been underpowered to detect the true effect sizes. If that were the case, the significant effect </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>reported may, in fact, be spurious. Furthermore, many of the reported effect sizes were small to </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>moderate (with OR ranged from 1.03 to 2.0).

Many studies showed substantial heterogeneity. </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>Some studies adjusted the serum 25(OH)D concentration by season of serum collection, some </font><font style=letter-spacing:0>did not. While the majority of the studies used some forms of RIA to measure the serum 25(OH)D concentration, a minority used competitive protein-binding assay. Some studies </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>reported a substantial proportion of the frozen serums were accidentally thawed and limited the </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>analyses that could be performed. It is unclear how this would alter the overall results. Many </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>studies suffered from potentially inadequate outcome ascertainment (e.g., reliance on self-</font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>reported calcium intake and hypertension diagnosis). Time between measurement of serum </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>25(OH)D concentration and the diagnosis of interest varied. For prostate and colorectal cancer, it ranged from 1 to more than 16 years. Factors potentially relevant to the outcomes of interest like </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>family history (in colorectal cancer) were not consistently reported and accounted for in the </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>studies. Also, the blinding of case assessors to the risk factor of interest (e.g., serum 25(OH)D </font>concentrations) as well as that of investigators who measured the risk factor <i>per se</i> to outcomes were rarely reported.</p><p style=margin-right:.5in;margin-top:1.8pt>For studies on calcium supplementation, intake compliance, information on the <font style=letter-spacing:-.4pt>bioavailability of the calcium source, the role of background sun exposure, and associated </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>vitamin D effects were not consistently available across all studies.

Though, we did not find any reason to consider these trials to be biased, they </font>are nonetheless an arbitrary sample of all studies that have reported the association between <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>vitamin D intake dose and change in serum 25(OH)D concentration. We did not perform a </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>quantitative synthesis (e.g., meta-regression) to examine the relationship between vitamin D </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>intake dose and serum 25(OH)D concentration due to the heterogeneity across studies. Studies </font>had varied compliance rates in the vitamin D intake; limited or no adjustment for skin pigmentations, calcium intake, or background sun exposure; different vitamin D assay <font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>methodologies and measurement (both intra- and interassay) variability.

Ideally, this should <font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>be an iterative process involving the sponsors, EPC, TEP and targeted end-users. The questions </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>should be reviewed and potentially refined once the “state” of the literature has been </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>systematically appraised, with the understanding that any modifications to the key questions after </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.3pt>the review process has started will likely extend the literature review and synthesis processes. In </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>addition, developing relevant study selection criteria for the systematic review is critical to </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.1pt>finding pertinent data to answer the key questions; the TEP should be engaged early in this </font><font style=letter-spacing:-.2pt>process.
