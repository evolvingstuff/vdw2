 **How Quercetin Inhibits Viral Infection** 

* Inhibiting the virus' ability to infect cells

* Inhibiting replication of already infected cells

* Reducing infected cells' resistance to treatment with antiviral medication

* "A 1985 study, which found quercetin inhibits infectivity and replication of herpes simplex virus type 1, polio-virus type 1, parainfluenza virus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus."

* "Another 2016 study found quercetin offered protection against influenza A virus H1N1 by modulating protein expression. More specifically, the regulation of heat shock proteins, fibronectin 1 and prohibitin was instrumental in reducing viral replication."

* "Most recently, a March 2020 stud y24 in the Microbial Pathogenesis journal found quercetin "provides comprehensive protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection," both in vitro and in vivo, primarily by neutralizing pneumolysin (PLY),25"

* In the featured[ **MedCram video** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=U7F1cnWup9M&feature=emb_logo), pulmonologist  **Dr. Roger Seheult**  discusses the importance of vitamin D for the prevention of COVID-19. While there are no clinical trials investigating vitamin D for coronavirus specifically, there are plenty of data showing it's an important component in the prevention and treatment of influenza26 and upper respiratory tract infections.27

* As noted by Seheult, while vitamin D does not appear to have a direct effect on the virus itself, it strengthens immune function, thus allowing the host body to combat the virus more effectively.28 It also suppresses inflammatory processes. Taken together, this might make vitamin D quite useful against COVID-19.

* As explained by Seheult, robust immune function is required for your body to combat the virus, but an overactivated immune system is also responsible for the cytokine storm we see in COVID-19 infection that can lead to death.

   * "What we want is a smart immune system," Seheult says, "An immune system that takes care of the virus but doesn't put us into an inflammatory condition that could put us on a ventilator."
