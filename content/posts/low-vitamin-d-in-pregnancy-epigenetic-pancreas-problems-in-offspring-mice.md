The maternal deficiency of vitamin D can act on organogenesis in mice offspring, being a risk factor for chronic diseases in adulthood. This study investigates the effects of maternal deficiency of vitamin D on structural islet remodeling and insulin-signaling pathway in the offspring. We studied male C57Bl/6 offspring at 3-month old (n = 10/group) from mother fed one of the two diets: control diet (C) or vitamin D-restricted diet (VitD-). After weaning, offspring only fed the control diet ad libitum. In the offspring, we studied insulin production, islet remodeling, and islet protein expression of the insulin-signaling pathway (Western blotting, isolated islet, n = 5/group). 

VitD- offspring showed 

* greater glycemia (P = 0.012), 

* smaller beta-cell mass (P = 0.014), and 

* hypoinsulinemia (P = 0.024) than C offspring. 

Comparing VitD- offspring with C offspring, we observed 

* lower protein levels in islet of insulin (P = 0.003), 

* insulin receptor substrate-1 (P = 0.025), 

* phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (P = 0.045), 

* 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (P = 0.017), 

* protein kinase B (P = 0.028), with 

* reduced expression of pancreas/duodenum homeobox-1 (PDX-1) (P = 0.016), 

* glucose transporter-2 (P = 0.003), and

* glucokinase (P = 0.045). 

The maternal vitamin D-restricted diet modifies the development of the pancreas of the offspring, leading to islet remodeling and altered insulin-signaling pathway. 

The decrease of PDX-1 is probably significant to the changes in the beta-cell mass and insulin secretion in adulthood.
