BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D deficiency is a widely recognized public health problem. Efficacy of a recently developed micellized form of vitamin D3 has not been studied. Hence, we undertook this study to compare its efficacy with the conventionally used fat-soluble vitamin D3.

METHODS:

In this open-labeled nonrandomized pilot study, we recruited 180 healthy children,  **aged 13** -14 years in two groups and supplemented Group A (60 children) with 60,000 IU of fat-soluble vitamin D3/month with milk and Group B (120 children) with 60,000 IU/month of water miscible vitamin D3 under supervision for 6 months. Serum 25(OD)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were evaluated before and after supplementation in 156 children (54 in Group A and 102 in Group B ) who completed the study.

RESULTS:

We observed a significantly greater increase in the serum 25(OH)D levels in group B as compared to group A (31.8±9.1 ng/mL vs. 23.7±10.4 ng/mL; p<0.001). All children in group B achieved adequate levels of serum 25(OH)D (>20 ng/mL) as against 83.3% children in group A. Serum PTH and ALP levels declined considerably in both the groups following supplementation.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D supplementation significantly increased the serum 25(OH)D levels in both groups. Miscible form of vitamin D3 appears to be better in achieving higher levels of serum 25(OH)D than that observed with a similar dose of fat-soluble vitamin D3. Further studies with different dose regimens are required to establish its efficacy over the conventionally used fat-soluble vitamin D3.

 **A randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of micellised and fat-soluble vitamin D3 supplementation in healthy adults**

Nanoemulsion formulation of vitamin D3 have been shown to have better bioavailability than the coarse emulsion preparation in vitro and in vivo animal studies. In the absence of randomised trial in humans, comparing the efficacy of nanotechnology-based miscellised vitamin D3 over conventional vitamin D3, we undertook this study. A total of 180 healthy adults were randomised to receive either micellised (DePura, group A) or conventional vitamin D3 (Calcirol, group B ) at a monthly dose of 60 000 IU (1500μg) for 6 months. The outcome parameters were serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and urinary Ca:creatinine ratio. A total of eighty-nine subjects in group A and seventy-seven in group B completed the trial. 

Subjects in both the groups had a significant increase in their serum 25(OH)D levels following supplementation 

* (group A: 21·5 (sd 10·9) to 76·7 (sd 18·8) nmol/l (P<0·001); 

* group B: 22·8 (sd 10·4) to 57·8 (sd 16·0) nmol/l (P<0·001)). 

Participants in micellised group had an additional increase of 20·2 (95 % CI 14·0, 26·4) nmol/l in serum 25(OH)D levels (P<0·001). The difference between the groups was 17·5 (95 % CI 11·8, 23·1) nmol/l, which remained statistically significant (P<0·001) even after adjustment for age and sex. Significant decline in mean serum PTH was observed in both the groups. No hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria was noted. Although supplementation with both the preparations resulted in a significant rise in serum 25(OH)D levels, micellised vitamin D3 appeared to be more efficacious in achieving higher levels of serum 25(OH)D.
