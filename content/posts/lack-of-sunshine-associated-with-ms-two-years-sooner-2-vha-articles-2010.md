Background: Current evidence suggests that sun exposure and vitamin D intake, during childhood and adolescence, are associated with a reduced risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the role of these environmental agents in the timing of disease symptom onset remains to be investigated. 

Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we recruited participants from the Veterans Health Administration – Multiple Sclerosis Surveillance Registry. Self-reported histories of residential locations, sun exposure and intake of vitamin D were used to estimate vitamin-D-related exposures. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations between these variables and age at MS onset. 

Results: Among veterans with relapsing MS who resided in low-to-medium solar radiation areas (n = 540), low sun exposure in the fall/winter during the ages of  **6–15 years**  was significantly associated with  **earlier symptom onset by 2.1 years**  (p = 0.02).  **Intake of cod liver oil during the same age period was associated with later onset of MS symptoms by 4 years**  (p = 0.02). 

Conclusions: The current study provides evidence for an association between vitamin-D-related exposures during childhood and early adolescence and the timing of MS symptom onset, and supports vitamin D as a potential modulator of the clinical course of this disease.

### This study, along with the dissertation by the same author which proceeded it, [are the primary documents being used by the VHA to examine MS treatment options](http://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/research/abstracts.cfm?Project_ID=2141697786). Heavy emphasis on vitamin D to treat MS.

Backgrounds/Aim

Gestational and early life events have been suggested to contribute to multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. We assessed the effects of time and place of birth on the age at onset of MS symptoms.

Methods

We selected a national cohort of 967 veterans from the Multiple Sclerosis Surveillance Registry for whom month and season (time) of birth, and birthplace (city and state) were available. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between time of birth, birthplace latitude and solar radiation, and the age at onset of MS symptoms among the study sample.

Results

Patients with a relapsing form of the disease (R-MS), who were born in winter and whose birthplace was in low solar radiation areas, had disease symptom onset on average 2.8 years earlier than those born in seasons other than winter and in medium- and high-solar radiation areas (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

These results suggest that exposure early in life to geographical and seasonal factors, possibly related to the protective effect of sunlight, and thus vitamin D, is associated with a delay in MS symptom onset. Other larger studies are required to examine the period-specific (from conception to adulthood) environmental factors that are associated with MS susceptibility.
