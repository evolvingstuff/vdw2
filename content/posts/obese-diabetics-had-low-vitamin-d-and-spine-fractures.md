## Spinal deformity index in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Endocrine. 2013 Jun;43(3):651-8. [doi: 10.1007/s12020-012-9848-z.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-012-9848-z.) Epub 2012 Dec 11.

The objective of this study is to investigate bone metabolism, density, and quality in patients with diabetes type 2 using DEXA and  **spinal deformity index (SDI)** , a surrogate index of bone quality.  **Fifty-six patients**  with type 2 diabetes were studied; exclusion criteria were diseases and medications that affect bone and mineral metabolism. 

* Mean age was 65 ± 7 years. 

* Mean diabetes duration was 10 ± 7 years and 

* mean HbA1C was 6.6 ± 0.5 %. 

* BMI was 30 ± 4.  (VitaminDWiki comment = Obese)

Fifty-six sex, age, and BMI matched served as controls. All subjects underwent a clinical and biochemical examination. Spinal and femoral neck BMD were measured by DEXA, and a spine radiography was performed to assess vertebral fractures and to calculate SDI. 

Mean serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were 

* 19.6 ± 3.7 ng/ml in patients and 

* 30 ± 14 ng/ml in controls (p < 0.01). 

PTH serum levels were 47.9 ± 40 pg/ml in patients versus 37 ± 5.3 pg/ml in controls (p < 0.01). At lumbar spine there was a significant difference between patients and controls only for T-score (p = <0.01), while at femoral neck there was a difference in BMD (p < 0.01) and in T-score (p < 0.01). 

 **Radiological vertebral fractures**  were found in 

* 46 % of patients and 

* 17 % of controls (p < 0.05). 

SDI was higher in patients than in controls (p < 0.05). 

The percentage of fractures with T-score BMD greater than -2.5 was 69 % in patients and 10 % in controls (p < 0.05). 

As a conclusion, BMD was similar in patients and in controls, while SDI value was higher in patients; therefore, SDI was more specific than BMD for the diagnosis of osteoporosis due to metabolic diseases.
