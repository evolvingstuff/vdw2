Objectives: The effect and safety of Nasafytol®, a food supplement combining curcumin, quercetin, and Vitamin D, on hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients as support to standard of care were to be assessed.

Methods: This exploratory, open-label, randomized, controlled trial was carried out among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection. Participants were randomly assigned to receive Nasafytol® or Fultium® control. The improvement of the clinical condition and occurrence of (serious) adverse events were evaluated. The study was registered on clincaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT04844658.

Results: Twenty-five patients received Nasafytol®, and 24 received Fultium®. Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the groups. On day 14 (or at hospital leave if <14days), no difference was observed between groups regarding their clinical condition, fever, or the need of oxygen therapy. 

At day 7, however, 

* 19 participants had been discharged from the hospital in the Nasafytol® arm compared to 

* 10 participants in the Fultium® arm. 

* No participants were transferred to the ICU or died in the Nasafytol® arm, vs. 

* 4 transfers and 1 death in the Fultium® arm. 

The clinical condition of participants in the Nasafytol® arm had improved, as evidenced by a decrease in the COVID-19 WHO score. Interestingly, five SAEs occurred with Fultium®, while no SAE was observed with Nasafytol®.

Conclusion: Supplementation with Nasafytol®, in addition to standard-of-care treatment, led to a faster discharge from the hospital, improved clinical conditions of participants, and a reduced risk of serious outcomes, including transfer to the intensive care unit or death, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
