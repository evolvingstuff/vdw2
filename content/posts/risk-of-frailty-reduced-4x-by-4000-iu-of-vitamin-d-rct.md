 **Risks if initially had 20-29 ng level of vitamin D**

Background

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level is associated with a greater risk of frailty, but the effects of daily vitamin D supplementation on frailty are uncertain. This secondary analysis aimed to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on frailty using data from the Study To Understand Fall Reduction and Vitamin D in You (STURDY).

Methods

The STURDY trial, a two-stage Bayesian, response-adaptive, randomized controlled trial, enrolled 688 community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 70 years with a low serum 25(OH)D level (10–29 ng/mL) and elevated fall risk. Participants were initially randomized to 200 IU/d (control dose; n = 339) or a higher dose (1000 IU/d, 2000 IU/d, or 4000 IU/d; n = 349) of vitamin D3. Once the 1000 IU/d was selected as the best higher dose, other higher dose groups were reassigned to the 1000 IU/d group and new enrollees were randomized 1:1 to 1000 IU/d or control group. Data were collected at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months. Frailty phenotype was based on number of the following conditions: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, slowness, low activity, and weakness (≥ 3 conditions as frail, 1 or 2 as pre-frail, and 0 as robust). Cox proportional hazard models estimated the risk of developing frailty, or improving or worsening frailty status at follow-up. All models were adjusted for demographics, health conditions, and further stratified by baseline serum 25(OH)D level (insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL) vs. deficiency (10–19 ng/mL)).

Results

Among 687 participants (mean age 77.1 ± 5.4, 44% women) with frailty assessment at baseline, 208 (30%) were robust, 402 (59%) were pre-frail, and 77 (11%) were frail. Overall, there was no significant difference in risk of frailty outcomes comparing the pooled higher doses (PHD; ≥ 1000 IU/d) vs. 200 IU/d. When comparing each higher dose vs. 200 IU/d, the 2000 IU/d group had nearly double the risk of worsening frailty status (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13–3.16),  **while the 4000 IU/d group had a lower risk of developing frailty (HR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05–0.97).**  There were no significant associations between vitamin D doses and frailty status in the analyses stratified by baseline serum 25(OH)D level.

Conclusions

High dose vitamin D supplementation did not prevent frailty. Significant subgroup findings might be the results of type 1 error.

#### There Is No Magic Pill to Prevent Frailty—You Still Have to Eat Your Vegetables (nope) - Sept 2022

 **[JAMA Open Network](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2796092)** 

"The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce incident frailty, with a pooled odds ratio of  **0.44**  for individuals who are most adherent to the diet."

* which is half as good as the odds ratio of 0.22 for the Vitamin D study on this page

* They state that Vitamin D does not work based on a study that used only 2,000 IU of vitamin D
