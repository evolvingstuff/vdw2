#### Fig. 2. Comparison of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), and calculated bioavailable 25(OH)D by gestational stage.

* (A)  **Total 25(OH)D levels**  were not significantly different between the 1st and 2nd and 3rd trimesters (median, interquartile range: 1st trimester: 18.20, 15.07-23.87 ng/mL; 2nd and 3rd trimesters: 18.30, 13.75-25.70 ng/mL). 

* (B)  **VDBP levels**  during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters were significantly higher than those during the 1st trimester (1st trimester: 102.20, 84.75-259.90 µg/mL, 2nd and 3rd trimesters: 273.65, 163.75-453.98 µg/mL). 

* (C) The  **calculated bioavailable**  25(OH)D level in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters was significantly lower than that in the 1st trimester (1st trimester: 4.19, 2.09-5.67 ng/mL; 2nd and 3rd trimesters, 1.73, 0.90-2.43 ng/mL). 

* P values were calculated by the Mann-Whitney test. 

* Two dashed lines denote vitamin D deficiency and severe vitamin D deficiency. 

* The arrowheads and dots represent the outside value (>1.5× interquartile ranges) and far-out value (>3× interquartile ranges), respectively. 

* The horizontal lines represent the maximum and minimum values, except for the outside value and far-out value.

#### Fig. 1. Comparison of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), and calculated bioavailable 25(OH)D in the three study groups.

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/compare.jpg" alt="image" width="1000">

* (A) The  **total 25(OH)D level**  in intensive care unit (ICU) patients (median, interquartile range: 11.65, 7.86-14.87 ng/mL) was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (18.25, 13.48-23.78 ng/mL) or in pregnant women (18.25, 13.98-25.24 ng/mL).

* (B) The  **VDBP level**  in 

> pregnant women (225.01, 130.24-422.92 μg/mL) was significantly higher, and the 

> VDBP level in ICU patients (95.58, 61.15-167.34 μg/mL) was significantly lower 

> than that in healthy controls (167.18, 105.99-257.70 μg/mL). (

* C) The  **calculated bioavailable**  25(OH)D levels of 

> ICU patients (1.97, 1.48-3.15 ng/mL) and 

> pregnant women (1.93, 1.03-3.41 ng/mL) were significantly lower than those in 

> healthy controls (2.56, 1.95-4.22 ng/mL). 

* P values were calculated by the Mann-Whitney test. 

* Two dashed lines denote vitamin D deficiency and severe vitamin D deficiency. 

* The arrowheads and dots represent the outside value (>1.5? interquartile ranges) and far-out value (>3? interquartile ranges), respectively. 

* The horizontal lines represent maximum and minimum values, except for the outside value and far-out value.
