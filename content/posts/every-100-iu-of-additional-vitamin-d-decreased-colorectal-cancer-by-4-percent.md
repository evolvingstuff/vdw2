BACKGROUND: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on colorectal cancer and vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, as part of the World Cancer Research Fund Continuous Update Project. We also aimed at conducting meta-analysis of all studies on colorectal cancer and vitamin D receptor (VDR) single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

METHODS: Relevant studies were identified in PubMed (up until June 2010). Inclusion criteria were original, peer-reviewed publications, with a prospective design (for studies on vitamin D intake or status). Random effects dose-response meta-analyses were performed on cancer incidence.

RESULTS: We observed inverse associations of colorectal cancer risk with dietary vitamin D (summary RR per 100 IU/day=0.95 95%CI: (0.93-0.98); 10 studies; range of intake (midpoints) = 39-719 IU/day) and serum/plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (RR per 100 IU/l=0.96 (0.94-0.97); 

6 studies; range=200-1800 IU/l), but not with total vitamin D (5 studies). Supplemental (2 studies; range=0-600 IU/day) and total (4 studies; range=79-732 IU/day) vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (6 studies; range=200-1800 IU/l) were inversely associated with colon cancer risk. We did not observe statistically significant associations between FokI, PolyA, TaqI, Cdx2 and ApaI VDR polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk. The BsmI polymorphism was associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk (RR=0.57 (0.36-0.89) for BB vs. bb, 8 studies).

CONCLUSIONS: These meta-analyses support the evidence of an inverse association between vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D status and the BsmI VDR polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk.Impact: Improving vitamin D status could be potentially beneficial against colorectal cancer incidence.

“Six studies showed each additional 100 IU of serum vitamin D per liter within the range of 200 to 1800 IU/L was associated with 4 percent reduced risk of colorectal cancer.”
