### <span style="color:#00F;">Summary (based on data below and many other Vitamin D studies)</span>

 **Known:**   &nbsp; &nbsp; Low vitamin D while pregnant or as a child or due to poor Vitamin D genes is associated with Food Allergies

 **Suspected:**   &nbsp; &nbsp; One or more environmental stressors (such as Roundup) cause the food allergy if low level of vitamin D

 **Anticipated:** &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing Vitamin D levels  while pregnant or as a child will PREVENT Food Allergies

 **Possible:**  &nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing Vitamin D levels will TREAT a food allergic child

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; may also need one or more items which increase activation of Vitamin D genes
