&lt;p>Hypovitaminosis D is a very common disorder, regarding both Western and developing countries. A growing amount of data over the last years have shown vitamin D deficiency to be high prevalent among HIV-positive subjects. In addition to &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; risk factors, such as female sex, low dietary intake, dark skin pigmentation and low sun exposure, HlV-related factors, including immune activation and anti-retroviral adverse effects, may affect vitamin D status. Even if both protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been associated with low vitamin D levels, available evidences have failed to univocally associate hypovitaminosis D with specific antiretroviral class effects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HIV inflammation markers associated with vitamin D less than 10 ng</title><link>/posts/hiv-inflammation-markers-associated-with-vitamin-d-less-than-10-ng.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hiv-inflammation-markers-associated-with-vitamin-d-less-than-10-ng.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>HIV associated with low vitamin D and high C-reactive protein</title><link>/posts/hiv-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-and-high-c-reactive-protein.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hiv-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-and-high-c-reactive-protein.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-levels-and-c-reactive-protein-in-persons-with-human-immunodeficiency-virus-infection">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and C-reactive protein in persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has been frequently associated with vitamin D deficiency as well as chronic inflammatory response. We tested the hypothesis of an independent relationship between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) in a cohort of HIV-positive people. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 316 HIV-positive people (181 men and 135 women) aged 16 to 60 years residing in the Kathmandu Valley, &lt;strong>Nepal&lt;/strong> . Serum high-sensitivity CRP concentrations and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured by the latex agglutination nephelometry method and the competitive protein-binding assay, respectively. The relationship between serum CRP concentrations and 25(OH)D serum level were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment of potential cardiovascular and HIV-related factors. The proportion of participants with 25(OH)D serum level of &amp;lt;20ng/mL, 20-30ng/mL, and &amp;gt;30ng/mL were 83.2%, 15.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. The mean 25(OH)D serum level in men and women were 15.3ng/mL and 14.4ng/mL, respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HIV patients having EFC therapy were 3X more likely to have low vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/hiv-patients-having-efc-therapy-were-3x-more-likely-to-have-low-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hiv-patients-having-efc-therapy-were-3x-more-likely-to-have-low-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-deficiency-among-hiv-1-infected-patients-in-a-tropical-setting">Vitamin D Insufficiency and Deficiency among HIV-1-Infected Patients in a Tropical Setting&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Given the aging of the American population with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the high prevalence of suboptimal 25(OH)D (vitamin D) levels, osteoporosis is likely to be a growing concern among clinicians caring for this population. HIV infection has been shown to be a strong predictor for an abnormal dual X-ray absorptionmetry testing and is potentially a risk for fractures at older ages. This paper reviews management issues for osteoporosis specific to the population with HIV, including both prevention and treatment strategies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blacks with HIV were 3.5X more likely to be vitamin D deficient than whites</title><link>/posts/blacks-with-hiv-were-35x-more-likely-to-be-vitamin-d-deficient-than-whites.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blacks-with-hiv-were-35x-more-likely-to-be-vitamin-d-deficient-than-whites.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="risk-factors-for-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-hiv-infected-patients-in-the-south-central-united-states">Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected patients in the south central United States.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>We evaluated the prevalence of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> deficiency and the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected patients in the South-Central United States. The study consisted of a cross-sectional assessment of vitamin D levels in HIV-infected patients receiving routine clinical care from a private practice in Houston, Texas (latitude 29°N). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 20?ng/ml (&amp;lt;50?nmol/liter). Two-hundred enrolled patients were surveyed with a vitamin D questionnaire to determine daily supplemental vitamin D intake, dietary vitamin D intake, and average sunlight exposure (minutes/day). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Median 25(OH)D was 15.5?ng/ml (interquartile range 10.9-24.6) for the total population (n=200).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected and un-infected women in the US</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-hiv-infected-and-un-infected-women-in-the-us.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-hiv-infected-and-un-infected-women-in-the-us.html</guid><description>&lt;p>J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2011 Apr 5.&lt;/p>
