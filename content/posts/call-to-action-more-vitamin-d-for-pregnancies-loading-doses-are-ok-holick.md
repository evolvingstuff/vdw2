 **Highlights** 

* 25X increase in getting >20 ng when test and give vitamin D if <20 ng

* 600 IU dose (IoM) is NOT a large enough if goal is > 20 ng

* Supplementation reduced preterm delivery by 67%

* Must exceed 20 ng

   * but 40 ng may be a better goal

* Decrease by 55%: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm delivery

* Placenta, like kidney, can activate Vitamin D

* Do not appear to need to have different dose sizes for those < 10 ng and those < 20 ng

* 50,000 IU weekly for up to 12 weeks is OK

 **He does not mention the importance of:** 

Getting vitamin D levels high as soon as possible - before conception is best

Omega-3 has many benefits during pregnancy

Taking the Vitamin D weekly or biweekly may be better than daily
