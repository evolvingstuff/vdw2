#### The effect of vitamin D on neurocognitive functions in older vitamin D deficient adults: a pilot longitudinal interventional study

Psychogeriatrics. 2023 Sep;23(5):781-788. [doi: 10.1111/psyg.12997](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12997)

Background: The relationship between vitamin D and cognitive status remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D replacement on cognitive functions in healthy and cognitively intact vitamin D deficient older females.

Methods: This study was designed as a prospective interventional study. A total of 30 female adults aged ≥60 with a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level of <10 ng/ml were included. Participants were administered  **50 000 IU vitamin D3 weekly for 8 weeks**  followed by a maintenance therapy of 1000 U/day. Detailed neuropsychological assessment was performed prior to vitamin D replacement and repeated at 6 months by the same psychologist.

Results: Mean age was 63 ± 6.7 years and baseline  **vitamin D level was 7.8**  ± 2.0 (range: 3.5-10.3) ng/ml. At 6 months, vitamin D level was  **32.5**  ± 3.4 (32.2-55) ng/ml. 

* The Judgement of Line Orientation Test (P = 0.04),

* inaccurate word memorizing of the Verbal Memory Processes Test (P = 0.02), 

* perseveration scores of the Verbal Memory Processes Test (P = 0.005),

*  topographical accuracy of the Warrington Recognition Memory Test (P = 0.002), and the 

* spontaneous self-correction of an error in the Boston Naming Test (P = 0.003) 

scores increased significantly, while the 

* delayed recall score in the Verbal Memory Processes Test (P = 0.03), 

* incorrect naming of words in the Boston Naming Test (P = 0.04), 

* interference time of the Stroop Test (P = 0.05), and 

* spontaneous corrections of the Stroop Test (P = 0.02) 

scores decreased significantly from baseline.

Conclusion: Vitamin D replacement has a positive effect on cognitive domains related to visuospatial, executive, and memory processing functions.

#### Comment on inadequate follow-up dosing by VitaminDWiki:

 **Only 1,000 IU of vitamin D was given daily during the last 4 months%%%If they had instead used 50,000 IU every two weeks they would have had much better outcomes%%%And vitamin D levels of 40 ng instead of 30 ng**

Background: The relationship between vitamin D and cognitive status remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D replacement on cognitive functions in healthy and cognitively intact vitamin D deficient older females.

Methods: This study was designed as a prospective interventional study. A total of 30 female adults aged ≥60 with a serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level of &lt;10 ng/ml were included. Participants were administered __50 000 IU vitamin D3 weekly for 8 weeks__ followed by a maintenance therapy of 1000 U/day. Detailed neuropsychological assessment was performed prior to vitamin D replacement and repeated at 6 months by the same psychologist.

Results: Mean age was 63 ± 6.7 years and baseline __vitamin D level was 7.8__ ± 2.0 (range: 3.5-10.3) ng/ml. At 6 months, vitamin D level was __32.5__ ± 3.4 (32.2-55) ng/ml. 
*The Judgement of Line Orientation Test (P = 0.04),
*inaccurate word memorizing of the Verbal Memory Processes Test (P = 0.02), 
*perseveration scores of the Verbal Memory Processes Test (P = 0.005),
* topographical accuracy of the Warrington Recognition Memory Test (P = 0.002), and the 
*spontaneous self-correction of an error in the Boston Naming Test (P = 0.003) 
scores increased significantly, while the 
*delayed recall score in the Verbal Memory Processes Test (P = 0.03), 
*incorrect naming of words in the Boston Naming Test (P = 0.04), 
*interference time of the Stroop Test (P = 0.05), and 
*spontaneous corrections of the Stroop Test (P = 0.02) 
scores decreased significantly from baseline.

Conclusion: Vitamin D replacement has a positive effect on cognitive domains related to visuospatial, executive, and memory processing functions.

!!!!Comment on inadequate follow-up dosing by VitaminDWiki: 
__Only 1,000 IU of vitamin D was given daily during the last 4 months%%%If they had instead used 50,000 IU every two weeks they would have had much better outcomes%%%And vitamin D levels of 40 ng instead of 30 ng__
