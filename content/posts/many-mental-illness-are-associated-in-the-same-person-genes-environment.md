#### Why Do So Many Mental Illnesses Overlap?

 **[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-so-many-mental-illnesses-overlap/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=pocket_hits&utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-SPONSORED&THEPENNYHOARDER-2024_03_05=&sponsored=0&position=3&category=fascinating_stories&scheduled_corpus_item_id=047119ee-9e82-4970-bd07-9fbb9d04a7c0&url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-so-many-mental-illnesses-overlap/%20)** 

“If one person, say, has a diagnosis of schizophrenia in their family, not only are other people in the extended family more likely to have diagnosis of schizophrenia but they are also more likely to have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, autism or major depression,”

* “Individuals with mental disorders [often have symptoms of many different conditions](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/roots-of-mental-illness/), either simultaneously or at different times in their lives. What’s more, as the family patterns suggest, the genes linked with these conditions overlap.”

*  **Changing mental health problems over a lifetime**  found that people who are diagnosed with a mental health disorder often see that diagnosis changed some years later. A substance use disorder may remit and give way to depression, for example, only to later return as depression is replaced by severe anxiety, “

* “The first such studies of psychiatric disorders, published about 15 years ago, showed that many of the specific versions of genes associated with  **bipolar disorder**  were the same as those associated with __schizophrenia_. “These things that we think are distinct, most notably bipolar and schizophrenia, are not at all distinct,”

* “Since then researchers have followed suit for almost all the other major psychiatric disorders—including ADHD, PTSD, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—and found a number of genes common to all of them.”

* Study of 1.5 million Danes found ”depression, anorexia, autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia . . .”genetic variants that were common to these conditions that had roles in fetal neurodevelopment”
