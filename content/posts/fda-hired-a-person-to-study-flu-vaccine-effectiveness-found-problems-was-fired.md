Dr. John Anthony Morris was recruited by FDA’s Division of Biologics to be Chief Vaccine Control Officer to conduct research about influenza.High level officials argued for mass vaccination against the flu and common cold: Dr. Morris was charged with validating their view. 

However, after conducting extensive tests on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, Dr. Morris was alarmed at what he found.His studies raised concerns about the vaccine’s side effects. 

Dr. Morris’ research found that: 

* in children, the vaccine often induced fever; 

* in pregnant women it could harm the fetus. 

Furthermore, because the vaccine was “literally loaded with extraneous bacteria” the flu vaccine put everyone at risk of harm. 

Dr. Morris reported his concerns to DBS officials who retaliated in no uncertain terms: 

* his research materials were confiscated, 

* locks on his laboratory were changed, 

* his laboratory staff were reassigned elsewhere, and 

* his efforts to publish his findings were blocked. 

DBS further harassed Dr. Morris, assigning him to a small room with no telephone: anyone who wished to see him had to get permission from the chief of the laboratory. 

The last straw in the tug of war between Dr. Morris and the public health bureaucracy occurred in 1976 when Dr. Morris publicly challenged CDC’s nationwide Swine flu vaccination campaign. 

He warned that the vaccine was dangerous and might induce hypersensitivity and most concerning, it may induce neurological side effects. 

He was fired for insubordination. 

By Oct. 1976, 33 people had died after receiving the Swine Flu vaccine, 

by Dec. there were 500 cases of Guillain-Barre. 

But public health officials publicly denied that there was any relationship between any of the deaths or serious adverse effects and the vaccine. 

Dr. Morris was forced to retire in 1980, at which time he became a consultant for people who had been harmed by vaccines. 

“There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine, thus far developed, is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza. The producers of these <span>[influenza]</span> vaccines know they are worthless, but they go on selling them anyway. . . . It’s a medical rip-off. . . I believe the public should have truthful information on the basis of which they can determine whether or not to take the vaccine.” And he adds, “I believe that, given full information, they won’t take the vaccine.” (The Washington Post, 1979) -John Anthony Morris

 **Vitamin D** 

1) Improves the vaccine effectiveness

#### Some companies that profit from influenza vaccines:

* Sanofi: The world's largest manufacturer of flu vaccines, with $3.1 billion in revenue in 2021. Sanofi led the pack with $2.47 billion in flu shot sales in 2021, up 38% compared with 2019.

* Seqirus: Earned $1.7 billion in flu shot sales in 2021, up 30%.

* Moderna: Forecast sales in the range of $8 billion to $15 billion in 2027 from its RSV and influenza vaccines and next-generation COVID-19 shot.

Dr. John Anthony Morris was recruited by FDA’s Division of Biologics to be Chief Vaccine Control Officer to conduct research about influenza.High level officials argued for mass vaccination against the flu and common cold: Dr. Morris was charged with validating their view. 
However, after conducting extensive tests on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, Dr. Morris was alarmed at what he found.His studies raised concerns about the vaccine’s side effects. 
Dr. Morris’ research found that: 
*in children, the vaccine often induced fever; 
*in pregnant women it could harm the fetus. 
Furthermore, because the vaccine was “literally loaded with extraneous bacteria” the flu vaccine put everyone at risk of harm. 
Dr. Morris reported his concerns to DBS officials who retaliated in no uncertain terms: 
*his research materials were confiscated, 
*locks on his laboratory were changed, 
*his laboratory staff were reassigned elsewhere, and 
*his efforts to publish his findings were blocked. 
DBS further harassed Dr. Morris, assigning him to a small room with no telephone: anyone who wished to see him had to get permission from the chief of the laboratory. 

The last straw in the tug of war between Dr. Morris and the public health bureaucracy occurred in 1976 when Dr. Morris publicly challenged CDC’s nationwide Swine flu vaccination campaign. 
He warned that the vaccine was dangerous and might induce hypersensitivity and most concerning, it may induce neurological side effects. 
He was fired for insubordination. 
By Oct. 1976, 33 people had died after receiving the Swine Flu vaccine, 
by Dec. there were 500 cases of Guillain-Barre. 
But public health officials publicly denied that there was any relationship between any of the deaths or serious adverse effects and the vaccine. 
Dr. Morris was forced to retire in 1980, at which time he became a consultant for people who had been harmed by vaccines. 
“There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine, thus far developed, is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza. The producers of these [influenza] vaccines know they are worthless, but they go on selling them anyway. . . . It’s a medical rip-off. . . I believe the public should have truthful information on the basis of which they can determine whether or not to take the vaccine.” And he adds, “I believe that, given full information, they won’t take the vaccine.” (The Washington Post, 1979) -John Anthony Morris
