#### Vitamin D Intake, Blood 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, and Risk of Ovarian Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies

J Womens Health (Larchmt) . 2023 Mar 16. [doi: 10.1089/jwh.2022.0432](https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2022.0432) – PDF is behind a paywall

Background: In vitro research suggests that vitamin D may protect against the risk of ovarian cancer. However, ecological and epidemiologic evidence is still debatable. 

Materials and Methods: We searched eligible studies via MEDLINE and Web of Science databases, as well as a hand search to examine the association between vitamin D intake or blood 25(OH)D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) and ovarian cancer risk in a meta-analysis. The overall relative risk (RR) was determined using a random-effect model. 

Results: For ovarian cancer incidence, 15 observational studies were included <span>[5,634 cases for vitamin D intake and 975 cases for blood 25(OH)D]</span>. For overall vitamin D intake (from food and supplements), the pooled RR of ovarian cancer risk for the highest versus lowest groups was 0.92 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 0.74-1.14). 

For blood 25(OH)D levels, however, people with high blood 25(OH)D levels had 37% lower risk of ovarian cancer than those with low levels (pooled RR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42-0.93). By study design, the inverse association was stronger in case-control studies than in prospective studies. The dose-response meta-analysis also supports the inverse association between blood 25(OH)D levels and ovarian cancer risk. When the pooled RRs were restricted to studies that adjusted for body mass index (BMI), they tended to be stronger, but the difference by adjustment for BMI was not significant. 

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that having a high blood 25(OH)D level is associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer. More well-designed prospective studies are needed to confirm the link between vitamin D status and ovarian cancer risk.
