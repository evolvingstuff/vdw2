#### A Prospective Cohort Study of Vitamin D Supplementation in AD Soldiers: Preliminary Findings.

 **Responses to constant dosing do not plateau in many people until >3 months  
Study did manage to document trends at just 3 months  
Probably would have had statistical significance (not just trends) if either:  
- Had started with a loading dose  
- Had the trial last 6 months** 

 **Average Vitamin D 23 ng ==> 35 ng  
Note that 42% of the active duty soldiers were non-white,  
Non-whites would likely have  had low levels to start   
Would have needed  more than 5,000 IUs**

PURPOSE: To explore response to vitamin D supplementation in active duty (AD) warfighters and translate findings into evidence-based health policy.

BACKGROUND: Soldiers are at risk for musculoskeletal injuries and metabolic dysfunction that impact physical performance and military readiness; the link with low vitamin D status is unclear.

METHODS:

This prospective trial enrolled 152 soldiers; baseline 25 hydroxyvitamin (OH) D level determined assignment to a no-treatment control (CG) or treatment group (TG) receiving a vitamin D3 supplement for 90 days. Symptoms, diet, sun exposure, and blood biomarkers obtained at baseline (T1) and 3 months (T2).

RESULTS:

Cohort was predominantly white (58%) with a significant difference in racial distribution for vitamin D status. Mean (SD) 25(OH)D levels were 37.8 (5.6) ng/mL, 22.2 (5.0) ng/mL, and 22.9 (4.7) ng/mL for the CG, low dose TG, and high-dose TG at T1, respectively. Following three months of treatment, one-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference between groups (F5,246 = 44.37; p < 0.0001). Vitamin D intake was 44% of Recommended Dietary Allowance throughout the first phase of the trial. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scores improved in TG for fatigue and sleep, p < 0.01.

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is widespread in AD soldiers. Clinicians must intervene early in preventable health conditions impacting warfighter performance and readiness and recommend appropriate self-care strategies.
