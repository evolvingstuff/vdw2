## Vitamin D Supplementation during Pregnancy and Its Effect on Pregnancy Outcomes

The function and requirement of vitamin D during pregnancy for both mother and fetus has remained a mystery. 

This fact was highlighted by The Cochrane Review in 1999 that reported a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with respect to vitamin D requirements during pregnancy. 

Unfortunately, during the past decade only a single RCT has been performed with respect to vitamin D requirements during pregnancy. 

In this review we will discuss vitamin D metabolism during pregnancy as well as the consequences of vitamin D deficiency on skeletal, non-skeletal and birth outcomes using birth observational data and data from our recent RCT. 

New RCT data strongly support previous observational studies in that improving nutritional vitamin D status will improve birth outcomes. 

The new RCT data indicates that 4,000 IU/d vitamin D3 during pregnancy will "normalize" vitamin D Metabolism and improve birth outcomes including primary cesarean section and co-morbidities of pregnancy with no Risk of side effects.
