**Chart from the web shows that CYP24A1 (which destroys Vitamin D)  
 is normally activated by diabetes (2),   
but is deactivated by addition of Vitamin D (3) in rats**

Association of liver calcitriol (active vitamin D metabolite) catabolism with osteomalacia during prolonged use of certain drugs was reported in several recent studies. To examine whether the increased calcitriol catabolism could be a potential link between ageing/diabetes mellitus (DM) and bone loss, we studied the dynamic of expression of CYP24, the main calcitriol catabolising enzyme in the liver of rats during ageing and a long-term experimental DM1. DM1 model was induced with intraperitoneally injected streptozotocin (STZ) (55 mg/kg). Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed 6 and 12 months after the DM1 induction. The immunohistochemical analyses of CYP24 and transforming growth factor ß 1 (TGF-ß1) expression in the liver were performed. We found that ageing and long-term DM1 resulted in a significantly increased expression of CYP24 in hepatocytes, as well as in non-hepatocyte liver cells (Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells). Ageing and long-term DM1 resulted in an increased expression of TGF-ß1 as well. Expression of CYP24 coexisted with the expression of TGF-ß1 in all types of hepatic cells. 

We concluded that liver has the capacity for an active vitamin D catabolism in different populations of liver cells, especially in sinusoidal endothelial cells, through an expression of CYP24. That capacity is substantially increased during ageing and long-term diabetes mellitus. Increased liver calcitriol catabolism could be one of the mechanisms of the bone metabolism impairment related to ageing and diabetes.
