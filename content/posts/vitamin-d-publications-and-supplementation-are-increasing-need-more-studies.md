Scragg notices that many trials have found a benefit in vitamin D intervention (supplimentation)

Scragg is concerned that meta-analyses have not also found a benefit - perhaps the studies were not large enough

Unfortunately, meta-analyses typically ignore

1. Dose size 

   * 40 IU given same consideration as 4,000 IU

1. Trial duration

   * 2 months is not long enough without a loading dose)

1. Time between doses 

   * daily being given same consideration as annual

1. One size does not fit all

   * some people need up to 10X larger dose to benefit

   * e.g. genes, obesity, smoking, shut-in, dark skin, etc.

1. Form of Vitamin D used

   * Vitamin D3 is much better than D2

   * people with gut problems often need a gut-friendly form

1. When the trial was performed

   * ~2X more vitamin D deficiency now than 20 years ago
