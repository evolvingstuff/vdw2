* They could have used a loading dose to replete the Vitamin D levels in 1 week instead of 12 weeks

* The 120,000 IU dose every 4 weeks is just a bit larger than the 50,000 IU dose every 2 weeks which VitaminDWiki recommends

* The 120,000 IU dose was the only one to achieve a reduction in PTH levels

* 30 day doses are OK, but not as effective as doses given < 19 days.

Abstract

Background

A critical need exists to better understand the physiological sequel of vitamin D supplementation in obese individuals and African Americans. The aim was to comprehensively evaluate dose- and time-responses of a panel of vitamin D biomarkers to vitamin D supplements in this population.

Methods

We conducted a 16-week randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. Seventy overweight/obese African Americans (age 13–45 years, 84 % females) with 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations ≤20 ng/mL were randomly assigned to receive a supervised monthly oral vitamin D 3 of 18,000 IU (~600 IU/day, n = 17), 60,000 IU (~2000 IU/day, n = 18), 120,000 IU (~4000 IU/day, n = 18), or placebo (n = 17).

Results

There were significant dose- and time-responses of circulating 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH) 2 D]</span>, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), but not fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), phosphorus and urine calcium to the vitamin D supplements. The mean 25(OH)D concentrations in the 2000 IU and 4000 IU groups reached ≥30 ng/mL as early as 8-weeks and remained at similar level at 16-weeks. The increase of 25(OH)D was significantly higher in the 4000 IU group than all the other groups at 8-weeks. The increase of 1,25(OH) 2 D was significantly higher in the 2000 IU and 4000 IU groups than the placebo at 8-weeks. Only the 4000 IU compared to the placebo significantly reduced iPTH at 8- and 16-weeks.

Conclusions

Our RCT, for the first time, comprehensively evaluated time- and dose- responses of vitamin D supplementation in overweight/obese African Americans with suboptimal vitamin D status. Circulating 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and iPTH, but not FGF-23, phosphorus and urine calcium, respond to vitamin D supplementation in a time- and dose–response manner. By monthly dosing, 2000 IU appears to be sufficient in achieving a 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL in this population.  **However, importantly, 4000 IU, rather than 2000 IU, seems to suppress iPTH** . If replicated, these data might be informative in optimizing vitamin D status and providing individualized dosing recommendation in overweight/obese African Americans.
