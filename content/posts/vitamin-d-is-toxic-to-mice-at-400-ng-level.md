# 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D is not responsible for toxicity caused by vitamin D or 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Vitamin D intoxication was produced with oral doses of either vitamin D(3) or 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in CYP27B1 -/- (1?-hydroxylase knockout) and wild-type mice. These compounds were equally toxic in wild-type and the mutant mice. Since the null mutant mice are unable to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, it is clear 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is not responsible for vitamin D intoxication. On the other hand, 25-hydroxyvitamin D rises to levels of  **400-700ng/ml**  or 1000-1750nM in the serum of both groups of mice. Toxicity was evidenced by severe hypercalcemia and weight loss. Measurement of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in serum confirmed its absence from serum of the CYP27B1 -/- mice given 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3). Since high concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D can bind the vitamin D receptor and can induce transcription, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is likely responsible for toxicity of vitamin D excess.
