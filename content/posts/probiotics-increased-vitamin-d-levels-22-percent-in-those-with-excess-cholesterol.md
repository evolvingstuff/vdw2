Context:Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is a risk factor for osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Disruption of non-cholesterol sterol absorption due to cholesterol lowering therapies may result in reduced fat soluble vitamin absorption.

Objective:We have previously reported on the cholesterol lowering efficacy and reduced sterol absorption of probiotic bile salt hydrolase active L. reuteri NCIMB 30242; however, the effects on fat soluble vitamins was previously unknown and the objective of the present study.Design, Settings, 

Patients and Intervention:The study was double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-arm, multi-center lasting 13 weeks. 127 otherwise healthy hypercholesterolemic adults with LDL-cholesterol >3.4 mmol/l, triglycerides <4.0 mmol/l and body mass index of 22-32 kg/m2 were included. Subjects were recruited from 6 private practices in Prague, CZ and randomized to consume L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 or placebo capsules over a 9-week intervention period.

Outcome measures:The primary outcome measure was the change in serum LDL-cholesterol over the 9-week intervention. Analysis of fat soluble vitamins at Weeks 0 and 9 were performed post-hoc.

Results:There were no significant differences between L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 and placebo capsule groups in serum vitamin A, vitamin E, β-carotene or dietary intake over the intervention period (P>0.05). L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D by 14.9 nmol/l or 25.5% over the intervention period, which was a significant mean change relative to placebo of 17.1 nmol/l or  **22.4%**  respectively (P=0.003).

Conclusions:To our knowledge this is the first report of increased circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D in response to oral probiotic supplementation.

> Lactobacillus probiotic

> About 1/3 did not get any increase in vitamin D levels

### Note:

1. Hypercholesterolemia is the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood.

1. While very interesting, people without high cholesterol may not get any vitamin D benefit from Lactobacillus probiotic

1. Likewise, no data on increase of vitamin D from other types of probiotics
