<p>0:00:00.3 Speaker 1: So let&rsquo;s just dive right in. And in general, will you tell us some of your favorite go-to lifestyle-based longevity tips?</p>
<p>0:00:09.9  <strong>Patrick</strong>  Well I think there&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s important to consider low-hanging fruit or things that people&hellip; There&rsquo;s not a lot of resistance and barriers for people to start applying in their daily lives, and I think when it comes to some of the easiest things that people can do, it usually comes down to unfortunately, taking a pill and so I know you might be going What is she talking about? Well, the Micronutrient inadequacies, it&rsquo;s a widespread problem in United States and other developed countries as well, where there&rsquo;s about 30 to 40 essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids that we have to get from our diet, and if we don&rsquo;t get them from our diet, we are going to be inadequate in them, and these essential micronutrients are doing very important things in our body from running our metabolism to making sure our enzymes, which are proteins inside of ourselves that are basically doing all the work responsible for everything from pumping our blood to our immune function to neuro transmitter function, so basically everything, they require these micronutrients, co-factors, and it&rsquo;s definitely I think safe to say that diet, food first approach and getting all your micronutrients from whole foods, eating diverse foods is paramount.</p>
<p>0:01:40.9  <strong>Patrick</strong>  However many people, for whatever reason, they will not do that, they&rsquo;re busy or they have a habit, or there&rsquo;s other sorts of dysregulation, perhaps in satiety mechanisms, and so getting some micronutrients, like some of the important ones from a supplement, and these are easy one, Vitamin D is an easy one. That&rsquo;s something that we usually make in our skin from the sun, and about 70% of the US population has inadequate Vitamin D, and that&rsquo;s kind of defined as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter, if you&rsquo;re in the United States, if you&rsquo;re in Europe, that would&hellip; You&rsquo;d have to multiply that by 2.5. But 70% of the US population has levels below that, and there have been many different meta-analysis over the decades dating back all the way to the 1960s looking at vitamin D levels and all cause mortality, and it&rsquo;s pretty clear that having levels above 30 is associated with a lower all-cause mortality, in other words, people are less likely to die from non-accidental causes of death, whether that&rsquo;s cardiovascular disease, although I would say cardiovascular disease is probably the weakest with respect to vitamin D, cancer mortalities down.</p>
<h5 id="less-sun--less-vitamin-d--more-diseases">Less sun ==&gt; Less Vitamin D ==&gt; more diseases</h5>
<p>0:03:05.4  <strong>Patrick</strong>  Respiratory diseases down. Those are two of the really big ones. The big drivers with respect to lowering all cause mortality. But so taking a vitamin D supplement is one of the easiest things to do, why is the widespread deficiency so common well, because we&rsquo;re inside in our cubicles, in our offices with our technological advances, computers, everything, we don&rsquo;t spend as much time outside doing agriculture, doing the sort of outdoors kind of jobs that were common hundred years ago, so people are not making vitamin D from their skin and on top of that, there are variety of factors that actually regulate whether or not we can make enough Vitamin D in your skin and that from everything from age.</p>
<p>   <a href="/posts/does-less-sun-mean-more-disease" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Does Less Sun mean More Disease">Does Less Sun mean More Disease</a> 5 minute video</p>
<h5 id="seniors-get-only-14-of-the-benefit-from-the-sun-even-less-if-dark-skin-or-obese">Seniors get only 1/4 of the benefit from the sun (even less if dark skin or obese)</h5>
<p>0:03:53.8  <strong>Patrick</strong>  So a 70-year-old person makes literally 25% of what they made as their 20-year-old self, so it&rsquo;s very inefficient as you get older, skin color, so melanin, the pigment that basically acts as a natural sunscreen, also is a filter for UVB radiation, which is actually, what needs to basically penetrate through the skin to start vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin. Because melanin is a natural sunscreen, sunscreen also does that people wear a lot of sunscreen nowadays, so there&rsquo;s many different reasons why people are not getting as much Vitamin D in our modern day world, and vitamin D is one of the cheapest and easiest supplements to take their find studies that have basically try to figure out like. How can you take a person who is deficient, so deficiency would be 20 nanograms from mil or less, and when you start to get less than 20 nanograms per milliliter, you start to go&hellip;</p>
<h5 id="4000-iu--steroid-hormone">4,000 IU ==&gt; steroid hormone</h5>
<p>0:04:55.8  <strong>Patrick</strong>  You start to run the risk of bone problems and severe others have types of server problems, immune dysfunction, for example, people that are deficient and supplement with about 4000 IUs per day, can bring herself up to a sufficient level closer above 30 nanograms per mil, perhaps even closer to 40 and 4000 IUs per day is actually the tolerable upper intake set by the instate medicine for vitamin D3, and I just want to mention, vitamin D is unique among the vitamins because it&rsquo;s actually, it gets converted into a steroid hormone, so Vitamin D3 goes to the liver, it&rsquo;s converted to another metabolite called 25 hydroxy Vitamin D, that&rsquo;s the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D that&rsquo;s usually measured if you get a blood test, and then it goes to the kidneys where it&rsquo;s unconverted into the steroid hormone that&rsquo;s 125-hydroxy Vitamin D.</p>

<p>0:05:58.6  <strong>Patrick</strong>  And what I mean by a steroid hormone, most people think about estrogen, testosterone. Those are steroid hormones. Like imagine if 70% of the men in the United States were deficient in testosterone, they would be terrible. So vitamin D is basically very different because it basically can enter what&rsquo;s called the nucleus of a cell, and that is where all your DNA is, and it can basically recognize this little sequence of DNA, and it basically binds to a receptor and it binds to your DNA and turns genes on, activates them and turns other genes off and deactivate them in this coordinated fashion, and these are genes that are important from everything from brain function so serotonin is one, it&rsquo;s important for the synthesis of serotonin in the brain to immune function, and it&rsquo;s why Vitamin D plays such a critical role in helping prevent respiratory diseases and so&hellip;</p>
<p>0:06:54.9  <strong>Patrick</strong>  Low-hanging fruit there, vitamin D. Easy one.</p>

!!!!Transcript 
0:00:00.3 Speaker 1: So let&#39;s just dive right in. And in general, will you tell us some of your favorite go-to lifestyle-based longevity tips? 

0:00:09.9 __Patrick__ Well I think there&#39;s... It&#39;s important to consider low-hanging fruit or things that people... There&#39;s not a lot of resistance and barriers for people to start applying in their daily lives, and I think when it comes to some of the easiest things that people can do, it usually comes down to unfortunately, taking a pill and so I know you might be going What is she talking about? Well, the Micronutrient inadequacies, it&#39;s a widespread problem in United States and other developed countries as well, where there&#39;s about 30 to 40 essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids that we have to get from our diet, and if we don&#39;t get them from our diet, we are going to be inadequate in them, and these essential micronutrients are doing very important things in our body from running our metabolism to making sure our enzymes, which are proteins inside of ourselves that are basically doing all the work responsible for everything from pumping our blood to our immune function to neuro transmitter function, so basically everything, they require these micronutrients, co-factors, and it&#39;s definitely I think safe to say that diet, food first approach and getting all your micronutrients from whole foods, eating diverse foods is paramount.

0:01:40.9 __Patrick__ However many people, for whatever reason, they will not do that, they&#39;re busy or they have a habit, or there&#39;s other sorts of dysregulation, perhaps in satiety mechanisms, and so getting some micronutrients, like some of the important ones from a supplement, and these are easy one, Vitamin D is an easy one. That&#39;s something that we usually make in our skin from the sun, and about 70% of the US population has inadequate Vitamin D, and that&#39;s kind of defined as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter, if you&#39;re in the United States, if you&#39;re in Europe, that would... You&#39;d have to multiply that by 2.5. But 70% of the US population has levels below that, and there have been many different meta-analysis over the decades dating back all the way to the 1960s looking at vitamin D levels and all cause mortality, and it&#39;s pretty clear that having levels above 30 is associated with a lower all-cause mortality, in other words, people are less likely to die from non-accidental causes of death, whether that&#39;s cardiovascular disease, although I would say cardiovascular disease is probably the weakest with respect to vitamin D, cancer mortalities down.
!!!!!Less sun ==&gt; Less Vitamin D ==&gt; more diseases
0:03:05.4 __Patrick__ Respiratory diseases down. Those are two of the really big ones. The big drivers with respect to lowering all cause mortality. But so taking a vitamin D supplement is one of the easiest things to do, why is the widespread deficiency so common well, because we&#39;re inside in our cubicles, in our offices with our technological advances, computers, everything, we don&#39;t spend as much time outside doing agriculture, doing the sort of outdoors kind of jobs that were common hundred years ago, so people are not making vitamin D from their skin and on top of that, there are variety of factors that actually regulate whether or not we can make enough Vitamin D in your skin and that from everything from age.
{DIV(style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;)} ~hs~~hs~ ((Does Less Sun mean More Disease)) 5 minute video {DIV}
!!!!!Seniors get only 1/4 of the benefit from the sun (even less if dark skin or obese)
0:03:53.8 __Patrick__ So a 70-year-old person makes literally 25% of what they made as their 20-year-old self, so it&#39;s very inefficient as you get older, skin color, so melanin, the pigment that basically acts as a natural sunscreen, also is a filter for UVB radiation, which is actually, what needs to basically penetrate through the skin to start vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin. Because melanin is a natural sunscreen, sunscreen also does that people wear a lot of sunscreen nowadays, so there&#39;s many different reasons why people are not getting as much Vitamin D in our modern day world, and vitamin D is one of the cheapest and easiest supplements to take their find studies that have basically try to figure out like. How can you take a person who is deficient, so deficiency would be 20 nanograms from mil or less, and when you start to get less than 20 nanograms per milliliter, you start to go...
!!!!!4,000 IU ==&gt; steroid hormone
0:04:55.8 __Patrick__ You start to run the risk of bone problems and severe others have types of server problems, immune dysfunction, for example, people that are deficient and supplement with about 4000 IUs per day, can bring herself up to a sufficient level closer above 30 nanograms per mil, perhaps even closer to 40 and 4000 IUs per day is actually the tolerable upper intake set by the instate medicine for vitamin D3, and I just want to mention, vitamin D is unique among the vitamins because it&#39;s actually, it gets converted into a steroid hormone, so Vitamin D3 goes to the liver, it&#39;s converted to another metabolite called 25 hydroxy Vitamin D, that&#39;s the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D that&#39;s usually measured if you get a blood test, and then it goes to the kidneys where it&#39;s unconverted into the steroid hormone that&#39;s 125-hydroxy Vitamin D.
{DIV(style=&quot;font-size:20px;&quot;)} ~hs~~hs~((Vitamin D daily - Evolution: 4,000 IU, Government: 800 IU– Veith Oct 2022))
~hs~~hs~(((4,000 IU of Vitamin D is too small a dose to help Obese - RCT Feb 2022))
~hs~~hs~(((4,000 IU of Vitamin D is OK - 19 organizations agree - 2018)){DIV}

0:05:58.6 __Patrick__ And what I mean by a steroid hormone, most people think about estrogen, testosterone. Those are steroid hormones. Like imagine if 70% of the men in the United States were deficient in testosterone, they would be terrible. So vitamin D is basically very different because it basically can enter what&#39;s called the nucleus of a cell, and that is where all your DNA is, and it can basically recognize this little sequence of DNA, and it basically binds to a receptor and it binds to your DNA and turns genes on, activates them and turns other genes off and deactivate them in this coordinated fashion, and these are genes that are important from everything from brain function so serotonin is one, it&#39;s important for the synthesis of serotonin in the brain to immune function, and it&#39;s why Vitamin D plays such a critical role in helping prevent respiratory diseases and so...

0:06:54.9 __Patrick__ Low-hanging fruit there, vitamin D. Easy one.
