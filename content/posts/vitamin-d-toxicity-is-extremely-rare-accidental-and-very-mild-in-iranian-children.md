* Some children in Iran accidentally took an average of 500,000 IU of Vitamin D in a single day

* Only one of the 15 children became hypercalcemic 

* That single case of hypercalcemia was treated by extra water for 6 hours

   * US Comparison: Of the 25,397 human exposures to excess vitamin D in 2000â€“2014, only 0.02% had health problems (morbidity) and none died.
