The purpose of this study was to identify strength gains after an anterior cruciate ligament injury and surgery and during inflammatory challenge in participants with disparate vitamin D levels. Plasma samples were obtained from those who had not previously experienced an anterior cruciate ligament injury and from injured patients 2 weeks before and 3 months after anterior cruciate ligament surgery. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and cytokine concentrations were measured in each blood sample. Single-leg peak isometric forces were measured 2 weeks presurgery and 3 months postsurgery. Compared with noninjured participants, inflammatory cytokines were elevated prior to and following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 

During this inflammatory challenge, the peak isometric force increases after surgery were significantly lower in those with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <30 ng/mL compared with those with concentrations ?30 ng/mL. The authors conclude that low vitamin D appears to hinder strength recovery after anterior cruciate ligament surgery and during inflammatory insult.
