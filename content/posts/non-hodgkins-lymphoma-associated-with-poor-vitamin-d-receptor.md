Vitamin D (VDR)-mediated signaling contributes to the cell signaling pathways that affect cancer development. This study is conducted on 104 patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and 246 healthy subjects to investigate the link between five genetic variants spanning the VDR gene and the risk of this malignancy in Iranian subjects. The PCR-RFLP method was used for the analysis of BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), FokI (rs2228570) and TaqI (rs731236) variants. A simple Tetra-ARMS-PCR technique was employed for the genotyping of the Cdx2 (rs11568820) variant. No significant link was found between both groups regarding ApaI (rs7975232) and FokI (rs2228570) variants (P > 0.05). Also, different genetic models of TaqI (rs731236), BsmI (rs1544410) and Cdx2 (rs11568820) polymorphisms were significantly correlated to decreased risk of NHL (Odd ratios <1). 

 **We found three haplotypes were strongly associated with an increased risk of NHL (P < 0.0001).**  Linkage-disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed a strong linkage between TaqI (rs731236) and BsmI (rs1544410) among NHL case and control subjects. Our findings indicated that functional variants of the VDR gene are linked to a decreased risk of NHL in our population. Further replication studies in different ethnic groups are needed to validate our results.
