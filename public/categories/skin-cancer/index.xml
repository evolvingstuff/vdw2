!Vitamin D, UV, and skin cancer in the elderly: to expose or not to expose?
Glossmann H.
Gerontology. 2011;57(4):350-3. Epub 2010 Dec 22.
Institute for Biochemical Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. Hartmut.Glossmann@i-med.ac.at

There is mounting concern about vitamin D insufficiency, especially in the ageing population. Increases in indoor lifestyle, obesity, car travel, clothing habits, the use of photo-protective makeup, and campaigns driven by dermatologists, governments, and the cosmetic industry to avoid or protect against the sun as much as possible are contributing to this trend. 

In a recent article in Gerontology, Barysch et al. [1] recommend that the ageing population avoid any &amp;#39;intentional&amp;#39; UV radiation as well as &amp;#39;minimize sun exposure&amp;#39; based on known dangers of developing skin cancer. They warn that &amp;#39;studies with vitamin D supplements reported increased risks of prostate and esophagus cancer as well as atopy in childhood&amp;#39; and concluded that &amp;#39;adequate levels of vitamin D are essential for the elderly&amp;#39;, but do not suggest which level is optimal. I will argue that the ageing population should keep their serum 25-(OH)-vitamin D(3) (25-(OH)-D) levels in the 75-100 nmol/l range. An oral cholecalciferol intake of ?2,000 IU/day is recommended as a supplement throughout the year for those who cannot enjoy the sun in summer or only during &amp;#39;vitamin D winter&amp;#39; for the others.

!!Interesting statements in the paper
*Intense (with sunburns) and intermittent (vacation or weekend) UVR exposure, especially in early childhood, predispose to MM
*The MM risk of the trunk and limbs increases with a higher socioeconomic status (more recreational, intermittent sun exposure) but is surprisingly largely uninfluenced by latitude and ambient UV-B radiation [15]
*. . the incidence has been rising continuously since as early as 1940, but this increase has mainly occurred in indoor but not outdoor workers. . .
*. .higher 25-(OH)-D levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with both thinner tumors and better survival . . .
*’Nitric oxide production in the skin is increased at the same time by UV-A, which lowers the system blood pressure, indicating that there are many activities of natural sunlight extending beyond vitamin D
*Are your chances of dying – compared to a population without BCC or SCC – better or worse? 
+The answer is surprising and unexpected: 
+you are going to live longer, by ~9%, if you have been diagnosed with a BCC based on a 10–year mortality rate ratio (MRR = 0.91)

(all of the following are on the VitaminDWiki, but do not have time to make all of the hyperlinks)
*Seniors need 3X as much time in the sun to get same amount of vitamin D
*Need about 2X more if overweight
*Various anti-oxidants reduce the chance of sunburns
*Maximize the amount of vitamin D while minimizing the chance of sunburn 
+by spending a small amount of time out in the hot sun with a minimum of clothing.
*Perhaps having enough vitamin D reduces chance of sunburning
