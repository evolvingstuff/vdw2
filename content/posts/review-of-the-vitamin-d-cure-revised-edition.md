# Initial notes on the revised book by Henry Lahore May 2012

* Vitamin D Truth – You should supplement your vitamin D in a weight-bases dose . .  Pg 14

> Fails to mention the <a href="/posts/10-other-reasons-that-more-vitamin-d-would-be-needed" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1586">10+ other reasons that more vitamin D would be needed</a>

* Pre-vitamin D is made in the liver and the ultraviolet B sunlight plus heat twist the pre-vitamin D in a reaction which forms vitamin D3 in the skin pg 18

> Wrong – see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Previtamin_D3) and many others

* Mentions that vitamin A is needed with vitamin D pg 19

> Does not mention how much vitamin A

* ‘’The more melanin you have in your skin the faster you tan’’ pg 20

> Mistake – more melanin will result in slower tanning

* Some foods (such as cheese) increase acid in the body. Pg 23 The kidney flushes acid out of the body by buffering the acid with Potassium, Magnesium and Calcium. 

> The loss of these minerals makes vitamin D less effective. Also, the kidney does not do this function as well as you age. 

* Netherlands public policy 30 years ago that all newborns receive 2,000 IU of vitamin D (in cod-liver oil) to prevent rickets pg 53

> unable to find a reference for that.  [CLICK HERE](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1431&preview%20) for Finnish,  2,000 IU 

* Dr. Hollis found that moms needed 4,000 IU or more to optimize vitamin D in breast milk pg 54

> Mistake – <a href="/posts/moms-needed-6400-iu" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1102">moms needed 6400 IU</a> for breastfeeding.  4,000 IU was enough only during pregnancy

* Recent research shows that high salt (sodium chloride) intakes causes your kidneys to break down and discard vitamin D pg 71

> unable to find reference which supports this

> did find indication that<a href="/posts/salt-reduces-the-cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2737">salt reduces the cofactors</a> (Magnesium and Calcium) needed to utilize vitamin D

* Vitamin K briefly mentioned pg 99

> Fails to differentiate between K2 and K1, 

> Fails to mention <a href="/posts/k2-importance-as-of-cofactor-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 765">K2 importance as of cofactor of Vitamin D</a>

* Suggests taking almost as much Magnesium as causes loose stools pg 100

> Magnesium is good, but there are <a href="/posts/many-alternate-forms-of-magnesum-which-the-body-can-tolerate" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 947">many alternate forms of Magnesum which the body can tolerate</a>  – such as Malate and liquid

* Calcium is 2X more bio-available at 35 ng vs 20 ng level of vitamin D pg 103

> Agreed – many people will not need Calcium supplements once they get enough vitamin D

* Excess salt can cause the loss of 100 milligrams of Calcium per day pg 103

> Even if have high level of vitamin D a person will need 200 mg as much Calcium to replace that lost by high amount of salt in diet.

* Recommends 20-25 IU of vitamin D per lb of body weight pg 105

> Example: 4,000 to 5,000 IU for a 200 lb person

* Half-life of vitamin D is 10 weeks pg 206

> Fails to mention that half life depends on the vitamin D level.  Perhaps dropping to 4 weeks for vitamin D levels > 60 nanograms

* Vitamin D2 is not as effective and does not persist as much as Vitami D3

> Fails to mention that vets no longer use [D2 for mammals  due to adverse affects](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&btnG=Google+Search&googles.x=0&googles.y=0&q=mammals+d2&domains=www.VitaminDWiki.com&sitesearch=www.VitaminDWiki.com%20)

> Also: <a href="/posts/d3-is-30x-to-40x-more-effective-than-d2-in-poultry" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1435">D3 is 30X to 40X more effective than D2 in poultry</a>

* Book recommends screening everyone for vitamin D deficiency pg 208

> Unlikely that any govt will pay for vitamin D testing of the entire population

* Suggests the use on polyunsaturated fats pg 212

> <a href="/posts/monounsaturated-fats" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1903">Monounsaturated fats</a> (such as almonds) provides better vitamin D bioavailability than polyunsaturated fats
