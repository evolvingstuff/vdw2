* “Among the study’s 200 participants with inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who all received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy via Opdivo (nivolumab) or Keytruda (pembrolizumab), the objective response rate (ORR) among patients with low vitamin D levels which were not supplemented was  **36.2%_ , while the response rate was** 56%__ for patients with either normal baseline levels of vitamin D or those who obtained normal levels via supplementation, according to the study.”

* “The study — which was conducted by a team of Polish researchers and the results of which were published in the journal Cancer — also found that patients with normal vitamin D levels had a median progression-free survival (PFS, the time a patient lives without the disease spreading or becoming worse) of 11.25 months, **nearly double**  the duration of the 5.75-month median PFS among patients with low levels of vitamin D.”
