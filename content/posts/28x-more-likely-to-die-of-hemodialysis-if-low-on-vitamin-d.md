Background:Vitamin D deficiency and protein-energy wasting (PEW) are highly prevalent in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The goal of our study was to investigate if a lack of vitamin D influences mortality and hospitalization of HD patients with or without PEW. Methods: In 81 chronic HD patients with different nutritional status assessed by the Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS), vitamin D deficiency (25-OH-vitamin D(3) levels ?30 nmol/l or  **?12 ng/ml** ) was prospectively investigated for its prognostic impact on mortality and hospitalization. Over a 3-year follow-up, all-cause mortality and hospitalization were determined. The predictive value of low vitamin D levels and PEW as well as their combined effect were evaluated using a multivariate Cox regression model. 

Results: Vitamin D deficiency was frequent in HD patients with and without PEW. It significantly increased mortality rate in HD patients ( **HR 2.76**  (1.33-5.73), p < 0.01), which was aggravated by concomitant  **PEW (HR 5.88**  (2.29-15.09), p < 0.001). The hospitalization rate, however, was not influenced independently by nutritional status. 

Conclusions: Low 25-OH-vitamin D(3) concentration is an independent predictor for survival, but not for hospitalization of HD patients. It is not merely a malnutrition-associated finding, although a MIS ?8 further impaired survival prognosis.

#### Vitamin D status and mortality of German hemodialysis patients.- 2012

AIM: The goal was to analyze the link between blood levels of calcidiol and all-cause, cardiac and infectious diseases, and mortality due to cancer in hemodialysis patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated a representative sub-cohort (n=6,518) of German hemodialysis patients from the incidence cohorts 1997-2006.

RESULTS: Most (58.8%) were found to be vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D<20 ng/ml), with 41.2% being severely deficient (25(OH)D<12.5 ng/ml). All-cause mortality risk more than doubled in patients with severe deficiency (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.67; 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.30-3.10; p<0.0001). Comparable data were obtained for mortality from cardiac disease (aOR=1.57; 95% CI=1.30-1.88; p<0.0001), infectious disease (aOR=1.48; 95% CI=1.15-1.90; p=0.0026), and cancer (aOR=1.51; 95% CI=1.09-2.08; p=0.0121), respectively.

CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need to ensure primarily adequate 25(OH)D levels in dialysis patients for an advantage of survival.
