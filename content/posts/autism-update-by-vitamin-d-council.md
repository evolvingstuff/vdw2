#### Vitamin D Announcements 23 June 2010 Is Scientific American right about autism?

A Scientific Americanarticle asks, "What if Vitamin D  Deficiency is a Cause of Autism?" (1)  How could vitamin D deficiency  during pregnancy cause autism, a genetic disease? Indeed, five  researchers at Harvard, led by Dr. Dennis Kinney, recently endorsed and  modified the [vitamin D theory of autism](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/health/autism/). (2)

Dr. Darryl Eyles, of the University of Queensland, added his name to  growing list of scientists who agree that vitamin D deficiency plays an  important role in autism. (3)  Writing in Acta Paediatrica,  arguably the most read pediatric journal in the world, Dr. Eyles praised  the vitamin D theory of autism as being "parsimonious," with the animal  studies he has conducted over the last decade.

For the last 15 years, geneticists have tried and failed to find a  common structural genetic abnormality in autism. What they have found is  evidence of genetic damage; the genetic code is not properly regulated  in autism, with multiple genes not being expressed, probably due to an  environmental injury. As Dr. Kinney reports, vitamin D's mechanism of  action is protection of the genome with direct regulation more than  1,000 human genes.

If the gestational and early childhood vitamin D deficiency theory of  autism is true, the tragedy is more poignant in that physicians could  prevent the disease with adequate daily doses of vitamin D during  pregnancy and early childhood. Just as important, vitamin D's mechanism  of action implies a treatment effect in autistic children.

This month, Acta Paediatrica, published yet another article  on vitamin D and autism. This paper is open access; the pdf is free to  download. (4) In the paper, Dr. Cannell reviews the evidence of vitamin  D's involvement in autism, including evidence published after his  original 2007 paper. (5)
