Purpose

In this study, we determined serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> levels in serum, and investigated their associations with risk of recurrent stroke and mortality in a 24-month follow up study in Chinese patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.

Methods

In this preplanned post hoc analysis, serum levels of 25(OH) D and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) were measured at the time of admission in a cohort of patients with ischemic stroke. We used logistic regression model to assess the relationship between 25(OH) D levels and risk recurrent stroke or mortality.

Results

The follow-up rate was 98.2% in 220 stroke patients. Of 216 patients, 18.5% (95%CI: 13.3%–23.7%) patients had a stroke recurrence, and 30.1% (95% CI: 24.0%–36.2%) died. After adjustment for traditional risk factors, serum 25(OH) D levels were negatively associated with the risk of stroke recurrence (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>, 0.77; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.70–0.85; P< 0.001) and negatively associated with mortality during 24 months of follow-up (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64–0.80; P< 0.001). Compared with the first quartile of serum 25(OH) D levels, the ORs for  **stroke recurrence and mortality**  were as follows: 

* second quartile, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63–0.93) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65–0.89); 

* third quartile, 0.42 (95% CI, 0.31–0.55) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.30–0.52); 

* fourth quartile, 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07–0.19) and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.15), respectively.

Conclusions

Lower serum levels of 25(OH) D are independently associated with the stroke recurrence and mortality at 24 months in ischemic stroke patients.
