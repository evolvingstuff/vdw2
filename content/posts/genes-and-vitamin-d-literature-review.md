 **Highlights** 

• We review a total of 120 genetic association studies on vitamin D pathway SNP

• Significant associations reported for a total of 55 SNP in 11 vit D pathway genes

• 44 studies report 114 findings of SNP which determine metabolite concentration

• 76 studies report 105 findings of SNP which affect non-skeletal health outcomes

• Infectious and auto-immune related disease were most frequent to associate with SNP

• Limited overlap of SNP predicting vit D status and SNP affecting disease outcomes

Polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in vitamin D metabolism and transport are recognised to influence vitamin D status. Syntheses of genetic association studies linking these variants to non-skeletal health outcomes are lacking. We therefore conducted a literature review to identify reports of statistically significant associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 11 vitamin D pathway genes (

* DHCR7, 

* CYP2R1, 

* CYP3A4, 

* CYP27A1, 

* DBP, 

* LRP2, 

* CUB, 

* CYP27B1, 

* CYP24A1, 

* VDR and 

* RXRA) 

and non-bone health outcomes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D). A total of 120 genetic association studies reported positive associations, of which 44 investigated determinants of circulating 25(OH)D and / or 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, and 76 investigated determinants of non-skeletal health outcomes. Statistically significant associations were reported for a total of 55 SNP in the 11 genes investigated. There was limited overlap between genetic determinants of vitamin D status and those associated with non-skeletal health outcomes: polymorphisms in DBP, CYP2R1 and DHCR7 were the most frequent to be reported to associate with circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D, while polymorphisms in VDR were most commonly reported to associate with non-skeletal health outcomes, among which infectious and autoimmune diseases were the most represented.
