### [Vitamin D Council review of study](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/vitamin-d-helps-prevent-falls-and-improve-balance-according-to-study/) Dec 2015

 **Includes the following** 

. .  this study satisfied most of Professor Robert Heaney’s suggestions for a high quality vitamin D randomized controlled trial: 

* 1) The women were frequent fallers (they were tested for the condition); 

* 2) baseline 25(OH)D levels were low, 

* 3) a substantial dose of vitamin D was used; ~~#00F:(Note:no #4)~~

* 5) After nine months, blood tests confirmed the vitamin D group experienced a substantial increase in 25(OH)D levels, while the placebo group did not; 

* 6) a corollary test was performed (balance) that agreed with the primary end point. 

The only thing the researchers didn’t do was administer vitamin D co-factors (magnesium, zinc, boron and vitamin K), but very few if any studies do that.
