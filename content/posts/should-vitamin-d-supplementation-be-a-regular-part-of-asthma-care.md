### KEY POINTS

* Vitamin D (vitD3) is important for immune system function.

* Low vitD3 may initiate asthma

* VitD3 supplements may treat steroid-resistant asthma, reduce steroid-induced bone toss, improve immunotherapy (IT), decrease infections, and inhibit remodeling. Unfortunately, there are few adequate double-blind treatment studies.

* Calcidiol should be measured in every allergy patient. Accepted calcidiol serum values are leas than 25 nmol/L (deficiency) and less than 50 to 72.5 nmol/L (insufficiency).

* VitD3 supplements up to 10,000 IU daily are safe. However, because of person-to-person variability in calcidiol levels produced by any supplement dose, calcidiol levels must be measured during treatment.

* Because it will be years until there is certainty about vitD3 benefits and optimum treatment levels, the decision to supplement depends on the severity of disease. history of infection and steroid use. IT status, and calcidiol level.
