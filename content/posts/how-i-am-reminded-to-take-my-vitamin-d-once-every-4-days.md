#### A visual reminder of when to take my vitamin D

 **If I happen to miss that day, I take them the next day or so.** 

 **Currently I am taking 2 capsules of 50,000 IU every 4 days** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Which is an average of 25,000 IU per day** 

 **Scores of studies have found that taking vitamin D infrequently is [Better than Daily](/categories/better-than-daily)** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Unaware of a single study which has found daily to be better** 

 **[18 organizations have stated that 4,000 IU daily average is OK](/posts/4000-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-ok-19-organizations-agree-2018)** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **If you believe that to be true, taking 50,000 IU once every two weeks would be fine (3,600 IU daily average)** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **If you do not also take [cofactors](/posts/vitamin-d-cofactors-in-a-nutshell) such as Magnesium and Vitamin K, then probably 4,000 IU should be the upper limit** 

 **Taking 50,000 IU [once every 2 weeks has been proven to treat 22 health problems](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Note: Taking 50,000 IU once a week treats an additional 18 health problems** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **So, once a week should treat a total of at least <span style="color:#F00;">40 </span>health problems**
