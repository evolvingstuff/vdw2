#### [FDA Admits Most Sunscreens Are Probably Unsafe](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/03/13/sunscreen-safety-regulations.aspx) Mercola March 2019

* "Of the 16 active sunscreen ingredients used in products on the U.S. market, only two — non-nano-sized zinc oxide and titanium dioxide — have been deemed safe for human use by the FDA"

* FDA admits scientific data are lacking for 12 active sunscreen ingredients on its list, and asks industry to help in providing more data in order to perform a “rigorous assessment” of all active ingredients on the market"

* "One of the 12 active sunscreen ingredients the FDA claims to be unsure about is oxybenzone, found in an estimated 70 percent of sunscreens. Evidence suggests oxybenzone is an endocrine disruptor, and it is known to decimate coral reefs and harm aquatic life"

* "Research shows 13 of 29 sunscreen chemicals (45 percent) allowed in the U.S. and/or European Union have the ability to reduce male fertility by affecting calcium signaling in sperm, in part by exerting a progesterone-like effect"

* ...FDA wants sunscreens with an SPF of 15 or higher to provide broad spectrum protection against  **both UVA and UVB rays** , not just UVB as is currently the case."

* "Many Sunscreen Ingredients Have Endocrine Disrupting Effects"
