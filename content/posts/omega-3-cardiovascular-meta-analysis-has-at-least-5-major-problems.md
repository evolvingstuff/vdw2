1.  **This is yet another meta-analysis which ignores dose sizes** 

> Omega-3 dosing ranged from 226 to 1800 mg/d (an 8 X range)

> Imagine a similar meta-analysis for aspirin with an 8X range: 40 mg  325 mg

> I suspect that such a meta-analysis would conclude that aspirin does not help headaches

1.  **This study also primarily looks at people who already had heart attacks and strokes – to see if  Omega-3 might decrease risk of future events (see table below)** 

> &nbsp;

1.  **This study does not appear to ignore cardiovascular problems during the first year when the Omega-3 levels were most likely not raised much – so would not expected to provide any benefit** 

> &nbsp;

1.  **No attempt was made to reduce Omega-6 in the diet – the 6/3 ratio is the important parameter** 

> &nbsp;

1.  **No attempt was made to actually measure the Omega-3 levels in the blood – [a very low-cost blood test](/posts/omega-3-is-vital-for-health-mail-in-test-is-low-cost-and-accurate)**
