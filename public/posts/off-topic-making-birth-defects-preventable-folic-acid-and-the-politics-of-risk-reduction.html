Building on initial clinical research in the United Kingdom, folic acid supplementation has been shown to lower the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs). Recent debate has focused principally on the need for mandatory fortification of grain products with this vitamin. This article takes a longer view, tracing the transformation of folic acid from a routine prenatal supplement to reduce the risk of anaemia to a routine ‘pre-conceptional’ supplement to ‘prevent’ birth defects. Understood in the 1950s in relation to social problems of poverty and malnutrition, NTDs were by the end of the century more likely to be attributed to individual failings. This transition was closely associated with a second. Folic acid supplements were initially prescribed to ‘high-risk’ women who had previously borne a child with a NTD. By the mid-1990s, they were recommended for all women of childbearing age. The acceptance of folic acid as a ‘risk-reducing drug’ both relied upon and helped to advance the development of preventive and clinical practices concerned with women’s health before pregnancy.</p></p></div><h2 id=kwd_1><p>Keywords</h2></p><ul class=keyword id=kg005><li id=k0005><p><span>Folic acid</span>;</li></p><li id=k0010><p><span>Vitamin supplements</span>;</li></p><li id=k0015><p><span>Pre-conception</span>;</li></p><li id=k0020><p><span>Public health</span>;</li></p><li id=k0025><p><span>Clinical trials</span>;</li></p><li id=k0030><p><span>Risk</span></li></p></ul><hr class=artHeader><h2 class=svArticle id=s0005><ol><li>Introduction: folic acid and risk reduction</h2></li></ol><p class="svArticle section" id=p0005><p>Since the mid-1990s, governments and health organizations around the world have adopted policies designed to increase women’s dietary intake of ‘folic acid’ before and during pregnancy in order to reduce the risk of having a baby with a defect of the brain and/or spinal cord. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, a B-group vitamin naturally present in many foodstuffs, particularly leafy green vegetables, and presumed essential for cell growth and development. Neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida are among the most common congenital malformations and a significant cause of neonatal mortality worldwide (<span id=bb0160><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0160 id=ancbb0160>Blencowe, Cousens, Modell, & Lawn, 2010</a></span>). The proposed link between dietary folate deficiency and birth defects has convinced several countries to fortify grain products with folic acid (<span id=bb0745><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0745 id=ancbb0745>Semba, 2006, p. 176</a></span>).

This article offers the first history of how taking a folic acid supplement became both a common part of the experience of pregnancy and a drug that promises to reduce individual risk.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0010><p>Policies to encourage folic acid consumption are characteristic of the emphasis on risk prevention that came to dominate the management of health and disease in developed countries after 1945 (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0145 id=bb0145>Berridge, 1999</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0175 id=bb0175>Brandt, 1997</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0725 id=bb0725>Rothstein, 2003</a>). They are also a symptom of a broader trend in which the risk to the unborn fetus has displaced the risk of maternal mortality as the main focus of the medical interventions in pregnancy and childbirth (<span id=bb0530><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0530 id=ancbb0530>Lupton, 2012</a></span>). Increased emphasis on the management of risk in childbirth since World War Two has justified the expansion of obstetric surveillance ever earlier into pregnancy (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0115 id=bb0115>Arney, 1982</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0895 id=bb0895>Weir, 2006</a>). However, risk prevention strategies have often developed in piecemeal fashion and cannot be attributed solely to professional aspirations to extend the scope of obstetric control. Studying the long-term trajectory of folic acid helps to recover the complex medical, social and political contingencies that helped to drive this shift.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0015><p>Historians have long recognized that ‘risk-reducing’ interventions have not only enhanced the medical scrutiny of subjectively healthy populations, but also constituted novel categories of patients and disease states. Commercial promotion, professional enthusiasm and consumer demand for preventive medical interventions in chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes have blurred the boundary between statistical risk and experienced illness, creating both symptomless ‘pre-patients’ and treatments for ‘proto-diseases’ (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0125 id=bb0125>Aronowitz, 2009</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0385 id=bb0385>Greene, 2007</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0515 id=bb0515>Löwy, 2010</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0715 id=bb0715>Rosenberg, 2007</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0860 id=bb0860>Valier, 2012</a>). In a similar fashion, this article suggests, the acceptance of folic acid as a ‘risk-reducing drug’ both relied upon and helped to advance the development of a novel set of preventive and clinical practices concerned with women’s health before pregnancy. Originating around 1980, strategies to promote both ‘pre-conception’ or ‘pre-pregnancy’ care and ‘pre-conceptional’ vitamin supplementation evolved in close relation and were mutually reinforcing.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0020><p>What kind of intervention is pre-conceptional vitamin supplementation? A complete answer would require an international and cross-disciplinary history over at least the last half-century. Research on folic acid was—and remains—global and multi-sited; individual clinical trials could span several countries, as we shall see. Yet even as the postwar globalization and homogenization of biomedical knowledge helped constitute folic acid as a risk-reducing drug, research into this vitamin and strategies to promote its consumption were also local initiatives, producing local responses. Expert disagreement over mandatory folic acid fortification has generated considerable international policy controversy over such issues as individual versus social responsibility, medical surveillance, the effectiveness of health education, and the risk and benefits of population-based interventions with unknown long-term consequences. This article puts these global debates aside for now in order to recover the ‘natural history’ of folate deficiency in pregnancy as a health risk.<span id=bfn2><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn2 id=ancbfn2><sup>2</sup></a></span> Instead, it focuses on the United Kingdom where much of the important research was done.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0025><p>A British paediatrician, Richard Smithells, is credited with suggesting the ‘causal’ link between folate deficiency and NTDs, which a multi-centre clinical trial conducted by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) is typically claimed to have confirmed. First tracing the history of folic acid in Britain, I propose that two factors significantly shaped this research and its local reception: one, the longstanding and widespread acceptance of vitamins, including folic acid, as beneficial to pregnant women; two, the rise to political prominence of spina bifida, the most common NTD, from the late-1960s. The second half of the article analyses the controversy around the MRC clinical trial and its immediate aftermath. This focus illuminates the multiple constituencies involved in the co-construction of folic acid as a risk-reducing drug and pre-conception care. I suggest that the controversy mobilized a heterogeneous set of actors—research scientists, clinicians, food and drugs companies, activists and journalists—with different interpretations of risk and uncertainty to claim a stake in pre-conceptional vitamin supplements as a means of preventing NTDs.</p></p><h2 class=svArticle id=s0010><ol start=2><li>From Marmite to folic acid: vitamin supplements in pregnancy</h2></li></ol><p class="svArticle section" id=p0030><p>Dietary prescriptions had long been a staple of informal health guidance to expectant and nursing mothers before rising concern about infant mortality around 1900 consolidated the status of nutritional advice in voluntary and statutory systems of maternal and child welfare (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0235 id=bb0235>Cody, 2011</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0320 id=bb0320>Dwork, 1987</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0635 id=bb0635>Oakley, 1984</a>). In the following decades, pregnant women were identified as important beneficiaries of the new knowledge of vitamins, deployed by not only medical practitioners and public health workers, but also charitable, educational and campaigning organizations. Manufacturers of ‘nutrient-rich’ proprietary foods such as Marmite, made from yeast extract, Stork margarine and the stabilized wheatgerm Bemax stressed that ‘vitamin need’ was ‘especially important in the case of the expectant mother, as any Maternity or Child Welfare centre will confirm’. The marketing of vitamin supplements as ‘indispensible’ for pregnant women, ‘for their own sake <em>and</em> that of the child’, extended a long tradition of emphasizing family nutrition as mothers’ responsibility and duty ( <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0105 id=bb0105>Apple, 1996</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0095 id=bb0095>Apple, 1995</a>).<span id=bfn3><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn3 id=ancbfn3><sup>3</sup></a></span></p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0035><p>Many interwar health workers were convinced of the value of Marmite and other vitamin-rich preparations in reducing the risk of death in childbirth. By distributing Marmite and other supplements to working-class expectant mothers in England and Wales, the voluntary National Birthday Trust Fund and the People’s League of Health could combine relief with research into the impact of prenatal nutrition on maternal mortality (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0840 id=bb0840>The People’s League of Health, 1946</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0900 id=bb0900>Williams, 1997</a>). This conviction informed official wartime nutrition policies. The supply of free or cheap vitamin A and D tablets, milk, orange juice and cod liver oil to expectant mothers and children through the wartime vitamin welfare scheme, with their perceived role in the decline of maternal mortality, consolidated the importance of dietary supplements in pregnancy. At the war’s end, the Ministry of Food could declare that the national provision of milk and vitamin supplements to these ‘priority groups has probably done more than any other single factor to promote the health of expectant mothers and young children’ (quoted in <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0635>Oakley, 1984</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0815 id=bb0815>Sultan, 2010</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0945 id=bb0945>Zweiniger-Bargielowska, 2000</a>).</p></p></div><div class=page_fragment id=frag_2><p class="svArticle section" id=p0040><p>Like for other vitamins and vitamin products, the relations between medical researchers, philanthropists, industry and pregnant women in the 1930s helped constitute the therapeutic identity of folic acid (<span id=bb0450><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0450 id=ancbb0450>Kamminga, 1998</a></span>). Working in India in the 1930s, the British pathologist Lucy Wills described a severe and often fatal anaemia associated with pregnancy that was especially prevalent among undernourished urban textile workers. The symptoms of ‘tropical macrocytic anaemia’ closely resembled those of pernicious anaemia, established by 1934 as a disease curable by liver extract (<span id=bb0880><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0880 id=ancbb0880>Wailoo, 1999, pp. 99–133</a></span>). In research funded by the Lady Tata Memorial trust, founded by the Indian businessman Dorabji Tata in 1932, Wills and her collaborators studied the effects of dietary manipulation in albino rats, rhesus monkeys and hospital patients in Bombay and later in London. She observed that macrocytic anaemia could be treated effectively with both crude liver and yeast extract supplied by the Marmite Food Extract Company.

While many theories were discounted as quickly as they were proposed, the possibility that vitamin deficiencies increased the risk of NTDs remained persuasive.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0110><p>In the 1960s, the paediatrician Richard Smithells collaborated with local obstetricians in researching folate metabolism in reproduction in Liverpool, noted for its high NTD prevalence.

Smithells then started a series of small-scale studies that suggested a ‘significant relationship’ between a positive FIGlu test for folate deficiency and fetal malformation (<span id=bb0425><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0425 id=ancbb0425>Hibbard & Smithells, 1965</a></span>). With funding from the ARCC and the Children’s Research Fund, a Lancashire-based charity established in the wake of thalidomide, Smithells built a research group at the University of Leeds to investigate the broader role of drugs and nutrition in pregnancy and birth defects (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0775 id=bb0775>Smithells et al., 1976</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0780 id=bb0780>Smithells et al., 1977</a>). Motivated by the view that the diagnosis and termination of a fetus with spina bifida was a ‘poor substitute for prevention’ (<span id=bb0090><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0090 id=ancbb0090>Anon, 1992, p. 1062</a></span>), Smithells proposed to subject the folate hypothesis to the scrutiny of a clinical trial. What if a woman ‘at risk’ of having a child with an NTD could be given supplementary vitamins <em>before</em> her next pregnancy? Thalidomide had revealed that drugs could harm the developing fetus, but could a pharmaceutical product be shown to <em>prevent</em> birth defects?</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0115><p>Such an experiment was plausible only in a British medical and social landscape transformed by thalidomide and the legalization of abortion. The rapid expansion of prenatal diagnosis in the ten years after the Abortion Act consolidated the genetic counselling clinics from which women with a history of an NTD pregnancy could be recruited. Yet the possibility of a trial relied upon not only the willingness of what the tabloid press came to call ‘heartbreak mums’ to be recruited, but also the construction of spina bifida as an ‘urgent’ problem for the medical profession, charities and society at large. Launching a clinical trial in 1977, Smithells would transform folic acid from a routine prenatal vitamin to reduce the risk of anaemia into an experimental drug for preventing NTDs in ‘high-risk mothers’.</p></p><h2 class=svArticle id=s0020><ol start=4><li>Trialing pre-conceptional vitamin supplements and ‘high-risk mothers’</h2></li></ol><p class="svArticle section" id=p0120><p>Smithells’ team at Leeds, with collaborators in Manchester, Chester and London, succeeded in recruiting 137 ‘study mothers’ into a trial of ‘Pregnavite Forte F’, a multivitamin containing folic acid manufactured by the British pharmaceutical company Beecham and available only on prescription.

A second group of 187 women who were already pregnant when referred to the study or who declined to take supplements were used as controls. The preliminary findings, published in the <em>Lancet</em> in 1980, suggested that the NTD recurrence rate in supplemented mothers was around half that of the control group (<span id=bb0785><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0785 id=ancbb0785>Smithells et al., 1980</a></span>). Smithells framed this research as contributing to the ‘primary prevention’ of malformations, as opposed to ‘secondary prevention’ through prenatal screening. The promise of reducing not only birth incidence of neural-tube defects but also the need for selective termination made this an ‘exciting finding’ in the context of continued debate over abortion ( <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0070 id=bb0070>Anon, 1980</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0285 id=bb0285>Davis, 1985</a>).</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0125><p>In the weeks and months following its publication, Smithells’ report attracted a lively correspondence in the <em>Lancet</em>. Critics rounded on the design of the trial; in particular, the ‘self-selecting’ method of recruiting participants and the use of a ‘blunderbuss’ multivitamin. Smithells and his colleagues were accused of inducing women to ‘self-administer large quantities of multivitamins’ on the basis of a trial that was not properly controlled, and failing to resolve uncertainty over the causal relationship between folic acid and NTDs.<span id=bfn7><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn7 id=ancbfn7><sup>7</sup></a></span> Despite these doubts, the practical response of many clinicians was to behave as if there was a link. Within months, genetic counsellors were ‘already recommending <a class=wiki href=Pregnavite rel>Pregnavite</a> to mothers with a history of NTD pregnancies’ (MRC file note, National Archives FD23/5150). Many clinicians were prepared to accept Smithells’ results as imperfect, but adequate in practical terms. For epidemiologists, however, the design of the trial could not support valid conclusions of cause and effect and—potentially worse—generated new risks over the actions of vitamins that were ‘imperfectly understood’.<span id=bfn8><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn8 id=ancbfn8><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></p></div><div class=page_fragment id=frag_4><p class="svArticle section" id=p0130><p>Long-term prenatal multivitamin supplementation raised the spectre of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES), recently found to have caused genital malformations and cervical cancer in the daughters of pregnant women to whom it was prescribed to prevent miscarriage (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0210 id=bb0210>Chalmers and Sacks, 1982</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0475 id=bb0475>Langston, 2010</a>). To Smithells’ critics, the poorly designed trial rendered Pregnavite ‘of such uncertain efficacy and safety that it should be regarded as a subject of clinical research rather than accepted medical practice’ (MRC press release, National Archives FD23/5152). While acknowledging the need for more research, Smithells and his supporters employed the language of ‘promise’ and ‘guarded optimism’ (MRC file, National Archives FD23/5150). Those for whom a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was the bottom line spoke of continued ‘uncertainty’ and new ‘risks’. Even as medical practitioners prescribed vitamins to high-risk mothers, the debate over the credibility of existing data intensified. The decision of the Medical Research Council, at the request of the UK government, to initiate a randomized controlled trial of pre-conceptional vitamin supplementation marked the start of a more public phase in what was later claimed as ‘one of the great medical controversies of the twentieth century’ (<span id=bb0810><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0810 id=ancbb0810>Stone, 1991</a></span>).</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0135><p>The randomized clinical trial (RCT) had, by around 1970, gained a form of scientific and bureaucratic orthodoxy as the ‘gold standard’ of postwar biomedical research (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0375 id=bb0375>Goodman et al., 2003</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0510 id=bb0510>Löwy, 1996</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0545 id=bb0545>Marks, 1997</a>). The epistemological success of the multi-centre RCT in Britain was largely the achievement of the MRC, whose pioneering trials of the anti-tuberculosis drug streptomycin in the late 1940s laid the parameters for biomedical research during a period of increased centralization of health policy and planning. Supporting the new role of the state as ‘scientific entrepreneur’, the MRC pursued RCTs as ‘a means of unifying a research landscape that was characterized by localism’ (<span id=bb0865><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0865 id=ancbb0865>Valier & Timmerman, 2008, p. 494</a></span>). Research into the role of folate deficiency in reproduction had certainly been located in heterogeneous disciplinary traditions that served various academic, clinical, and charitable agendas. The suggestion that pre-conceptional vitamins could reduce NTD prevalence by half now had such significant health policy implications as to push the MRC to become involved. Should the state fund the provision of folic acid supplements, or a proprietary multivitamin at more than 35 times the cost?<span id=bfn9><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn9 id=ancbfn9><sup>9</sup></a></span> How, above all, to reach women before they became pregnant? Official recognition of the need for a multi-centre RCT not only reflected the view that previous studies, with their diverse sources of funding and research protocols, were too inconclusive to inform such major policy decisions as the national healthcare budget contracted under the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. It also reinforced the position of the MRC as the pre-eminent producer of medical knowledge and arbiter of best practice in the UK.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0140><p>Yet even as the MRC and other organizations consolidated the status of the RCT, controversies over human experimentation through the late 1960s and 1970s began to change the landscape of clinical research (<span id=bb0240><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0240 id=ancbb0240>Cooter, 2000, pp. 458–459</a></span>). In response to mounting critiques of risky clinical experimentation without informed consent, British hospitals set up specific committees to oversee the ethics of medical research. In 1984, one year into the MRC vitamin study, the Department of Health established Local Research Ethics Committees with the aim of enhancing protections for subjects based on the principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 of the World Medical Association (WMA) (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0400 id=bb0400>Hazelgrove, 2002</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0410 id=bb0410>Hedgecoe, 2009</a>). Amendments to the Helsinki code at the WMA assembly in 1975, the first of eight subsequent revisions to date, placed particular emphasis on tightening definitions of informed consent (<span id=bb0350><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0350 id=ancbb0350>Faulder, 1985, pp. 48–49</a></span>). MRC policy on informed consent in the 1980s had been laid down in a 1964 statement on ‘Responsibility in Investigations on Human Subjects’, long regarded as the authoritative guide for clinical research in the UK. This distinguished between procedures of ‘benefit to the individual’ and those ‘undertaken either on patients or on healthy subjects solely for the purpose of contributing to medical knowledge’. Investigators were required to obtain ‘explicit’ written consent in the latter case but not the former, since experimental treatments were assumed to ‘fall within the ambit of patient-care’ (<span id=bb0600><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0600 id=ancbb0600>MRC, 1964, p. 178</a></span>).</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0145><p>Through the 1980s and 1990s, new procedures for the oversight of the profession emerged alongside rising appeals for lay involvement in the administration of clinical research in the form of patient activists and advocates, consumer groups and the independent discipline of bioethics (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0290 id=bb0290>Dawes, 2012</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0335 id=bb0335>Epstein, 1996</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0915 id=bb0915>Wilson, 2012</a>).

Meanwhile, tighter regulation of drugs testing in both the UK and the US, along with increasing demands for larger trials to ensure greater statistical confidence in the results encouraged the ‘outsourcing’ of clinical research, especially to middle- and low-income countries from the 1980s (<span id=bb0655><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0655 id=ancbb0655>Petryna, 2009</a></span>).

From the outset the MRC was sensitive to the ethical implications of enrolling women who had previously had an NTD baby and were planning another pregnancy into a controlled trial. This would mean randomly allocating subjects into one of three control groups: the first to take a daily Pregnavite multivitamin, the second a 5-milligram dose of folic acid, and the third a placebo. Where mandatory AFP testing and amniocentesis indicated a fetal NTD, women would be offered an abortion. The steering committee initially spoke of recruiting a minimum of 2000 and as many as 5000 participants over three years, but asserted that the trial would be terminated as soon as there was statistically significant evidence of a ‘very marked’ reduction in NTDs in either arm of the study (National Archives, MRC press release; Report to the Systems Board FD23/5152). Criticisms of the proposals surfaced immediately, with some experts invited to comment on the trial design arguing that it would be ‘unacceptable to withhold a harmless, and possibly beneficial, treatment from women who had presented for treatment.’<span id=bfn10><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn10 id=ancbfn10><sup>10</sup></a></span> John Davis, the Cambridge professor of paediatrics appointed to chair the MRC study group, was soon ‘bombarded’ with letters from medical colleagues critical of plans to include a placebo group (<span id=bb0280><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0280 id=ancbb0280>Davis, 1982d</a></span>).</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0155><p>The debate spilled into public view early in 1982 as journalists picked up on expert disagreement over the feasibility and ethics of a placebo-controlled trial.

The most stringent opposition came from clinicians concerned that they could not subject women to the risk of a placebo without violating ordinary responsibilities of patient care, not least because vitamins, including folic acid, were already so widely recommended in pregnancy.

The extension of the debate beyond the medical press not only raised the stakes for the researchers, but also brought a range of new participants’ differing perceptions of risk, nutrition, motherhood and disability into conflict.</p></p><h2 class=svArticle id=s0025><ol start=5><li>Constructing pre-conceptional nutrition</h2></li></ol><p class="svArticle section" id=p0175><p>The MRC vitamin study group announced the results of the trial in 1991, claiming a ‘72% protective effect’ for folic acid in at-risk pregnancies (<span><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0605>MRC Vitamin Study Research Group, 1991</a></span>).

Moreover, claims that the statistical rigour of the trial produced definitive answers overlooked the vital role of groups other than MRC epidemiologists in tipping the balance of certainty and uncertainty. The new identity of folic acid as a risk-reducing drug depended on the agency of non-experts.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0180><p>First, the media, as discussed above, played a major part in the controversy, not merely communicating expert disagreement, but also shaping both professional and lay perceptions of risk and uncertainty. Mass media debate required that protagonists adopt a clear position on the ‘ethics’ of the trial and, thus, the efficacy of pre-conceptional vitamins in reducing the risk of NTDs. Medical researchers and practitioners used the media to declare their support or opposition to the trial and journalists intervened directly, too. The feminist health rights activist and journalist Carolyn Faulder, for instance, framed the trial as part of a patient-consumer struggle for informed consent. Condemning the MRC as an ‘implacable stony-faced god of numbers’, Faulder claimed that that vulnerable women were effectively being deceived into ‘sacrific<a class=wiki href=ing rel>ing</a>’ their children for the sake of statistical certainty (<span><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0350>1985, p. 92</a></span>). When the MRC sought to dissuade critics of the trial from expressing their concerns in public, <em>Nature</em> ran an intentionally ‘spectacular’ blank space on the editorial pages in protest at a blatant attempt to stifle professional debate (<span id=bb0870><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0870 id=ancbb0870>Veitch, 1982a</a></span>).<span id=bfn13><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn13 id=ancbfn13><sup>13</sup></a></span> More generally, newspapers produced a whole language around the trial distinct from the expert discourse. ‘Study mothers’ were recast as ‘guinea pigs’ and ‘heartbreak mums’; ‘affected pregnancies’ became ‘tragic babes’; multivitamins counted as ‘special pills’ and placebos were ‘fake ones’ ( <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0355 id=bb0355>Ferriman, 1982</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0460>King, 1982</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0730 id=bb0730>Roxan, 1982</a>, <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0855>Toulson, 1982</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0875 id=bb0875>Veitch, 1982b</a>).</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0185><p>Second, industry had a vested interest in the design and interpretation of the trial.

Beecham’s medical director had also raised concerns about the ethics of the placebo group. The MRC took this stance as a subterfuge, recognizing Beecham’s obvious interest in having the assumed effectiveness of ‘their mixture’ demonstrated by a major clinical trial and the likelihood that the supplements would be ultimately recommended to ‘the entire population of women at risk of becoming pregnant’ (<span><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0265>Davis, 1982a</a></span>).

Within months of the publication of the vitamin study in 1991, food manufacturers announced plans to fortify proprietary products with folic acid. The Kellogg Company, for instance, launched a new marketing campaign targeted at ‘women of childbearing age’, drawing on the MRC study as proof that ‘babies benefit from a healthy breakfast even before they’re conceived’.<span id=bfn14><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn14 id=ancbfn14><sup>14</sup></a></span> At precisely the time advertisers used fetal images to sell family cars (<span id=bb0825><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0825 id=ancbb0825>Taylor, 1992</a></span>), invoking the benefits of folic acid to ‘babies’ even before pregnancy helped market breakfast cereal.<span id=bfn15><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn15 id=ancbfn15><sup>15</sup></a></span> In the early 1990s, folic acid fortification became a key element in the branding of both proprietary multivitamins and processed foods, preceding official public health initiatives by some four years (<span id=bb0620><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0620 id=ancbb0620>Nestle, 2007, pp. 303–304</a></span>).<span id=bfn16><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn16 id=ancbfn16><sup>16</sup></a></span> As of 2013, pharmaceutical companies remain the main corporate sponsors of folic acid awareness campaigns, on which they rely to promote other ‘pregnancy vitamin’ combinations.<span id=bfn17><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn17 id=ancbfn17><sup>17</sup></a></span></p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0190><p>Third, charities, patient advocates and consumer groups were deeply involved in the controversy from the start, actively influencing the design of the trial. Most directly, the cooperation of the Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH) was crucial to the recruitment of research subjects. Preconditions for ASBAH endorsement were that participants would be ‘adequately briefed’ before giving their consent and that even the placebo group would receive a mineral supplement containing iron and calcium rather than a ‘dummy pill’ (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0190 id=bb0190>Bryan, 1982a</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0930 id=bb0930>Wynn, 1982</a>).<span id=bfn18><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn18 id=ancbfn18><sup>18</sup></a></span> ASBAH was part of a coalition of women’s health and disability organizations campaigning for the reform of maternity care, including the National Childbirth Trust (NCT), the Association for the Improvement of Maternity Services, the Foundation for Education and Research into Childbearing and the Maternity Alliance. Although these ‘consumer’ groups differed in their objectives and methods, by the early 1980s they came to focus much of their campaigning around reducing maternal poverty and preventing handicap (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0635>Oakley, 1984</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0935 id=bb0935>Wynn and Wynn, 1979</a>). While the MRC won the support of ASBAH by revising the trial protocols, the maternity groups remained critical, arguing that the study ignored the real problem of dietary deficiency among socio-economically disadvantaged women (<span id=bb0615><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0615 id=ancbb0615>National Childbirth Trust, 1983</a></span>). The Maternity Alliance, in particular, sought to highlight the wider issue of maternal poverty, agitating against the Thatcher Government’s cuts to the maternity budget and for the provision of free vitamins to pregnant women (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0665 id=bb0665>Phillips, 1986</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0660 id=bb0660>Phillips, 1984</a>).

The then largest ‘pro-life’ organization in the UK, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC) led the anti-abortion response from summer 1983, coordinating pickets of branches of Boots chemists, whose pharmaceutical division had supplied the multivitamin and placebo pills.<span id=bfn19><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn19 id=ancbfn19><sup>19</sup></a></span> Leaflets handed out at the pickets demanded the MRC ‘stop these immoral trials … condemned as immoral and repugnant by many organizations and doctors throughout the country’.

The crucial role of these groups in the public construction of certainty and uncertainty is essential for understanding the emerging identity of folic acid as a risk-reducing drug. Their involvement both generalized and popularized discussions on the relationship between nutritional deficiencies and NTDs, turning pre-conception vitamin supplementation into a risk-reducing strategy not only for ‘high-risk mothers’ but for all women planning a pregnancy. By organizing for and against the trial, moreover, the healthcare industry, the media and patient advocates, also helped to reify the concept of ‘pre-pregnancy’ as a legitimate focus of medical and social intervention.</p></p></div><p class="svArticle section" id=p0205><p>Immediately following the publication of the MRC study, the UK Chief Medical Officer issued a circular recommending that all women of childbearing age significantly increase their daily folate intake (<span id=bb0010><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0010 id=ancbb0010>Acheson, 1991</a></span>). In the same year, the parliamentary health committee confirmed that the expansion of ‘preconception care’ would be a key objective of maternity services reform (<span id=bb0405><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0405 id=ancbb0405>Health Committee, 1991</a></span>). Although increasingly offered within NHS hospitals by the mid-1980s, ‘pre-conception clinics’ originated as a private healthcare initiative. Largely associated with Foresight, a charity established in 1979 for the ‘promotion of pre-conceptual care’, the clinics focused on preparing women for pregnancy as a means of ‘preventing handicap’ (<span><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0635 id=ancbb0635>Oakley, 1984, p. 291</a></span>). Promoted in the media and by maternity consumer groups through the 1980s and early 1990s, Foresight has campaigned to raise awareness of ‘risks to the foetus of nutritional deficiencies’, as well as marketing their branded vitamin supplements, to help couples ‘build a better baby’ (<span id=bb0230><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0230 id=ancbb0230>Cochrane, 1983</a></span>). This innovation provoked mixed responses. Some in the medical profession saw pre-conception care as a means of helping obstetricians to ‘reduce further fetal wastage and the incidence of malformation’ (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0075 id=bb0075>Anon, 1981</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0790 id=bb0790>Smithells, 1984</a>); for others, it merely dragged ‘the medicalisation of pregnancy and birth backwards to cover conception as well’ (<span id=bb0080><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0080 id=ancbb0080>Anon, 1985, p. 1047</a></span>). British feminists took pre-pregnancy care as emblematic of the ‘moral climate’ of the 1980s, coinciding with attempts by the ‘New Right’ to reduce the legal limit of abortion, and extending social expectations around the responsibilities of motherhood to include not only pregnancy, but also the period before conception (<span id=bb0565><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0565 id=ancbb0565>McNeil, 1991, p. 151</a></span>).

As one component of the Pregnavite multivitamin, it was an ‘experimental drug’ for women at ‘high risk’ of bearing a child with an NTD. By the mid-1990s, health education materials recommended folic acid supplements to ‘all women who may bear children’. If epidemiology in the tradition of social medicine encouraged NTDs to be understood in relation to social problems of poverty and malnutrition, by the end of the century they were more likely to be attributed to individual women’s failure to respond appropriately to expert guidance. New guidelines about preconceptional and prenatal nutrition came as medical research and related advice concerning pregnancy in general, including the risks maternal drinking, smoking and drug taking posed to the fetus, proliferated in the 1980s and 1990s (<span id=bb0250><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0250 id=ancbb0250>Daniels, 1993</a></span>). At that time, a few health activists and journalists observed that the extreme focus on expectant women’s personal accountability for birth outcomes not only served to intensify both their anxieties during pregnancy and feelings of guilt about bearing a disabled baby, but also distracted attention from debate over the socioeconomic determinants of maternal and infant health (<span id=bb0455><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0455 id=ancbb0455>Kent, 1986</a></span>). Feminist scholars have since widely critiqued the “privatization of risk” in pregnancy and the exaggerated emphasis on maternal responsibility for unborn or even yet-to-be conceived fetuses that dietary guidelines have encouraged (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0530>Lupton, 2012</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0540 id=bb0540>Markens et al., 1997</a>). But demands for expectant women to engage in risk-aversive behaviours, this article suggests, did not result straightforwardly from medical professionals’ aspirations to expand the scope of obstetric control over pregnancy.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0215><p>The trajectory of folic acid from experimental drug to necessary pre-conceptional supplement was negotiated over several decades by the medical researchers, healthcare industry, the media, consumer groups and activists. Reflecting on the controversy over the MRC study in 1984, the sociologist Ann Oakley observed that ‘diet is something everyone is an expert on, and the idea that malformed fetuses can be prevented by a healthy diet … <a class=wiki href=has rel>has</a> a long history and a commonsense appeal’ (1984, p. 290). Activists’ interest in nutrition, especially of mothers and infants, both followed and supported a swathe of research across the medical and social sciences during the 1970s and 1980s. Debates over folic acid need to be placed more fully in relation to the wider politicization of food and nutrition in this period (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0620>Nestle, 2007</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0740 id=bb0740>Scrinis, 2013</a>). Medical research into folic acid was, perhaps above all, stimulated by the emergence of spina bifida as a political concern in Britain around 1970. This transformation remains poorly documented, and we need more nuanced histories of the connections between medical innovations, public health policies and ‘disability rights’ activism in a period of rapid change. By 1991 the context was entirely different; the birth prevalence of NTDs had declined significantly and spina bifida was far less visible than it had been even ten years earlier.<span id=bfn23><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#fn23 id=ancbfn23><sup>23</sup></a></span> The conclusion of the MRC study was nevertheless an important watershed in that it directly informed health policies in the UK and around the world.

Further research might also ask to what extent measures to encourage ‘pre-pregnant’ women to consume supplements have followed precedents set by rubella vaccination (<span><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0690 id=ancbb0690>Reagan, 2010</a></span>), newborn screening for phenylketonuria (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0505 id=bb0505>Lindee, 2005</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0650 id=bb0650>Paul, 1998</a>) and campaigns around smoking in pregnancy (<span id=bb0155><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0155 id=ancbb0155>Berridge & Loughlin, 2008</a></span>) and fetal alcohol syndrome (<a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0110 id=bb0110>Armstrong, 2003</a> and <a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001349#b0370 id=bb0370>Golden, 2005</a>). Like prenatal diagnosis, these innovations have contributed to the inexorable rise of the fetus in medical practice and public debate. Continuing disagreement among health policy makers over folic acid also open up further questions about varied public responses and assessments of success or failure in different national contexts. In particular, the ways in which the fate of pre-conceptional vitamin supplementation was tied to other modalities of reducing birth defects—specifically, prenatal testing and selective termination—and controversies around them demand further study. Like many recent public health innovations, folic acid was scaled up from an individual treatment for selected, high-risk individuals into a means of accomplishing population health goals. As public health experts continue to debate the risks and benefits, it nonetheless remains an experiment-in-progress.</p></p><div class="articleText svArticle"><div class=articleText_indent><h2 class="h2 secHeading" id=ack001><p>Acknowledgements</h2></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0235><p>I am grateful to Tatjana Buklijas, Laura Dawes, Nick Hopwood, David Smith and two anonymous reviewers for generous comments on this article.
