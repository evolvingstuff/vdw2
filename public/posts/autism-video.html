And I&rsquo;m going to, for the first time, deliver a lecture&mldr; regarding the epidemiology of autism, and I&rsquo;ll explain this to you. It&rsquo;s the very first time I&rsquo;ve done it. I&rsquo;ve lectured on various forms of other diseases in the past, high blood pressure, cholesterol, heart disease, kidney disease, certainly COVID and COVID vaccine injuries, but not autism. So what I want to do over the course of the next 45 minutes is give you a perspective on how to think about this problem as a complex problem. When we have complex problems in medicine, they are rarely due to one cause.</p><p>So I want to encourage you to think about a complex disease needs to be thought of in terms of having determinants or what we call risk factors. It&rsquo;s a much better term to put out there in your discussion. If you come on head on with somebody and you said, this causes this, they&rsquo;ll say, no, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p><p>describe the syndrome of high functioning autism and this kind of unique intellect. And by the way, over the period of time when doctors were making these observations, I was very interested to note that the doctors noted that many times the children were the progeny of extraordinarily intelligent parents. Isn&rsquo;t that interesting? Isn&rsquo;t that interesting?</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_14{ANAME}6:04</p><p>And when we get enough evidence, we can say a causal risk factor. But I think the word cause is just too sharp right now. I really think this whole community will be advanced if you start to use the term risk factor. They say, risk factor, no one&rsquo;s going to beat you down. Say, listen, I&rsquo;m concerned that, believe it or not, there is concern that the inflammation in the gums is a risk factor for heart disease. So we can have the conversation. If we said the gum inflammation causes heart disease, you&rsquo;d have all kinds of opposition from cardiologists. So risk factors is a nice way to think about it.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_16{ANAME}6:47</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to follow this outline, make a few points with respect to each one of these bullets. And I think this audience is certainly well aware of this asymptotic rise in a condition. It&rsquo;s well beyond just recognition alone. Remember, there&rsquo;s no blood test for autism. It&rsquo;s a clinical diagnosis. But even enhanced recognition couldn&rsquo;t account for this totally.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_20{ANAME}8:34</p><p>if we start looking in, you know, did the water supply really change that much from 2016 to 2023? Did the food supply with the kids ate, did that change that quickly? What changed so rapidly to cause this diagnosis to rise? So this idea of risk factors, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_21{ANAME}8:53</p><p>I tried to find a figure that would kind of, in a pectoral way, show this. And I put at the center genetics, because I&rsquo;ll show you some data, for sure the immune system, for sure the immune system and dysregulation of the immune system. And a big perturbation of the immune system is certainly childhood vaccines.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_22{ANAME}9:25</p><p>And then the environment. And the environment, I think, always has to be considered. Just like with coronary heart disease. Smoking is very different than cholesterol. And cholesterol is very different than diabetes. But they do come together as risk factors for coronary heart disease. And then everything around the outside is very interesting. So is the microbiome change?</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_23{ANAME}9:47</p><p>Well, Dr. Hazen is here and she makes a compelling case. In fact, many of the observations around the outside may be targets for treatment. We can&rsquo;t really change the genes. It&rsquo;s hard to change environment, but boy, there are some of the things around the outside that are potential targets. Genetic predisposition. I&rsquo;ll make some points here.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_24{ANAME}10:12</p><p>Most of the genetic risk factors described for autism reside with what&rsquo;s called common variation that is not in a lineage passed down in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive fashion, but just common genetic variation, the vast majority, the vast majority. So we can&rsquo;t really pinpoint a family lineage. Here are some of the signaling pathways</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_25{ANAME}10:42</p><p>and the genes that have been described, and they track to social behaviors, vocalization patterns, assembly of information, memory, synaptic transmission, vocal learning, and then some of the proteins that are involved. Some of these proteins are certainly related to the voltage gating of sodium and potassium and chloride</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_26{ANAME}11:10</p><p>Some of these channels are actually in the human heart as well. And then others actually have to do with the energetics of cells in the body, so-called mitochondria, the power pack in the body. But the point is, there are peer reviewed papers publishing that there is some role to be played for genetic predisposition.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_27{ANAME}11:36</p><p>Because part of this puzzle is why do some children have autism and others don&rsquo;t? And everything else is the same. Why is one child different than another? So this is part of the puzzle. How many of here have heard of MTHFR? MTHFR, okay, so very, very well-educated group. Methylene tetrahydrofolic acid reductase.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_28{ANAME}12:03</p><p>This is a key enzyme that methylates proteins in the body, and it&rsquo;s very dependent on vitamin B6, B12, and a key substance that&rsquo;s methylated is folate. And MTHFR is more common among people like me, kind of white Anglo-Irish, actually the Irish, and you can probably tell by my name. I&rsquo;m the real McCoy.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_29{ANAME}12:32</p><p>We tend to be MTHFR mutants. There are mutations, the most common mutations called the C677T mutation. Well, if we have a mutation in this methylation system, we can&rsquo;t process B6, B12, and folate well enough. And when the neurons don&rsquo;t get enough of these, they tend to be dysfunctional, and particularly during birth. This is such a huge problem.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_30{ANAME}13:07</p><p>that as a child i remember children going to elementary school who had spina bifida spina bifida you remember that you don&rsquo;t see spina bifida anymore because spina bifida was studied and it turned out that a risk factor for spina bifida not the complete cause but a risk factor was folate deficiency in the diet</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_31{ANAME}13:31</p><p>and just by supplementing the diet with folate which happened during our our generation during our childhood years spina bifida magically went away it&rsquo;s a problem of a neural a tube defect at the bottom of the spine it led to lower extremity weakness and you remember the kids because they didn&rsquo;t have any control over their</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_32{ANAME}13:55</p><p>their bladder and their bowel, particularly the bowel, and they have to wear diapers even in elementary school. I distinctly remember that. So that&rsquo;s an example of studying risk factors, coming up with a population intervention, in a sense, solving a problem with folate supplementation. Now we&rsquo;re all over it.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_33{ANAME}14:13</p><p>I mean, that&rsquo;s a bona fide advance in public health, bona fide advance. So MTHFR in the general population, because the general population is you know, heavily weighted towards Anglo white individuals is about 25% have an MTHFR mutation. However, among children with autism, it can be nearly everyone. 75, some studies 95%. So there&rsquo;s something there.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_34{ANAME}14:47</p><p>I mean, you would argue that is out of proportion. The odds ratio, the risk here in this study was 1.47. I mean, so that&rsquo;s, you know, if it&rsquo;s one, that means there&rsquo;s no relationship whatsoever. So you would agree that there&rsquo;s something there. The autistic kids are at least have a genetic predisposition that&rsquo;s different than non-autistic kids.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_35{ANAME}15:14</p><p>Preterm delivery, you&rsquo;ve heard a lot about preterm delivery. Preterm delivery is in a sense, now something that&rsquo;s well handled by modern medicine because of neonatal ICUs. How many of you in the room have had a preterm child that was in the NICU? Well, there you go. So, you know, this has been an advance in modern medicine.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_36{ANAME}15:38</p><p>When I was going to medical school, we really didn&rsquo;t have these. The prevalence of autism has been reviewed among preterm infants. And here there&rsquo;s 10,900 papers that were screened, 52 that went into the analysis. Do you know among preterm babies who are followed, the incidence or ultimately the prevalence of autism, 20%, 20%. This is very important.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_37{ANAME}16:15</p><p>Now, when there&rsquo;s detailed screening mechanisms, the studies center around 6%. But it&rsquo;s still way more than the population average. Now, that&rsquo;s delivery before 37 weeks. So you would agree for sure preterm delivery would be a risk factor. If it happens, it could put a child at risk.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_38{ANAME}16:39</p><p>Some of you have autistic kids and you had a preterm delivery for whatever reason. How about parental age? Parental age. Father greater than 40 years, mother greater than 35 years, 41 studies. The answer is yes. Older parents are more likely to have an autistic child. Odds ratio about 1.47.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_39{ANAME}17:05</p><p>So how you interpret that is there&rsquo;s a 47% excess risk or it&rsquo;s about It&rsquo;s not quite double the risk of being younger, but it&rsquo;s elevated. So it&rsquo;s a risk factor. No one should get upset about this. It&rsquo;s a risk factor. Now, if you said older parents are the cause of autism, everyone would say, wait a minute,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_40{ANAME}17:29</p><p>wait a minute, that&rsquo;s too strong. That&rsquo;s not a direct cause, but it&rsquo;s something that contributes to risk. See, it&rsquo;s helping us understand why autism is taking off we are having more older parents have children we are having more children survive preterm delivery but immune system dysregulation is a big one</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_41{ANAME}17:58</p><p>a big one and it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s so big you know it&rsquo;s on the floor of the US Senate in confirmation for Robert F. Kennedy and for Dr. J. Bhattacharya. Senators were unhinged, holding up papers, screaming that vaccines don&rsquo;t cause autism. There was this very pointed discussions. And at first I was a little</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_42{ANAME}18:27</p><p>I was a little upset that Kennedy and Bhattacharya didn&rsquo;t engage. And people were saying, well, listen, they&rsquo;re just trying to get past the confirmation side of things. And I thought about it more in preparing for this. And I&rsquo;m actually glad they didn&rsquo;t say vaccines cause autism. Because again, I think that&rsquo;s too strong of a declaration.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_43{ANAME}18:50</p><p>What they could have said is, listen, we need to study this because they appear to be a risk factor. And unlike the risk factors I&rsquo;ve presented so far, this one is modifiable. And boy, are there a lot of papers on this. Here&rsquo;s one. Journal of Autoimmunity, 2016. Risk factors in autism. Thinking outside the brain.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_44{ANAME}19:14</p><p>Immune system dysfunction in this wordogram comes to the very top of this. how is the immune system and the brain linked how are they linked it turns out our immune system has four major components to it cells like white blood cells antibodies you know about antibodies through covid cytokines cytokines are small</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_45{ANAME}19:38</p><p>protein signals and cytokines for sure penetrate the brain big time And then lastly, complement. You won&rsquo;t hear much about complement, but complement&rsquo;s the final attack sequence on an organism, a pathogen. But I can tell you cytokines, which are circulating in the body, and there are hundreds, if not thousands of them,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_46{ANAME}20:00</p><p>are the communication signals between white blood cells and parenchymal cells, tissue cells, heart cells, brain cells, kidney cells. The cytokines you can imagine go wild when a baby receives a vaccine. And for sure when a baby receives 16 vaccines at once. It has to. And when these cytokines rage in the human body, they are responsible for fever.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_47{ANAME}20:31</p><p>They are responsible for changes in the child&rsquo;s affect. They&rsquo;re responsible for pain. And for sure, they are responsible for febrile seizures, for sure. So cytokines must play an enormously important role in the genesis of what we&rsquo;re talking about. This paper by De Los Angeles Robinson-Agramonte, I love how the people from South America just load up the names.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_48{ANAME}21:03</p><p>You can actually find her entire lineage in that name but this reviewed in this review just in summary is exhaustive has 236 references it was published in they did a search in 2023 in pubmed they found 200 papers that the immune system is involved in the development of autism for sure for sure this is not conjecture</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_49{ANAME}21:34</p><p>So something is disturbing the immune system, the cytokines go into the brain, and they do cause changes in the brain. Immune system dysfunction is on the storyboard for the development of autism. I don&rsquo;t think doctors 80 years ago were thinking about the immune system, although they may have, and I&rsquo;ll show you a case example. Febrile seizures.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_50{ANAME}22:04</p><p>Febrile seizures for sure occur in children and result in neurologic damage. This is very important. Here&rsquo;s a paper by Gilbert. In Europe, they have a definition called essence. Essence includes tics, seizures, motor disorders, autism spectrum disorder so it&rsquo;s a grouping attention deficit disorder that&rsquo;s called the essence disorders there is a significant association between febrile</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_51{ANAME}22:39</p><p>seizures and the development of autism if a child develops a febrile seizure of any cause because a febrile seizure is due to cytokines going in the brain well what could cause a febrile seizure influenza could strep throat could an ear infection could, a gastroenteritis could. About three to 4% of children per year have a febrile seizure.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_52{ANAME}23:09</p><p>So febrile seizures are part of this. Parents may observe them. You may not. The baby may be in the bassinet and you may not know. A febrile seizure could lead, if you don&rsquo;t witness it, could lead to sudden infant death. and then finding the baby dead in the crib.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_53{ANAME}23:33</p><p>But febrile seizures, when Tracy first asked me, I said, I want to lecture on febrile seizures. It&rsquo;s so important because parents need to have this awareness about febrile seizures. Then I said, no, no, no. That&rsquo;s part of a bigger story here. But the evidence here is compelling. Do vaccines cause febrile seizures? For sure.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_54{ANAME}23:54</p><p>For sure, this is a paper from our US CDC, from the public access database. For sure they do. They list these cases. They occur with combination vaccines. They can occur with single vaccines, but they&rsquo;re far more likely to occur with combination vaccines because the child is trying to manage multiple, you know, either killed, live attenuated,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_55{ANAME}24:19</p><p>or antigen vaccines all at once, and the cytokines are being raised in the baby&rsquo;s body. But for sure, vaccines cause febrile seizures. Now, the debate is how much of the 3% to 4% of febrile seizures is caused by vaccines. There&rsquo;s not a good source of information for that because obviously there can be other causes.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_56{ANAME}24:41</p><p>But when you think about the intensity and frequency of vaccination, chances are vaccination, in terms of a population attributable risk, are a giant risk for febrile seizures in children. How many of you, your child, had a febrile seizure? Probably about 10%. 10%, very, very scary. This paper, very important. I quote this paper a lot.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_57{ANAME}25:07</p><p>Nielsen and colleagues from Europe, when a febrile seizure occurs when a febrile seizure occurs there&rsquo;s a 41 chance the child develops one of these essence syndromes when followed over time 41 a tick epilepsy attention deficit disorder autism they didn&rsquo;t have it at birth They got sick, they had a febrile seizure of whatever cause,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_58{ANAME}25:38</p><p>and now there&rsquo;s a 41% chance the child neurologically is changed forever. So febrile seizures are a big teaching point. My son&rsquo;s an ER resident right now. I was talking to him about the other day. I said, what do you tell parents about risk of febrile seizures and what do they do about it?</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_59{ANAME}25:56</p><p>He says, well, you know, we do dual use of Tylenol and ibuprofen. He said, you better believe it. We&rsquo;re talking, we need fever control because the fever itself is part of the determination for the seizure. And part of it is not related mathematically to the temperature.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_60{ANAME}26:13</p><p>but we need to get control over inflammation in the body of whatever cause. We would not want a child to just be rocking at 105 and have a seizure from any cause. It&rsquo;s gonna end up, this is a very, very important study. So now you can start to do the math.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_61{ANAME}26:30</p><p>Three to 4% of the population per year of children have a febrile seizure, If they have a febrile seizure, there&rsquo;s a 41% chance they could end up with one of these disorders, autism being a big one. Now we&rsquo;re starting to get to a one to 2% rate of autism. Now it&rsquo;s starting to epidemiologically fit together.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_62{ANAME}26:52</p><p>Where are we with vaccination? You probably had a lot of lectures on this. This paper was just published last month. How do vaccines, there&rsquo;s the word, cause autism? How can Bill Kennedy or Maggie Hassan or Bernie Sanders get up there and say, it&rsquo;s conclusive, the answer is in, vaccines don&rsquo;t cause autism,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_63{ANAME}27:17</p><p>when there&rsquo;s papers being published saying just the opposite in the peer-reviewed literature? There must be an opportunity for discussion or debate or deliberation. There are always two points of view. There are always two points of view. Always be leery of any attorney or senator or congressman asking a question where the predicate to this is a long assertion.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_64{ANAME}27:46</p><p>They are making an assertion and then it&rsquo;s down to, doctor, don&rsquo;t you agree? Or doctor, this is yes and no. That is a method by which attorneys manipulate the witness. Senator Cassidy, Senator Hassan, and Senator Sanders were intentionally manipulating Robert F. Kennedy and Jay Bhattacharya, and I think to some degree, Marty Macri.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_65{ANAME}28:20</p><p>We should never have our employees in Washington, which they are, they work for us, be manipulating witnesses in an advice and consent process. I&rsquo;ve testified in Washington multiple times, and I&rsquo;ve been an expert witness many, many times, including cases that have gone to Supreme Court.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_66{ANAME}28:37</p><p>And I usually let that go on, the assertions go on for a long time. And say something like, Senator, this is my hearing, isn&rsquo;t it? Not yours? I&rsquo;m the expert witness. I&rsquo;m under oath. You&rsquo;re not. Something like that. They have to be reminded who is doing what. Whenever you see a long assertion, immediately think witness manipulation.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_67{ANAME}29:01</p><p>But this paper says, listen, immune system dysregulation right there up front, and it summarizes historical points. One of the historical points in this whole story is back to Leo Kanner. Leo Kanner summarized in 1944 he summarized 11 children he characterized the initial cases of autism but case three was a child who had gotten the smallpox vaccine.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_68{ANAME}29:36</p><p>Remember, the MMR didn&rsquo;t exist back then. The child had gotten the smallpox vaccine, had gotten a fever, and then it had a week of GI symptoms, gastroenteritis-type symptoms. So there&rsquo;s the GI tract connected again. And then over the next few months or a year or so, the mother who he describes as being obsessive,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_69{ANAME}29:58</p><p>keeping notes about her child, describes classic autism. So there it is, right there. Now, Kanner wasn&rsquo;t debunked. Kanner wasn&rsquo;t castigated. As far as I know, he didn&rsquo;t lose his license. He&rsquo;s just reporting what he observed. Well, that&rsquo;s what Andrew Wakefield did. He just reported what he observed. It&rsquo;s just an observation.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_70{ANAME}30:30</p><p>This paper stood as a valid paper in the medical literature for over a decade. And then there was relentless pressure to have this paper retracted, relentless, from the pharmaceutical and vaccine industry. relentless pursuit of Wakefield. He had to be destroyed by the biopharmaceutical complex. He was too credible. He was too articulate. And he was too right.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_71{ANAME}31:08</p><p>The early observations, the seminal observations are always discredited. This had to happen. You know, the very first observation of doctors washing their hands to prevent infections when they went from woman to woman doing pelvic exams, no rubber gloves back then, that was the mid 19th century was Ignaz Simmelweis in Austria, Germany. He did a study.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_72{ANAME}31:35</p><p>He started washing their hands with coronated Lyme. The infection rates plummeted. The women survived. He presented his research. He had to be wrong. He had to be discredited. All his papers had to be trashed. He had to be stripped of his professorship. He had to be stripped of his hospital privileges.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_73{ANAME}31:56</p><p>Ignaz Simmelweis had to be destroyed because these doctors could not be viewed as spreading infection from women to women with their hands and resulting in death. He died in an insane asylum 20 years later. Then about 20, 25 years later, Lindner and others came along and said, you know what? Yeah, we should have been washing our hands.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_74{ANAME}32:26</p><p>The initial observations are always castigated. Sir Austin Bradford Hill, 1949, presents to the Medical Research Council. Smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, convincingly. No, no, this can&rsquo;t be right. Doctors are smoking. Nurses are smoking. Doctors are advertising cigarettes. Doctors are smoking on rounds in the operating room. They&rsquo;re giving out cigarettes to our soldiers.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_75{ANAME}32:54</p><p>Smoking cannot cause lung cancer. Even though the smoke is black, the cancers come out, they look like they&rsquo;re black. In The Emperor of All Maladies, a book written by Mukherjee, who&rsquo;s a great read. It&rsquo;s one of the few books, he won the Pulitzer Prize on his first book. He&rsquo;s a Dana-Farber hematology oncology fellow at the time.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_76{ANAME}33:15</p><p>He writes about the lead surgeon at Johns Hopkins, who&rsquo;s taking out lung cancers and smoking all the time, teaching the junior doctors. No, smoking can&rsquo;t cause lung cancer. And there he is smoking and pulling out these cancers. He himself dies of lung cancer and doesn&rsquo;t admit that lung cancer causes smoking. So 1949, the data are in.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_77{ANAME}33:43</p><p>Smoking&rsquo;s a risk factor for lung cancer. Complete denial by the medical community. 1943, Luther Terry, Surgeon General, a real Surgeon General, carefully studies this, concludes smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other problems, calls all the major chiefs of medicine to Washington for a meeting. You should see that film. These chiefs of medicine, Mayo Clinic,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_78{ANAME}34:11</p><p>Harvard, Yale, Duke, they are green, they are nauseating, they are sweaty. when he presents the data said, we are dead wrong on this. We&rsquo;ve been wrong for decades on smoking. It was a shockwave in medicine, a shockwave. And it still doesn&rsquo;t die out. You remember 1970, half the population smoked. People still smoked on airplanes.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_79{ANAME}34:39</p><p>People smoked in the halls of Congress. It wasn&rsquo;t until the 1990s where we had the tobacco settlement. Here we are. This paper was published in 1998. And sure enough, look where we are now, about 25 years later. We&rsquo;re right on schedule for the Great Awakening. People woke up. Yeah, people woke up. People woke up.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_80{ANAME}35:11</p><p>about 20 years later on hand washing and smoking, and now they&rsquo;re waking up about 20 years later on vaccines from this seminal observation. I use the word seminal. Seminal means the discovery. See, Cantor reported it in one of 11 children, but he didn&rsquo;t put two and two together. He just was carefully reporting the news. Wakefield said, listen,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_81{ANAME}35:37</p><p>It looks like these are related. This was the MMR vaccine in the children developing autism with some GI disturbance, lymphoid hyperplasia. Didn&rsquo;t say cause. People asked him later on, he said, maybe we should split them up or separate them or delay them. But no, he had to be Do you know this week in JAMA,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_82{ANAME}36:04</p><p>one of our major medical journals, it was a paper lamenting vaccine hesitancy. They went right back to Wakefield. They cite Wakefield in this paper. He&rsquo;s in Austin, Texas, alive and well. But this is important to know. To this day, Andrew Wakefield must be positioned as the sacrificial lamb in this entire propagandized war that we&rsquo;re in.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_83{ANAME}36:39</p><p>Why would his name still be brought up? Then they said, oh, the debunked, the discredited Andrew Wakefield. Well, if he&rsquo;s that debunked and decredited, why is he continuing to be brought up in the medical literature over and over and over again? Because he made a seminal observation. That&rsquo;s the reason why. This paper, Gail DeLong,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_84{ANAME}37:05</p><p>is one of probably a dozen or so papers that started to put it together. This has a large sample size for the time it was published in the early 1990s. The point of this paper is it wasn&rsquo;t really until we got to multiple combinations of vaccines.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_85{ANAME}37:24</p><p>This is a survey of 30,000 households, okay, and they really had the data here. Once we got to children getting four doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, three doses of polio, one dose of any measles vaccine, three doses of influenza B, and three doses of hepatitis B, that&rsquo;s when we started to see these risks really,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_86{ANAME}37:49</p><p>really take off. So the Geelong paper is the one that says, listen, chances are it&rsquo;s not any single product or any single ingredient in any single product it&rsquo;s just piling on the combinations now there are plenty of papers that have tried to drill down and say you know is it aluminum or is it thiomerisol but</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_87{ANAME}38:13</p><p>this we we can&rsquo;t get away from the idea that there is a combination of products given all at once And the manufacturers, just as the last presentation have said, have kind of played games with minimum concentrations of adjuvants, what have you. And remember, it&rsquo;s not just autism that&rsquo;s taking off,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_88{ANAME}38:32</p><p>but it&rsquo;s also peanut allergies and food allergies and atopic diseases. And it raises the issue of what&rsquo;s in these that could be stimulating these allergies, including trace peanut, peanut oil. But it&rsquo;s not as if there are no papers written on this. If you said, listen, I&rsquo;m concerned about aluminum in vaccines,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_89{ANAME}38:55</p><p>it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;re pulling it out of nowhere. It&rsquo;s in the peer-reviewed literature. The same thing with thiomericil. There have been efforts to actually try to tabulate how much aluminum actually accrues in the body. different story but also great concern there&rsquo;s concern about both fluoride in the</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_90{ANAME}39:15</p><p>water supply and in my view to a greater degree aluminum in the water supply a lot of people don&rsquo;t know about this fluoride in the water supply related to lower iq in children when it&rsquo;s above certain thresholds we&rsquo;ve actually had an hhx toxicology meeting on that in 2016 published but we even have better data,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_91{ANAME}39:37</p><p>prospective cohort data on aluminum concentration in the water and risk of dementia later on. It comes from a large prospective cohort study in France. And if you think we have a all hands on deck kind of emergency with childhood autism, we also have an emergency with adult Alzheimer&rsquo;s and dementia.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_92{ANAME}40:03</p><p>My dad died of dementia, I know that very well. This is the most recent paper of many, but it&rsquo;s worth citing. If you&rsquo;re gonna say, well, doctor, what evidence do you have that vaccines could be a risk factor for autism? I&rsquo;d say this one, Mohsen and Jacob, 49,000 children who are Medicaid recipients in Florida, huge sample size.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_93{ANAME}40:30</p><p>They sample at age nine years and they ask the question, automated data, do they have autism or these other neurologic disorders, what the Europeans would call the essence disorders. And then they go back and see how many Medicaid visits did they have for vaccination. And Medicaid has codification for this.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_94{ANAME}40:50</p><p>So they have a group that had no Medicaid visits for vaccination. This is interesting. This is pretty contemporary data. Do you know what percent of children in Florida have had no Medicaid visits for vaccination? 10%. 10%. 90% have had visits. So it&rsquo;s an opportunity to have a vaccinated versus unvaccinated comparison. It&rsquo;s an opportunity. Now,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_95{ANAME}41:18</p><p>it doesn&rsquo;t mean this unvaccinated group didn&rsquo;t get any shots because they could have gone to a school vaccination campaign or vaccines in the church, and there&rsquo;s no Medicaid record of that. All the prior studies that people have claimed, particularly from Scandinavia, that vaccines are not associated with autism, they never have a clean control group.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_96{ANAME}41:42</p><p>And this doesn&rsquo;t have a clean control group either, but you can see there&rsquo;s orange and blue. I can tell you the orange are the vaccinated. So vaccines were clearly associated with the development of autism, clearly. And the more shots they took, the greater the risk of autism. So it was internally consistent. The more Medicaid visits for vaccination,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_97{ANAME}42:08</p><p>This is just one of now probably a dozen of these. So when Cassidy says, there&rsquo;s no evidence, he&rsquo;s completely incorrect that we have evidence to weigh, just like I&rsquo;m weighing it now. We can never allow, he&rsquo;s a doctor. He&rsquo;s a doctor. That&rsquo;s unacceptable to have someone like that in Washington not be fair, balanced about the data.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_98{ANAME}42:33</p><p>It&rsquo;s never case closed. It&rsquo;s never science is settled. Those are incorrect statements because the data are evolving. We know certainly the vaccine schedule is evolving. When you have two things going up, the vaccine schedule&rsquo;s going up, autism&rsquo;s going up, you don&rsquo;t go back 20 years ago and say, oh, case closed, Institute of Medicine, case closed.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_99{ANAME}42:56</p><p>No, it&rsquo;s an emerging story. Here&rsquo;s the schedule. Now, people always get this. I was born in 1962, so there were three shots. I got them, and it covered a total of five diseases. That&rsquo;s legit. When we get to 2024, there&rsquo;s confusion on the number. You&rsquo;ve heard 72. One time I used 108. Here, this is 88.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_100{ANAME}43:19</p><p>Why is there confusion? Because there&rsquo;s confusion on how many COVID vaccine shots are in the schedule for kids. There&rsquo;s confusion there. about do you get caught up do you not get caught up so it&rsquo;s somewhere between 88 and i think 113 i think is the number depending on how many covid shots this</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_101{ANAME}43:38</p><p>schedule just gives one covid shot so uh it could be higher Now, I&rsquo;ve said on TV, and you&rsquo;ve heard me mention this about this compound vaccination, and I said a child receives a battery around age one, you know, age nine to 15 months. And I was accused by a pediatrician of exaggerating this,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_102{ANAME}44:02</p><p>that the kids don&rsquo;t get this much together. So I took the schedule and I counted up every single thing a child is given during this timeframe. The answer is 16. Now they&rsquo;re given in combination products, so it may seem not be 16 shots, but they are getting 16 three things conceivably all at the same time.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_103{ANAME}44:23</p><p>Recently, Children&rsquo;s Health Defense reported a poor baby who was getting caught up. Did you see that case? And that was it, probably 16 and that was it. It&rsquo;s right around this timeframe that sudden infant death syndrome occurs. 78% of this occurs within a week of a big battery. 50% occur within 48 hours.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_104{ANAME}44:51</p><p>Sudden infant death syndrome is tightly, temporally related to getting a big battery of vaccines. Very related. It&rsquo;s so related that Beryl Hammady, a representative in Louisiana, pushed forward legislation that all children who die, sudden infant death syndrome, a healthy baby dies under the age of one,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_105{ANAME}45:16</p><p>that that child get reviewed for when they got their vaccines at the time of autopsy, because they all have to get autopsies. Do you know that the coroners of Louisiana said, no, we don&rsquo;t want to see the vaccine record? Why would a doctor doing an investigation into death not want to view information? They know. They know.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_106{ANAME}45:43</p><p>The reason why this whole thing is understudied, everybody, is they know. There&rsquo;s no reason why. Hamaday was helping the coroners. He was helping the medical examiners to mandate this information come forward. They did not want to see it. In fact, they lobbied the representatives not to approve that legislation.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_107{ANAME}46:05</p><p>Bury their heads in the sand in the state of Louisiana. Well, now the panel, the CDC ACIP panel, which has been suspended by Robert F. Kennedy, they added the COVID vaccines to the childhood schedule. Under emergency use authorization, no testing for teratogenicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, no safety. studies over any duration of time.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_108{ANAME}46:36</p><p>No large prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. No medical indication and no clinical necessity. Nothing. This was the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. Confidence in the entire vaccine schedule is plummeting and it&rsquo;s because of this, for sure. We&rsquo;re at about 10% of parents now walking away saying, I&rsquo;ve had enough. I&rsquo;ve had enough.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_109{ANAME}47:07</p><p>There&rsquo;s even one paper in a preclinical model where the COVID vaccines have been linked to autistic changes. Again, probably the commonality of cytokines going in the brain in animals. World Council for Health says, and this is 2023, they&rsquo;ve seen enough. Now, this is an evidence-based, physician-led, consensus-driven organization. This is essentially like the CDC.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_110{ANAME}47:35</p><p>It&rsquo;s just another CDC or another WHO. Look what they say. A common sense approach now is needed. If you need an organization to have back you up on this in a state like California, you could use this and say, listen, they are urged to wait on all vaccines. Just wait. So some principles of vaccines are{ANAME()}transcription_111{ANAME} – – – is that they&rsquo;re much safer when they&rsquo;re given as individual shots and not all together. You think I&rsquo;ve made the case there. And they&rsquo;re much safer when they&rsquo;re given later. And from a population perspective, they&rsquo;re probably much safer if they&rsquo;re not given to everyone, if they&rsquo;re given based upon risk when we get down to medical necessity and the {ANAME()}transcription_112{ANAME}clinical indication. It can&rsquo;t be one size fits all. As a medical doctor, I don&rsquo;t prescribe the same drug to every single patient in my clinic. I can&rsquo;t. If I gave 16 drugs to the same person at the same time, even though each individual drug would have been reasonably safe,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_113{ANAME}48:44</p><p>all 16 together almost certainly are not going to be safe. The world of vaccinology essentially has gone off the rails. I think a lot of good intention now is leading to harm. So to finish and conclude, epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of disease. Autism spectrum disorder is amenable to epidemiologic investigation of risk factors.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_114{ANAME}49:09</p><p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done today. Genetic predisposition is up on the board. Older age of parents, preterm delivery before 37 weeks, and immune system dysregulation as a potential trigger. For sure, febrile seizures of any cause. And then the combination cumulative early childhood vaccination. So I would submit to you,{ANAME()}transcription_115{ANAME} the combination vaccination appears to be a risk factor or a trigger for the development of autism, but not the exclusive cause. And I think for those in the audience who are taking up the charge on vaccine safety as I am, I think we&rsquo;re going to go a lot farther in Washington and a lot farther with our {ANAME()}transcription_116{ANAME}pediatricians and medical doctors if we start thinking and using the term risk factor instead of exclusive cause, because it&rsquo;s virtually impossible for someone to say, no, it&rsquo;s not a risk factor, because we have the evidence there. When we have risk factors, now we can discuss them. Clearly, large-scale prospective cohort studies, vaccinated versus unvaccinated, are warranted.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_117{ANAME}50:17</p><p>There&rsquo;s plenty of people who want their children to take vaccines. So they&rsquo;re available for study. There&rsquo;s plenty of people who don&rsquo;t want their kids to take any vaccines. So now we have an opportunity to actually do detailed measurements, neuropsychiatric exams at baseline, and then let the vaccination or non-vaccination occur and do follow-up assessments. That&rsquo;s prospective cohort.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_118{ANAME}50:41</p><p>This problem is so big, it warrants that. We&rsquo;ve had that with cholesterol. We&rsquo;ve had that with blood pressure. We&rsquo;ve had it for diabetic control. The only risk factor for heart disease that we didn&rsquo;t have that was smoking. So smoking was still largely observational. But now&rsquo;s the time to push for this. Now, Robert F. {ANAME()}transcription_119{ANAME}Kennedy has said that there&rsquo;s gonna be an investigation into the cause of autism, and the answer is gonna be delivered September 2nd of 2025. So you wonder what type of investigation can be delivered on time. I submit to you just a conjecture, and it&rsquo;s gonna be one of two things. It&rsquo;s either gonna be, {ANAME()}transcription_120{ANAME} – – – we have kind of the McCullen analysis. And the answer is it&rsquo;s a risk factor. It&rsquo;s already there. We&rsquo;re just gonna package it up like a surgeon&rsquo;s general report. Or I think much darker, it&rsquo;s gonna be, oh, there&rsquo;s nothing to see here. It&rsquo;s going to be one of those two things because it&rsquo;s too short of a time to {ANAME()}transcription_121{ANAME}actually do any research study. It is only going to be a review of what&rsquo;s out there. So stay tuned over the next few weeks or months. I&rsquo;m Dr. Peter McCullough. Thank you so much for having me. Now, am I going to take some questions?</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_122{ANAME}52:02</p><p>Yeah, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Absolutely fantastic as always. Yes, we&rsquo;re going to take time because that&rsquo;s great or what? Yes. Yeah. So I&rsquo;m loving the work. I know we&rsquo;re going to start with a performance in a minute,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_123{ANAME}52:15</p><p>but I&rsquo;m just going to make a call because this is a rare opportunity to have such a distinguished epidemiologist here on our stage. So we&rsquo;ll take maybe two or three questions. We have a mic around here. If anyone has questions for Dr. I&rsquo;ve got a mic right here. Raise your hand. Any questions, guys? One right over here.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_124{ANAME}52:33</p><p>All right.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_125{ANAME}52:38</p><p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Katie Sweeney. I&rsquo;m from New York City. I have a question regarding the preterm labor or preterm delivery and the correlation or association with autism and essence disorders. Do you think there&rsquo;s also a factor involved with preterm births? The vaccine schedule is followed regardless of gestational age.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_126{ANAME}53:07</p><p>yeah yeah so a couple of points there is um vaccinations started in pregnant women around 2003 so it&rsquo;s pretty new never was done my wife had our kids decades before that no vaccines for my wife how many of you women in the have took vaccines during pregnancy anybody some of you younger younger women yeah</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_127{ANAME}53:32</p><p>So vaccines during pregnancy. So do vaccines cause premature labor? Well, the single greatest stimulus for premature labor is inflammation and cytokines. So of course they do. Every vaccine does. It says right in the package sensor for influenza may cause preterm labor. So anytime a woman is approached</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_128{ANAME}53:58</p><p>anytime a woman is approached with vaccines during pregnancy the risk is going to be against the disease and versus preterm delivery now a fever of another cause can trigger premature delivery believe it or not bad gum disease and bad dentition is a risk factor so there&rsquo;s been randomized trials actually of using xylitol gum it&rsquo;s really fantastic</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_129{ANAME}54:25</p><p>reduces premature labor just by that mechanism. So the point is to the question, could vaccines in pregnant women be triggering premature delivery and that actually be, you know, confluent with development autism, it&rsquo;s possible. The other thing that happens is the children who are born prematurely, the vaccines are accelerated in the hospital. So they&rsquo;re actually,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_130{ANAME}54:52</p><p>instead of giving on time, they figure, well, they&rsquo;re still in the NICU, let&rsquo;s go ahead and vaccinate them. Well, you know, there&rsquo;s been a recent report in the medical literature on this, you probably saw it, of this, well, let&rsquo;s just vaccinate them versus let&rsquo;s hold back and let them mature a little bit.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_131{ANAME}55:09</p><p>And it turned out that children who are vaccinated in the neonatal ICU, they had more apnea spells. This is very important. They had apnea spells. What do the nurses do in NICU when the children have apnea? They shake them. They get them to breathe.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_132{ANAME}55:24</p><p>Well, what happens when they have apnea at home in the cradle and you&rsquo;re not there? They stop, since they stop breathing. So that paper was an important hint that that&rsquo;s another piece to the puzzle. It&rsquo;s prematurity and early vaccination. Where are we at with questions?</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_133{ANAME}55:40</p><p>We got one over here, I believe.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_134{ANAME}55:42</p><p>Very good question. Thank you. Hi, Dr. McCullough. Dr. Ryan Cole, your friend. I&rsquo;m curious if you&rsquo;ve looked into any of the work by Dr. William Parker. He was at Duke who was funded by Johnson & Johnson until he looked at the work or the effects of acetaminophen as a potential causal effect.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_135{ANAME}56:03</p><p>And the correlation is just about as strong as vaccines. There have been some papers recently out of Europe that tried to counter it, but it&rsquo;s not a great study, even though it was a big study. So autism, the glutathione depletion, and the glutathione depletion damage neurologically,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_136{ANAME}56:21</p><p>it&rsquo;s an epidemiologic area I think it would be very interesting for you to either look into or comment on if you&rsquo;ve looked at some of that literature already. Thank you. I tend to consider the relationship of acetaminophen to all this is what&rsquo;s called confounded by indication. Why are the parents giving acetaminophen?</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_137{ANAME}56:41</p><p>Because the kids are sick with a fever. So it&rsquo;s probably not the acetaminophen that&rsquo;s the cause, but it&rsquo;s the cytokines and the sickness. It&rsquo;s called confounded by indication. We see that a lot in medicine. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if research emerges with ibuprofen and naproxen. as well there&rsquo;s only one syndrome that&rsquo;s probably related to an antipyretic it&rsquo;s</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_138{ANAME}57:04</p><p>called rise syndrome and that&rsquo;s use of aspirin remember when we give acetaminophen acetaminophen in doses that actually duplique glutathione that&rsquo;s in acetaminophen overdose where a child has taken a whole bottle of of tylenol so I wouldn&rsquo;t be dissuaded as a parent or a grandparent in using acetaminophen, probably in combination with ibuprofen, in getting that fever under control.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_139{ANAME}57:29</p><p>Okay, next question. One more. One more. We&rsquo;ve got time for one more right here. Up front.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_140{ANAME}57:37</p><p>Oh, so I&rsquo;m Jen Kozak, Healing Without Hurting, Oxford, Connecticut. So this question, besides the seizure activity, very common, I would think, is the night terrors. So that comes on after a DTAP vaccine. I remember, like, doing the timeline back and waking up in the middle of the night, and they would tell me, oh,{ANAME()}transcription_141{ANAME} it&rsquo;s normal preemie behavior to have, you know, these night terrors, which now I understand is brain inflammation. And, you know, I should have been giving&mldr; some kind of anti-inflammatory but nobody was telling me to do that either so i didn&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s the difference between the two a febrile seizure in a night terror</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_142{ANAME}58:11</p><p>yeah i mean just because you know we did the you know the mris we do all the things and we find out that yes he did have some like nighttime seizure activity left temporal lobe that whole thing but then i&rsquo;m just wondering what the correlation is</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_143{ANAME}58:23</p><p>with yeah i&rsquo;m not expert enough to know but i think it&rsquo;s a very intriguing question um how many of you who have experience with autism do the autistic children have sleep disturbance of any type? Yeah. So again, it speaks to this idea. How many of you with autistic children,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_144{ANAME}58:41</p><p>do your children have night sweats where you find the sheets sweating? Yeah. So it speaks to this idea that maybe there is excessive cytokine activation and neurologic system activation or damage going on. I think it&rsquo;s an important observation. This is the reason why autism needs to be studied. There needs to be major research grants, detailed parental surveys,</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_145{ANAME}59:07</p><p>examinations, blood tests, urine tests, imaging. It is grossly understudied. Out of all the childhood conditions, it&rsquo;s grossly understudied. I think because of a willful blindness of what would be found if it was studied.</p><p>{ANAME()}transcription_146{ANAME}59:25</p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382325"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382325",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382325"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382325"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382325"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382325"></script></body></html>
