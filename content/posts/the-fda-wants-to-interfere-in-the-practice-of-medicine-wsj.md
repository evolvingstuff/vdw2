* "A little-noticed provision of the omnibus spending bill could give the agency power to ban off-label use of approved therapies."

* "Secreted within the 2023 omnibus appropriations bill—4,155 pages, spending $1.7 trillion—is a 19-line section that could change the way medicine is practiced."

 **The information is also covered in a substack by [merylnass](https://merylnass.substack.com/p/the-fda-succeeded-in-interfering?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** 

* "The law that allowed for the use of off-label licensed drugs like HCQ and IVM appears to have been neutered.
