# Osteoporosis Medicines: What You Need to Know

Although  there is no cure for osteoporosis, there are steps you can  take to  prevent, slow or stop its progress. In some cases, you may even  be able  to improve bone density and reverse the disorder to some  degree.   Getting enough calcium and <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span> as well as appropriate  exercise  are essential to the bone health of everyone. This includes  people  treated with an osteoporosis medicine.

## Medicines for Prevention and Treatment

To  prevent and treat osteoporosis, the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)  has approved medicines to reduce the risk of broken bones. These   medicines either (1) slow or stop bone loss or (2) rebuild bone. They   are approved for postmenopausal women and men and for people with   osteoporosis due to taking steroid medicines.

The best way to  find out if you have osteoporosis is with a bone  density test by a DXA  machine. DXA stands for dual energy x-ray  absorptiometry. The T-score  result on a bone density test falls into  three categories: normal  density, low density (sometimes called  osteopenia) and osteoporosis. The  chart on Bone Density Testing  indicates when you should speak  with your doctor or other healthcare  provider about possible treatment  with an osteoporosis medicine.

If your DXA shows that you have  low bone density, your healthcare  provider will also do a FRAX test.  FRAX uses your bone density and  additional information about you to  predict your risk of breaking a  bone in the next ten years. Your  healthcare provider can use the FRAX  tool online. Updated and newer DXA  machines will provide your FRAX  score on your DXA report.

People  at high risk of breaking a bone should always speak with  their  healthcare provider about treatment options. Individuals at  highest risk  are those who have had previous broken bones of the spine  (vertebral  fractures) or hip. Almost all people with these types of  broken bones  need treatment for osteoporosis. People with other  fractures may also  need treatment.

Updated or newer DXA machines can provide a  report that gives  information on a person’s absolute fracture risk or  FRAX score. This  report incorporates a person’s bone density results,  age and some of  the important risk factors for broken bones to help  determine a  person’s risk of breaking a bone in the next 10 years. This  prediction  can help both healthcare providers and patients decide  whether  treatment is needed with an osteoporosis medicine.

* To help understand low bone density, NOF has presented the T-scores differently than in its clinical guidelines.

 **Special Note:** All  medicines have  potential side effects. When making a decision about  taking a medicine,  NOF encourages you to discuss your treatment options  with your  healthcare provider and to look at both the risks and benefits  of  taking or not taking a medicine. 

## Bone Remodeling Cycle

Bone  is living, growing tissue that constantly forms new bone while   replacing older bone. Bone continuously renews and changes through a   process called remodeling. The bone remodeling cycle consists of two   distinct stages: (1) bone resorption (breakdown or removal) and (2) bone   formation. During resorption, special cells (osteoclasts) on the  bone's  surface dissolve bone tissue and create small cavities. During   formation, other cells (osteoblasts) fill the cavities with new bone   tissue.

Usually, bone resorption and bone formation take place in  close  sequence and remain balanced. An imbalance in the bone remodeling  cycle  occurs with menopause and with aging in both genders, and it can  occur  with other conditions. An imbalance can result in bone loss that   eventually leads to osteoporosis and fractures.

Bisphosphonates, calcitonin, denosumab, estrogen and estrogen agonists/antagonists are  **antiresorptive**  **medicines** .   They slow the bone loss that occurs in the breakdown part of the   remodeling cycle. When people first start taking these medicines, they   stop losing bone as quickly as before, but still make new bone at the   same pace. Therefore, bone density may increase. The goal of treatment   with antiresorptive medicines is to prevent bone loss and lower the risk   of breaking bones.

Teriparatide, a form of parathyroid hormone,  is the first  osteoporosis medicine to increase the rate of bone  formation and is in a  distinct category of osteoporosis medicines called  **anabolic drugs** .  This is currently the only  osteoporosis medicine approved by the FDA  that truly rebuilds bone. The  goal of treatment with teriparatide is to  build bone and lower the risk  of breaking bones. 

 **Special Note:** Information provided here  about the FDA approved osteoporosis medicines  is intended solely for  general information and should NOT be relied upon  for any particular  diagnosis, treatment or care. This information does  not imply an  endorsement by NOF of any particular medicine or  manufacturer.

For more detailed information on the  actions, administration and  possible side effects for each of the  following medicines, please  consult the package insert, available online  and at pharmacies. 

## Antiresorptive Medicines—Bisphosphonates

###  **Alendronate Sodium or Alendronate Sodium plus <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}** 

### (Brand name Fosamax<sup>®</sup>and Fosamax Plus D™)

Alendronate  is approved for the prevention and treatment of  osteoporosis in  postmenopausal women and for the treatment of  osteoporosis in men. It  also is approved for the treatment of  glucocorticoid-induced  osteoporosis in men and women as a result of  long-term use of steroid  medicines (examples are prednisone and  cortisone).

Alendronate  reduces bone loss, increases bone density and reduces  the risk of spine,  hip and other broken bones by about 50 percent over  two to four years.

For  prevention, alendronate is taken daily as a 5 mg tablet or  weekly as a  35 mg tablet. For treatment, it is taken daily as a 10 mg  tablet or  weekly as a 70 mg tablet with or without <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}. The weekly dose with <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}contains either 2,800 IU or 5,600 IU of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}. Alendronate also is available in an oral solution taken weekly.

The  alendronate tablet needs to be taken first thing in the morning  after  waking up and on an empty stomach. It is swallowed whole with 6  to 8  ounces of plain water (no other liquid), at least 30 minutes  before  having anything to eat or drink. Patients must remain upright  (sitting,  standing or walking) during this 30-minute period. 

The oral  solution is also taken first thing in the morning on an  empty stomach.  Patients need to drink the entire bottle of solution  followed by at  least 2 ounces of plain water. After drinking the  solution, patients  must remain upright (sitting, standing or walking)  for at least 30  minutes with no food or drink during this time.

Alendronate with either 2,800 IU or 5,600 IU of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}provides another option for a source of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>. Weekly alendronate with 2,800 IU of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}is the equivalent of taking 400 IU daily, while weekly alendronate with 5,600 IU of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3{SUB}is the equivalent of taking 800 IU daily. <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>{SUB()}3 {SUB}is also called cholecalciferol.

###  **Ibandronate Sodium** 

### (Brand name Boniva<sup>®</sup>)

Ibandronate  is approved for the prevention and treatment of  osteoporosis in  postmenopausal women. Ibandronate reduces the incidence  of spine  fractures by about 50 percent over three years. Data do not  yet confirm  that ibandronate can reduce the risk of hip and other  non-spine  fractures. However, ibandronate increases bone density  substantially  throughout the skeleton.

For both prevention and treatment,  ibandronate is taken once monthly  as a 150 mg tablet. For treatment, it  is also available as an  intravenous (IV) injection of 3 mg given every  three months. Although  the FDA has approved a daily dose, it is not  available in the U.S.

Oral ibandronate should be taken on the  same day each month, first  thing in the morning after waking up and on  an empty stomach. It is  swallowed whole with 6 to 8 ounces of plain  water (no other liquid), at  least 60 minutes before having anything to  eat or drink. Patients must  remain upright (sitting, standing or  walking) during this 60-minute  period. 

A healthcare professional  administers the IV dose in a doctor’s  office or other outpatient  setting. It takes less than a minute to  inject. Patients need to have a  blood test (serum creatinine) to  confirm that kidney function is normal  prior to each IV injection.

###  **Risedronate Sodium or Risedronate Sodium with Calcium Carbonate** 

### (Brand name Actonel<sup>®</sup>and Actonel<sup>®</sup>with Calcium)

Risedronate  is approved for the prevention and treatment of  osteoporosis in  postmenopausal women and for the treatment of  osteoporosis in men. It  also is approved for the prevention and  treatment of  glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women as a  result of  long-term use of steroid medicines (examples are prednisone  and  cortisone).

Risedronate slows bone loss, increases bone density  and reduces the  risk of spine and non-spine fractures by 35 to 45  percent over three  years.

For both prevention and treatment,  risedronate is taken daily as a 5  mg tablet, weekly as a 35 mg tablet  that is available with or without  separate calcium carbonate tablets,  twice monthly as a 75 mg tablet (on  two consecutive days) or monthly as a  150 mg tablet.

The risedronate tablet needs to be taken first  thing in the morning  after waking up and on an empty stomach. It is  swallowed whole with 6  to 8 ounces of plain water (no other liquid), at  least 30 minutes  before having anything to eat or drink. Patients must  remain upright  (sitting, standing or walking) during this 30-minute  period. 

Weekly risedronate with calcium carbonate offers another  way to get  calcium. The once weekly risedronate tablet comes with six  individual  tablets that contain 500 mg of calcium in the form of calcium   carbonate. One calcium tablet is taken daily except on the day of the   week when risedronate is taken. If calcium is taken with the risedronate   tablet, it will prevent the absorption of risedronate and the desired   effect will not occur. Calcium carbonate supplements should be taken   with food to be well absorbed.

###  **Zoledronic Acid** 

### (Brand name Reclast®)

Zoledronic  acid is approved for the prevention and treatment of  osteoporosis in  postmenopausal women. It is also approved to increase  bone mass in men  with osteoporosis and for the prevention of new  clinical fractures in  patients who have recently had a low-trauma hip  fracture. In 2009, it  was approved for the prevention and treatment of  glucocorticoid-induced  osteoporosis in men and women as a result of  long-term use of steroid  medicines (examples are prednisone and  cortisone).

Zoledronic  acid is given once a year as an intravenous (IV) infusion  to treat  osteoporosis. It is also given every two years as an IV  infusion to  prevent osteoporosis. Although the FDA approved zoledronic  acid in 2007  to treat osteoporosis, the medicine was already available  under the name  Zometa<sup>®</sup>for use in cancer patients with certain bone conditions. The FDA first approved zoledronic acid as Zometa<sup>®</sup>in 2001.

Zoledronic  acid increases bone density and reduces fractures in the  hip, spine and  non-spine areas (such as the wrists and arms). In one  major study,  zoledronic acid reduced the risk of spine fractures by 70  percent and  hip fractures by 41 percent. Zoledronic acid also reduces  the risk of  more broken bones in people who have recently broken a hip.

A  healthcare provider gives zoledronic acid as an intravenous (IV)  dose of  5 mg in a doctor’s office or other outpatient setting. It takes  at  least 15 minutes for the yearly infusion. Patients need to have two   blood tests prior to each IV dose. One is a test for creatinine to   confirm that kidney function is normal. The other is a test for calcium   to confirm that the blood calcium level is normal.

##  **Side Effects of Bisphosphonates** 

Side  effects for all the bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate,   risedronate and zoledronic acid) may include bone, joint or muscle  pain.  Side effects of the oral tablets may include nausea, difficulty   swallowing, heartburn, irritation of the esophagus (tube connecting the   throat to the stomach) and gastric ulcer.

Side effects that can  occur shortly after receiving an IV  bisphosphonate include flu-like  symptoms, fever, headache and pain in  muscles or joints. These generally  stop within two to three days and  usually do not happen with future  infusions.

Inflammation of the eye (called uveitis) is a rare  side effect of  all bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are not recommended  for people  with severe kidney disease or low blood calcium. People with  certain  problems of the esophagus may not be able to take the oral  tablets.

There have been rare reports of osteonecrosis (death of  bone cells  or tissue) of the jaw (ONJ) with bisphosphonate medicines. Of  the cases  reported to date in 2007, nearly 95 percent were in cancer  patients  receiving an intravenous bisphosphonate, pamidronate (Aredia<sup>®</sup>) or zoledronate (Zometa<sup>®</sup>),   typically given every three to four weeks in much larger doses than   given for osteoporosis. Although quite unusual, patients treated with   the bisphosphonate tablets, alendronate (Fosamax<sup>®</sup>), ibandronate (Boniva<sup>®</sup>) and risedronate (Actonel<sup>®</sup>), for osteoporosis prevention or treatment have also been reported to have developed ONJ.

There  have also been recent reports of unusual fractures of the  upper femur  (thigh bone) in people taking bisphosphonate medicines. NOF  is currently  awaiting the outcome of a task force of leading experts  who are  evaluating the latest research related to these unusual  fractures. If  you have been taking bisphosphonate medicines for several  years or  longer and have an unusual ache or pain in your hip or thigh  bone, it's  important to tell your healthcare provider. There have been  rare reports  of people having an ache or pain, sometimes for several  weeks or even  months, before having an unusual break in the thigh bone.

Patients  taking the oral bisphosphonate tablets should stop taking  the drug and  contact their healthcare provider immediately when  experiencing chest  pain, new or worsening heartburn, or difficult or  painful swallowing. It  is important that patients report these or other  side effects to their  healthcare provider.

##  **Other Antiresorptive Medicines** 

### Calcitonin-Salmon

### (Brand names Fortical<sup>®</sup>and Miacalcin<sup>®</sup>)

Calcitonin  is a synthetic hormone for the treatment of osteoporosis  in  postmenopausal women who are at least five years beyond menopause.  The  naturally occurring hormone is involved in calcium regulation and  bone  metabolism.

Calcitonin slows bone loss and increases bone density  in the spine.  It reduces the risk of spine fractures but has not been  shown to  decrease the risk of non-spine fractures.

Calcitonin is  available as a nasal spray (200 IU daily) or an  injection (dosage  varies). An oral form of the drug is also being  tested in clinical  trials.

###  **Side Effects** 

Common side effects  with nasal calcitonin are a runny nose,  headache, back pain and  nosebleed (epistaxis). Injectable calcitonin  may cause an allergic  reaction and unpleasant side effects including  flushing of the face and  hands, urinary frequency, nausea and a skin  rash.

###  **Denosumab** 

### (Brand name Prolia™)

In June 2010, Denosumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of  osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture or  breaking a bone. According to the package insert, being at high risk of  fracture means that you meet one or more of the following conditions:

* you have already broken a bone from osteoporosis

* you have several risk factors for breaking a bone

* you have not been able to take other osteoporosis medicines due to side effects

* you have not received enough benefit from other osteoporosis medicines

Denosumab is a RANK ligand (RANKL) inhibitor/human monoclonal antibody.

A healthcare professional gives denosumab by injection every six  months. Patients need to have a blood test before each dose to confirm  that blood calcium level is normal. As for all people with osteoporosis,  it is very important to get enough calcium, <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span> and exercise everyday.

Denosumab reduces the risk of broken bones in the spine, hip and  other bones. In clinical trials, denosumab significantly reduced the  incidence of new spine fractures by 61 percent, reduced the incidence of  hip fractures by 40 percent and reduced the incidence of all non-spine  fractures by 20 percent over three years.

### Side Effects

Denosumab may lower the calcium levels in the blood. If blood calcium  levels are low before receiving denosumab, the low calcium level must  be corrected before giving the medicine or it will get worse. Signs of  low calcium levels include spasms, twitches or cramps in the muscles; or  numbness and tingling in the fingers, toes or around the mouth. If any  of these symptoms are seen while on this medicine, patients should  contact their healthcare provider. Most patients with low calcium  levels, however, do not show these signs.

People who have weak immune systems or take other medicines that  affect the immune system may have an increased chance of having serious  infections with denosumab. Even patients who have no immune system   problems may be at higher risk of certain infections such as those of  the skin, Patients should contact their healthcare provider right away  if signs of infection occur. These signs may include fever, chills, red  and swollen skin, skin that is hot or sore to the touch, severe pains in  the abdomen, or pain or burning when passing urine or passing urine  more frequently and in small amounts.

Denosumab may also cause skin rashes. Call your healthcare provider  if you notice any abnormal skin-related symptoms. Denosumab has caused  osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) when used to treat patients with cancer  although at this time, these have not been seen in patients with  osteoporosis. Patients should practice good dental care during treatment  and should have an examination of the mouth by a doctor or dentist  before starting the medicine.

Side effects can include back pain and musculoskeletal pain in the arms and legs.

###  **Estrogen Therapy (ET) and Hormone Therapy (HT)** 

### (Multiple brand names available)

Estrogen  therapy (ET) and estrogen with progesterone hormone therapy  (HT) are  approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal  women. ET  and HT reduce bone loss, increase bone density in both the  spine and  hip, and reduce the risk of hip, spine and other fractures in   postmenopausal women. ET and HT also relieve menopausal symptoms.

ET  and HT are commonly available as a tablet or skin (transdermal)  patch  and in other forms. Estrogen and hormone medicines come in a wide   variety of doses.

###  **Side Effects** 

When estrogen is taken alone, it can increase a woman's risk of developing cancer of the

uterine  lining (endometrial cancer). To reduce this risk, physicians  prescribe  the hormone progesterone in combination with estrogen  (hormone therapy  or HT) for those women who have a uterus. Estrogen  therapy (ET) is  prescribed for women who have had hysterectomies. Side  effects may  include vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness and gallbladder  disease.

The Woman’s Health Initiative (WHI) study confirmed that one type of HT, Prempro<sup>®</sup>(given to women who on average were more than ten years past   menopause), reduced the risk of hip and other fractures, as well as   colon cancer. However, it was associated with a slight increase in the   risk of breast cancer, strokes, heart attacks, venous blood clots and   cognitive (mental) decline. Although ET was associated with a similar   increase in the risk of strokes, venous blood clots and cognitive   decline, it did not increase the risk of breast cancer or heart attacks.

Women  who have early menopause or their ovaries removed in their 30s  or early  40s may benefit from low dose ET or HT. The results of the  WHI study do  not apply to women in this age group. Women who have had  breast cancer  or have a high risk for breast cancer should not consider  ET or HT.

According  to the FDA, postmenopausal women should consider other  osteoporosis  medicines before taking ET or HT to prevent osteoporosis.  Because  estrogen use has serious risks, women should discuss with their   healthcare providers whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Women  who  decide to take ET or HT should take the lowest possible dose for  the  shortest period of time to control menopausal symptoms.

###  **Bioidentical Hormones** 

NOF is aware that some  women are interested in taking hormones that  are prepared especially  for them by a compounding pharmacist.  These  medicines, called  bioidentical hormones, contain the same active  ingredients as ET and HT,  but are not overseen by the FDA for accuracy  of contents or purity like FDA-approved medicines. For this reason, NOF  does not recomment the use of bioidentical hormones.  It  is important  to remember that the same precautions be followed with all  preparations  containing estrogen. Always work with your healthcare provider to  determine the best treatment for you.

###  **Raloxifene** 

### (Brand name Evista<sup>®</sup>)

Raloxifene  is approved for the prevention and treatment of  osteoporosis in  postmenopausal women. It is in a class of drugs called  estrogen  agonists/antagonists that have been developed to provide the  beneficial  effects of estrogens without their potential disadvantages.  It is  neither an estrogen nor a hormone.  Raloxifene used to be called a   selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).

Raloxifene  increases bone density and reduces the risk of spine  fractures. There  are no data showing that raloxifene reduces the risk  of hip and other  non-spine fractures.

For both prevention and treatment, raloxifene is taken daily as a 60 mg tablet with or without meals.

Raloxifene  appears to decrease the risk of estrogen-dependent breast  cancer by 65  percent over eight years. It is now FDA approved to  decrease the risk of  breast cancer in women with osteoporosis and even  in women without  osteoporosis who are at high risk of breast cancer.

###  **Side Effects** 

While  side effects are not common, they include hot flashes, leg  cramps and  deep vein thrombosis (blood clots). Blood clots are also  associated with  estrogen therapy. Other side effects include swelling  and temporary  flu-like symptoms. Raloxifene is not associated with  diseases of the  uterus or ovaries and does not affect cognitive  (mental) function.

Raloxifene  should not be given to women at increased risk for  stroke. This  includes women who have had previous strokes, transient  ischemic attacks  (TIAs), atrial fibrillation (a type of serious  irregular heart beat) or  uncontrolled hypertension (high blood  pressure).

## Bone Forming (Anabolic) Medicines

### Teriparatide – Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) (1-34)

### (Brand name Forteo<sup>®</sup>)

Teriparatide,  a type of parathyroid hormone, is approved for the  treatment of  osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men who are at  high risk of  breaking a broken bone. It is also approved for the  treatment of  osteoporosis in men and women who are at high risk of  breaking a bone as  a result of taking steroid medicines for a long  time. This medicine  rebuilds bone and significantly increases bone  mineral density,  especially in the spine.

In clinical studies of postmenopausal  women using teriparatide,  fractures were reduced in the spine and  throughout the skeleton. In  men, bone density increased, but the study  was too small and not long  enough to determine whether fractures  decreased.

Good candidates for teriparatide include those who  have had an  osteoporosis related fracture and those with very low bone  density  (T-scores lower than -3.0). Teriparatide is also an option for  patients  who continue to lose bone density or break a bone during  treatment  with other osteoporosis medicines.

Teriparatide is  self-administered as a daily injection from a  pre-loaded pen containing a  one month supply of medicine. It can be  taken for a maximum of two  years. At the end of two years, to retain  the benefits of treatment with  teriparatide, most experts recommend  that patients start an  antiresorptive medicine.

### Side Effects

Side  effects include leg cramps and dizziness. Modest elevations in  serum  and urine calcium can occur, but there is no documented increase  in the  risk of kidney stones.

In animal studies, very high doses of  teriparatide that were given  for a long period of time increased the  incidence of rat osteosarcoma, a  type of bone cancer. Although common in  rats, this type of tumor is  extremely rare in adult humans. For this  reason, the FDA approved its  use for up to two years only. There has  been no evidence of increased  risk of osteosarcoma in humans taking  teriparatide.

People with certain conditions should not take this  medicine. This  includes people with Paget’s disease, children with  growing bone,  persons with unexplained serum alkaline phosphatase  elevations, and  those who have had radiation treatment involving the  skeleton. It also  should not be given to people with metabolic bone  diseases such as  hyperparathyroidism and those with cancer that has  spread to the bone.  Also, people who have certain abnormal blood tests,  including increased  calcium levels, should not take this medicine.

## Response to Treatment

A medicine that is appropriate and effective for one person may not  be the best choice for another person. People can respond differently to  treatment with the same medicine.

To  be effective, an osteoporosis medicine must be taken as  prescribed. It  is important to stay with the plan on which you and your  healthcare  provider have agreed. Most people cannot feel their bones  getting  stronger (or weaker) in response to treatment with a medicine.  So if you  decide that a particular treatment plan is not right for you,  discuss  your concerns with your healthcare provider before stopping or   interrupting treatment. For your medicine to work, you need to  exercise  regularly and continue to get enough calcium and <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>.

With  the antiresorptive medicines (bisphosphonates, calcitonin,  estrogen,  estrogen agonists/antagonists and denosumab), the goal of  treatment is  to prevent further bone loss and to reduce the risk of  fractures.  Fractures can cause deformities, disabilities, and serious,  as well as  life threatening complications. A patient has a favorable  response to  treatment when bone mineral density either remains stable  or improves  and no broken bones occur.

With the one anabolic medicine, teriparatide (Forteo®), the goal of  treatment is to rebuild  bone, increase bone mass, repair microscopic  defects in bone and reduce  the risk of fractures. A patient has a  favorable response to treatment  when both bone quantity and quality  improve and there is a substantial  increase in bone strength.

## Monitoring Treatment

Most  healthcare providers repeat the bone density test at least  every two  years to monitor the effectiveness of treatment with an  osteoporosis  medicine. Healthcare providers may have some patients  repeat a bone  density test in one year. Bone density tests and blood  and urine tests  called bone markers are the most available monitoring  tools. At the  current time, there is no easy way to measure improvement  in bone  quality. 

## How Long to Treat

There are  currently no conclusive research findings to suggest how  long an  osteoporosis drug remains safe and effective, except for  teriparatide  (Forteo<sup>®</sup>). Teriparatide can be taken for no  more than two  years according to the FDA. It is uncertain how long any  of the  osteoporosis medicines remain effective after they are stopped.

## Past Experience and Studies

Past experience with bisphosphonates (Actonel<sup>®</sup>, Boniva<sup>®</sup>and Fosamax<sup>®</sup>)   suggests that upon discontinuation of any of these drugs, the benefits   may continue for several years or longer. This is because the drugs   remain in the bone for a long time. Eventually, however, the beneficial   effect begins to lessen, bone remodeling rates increase and bone loss   may occur.

One study found that alendronate (Fosamax<sup>®</sup>)  continued to  have a beneficial effect on bone mineral density for up to  10 years in  postmenopausal women taking the medicine. Biopsies of bone  tissue in  women on alendronate for 10 years show that bone tissue looks  healthy  and normal. Other studies show that treating with alendronate  for more  than five years improves bone strength and reduces fractures of  the  spine.

Another study suggested that women who discontinued  taking  alendronate after five years of treatment did not significantly   increase their fracture risk for up to an additional five years. Women   who stopped alendronate after five years had the same rate of non-spine   fractures as women who continued using the drug for 10 years. However,   the study found that women at very high risk of spine fractures may   benefit by continuing to take alendronate beyond five years.

## Drug Holiday

When  a patient has a good response to treatment with an osteoporosis   medicine, some healthcare providers will consider a drug holiday. This   means stopping the medicine for a period of time and continuing to   monitor bone mineral density. Some healthcare providers consider a drug   holiday after five years when there has been a good response to   treatment. Others view it as an option when bone mineral density tests   are performed two years apart, and the test results are similar and show   a good response to treatment.

Although some healthcare providers  give drug holidays, there are few  research findings that support (or  not support) this practice.

In the absence of clinical studies on  duration of treatment,  healthcare providers and patients should discuss  options to determine  the best course of action. NOF encourages all  healthcare providers to  evaluate a patient on the basis of clinical risk  factors, such as the  presence or absence of fractures, bone density  status, age, weight,  smoking and alcohol use. Length of treatment should  be individualized  and based on the person’s medical and fracture  history, as well as the  initial and most recent bone mineral density  test results.

## Adverse Events

When a  patient has a serious reaction or problem with a drug, either  the  patient or patient’s healthcare provider should notify the FDA to  report  the problem. The toll free number for the FDA is 1 (800)  332-1088. To  complete a report online, visit the FDA Web site at   www.fda.gov/medwatch. Patients also may want to notify the   pharmaceutical manufacturer of the adverse event. The chart appearing   below provides the phone numbers of the pharmaceutical manufacturers and   the date each medicine was approved by the FDA as an osteoporosis   medicine.

## Nutrition and Exercise

To  protect bone health, it is important that all persons have a   nutritionally balanced diet, which includes calcium-rich foods and  <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>. Adults age 50 and older need 1,200 mg of calcium and  800-1,000 IU of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span> every day. Adults under age 50 need 1,000 mg of calcium and 400–800 IU of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span> every day.

Because  of the importance of <span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span> to bone, healthcare providers may  suggest that patients with osteoporosis have a lab test for <span style="color:#00F;"></span>#00F:vitamin D<span style="color:~~.  Based on the test results;background-color: healthcare providers may recommend taking  more ~~#00F;">vitamin D</span> supplements.

A program of appropriate weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening exercises also helps to promote bone health.
