CONTEXT: No studies have assessed the associations between air pollution exposure and vitamin D status in pregnant women.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between particulate air pollution exposure and circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels in pregnant women.

DESIGN: A longitudinal cohort study.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3285 pregnant women were recruited at a Maternal and Child Health Hospital.

INTERVENTIONS: None.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum 25(OH)D levels.

RESULTS: We observed trimester-specific associations between particulate air pollution exposure and circulating 25(OH)D levels. The associations were most pronounced for the periods of third trimester and the entire pregnancy. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with a 4.62% (95% CI, -6.31% to -2.93%) and 5.06% (95% CI, -6.50% to -3.62%) decrease in 25(OH)D levels, respectively. Particulate air pollution exposure was also associated with elevated odds of maternal vitamin D deficiency. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with a 45% (OR=1.45, 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.63) and 48% (OR=1.48, 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.64) increase in the odds of maternal vitamin D deficiency. Mediation analysis estimated that decreased solar UVB radiation mediated 69.5% and 66.4% of the inverse association between PM2.5 and PM10 exposure and circulating 25(OH)D levels.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to particulate air pollution may play an independent role in maternal vitamin D deficiency. The role of air pollution should be incorporated into future guidelines for the prevention of maternal vitamin D deficiency.
