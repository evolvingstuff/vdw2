#### Testimony in UK Parliament: Show us the data!

 **[Robert Malone substack](https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/testimony-in-uk-parliament-show-us?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=583200&post_id=139457252&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=ofo3r&utm_medium=email)** 

Members of Congress in the USA and in Parliaments all over the worlds 

&nbsp; are hearing one main topic from their constituents.

* What about the cover-up about the origins of the virus?

* What about the dangers of the vaccine?

* What about the cover-up of the effectiveness of early treatments?

* What about the censorship?

* When is the government going to come clean?

 **Problems "that did not matter"** 

* It didn’t matter that that the Sargent of Arms downgraded the room request, to only fit a third of those that wanted in.

* It didn’t matter that the Sargent of Arms refused the application of various media outlets to film the testimony.

* It didn’t matter that  **“they” turned off all the cameras**  - that are meant to record every meeting in the building.

* It didn’t even matter that “they” had “AV issues”, so a  **muted video feed**  was all that was available.

* It didn’t matter that the TV in the room for presentations was muted- with no remote controls.

* It didn’t matter that “they” placed many uniformed guards outside the hearing room, something people in the room said had not witnessed before

##### Only 12 of the 650 Members of Parliament attended
