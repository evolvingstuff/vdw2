#### Association of functional, inherited vitamin D-binding protein variants with melanoma-specific death

JNCI Cancer Spectr . 2023 Jul 26;pkad051. [doi: 10.1093/jncics/pkad051](https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkad051)

Background: It is unclear whether genetic variants affecting vitamin D metabolism are associated with melanoma prognosis. Two functional missense variants in the vitamin D-binding protein gene (GC), rs7041 and rs4588, determine three common haplotypes Gc1s, Gc1f, and Gc2. Gc1f may be associated with decreased all-cause death among melanoma patients, based on results of a prior study, but its association with melanoma-specific death is unclear.

Methods: We investigated the association of the Gc1s, Gc1f, and Gc2 haplotypes with melanoma-specific and all-cause death among 4,490 individuals with incident, invasive primary melanoma in two population-based studies using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards regression.

Results: In the pooled analysis of both datasets, those with the Gc1f haplotype had a 37% lower risk of melanoma-specific death compared to those without Gc1f (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span> = 0.63, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 0.47 to 0.83, P = 0.001) adjusting for age, sex, study center, first or higher-order primary melanoma, tumor site, pigmentary phenotypes, and Breslow thickness. Associations were similar in both studies. In pooled analyses stratified by Breslow thickness, the corresponding melanoma-specific death HRs for those with the Gc1f haplotype compared to those without Gc1f were 0.89 (95% CI = 0.63 to 1.27) among participants with tumors â‰¤2.0 mm and 0.40 (95% CI = 0.25 to 0.63) among participants with tumors >2.0 mm (Pinteraction= 0.003).

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individuals with the GC haplotype Gc1f may have a lower risk of dying from melanoma-specifically from thicker, higher-risk melanoma-compared to those without Gc1f.
