We aimed to investigate the associations between exposures to food additive emulsifiers and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a large prospective cohort of French adults.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We analysed data from 104 139 adults enrolled in the French NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study from May 1, 2009, to April 26, 2023; 82 456 (79·2%) were female and the mean age was 42·7 years (SD 14·5). Dietary intakes were assessed with <strong>three 24 h dietary records collected over three non-consecutive days, every 6 months.</strong> Exposure to additive emulsifiers was evaluated through multiple food composition databases and ad-hoc laboratory assays. Associations between cumulative time-dependent exposures to food additive emulsifiers and the risk of type 2 diabetes were characterised with multivariable proportional hazards Cox models adjusted for known risk factors. The NutriNet-Santé study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03335644).</p><p>Findings</p><p>Of 104 139 participants, 1056 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during follow-up (mean follow-up duration 6·8 years <span>[SD 3·7]</span>).

The search terms were “(diabetes or type 2 diabetes or diabetes mellitus)” AND “(food additive emulsifiers or emulsifiers)”. A small number of experimental studies (in vitro, animal, and short-term randomised controlled trials) suggested adverse effects of some emulsifiers such as</p><ul><li><p>gut microbiota dysbiosis,</p></li><li><p>inflammation, and</p></li><li><p>metabolic perturbations.</p><ul><li><span style=color:#00f>(all 3 of which are fought by vitamin D)</span></li></ul></li></ul><p>Two cohort studies from our group showed associations between exposure to various food additive emulsifiers and</p><p>an increased risk of</p><ul><li><p>cardiovascular disease and</p></li><li><p>cancer.</p></li></ul><p>No such investigation has, to the best of our knowledge, yet been conducted to assess the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Added value of this study</p><p>The present study is the first to quantitatively assess exposure to food additive emulsifiers in a large-scale cohort (n=104 139), thereby providing novel insights into the association of emulsifiers with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Sparse details on the specific industrial food products consumed were available in previous epidemiological studies worldwide, but the variation in additive composition is huge for two different brands of the same food item (eg, <strong>a chocolate biscuit can contain zero to eight different additives</strong> ). Thus, we evaluated the occurrence and dose of exposures to food additive emulsifiers by linking detailed dietary records from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (including commercial names and brands of industrial foods and beverages) to multiple food composition databases, ad-hoc laboratory assays, and dynamic matching to account for reformulations of industrial food items over time. We observed that higher intakes of seven individual emulsifiers (European codes: E407, E340, E472e, E331, E412, E414, and E415) and one emulsifier group (total carrageenans) were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><p><strong>Implications of all the available evidence</strong></p><p>These findings could have important public health implications given the ubiquitous nature of these food additives used in thousands of widely consumed ultra-processed products ingested daily by millions of children and adults globally. Although additional long-term observational epidemiological studies as well as short-term interventions (for ethical reasons) are needed to confirm these findings, they align with those of previous in-vitro and in-vivo experiments suggesting adverse effects of several emulsifiers. <strong>Altogether, the available evidence supports a re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of food additive emulsifiers by the food industry for a better consumer protection</strong> . Indeed, current acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) were set up on the basis of classical cytotoxicity and genotoxicity criteria but neither included clinical epidemiological data on hard endpoints (which are missing so far) nor the latest experimental research (eg, on microbiota dysbiosis). As we advance our understanding of the potential role of additives in the development of diabetes, several public health authorities already recommend minimising the consumption of ultra-processed foods in order to lower exposure to controversial so-called cosmetic food additives.</p><p>However, to the best of our knowledge, no epidemiological study has quantified dietary exposures to a wide range of food additive emulsifiers and investigated their associations with the risk of type 2 diabetes. This research gap can be explained by the sparse details of specific industrial food products consumed in previous epidemiological studies. Emulsifier composition indeed varies greatly from one industrial product to another, for the same type of food. A chocolate biscuit, for example, could contain zero to eight different emulsifiers, depending on the brand. The NutriNet-Santé cohort has the potential to advance knowledge in this field, since it has collected extensive brand-specific dietary data through validated repeated 24 h dietary records since 2009. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between emulsifier exposure and type 2 diabetes risk in the NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/food-additive-emulsifiers-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=asked-perplexity-ai-may-2024>Asked Perplexity AI May 2024</h4><h5 id=do-food-emulsifiers-increase-the-risk-of-diabetes>Do food emulsifiers increase the risk of diabetes?</h5><p>Based on the search results provided, there is evidence suggesting that consumption of certain food emulsifier additives may be associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

The authors acknowledge the need for further research to establish causal links and understand the underlying mechanisms . Replication in other epidemiological studies is also needed to strengthen the evidence.</p><p>In summary, while not conclusive, this study provides initial epidemiological data indicating that chronic consumption of certain food emulsifier additives may be associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, likely mediated through effects on the gut microbiome and metabolic processes. But more research is still needed.</p><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Do-food-emulsifiers-UEmtpifiSXeYl1W77ZvokQ>Click here for 20 references</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=how-do-emulsifiers-affect-gut-health>How do emulsifiers affect gut health?</h5><p>Emulsifiers, commonly used in processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life, have been increasingly scrutinized for their potential impact on gut health.

Certain emulsifiers, particularly CMC and P80, have been shown to disrupt gut microbiota and promote inflammation, which may contribute to various chronic diseases. Reducing the intake of processed foods and opting for emulsifier-free or minimally processed options can help mitigate these risks.</p><hr><h4 id=how-do-emulsifiers-impact-gut-health---r-patrick-video-dec-2024>How do emulsifiers impact gut health? - R Patrick Video Dec 2024</h4><p><strong><a href=https://r.sib.foundmyfitness.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2nfsZpYjdK7KqHalkN889o1q/TUbxw2t7A1mR>YouTube - 15 minutes</a></strong></p><p>extremely common in ultraprocessed foods.
