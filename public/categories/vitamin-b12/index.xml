&lt;p>People are increasingly encouraged to reduce animal food consumption and shift towards plant-based diets; however, the implications for children&amp;rsquo;s health are unclear. In this narrative review of research in high-income settings, we summarize evidence on the increasing consumption of plant-based diets in children and update an earlier systematic review regarding their associations with children&amp;rsquo;s health outcomes. The evidence indicates that vegan, but not vegetarian, diets can restrict growth relative to omnivorous children and increase the risk of being stunted and underweight, although the percentage affected is relatively small. Bone mineral content is reduced in vegetarian and, in particular, vegan children, compared to omnivores.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
