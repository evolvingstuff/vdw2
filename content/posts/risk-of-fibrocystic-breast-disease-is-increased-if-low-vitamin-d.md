Background: Previous research has established a link between vitamin D deficiency and various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on benign breast diseases, such as fibrocystic breast disease (FB), remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between fibrocystic breast disease and vitamin D deficiency.

Objectives: To determine the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the prevalence and development of fibrocystic breast disease. Methods: A two-pronged approach was employed in this investigation. First, a hospital-based prevalence study was conducted from February 1, 2024, to June 1, 2024, at Al-Yarmouk Hospital, involving 88 women. The sample was divided into a control group of 44 women with no pathological condition and a study group of 44 women diagnosed with fibrocystic breast disease, all of whom had varying results in their vitamin D tests. Second, a case-control analysis was implemented. The study group consisted of women diagnosed with FB based on breast pain, physical examination findings, and ultrasound confirmation. The control group comprised age-matched women without FB.

Results: The study indicates a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and the presence of FB, suggesting that low vitamin D levels may be a risk factor for developing FB. The p-value of 0.000472 indicates that the differences in vitamin D levels between the FB cases and controls are statistically significant (p< 0.05).

Conclusion: This study links vitamin D insufficiency to fibrocystic breast disease. Age and occupation were similar between groups, but vitamin D levels were significantly lower among FB women. This complements previous research showing vitamin D may protect breast health and reduce fibrocystic alterations. Vitamin D supplementation may prevent or treat fibrocystic breast disease. More study is needed to understand this relationship.

Background: The role of deficiency of vitamin D in a wide range of human cancer, including breast cancer, has been proven, but its role in benign breast diseases remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with fibrocystic breast (FB) disease.

Methods: First, the hospital prevalence of fibrocystic breast was determined by a crosssectional study. Then, patients were divided into two groups by a case-control study; women with confirmed fibrocystic breasts based on breast pain, physical examination, and ultrasonography were included as a case group (N=48), and age-matched women without fibrocystic breasts were also included as a control group (N=48). After recording the demographic and gynecological characteristics and exposure to the sun, gynecological records, and family history of fibrocystic breast, the blood sample was taken to determine vitamin D. Data were analyzed by Stata software.

Results: The result indicated that the studied groups had significant differences in regards to weight, breast pain, the severity of breast pain, breast heaviness, family history of fibrocystic breast, history of breast disease, caffeine consumption, and exposure to sunlight (p <0.05), but did not show significant differences based on age, occupation, education, gynecological history, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and hypothyroidism, vegetable, fast food, and dairy products consumption.  **The frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the case group was 45.8%, and in the control group, it was 20.8%,**  and there was a statistically significant difference (p <0.05).

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is more common in women with fibrocystic breast disease and may play a role in the development of the disease.

#### Relationship of blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D level with fibrocystic breast disease and breast density - 2022

Cukurova Medical Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 2022, pp. 161-8, [doi: [10.17826/cumj.1016601](https://doi.org/[10.17826/cumj.1016601)|FREE PDF]

 **Breast Pattern:   
Fatty (ta),  scattered fibroglandular density (tb), heterogeneously dense (tc), and  extremely dense (td)** 

Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels with fibrocystic breast masses and breast patterns.

Materials and Methods: The study included 612 patients who presented with breast complaints or referred for routine screening between 2018-2021 and were requested to have breast ultrasonography (USG) and mammography (MG) examinations. Patients were divided into two groups; group 1 consisted of women with fibrocystic mass (BI-RADS 2-3) and group 2 consisted of women without breast mass (BI-RADS 1). These two groups were compared by age, breast USG, MG results, and blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels.

Results: Of the 612 patients, 310 

* (51%) had fibrocystic mass in their breasts, while 302 

* (49%) had normal breasts. 

The mean age of both groups was similar. Those with fibrocystic mass in the breast had lower vitamin D levels and higher breast density than the control group. The group with higher breast density had lower vitamin D levels, and there was a negative correlation between vitamin D level and breast density

Conclusion: Our study revealed that women with fibrocystic masses in their breasts (BI- RADS2 and BI-RADS3) had higher breast density and lower vitamin D levels than women without breast mass.
