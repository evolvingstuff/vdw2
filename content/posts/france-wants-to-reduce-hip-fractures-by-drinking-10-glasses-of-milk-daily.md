#### The projected public health and economic impact of vitamin D fortified dairy products for fracture prevention in France.

Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res. 2018 Apr;18(2):191-195. [doi: 10.1080/14737167.2017.1375406.](https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2017.1375406.) Epub 2017 Sep 7.

Estimate of hip fracture savings was overly optomistic

Estimated hip fracture savings assumed that all French would get an extra 800 IU of vitamin D by dairy supplementation.

The highest level of vitamin D supplementation in the world is 100 IU per glass (US)

Skim milk is consumed fat more often than full-fat milk  in this century

Unfortunately the vitamin D in [skim milk is 2.5 less bioavailable](/posts/skim-fat-milk-provides-3-percent-less-vitamin-d) than that in full-fat milk

The study assumes an intake of 800 IU daily from dairy 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note 800 IU is the bare minimum necessary to prevent hip fractures, more is much better

Dairy includes milk, yogurt, and cheese

Let's assume that half of 800 IU of vitamin D will come from milk (400 IU)

To get 400 IU from  **skim milk**  a person would need to drink  **10**  glasses (4 * 2.5)
