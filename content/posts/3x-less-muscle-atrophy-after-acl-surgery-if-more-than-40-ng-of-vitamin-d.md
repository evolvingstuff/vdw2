#### Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Upregulates Vitamin D Activating Pathways within the Quadriceps

FASEB J . 2022 May;36 Suppl 1. [doi: 10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.L7890.](https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.L7890.) abstract of presentation

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are prevalent sport-related injuries that result in protracted quadriceps atrophy and weakness despite surgical reconstruction and physical therapy. Vitamin D and its receptor are integral for skeletal muscle development and homeostasis. In addition, vitamin D status is positively associated with muscle size and strength. If the vitamin D receptor and related enzymes are upregulated with ACL injury and reconstruction, then overall vitamin D status may be an important effector of recovery. Concentrations of vitamin D needed to support optimal recovery may differ from typical clinical cut points used to diagnose vitamin D deficiency, which could have powerful therapeutic implications following ACL injury and reconstruction. This is especially important given recent research showing over 50% of athletes have vitamin D inadequacy. We hypothesized that subjects with circulating  **vitamin D sufficient to suppress parathyroid hormone secretion (≥ 40 ng/mL)**  would be better protected against quadriceps atrophy at the conclusion of rehabilitation. Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained from ACL-injured and Healthy limbs of 16 participants (6M,10F; 19±5yr, body mass index: 25.1±3.7kg/m2) prior to surgical reconstruction, 1 week following reconstruction (Recon), and following the completion of post-surgical rehabilitation (6 months following surgery, Post-Rehab). RNA was isolated from all quadriceps biopsies, followed by library construction, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis. Transcript abundance of vitamin D activating pathway regulators (vitamin D receptor <span>[VDR]</span>, and Cytochrome P450 2R1 <span>[CYP2R1]</span> and Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 <span>[CYP27B1]</span>) was assessed following analysis using DESeq2 and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment of p-values. Additionally, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was assessed in serum samples obtained at the time of reconstruction surgery. Quadriceps fiber cross-sectional area was measured via laminin immunohistochemistry. Recon (1 week post-surgery) muscle showed increased transcript abundance of the vitamin D receptor, VDR(elevated 7.8 fold, FDR<0.05), and vitamin D-activating pathway regulators CYP2R1 (elevated 1.5 fold, FDR<0.05) and CYP27B1 (elevated 2.6 fold, FDR<0.05) when compared to the Healthy limb. 

Following the completion of rehabilitation at the 6-month follow-up, participants with 25(OH)D 

* above 40 ng/mL showed 6.4% atrophy of quadriceps fiber size compared to 

* 22.8% atrophy in participants with 25(OH)D below 40 ng/mL (p=0.06). 

These findings provide evidence for surgically induced elevations in the vitamin D activating pathway within skeletal muscle. Upregulation of the vitamin D activating pathway may support quadriceps mitochondrial health and satellite cell activity and self-renewal capacity, both of which are compromised following ACL reconstruction. In addition, elevated vitamin D concentrations may protect against protracted quadriceps atrophy. Future research should investigate if manipulation of vitamin D concentrations can enhance quadriceps functional recovery following ACL reconstruction.
