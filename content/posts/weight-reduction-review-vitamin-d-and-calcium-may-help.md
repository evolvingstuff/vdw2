## Calcium and vitamin D for obesity: a review of randomized controlled trials.

Eur J Clin Nutr. 2011 Jul 6. [doi: 10.1038/ejcn.2011.106.](https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2011.106.)

Obesity often coexists with low calcium intake and vitamin D insufficiency. There is emerging evidence of a role for these nutrients in the regulation of body weight. However, it is unclear whether increasing intakes of calcium and/or vitamin D during energy restriction, is a better strategy for weight and fat loss. We searched the literature from 2000 to date for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on weight loss that had increased calcium or vitamin D per se, or in combination. Primary and secondary studies were included for this analysis. 

A total of 15 RCTs on calcium with or without vitamin D and seven on vitamin D alone met our criteria. 

 **Two**  studies reported that supplemental calcium significantly increased fat loss during caloric restriction by  **1.8 and 2.2?kg** ,  **three**  found differences between  **1 and 3.5?kg but were statistically nonsignificant** , while  **nine trials were equivocal (±0.7?kg)** . The data on vitamin D supplementation during weight loss were too few to make firm conclusions. Current evidence from RCTs did not consistently support the contention that calcium and vitamin D accelerated weight or fat loss in obesity. There were studies that favoured the hypothesis but lacked the statistical power. There is a need for RCTs to examine the influence of vitamin D on body fat.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance
