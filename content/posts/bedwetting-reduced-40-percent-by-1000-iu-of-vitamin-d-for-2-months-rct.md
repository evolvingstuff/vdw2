Introduction

Nocturnal enuresis is known to be a common urinary bladder complication in children. Recent studies have associated vitamin D and omega-3 insufficiency with nocturnal enuresis.

Aim

This was a 2-month randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to measure the effects of vitamin D, omega-3 supplements, and their combination on nocturnal enuresis among 7-15-year-old children.

Materials and Methods

Participants (180 children with nocturnal enuresis) were selected from children referred to the Pediatric ward of Imam Reza Clinic in Shiraz, Iran. Demographic information and anthropometric measures were taken. Fasting blood and urine samples were also collected, and serum vitamin D and urine prostaglandin E2 were measured before and after intervention. Enuretic children were randomly assigned to four groups: Group A, vitamin D (1000 IU/day); Group B, omega-3 (1000 mg/day); Group C, both omega-3 (1000 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU/day); and Group D, placebo.

Results

The results suggested that the study groups were not significantly different regarding demographic and anthropometric measures at baseline. Comparison of different groups revealed that 44.4% of participants in Group A, 28.2% of Group B and 45% of Group C were cured from enuresis (P=0.03). Serum 25(OH) D was significantly increased in Group A, but urine prostaglandin E2 was not significantly decreased in response to supplementation. Although supplementation with both Group A and Group B were found to be effective, the combined intervention did not increase the effect of each intervention solely.

Conclusions

The results showed that supplementation with vitamin D and omega-3 could reduce the number of wet nights among 7-15-year-old children with nocturnal enuresis.

#### Comment on study by VitaminDWiki

Can anticipate much better success for each of the following

* Use more vitamin D - perhaps 2,000 IU daily

* Longer period of time - often Vitamin D levels do not plateau for 6 months

> &nbsp; &nbsp; this trial lasted 2 months

* Use a loading dose to get high vitamin D levels in days rather than months
