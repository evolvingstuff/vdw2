#### The pharmaceutical industry is dangerous to health. Further proof with COVID-19

Surg Neurol Int. 2022; 13: 475.. [doi: 10.25259/SNI_377_2022](https://doi.org/10.25259/SNI_377_2022)

Fabien Deruelle fderuelle@hotmail.com

Background:

The COVID-19 period highlights a huge problem that has been developing for decades, the control of science by industry. In the 1950s, the tobacco industry set the example, which the pharmaceutical industry followed. Since then, the latter has been regularly condemned for illegal marketing, misrepresentation of experimental results, dissimulation of information about the dangers of drugs, and considered as criminal. Therefore, this study was conducted to show that knowledge is powerfully manipulated by harmful corporations, whose goals are: 1/financial; 2/to suppress our ability to make choices to acquire global control of public health.

Methods:

Pharmaceutical industry techniques for manipulating science and COVID-19 reporting were reviewed. Several sources of official documents were used: PubMed; National Institutes of Health resources; pharmaceutical companies; policy documents; national newspapers and news agencies; and books by prominent professionals (scientific and legal). A few studies have not been published in peer-reviewed journals; however, they have been conducted by reputable scientists in their respective fields.

Results:

Since the beginning of COVID-19, we can list the following methods of information manipulation which have been used: 

1. falsified clinical trials and inaccessible data; 

1. fake or conflict-of-interest studies; 

1. concealment of vaccines’ 

1. short-term side effects and total lack of knowledge of the long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccination; 

1. doubtful composition of vaccines;

1. inadequate testing methods; 

1. governments and international organizations under conflicts of interest; 

1. bribed physicians; 

1. the denigration of renowned scientists; 

1. the banning of all alternative effective treatments; 

1. unscientific and liberticidal social methods; 

1. government use of behavior modification and social engineering techniques to

   * impose confinements, masks, and vaccine acceptance; 

1. scientific censorship by the media.

Conclusion:

By supporting and selecting only the one side of science information while suppressing alternative viewpoints, and with obvious conflicts of interest revealed by this study, governments and the media constantly disinform the public. Consequently, the unscientifically validated vaccination laws, originating from industry-controlled medical science, led to the adoption of social measures for the supposed protection of the public but which became serious threats to the health and freedoms of the population.

##### Editor’s Note:

SNI is devoted to publishing the truth. SNI has no characteristics by which it judges papers except by fact- supported information. The COVID-19 pandemic is one that is marked by conflicting and confusing information for the public. The only solution to this problem scientifically is to hear all sides of the issue, so that a reasonable decision can be made. 

Instead, we find and learn that practice was not and is not being done. 

* Is the virus a lethal as is described with high death rates? 

* Should everyone be vaccinated and receive booster including small children and babies? 

* Should people wear masks and socially isolate? 

* Are the vaccines safe to use or do they have complications, notable of which are their respiratory, blood clotting, and neurological effects? 

* Why is the public not being told about them? 

* Are their deeper self-serving interests among the pharmaceutical companies, the Media, and governments to limit what the public knows? 

* What is the truth? 

Fabien Deruelle, a French scientist, who is an independent thinker, saw some disturbing factors involved in the COVID -19 reporting. After spending 8 months researching and writing on his own to learn that the controversies surrounding COVID-19, he concluded that there was a huge amount of misinformation being told and spread, intentionally. 

 **The science was being corrupted by bureaucratic, governmental, pharmaceutical company, Media, and political forces so that the truth was not being told.**  The following is his review of the literature on the COVID-19 controversies. Hence, this independent scientist has discovered known facts which have been suppressed and are emerging in SNI pages and now, elsewhere around the world. His independent observations are what makes his report special. If you want to see my interview with him about his experience with the COVID-19 controversy, click here: [https://vimeo.com/755630905.](https://vimeo.com/755630905.) You decide.
