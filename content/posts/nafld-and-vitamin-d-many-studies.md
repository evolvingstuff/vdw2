#### NAFLD ==> decreased semi-activation of vitamin D: should use a form that does not need the liver

 **[Topical Vitamin D](/posts/topical-vitamin-d)** 

 **Alternately: use larger doses of Vitamin D** 

---

#### NAFLD was renamed as MASLD in 2023 –  [Perplexity AI Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/describe-how-nafld-become-masl-IsIOLaYpSRu8KDaqz5hPUg)

In 2023, multinational liver societies agreed to change the terminology from Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10901669/). This change was implemented to better reflect the disease's etiology and reduce associated stigma.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Key Changes in Definition</span>** 

 **Diagnostic Criteria** 

MASLD requires two main components:

* Presence of hepatic steatosis (identified through imaging or biopsy)

* At least one cardiometabolic risk factor, such as:

   * BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²

   * Enlarged waist circumference

   * Diabetes

   * Hypertension

   * Elevated triglycerides

   * Low HDL levels [1](https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/1001273)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">New Classification System</span>** 

 **Steatotic Liver Disease (SLD)** 

This serves as the umbrella term encompassing various causes of liver steatosis [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10901669/). Under SLD, there are several subcategories:

* MASLD (primary metabolic cause)

* MetALD (combined metabolic and alcohol factors)

* ALD (alcoholic liver disease)

* Cryptogenic SLD [1](https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/1001273)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Alcohol Consumption Thresholds</span>** 

 **MetALD Classification** 

A new category called MetALD was introduced for individuals with MASLD who consume alcohol within specific ranges:

* Women: 140-350 grams of ethanol per week

* Men: 210-420 grams of ethanol per week [1](https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/1001273)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Disease Progression</span>** 

MASLD can progress through several stages:

1. Fatty liver (no scarring)

1. MASH with mild fibrosis

1. MASH with moderate fibrosis

1. MASH with advanced fibrosis

1. Cirrhosis [4](https://britishlivertrust.org.uk/information-and-support/liver-conditions/masld-nafld-and-fatty-liver-disease/)

This new terminology better reflects the metabolic nature of the disease and provides a more precise framework for diagnosis and treatment strategies [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10901669/). The change was implemented through a transparent consensus process using the Delphi method, involving over 200 liver disease experts [5](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/gastrointestinal-articles/fatty-liver-disease-becomes-steatotic-liver-disease-chicago-metabolic-liver-clinic-expert-rinella) [8](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/afp-community-blog/entry/new-year-new-name-nafld-becomes-masld.html).

#### The association between MASLD and Vitamin D – [Perplexity AI Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-association-betwee-e.5xwOXYSDCYxEV.4p6M4g)

Vitamin D deficiency shows a significant association with Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), affecting both its development and progression [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38732118/) [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084591/). This relationship operates through several key mechanisms:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Metabolic Effects</span>** 

 **Insulin Sensitivity** : Vitamin D influences insulin sensitivity, which is crucial in MASLD pathogenesis. Improved insulin sensitivity helps prevent excessive fat accumulation in the liver [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38732118/). The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is abundantly expressed in liver cells, indicating its direct regulatory role in hepatic function [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084591/).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Protective Mechanisms</span>** 

 **Anti-inflammatory Properties** : Vitamin D exhibits substantial anti-inflammatory effects by:

* Inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines

* Reducing oxidative stress

* Suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38732118/)

 **Anti-fibrotic Effects** : Vitamin D demonstrates anti-fibrotic properties in the liver by inhibiting hepatic stellate cell proliferation and downregulating pro-fibrotic mediators [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084591/).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Clinical Implications</span>** 

Low vitamin D levels correlate with increased MASLD severity and risk [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57380-9). Recent epidemiological studies have consistently shown that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with:

* Higher incidence of MASLD

* More severe liver steatosis

* Increased disease progression [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38732118/) [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-57380-9)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Molecular Pathways</span>** 

The vitamin D-VDR signaling pathway influences MASLD through multiple mechanisms:

* Activation of antioxidant molecules

* Regulation of glucose metabolism

* Modulation of lipid metabolism

* Interaction with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11084591/)

Recent research suggests that addressing vitamin D deficiency could be a promising therapeutic strategy for MASLD management, particularly in patients with mild to moderate liver damage [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33126575/).

#### NAFLD treatment could be helped by Omega-3 - meta-analysis Aug 2024

 **Effectiveness of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis** 

Cureus. 2024 Aug 28;16(8):e68002. [doi: 10.7759/cureus.68002](https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.68002)

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent liver disorder characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation without alcohol intake. It can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and liver failure. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in treating NAFLD. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted including studies published from January 2018 to June 2023. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trials and cohort studies involving human subjects or animal models with NAFLD. Data were extracted and analyzed to assess the impact of omega-3 PUFAs on liver fat, hepatic enzymes, and serum lipid profiles using RevMan 5.4. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Omega-3 supplementation significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (mean difference = -2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.36, -0.87) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (mean difference = -1.50, 95% CI = -2.59, -0.42). Gamma-glutamyl transferase levels showed a trend toward reduction (mean difference = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.66, 0.02). Serum lipid profiles improved significantly with reductions in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol along with significant reductions in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase in animal models. Omega-3 PUFAs appear to offer beneficial effects on liver enzymes, serum lipid profiles, and anthropometric indices in NAFLD patients. While their impact on liver fat content remains uncertain, omega-3 supplementation could serve as a valuable adjunct treatment for enhancing metabolic profiles and liver function in NAFLD patients.

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/nafld-treat.jpg" alt="image" width="300">

Background: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has become a significant public health concern, affecting approximately one-fourth of the population. Despite its prevalence, no FDA-approved drug treatments specifically target NAFLD.

Aim: To provide a review of clinical trials investigating the use of herbal remedies and dietary supplements in NAFLD management, utilizing the ClinicalTrials.gov database.

Methods: This review evaluates the current evidence by examining completed phase III and IV clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. An exhaustive search was performed on April 17, 2023, using the terms "Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease" and "NAFLD." Two independent reviewers appraised eligible trials based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results: An initial search yielded 1,226 clinical trials, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria after filtration. 

The majority of trials focused on 

* Omega-3 fatty acids (20.0%) and 

* vitamin D (26.7%), 

followed by caffeine, chlorogenic acid, ginger, phosphatidylcholine, Trigonella Foenum-graecum seed extract, vitamin C, and vitamin E (each 6.7%). Most studies were Phase 3 (75.0%) and used a parallel assignment model (91.7%). Quadruple masking was the most prevalent technique (58.3%), and Iran was the leading country in terms of trial locations (25.0%). These interventions constitute two herbal interventions and nine supplement interventions.

Conclusion: This reveals a diverse range of nutraceuticals, with Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D being predominant in the management of NAFLD. The global distribution of trials highlights the widespread interest in these therapeutics. However, more rigorous, large-scale trials are needed to establish safety, efficacy, and optimal dosages.

There has been conflicting evidence from meta-analyses on the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, in this umbrella meta-analysis, we are evaluating whether omega-3 PUFA supplementation has any benefit in treating NAFLD. Electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and Google Scholar were assessed to October 2022. This meta-analysis included all meta-analyses that examined the effect of PUFAs on liver fat and liver function tests <span>[aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)]</span>. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed.

In total, eight articles involving 6,561 participants met the eligibility criteria. Advantageous impacts PUFA supplementation were observed on ALT (ESWMD = −6.72 IU/L; 95% CI: −8.61, −4.84; p < 0.001, and ESSMD = −0.52 IU/L; 95% CI: −0.84, −0.20, p < 0.001), AST (ESWMD = −3.73 IU/L, 95% CI: −5.93, −1.53, p < 0.001, and ESSMD = −0.65 IU/L; 95% CI: −1.08, −0.22, p = 0.003), GGT levels (ESWMD = −4.20 IU/L, 95% CI: −6.85, −1.55, p = 0.002), and liver fat (ESWMD = −5.16; 95% CI: −8.49, −1.82, p < 0.001). Intervention with omega-3 PUFAs improves ALT, AST, GGT, and liver fat in patients with NAFLD. 

Thus, omega-3 PUFAs could be considered as a therapeutic option in the treatment of NAFLD.

Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) is one of the most common progressive metabolic disorders worldwide. There are increasing scientific interests nowadays for the association between vitamin D status and Non-alcoholic fatty liver. Earlier studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients that contributes to poor outcomes. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral cholecalciferol on Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients. 

Subjects and Methods: This study was conducted on 140 patients that were randomized either to group 1 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to placebo or group 2 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to cholecalciferol during the 4 months study period. 

Results: At the end of the study group 2 revealed significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the mean serum level of TG, LDL-C, TC, hsCRP as compared to their baseline results and group 1 results. Additionally, a significant improvement in the serum levels of ALT (p = 0.001) was seen in group 2 at the end of the study when compared to group 1. Whereas group 1 did not show any change in these parameters when compared to group 2 and their baseline results. 

Conclusion: Cholecalciferol was shown to have beneficial effects on serum ALT levels, hsCRP levels and lipid profile of NAFLD patients. Clinical Trial Registration: https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/prs-users-guide.html, identifier NCT05613192.

#### NAFLD might be fought by D if the Vitamin D receptor is activated - Sept 2023

 **Insights into the role of vitamin D in targeting the culprits of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** 

Life Sci. 2023 Sep 22;122124. [doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122124](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122124) PDF is behind a paywall

Basma A Abdelrahman 1, Aiman S El-Khatib 2, Yasmeen M Attia 1

Vitamin D (VD) is a secosteroid hormone that is renowned for its crucial role in phospho-calcium homeostasis upon binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). Over and above, the pleiotropic immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic roles VD plays in different disease settings started to surface in the past few decades. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence suggests a correlation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive inflammatory form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with vitamin D deficiency (VDD) owing to the former's ingrained link with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Accordingly, a better understanding of the contribution of VDR signalling to NAFLD incidence and progression would provide further insights into its diagnosis, treatment modalities, and prognosis, especially since hitherto, no drug for NAFLD has been approved. This review, therefore, sought to set forth the likely contribution of VDR signalling in NAFLD and how it might influence its multiple drivers.
