#### PBM (multi-spectrum, pulsed and continous) decreased Macular Degeneration for 5 months –  RCT Aug 2020

 **A DOUBLE-MASKED, RANDOMIZED, SHAM-CONTROLLED, SINGLE-CENTER STUDY WITH PHOTOBIOMODULATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DRY AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION** 

Retina. 2020 Aug;40(8):1471-1482. [doi: 10.1097/IAE.0000000000002632.](https://doi.org/10.1097/IAE.0000000000002632.)

Purpose: The LIGHTSITE I study investigated the efficacy and safety of photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment in subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration.

Methods: Thirty subjects (46 eyes) were treated with the Valeda Light Delivery System, wherein subjects underwent two series of treatments (3× per week for 3-4 weeks) over 1 year. Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, microperimetry, central drusen volume and drusen thickness, and quality of life assessments.

Results: Photobiomodulation-treated subjects showed a best-corrected visual acuity mean letter score gain of 4 letters immediately after each treatment series at Month 1 (M1) and Month 7 (M7). Approximately 50% of PBM-treated subjects showed improvement of ≥5 letters versus 13.6% in sham-treated subjects at M1. High responding subjects (≥5-letter improvement) in the PBM-treated group showed a gain of 8 letters after initial treatment (P < 0.01) and exhibited earlier stages of age-related macular degeneration disease. Statistically significant improvements in contrast sensitivity, central drusen volume, central drusen thickness, and quality of life were observed (P < 0.05). No device-related adverse events were reported.

Conclusion: Photobiomodulation treatment statistically improved clinical and anatomical outcomes with more robust benefits observed in subjects with earlier stages of dry age-related macular degeneration. Repeated PBM treatments are necessary to maintain benefits. These pilot findings support previous reports and suggest the utility of PBM as a safe and effective therapy in subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration.

 **The "SHAM" used the same device at 1/100 the intensity  
Seems like it would be very easy/natural to notice the difference of 100 X in intensity**

#### Low-level laser therapy improves vision in patients with age-related macular degeneration - 2008

Photomed Laser Surg. 2008 Jun;26(3):241-5. [doi: 10.1089/pho.2007.2132.](https://doi.org/10.1089/pho.2007.2132.)

Ivandic BT1, Ivandic T.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study of a case series was to examine the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

BACKGROUND DATA: AMD affects a large proportion of the elderly population; current therapeutic options for AMD are limited, however.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

In total, 203 patients (90 men and 113 women; mean age 63.4 +/- 5.3 y) with beginning ("dry") or advanced ("wet") forms of AMD (n = 348 eyes) were included in the study. One hundred ninety-three patients (mean age 64.6 +/- 4.3 y; n = 328 eyes) with cataracts (n = 182 eyes) or without cataracts (n = 146 eyes) were treated using LLLT four times (twice per week). A semiconductor laser diode (780 nm, 7.5 mW, 292 Hz, continuous emission) was used for transconjunctival irradiation of the macula for 40 sec (0.3 J/cm2) resulting in a total dose of 1.2 J/cm2. Ten patients (n = 20 eyes) with AMD received mock treatment and served as controls. Visual acuity was measured at each visit. Data were analyzed retrospectively using a t-test.

RESULTS:

LLLT significantly improved visual acuity (p < 0.00001 versus baseline) in 162/182 (95%) of eyes with cataracts and 142/146  **(97%)**  of eyes without cataracts. The prevalence of metamorphopsia, scotoma, and dyschromatopsia was reduced. In patients with wet AMD, edema and bleeding improved. The improved vision was maintained for 3-36 mo after treatment. Visual acuity in the control group remained unchanged. No adverse effects were observed in those undergoing therapy.

CONCLUSION:

In patients with AMD, LLLT significantly improved visual acuity without adverse side effects and may thus help to prevent loss of vision.

 **Clipped from the discussion section** 

LLLT may increase cellular metabolism in choroidea, RPE, and in photoreceptors, where the energy is absorbed by pigments. Regular metabolic processes may be enhanced and repair processes may be triggered or accelerated. Recently, an increase in the expression of  **heat shock proteins**  was found in the retinal and choroidal layers after sub-thermal transpupillary application of laser energy. **Heat shock proteins**  (or chaperones) are known to stimulate cellular metabolism and may help prevent premature cell death.

 **[Heat Shock Proteins - Wikipedia 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_shock_protein)** 

* "Heat shock proteins (HSP) are a family of proteins that are produced by cells in response to exposure to stressful conditions. They were first described in relation to heat shock, but are now known to also be expressed during other stresses including exposure to cold, UV light,and during wound healing or tissue remodeling"

* "HSPs are found in virtually all living organisms, from bacteria to humans."
