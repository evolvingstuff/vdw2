* “Half of all women and every fifth man over the age of 50 are at risk for osteoporosis”

* “After the first one (fracture), you have five times the risk of another. With two or more, there’s 12 times the risk. It’s like a domino effect...”

* “While calcium supplements are widely available, they’re increasingly linked to side effects such as kidney stones, gas, constipation, high blood pressure and heart disease”

* “The key is to balance your calcium intake with your  **phosphorus**  intake, which is two to four times too high for most Americans”

   * “Meat and dairy, which are high in  **phosphorus** , should be limited. Instead. recipes should emphasize green leafy vegetables, beans and stews, fruits, seeds and nuts”
