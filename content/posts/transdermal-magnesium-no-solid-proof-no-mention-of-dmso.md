* This study was unable to find solid proof that transdermal Magnesium is better than oral

* The study was however, only looking for increases in Magnesium in the blood stream

* The study failed to consider the benefits of local Magnesium

In the following review, we evaluated the current literature and evidence-based data on transdermal magnesium application and show that the propagation of transdermal magnesium is scientifically unsupported. The importance of magnesium and the positive effects of magnesium supplementation are extensively documented in magnesium deficiency, e.g., cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. The effectiveness of oral magnesium supplementation for the treatment of magnesium deficiency has been studied in detail. However, the proven and well-documented oral magnesium supplementation has become questioned in the recent years through intensive marketing for its transdermal application (e.g., magnesium-containing sprays, magnesium flakes, and magnesium salt baths). In both, specialist and lay press as well as on the internet, there are increasing numbers of articles claiming the effectiveness and superiority of transdermal magnesium over an oral application. It is claimed that the transdermal absorption of magnesium in comparison to oral application is more effective due to better absorption and fewer side effects as it bypasses the gastrointestinal tract.

#### Transdermal Magnesium applied to non-athletes increased both serum and urine Mg levels - RCT April 2017

 **PLoS One.** 2017 Apr 12;12(4):e0174817. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0174817.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174817.) eCollection 2017.

Effect of transdermal magnesium cream on serum and urinary magnesium levels in humans: A pilot study.

Kass L1, Rosanoff A2, Tanner A1, Sullivan K1, McAuley W1, Plesset M2.

BACKGROUND:

Oral magnesium supplementation is commonly used to support a low magnesium diet. This investigation set out to determine whether magnesium in a cream could be absorbed transdermally in humans to improve magnesium status.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:

In this single blind, parallel designed pilot study, n = 25 participants (aged 34.3+/-14.8y, height 171.5+/-11cm, weight 75.9 +/-14 Kg) were randomly assigned to either a 56mg/day magnesium cream or placebo cream group for two weeks. Magnesium serum and 24hour urinary excretion were measured at baseline and at 14 days intervention. Food diaries were recorded for 8 days during this period. Mg test and placebo groups' serum and urinary Mg did not differ at baseline. After the Mg2+ cream intervention there was a clinically relevant increase in serum magnesium (0.82 to 0.89 mmol/l,p = 0.29) that was not seen in the placebo group (0.77 to 0.79 mmol/L), but was only statistically significant (p = 0.02)) in a subgroup of non-athletes. Magnesium urinary excretion increased from baseline slightly in the Mg2+ group but with no statistical significance (p = 0.48). The Mg2+ group showed an 8.54% increase in serum Mg2+ and a 9.1% increase in urinary Mg2+ while these figures for the placebo group were smaller, i.e. +2.6% for serum Mg2+ and -32% for urinary Mg2+. In the placebo group, both serum and urine concentrations showed no statistically significant change after the application of the placebo cream.

CONCLUSION:

No previous studies have looked at transdermal absorbency of Mg2+ in human subjects. In this pilot study, transdermal delivery of 56 mg Mg/day (a low dose compared with commercial transdermal Mg2+ products available) showed a larger percentage rise in both serum and urinary markers from pre to post intervention compared with subjects using the placebo cream, but statistical significance was achieved only for serum Mg2+ in a subgroup of non-athletes. Future studies should look at higher dosage of magnesium cream for longer durations.

#### How To Boost Your Magnesium Levels Without Pills or Capsules (review of PLOS One study)

 **[Nutritonal Mag.org](http://www.nutritionalmagnesium.org/transdermal-magnesium-absorption/)** 

Magnesium cream absorbed through skin significantly boosts magnesium levels in the blood, a study has found.

Research from the University of Herfordshire has revealed magnesium creams could be used as an alternative or in addition to oral supplements to combat major health problems including hypertension.

The first study into the effectiveness of magnesium creams on humans, published in the journal PLOS One, has found that topical application does boost magnesium levels in the blood.

An alternative, especially for people who have difficulties in taking pills, could be topical application through magnesium oils and trans-dermal creams, by which magnesium is absorbed through the skin.

Lindsy Kass at the University of Hertfordshire said: “This study is the first to look at the absorbency of trans-dermal magnesium creams in human subjects, so is a significant step in determining whether or not these creams could potentially be used as an alternative to oral supplements.

“Our initial findings indicate that magnesium creams could well be a viable and effective alternative to taking oral magnesium supplements in tablet form, although further studies are now needed to look at a higher dose of magnesium over a longer period of time.”

“Low magnesium intake has been shown to cause many health problems, including high blood pressure and cardiovascular issues, so these creams could potentially be a good way to contribute to the increase in magnesium levels and therefore help in reducing the associated health problems.”

“Many people do not like taking pills or have difficulty ingesting them, whereas a cream could be used easily on a daily basis, for example by rubbing it into the skin after showering.”

Lindsy Kass and Andrea Rosanoff from the Centre for Magnesium Education and Research in Hawaii, studied a group of healthy adults.

The research showed baseline urine and blood samples were taken and participants randomly assigned into magnesium cream or placebo control cream groups, then instructed to apply two x 5ml spoonfuls of cream per day for two weeks.

The resulting daily dose received in the magnesium cream group consisted of 56 mg.

After 12 to 14 days final urine and blood samples were collected and compared to the original findings.

After the magnesium cream intervention, researchers found an increase in magnesium levels in the blood not seen in the placebo group.

In particular for non-athletes in the group (exercise is known to deplete magnesium levels and a small number of the participants were undertaking regular high intensity training) there was a statistically significant rise in magnesium in the blood.
