* “The group again recommends against postmenopausal women taking 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium daily because there's no effect on fracture prevention (grade D). There was less certainty about higher doses (grade I).”

 **The USPSTF has finally noticed that quarterly and annual dosing of Vitamin D increases falls.**
