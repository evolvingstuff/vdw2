Introduction: COPD patients may be at increased risk for vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency, but risk factors for deficiency among COPD patients have not been extensively reported.

Methods: Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured by liquid chromatography double mass spectrometry in subjects aged 40–76 years from Western Norway, including 433 COPD patients (GOLD stage II-IV) and 325 controls. Levels &amp;lt;20 ng/mL defined deficiency. Season, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, GOLD stage, exacerbation frequency, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), respiratory symptoms, depression (CES-D score?16), comorbidities (Charlson score), treatment for osteoporosis, use of inhaled steroids, and total white blood count were examined for associations with 25(OH)D in both linear and logistic regression models.

Results: COPD patients had an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to controls after adjustment for seasonality, age, smoking and BMI. 
Variables associated with lower 25(OH)D levels in COPD patients were 
*obesity ( = ?6.63), 
*current smoking ( = ?4.02), 
*GOLD stage III- IV ( = ?4.71, = ?5.64), and
* depression ( = ?3.29). 
Summertime decreased the risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 0.22).

Conclusion: COPD was associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, and important disease characteristics were significantly related to 25(OH)D levels.

!!COPD 4X more likely among former smokers having low vitamin D – April 2012

!!Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, oral health and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
J Clin Periodontol. 2012 Apr;39(4):350-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2012.01852.x. Epub 2012 Feb 1.

AIM: To evaluate the associations of serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels with periodontal health and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 193 COPD patients and 181 controls. 
Their periodontal status and lung function were examined, and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured.

RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in the COPD group than in the controls (32.1 versus 35.8 nmol/l; p = 0.002). 
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively correlated with lung function among non-smokers and negatively correlated with plaque index (PLI) among former smokers. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, season and smoking status, periodontal indexes were significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations (number of remaining teeth among all groups; probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding index, PLI and alveolar bone loss among COPD group). 

Lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with an increased risk of COPD among former smokers (__Odd ratio 4.11__; 95% confidence interval 1.47-11.5; p = 0.007) after adjustment for periodontal indexes and other variables.

CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with poor periodontal health and an increased risk of COPD.
