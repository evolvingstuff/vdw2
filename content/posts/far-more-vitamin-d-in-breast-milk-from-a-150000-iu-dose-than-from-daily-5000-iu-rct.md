 **Comment by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki** 

* Bodies have been evolved to store vitamin D (not require daily sunshine)

* Many studies have found non-daily dosing of Vitamin D to acually produce better results than daily

* Intermittant dosing (up to 17 days) appears to provide the most benefit, but monthly dosing is OK

* <a href="/posts/take-vitamin-d3-daily-or-weekly" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2475">Take vitamin D3 daily or weekly</a> has the following chart

>  **Note: This chart unrealistically assumes 100% daily compliance** 

>  **Assuming a 80% daily compliance, the first column would be 20% shorter** 

 **Note:** 

* The women started with non-typical high levels of Vitamin D: 29 ng

* Mayo trial started in 2010 and ended in 2011

* Took till 2018 for these results to be published
