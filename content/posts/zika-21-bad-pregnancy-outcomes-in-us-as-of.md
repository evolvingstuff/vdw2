 **What these numbers show** 

* These numbers reflect poor outcomes among pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection reported to the US Zika Pregnancy Registry.

* The number of live-born infants and pregnancy losses with birth defects are combined for the 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories. To protect the privacy of the women and children affected by Zika, CDC is not reporting individual state, tribal, territorial or jurisdictional level data.

* The poor birth outcomes reported include those that have been detected in infants infected with Zika before or during birth, including microcephaly, calcium deposits in the brain indicating possible brain damage, excess fluid in the brain cavities and surrounding the brain, absent or poorly formed brain structures, abnormal eye development, or other problems resulting from damage to brain that affects nerves, muscles and bones, such as clubfoot or inflexible joints.

 **What these new numbers do not show** 

* These numbers are not real time estimates. They will reflect the outcomes of pregnancies reported with any laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection as of 12 noon every Thursday the week prior; numbers will be delayed one week.

* These numbers do not reflect outcomes among ongoing pregnancies.

* Although these outcomes occurred in pregnancies with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection, we do not know whether they were caused by Zika virus infection or other factors.

 **Note what the CDC DOES NOT SAY** 

1. How many poor outcomes are due to travel, vs local

1. How many of the live birth defects were microcephaly

1. Where the problems occurred – not even which state

1. How many of the losses were due to abortions

1. If there were even more pregnancy problems, but Zika had not suspected or identified

1. How many Zika pregnancies had good outcomes

> Note - there is very little reason to report a possible Zika pregnancy to CDC

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Reporting is costly in terms of both time and money

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing can be done if the report is positive

> &nbsp; &nbsp; A negative report could easliy be a false neagative
