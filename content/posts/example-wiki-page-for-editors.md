^ The boxes like this to show considerations for making a wiki page

This page starts with the above interesting graphic - which shows the "official looking title page from the PDF

The graphic is not expected to be used on other pages, so it was attached directly to this page, rather than uploaded to a File Gallery

This page has permissions set to "registered" - thus it does not bother the normal visitor

99.9% of the TikiWiki pages can be viewed by everyone

This page is an overview/teaser of a PDF file, which visitors might be reluctant to see

# Age 0-10 1000 IU

# Age 11+ 2000 IU

^The above puts the upper limit recommendations into IU from micrograms and reduces the number of ages.

It also provides text that Google can translate^

Note 3: It should be noted that the intake of vitamin D via food would add to synthesis caused by exposure to sunlight.

Depending on the amount of sunlight the risk of adverse effects at an intake at the upper level would increase. It

should also be noted that  **higher doses of vitamin D might be needed, particular in elderly,**  to achieve optimal

serum levels of 25(OH)D for purpose of optimal mineralisation of the skeleton. Such treatment should be under

medical surveillance.
