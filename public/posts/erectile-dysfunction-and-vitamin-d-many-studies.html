We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency or vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout causes ED and analysed the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Experimental approach: Erectile function was assessed in vivo in anaesthetized male mice or rats by evaluating intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and in vitro in male Vdr-/- mice, and rat or human isolated corpora cavernosa (CCs) mounted in a myograph. Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptomic analysis was performed in rat CCs. Vitamin D deficiency was induced in rats fed a vitamin D-free diet for 5 months.</p><p>Key results: CCs from human donors with low plasma vitamin D exhibited reduced nitric oxide (NO)-dependent erectile function. <strong>This ED was also reproduced in vitamin D-deficient rats and VDR knockout mice</strong> , in vivo and ex vivo, and is associated with penile fibrosis and reduced response to the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) sildenafil. CCs from deficient rats show increased superoxide levels, and their impaired erectile function was restored by superoxide scavengers. Transcriptomic analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot showed down-regulated secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (Slpi). Moreover, recombinant SLPI prevented superoxide-induced ED, while Slpi gene silencing led to reduced erectile function in a superoxide-dependent manner.</p><p>Conclusion and implications: Vitamin D deficiency or VDR knockout reduces erectile function. We suggest that this effect is mediated by increased superoxide levels and down-regulation of SLPI. Vitamin D deficiency might be an aetiological factor for vascular ED and for the therapeutic failure of PDE5i.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/erectile-dysfunction---rats-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=two-erectile-dysfunction-vs-vitamin-d-charts>Two Erectile Dysfunction vs Vitamin D charts</h4><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/ed-vs-d-chart.webp alt=image width=500>

The higher prevalence of both conditions in the elderly suggests a possible relationship between the two conditions. In addition, in vitro, animal, and human studies have revealed several mechanisms that may relate VDD to ED. The main mechanism by which vitamin D might exert its action on sexual function appears to be through the <strong>regulation of endothelial function</strong> . Indeed, VDD correlates with several markers of endothelial function. The action of vitamin D on the endothelium would be exercised both indirectly through its intervention in inflammatory processes and through the production of oxygen free radicals, and directly through the regulation of vascular stiffness, the production of nitric oxide, and the regulation of vessel permeability.</p><p>Furthermore, the ubiquitous distribution of the vitamin D receptor in the human body means that this hormone can also exert a beneficial effect on erectile function by interfering with those comorbidities significantly associated with ED, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, chronic kidney disease, and hypogonadism.</p><p>In this review, we thoroughly and carefully presented the evidence and mechanisms that would appear to relate vitamin D levels to erectile function. Furthermore, we have summarized the meta-analytic evidence for and against this association to provide a true representation of this topic.</p><p>Data published to date suggest that low levels of vitamin D could contribute to worsening erectile function through several mechanisms. Therefore, vitamin D levels should be measured in patients with ED and maintained at adequate levels by specific supplementation in case of deficiency. However, the low quality and heterogeneity of clinical trials evaluating the effects of vitamin D administration on erectile function and ED-associated comorbidities do not allow for a univocal conclusion, and indicate the need for further studies to analyze these aspects.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/association-vitamin-d-and-erectile-dysfunction-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=both-types-of-erectile-dysfunction--have-low-vitamin-d---dec-2022>Both types of erectile dysfunction have low Vitamin D - Dec 2022</h4><p><strong>The relationship between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D and arteriogenic erectile dysfunction</strong></p><p>Andrologia . 2022 Dec;54(11):e14568. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/and.14568>doi: 10.1111/and.14568</a> publisher rents PDF for $12</p><p>Xu Wu 1 , Yuyang Zhang 1 , Wei Zhang 1 , Guodong Liu 1 , Hui Jiang 2 , Houbao Huang 3 , Xiansheng Zhang 1</p><p>This study aimed to assess the relationship between 25(OH) levels and erectile dysfunction (ED), particularly arteriogenic ED (A-ED).

CalogeroORCID</p><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is found very frequently in the male population, in particular in its arteriogenic form, which also represents an important predictor of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Some evidence suggests that vitamin D could play a role in cardiovascular risk prevention thanks to its ability to reduce endothelial damage, oxidative stress, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and dyslipidemia. Since ED and CVDs have pathogenic mechanisms in common, numerous studies have evaluated a possible association between vitamin D deficiency (blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 20 ng/mL) and ED, but with conflicting results. This meta-analysis was therefore performed to clarify the discrepancy of the data so far published. To achieve this, articles have been searched extensively in the Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Academic One Files, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases from the first day they were created until January 2020. The search strategy included pertinent Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms. Of the 431 items retrieved, only eight observational studies were included, resulting in a total sample size of 4055 patients. It was found that 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25(OH)D) levels did not show any significant difference between patients with and without ED. However, when patients with vitamin D deficiency only were taken into account, the international index of erectile function (IIEF) score for erectile dysfunction was significantly worse than in controls. This association remained significant even when eugonadal-only patients were considered.</p><p>Finally, we found that eugonadal patients with severe ED have lower 25(OH)D3 levels than patients with mild ED. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests an association between vitamin D deficiency and the presence of severe forms of ED, independent of testicular function.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ed-meta-2020-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from sci-hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=ed-5-less-likely-for-each-1ng--more-of-vitamin-d---july-2020>ED 5% less likely for each 1ng more of vitamin D - July 2020</h4><p><strong>Novel predictive risk factor of erectile dysfunction: Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D</strong></p><p>Andrologia. 2020 Jul 29;e13767. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/and.13767>doi: 10.1111/and.13767</a></p><p>Mustafa Ozan Horsanalı 1, Huseyin Eren 2, Eyup Dil 2, Alper Caglayan 1, Ozgur Erdogan 1, Fatih Ekren 1</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ed-risk-factor-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from sci-hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/ed-table.jpg alt=image width=700><p>The present study aimed to investigate the association between the severity of erectile dysfunction (ED) and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D.

Patients were divided into three groups according to their scores on the international index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5) Turkish validated short form questionnaire. The serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D results were compared between the groups. The mean age of the patients was 49.28 ± 13.62 years. Groups 1, 2 and 3 included 44 (33.8%) patients with severe ED, 56 (43.1%) patients with moderate ED and 30 (23.1%) patients with mild ED, respectively.

We also summarize research indicating that VD associates with reduced risk of several nonvascular contributing factors for ED. Available literature demonstrates relatively high rates of low VD serum levels in ED patients. Based on the preclinical and clinical data available in the literature, to date, we infer that VD play a critical role in maintaining erectile function in humans. Nevertheless, this should also be tested through randomized controlled studies on the effect of VD supplementation with larger population.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ed-and-vit-d.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>Clipped from the PDF</span></strong></p><p>One mechanism linking low VD levels with ED may be via reduced synthesis of NO. Recently Barassi et al demonstrated a higher presence of VDD in arterial ED patients compared with non-arterial-ED patients and a lower serum VD levels in more severe ED patients.<sup>[18]</sup></p><p>Both observational and interventional studies have established the presence of an association between VD levels and ED. This relation is more than a simple relation, because there are many risk factors (Figure 2) in the etiology of ED which might be directly caused by VDD.</p><p><strong>Vitamin D and nitric oxide production</strong></p><p>Penis is a vascular organ, and erections have a vascular basis. NO pathway is known to mediate penile erection. NO is a physiologic signal essential for penile erection, and disorders that reduce NO synthesis or release in the erectile tissue are commonly associated with ED. Sexual stimulation releases neurotransmitters from the corpus cavernosa as well as NO from the endothelial cells of the penis.<sup>[17]</sup></p><p>Another important mechanism of action of VD seems to be via NO- mediated vascular dilation. NO synthases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the production of NO from L -arginine. Activated VD stimulates the production of substantial quantities of NOS and NO in macrophages produced in bone and in endothelial cells in response to tuberculosis. NO is vital to vascular dilation and thereby important for the inhibition of ED.<sup>[17]</sup> Because of the presence of VD and VDR in the endothelial cells and the pivotal role of NO and eNOS in the endothelial activity, it is conceivable that an interaction between VD and NO is capable of influencing vascular function.<sup>[51]</sup> Molinari et al.<sup>[51]</sup> demonstrated that VD is able to stimulate NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells through eNOS activation. The finding of an involvement of VD in NO production by endothelial cells is quite relevant. NO is an essential molecule and serves multiple functions including vasodilatation and many anti-atherogenic properties. Indeed, dysregulation of eNOS activity is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension.</p><p>Activated VD stimulates the production of NO in endothelial cells and NO synthases which catalyze the production of NO from L-arginine<sup>[51]</sup>, is a key to vascular dilation and thereby critical for the prevention of ED. Interestingly, the latter study showed that <strong>VD response occurs within seconds</strong> and, for this reason, it appears that VD has a non-genomic direct effect on endothelial cells. Recently, Andrukhova et al.<sup>[52]</sup> reported that VD receptor mutant mice are characterized by lower bioavailability of the vasodilator NO due to reduced expression of the key NO synthesizing enzyme i.e. eNOS. Reduction in eNOS ends with endothelial dysfunction, increased arterial stiffness, increased aortic impedance, structural remodeling of the aorta, and impaired systolic and diastolic heart function at advanced ages, independent of changes in the renin-angiotensin system.<sup>[52]</sup> The latter group demonstrated that VD is a direct transcriptional regulator of eNOS.<sup>[52]</sup> This may also clarify why endothelium derived, and NO-evoked dilation is reduced nearly 50% in arteries from VD deficient male rats.<sup>[16]</sup> Under the light of recent scientific researches, unsurprisingly, there exists a higher prevalence of ED among VD deficient patients compared to those with optimal levels.<sup>[9]</sup></p><hr><h4 id=erectile-dysfunction-is-13x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d---july-2016>Erectile dysfunction is 1.3X more likely if low vitamin D - July 2016</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with greater prevalence of erectile dysfunction:<br>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001–2004</strong></p><p>Atherosclerosis in press, doi:10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2016.07.921</p><p>Youssef M.K.

Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations have been associated with increased ASCVD risk, but less is known regarding the relationship of low 25(OH)D with ED. We determined whether 25(OH)D deficiency is associated with ED independent of ASCVD risk factors.</p><p>Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses of 3390 men aged ≥20 years free of ASCVD who participated in NHANES 2001–2004. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay; deficiency was defined as levels &lt;20 ng/ml (&lt;50 nmol/L). Self-reported ED, assessed by a single validated question, was defined as men who reported being “never” or “sometimes able” to maintain an erection. We assessed the relationship between 25(OH)D deficiency and ED prevalence using adjusted Poisson regression methods.</p><p>Results: After accounting for NHANES sampling, the weighted prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency and of ED were 30% and 15.2%, respectively. 25(OH)D levels were lower in men with vs. those without ED (mean 22.8 vs 24.3 ng/mL, respectively; p = 0.0005). After adjusting for lifestyle variables, comorbidities, and medication use, men with 25(OH)D deficiency had a higher prevalence of ED compared to those with levels ≥30 ng/ml (Prevalence Ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.08–1.57).</p><p>Conclusion: In this cross-sectional analysis of a representative sample of U.S. men, vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased prevalence of ED independent of ASCVD risk factors.

The pathophysiology of ED in diabetic men is multifactorial, but it mainly involves a vascular disorder related to a reduction of endothelial function. Recently, several studies have correlated ED risk factors with vitamin D deficiency. In this study, we evaluate the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels, erectile dysfunction, and vascular disease, in type 2 diabetes mellitus men (T2DM). In this observational study, 92 T2DM males (58.83 ± 9.73 years) underwent medical history collection, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire, that allows the identification and grading of DE, physical examination, biochemical/hormonal blood tests, and penile echo-color Doppler ultrasonography. T2DM patients with lower 25(OH)D levels (&lt;25 nmol/l) showed higher penile IMT (p &lt; 0.05), waist circonference (p &lt; 0.05), glucose concentrations (p &lt; 0.05), and lower IIEF-5 score (p &lt; 0.005), testosterone concentrations (p &lt; 0.05), and cavernous peak systolic velocity (PSV) (p &lt; 0.05), compared to patients with 25(OH)D >50 nmol/l. 25(OH)D levels were directly correlated with IIEF-5 (R = 0.39; p = 0.0001), testosterone (R = 0.24; p = 0.02), and PSV (R = 0.24; p = 0.04) and inversely with waist (R = −0.33; p = 0.002), HbA1c (R = −0.22; p = 0.03), triglyceride (R = −0.21; p = 0.06), and penile IMT (R = −0.30; p = 0.009). <strong>At multivariate analysis, 25(OH)D deficiency remained an independent predictor of DE</strong> . We demonstrate a significant association between 25(OH)D deficiency and erectile dysfunction in T2DM men. This association may be due to the influence of 25(OH)D deficiency on cardiovascular risk factor (glycaemia, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), testosterone plasma levels and endothelial dysfunction.</p><hr><h5 id=erectile-dysfunction-is-an-early-indicator-of-heart-problems-both-associated-with-low-vitamin-d---nov-2023>Erectile Dysfunction is an early indicator of Heart problems (both associated with low Vitamin D) - Nov 2023</h5><p><strong><a href="https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/266480/mens-health/easy-way-talk-about-penises?ecd=WNL_EVE_231113_mdedge">The easy way to talk about penises</a> MDEdge</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/ed-scale.png alt=image width=800><ul><li><p>&ldquo;I tell them it’s a 4-number scale.</p><ul><li><p>A “1” is no erection at all.</p></li><li><p>A “2” is when it gets harder and larger, but it’s not going to penetrate.</p></li><li><p>A “3” will penetrate, but it’s pretty wobbly.</p></li><li><p>A “4” is that perfect cucumber–porn star erection that everyone is seeking.</p></li><li><p>I have the patient tell me a story.
