#### Omega-3 treats NAFLD in children – meta-analysis Dec 2016

 **Omega-3 fatty acids as a treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children:   
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials** 

Clinical Nutrition, online 23 December 2016

 **Results** : In total, 4 studies with 263 subjects were identified. PUFA supplementation was associated with  **significantly improved hepatic steatosis grade**  on ultrasound (risk difference: 25%, 95% CI: 12–38%), without heterogeneity (P = 0.27, I2 = 24%). 

Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings. 

PUFA supplementation could decrease AST levels after 6 months, but could only  **reduce ALT levels after 12 months** . 

PUFA did not have a significant effect on most components of metabolic syndrome and the CRP level.

#### Omega-3 treats NAFLD – meta-analysis Aug 2017

 **The effect of omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease:   
A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs** 

Le Yu1, Man Yuan2, Linchun Wans3

Objective: During the treatment of diseases such as angiocardiopathy, blood lipid abnormalities and metabolic syndrome, omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can reduce plasma lipids and improve cardiovascular status, thus ameliorating disease severity. We aimed to explore the effects of PUFA supplementation in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed during March 2016 for randomized controlled trials using PUFA or fish oil supplementation in patients with NAFLD or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). All Randomized controlled trials were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE database up to date (March 2016). A meta-analysis of key outcomes (serum level of liver enzymes and lipids) were identified in these studies. The mean difference (MD) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as measures of effect size.

Results: Thirteen studies were included, consisting of 266 patients in the PUFA group and 402 cases in the control group. Serum level of alanine aminotransferase ( **ALT** ) was lower in the PUFA group than that in in the controls <span>[MD=-9.18, 95% CI (-12.41, -5.96), P <0.00001]</span>. However, PUFA treatment did not affect aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <span>[MD=-5.07, 95% CI (-12.65, 2.51), P= 0.19]</span>, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) <span>[MD=-1.91, 95% CI (-4.15, 0.33), P <0.009]</span>.

Conclusions: PUFA supplementation may affect serum level of ALT and improve liver function in patients with NAFLD.
