#### Jaundice Summary

* Jaundice is more common in breastfed infants (Breastfed infants have very low vitamin D)

* A typical jaundice treatment is phototherapy - typically without UVB which makes vitamin D

* Sometimes Vitamin D is used to treat jaundice

* Autism (which is probably associated with low vitamin D)  has been linked to jaundice

* Wonder if jaundice is also associated with premature births - which typically have low vitamin D

* Wonder if phototherapy for Seasonal Affective Disorder is similar to that for jaundice

> &nbsp; &nbsp; in both cases the phototherapy does not REQUIRE UV (Vitamin D)

 **Jaundice is associated with Vitamin D: caused by low D and cleared up with high vitamin D/sunlight** 

[Autism linked to jaundice in newborns, study finds](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39580262/ns/health-kids_and_parenting)

Use phototherapy to reduce the problem that 5% of babies have, and 5% of those (0.25%) got psychological disorders, including autism.

versus 0.1% of all babies got autism.  Net 67% more likely to get autism if had jaundice

 **Comparison between maternal and neonatal serum vitamin D levels in term jaundiced and nonjaundiced cases** 

Journal of the Chinese Medical Association.  online 12 September 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2016.05.008

Background: Neonatal jaundice is the result of an imbalance between the production and conjugation of bilirubin. Considering the multiple roles of vitamin D, lower levels of vitamin D in these cases may be associated with neonatal jaundice. The present study was undertaken for the purpose of comparing serum vitamin D levels in healthy term jaundiced and nonjaundiced newborns and their mothers.

Methods: This case–control study was conducted in 60 term newborns and their mothers from a teaching and referral children’s hospital in the southwestern region of Iran, from December 22, 2013 through March 22, 2014. Neonatal and maternal blood samples were obtained and sent to the laboratory.

Results: The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of newborns and their mothers in both the case and the control groups were not significantly associated with their serum bilirubin levels. The mean of laboratory indices (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphates, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxy vitamin D) in mothers and newborns of the case group were nonsignificantly higher than that of the control group, but the mean vitamin D level was significantly lower among newborn cases compared with the controls (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Newborn vitamin D levels were significantly lower in jaundiced cases compared with those in the nonjaundiced healthy groups, which may reveal an association between indirect hyperbilirubinemia and serum vitamin D levels. We suggest that more studies should be conducted including follow-up after 15 days of age, when jaundice has typically been resolved, and before starting vitamin D supplementation.

> clipp- - - Jaundice  is very common, occurring in around 60% of newborn babies during their first week of life. This figure rises to 80% in pre-term babies (babies born early). Jaundice is more common in babies who are breastfed, and around 10% of breastfed babies will still have jaundice when they are one month old. 

* [Jaundice is fairly common - especially breastfed](http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html/jaundice.shtml)

> clipped - - - Nearly all infants are jaundiced to some degree. In the vast majority of cases, newborn jaundice is a normal process, which many researchers feel may even serve protective functions, such as guarding the infant from the effects of oxygen free radicals. It makes sense that something that occurs in the majority of babies so routinely may be part of nature's plan for the human infant.  also talks about late-onset breastfeeding Jaundice

The light changes the shape and structure of bilirubin molecules in such a way that they can be excreted in the urine and stool.  **The light isn't an ultraviolet light** , and a protective plastic shield filters out any ultraviolet light that may be emitted."

> "Newborn Jaundice Treatment: Significant jaundice is often treated with phototherapy. This involves placing the baby on a warmer beneath special lights. These lights are able to penetrate a baby's skin and affect the bilirubin within the child. The light changes bilirubin into lumirubin, which is easily handled by the baby's body. This treatment may seem much like a visit to a local tanning booth. Special goggles or a shade is placed over the baby's eyes to shield them from the lights."

> Note - this appears to use a UV light, vs Mayo Clinic and below do not use UV

> "Breastfeeding — Jaundice is common in infants who are breastfed because of two different reasons"

> " **Phototherapy**  — Phototherapy ("light" therapy) is the most common medical treatment for jaundice in newborns. In most cases, phototherapy is the only treatment required. It consists of exposing an infant's skin to blue light, which breaks bilirubin down into parts that are easier to eliminate in the stool and urine. Treatment with phototherapy using special blue lights, such as blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), is successful for almost all infants.

 **Personal Communication: Triple antibiotic drug combination to treat [Leprosy](/posts/vitamin-d-is-treating-and-preventing-leprosy-in-myanmar-burma) resulted in Jaundice - so treatment was stopped (July 2019)** 

The person was then treated with 50,000 IU of vitamin D for two days

Also used Zinc, B12 B6 folate Non flush Niacin and Boron

Temperature normalized and the person was able to eat again in 2 days
