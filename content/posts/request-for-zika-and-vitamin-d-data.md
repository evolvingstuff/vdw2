#### <span style="color:#F00;">You may be able to prevent thousands of Zika related birth defects.</span>

We are writing to you because we believe that supplementing with sufficient Vitamin D may be able to strengthen immune systems in pregnant women enough to prevent Zika birth defects.

Vitamin D has been <a href="/posts/studied-and-proven" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 7538">studied and proven</a> to effectively counter similar viruses.

If healthy vitamin D levels can protect pregnant mothers and their unborn babies against Zika then a very low cost treatment program would be available for millions at risk.

We are looking for your data to prove or disprove this hypothesis.

We need Vitamin D measurements for at least 100 symptomatic plus 100 asymptomatic adults of either sex that have tested positive for Zika.

Weâ€™re asking for your help, in three possible ways:

&nbsp; &nbsp;   1) You can provide that data from your own research

&nbsp; &nbsp;    2) You know of a study or studies which have that data

&nbsp; &nbsp;   3) You know someone else who might have that data

If you can help, please respond or forward this email to someone who might have the data.

Time is of the essence. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Henry Lahore hlahore@gmail.com 360-301-9413
