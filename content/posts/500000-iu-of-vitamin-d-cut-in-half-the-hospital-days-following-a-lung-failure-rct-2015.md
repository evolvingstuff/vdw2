### A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of High-Dose Vitamin D in Lung Failure,

Rationale: Immune dysfunction and nosocomial infections are important contributors to short-term and long-term survival after critical illness. Cost-effective adjunctive therapies that can be rapidly implemented to improve the host response are imperative. It is now well established that vitamin D has pleotrophic effects on immune cells by upregulation of antimicrobial peptides, (e.g. LL-37). 

Methods: We completed a double blind, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two doses of vitamin D3 (total 250,000 IU or 500,000 IU over 5 days,) versus placebo in adult critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Our purpose was to determine whether high-dose vitamin D3 would increase plasma 25(OH)D and LL-37 levels (measured by chemiluminescence and ELISA, respectively) without adverse effects and whether this would improve clinical outcomes <span>[hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, SOFA score, hospital infection rate]</span>.

Results: 31 subjects were enrolled and completed the treatment protocol. Mean age was 62.9, 61% male, 47% Black, 42% surgical patients, 43% infection on admission, mean APACHE I I score 22.4 and mean SOFA 7.6. These were equally balanced across all groups except for race. Aggregated mean values of 25 (OH)D and LL-37 were greater with Vitamin D3 treatment. (Table 1)
