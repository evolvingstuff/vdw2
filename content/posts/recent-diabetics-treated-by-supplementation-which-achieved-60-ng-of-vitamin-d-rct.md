### A randomised controlled trial of high dose vitamin D in recent-onset type 2 diabetes.

Supplementation with 6,000 IU for 6 months

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Baseline  | 3 months | 6 months |
| Vitamin D  | 24 ng   | 60 ng  | 51 ng |
| fasting plasma glucose |  | -0.4 | 0 vs placebo |
| post-prandial blood glucose |  | -.3 <br>placebo +0.8 | 0 vs placebo |

 **Why?** 

1. 60 ng helped, but later 50 ng did not

1. Vitamin D drop from month 3 to month 6

> Do not recall seeing this in RCT with other diseases

* Perhaps something changed in the gut which reduced the bio-availability

> Example: chime spend less time in the gut in months 3-6 ==> less absoption of vitamin D

* Perhaps the trial was run during a single year and the last 3 months were during the winter - when D levels normally drops

* If the vitamin D supplementation had been raised in months 3-6 would the benefits would have been maintained?

AIMS:

Vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with impaired pancreatic beta-cell function. We aimed to determine if high dose oral vitamin D3 (D) improves beta-cell function and glycaemia in type 2 diabetes.

METHODS:

Fifty adults with type 2 diabetes diagnosed less than 12 months, with normal baseline serum 25-OH D (25D), were randomised to 6000IU D (n=26) or placebo (n=24) daily for 6 months. Beta-cell function was measured by glucagon-stimulated serum C-peptide (delta C-peptide <span>[DCP]</span>, nmol/l). Secondary outcome measures were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial blood glucose (PPG), HbA1c and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

RESULTS:

In the D group, median serum 25D (nmol/l) increased from 59 to 150 (3 months) and 128 (6 months) and median serum 1,25D (pmol/l) from 135 to 200 and 190. After 3 months, change in DCP from baseline in D (+0.04) and placebo (-0.08) was not different (P=0.112). 

However, change in FPG (mmol/l) was significantly lower in D (-0.40) compared to placebo (+0.1) (P=0.007), as was the change in PPG in D (-0.30) compared to placebo (+0.8) (P=0.005). Change in HbA1c (%) between D (-0.20) and placebo (-0.10) was not different (P=0.459). At 6 months, changes from baseline in DCP, FPG, PPG and HbA1c were not different between groups.

CONCLUSION:

Oral D3 supplementation in type 2 diabetes was associated with transient improvement in glycaemia, but without a measurable change in beta-cell function this effect is unlikely to be biologically significant. High dose D3 therefore appears to offer little or no therapeutic benefit in type 2 diabetes.
