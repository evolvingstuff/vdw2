## Overview of DVD by Thomas Braun

 **Hello Sunshine**  video on Vitamin D focuses on the history of why 3 out of 4 Americans are deficient on Vitamin D and also explores  with presentations from Dr. Garland and Dr. Heaney who have devoted their medical career in researching the Vitamin D deficiency issue and what has to be done to reverse this medical travesty.  Scientists now know that over 2700 genes require Vitamin D for normal biological function.  Vitamin D deficiencies help contribute to the expression of different disease states and the impact on cancer and other major disease states is addressed.

He believes that Big Pharma, the FDA and Obamacare has lost their compass. 

He has made a web page showing how you can have a healthy long life thru nutrients and nutrition (N2) and exercise (E). <span>[www.n2e4u.com]</span> 

He may, in the future, upload the video to the web for easy/free access by anyone around the world.

Note: I have ordered for the video but have not yet seen it. The DVD was made in 2010.
