The author&rsquo;s cautious conclusions reflect the limitations of the data and appear to be appropriate.</p><p>Authors&rsquo; objectives: To assess the effectiveness of vitamin D in dental caries prevention.</p><p>Searching</p><p>The following databases were searched up to January 2011: JSTOR, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Search strategies were reported in a separate online appendix. Three reference works on dental caries and relevant text books were also searched.</p><p>Study selection</p><p>Controlled clinical trials that evaluated supplemental dietary vitamin D or ultraviolet radiation and included a concurrent control group were eligible for inclusion. Eligible trials had to report the incident caries counts and follow-up time; they also had to assign vitamin D under control of the investigators for the purpose of prevention. Trials of salivary or microbiological surrogates of caries were excluded, as were retrospective studies and cross-sectional studies. Trials where vitamin D assignment was based on medical need were also excluded. The outcome of interest was the incidence of dental caries.</p><p>Most included trials evaluated vitamin D3 with a median dose of 800 IU or vitamin D2 with a median dose of 3,750 IU; detailed information on the calculation of vitamin D doses was reported in the paper. A small number of trials evaluated ultraviolet radiation. The included trials recruited either children or young adults; <strong>most trials were conducted between the first and the second world wars</strong> . The age of participants ranged from two to 16 years. Trials usually recruited both girls and boys, but four trials only recruited either girls or boys. Participants had either an unspecified diet or a mineralising diet, which complemented the vitamin D supplementation. Most caries counts were reported at a tooth level or a surface level, with caries data primarily based on permanent teeth or permanent teeth combined with primary teeth. Most trials were conducted in institutional-based or school-based settings; some were conducted in practice-based or hospital-based settings. Included trials were conducted in the USA, UK, Canada, Austria, New Zealand and Sweden.</p><p>The authors did not report how many reviewers assessed studies for inclusion.</p><p>Assessment of study quality</p><p>The quality of trials was assessed using the 21-item Downs and Black instrument.

A summary quality score was assigned to each trial.</p><p>The authors did not state how many reviewers performed quality assessment.</p><p>Data extraction</p><p>Data were extracted on event rates to calculate relative risks with 95% confidence intervals.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of individual trials on overall results.</p><p>Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger’s test.</p><p>Results of the review</p><p>Twenty-four controlled clinical trials were included in the review (2,827 participants). The quality score ranged from 6 to 21 (mean 14.8). Three trials used random assignment. Eleven trials were cluster-randomised. Non-comparability in baseline caries score between intervention and control groups was present in four trials. There was a lack of outcome assessor blinding in nineteen trials. Fourteen trials did not use placebo as control. The median drop-out rate was 47% (where reported).The median duration of follow-up was 12 months.</p><p>Supplemental vitamin D was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of dental caries compared with no supplement (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.65; 38 comparisons).

A number of relevant databases were searched. Efforts were made to find unpublished studies, but assessment of publication bias indicated that this bias was present.

It was unclear whether sufficient attempts were made to minimise errors and biases during the review process.</p><p>Appropriate criteria were used to assess trial quality; most trials were subject to risk of bias (particularly the high risk for attrition bias). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed; it indicated a highly significant heterogeneity for the pooled outcomes.

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of controlled clinical trials (CCTs) assessing the impact of vitamin D on dental caries prevention. Random-effects and meta-regression models were used to evaluate overall and subgroup-specific relative-rate estimates. Twenty-four CCTs encompassing 2,827 children met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two of the 24 CCTs predated modern clinical trial design, some of which nonetheless reported characteristics such as pseudo-randomization (n = 2), blinding (n = 4), or use of placebos (n = 8). The relative-rate estimates of the 24 CCTs exhibited significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.0001), and there was evidence of significant publication bias (P &lt; 0.001). The pooled relative-rate estimate of supplemental vitamin D was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.43-0.65). No robust differences were identified between the caries-preventive effects of vitamin D(2) , vitamin D(3) , and ultraviolet radiation (Prob > F = 0.22). The analysis of CCT data identified vitamin D as a promising caries-preventive agent, leading to a low-certainty conclusion that vitamin D may reduce the incidence of caries.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>child</span>
