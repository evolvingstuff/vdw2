## Perrysburg – A mecca for Heliotherapy

American Journal of Health (NY) Sept 1926  attached at bottom of this page

Have the sick children outdoors – even in the winter!

 **Clipped from the PDF** 

In summer the children play and frolic over the extensive hay fields and woodlands. In winter, with only the protection of a loin cloth, they ski, coast and toboggan on the snow covered farm hills—their delicate, sick bodies in the meantime being rebuilt and hardened by exposure to the direct sunlight.

### Heliotherapy in Denver ( 5,000 foot altitude results in LOTS of UVB which produces vitamin D)

 **History of Heliotherapy (as of Aug 2014)** 

Many ancient cultures practiced various forms of heliotherapy, including people of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Rome.<sup>[48]</sup> 

The Inca, Assyrian and early German settlers also worshipped the sun as a health bringing deity. 

Indian medical literature dating to 1500 BC describes a treatment combining herbs with natural sunlight to treat non-pigmented skin areas. 

Buddhist literature from about 200 AD and 10th-century Chinese documents make similar references.

The Faroese physician Niels Finsen is believed to be the father of modern phototherapy. He developed the first artificial light source for this purpose.<span>[citation needed]</span> Finsen used red light to treat lupus vulgaris, a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and ultraviolet light to treat smallpox lesions. He received the  **Nobel Prize**  in Physiology or Medicine in 1903. Scientific evidence for some of his treatments is lacking, and later eradication of smallpox and development of antibiotics for tuberculosis rendered light therapy obsolete for these diseases.<sup>[49]</sup>

Since then a large array of treatments using controlled light have been developed. Though the popular consumer understanding of "light therapy" is associated with treating seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm disorders and skin conditions like psoriasis, other applications include the use of low level laser, red light, near-infrared and ultraviolet lights for pain management, hair growth,<span>[citation needed]</span> skin treatments,<span>[which?]</span> and accelerated wound healing.<span>[citation needed]</span>

#### Then they got the idea of having TB patients get their sun thru windows - which blocks UVB
