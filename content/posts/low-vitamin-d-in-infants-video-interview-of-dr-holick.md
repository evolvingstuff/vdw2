#### A few notes of the video

 **[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/) (EDS) 1 in 5,000 people** 

EDS results in hypermobility of joints and skin

If one parent has EDS then 50% chance that the infant will have EDS

If two parents have EDS then 75% chance in infant

No DNA test  (yet) for EDS

EDS very dangerous if also have low vitamin D. Looks like broken bones due to child abuse

[EDS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes) 13 types of EDS as of 2017

 **Best source of Calcium**   Milk or yogurt (especially if lactose intolerant - also TUMS)

 **No need to test, very low cost, just supplement** 

 **If mother minimally took prenatal Vitamins (400 IU) highly likely that both mother and infant will be deficient** 

 **Legs can be bowed out or bowed in with Rickets** 

 **Head sweating in infant is a good sign of low vitamin D** 

 **Infant can bruise easily with rickets**

#### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome - 2024

Endocrine Abstracts (2024) 99 EP545 | DOI: 10.1530/endoabs.99.EP545

Background : Ehlers–Danlos syndrome encompasses a group of genetic conditions characterized by alterations in connective tissue structure, with the consequent increased risk of developing osteopenia, osteoporosis, and incurring fractures. Maintaining vitamin D levels within normal limits is known to play an important role in preventing these complications, which seems to be particularly important in patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. The purpose of this study was to assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, levels in women with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

Material and methods: The study involved a prospective assessment of 30 female patients, aged 20–53 years, with hypermobile or classical Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. All patients underwent calcium and phosphorus metabolism testing and bone mineral density (BMD) scans of the femoral neck and lumbar spine. The patients were divided into two groups: those with vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum 25(OH)D levels of < 30 ng/ml (group 1, n=18) and those with normal (> 30 ng/ml) 25(OH)D levels (group 2, n=12).

Results: Eighteen patients (60%) showed vitamin 25(OH)D deficiency, with three of those (16.7%) showing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Study groups 1 and 2 showed no significant differences in terms of serum levels of calcium (2.4±0.09 mmol/l vs 2.39±0.07 mmol/l, P=0.88), phosphorus (3.51±0.7 mg/dl vs 3.42±0.51 mg/dl, P=0.86), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (10.36±3.06 µg/l vs 8.28±1.31 µg/l, P=0.007), beta-CrossLaps (0.39±0.19 ng/ml vs 0.39±0.17 ng/ml, P=0.69), or osteocalcin (20.14±8 ng/ml vs 21.23±6.67 ng/ml, P=0.46), femoral neck BMD (0.95±0.12 g/cm2 vs 0.92±0.13 g/cm2, P=0.57), or lumbar spine BMD (0.12±0.16 g/cm2 vs 0.13±0.11 g/cm2, P=0.14).

Conclusions: **Sixty percent of patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome showed vitamin 25(OH)D deficiency** . Parameters of calcium–phosphorus metabolism in these patients were not significantly different from those in patients with normal serum vitamin 25(OH)D levels.
