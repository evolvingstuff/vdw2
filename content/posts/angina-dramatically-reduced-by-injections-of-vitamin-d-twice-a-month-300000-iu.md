Aims: The aim of present study was to assess whether vitamin D, with proven beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, has any effect on angina and exercise-induced ischemia in patients with cardiac syndrome X and low serum vitamin D.

Methods: Patients with cardiac syndrome X and low serum vitamin D3 were studied before and after treatment with an intramuscular injection of vitamin D3 (300,000 units, every other week for 2 months). We determined the angina episode (per day) and several indices of exercise capacity.

Results: At the end of the treatment course (75±6 day), 

* a significant increase of serum vitamin D3 occurred and was within the normal range (45±8 ng/ml) and 

* the frequency of angina improved significantly (p=0.003). 

* Exercise duration and maximal work capacity increased significantly (p<0.001). 

* Maximal ST-segment depression (mm) decreased significantly (p=0.001). 

* The calculated Duck treadmill score improved significantly (p=0.001).

Conclusions: Our findings show that vitamin D replacement therapy in patients with cardiac syndrome X and vitamin D deficiency dramatically improves symptoms and signs of ischemia.
