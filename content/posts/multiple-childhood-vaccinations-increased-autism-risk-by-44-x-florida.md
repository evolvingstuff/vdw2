##### Dose dependant:  more vaccination visits lead to an increased risk of Autism

##### 89% of the Medicaid Children had 1 to 17 vaccinations (11% had no vaccinations)

##### Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders are even more associated with vaccination

Background: Vaccinations required for school attendance have increased nearly threefold since the 1950s, now targeting 17 infectious diseases. However, the impact of the expanded schedule on children's overall health remains uncertain. Preliminary studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children have reported that the vaccinated are significantly more likely than the unvaccinated to be diagnosed with bacterial infections, allergies, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The objective of this study was to determine the association between vaccination and NDDs in 9-year-old children enrolled in the Medicaid program. The specific aims were to test the hypothesis that: 

* 1) vaccination is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other NDDs; 

* 2) preterm birth coupled with vaccination increases the odds of NDDs compared to preterm birth without vaccination; and 

* 3) increasing numbers of vaccinations are associated with increased risks of ASD. 

Methods: The study population comprised children born and continuously enrolled in the Florida State Medicaid program from birth to age 9. Vaccination uptake was measured by numbers of healthcare visits that included vaccination-related procedures and diagnoses. Cross-sectional analyses were performed to calculate prevalence odds ratios (Aims 1-2). A retrospective cohort design was used to compute relative risks specifically of ASD (Aim 3).

Results: The analysis of claims data for 47,155 nine-year-old children revealed that: 

* 1) vaccination was associated with significantly increased odds for all measured NDDs; 

* 2) among children born preterm and vaccinated, 39.9% were diagnosed with at least one NDD compared to 15.7% among those born preterm and unvaccinated (OR 3.58, 95% CI: 2.80, 4.57); and 

* 3) the relative risk of ASD increased according to the number of visits that included vaccinations. 

Children with just one vaccination visit were 1.7 times more likely to have been diagnosed with ASD than the unvaccinated (95% CI: 1.21, 2.35) whereas those with 11 or more visits were 4.4 times more likely to have been diagnosed with ASD than those with no visit for vaccination (95% CI: 2.85, 6.84).

Conclusions: These results suggest that the current vaccination schedule may be contributing to multiple forms of NDD; that vaccination coupled with preterm birth was strongly associated with increased odds of NDDs compared to preterm birth in the absence of vaccination; and increasing numbers of visits that included vaccinations were associated with increased risks of ASD.

##### By age 10, a child in Florida typically receives 17 vaccinations

4-5 doses of DTaP, &nbsp; &nbsp; 4-5 doses of IPV (Polio), &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 doses of MMR

3 doses of Hepatitis B, &nbsp; &nbsp;2 doses of Varicella, &nbsp; &nbsp; Multiple doses of Hib and PCV

---

#### 5+ possible explanations

1. The immune system is unable to recover from concurrent vaccinations (depleted Vitamin D)

1. Problems with an ingredient in some vaccines e.g. aluminum

> &nbsp; [CDC funded study: 1.3 X Asthma risk if vaccination contained aluminum – Sept 2022](/posts/cdc-funded-study-13-x-asthma-risk-if-vaccination-contained-aluminum)

1. Risk increases only if the vaccine gets into the bloodstream

1. Risk increases only if low Vitamin D 

1. Risk only increases with vaccinations before - perhaps age 3

#### Wonder how many conformation studies will be published in major journals within a few years?

The data has been available in 50 states and scores of hospital electronic record systems

The problem has been the risk of getting his license revoked if he published the data
