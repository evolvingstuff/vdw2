However, emerging scientific research has revealed a surprisingly positive and overlooked environmental factor on health: direct physical contact with the vast supply of electrons on the surface of the Earth. Modern lifestyle separates humans from such contact. The research suggests that this disconnect may be a major contributor to physiological dysfunction and unwellness. Reconnection with the Earth&rsquo;s electrons has been found to promote intriguing physiological changes and subjective reports of well-being. Earthing (or grounding) refers to the discovery of benefits—including better sleep and reduced pain—from walking barefoot outside or sitting, working, or sleeping indoors connected to conductive systems that transfer the Earth&rsquo;s electrons from the ground into the body. This paper reviews the earthing research and the potential of earthing as a simple and easily accessed global modality of significant clinical importance.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/earthing-2012-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=earthing-review-with-useful-chart---may-2020>Earthing review with useful chart - May 2020</h4><p><strong>Integrative and lifestyle medicine strategies should include Earthing (grounding): Review of research evidence and clinical observations</strong></p><p>EXPLORE Volume 16, Issue 3 , May–June 2020, Pages 152-160 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2019.10.005>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2019.10.005</a></p><p>Wendy Menigoz a, Tracy T.

Such effects are profound, systemic, and foundational, and often develop rapidly. Earthing is as simple as routinely walking barefoot outdoors and/or using inexpensive grounding systems indoors while sleeping or sitting, practices that restore a lost and needed electric connection with the Earth. Some 20 studies to date have reported intriguing evidence of wide and significant physiological improvements when the body is grounded vs. non-grounded. The research, along with numerous anecdotal reports, demonstrates that Earthing clearly deserves inclusion in the clinical practice of preventive, alternative, and lifestyle medicine and has great potential to render these approaches more effective.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/earthing-review-2020-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=what-were-the-main-findings-of-the-double-blind-earthing-studies---asked-perplexity-ai-sept-2024httpswwwperplexityaisearchhave-any-earthing-trials-tried-q8z8kupt96mqm5rwnlg>What were the main findings of the double-blind earthing studies? - Asked <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/have-any-earthing-trials-tried-q8z8k.UPT96mQM5Rw..nlg>Perplexity AI Sept 2024</a></h4><p>According to the search results, several double-blind studies have found significant effects of earthing (grounding) compared to sham grounding:</p><ol><li><p>One double-blind study found that during 40 minutes of grounding, subjects&rsquo; respiratory rate, respiratory rate variance, blood oxygenation variance, and heart rate were significantly different compared to sham grounding control sessions.</p></li><li><p>Another double-blind study found that compared to sham grounding control sessions, one hour of grounding while relaxing in a recliner chair resulted in significant improvements in pleasant and positive moods, even though participants didn&rsquo;t know when they were receiving real grounding.</p></li><li><p>In a blinded experiment, grounding prevented a rise in creatine kinase, a marker of muscle damage, in the days following eccentric exercises, compared to sham grounding.</p></li><li><p>A double-blind study measured various physiological parameters while subjects were grounded for two hours.

During the period when this research was getting started, approximately 2000 to the present, scientists from around the world were establishing connections between inflammation and virtually all chronic diseases (Table 1) using the c-reactive protein assay developed by Ridker and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School. This article reviews Earthing, a safe therapy that optimizes (balances) each person&rsquo;s unique physiological functions; and that provides relief from the major diseases of the aging population; and that may slow the aging process itself. This statement is made because of the recognition that cumulative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS), sometimes referred to as free radicals, is one of the most widely studied theories of the cause of aging. Because the continuous semiconducting fabric of the body reaches into every part of the body, including the interiors of all cells and their nuclei, mobile electrons in the grounded or earthed person are thought to be capable of rapidly neutralizing ROS produced by oxidative metabolism taking place in every cell and tissue.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/illnesses-if-not-earthed-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><h5 id=17-improvements-from-earthing>17 improvements from Earthing</h5><ol><li><p>Improved sleep <sup>[30]</sup>.

is not optimum. The compromised immune system makes premature infants susceptible to micro-bacterial infections. Acute respiratory infection is the most common infection among them. This study aimed to investigate the significant difference in the length of acute respiratory infection before and after Earthing therapy. This research is a quasi-experimental study. The location is Sukoharjo District, Indonesia, from March to August 2021. The population in this study is preterm infants whose data is obtained from monthly reports on Central Java Statistic Agency. The number of samples of preterm infants was 192 infants. The sample size was 20 infants. Earthing duration is 1 hour every day for 30 days. The statistical analysis results in a P-value of 0,000 and t- count 8.065>t table 2.093, indicating a significant difference in the length of Acute Respiratory Infections among preterm infants before and after Earthing therapy. It is recommended that mothers of preterm infants continue to utilize Earthing devices longer to increase the immune system and prevent acute respiratory infection. Furthermore, using Earthing therapy is beneficial for improving the general immune system in preventing or accelerating the healing process of microbial infection with Earthing devices or straight to the ground.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/preeterm-earthing-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/preemie-earthing.webp alt=image width=700><p>&ldquo;In this study, the control process was done for 30 days without Earthing.

It is one of the greatest kept secrets when it comes to our health and aliveness and only a small part of the scientific community really understands the concept. Once health professionals and others realize that grounding is especially important in preventing inflammatory illness, an incredible effect on public health will be realized. The breath of validation from previous published data and real-life testimonials is a testimony of the earth&rsquo;s dramatic impact on healing the human body.</p><p>Health information is constantly changing as a result of new research in various approaches to treating a multitude of inflammatory conditions. Sometimes, even with the most relevant published data, it is difficult to choose which advice is most conducive for healing. For example, it has been noted that perhaps one-third of the medical literature could be fraudulent.. Understanding absolute versus relative risk can also be confusing even for health professionals. And when data is reported in relative risk, only a fraction of the real science is revealed. However, one small established fact that conveys universal agreement is the simple correlation that inflammation is the root cause of almost all diseases!</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/grounding-anti-inflammatory-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><h5 id=37-references>37 References</h5><ol><li><p>The free dictionary.
