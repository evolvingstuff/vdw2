Experiencing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may lead to chronic post- concussive symptoms, increasing the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with cognitive decline, depression, and potentially PTSD through its relationship to testosterone production. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency elevates systematic inflammation, meaning that poor vitamin D status at the time of blast may prolong inflammatory response to mTBI and exacerbate post-concussive symptoms. Since widespread vitamin D deficiency is observed across the U.S. population, poor vitamin D status is expected in service members. Given the high risk for mTBI in service members and suboptimal vitamin D levels observed in this population, treatment of vitamin D deficiency and elucidation of its mechanism in mTBI resilience and recovery merits exploration. Evidence in this review investigates possible protection of achieving optimal vitamin D levels for mTBI resiliency and recovery through its influence on inflammatory and hormonal biomarkers. Despite interest in using vitamin D as treatment for TBI, no human trials have tested the role of vitamin D in mTBI resiliency or recovery, nor have data been prospectively collected on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in service members. The neuroprotective effects of vitamin D warrant further investigation into the role of vitamin D in mTBI management.

fails to mention this study nor those by Matthews

Does have nice appendix of Vitamin D pro and anti-inflammation and bibliography
