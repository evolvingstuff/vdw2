#### Association Between Post-Transplant Vitamin D, Metabolic Syndrome, and Post Transplant Diabetes Mellitus

.Kidney360 ():10.34067/KID.0000000763, March 07, 2025. | DOI: 10.34067/KID.0000000763

Background: 

Associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency and diabetes have been observed in the general population, but are less delineated in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), especially in the context of highly-prevalent metabolic syndrome (MetS) features in KTR. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency may present greater risk in KTR in those with greater burden of MetS features.

Methods: 

We retrospectively evaluated 1792 KTR with no treated diabetes at transplant between 1998 and 2018. Vitamin D was measured at ≥3 months post transplant. MetS features were defined by National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. The primary outcome was treated post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) incidence.

Results: 

In 1792 non-diabetic KTR followed for 10956 patient-years, 237 patients developed PTDM. 

For KTR meeting NCEP-ATP-III criteria, with 

* 4th-quartile 25(OH)D, there were  **1.5**  new diagnoses per 100 patient-years, versus 

*  **4.2 events**  per 100 patient-years in KTR with 1st-quartile 25(OH)D (p&lt;0.001).

In multivariate survival regression, vitamin D was, accounting for individual NCEP-ATP-III criteria, associated with PTDM (HR 0.93 per 10 nmol/mL 25(OH)D, p=0.007) independently of fasting blood sugar and HbA1c. In marginal effects analysis, MetS impact on PTDM increased as serum 25(OH)D levels decreased.

Conclusions: 

Our study suggests that decreased 25(OH)D is associated with increased PTDM, and this marginal impact worsens as KTR have an increased burden of MetS.

!!!!Association Between Post-Transplant Vitamin D, Metabolic Syndrome, and Post Transplant Diabetes Mellitus

Background: 
Associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency and diabetes have been observed in the general population, but are less delineated in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), especially in the context of highly-prevalent metabolic syndrome (MetS) features in KTR. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency may present greater risk in KTR in those with greater burden of MetS features.

Methods: 
We retrospectively evaluated 1792 KTR with no treated diabetes at transplant between 1998 and 2018. Vitamin D was measured at ≥3 months post transplant. MetS features were defined by National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. The primary outcome was treated post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) incidence.

Results: 
In 1792 non-diabetic KTR followed for 10956 patient-years, 237 patients developed PTDM. 
For KTR meeting NCEP-ATP-III criteria, with 
*4th-quartile 25(OH)D, there were __1.5__ new diagnoses per 100 patient-years, versus 
*__4.2 events__ per 100 patient-years in KTR with 1st-quartile 25(OH)D (p&lt;0.001).
 In multivariate survival regression, vitamin D was, accounting for individual NCEP-ATP-III criteria, associated with PTDM (HR 0.93 per 10 nmol/mL 25(OH)D, p=0.007) independently of fasting blood sugar and HbA1c. In marginal effects analysis, MetS impact on PTDM increased as serum 25(OH)D levels decreased.

Conclusions: 
Our study suggests that decreased 25(OH)D is associated with increased PTDM, and this marginal impact worsens as KTR have an increased burden of MetS.
