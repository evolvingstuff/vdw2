#### The Effects of Serum and Follicular Fluid Vitamin D Levels on Assisted Reproductive Techniques: A Prospective Cohort Study

Int J Fertil Steril. 2021 Oct;15(4):280-285. [doi: 10.22074/IJFS.2021.138605.1033](https://doi.org/10.22074/IJFS.2021.138605.1033)

Background: Based on studies on animal models, vitamin D plays an essential role in reproduction by controlling Ca and Mg levels. Despite these findings, the effects of vitamin D deficiency and supplementation on the outcome of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) remain controversial. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between serum and follicular fluid 25-OH vitamin D levels on reproductive outcomes of infertile women.

Materials and methods: This prospective cohort study included 150 infertile women who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The participants were allocated to one of the three groups according to their serum and follicular fluid 25-OH vitamin D concentrations (less than 10 ng/ml, between 10 and 30 ng/ ml and more than 30 ng/ml), and fertilization, cleavage and biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates were compared among the groups. Data was analyzed by SPSS software and using Chi-square and Spearman correlation coefficient.

Results: Serum and follicular fluid vitamin D levels significantly correlated with biochemical (P=0.008), (P=0.003) and clinical pregnancy (P=0.017), (P=0.001) rates respectively . However, the quality of embryos (P=0.125), (P=0.106) and fertilization rate (P=0.082), (P=0.059) were not associated with the level of serum and follicular fluid vitamin D.

Conclusion: This study found that women with higher levels of vitamin D in their serum and follicular fluid are significantly more likely to achieve pregnancy but without affecting the quality of embryo and fertility rate.
