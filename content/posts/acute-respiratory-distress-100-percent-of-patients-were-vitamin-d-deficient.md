Rationale Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a pathogenic factor in sepsis and intensive therapy unit mortality but has not been assessed as a risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Causality of these associations has never been demonstrated.

Objectives To determine if ARDS is associated with vitamin D deficiency in a clinical setting and to determine if vitamin D deficiency in experimental models of ARDS influences its severity.

Methods Human, murine and in vitro primary alveolar epithelial cell work were included in this study.

Findings Vitamin D deficiency (plasma 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L) was ubiquitous in patients with ARDS and present in the vast majority of patients at risk of developing ARDS following oesophagectomy. In a murine model of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide challenge, dietary-induced vitamin D deficiency resulted in exaggerated alveolar inflammation, epithelial damage and hypoxia. In vitro, vitamin D has trophic effects on primary human alveolar epithelial cells affecting >600 genes. In a clinical setting, pharmacological repletion of vitamin D prior to oesophagectomy reduced the observed changes of in vivo measurements of alveolar capillary damage seen in deficient patients.

Conclusions Vitamin D deficiency is common in people who develop ARDS. This deficiency of vitamin D appears to contribute to the development of the condition, and approaches to correct vitamin D deficiency in patients at risk of ARDS should be developed.

#### [MedPageToday article of the study](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Endocrinology/GeneralEndocrinology/51179)

*  **All** of the 55 patients in the study with ARDS were vitamin D deficient (defined as <50 nmol/L)

#### [ARDS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome) Wikipedia

* “Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), previously known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), acute lung injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, or shock lung, is a severe, life-threatening medical condition characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs.”

* “The syndrome has a high mortality between 20 and 50%.”

* “The signs and symptoms of ARDS usually begins within 72 hours of the initial insult or injury to the lung”

* ‘The annual incidence of ARDS is 13-23 people per 100,000 in the general population.”

* Vitamin D was NOT mentioned

#### [Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)](http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/) American Lung Association

* “ARDS usually develops in people who are already very ill with another disease or who have major injuries. They are usually already in the hospital when they develop the ARDS.”
