   * [Feed chicken lots of vitamin D, get 6000 IU per egg with no change in production – Nov 2013](/posts/feed-chicken-lots-of-vitamin-d-get-6000-iu-per-egg-with-no-change-in-production)

   * [Vitamin D in eggs increased 4X after UV lighting near legs was added – April 2019](/posts/vitamin-d-in-eggs-increased-4x-after-uv-lighting-near-legs-was-added)

   * [Hens with Vitamin D were better in at least 5 ways – RCT Aug 2018](/posts/hens-with-vitamin-d-were-better-in-at-least-5-ways-rct) - its was also great for the breeders and the chickens

*  **However** , [Egg vitamin D levels are not permitted to be restored to levels before chickens were raised indoors – Feb 2017](/posts/egg-vitamin-d-levels-are-not-permitted-to-be-restored-to-levels-before-chickens-were-raised-indoors)
