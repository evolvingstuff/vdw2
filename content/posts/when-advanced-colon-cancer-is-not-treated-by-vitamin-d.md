Observational studies have been largely consistent in showing an inverse association between vitamin D and an individualâ€™s risk of developing colorectal cancer. 

Vitamin D protection is further supported by a range of preclinical colon cancer models, including carcinogen, genetic and dietary models. 

A large number of mechanistic studies in both humans and rodents point to vitamin D preventing cancer by regulating cell proliferation. 

Counterbalancing this mostly positive data are the results of human intervention studies in which supplemental  **vitamin D was found to be ineffective for reducing colon cancer risk** . 

One explanation for these discrepancies is the  **timing of vitamin D intervention** . 

It is possible that colon lesions may progress to a stage where they become unresponsive to vitamin D. 

Such a somatic loss in vitamin D responsiveness bears the hallmarks of an epigenetic change. 

Here, we review data supporting the chemopreventive effectiveness of vitamin D and discuss how gene silencing and other molecular changes somatically acquired during colon cancer development may limit the protection that may otherwise be afforded by vitamin D via dietary intervention. 

Finally, we discuss how understanding the mechanisms by which vitamin D protection is lost might be used to devise strategies to enhance its chemopreventive actions.
