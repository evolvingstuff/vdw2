We previously found a positive association between calcium plus vitamin D and anti-osteoporotic drugs and survival among hip fracture patients. Our aim was to verify this observation using a nationwide database. 

A retrospective cohort of home-discharged hip fracture patients aged ?50 years (n?=?23 615) was enrolled from the national database. Primary exposure was medical treatment for osteoporosis and the outcome was all-cause mortality. Cumulative mortalities were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The relationship between mortality and medication purchases was modeled using Cox's proportional hazards regression with time-dependent covariates for medication use. 

One in four women and one in ten men with a hip fracture were treated for osteoporosis in Finland. 

Unadjusted one-year mortality was lower among patients who purchased calcium plus vitamin D or vitamin D supplements and anti-osteoporotic drugs than among those who did not purchase these medications (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.67-0.81). 

The difference in unadjusted cumulative mortality remained in favor of the drug users for at least five years. 

Among men the use of calcium plus vitamin D or vitamin D supplements was associated with lower one-year mortality even after adjustments for observed confounders (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.56-0.97). 

Among women the use of anti-osteoporotic drugs was associated with lower mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.67-0.93). 

There was a tendency to even better survival in both genders if  **calcium plus vitamin D or vitamin D supplements and anti-osteoporotic drugs were used simultaneously** , HR being 

* 0.72 (95% CI 0.50-1.03) in men and 

* 0.62 (95% CI 0.50-0.76) in women.
