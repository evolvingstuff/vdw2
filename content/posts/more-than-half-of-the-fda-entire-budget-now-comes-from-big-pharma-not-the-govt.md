* “In 1992, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) to accelerate FDA licensing approvals of new drugs and vaccines. More than half of the FDA’s budget is now funded by the pharmaceutical industry through PDUFA fees” [Reference](https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-user-fees-from-pharmaceutical-companies-2016-8)

* “This raises serious questions about the integrity of the FDA licensing process when Congress has allowed drug companies to, in effect, bribe the FDA to lower licensing standards in order to grease the skids for certain drugs and vaccines to be fast-tracked to licensure”

* "Faster reviews mean that the FDA often approves drugs despite limited information. It channels more and more experimental treatments, including Nuplazid, into expedited reviews that  **require only one clinical trial to show a benefit to patients** , instead of the traditional two."

> "In addition, over half of the approvals were based on the results of a single trial."

> "It is not known whether the effect observed in the single small trial will be observed in a larger population or replicated in another trial, or whether the effect observed over the short term will persist over the longer term"

> "many new cancer drugs approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints retain their approval status and remain available to prescribing physicians even though postmarketing studies show no survival or quality-of-life (QoL) benefit compared with placebo or observation groups."

> "Of 36 drugs that were approved between 2008 and 2012, 

   * 18 did not significantly prolong overall survival in postmarket studies. 

   * QoL information was available for 7 drugs, and

* Compared with placebo or observation groups,

   * 2 drugs demonstrated worse effects on QoL, 

   * 4 drugs showed no statistical difference, and 

   * 1 drug had mixed results. In addition,

   * 1 drug reduced overall survival and

   * 6 offered no survival benefit compared with placebo or observation groups."
