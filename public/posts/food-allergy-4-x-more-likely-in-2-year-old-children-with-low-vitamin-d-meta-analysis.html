Current literature regarding the association of vitamin D insufficiency and food allergy is contradicting. The purpose of our study was to investigate this association. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. PubMeD and Scopus databases were systematically searched for case–control studies investigating the association between pediatric food allergy and vitamin D insufficiency. Our search yielded 806 studies. Ten final studies were considered eligible for qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

* Children with vitamin D insufficiency were found to have 68% more probability to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled OR: 1.68, 95% CI &lt;span&gt;[1.25–2.27]&lt;/span&gt;, p-value: 0.001). 

In their second year of life they were 

* 4 times more likely to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled  **OR: 4.06** , 95% CI &lt;span&gt;[1.93–8.56]&lt;/span&gt;, p-value: &lt; 0.001), and 

* 56% more probable to develop food sensitization (OR: 1.56, 95% CI &lt;span&gt;[1.15–2.11]&lt;/span&gt;, p-value: &lt; 0.004).

Children in Australia with vitamin D insufficiency were almost 4 times more likely to develop egg sensitization (adjusted OR: 3.79, 95% CI &lt;span&gt;[1.19–12.08]&lt;/span&gt;, p-value: 0.024). Children with vitamin D insufficiency were almost twice as likely to have peanut sensitization (OR: 1.96, 95% CI &lt;span&gt;[1.08–3.57]&lt;/span&gt;, p-value: 0.028).

Conclusion: Decreased maternal vitamin D levels and infant vitamin D insufficiency appear to increase the incidence of food allergies, particularly in the second year of life. To confirm this association, multicenter longitudinal studies are required.

Current literature regarding the association of vitamin D insufficiency and food allergy is contradicting. The purpose of our study was to investigate this association. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. PubMeD and Scopus databases were systematically searched for case–control studies investigating the association between pediatric food allergy and vitamin D insufficiency. Our search yielded 806 studies. Ten final studies were considered eligible for qualitative and quantitative analysis. 
*Children with vitamin D insufficiency were found to have 68% more probability to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled OR: 1.68, 95% CI [1.25–2.27], p-value: 0.001). 
In their second year of life they were
