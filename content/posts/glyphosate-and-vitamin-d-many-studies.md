* "Since mammals do not have the  **shikimate pathway** , it was suggested that glyphosate would not affect human health. However, some microorganisms do have the shikimate pathway, and it’s via this link that many of glyphosate’s adverse effects in humans may occur. According to the study"

* "[New research](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djac242/6984725) by top U.S. government scientists found that people exposed to the widely used weed-killing chemical glyphosate, a key ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup weedkiller, have biomarkers in their urine linked to the development of cancer and other diseases."

* "The CDC reported that out of 2,310 urine samples taken from a group of Americans intended to be representative of the U.S. population, 1,885 were laced with detectable traces of glyphosate."

* "The EPA now is revisiting its glyphosate evaluation and expects to issue a decision for glyphosate in 2026."

#### US court bands Dicamba (again) - Feb 2024

 **[US court bans three weedkillers and finds EPA broke law in approval process](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/07/us-weedkiller-ban-dicamba-epa?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** 

* "This is the second time a federal court has banned these weedkillers since they were introduced for the 2017 growing season. In 2020, the ninth circuit court of appeals issued its own ban, but months later the Trump administration reapproved the weedkilling products, just one week before the presidential election at a press conference in the swing state of Georgia."

* "Bury wrote that the EPA did not allow many people who are deeply affected by the weedkiller – including specialty farmers, conservation groups and more – to comment."

* "Syngenta is also facing nationwide litigation over its  **paraquat**  herbicide, which thousands of plaintiffs claim causes Parkinson’s disease.""

##### Monsanto’s New Weed Killer, Dicamba, Divides Farmers - NYT Sept 2017

 **[UNew York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/business/monsanto-dicamba-weed-killer.html?_r=0)** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">The replacement may be worse than Roundup in many ways</span>** 

1. More expensive 

1. Damages trees in addition to killing weeds

1. Drifts farther

> "Because genetically modified crops allow dicamba to be sprayed later in the year, after crops emerge from the ground, and in hotter and more humid weather, the chemical is susceptible to what is known as “volatility” — it can turn into a gas and drift onto whatever happens to be nearby."

1. Health problems?

> "“For both dicamba and 2,4-D, the reproductive risks and birth defects” are “most worrisome.”

##### Update - Monsanto rewards farmers who use DiCamba Dec 2017

Farmers have been reluctant to use DiCamba (problems on own farm, neighboring farm, and state)

Monsanto now giving $5/acre reward if a farmer uses it (it costs $11/acre)

The farmers there are spraying it around the root structure to try and keep weeds from competing for things like moisture and nutrients. The science on that I have read … is more the impact on the soil because glyphosate kills the beneficial microbes in the soil that help the plant to remain healthy. So, when you’re killing those beneficial microbes in the soil, the plant is more susceptible to disease, or perhaps needs more fertilizer,"

#### Perhaps can flush Glyphosate from body with high dose Glyscene for a few months

* "To eliminate glyphosate, you need to saturate your body with glycine. Klinghardt recommends taking 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of glycine powder twice a day for a few weeks and then lower the dose to one-fourth teaspoon (1 gram) twice a day. This forces the glyphosate out of your system, allowing it to be eliminated through your urine."

* "I personally have been taking 1 gram twice a day for some time now. The glycine is inexpensive and actually tastes sweet. Ideally it is best to take it around the time you are eating food that might be contaminated with glyphosate."

* quote from expert

   * "At least for a while, we use high doses of glycine. There are no issues with it. There are no problems with it. The other one that has been published is admittedly only a chicken study that shows that humic acid and fulvic acid can completely clean up the organ systems of a chicken …

   * "So, we do the glycine for a while.  **We monitor the urine output of glyphosate** . When that slows down — in some people two months, in some it's six months — we back off on the glycine and go on a smaller dose."
