PURPOSE:

To explore strategies for disseminating online information about vitamin D to young adults.

METHODS:

Participants were 50 males and females aged 18-25 years, living in Ontario, Canada. Eight focus groups (4 male; 4 female) were conducted; participants also completed a socio-demographic questionnaire. Audio files were transcribed verbatim; thematic analysis was used to identify key themes.

RESULTS:

Thematic analysis revealed that an effective educational intervention geared towards this population should be  **simple, brief, interesting, personally relevant, credible, and include incentives.** 

CONCLUSIONS:

Feedback regarding intervention methodology could be used to inform interventions aiming to increase intake of vitamin D or other nutrients among young adults.
