#### 40% less Cancer recurrence after Breast Cancer surgery if NO radiation treatment - Dec 2023

 **[Compelling case for skipping RT in some early breast cancers - MD  Edge](https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/266920/breast-cancer/compelling-case-skipping-rt-some-early-breast?ecd=WNL_EVE_231207_mdedge)** 

* Recurrence rate: 1% in 5 years if no radiation therapy vs 1.7% if radiation therapy

* "Omitting radiation therapy led to better health-related quality of life and functional and cosmetic outcomes, and the women viewed not having radiation as highly acceptable and appropriate treatment, not undertreatment."

* Based on a study in Lancet: Postoperative radiotherapy omission in selected patients with early breast cancer following preoperative breast MRI (PROSPECT): primary results of a prospective two-arm study, [which is behind a paywall](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)02476-5)

* VitaminDWiki suspects that the radiation wounds the immune system, making it less likely to be able to fight off future cancers.  Wonder if radiation decreases vitamin D levels on a long-term basis?

#### 70 % of women with breast cancer have genes which indicate that Chemo is NOT needed - June 2018

* [Good News for Women With Breast Cancer: Many Don’t Need Chemo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/health/breast-cancer-chemo.html) New York Times

> "The study, called TAILORx, is being published by The New England Journal of Medicine and was to be presented on Sunday (June 3) at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The study began in 2006 and was paid for by the United States and Canadian governments and philanthropic groups. Genomic Health, the company that makes the gene test, helped pay after 2016."

> "For every 100 women we were treating, we were probably preventing about 4 distant recurrences.”

> "Of the 9,719 patients with complete follow-up information, 70 percent had scores of 11 to 25 on the gene test. They had surgery and radiation, and then were assigned at random to receive either endocrine therapy alone, or endocrine therapy plus chemo. The median follow-up was more than seven years. Over time, the two groups fared equally well. Chemo had no advantage. After nine years, 93.9 percent were still alive in the endocrine-only group, versus 93.8 percent in those who also got chemo. In the endocrine group, 83.3 percent were free of invasive disease, compared with 84.3 percent who got both treatments.  **There were no significant differences."**

#### Suggestions to help with Breast Cancer Treatment - Sept 2018

Advising Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer: A Narrative Review.

J Altern Complement Med. 2018 Sep/Oct;24(9-10):902-909. [doi: 10.1089/acm.2018.0150.](https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2018.0150.)

Lemanne D1,2,3, Maizes V1.

A majority of women undergoing conventional treatment for breast cancer also undertake complementary and integrative approaches. Practitioners knowledgeable about the evidence base behind common integrative approaches can help patients attain improved quality of life, and at times, improved survival. Evidence-based recommendations include the following: 

* a plant-based diet for general health after diagnosis, and 

* carbohydrate restriction for patients with estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal breast cancer may be prudent.

* Other dietary recommendations include a 13-h daily overnight fast. Carefully selected patients may choose to fast the day before and the day of chemotherapy to decrease side effects. 

Specific food recommendations include 

* avoidance or limitation of alcohol, and liberal culinary use of cruciferous vegetables, coffee, green tea, soy, and flaxseed. 

Promising supplements include diindolylmethane and melatonin. 

Omega 3 fatty acids may help with bone density in patients on aromatase inhibitors, but may increase chemotherapy resistance.

Findings regarding the usefulness of multivitamins,  **vitamin D** , vitamin C, and vitamin E are  **weak and/or mixed** 

different exercise modalities may have different effects and thus play different roles in breast cancer therapy. Aerobic and resistance training combined during breast cancer chemotherapy may confer a survival benefit, while yoga may improve outcome in lymphedema patients. 

Current evidence suggests that meditation, yoga, breathing, music therapy, guided imagery, and hypnosis may improve mood and quality of life during breast cancer treatment. 

Acupuncture is useful for treating side effects of breast cancer therapies, including hot flushes, aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and vulvodynia. 

Vaginal moisturizers and vaginal rings supplying low-dose estrogen can be useful in the treatment of symptoms of estrogen-deprivation states caused by breast cancer treatments; such symptoms include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and sexual dysfunction. Carbon dioxide laser technology can rejuvenate atrophied vaginal mucosa and relieve dyspareunia, allowing avoidance of estrogen therapy. Tertiary sexual health centers are available for referral.

#### Tamoxifen may be synergistic with Vitamin D

 **The following is a result of a 1/2 hour look on the internet April 2021** 

 **They both prevent Breast Cancer re-occurrence and they help each other** 

 **[Inhibition of Breast Cancer Cell Growth by Combined Treatment with Vitamin D3 Analogues and Tamoxifen](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/54/21/5711)**  1994, Free PDF

"Tamoxifen increased the sensitivity of the cells to the vitamin D3 compounds 2- to 4000-fold, which was expressed by a shift to lower median effective concentration values."

 **The Investigation of the Effects of Tamoxifen and Vitamin D Combination on the Expression of P53, Bcl-2 and Bax and Cell Cycle in Mcf-7 Cell Line**  Dec 2018

"An effective concentration was found for Tamoxifen. Vitamin D alone did not reduce cell proliferation but decreased cell proliferation with combination. As a result, it was found that therapies using these two agents separately decreased the proliferation of cancer cells and induced cell arrest in the G0/G1 phase in the cell cycle and changed the expressions of p53, BcL-2 and Bax proteins"

#### Breast cancer risk increases by 14% if 1 alcoholic drink daily

 **[Alcohol Is the Breast Cancer Risk No One Wants to Talk About](https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-is-the-breast-cancer-risk-no-one-wants-to-talk-about/) Wired Oct 2021** 

* "14 grams of alcohol, which typically means one 12-ounce beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or a 1.5-ounce shot of spirits, such as gin or whiskey."

* " By their estimate, 14,000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the US in 2020 could be attributed to prior drinking."
