Background/Aim: To investigate the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on gut microbiota. 

Patients and Methods: Twenty adults with vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency [25(OH)D <30 ng/ml](25(OH)D%20<30%20ng/ml) were enrolled and given 600, 4,000 or 10,000 IUs/day of oral vitamin D3. Stool samples were collected at baseline and 8 weeks for identifying gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. 

Results: Baseline serum 25(OH)D was associated with increased relative abundance of Akkermansia and decreased relative abundance of Porphyromonas (p<0.05). After the intervention, we observed a dose-dependent increase in relative abundance of Bacteroides with a significant difference between the 600 IUs and the 10,000 IUs groups (p=0.027), and Parabacteroides with a significant difference between the 600 IUs and the 4,000 IUs groups (p=0.039). 

Conclusion: Increased serum 25(OH)D was associated with increased beneficial bacteria and decreased pathogenic bacteria. A dose-dependent increase in bacteria associated with decreased inflammatory bowel disease activity was observed after vitamin D3 supplementation.
