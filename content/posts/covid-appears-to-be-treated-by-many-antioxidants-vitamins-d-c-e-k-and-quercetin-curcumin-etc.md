Objective: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects millions of people worldwide. The article aims to review the therapeutic perspective on natural antioxidants, their mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics in management and cure of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: We conducted a literature search including World Health Organization and National Institute of Health guidelines and clinical trials registered with ClinicalTri- als.gov limited to antioxidants in COVID-19 management.

Results: Elderly, immunocompromised patients, and others with underlying health conditions or multiple comorbidities have a high mortality rate. Disrupted redox homeostasis and oxidative stress seem to be biological pathways that may increase personal vulnerability to infection. Antioxidants like vitamins C, D, E, epigallocatechin-3 gallate, and morin have been reported to protect against COVID-19 disease. Reactive oxygen species are immunological regulatory elements of viral replication. Natural antioxidants exhibit potential action in preventing inflammation and organ dysfunction during viral infection. They also increase glutathione level, oxygenation rate, and immunological responses in the treatment of sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusion: No wonder the selection of prevention, treatment, and cure of COVID- 19 and SARS-CoV-2 mainly depends upon the antiviral and immunoregulatory activity which they possess. Yet, their efficacy against COVID-19 is of great concern and demands extensive study.

#### Antioxidants and Long Covid - Nov 2022 preprint

Open Access Library Journal, 2022, Volume 9

Patrick Chambers, MD Dept of Pathology, Torrance Memorial Medical Center

Long Covid has many symptoms that overlap with ME(myalgic encephalomyelitis)/CFS(chronic fatigue syndrome), FM(fibromyalgia), EBV(Epstein-Barr virus), CMV(cytomegalovirus), CIRS (chronic inflammatory response syndrome), MCAS(mast cell activation syndrome), POTS(postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), and post viral fatigue syndrome. They all portend a “long haul” with an antioxidant shortfall and elevated Ca:Mg. 

Oxidative stress is the root cause. Linkage between TGF(transforming growth factor)-β, IFN(interferon)-γ, the RAS(renin angiotensin system), and the KKS(kallikrein kinin system) is discussed. Technical explanations for the renin aldosterone paradox in POTS, the betrayal of TGF-β, and the commonality of markers for the Warburg effect are offered. The etiology of the common Long Covid symptoms of post exertional malaise, fatigue, and brain fog as well as anosmia, hair loss, and GI symptoms is technically discussed. Ca:Mg is critical to the glutamate/GABA(gamma amino butyric acid) balance. The role of GABA and butyrates from the “good” intestinal bacteria in the gut-brain axis and its correlation with chronic fatigue diseases are explored. The crosstalk between the ENS(enteric nervous system) and the ANS(autonomic nervous system) and the role of the vagus in both are emphasized. HRV(heart rate variability), the fifth vital sign, points to an expanded gut-brain-heart/lung axis. A suggested approach to all of these - Long Covid, chronic fatigue diseases, post viral fatigue syndrome, and general health - is presented.

##### Wonder why the study on this page did not include the antioxidants of Zinc, Magnesium, Selenium etc?

---

##### Note: Quercetin, Curcumin also get more Vitamin D to cells (increase activation of Vitamin D Receptor)
