It is noteworthy that the suspicious group and rickets serum 25 (OH) D level was no significant difference, suggesting in typical rickets before, already exists in children, even vitamin D deficiency may be a long time. Further illustrate the serum 25 (OH) D levels decreased for the early detection of rickets significant. At this point, even better than the classic X line.

In this study, 90 7 nmoZL as the diagnostic value of the critical point of view from a sensitivity of 68.49% and 72.73% specificity, there are certain clinical value. Both as soon as possible to prevent and detect the occurrence of rickets, it will not increase the psychological and economic burden of the parents.
