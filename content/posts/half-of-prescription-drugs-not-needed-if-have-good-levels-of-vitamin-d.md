# Personal opinion expressed by a pharmacist

If vitamin D levels were returned to the pre-1986 levels in the typical US population, as a pharmacist I have become entirely certain that  **I would be dispensing 50% LESS prescriptions each day** , primarily the type I call the “lifetime” palliative meds that will never cure but just offer the chance at great cost and risk of severe adverse effects of the possible suppression of a symptom(s) – the very symptoms avoidable to some profound level were only all concerned in heathcare delivery today were to militate cautiously to a standard blood level in each patient of 50 ng/ml. “healthy” or not, just as a general, FUNDAMENTAL measure of prudence. Along with temp, bp, heart rate, weight, height, etc, the marker of a 25 (OH)D level should be determined/established parameter the practitioner should routinely consider as part of the basic health assessment upon initial presentation. And, NEVER, EVER, should a patient accept from a doctor the phrase “your vitamin d blood level is ok” – FIGHT for the actual number – chances are high that “his/her” opinion of “ok” is a crappific 10 ng/ml based on the doc’s poor training. Find out that supposed ok number, and get it to 50 ng/ml. as soon as possible. Then monitor actively your symptoms’ responses to “mere” vitamin D. It may take as little time as two weeks, or as long as months, but it is worth considering for a variety of logical and soundly safe scientific reasons. The LEAST of which is the lessening of prescription use, cost, and risk.
