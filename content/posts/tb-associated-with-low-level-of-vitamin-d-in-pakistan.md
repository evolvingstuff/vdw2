 **Abstract** 

To assess the association between vitamin D deficiency and   tuberculosis disease progression, we studied vitamin D levels in a cohort of   tuberculosis patients and their contacts (N = 129) in Pakistan. Most (79%)   persons showed deficiency. Low vitamin D levels were associated with a 5-fold   increased risk for progression to tuberculosis.

Deficiency of vitamin D (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) has long   been implicated in activation of tuberculosis (TB) ([1](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)).   Serum levels of vitamin D in TB patients are lower than in healthy controls ([2,3](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)).   Paradoxically, prolonged treatment of TB also causes a decline in serum vitamin   D levels ([2](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)). Several studies have suggested   that vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator of innate immune responses ([4,5](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1))   by acting as a cofactor for induction of antimycobacterial activity ([6](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)).   Of the 22 countries that have the highest TB incidence, Pakistan ranks eighth.   In a previous study in Karachi, we observed that active disease developed in 7   (6.4%) of 109 TB case-contacts within 2 years ([7](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)). In   the present study, we explored the role of vitamin D deficiency in TB disease   progression within this cohort.

### {ANAME()}stu{ANAME}The Study

Household contacts (n = 109) of 20 patients with recently 			  diagnosed sputum-positive pulmonary TB (index case-patients) were enrolled at 			  Masoomeen General Hospital, in Karachi during 2001–2004 for a TB household 			  cohort study ([7](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)). Blood samples were collected 			  at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. Visiting health workers 			  reviewed clinical charts every 3 months for the first 24 months and at a final 			  home study visit during November 2007–January 2008 (45–74 months from 			  baseline). Persons with secondary cases were referred to a consultant at 			  Masoomeen General Hospital for additional investigation, including assessment 			  of physical signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, chest radiographs, and sputum 			  smear microscopy ([7](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)). For the present study, 129 			  de-identified, plasma samples preserved at –70°C from the baseline visit were 			  shipped to Stanford University (Stanford, CA, USA) for analysis of vitamin D 			  levels. Total circulating serum 25<span>[OH]</span> vitamin D was measured with ELISA by 			  using the Immuno Diagnostic System Ltd (IDS, Fountain Hill, AZ, USA). All 			  protocols were followed according to manufacturer's instructions. Each test was 			  run in duplicate, with mean absorbance computed from the average for 2 wells 			  normalized to a zero calibrator well. Levels of vitamin D in test samples were 			  derived by fitting a 2-parameter logistic curve to 6 standard levels and 			  expressed as ng/mL (1 nmol/L × 0.4 = 1 ng/mL). All R<sup>2</sup>values were &gt;95%. The assay detection range was 6–360 nmol/L (2.4–144 			  ng/mL). Levels in 1 person were below the detection limit and were excluded 			  from analysis. The ethical review committees of Aga Khan and Stanford 			  universities approved the study protocol.

We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the association of 			  vitamin D levels with outcome of TB disease in 100 household contacts completing ==&gt;==1 follow-up visit. Vitamin D levels in the cohort were classified in 			  population-based tertiles (low, middle, high). We used SAS version 9.3 (SAS 			  Institute, Cary, NC, USA) for statistical analyses.

Median vitamin D level for the 128 cohort participants was 			  9.1 ng/mL (interquatrile range <span>[IQR]</span> 5.3–14.7); levels were 9.6 ng/mL (IQR 			  5.8–19.1) for 100 disease-free contacts, 7.9 ng/mL (IQR 4.7–10.3) for 20 TB 			  index case-patients, 4.6 ng/mL (IQR 4.0–5.2) for 2 co-prevalent TB 			  case-patients who were receiving antituberculous treatment at recruitment, and 			  5.1 ng/mL (IQR 3.4–14.3) in 6 household contacts with a history of TB treatment 			  (2–10 years) ([Figure 1](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#figure1), panel A). In the 100 			  disease-free household contacts, vitamin D levels were significantly higher 			  than in the 28 participants with a history of TB diagnosis at baseline (p = 			  0.02; Mann-Whitney U test) ([Figure 1](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#figure1), panel B). Median vitamin D 			  levels were significantly lower in the 74 female patients than in the 54 male 			  patients (7.8 vs. 11.9, Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0004) ([Figure 1](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#figure1), 			  panel C). When we stratified the cohort by vitamin D level, 79% had deficient 			  (&lt;20 ng/mL), 14% had insufficient (20–30 ng/mL), and 7% had sufficient 			  (&gt;30 ng/mL) levels of vitamin D (click="MM_openBrWindow('853-T.htm',,'scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=700,height=500')" href="javascript://" _fcksavedurl="javascript://"&gt;Table).

We next analyzed risk for progression to active TB in 			  relation to plasma vitamin D levels. Of the 100 disease-free household 			  contacts, 8 (8%) progressed to active disease during 4 years of follow-up. TB 			  progression was significantly associated with relatively lower plasma vitamin D 			  levels ([Figure 2](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#figure2)). Disease progressed in 7 (23%) of 30 patients with 			  plasma vitamin D levels in the lowest tertile (&lt;7 ng/mL), 1 (3%) of 32 with 			  vitamin D levels in the middle tertile (7–13 ng/mL), and none of 30 in the 			  highest tertile (&gt;13 ng/mL) (p = 0.002, log rank). Six (75%) of 8 patients 			  whose TB progressed were female patients with vitamin D levels in the lowest 			  tertile. Further adjustment for age and sex yielded a relative risk for 			  progression of 5.1 (1.2–21.3, p = 0.03) for a relative 1-log decrement in 			  vitamin D levels, which suggests that vitamin D deficiency might be a strong 			  risk factor for TB disease.

### {ANAME()}con{ANAME}Conclusion

In this cohort follow-up study from Pakistan, low vitamin D 			  levels were associated with progression to active TB disease in healthy 			  household contacts. No deaths occurred during the follow-up period from either 			  TB or unrelated causes. Our findings also suggest that vitamin D deficiency may 			  explain the higher susceptibility of women to disease progression in our 			  cohort. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in female patients also was 			  reported in ambulatory patients at Aga Khan University ([8](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)). 			  Factors such as low socioeconomic status, poor nutrition, traditional/cultural 			  traits, and little exposure to sunlight may further explain vitamin D 			  deficiency in female patients in this cohort. Despite several limitations to 			  our study, such as information about diet, body mass index, exposure to 			  sunlight and the relatively small number of study participants, our results are 			  supported by a meta-analysis of 7 case-control studies in different ethnic 			  populations (including an Indian population) that showed 70% of healthy 			  controls had higher vitamin D levels than did untreated TB patients ([3](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)). 			  Previously in African immigrants in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia ([9](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)), 			  lower mean vitamin D levels were associated with high probability of latent, 			  current, or past TB infection. Cross-sectional studies are needed in Pakistan 			  to appreciate this association with sex and susceptibility to TB with larger 			  sample size. Most of the South Asian population, including Pakistani immigrants 			  to European countries and South Indians, had &lt;10 ng/mL of serum vitamin D 			  level ([10](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1)) and is consistent with reports from Aga Khan 			  Hospital ([8](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1),[11](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#11)). 			  Vitamin D plays an important role in activation of 1 ?-hydroxylase to 			  convert 25(OH) D to its active form <span>[1, 25 (OH) 2D]</span> that leads to expression of 			  cathelicidin, a microbicidal peptide for Mycobacterium tuberculosis([5](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#1),[12](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#11)). 			  Serum levels &gt;30 ng/mL provide an adequate substrate for the enzyme. Serum 			  levels &lt;20 ng/mL may therefore impair the macrophage-initiated innate immune 			  response to M. tuberculosisand offer a possible explanation for 			  geographic and ethnic ([13](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#11)) variations in susceptibility to TB.

Vitamin D supplementation during TB treatment remains 			  controversial; a few studies have reported clinical improvement in pulmonary TB 			  ([14](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#11)) 			  and 1 study reported no effect ([15](http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/5/853.htm#11)''). However, our 			  findings indicate that further studies should be conducted regarding use of 			  vitamin D as a supplement for persons undergoing treatment for TB and those 			  with latent TB infection.
