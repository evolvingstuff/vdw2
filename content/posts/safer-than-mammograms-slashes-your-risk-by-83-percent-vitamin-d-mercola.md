#### [Why a Vitamin D Test Is More Important Than a Mammogram](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/10/15/vitamin-d-optimization-health-benefits.aspx?utm_source=dnl&utm_medium=email&utm_content=art1&utm_campaign=20181015Z1_UCM&et_cid=DM240709&et_rid=444996907)

 **STORY AT-A-GLANCE** 

* October is national Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the U.S. National Mammography Day is October 19. Vitamin D optimization could potentially eliminate a vast majority of breast cancers, yet this key information is completely ignored by conventional breast cancer awareness campaigns

* Most cancers occur in people with a vitamin D blood level between 10 and 40 ng/mL, and the optimal level for cancer protection has been identified as being between 60 and 80 ng/mL

* Research shows having a vitamin D blood level above 60 ng/mL lowers your risk of breast cancer by more than 80 percent, compared to having a level below 20 ng/mL

* Recent research shows postmenopausal women who receive a diagnosis of breast cancer are more likely to have low vitamin D and be overweight than women who receive a negative diagnosis

* This year, do your breast health a real favor and get your vitamin D level checked. One of the easiest and most cost-effective ways of doing this is to enroll in the D*Action Breast Cancer Prevention project, which now includes both vitamin D and omega-3 testing
