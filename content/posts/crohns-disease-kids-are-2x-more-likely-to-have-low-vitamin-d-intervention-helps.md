Background:

Prior studies of vitamin D metabolism in Crohn's disease (CD) did not include controls or examine changes following diagnosis. This study examined associations among 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D]</span>, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in incident pediatric CD, compared with controls, and following diagnosis.

Methods:

Serum vitamin D and PTH were measured at diagnosis (n = 78), 6, 12, and a median of 43 months (n = 52) later in CD participants, and once in 221 controls. Multivariate regression was used to examine baseline associations and quasi-least squares regression to assess subsequent changes.

Results:

At diagnosis, 42% of CD participants were 25(OH)D-deficient (<20 ng/mL). The odds ratio for deficiency was **2.1**  (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 1.1, 3.9; P < 0.05) vs. controls, adjusted for age, race, and season. 1,25(OH)2D was lower in CD vs. controls (P < 0.05), adjusted for 25(OH)D, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?), and PTH. TNF-? was associated with lower 1,25(OH)2D (P < 0.05), and the positive association between PTH and 1,25(OH)2D in controls was absent in CD (interaction P = 0.02). Among participants with 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL, CD was associated with lower PTH (P < 0.05) vs. controls. 

Following diagnosis, 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D improved (P < 0.001). 

At the final visit, 3% were 25(OH)D-deficient, PTH was no longer low relative to 25(OH)D, and 1,25(OH)2D was significantly elevated (P < 0.001) compared with controls.

Conclusions:

Incident CD was associated with 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D deficiency and a relative hypoparathyroidism that resolved following diagnosis. 

Inflammatory cytokine suppression of PTH and renal 1-?-hyroxylase may contribute to these alterations. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2012;)

## Unfortunately the abstract does not say how much, or what type of vitamin D intervention. Have requested information from the authors

Suspect that a type of vitamin D that can be absorbed by poorly functioning gut was used, such as
