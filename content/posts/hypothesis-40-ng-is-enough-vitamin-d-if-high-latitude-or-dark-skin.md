# [Recommendations](/tags/recommendations.html) of amount of vitamin D to have generally vary between 30ng/ml and 60 ng/ml

## [The Institute of Medicine](/tags/the-institute-of-medicine.html) proposed 20 ng/ml in Nov 2010]

# Dr. Veith presented an interesting hypothesis in May 2011

## Some people (Caucasians?) living in high latitudes (which have a large variation in UV during the year)

## get adverse reactions to high (50 ng+) levels of vitamin D for the entire year

## It MIGHT be OK to have higher levels during the summer.

## The data only hints that having > 50NG/ml all year long might be a problem

# [CICK HERE](/tags/cick-here.html) to get to reference - PDF and soon audio and video

## Humans evolved to have a constant amount of vitamin D

# Prostate Cancer U-shaped curve from [Lappe May 2011](/tags/lappe-may-2011.html)

## Note: this shows having 24 ng/ml all year long increases prostate cancer

# Concerning people with dark skins

## There have been various reports in 2009, 2010, and 2011 which seem to indicate that dark skinned people do not need as much as those with light skins

## Unknown so far

* Does this apply only to dark skinned people living far from the equator
