Background: Long COVID (LC) is characterized by persistent symptoms at least 3 months after a SARS-COV-2 infection. LC has been associated with fungal translocation, gut dysfunction, and enhanced systemic inflammation. Currently, there is no approved treatment for this condition. The anti-inflammatory effect of vitamins K2 and D3 was shown to help attenuate the course of acute COVID-19 infection. 

Objective and hypothesis: This trial aims to investigate the effects of vitamins K2/D3 on LC symptoms, as well as gut and inflammatory markers, in people with established long COVID. Our hypothesis is that by attenuating systemic inflammation, vitamins K2/D3 will improve long COVID symptoms. 

Methods: This single-site randomized controlled study enrolled adults experiencing ≥2 moderate LC symptoms at least 3 months after a COVID-19 infection. The RECOVER Long COVID Research Index and number and type of LC symptoms were considered. Participants were randomized 2:1 to daily 240 µg K2 (pure MK-7 form) and 2000 UI vitamin D3 or standard of care (SOC) for 24 weeks. The endpoints were changes in symptomatology and in select inflammatory, metabolic, and gut biomarkers at 24 weeks. Results: We enrolled 151 participants (n = 98 received vit K2/D3 and 53 received SOC). The median age was 46 years; 71% were female and 29% were non-white. Baseline demographics were balanced between groups. At 24 weeks, the active treatment group only had a sharp increase in 25(OH) D, indicating good treatment adherence. In the vitamin K2/D3 arm, there was a 7.1% decrease in the proportion who had an LC Index ≥12 (vs. a 7.2% increase in the SOC group; p = 0.01). The average number of LC symptoms remained stable in the vitamin K2/D3 arm but increased in the SOC arm (p = 0.03). Additionally, reductions in oxidized LDL, inflammatory markers sTNF-RI and sCD163, and fungal translocation marker (1,3)-β-d-glucan were observed in the vitamin K2/D3 arm compared to the SOC arm (p &lt; 0.01) over 24 weeks. 

Conclusions: Vitamins K2/D3 improved the RECOVER Long COVID Index, the number of LC symptoms, and several gut and inflammatory markers. Vitamins K2/D3 provide a promising safe intervention for people suffering from long COVID.

#### Summary of study by [Perplexity AI Jan 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-summarize-the-attached-dUXzO_ChQRuu8bhNLOzV5Q)

This groundbreaking randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of vitamin K2 and D3 supplementation 

on Long COVID symptoms and associated biomarkers. Here are the key findings:

 **&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00F;&quot;&gt;Study Design and Participants&lt;/span&gt;** 

The trial included 151 participants with Long COVID, randomized 2:1 to receive either:

* Treatment group (n=98): Daily doses of 240μg vitamin K2 and 2000 IU vitamin D3

* Control group (n=53): Standard of care

&gt; The median age was 46 years, with 71% female participants

 **&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00F;&quot;&gt;Key Resultss&lt;/span&gt;** 

 **Symptom Improvement** 

* Treatment group showed a 7.1% decrease in Long COVID Index scores

* Control group showed a 7.2% increase in scores

* The vitamin K2/D3 group maintained stable symptom numbers while the control group experienced increases

 **Biomarker Changes** 

The treatment group showed significant reductions in:

* Oxidized LDL

* Inflammatory markers (sTNF-RI and sCD163)

* Fungal translocation marker (1,3)-β-d-glucan

 **Safety and Compliance** 

* The treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events attributed to supplementation

* Good treatment adherence was demonstrated by increased vitamin D levels in the treatment group

 **&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00F;&quot;&gt;Clinical Significances&lt;/span&gt;** 

This study represents the first clinical evidence that vitamin K2/D3 supplementation may effectively:

* Reduce Long COVID symptoms

* Improve gut permeability

* Decrease systemic inflammation

* Lower fungal translocation markers

The findings suggest that this safe, accessible intervention could provide a promising treatment option 

for individuals suffering from Long COVID, particularly given the current lack of approved treatments for this condition

!!!!Vitamins K2 and D3 Improve Long COVID, Fungal Translocation, and Inflammation: Randomized Controlled Trial
Nutrients 2025, 17(2), 304; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17020304

Background: Long COVID (LC) is characterized by persistent symptoms at least 3 months after a SARS-COV-2 infection. LC has been associated with fungal translocation, gut dysfunction, and enhanced systemic inflammation. Currently, there is no approved treatment for this condition. The anti-inflammatory effect of vitamins K2 and D3 was shown to help attenuate the course of acute COVID-19 infection. 

Objective and hypothesis: This trial aims to investigate the effects of vitamins K2/D3 on LC symptoms, as well as gut and inflammatory markers, in people with established long COVID. Our hypothesis is that by attenuating systemic inflammation, vitamins K2/D3 will improve long COVID symptoms. 

Methods: This single-site randomized controlled study enrolled adults experiencing ≥2 moderate LC symptoms at least 3 months after a COVID-19 infection. The RECOVER Long COVID Research Index and number and type of LC symptoms were considered. Participants were randomized 2:1 to daily 240 µg K2 (pure MK-7 form) and 2000 UI vitamin D3 or standard of care (SOC) for 24 weeks. The endpoints were changes in symptomatology and in select inflammatory, metabolic, and gut biomarkers at 24 weeks. Results: We enrolled 151 participants (n = 98 received vit K2/D3 and 53 received SOC). The median age was 46 years; 71% were female and 29% were non-white. Baseline demographics were balanced between groups. At 24 weeks, the active treatment group only had a sharp increase in 25(OH) D, indicating good treatment adherence. In the vitamin K2/D3 arm, there was a 7.1% decrease in the proportion who had an LC Index ≥12 (vs. a 7.2% increase in the SOC group; p = 0.01). The average number of LC symptoms remained stable in the vitamin K2/D3 arm but increased in the SOC arm (p = 0.03). Additionally, reductions in oxidized LDL, inflammatory markers sTNF-RI and sCD163, and fungal translocation marker (1,3)-β-d-glucan were observed in the vitamin K2/D3 arm compared to the SOC arm (p &lt; 0.01) over 24 weeks. 

Conclusions: Vitamins K2/D3 improved the RECOVER Long COVID Index, the number of LC symptoms, and several gut and inflammatory markers. Vitamins K2/D3 provide a promising safe intervention for people suffering from long COVID.

!!!!Summary of study by [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-summarize-the-attached-dUXzO_ChQRuu8bhNLOzV5Q|Perplexity AI Jan 2025]
This groundbreaking randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of vitamin K2 and D3 supplementation 
on Long COVID symptoms and associated biomarkers. Here are the key findings:
__~~#00F:Study Design and Participants~~__
The trial included 151 participants with Long COVID, randomized 2:1 to receive either:
*Treatment group (n=98): Daily doses of 240μg vitamin K2 and 2000 IU vitamin D3
*Control group (n=53): Standard of care
+The median age was 46 years, with 71% female participants
__~~#00F:Key Resultss~~__
__Symptom Improvement__
*Treatment group showed a 7.1% decrease in Long COVID Index scores
*Control group showed a 7.2% increase in scores
*The vitamin K2/D3 group maintained stable symptom numbers while the control group experienced increases
__Biomarker Changes__
The treatment group showed significant reductions in:
*Oxidized LDL
*Inflammatory markers (sTNF-RI and sCD163)
*Fungal translocation marker (1,3)-β-d-glucan
__Safety and Compliance__
*The treatment was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events attributed to supplementation
*Good treatment adherence was demonstrated by increased vitamin D levels in the treatment group
__~~#00F:Clinical Significances~~__
This study represents the first clinical evidence that vitamin K2/D3 supplementation may effectively:
*Reduce Long COVID symptoms
*Improve gut permeability
*Decrease systemic inflammation
*Lower fungal translocation markers
The findings suggest that this safe, accessible intervention could provide a promising treatment option 
for individuals suffering from Long COVID, particularly given the current lack of approved treatments for this condition
