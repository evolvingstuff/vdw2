 **About 4 cents/day for battery and 6 cents per day for amplifier   
 - assuming it lasts about 5 years** 

 **My comments on Amazon Dec 2016** 

My first hearing amplifier.  (age 70)

Free iPad test showed 10X reduction in left ear in voice frequencies

No ear wax, but lots of tinnitus in left ear

Nice - but has a very tiny slot to control the amplification

Could not even see the slot with 8X magnifier, but could see it with 15X magnification.

It has a very short delay before turning on (and squealing) - about 2 seconds - would prefer 5 seconds

Tinnitus often goes away after a few hours with the amplifier.

First battery lasted 6 days - very low-cost batteries - 4 cents per day
