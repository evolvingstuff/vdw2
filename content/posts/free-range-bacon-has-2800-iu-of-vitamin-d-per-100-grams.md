The USDA has known this since the early 1980's.

Apparently [Italian pigs](http://www.ieo.it/bda2008/uk/Informativa.aspx) are generally "free range" - their bacon having up to 3600 IU of vitamin D per 100 grams

 **Now farmers just provide pigs with enough vitamin D to prevent their getting rickets** 

 **Wonder when pig farmers will get around to supplementing with enough vitamin D to provide benefits in humans**
