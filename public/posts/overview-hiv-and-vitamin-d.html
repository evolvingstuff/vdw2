Vitamin D has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, but little is known about the effects of supplementation in HIV. Our study investigates changes in immune activation and exhaustion markers after 12 months of supplementation in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected youth with vitamin D insufficiency.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>This is a randomized, active-control, double-blind trial investigating with 3 different vitamin D3 doses <a href=18,000%20(standard/active-control%20dose),%2060,000%20(moderate%20dose)%20and%20120,000%20IU/monthly%20(high%20dose)>18,000 (standard/active-control dose), 60,000 (moderate dose) and 120,000 IU/monthly (high dose)</a> in 8-26 year old HIV-infected youth on combination antiretroviral therapy with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations ≤30 ng/mL. Only subjects (N=51) who maintained an undetectable HIV-1 RNA over the 12-month study period were included in this analysis.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations and immune activation/exhaustion markers were not different between groups. By 12 months, 25(OH)D increased significantly within each dosing group with the greatest increase and most sustained concentrations ≥30 ng/mL in the high-dose group.</p><p>Overall, all measured markers decreased with</p><ul><li><p>CD4 activation (CD4+CD38+HLA-DR+),</p></li><li><p>CD8 activation (CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+),</p></li><li><p>CD4 exhaustion (CD4+CD38+HLA-DR+PD1+), and</p></li><li><p>inflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+) reaching statistical significance.</p></li></ul><p>When analyzed separately, there were no significant decreases in the moderate- or standard-dose groups, but CD4 and CD8 activation and inflammatory monocytes decreased significantly in the high-dose group.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation decreased markers of T-cell activation/exhaustion and monocyte activation in HIV-infected youth, with subjects given the highest dose (120,000 IU/month) showing the greatest decreases. These data suggest that high-dose vitamin D supplementation may attenuate immune activation and exhaustion and serve as adjuvant therapy to antiretroviral therapy in HIV.</p><hr><h3 id=pubmed-hiv-or-aids-and-vitamin-d--in-titlehttpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmedtermhiv5btitle5d20or20aids5btitle5d20and2022vitamin20d225btitle5d-262-items---sept-2021><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=((hiv%5BTitle%5D)%20OR%20aids%5BTitle%5D)%20AND%20%22vitamin%20d%22%5BTitle%5D">PubMed HIV or AIDS and &ldquo;Vitamin D&rdquo; in title)</a>) 262 items - Sept 2021</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716863?dopt=Abstract">Severe Vitamin D Deficiency in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Pregnant Women is Associated with Preterm Birth</a></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Preterm birth 4.7 X</strong> more likely if HIV and low vitamin D.

Defined as levels less than 30?ng/mL, suboptimal vitamin D is known to afflict over 70% of representative samples from each group in resource-rich countries with even greater prevalence in resource-poor regions of the world.</p><p>In both those with and without HIV, dark skin, low vitamin D intake, exiguous exposure to sunlight, and season act as risk factors for suboptimal vitamin D levels.</p><p>In those infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy, particularly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), increase risk for low vitamin D as well.</p><p>Furthermore, metabolic aberrations, including obesity and hyperlipidemia, and miscellaneous risk factors, such as advanced AIDS and substance abuse, have been linked to suboptimal vitamin D in those with HIV.</p><p>While the skeletal and cardiovascular systems of HIV patients may be adversely impacted as a result of low levels, recent data have also linked low vitamin D to decreased CD4 counts, higher viral loads, and to critical end points including progression to AIDS events and death. More research is needed to confirm these potential consequences of low vitamin D in those with HIV and to discern the benefits of routine screening for and treatment of low vitamin D in this population.</p><hr><h3 id=hiv-susceptability-not-associated-with-vitamin-d>HIV susceptability not associated with Vitamin D</h3><p><strong>Vitamin D Levels, Natural H1N1 Infection and Response to H1N1 Vaccine among HIV-Infected Individuals</strong></p><p>J AIDS Clinic Res 2012, 3:5 <a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-6113.1000152>http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-6113.1000152</a></p><p>Florence Momplaisir 1, Ian Frank 2, WA Meyer III 3, Deborah Kim 2, Rosemary Kappes 2 and Pablo Tebas 2</p><p>1 Division of General Internal Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA</p><p>2 Division of Infectious Diseases, AIDS Clinical Trials Unit, Center for AIDS Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA</p><p>3 Quest Diagnostics, Baltimore, Maryland, USA</p><p>Background: Beyond its role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D plays a critical role in immunological responses to pathogens.

We tested the hypothesis of an independent relationship between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) and high-sensitivity <strong>C-reactive protein (CRP)</strong> in a cohort of HIV-positive people. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 316 HIV-positive people (181 men and 135 women) aged 16 to 60 years residing in the Kathmandu Valley, <strong>Nepal</strong> . Serum high-sensitivity CRP concentrations and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured by the latex agglutination nephelometry method and the competitive protein-binding assay, respectively.

The primary outcome (WHO stage 3/4 disease or death within 96 weeks of cART initiation) was met by 192 cases, and 152 and 29 cases met secondary outcomes of virologic and immunologic failure. We studied prevalence and risk factors for baseline low 25(OH)D (&lt;32 ng/mL) and examined associated outcomes using proportional hazard models.</p><p>Results. Low 25(OH)D prevalence was 49% and ranged from 27% in Brazil to 78% in Thailand. Low 25(OH)D was associated with high BMI, winter/spring season, country-race group, and lower viral load. Baseline low 25(OH)D was associated with increased risk of HIV progression and death (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) <strong>2.13;</strong> 95% CI: 1.09-4.18) and virologic failure (aHR 2.42; 95% CI 1.33-4.41).</p><p>Conclusions. Low 25(OH)D is common in diverse HIV-infected populations and is an independent risk factor for clinical and virologic failure.

Since life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals has increased, mostly as a result of advances in diagnosis and treatment, they are more willing to develop long-term chronic complications, some of which have been associated with vitamin D deficiency.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-and-hiv-infection---systematic-review---march-2014.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=hiv---4000-and-7000-iu-vitamin-d-were-safe-and-effective---feb-2015>HIV - 4,000 and 7,000 IU Vitamin D were safe and effective - Feb 2015</h3><p><strong>Vitamin D₃ supplementation in Batswana children and adults with HIV: a pilot double blind randomized controlled trial.</strong></p><p>PLoS One. 2015 Feb 23;10(2):e0117123. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117123.>doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0117123.</a> eCollection 2015.</p><p>Steenhoff AP1, Schall JI2, Samuel J2, Seme B3, Marape M4, Ratshaa B3, Goercke I3, Tolle M4, Nnyepi MS5, Mazhani L6, Zemel BS7, Rutstein RM8, Stallings VA7.</p><p><strong>Vitamin D Response varied with HIV ART being used</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/response-vs-art.jpg alt=image><p>OBJECTIVES:</p><p>Since vitamin D insufficiency is common worldwide in people with HIV, we explored safety and efficacy of high dose cholecalciferol (D₃) in Botswana, and evaluated potential modifiers of serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D change (Δ25D).</p><p>DESIGN:</p><p>Prospective randomized double-blind 12-week pilot trial of subjects ages 5.0-50.9 years.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>Sixty subjects randomized within five age groups to either 4000 or 7000 IU per day of D₃ and evaluated for vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, HIV, safety and growth status. Efficacy was defined as serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25D) ≥32 ng/mL, and safety as no simultaneous elevation of serum calcium and 25D. Also assessed were HIV plasma viral RNA viral load (VL), CD4%, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) regime, and height-adjusted (HAZ), weight-adjusted (WAZ) and Body Mass Index (BMIZ) Z scores.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Subjects were 50% male, age (mean±SD) 19.5±11.8 years, CD4% 31.8±10.4, with baseline VL log₁₀ range of &lt;1.4 to 3.8 and VL detectable (>1.4) in 22%. From baseline to 12 weeks, 25D increased from 36±9 ng/ml to 56±18 ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001) and 68% and 90% had 25D ≥32 ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.02). Δ25D was similar by dose. No subjects had simultaneously increased serum calcium and 25D. WAZ and BMIZ improved by 12 weeks (p&lt;0.04). HAZ and CD4% increased and VL decreased in the 7000 IU/d group (p&lt;0.04). Younger (5-13y) and older (30-50y) subjects had greater Δ25D than those 14-29y (26±17 and 28±12 vs. 11±11 ng/ml, respectively, p≤0.001).

However, emerging evidence supports the role of vitamin D beyond its recognised traditional roles. In pregnancy, vitamin D levels are crucial in sustaining both the maternal stores and optimal growth of the foetus. In Southern Africa, there is paucity of data on vitamin D in pregnancy and related outcomes. To expand this body of knowledge, we assessed vitamin D levels in late pregnancy and (if any) associated maternal determinants in Harare, Zimbabwe.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Study participants comprised of 138 pregnant Zimbabwean women in their third trimester. These were stratified by HIV status; sampling median (IQR) gestation for HIV negative study participants was 34 weeks (26–41) and 31 weeks (20–40) in the HIV positive participants.</p><p>Maternal plasma 25 hydroxyvitamin (OH) Dlevels were measured using the ClinPrepHigh Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) kit. Statistical analysis was carried out using the STATA statistical package version 13. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>Results</p><p>HIV infected participants had significantly higher mean 25 (OH) D concentration ( <strong>112</strong>  ± 33.4 nmol/L) compared to the HIV uninfected ( <strong>100</strong>  ± 27.1 nmol/L), p = 0.032.Participants whose samples were collected during summer had higher maternal 25 (OH) D levels than those cART duration and maternal 25 (OH) D levels (p = 0.031, Spearman correlation =0.28).</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Our findings show high mean levels of maternal 25 (OH) D in late pregnancy in our setting and in the absence of vitamin D supplementation. Both HIV infection and season are significant determinants of maternal vitamin D levels. Summer season is associated with higher maternal plasma 25 (OH) D levels. HIV infection is associated with increased maternal vitamin D levels. Prolonged use of cART, Tenolam E is associated with improved maternal 25(OH) D levels.</p><hr><h3 id=hiv-vaccine-trials-in-africa-failed-placebo-did-better---july-2024>HIV vaccine trials in Africa failed, placebo did better - July 2024</h3><p><strong><a href=https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/large-multi-year-clinical-trial-in-eastern-and-southern-africa-testing-two-hiv-vax-regimen-failplacebo-performs-better-30a385a6TrialSiteNews>https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/large-multi-year-clinical-trial-in-eastern-and-southern-africa-testing-two-hiv-vax-regimen-failplacebo-performs-better-30a385a6TrialSiteNews</a> 4 years, 2 vaccines</strong></p><hr><h3 id=does-the-hiv-virus-actually-exist---oct-2024>Does the HIV virus actually exist? - Oct 2024</h3><p><strong><a href="https://unbekoming.substack.com/p/hiv-a-virus-like-no-other?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=355417&amp;post_id=149985014&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=ofo3r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email%20">HIV - a virus like no other</a> Unbekoming Substack</strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/bacteria.html><span class=tag>bacteria</span></a>
