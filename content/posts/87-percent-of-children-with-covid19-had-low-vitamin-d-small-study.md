Objectives: To perform a comprehensive clinic, laboratory and instrumental evaluation of children affected by COVID-19.

Methods: Children with a positive result of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 underwent laboratory tests, anal and conjunctival swab, electrocardiography, lung, abdomen and cardiac ultrasound. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed if abnormal basal blood pressure. Patients were followed-up for 6 months.

Results: 316 children were evaluated; 15 were finally included. Confirmed family member SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in all. 27% were asymptomatic. Anal and conjunctival swabs tests resulted negative in all. Patients with lower BMI presented significantly higher viral loads. 

Main laboratory abnormalities were: 

* LDH increasing (73%), 

*  **low vitamin D levels (87%)** 

* hematuria (33%), 

* proteinuria (26%),

* renal hyperfiltration (33%) and 

* hypofiltration (13%). 

Two of the patients with hyperfiltration exhibited high blood pressure levels at diagnosis, and persistence of a prehypertension at 6-month follow-up. No abnormalities were seen at ultrasound, excepting for one patient who exhibited B-lines at lung sonography. IgG seroconversion was observed in all at 1-month.

Conclusions: Our study confirm that intra-family transmission is important. The significant higher viral loads recorded among patients with lower BMI, together with low vitamin D levels, support the impact of nutritional status on immune system. Renal involvement is frequent even among children with mild COVID-19, therefore prompt evaluation and identification of patients with reduced renal function reserve would allow a better stratification and management of patients. Seroconversion occurs also in asymptomatic children, with no differences in antibodies titer according to age, sex and clinical manifestations.
