Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the general population and is associated with various chronic health conditions. In addition to its role in bone mineralization, Vitamin D has various physiological effects that may impact the pathogenesis of shoulder pathologies. Vita­min D deficiency may also affect outcomes after shoulder surgeries, such as rotator cuff repair and total shoulder arthroplasty. Vitamin D plays a role in tissue healing, bone growth, and maintenance of homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. Vitamin D also has anti-inflammatory effects that are important to rotator cuff health. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with rotator cuff tears, suggesting its role as a potential risk factor. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with decreased preoperative shoulder strength as well as increased re-tear rates, postoperative stiffness, and the need for revision surgery in patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. Studies have also demonstrated a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of revision after total shoulder arthroplasty. 

Further research is necessary to elucidate the direct role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of rotator cuff tears and its impact on clinical outcomes af­ter rotator cuff surgery and total shoulder arthroplasty.

Background

The benefits of vitamin D encompass the augmentation of rotator cuff healing, the enhancement of bone mineral density (BMD), and the fortification of skeletal muscle strength. The vitamin D deficiency in Asian countries appears to be more severe compared to their Western counterparts. This study aims to ascertain the relationship between rotator cuff tears and vitamin D levels in the urban Thai elderly demographic. Our hypothesis posits that vitamin D deficiency will exhibit an association with the occurrence of rotator cuff tears.

Materials and methods

A prospective clinical trial conducted at a single tertiary was carried out to assess the patients experiencing shoulder pain who were aged 60 years or older. All participants were tested of blood specimens for calciferol concentration and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The duration between blood sample collection and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not exceed a two-week window. The assessment of fatty degeneration in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles, as well as tear dimensions and cartilage thickness, was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging within the outpatient clinic.

Results

The analysis of serum vitamin D levels within a cohort comprising 59 subjects produced significant observations, indicating that 20.03% of the participants manifested a deficiency in vitamin D and 44.07% exhibited insufficiency in vitamin D levels. There was no observed correlation between serum vitamin D levels and various patient parameters, including age (P = .99), body mass index (P = 0.31), tear size (P = 0.41), cartilage thickness at different locations on the humeral head (superior, middle, inferior, and total) (P = 0.31, 0.40, 0.26, 0.20, respectively), degree of fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff (P = 0.81), and severity of the rotator cuff condition (P = 0.13). A significant positive correlation was established between rotator cuff tear size and both the severity of the rotator cuff condition (P < 0.001) and the degree of fatty infiltration of the cuff (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

A negative correlation is observed between serum vitamin D levels and various parameters, including tear size, fatty infiltration, cartilage thickness, and the severity of rotator cuff tears within the elderly urban Thai population. To affirm these findings, it is imperative to conduct additional research and integrate vitamin D assessments into the management strategies for aging populations with rotator cuff conditions.

#### Cost of rotator cuff surgery reduced $46 if give a small amount of Vitamin D to all patients - Dec 2023

Preoperative vitamin D supplementation is a cost-effective intervention in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair

J. of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Vol 32, Issue 12, Dec 2023, Pages 2473-2482  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007 PDF behind paywall

Background

This study investigates the potential role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective strategy to decrease revision rotator cuff repair (RCR) rates and lower the total health care burden from patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR. Previous literature has emphasized the importance of vitamin D on bone health maintenance, soft tissue healing, and outcomes in RCR. Inadequate preoperative vitamin D levels may increase revision RCR rates following primary arthroscopic RCR. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is common in RCR patients, serum screening is not routinely performed.

Methods

A cost-estimation model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of both preoperative selective and nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation in RCR patients in order to reduce revision RCR rates. Prevalence and surgical cost data were obtained from published literature through systematic reviews. Cost of serum 25(OH)D assay and supplementation were obtained from public-use data. Mean and lower and upper bounds of 1-year cost savings were calculated for both the selective and nonselective supplementation scenarios.

Results

Preoperative 25(OH)D screening and subsequent selective 25(OH)D supplementation was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $6,099,341 (range: –$2,993,000 to $15,191,683) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation of all arthroscopic RCR patients was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $11,584,742 (range: $2,492,401-$20,677,085) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Univariate adjustment projects that selective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical contexts where the cost of revision RCR exceeds $14,824.69 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency exceeds 6.67%. Additionally, nonselective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical scenarios where revision RCR cost is ≥$4216.06 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency is ≥1.93%.

Conclusions

This cost-predictive model promotes the role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective mechanism to reduce revision RCR rates and lower the overall health care burden from arthroscopic RCR. Nonselective supplementation appears to be more cost-effective than selective supplementation, likely due to the lower cost of 25(OH)D supplementation compared to serum assays.

Systematic review: prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in primary RCR and prevalence of revision RCR in vitamin D–deficient and vitamin D–sufficient patients

A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to determine the prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency in all primary arthroscopic RCR patients and the prevalence of revision RCR in both vitamin D–deficient and vitamin D–sufficient patients. The following key words were used for query: rotator cuff repair, vitamin D. After manual review of the 14 resulting studies, only 3 reported the prevalence of . . . 

Results

Input data for our cost-predictive Markov model is outlined in Table I. Using this data, selective preoperative vitamin D screening and supplementation was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $6,099,341 (range: –$2,993,000 to $15,191,683) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases relative to the no supplementation scenario. Additionally, nonselective preoperative vitamin D supplementation of all patients was projected to result in a mean cost savings of $11,584,742 (range: . . .

Discussion

This analysis is the first cost-effectiveness study of a vitamin D supplementation–based intervention to reduce revision RCR rates and lower total US health care burden within the arthroscopic RCR population. Our model projects that both nonselective and selective 25(OH)D supplementation can be cost-effective preoperative interventions to reduce revision RCR rates and decrease total health care spending surrounding arthroscopic RCR. This finding builds on previous work associated with vitamin D . . . 

Conclusion

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis, bone-to-tendon healing, and the maintenance of bone and muscle health. Previous literature suggests that inadequate vitamin D levels are associated with increased revision RCR rates following arthroscopic RCR. We developed a cost-predictive Markov model that supports the potential role of both selective and nonselective preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as cost-effective strategies to decrease revision RCR rates and lower the total US . . .

Vitamin D plays a role in tissue healing, bone growth, and maintenance of homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. Vitamin D also has anti-inflammatory effects that are important to rotator cuff health. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with rotator cuff tears, suggesting its role as a potential risk factor. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with decreased preoperative shoulder strength as well as increased re-tear rates, postoperative stiffness, and the need for revision surgery in patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. Studies have also demonstrated a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of revision after total shoulder arthroplasty. \nFurther research is necessary to elucidate the direct role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of rotator cuff tears and its impact on clinical outcomes af­ter rotator cuff surgery and total shoulder arthroplasty.\n`

The vitamin D deficiency in Asian countries appears to be more severe compared to their Western counterparts. This study aims to ascertain the relationship between rotator cuff tears and vitamin D levels in the urban Thai elderly demographic. Our hypothesis posits that vitamin D deficiency will exhibit an association with the occurrence of rotator cuff tears.\nMaterials and methods\nA prospective clinical trial conducted at a single tertiary was carried out to assess the patients experiencing shoulder pain who were aged 60 years or older. All participants were tested of blood specimens for calciferol concentration and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The duration between blood sample collection and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not exceed a two-week window. The assessment of fatty degeneration in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles, as well as tear dimensions and cartilage thickness, was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging within the outpatient clinic.\nResults\nThe analysis of serum vitamin D levels within a cohort comprising 59 subjects produced significant observations, indicating that 20.03% of the participants manifested a deficiency in vitamin D and 44.07% exhibited insufficiency in vitamin D levels. There was no observed correlation between serum vitamin D levels and various patient parameters, including age (P = .99), body mass index (P = 0.31), tear size (P = 0.41), cartilage thickness at different locations on the humeral head (superior, middle, inferior, and total) (P = 0.31, 0.40, 0.26, 0.20, respectively), degree of fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff (P = 0.81), and severity of the rotator cuff condition (P = 0.13). A significant positive correlation was established between rotator cuff tear size and both the severity of the rotator cuff condition (P &lt; 0.001) and the degree of fatty infiltration of the cuff (P &lt; 0.001).\nConclusion\nA negative correlation is observed between serum vitamin D levels and various parameters, including tear size, fatty infiltration, cartilage thickness, and the severity of rotator cuff tears within the elderly urban Thai population.

Previous literature has emphasized the importance of vitamin D on bone health maintenance, soft tissue healing, and outcomes in RCR. Inadequate preoperative vitamin D levels may increase revision RCR rates following primary arthroscopic RCR. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is common in RCR patients, serum screening is not routinely performed.\n\nMethods\nA cost-estimation model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of both preoperative selective and nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation in RCR patients in order to reduce revision RCR rates. Prevalence and surgical cost data were obtained from published literature through systematic reviews. Cost of serum 25(OH)D assay and supplementation were obtained from public-use data. Mean and lower and upper bounds of 1-year cost savings were calculated for both the selective and nonselective supplementation scenarios.\n\nResults\nPreoperative 25(OH)D screening and subsequent selective 25(OH)D supplementation was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $6,099,341 (range: –$2,993,000 to $15,191,683) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation of all arthroscopic RCR patients was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $11,584,742 (range: $2,492,401-$20,677,085) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Univariate adjustment projects that selective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical contexts where the cost of revision RCR exceeds $14,824.69 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency exceeds 6.67%. Additionally, nonselective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical scenarios where revision RCR cost is ≥$4216.06 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency is ≥1.93%.\n\nConclusions\nThis cost-predictive model promotes the role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective mechanism to reduce revision RCR rates and lower the overall health care burden from arthroscopic RCR. Nonselective supplementation appears to be more cost-effective than selective supplementation, likely due to the lower cost of 25(OH)D supplementation compared to serum assays.\n\nSection snippets\nSystematic review: prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in primary RCR and prevalence of revision RCR in vitamin D–deficient and vitamin D–sufficient patients\nA systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to determine the prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency in all primary arthroscopic RCR patients and the prevalence of revision RCR in both vitamin D–deficient and vitamin D–sufficient patients.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the general population and is associated with various chronic health conditions. In addition to its role in bone mineralization, Vitamin D has various physiological effects that may impact the pathogenesis of shoulder pathologies. Vita­min D deficiency may also affect outcomes after shoulder surgeries, such as rotator cuff repair and total shoulder arthroplasty. Vitamin D plays a role in tissue healing, bone growth, and maintenance of homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. Vitamin D also has anti-inflammatory effects that are important to rotator cuff health. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with rotator cuff tears, suggesting its role as a potential risk factor. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with decreased preoperative shoulder strength as well as increased re-tear rates, postoperative stiffness, and the need for revision surgery in patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. Studies have also demonstrated a potential association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of revision after total shoulder arthroplasty. 
Further research is necessary to elucidate the direct role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of rotator cuff tears and its impact on clinical outcomes af­ter rotator cuff surgery and total shoulder arthroplasty.

Background
The benefits of vitamin D encompass the augmentation of rotator cuff healing, the enhancement of bone mineral density (BMD), and the fortification of skeletal muscle strength. The vitamin D deficiency in Asian countries appears to be more severe compared to their Western counterparts. This study aims to ascertain the relationship between rotator cuff tears and vitamin D levels in the urban Thai elderly demographic. Our hypothesis posits that vitamin D deficiency will exhibit an association with the occurrence of rotator cuff tears.
Materials and methods
A prospective clinical trial conducted at a single tertiary was carried out to assess the patients experiencing shoulder pain who were aged 60 years or older. All participants were tested of blood specimens for calciferol concentration and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The duration between blood sample collection and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not exceed a two-week window. The assessment of fatty degeneration in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles, as well as tear dimensions and cartilage thickness, was conducted using magnetic resonance imaging within the outpatient clinic.
Results
The analysis of serum vitamin D levels within a cohort comprising 59 subjects produced significant observations, indicating that 20.03% of the participants manifested a deficiency in vitamin D and 44.07% exhibited insufficiency in vitamin D levels. There was no observed correlation between serum vitamin D levels and various patient parameters, including age (P = .99), body mass index (P = 0.31), tear size (P = 0.41), cartilage thickness at different locations on the humeral head (superior, middle, inferior, and total) (P = 0.31, 0.40, 0.26, 0.20, respectively), degree of fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff (P = 0.81), and severity of the rotator cuff condition (P = 0.13). A significant positive correlation was established between rotator cuff tear size and both the severity of the rotator cuff condition (P &lt; 0.001) and the degree of fatty infiltration of the cuff (P &lt; 0.001).
Conclusion
A negative correlation is observed between serum vitamin D levels and various parameters, including tear size, fatty infiltration, cartilage thickness, and the severity of rotator cuff tears within the elderly urban Thai population. To affirm these findings, it is imperative to conduct additional research and integrate vitamin D assessments into the management strategies for aging populations with rotator cuff conditions.

!!!!Cost of rotator cuff surgery reduced $46 if give a small amount of Vitamin D to all patients - Dec 2023
Preoperative vitamin D supplementation is a cost-effective intervention in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair
J. of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Vol 32, Issue 12, Dec 2023, Pages 2473-2482  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007 PDF behind paywall

Background
This study investigates the potential role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective strategy to decrease revision rotator cuff repair (RCR) rates and lower the total health care burden from patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR. Previous literature has emphasized the importance of vitamin D on bone health maintenance, soft tissue healing, and outcomes in RCR. Inadequate preoperative vitamin D levels may increase revision RCR rates following primary arthroscopic RCR. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is common in RCR patients, serum screening is not routinely performed.

Methods
A cost-estimation model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of both preoperative selective and nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation in RCR patients in order to reduce revision RCR rates. Prevalence and surgical cost data were obtained from published literature through systematic reviews. Cost of serum 25(OH)D assay and supplementation were obtained from public-use data. Mean and lower and upper bounds of 1-year cost savings were calculated for both the selective and nonselective supplementation scenarios.

Results
Preoperative 25(OH)D screening and subsequent selective 25(OH)D supplementation was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $6,099,341 (range: –$2,993,000 to $15,191,683) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation of all arthroscopic RCR patients was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $11,584,742 (range: $2,492,401-$20,677,085) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Univariate adjustment projects that selective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical contexts where the cost of revision RCR exceeds $14,824.69 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency exceeds 6.67%. Additionally, nonselective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical scenarios where revision RCR cost is ≥$4216.06 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency is ≥1.93%.

Conclusions
This cost-predictive model promotes the role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective mechanism to reduce revision RCR rates and lower the overall health care burden from arthroscopic RCR. Nonselective supplementation appears to be more cost-effective than selective supplementation, likely due to the lower cost of 25(OH)D supplementation compared to serum assays.

Systematic review: prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in primary RCR and prevalence of revision RCR in vitamin D–deficient and vitamin D–sufficient patients
A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to determine the prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency in all primary arthroscopic RCR patients and the prevalence of revision RCR in both vitamin D–deficient and vitamin D–sufficient patients. The following key words were used for query: rotator cuff repair, vitamin D. After manual review of the 14 resulting studies, only 3 reported the prevalence of . . . 

Results
Input data for our cost-predictive Markov model is outlined in Table I. Using this data, selective preoperative vitamin D screening and supplementation was calculated to result in a mean cost savings of $6,099,341 (range: –$2,993,000 to $15,191,683) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases relative to the no supplementation scenario. Additionally, nonselective preoperative vitamin D supplementation of all patients was projected to result in a mean cost savings of $11,584,742 (range: . . .

Discussion
This analysis is the first cost-effectiveness study of a vitamin D supplementation–based intervention to reduce revision RCR rates and lower total US health care burden within the arthroscopic RCR population. Our model projects that both nonselective and selective 25(OH)D supplementation can be cost-effective preoperative interventions to reduce revision RCR rates and decrease total health care spending surrounding arthroscopic RCR. This finding builds on previous work associated with vitamin D . . . 

Conclusion
Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis, bone-to-tendon healing, and the maintenance of bone and muscle health. Previous literature suggests that inadequate vitamin D levels are associated with increased revision RCR rates following arthroscopic RCR. We developed a cost-predictive Markov model that supports the potential role of both selective and nonselective preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as cost-effective strategies to decrease revision RCR rates and lower the total US . . .
