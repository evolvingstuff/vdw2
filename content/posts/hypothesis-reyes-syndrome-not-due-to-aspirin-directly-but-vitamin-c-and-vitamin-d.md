## Great article by Bill Sardi [Why Reyes-syndrome prevailed then suddenly disappeared](http://knowledgeofhealth.com/why-reyes-syndrome-prevailed-then-suddenly-disappeared/#more-338)

There was a big scare of aspirin use by children in the 1980's

People switched to using Tylenol (a liver toxin)

It appears that aspirin decreased vitamin C, which caused the Reyes problem for children

The problem went away when everyone started taking Vitamin C - due to Linus Pauling

## It appears that Reyes Syndrome is also related to vitamin D deficiency

The following graph from NEJM 1999 shows the strong relationship between Reyes Syndrome and season for those with dark skins
