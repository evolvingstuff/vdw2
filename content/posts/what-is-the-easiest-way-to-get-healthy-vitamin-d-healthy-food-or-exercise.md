#### Let us assume, for argument, that they result in similar health benefits

##### Now let us estimate the monthly costs and time for each.

Does include: purchase, preparation, use, and cleanup

Does not include travel (time or cost)

 **| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | COST per month | HOUR per month |
| Vitamin D | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $0.50 | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  0.2 hour |
| Healthy Food | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $200 <br> <span style="color:#690;">Vit D is 400X lower cost</span>  | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30 hour<br><span style="color:#690;">Vit D takes 150X less time</span> |
| Exercise | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $30 <br><span style="color:#690;">Vit D is 60X lower cost</span>     | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 hour<br><span style="color:#690;">Vit D takes 50X less time</span> |** 

 **Thus, assuming that they have the same health benefits,  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Vitamin D is at least 50X better use of our time and 30X lower cost.**
