**Claims a 90% success rate in placebo controlled trial, based on 164 people getting COVID-19** 

This apparently means that of those getting injected who got infected

* 16 (10% of 164) of the infected people had gotten the vaccine

* 145 (90% of 164) of the infected people had gotten the placebo

 **Problems** 

1. Vaccine requires 2nd shot 3 weeks after the first

1. Trial only considered people who got symptoms and then tested positive for COVID-19

   * A vaccinated person could perhaps be more likely to have asymptomatic infection and spread to other people

1. Do Not know if vaccine reduces COVID-19 severity or death

1. [Vaccine must be stored at extremely cold temperatures (-94 degrees)](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/pfizer-moderna-s-covid-19-shot-rollouts-could-be-ice-as-analysts-question-cold)

   * [“There’s no historical precedent for us maintaining vaccines on dry ice in the United States. That’s never happened,”](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/10/13/deep-freezers-and-dry-ice-for-pfizer-vaccine-may-face-shortages/%20)

1. Many of the people [excluded by the trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728?term=Pfizer+BioNTech+Phase+3&cond=COVID-19+OR+SARS-CoV-2+Virus&draw=2&rank=1) had conditions associated with low vitamin D

   * expect that the results can be different when the vaccines are injected into people with low vitamin D levels

1. People getting vaccination might have more serious infections than people getting placebo

   * Press release did not mention ([antibody-dependent enhancement](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/11/18/first-covid-19-vaccine-90-percent-effective.aspx?ui=d738e3df52a8a14aea9298fe6ec5bc113ed0d6d7922f31861727d54a43cbe29d&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20201118&mid=DM723337&rid=1014245608))

1. No indication how many of the COVId-19 strains it protects against

   * Example: Vaccination might provide protection against strains A, B, C but much less protction against D, E, or F
