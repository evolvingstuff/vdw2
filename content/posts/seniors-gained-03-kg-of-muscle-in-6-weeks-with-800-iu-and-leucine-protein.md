#### Supplementing Breakfast with a Vitamin D and Leucine–Enriched Whey Protein Medical Nutrition Drink Enhances Postprandial Muscle Protein Synthesis and Muscle Mass in Healthy Older Men

800 IU is a tiny amount of Vitamin D for seniors

VitaminDWiki expects that far more muscle mass would have been gained if either of the following

* Had achieved a good Vitamin D level in days, not months 

> with a loading dose of perhaps 300,000 IU

* Had used higher daily dose of vitamin D - perhaps 5X higher = 4,000 IU

Background: A promising strategy to help older adults preserve or build muscle mass is to optimize muscle anabolism through providing an adequate amount of high-quality protein at each meal.

Objective: This “proof of principle” study investigated the acute effect of supplementing breakfast with a vitamin D and leucine–enriched whey protein medical nutrition drink on postprandial muscle protein synthesis and longer-term effect on muscle mass in healthy older adults.

Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 24 healthy older men [mean ± SD: age 71 ± 4 y; body mass index (in kg/m2) 24.7 ± 2.8](mean%20±%20SD:%20age%2071%20±%204%20y;%20body%20mass%20index%20(in%20kg/m2)%2024.7%20±%202.8) between September 2012 and October 2013 at the Unit of Human Nutrition, University of Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France. Participants received a medical nutrition drink <span>[test group; 21 g leucine-enriched whey protein, 9 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat, 800 IU cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), and 628 kJ]</span> or a noncaloric placebo (control group) before breakfast for 6 wk. Mixed muscle protein  **fractional synthesis rate (FSR)**  was measured at week 0 in the basal and postprandial state, after study product intake with a standardized breakfast with the use of L-<span>[2H5]</span>-phenylalanine tracer methodology. The longer-term effect of the medical nutrition drink was evaluated by measurement of appendicular lean mass, representing skeletal muscle mass at weeks 0 and 6, by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Results: Postprandial FSR (0–240 min) was higher in the test group than in the control group [estimate of difference (ED): 0.022%/h; 95% CI: 0.010%/h, 0.035%/h; ANCOVA, P = 0.001](estimate%20of%20difference%20(ED):%200.022%/h;%2095%%20CI:%200.010%/h,%200.035%/h;%20ANCOVA,%20P%20=%200.001). 

The test group gained more appendicular lean mass than the control group after 6 wk 

* (ED: 0.37 kg; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.72 kg; ANCOVA, P = 0.035), 

* predominantly as leg lean mass (ED: 0.30 kg; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.57 kg; ANCOVA, P = 0.034).

Conclusions: Supplementing breakfast with a vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein medical nutrition drink stimulated postprandial muscle protein synthesis and increased muscle mass after 6 wk of intervention in healthy older adults and may therefore be a way to support muscle preservation in older people.
