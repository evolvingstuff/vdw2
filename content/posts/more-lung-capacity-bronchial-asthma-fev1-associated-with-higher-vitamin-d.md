Background

Many studies have suggested the role of vitamin D deficiency in both T-helper1 and T-helper2 diseases. The existence of associations of vitamin D with asthma and allergy remains uncertain. While some suggest that vitamin D may be protective, others suggest that vitamin D supplementation may increase the risk of allergy.

Aim of the work

The aim of the study was to evaluate the state of vitamin D in asthmatic patients and its potential relationship with asthma phenotypes.

Patients and methods

This study was conducted on 66 nonsmoker asthmatic patients and 30 healthy controls. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels were determined and compared between the two groups. 

The relationship between serum vitamin D levels and asthma phenotypes were examined.

Results

Vitamin D level was significantly lower in asthmatic patients than in control group, in asthmatic patients, vitamin D levels had a significant positive correlation with FEV1% predicted and a significant negative correlation with body mass index, the number of atopic patients was significantly higher in bronchial asthma patients with vitamin D insufficiency than those with sufficient vitamin D.

Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in asthmatic patients and it was associated with atopy and asthma severity.
