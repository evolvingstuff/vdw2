#### COVID and T-Cell Studies from the web

 **Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19**   June 29

* Reported on by : [Immunity to COVID-19 is probably higher than tests have shown](https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown)

 **COVID-19 progression is potentially driven by T cell immunopathogenesis**  May 19, 2020

* "Our data further reveal that increased rather than decreased SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell immunity is associated with adverse outcome in COVID-19

 **Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Macrophage-Driven T Cell Dysfunction in Severe COVID-19 Patients**  May 26

* "Together, our results suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immune dysregulation by inducing M2 polarization and subsequent T cell exhaustion."

 **Impaired T cell functions along with elevated activated Tregs at the early stage of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection**  

* "Interpretation The T cell activation in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a significant suppression and presented impairment of Th1/Th17 and CD8+ T cell functions"
