#### [Only a Dozen Inspectors Stand Between Zika and Miami](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-01/swat-team-miami-s-mosquito-man-faces-zika-with-bare-bones-crew%20) Bloomberg

* With no federal funding the “swat team” is only able to clear the property of current mosquitoes of people who are currently suspected of having Zika infection.  

* Primarily by removing locations of standing water and use of larvicide

* They rarely deal with possible mosquitoes in property of neighbors

* They appear to be unaware that the Zika mosquito does not lay eggs in standing water like most other mosquitoes.

* “Leave out the birth defects and Zika is mild compared with Dengue, which can kill, and Chikungunya, which causes victims to hunch over in pain”

* Note - Miami county has a ban on spraying mosquitos as doing so would upset the ecosystem.

> This may be nullified by the state law

* Note: New mosquitos are hatched several times a month, but the “swat team” does not have funding for bi-weekly visits

* 1 "swat team" member per 200,000 population in county

> Brazil has 1 person by 1,000 population in country  (220,000 troups for population of 200 million)

*  **200X fewer "boots on the ground" to fight the enemy in the US** 

* Eggs laid “. . in the well at the bottom of the leaves of a bromeliad . . “
