The objective was to provide the current state of the art regarding the role of vitamin D in chronic diseases (osteoporosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, dementia, autism, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, male and female fertility). The document was drawn up by panelists that provided their contribution according to their own scientific expertise. Each scientific expert supplied a first draft manuscript on a specific aspect of the document’s topic that was subjected to voting by all experts as “yes” (agreement with the content and/or wording) or “no” (disagreement). The adopted rule was that statements supported by =75 % of votes would be immediately accepted, while those with <25 % would be rejected outright. Others would be subjected to further discussion and subsequent voting, where =67 % support or, in an eventual third round, a majority of =50 % would be needed. 

This document finds that the current evidence support a role for vitamin D in bone health but not in other health conditions. 

However, subjects with vitamin D deficiency have been found to be at  **high risk of developing chronic diseases** . Therefore, although at the present time there is not sufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D supplementation as treatment of chronic diseases, the treatment of vitamin D deficiency should be desiderable in order to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.
