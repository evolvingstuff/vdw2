VitaminDWiki does not know how to make a PDF from a translated page WHILE IT IS ON THE WEB.

You can, however, download some FREE software which PRINTS a page on your computer to a PDF File

After downloading and installing that software you can  **Print-to-PDF**  ANY page on your computer from any Windows program

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- including pages which have been translated.

 **[Cute PDF](http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp)**  is one of many such programs

 **Important notes:** 

1. While installing, be sure to UNCHECK ALL 3 of the ASK toolbar options - uncheck them from the bottom up

1. You do NOT need to download/try their PDF writer program.

1. The PDF created by Cute PDF is an image of what is on the page, and has NO active hyperlinks

1. All Print-to-PDF programs show up as new Printer options when you try to print any page

Another program:  **[PrimoPDF by Nitro](http://download.cnet.com/PrimoPDF/3000-18497_4-10264577.html?tag=mncol;4)** 

 **[Download.com seems to have 1300 PDF Print programs](http://download.cnet.com/1770-20_4-0.html?query=pdf+printer&searchtype=downloads&tag=mncol;rbxcdl.2.a.1)** 

There are probably similar Print-To-PDF programs for Apple, iPad, Kindle, Android, Linux, etc.
