The attached PDF is wrong is so many ways.

 **Here are a few** 

1. 10 minutes a day of sun on just forearms is enough vitamin D

1. Vitamin D2 should be used to build up low levels

1. Maintenane dose of just 1,000 IU of vitamin D3

1. Should not take 50,000 IU weekly if pregnant

1. No mention of how much to prevent MS

1. No mention of how much has been found to treat MS

They mention that the cost of a Vitamin D at the Cleland clinic is $205

(Test costs about $60 at many independent labs)
