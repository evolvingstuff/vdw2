### Infant formula 40 to 100 IU of vitamin D per 100K Calories

[FDA](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=5af2a35de1ba3464af55f53e369fd570;rgn=div6;view=text;node=21%3A2.0.1.1.7.4;idno=21;cc=ecfr)

Apparently need 100K calories per kg, which is 454 K calories per lb

So, a 10 lb baby getting 4540 K calories of formula would get  182 to 454 IU of vitamin D

[Every 2-oz. of Similac Advance contains 60 IU of vitamin D](http://www.livestrong.com/article/371720-similac-nutrition-information/%20)
