Aim

To determine whether vitamin D supplementation reduces primary care visits for acute respiratory infection (ARI).

Methods

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in New Zealand and powered to determine the vitamin D dose needed to achieve normal vitamin D status during infancy. Healthy pregnant women, from 27 weeks gestation to birth, and their infants, from birth to age 6 months, were assigned to placebo or one of two dosages of daily oral vitamin D3. Woman/infant pairs were randomised to: placebo/placebo, 1000IU/400IU, or 2000IU/800IU.For this ad hoc analysis, the primary care records of enrolled children were audited to age 18 months.

Results

Two-hundred-and-sixty pregnant women were randomised to placebo (n=87), lower-dose (n=87) or higher-dose (n=86) vitamin D3. In comparison with the placebo group  **(99%)** , the proportion of children making any ARI visits was smaller in the higher-dose  **(87%** , P=0.004), but not the lower-dose vitamin D3 group (95%, P=0.17). The median number of ARI visits/child was less in the higher-dose vitamin D3 group from age 6-18 months (placebo 4, lower-dose 3, higher-dose  **2.5** ; P=0.048 for higher-dose vitamin D3 vs. placebo).

Conclusion

Vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy and infancy reduces primary care visits for ARI during early childhood.
