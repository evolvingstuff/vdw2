Current literature regarding the association of vitamin D insufficiency and food allergy is contradicting. The purpose of our study was to investigate this association. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. PubMeD and Scopus databases were systematically searched for case–control studies investigating the association between pediatric food allergy and vitamin D insufficiency. Our search yielded 806 studies. Ten final studies were considered eligible for qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

* Children with vitamin D insufficiency were found to have 68% more probability to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled OR: 1.68, 95% CI <span>[1.25–2.27]</span>, p-value: 0.001). 

In their second year of life they were 

* 4 times more likely to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled  **OR: 4.06** , 95% CI <span>[1.93–8.56]</span>, p-value: < 0.001), and 

* 56% more probable to develop food sensitization (OR: 1.56, 95% CI <span>[1.15–2.11]</span>, p-value: < 0.004).

Children in Australia with vitamin D insufficiency were almost 4 times more likely to develop egg sensitization (adjusted OR: 3.79, 95% CI <span>[1.19–12.08]</span>, p-value: 0.024). Children with vitamin D insufficiency were almost twice as likely to have peanut sensitization (OR: 1.96, 95% CI <span>[1.08–3.57]</span>, p-value: 0.028).

Conclusion: Decreased maternal vitamin D levels and infant vitamin D insufficiency appear to increase the incidence of food allergies, particularly in the second year of life. To confirm this association, multicenter longitudinal studies are required.
