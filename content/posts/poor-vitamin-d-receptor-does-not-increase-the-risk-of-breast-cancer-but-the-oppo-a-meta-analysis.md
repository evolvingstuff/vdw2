#### Association between vitamin D receptor polymorphism and breast cancer in women: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational investigations

Experimental Gerontology, September 2024,  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2024.112502

 **Highlights** 

* This comprehensive review synthesizes evidence on VDR polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in women.

* Analysis includes 119 datasets from 17 meta-analyses on BsmI, 6 on Cdx2, and 6 on Poly (A) polymorphisms.

* Only 5 % of the analyzed datasets reported statistically significant associations.

* VDR polymorphisms (BsmI, Cdx-2, and Poly (A)) are not strongly linked to breast cancer risk.

This study aimed to conduct an umbrella review of meta-analyses to synthesize the existing evidence regarding the relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) risk. A comprehensive search was performed across multiple databases, including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science. The investigation included 17 meta-analyses for the BsmI polymorphism, 6 for the Cdx2 polymorphism, and 6 for the Poly (A) polymorphism. Among the 119 datasets analyzed, only 6 (5 %) reported statistically significant outcomes (p < 0.05), comprising 2 comparisons for VDR BsmI polymorphism (3 %), 1 for VDR Cdx-2 polymorphism (4 %), and 3 for VDR Poly (A) polymorphism (14 %), across various genetic models. Notably, significant heterogeneity was observed in 82 comparisons, and publication bias was detected in 16 comparisons. Furthermore, a substantial proportion (86 %) of the included studies exhibited critically low methodological quality. 

In conclusion, our findings suggest that VDR polymorphism (BsmI, Cdx-2, and Poly (A)) is not strongly associated with BC risk in the general population.

!!!!Association between vitamin D receptor polymorphism and breast cancer in women: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational investigations
Experimental Gerontology, September 2024,  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2024.112502

__Highlights__
*This comprehensive review synthesizes evidence on VDR polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in women.
*Analysis includes 119 datasets from 17 meta-analyses on BsmI, 6 on Cdx2, and 6 on Poly (A) polymorphisms.
*Only 5 % of the analyzed datasets reported statistically significant associations.
*VDR polymorphisms (BsmI, Cdx-2, and Poly (A)) are not strongly linked to breast cancer risk.
This study aimed to conduct an umbrella review of meta-analyses to synthesize the existing evidence regarding the relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) risk. A comprehensive search was performed across multiple databases, including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science. The investigation included 17 meta-analyses for the BsmI polymorphism, 6 for the Cdx2 polymorphism, and 6 for the Poly (A) polymorphism. Among the 119 datasets analyzed, only 6 (5 %) reported statistically significant outcomes (p &lt; 0.05), comprising 2 comparisons for VDR BsmI polymorphism (3 %), 1 for VDR Cdx-2 polymorphism (4 %), and 3 for VDR Poly (A) polymorphism (14 %), across various genetic models. Notably, significant heterogeneity was observed in 82 comparisons, and publication bias was detected in 16 comparisons. Furthermore, a substantial proportion (86 %) of the included studies exhibited critically low methodological quality. 
In conclusion, our findings suggest that VDR polymorphism (BsmI, Cdx-2, and Poly (A)) is not strongly associated with BC risk in the general population.
