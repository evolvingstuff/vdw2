1. It appears that 1/3 of everyone with a vitamin D-related disease has a poor VDR

1. A poor VDR cannot be detected by any standard Vitamin D test (nor Calcitriol nor Calcidiol)  

1. A poor Parathyroid VDR can be detected when high Calcitriol levels fail to decrease PTH levels

> Decreasing PTH shows Vitamin D is getting to Parathyroid - but says nothing about VDRs elsewhere

1. Many cancers and viruses have learned to protect themselves by deactivating the local VDR

1. A VDR activation decreases with age

 **Light activates VDR at conception,etc. - April 2017** 

 **[VDR gene methylation as a molecular adaption to light exposure: Historic, recent and genetic influences.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28432711?dopt=Abstract)** 

Am J Hum Biol. 2017 Apr 22. [doi: 10.1002/ajhb.23010](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23010)

Beckett EL1,2,3, Jones P1, Veysey M2,4, Duesing K3, Martin C1, Furst J5, Yates Z6, Jablonski NG7, Chaplin G7, Lucock M1.

OBJECTIVES:

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. We examined whether degree of VDR gene methylation acts as a molecular adaptation to light exposure. We explored this in the context of photoperiod at conception, recent UV irradiance at 305 nm, and gene-latitude effects.

METHODS:

Eighty subjects were examined for VDR gene-CpG island methylation density. VDR gene variants were also examined by PCR-RFLP.

RESULTS:

Photoperiod at conception was significantly positively related to VDR methylation density, explaining 17% of the variance in methylation (r2  = 0.17; P = .001). Within this model, photoperiod at conception and plasma 25(OH)D independently predicted methylation density at the VDR-CpG island. Recent UV exposure at 305 nm led to a fivefold increase in mean methylation density (P = .02). Again, UV exposure and plasma 25(OH)D independently predicted methylation density at the VDR-CpG island. In the presence of the BsmI mutant allele, methylation density was increased (P = .01), and in the presence of the TaqI or FokI mutant allele, methylation density was decreased (P = .007 and .04 respectively). Multivariate modeling suggests plasma 25(OH)D, photoperiod at conception, recent solar irradiance, and VDR genotype combine as independent predictors of methylation at the VDR-CpG island, explaining 34% of the variance in methylation (R2  = 0.34, P < .0001).

CONCLUSIONS:

Duration of early-life light exposure and strength of recent irradiance, along with latitudinal genetic factors, influence degree of VDR gene methylation consistent with this epigenetic phenomenon being a molecular adaptation to variation in ambient light exposure. Findings contribute to our understanding of human biology.

#### Ways to increase the VDR - Selfhacked

 **[Vitamin D Receptor Gene: Ways to Activate it, Calcitriol, Benefits](https://www.selfhacked.com/blog/natural-ways-to-increase-calcitrol-and-vitamin-d-receptor-gene-expression/) Self-hacked.com Aug 2018** 

 **A list of ways to Increase EITHER active Vitamin D or Vitamin D Receptor** 

 **Following subset list May include some non-VDR items by mistake** 

 **See self-hacked article for hyperlinks and details** 

* RXR (and retinol) is needed to produce proteins with the VDR.  1,25D3 binds to the VDR, which then combines with RXR to activate gene expression.  (Not all VDR-dependent genes need RXR.)

* SIRT1 -potentiates VDR <span>[R, R]</span> – acetylation of VDR lessens 1,25D/VDR signaling. SIRT1 increased the ability of VDR to associate with RXR.

* PGC-1a <span>[R]</span>– potentiates VDR.  It is a coactivator of the VDR, but it still needs 1,25D3.

* Dopamine <span>[R]</span>

* The VDR evolved from its ancient role as a detoxification nuclear receptor. LCA is produced from the gut bacteria (metabolizing liver-derived chenodeoxycholic acid). LCA travels to the colon, where the VDR binds to LCA or 1,25 D and activates the CYP3A4 and SULT2A genes facilitate disposal from the cell via the ABC efflux transporter <span>[R]</span>.

*  **Omega-3** : DHA, EPA <span>[R]</span>, – Fish oil/DHA

* Omega-6: γ-Linolenic acid, Arachidonic acid <span>[R]</span>,

*  **Curcumin**  <span>[R]</span>– Curcumin is more active than LCA/Bile in driving VDR-mediated transcription and that it binds to VDR with approximately the same affinity as LCA.

*  **Resveratrol**  <span>[R]</span> – Potentiates VDR by: (1) potentiating 1,25D binding to VDR; (2) activating RXR; (3) stimulating SIRT1.

* Gamma Tocotrienol <span>[R]</span>- Tocotrienols or Tocopherols (IHERB)

* Estradiol increases VDR expression <span>[R, R]</span> and calcitriol levels <span>[R]</span>.
