#### Omicron survives longer on some surfaces, studies find. That may help explain why it's more contagious, but it's no reason to panic

 **[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/health/omicron-surfaces-studies/index.html)** 

* "I think that maybe surfaces could be a little more important than they were with the ancestral strain. I still do not think that does not mean that surfaces are dominant, though,"

 **Lab studies of BA.1 (which is less contagious than BA.2)**

| Surface | Original | Omicron BA.1 |
| Plastic | 2 days | 8 days |
| Stainless Steel | 2 days | 7 days |

* "And in a study in Hong Kong, researchers estimated that during an outbreak of BA.2 in a public housing complex, the virus doubled every 1.28 days."

Note: Surface transmission becomes important when people are not wearing masks

1. Maskless infected person who is much more likely to leave a virus on a surface

1. Maskless victim touches the surface, then touches their face

Note: Infections not needing hospitalization can still result in long-haul for many months  or years
