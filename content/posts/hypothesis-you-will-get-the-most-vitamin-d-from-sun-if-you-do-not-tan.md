# Hypothesis – can concurrently:

1. Maximize the amount of vitamin D 

1. Minimize the risk of skin cancer / melanoma

## By the admin of the VitaminDWiki, June 2011

## Facts

* Tanning is one way for the skin to reduce the damaging effect of excessive UVB 

* Sun burn is another way that the body uses to stop excessive UVB

   * A sun burned person keeps out of the sun

   * Note: people who have frequently sunburned are 6X more likely to get skin cancer

* It appears possible to get vitamin D without much tanning

* The darker the tan, the less vitamin D which is produced by the skin.

## Also – at the end of the summer season un-tanned skin will generate much more vitamin D

### which will result in significantly higher levels of vitamin D in the fall and winter
