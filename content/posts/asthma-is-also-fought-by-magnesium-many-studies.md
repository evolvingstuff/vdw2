#### How does Magnesium fight asthma (prevent and treat) - asked [Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-does-magnesium-fight-asthm-VhkAQTKhSNe4l1NPWZKdVw)

Magnesium plays multiple important roles in both preventing and treating asthma through several key mechanisms:

 **Prevention Mechanisms** 

 **Anti-inflammatory Effects** 

Magnesium helps prevent asthma attacks by dampening inflammation in the airways and stabilizing mast cells&nbsp;[1](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/magnesium-asthma-relief-does-it-work)&nbsp;[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543098/)

It also blocks the release of chemicals that cause airway inflammation&nbsp;[9](https://www.myasthmateam.com/resources/magnesium-supplements-for-asthma-can-they-help)

 **Smooth Muscle Function** 

The mineral acts as a calcium channel blocker, helping to maintain relaxed bronchial smooth muscles and prevent constriction of airways&nbsp;[7](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/351639)&nbsp;[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543098/)

This bronchodilating effect is particularly important since asthma involves hyperresponsive airway smooth muscles&nbsp;[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6379356/)

 **Treatment Applications** 

 **Emergency Treatment** 

Intravenous magnesium sulfate serves as an effective emergency treatment when first-line therapies fail&nbsp;[6](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/0115/p127.html)

It reduces hospital admission rates by:

* 68% in children

* 25% in adults&nbsp;[6](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2019/0115/p127.html)

 **Therapeutic Mechanisms** 

During an acute asthma attack, magnesium provides relief through multiple pathways:

* Relaxes and opens constricted airways

* Blocks chemicals causing muscle spasms

* Increases nitric oxide levels to reduce inflammation

* Inhibits cholinergic neuromuscular transmission&nbsp;[1](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/magnesium-asthma-relief-does-it-work)&nbsp;[7](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/351639)

 **Supplementation Effects** 

 **Oral Supplements** 

Daily oral magnesium supplementation can improve:

* Peak expiratory flow rate

* Forced expiratory volume

* Overall lung function parameters&nbsp;[1](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/magnesium-asthma-relief-does-it-work)&nbsp;[3](https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erj/58/suppl65/pa887)

However, while some studies show promise for oral supplementation, more research is needed to definitively establish its effectiveness in preventing asthma attacks&nbsp;[1](https://www.webmd.com/asthma/magnesium-asthma-relief-does-it-work)&nbsp;[9](https://www.myasthmateam.com/resources/magnesium-supplements-for-asthma-can-they-help)

#### Causal effect of serum magnesium on the risk of 9 respiratory diseases: a Mendelian randomization study

preprint [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3342596/v1FREE PDF](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3342596/v1FREE%20PDF)

Jingtao Zhang, Yang Li, Zhaohao Huang, Zhiguo Chen, Xuxing Wu, and 1 more

Objective: Although the association between serum magnesium and respiratory diseases has been explored, the causal effects of serum magnesium on respiratory diseases are largely unknown. Here we performed a Mendelian randomization(MR) analysis to investigate the association between serum magnesium concentrations and risk of 9 respiratory diseases.

Methods: Mendelian randomization was conducted using single-nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) associated with serum magnesium as instrumental variables.To select SNPs, we used publicly available summary-level data from Genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We used inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger regression approaches in this analysis.The IVW method was used in the primary analysis to obtain the causal estimates.

Results: Genetically predicted serum magnesium was inversely associated with the risk of asthma.The odds ratios in genetically predicted serum magnesium concentrations was 0.229 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 0.065-0.806; p=0.022),which was further confirmed by multiple sensitivity analyses. Other diseases such as pulmonary embolism, lobar pneumonia, COVID-19, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis and interstitial lung disease did not yield statistically significant results.

Conclusions: High genetically predicted serum magnesium was causally associated with a decreased risk of asthma and suggested that serum magnesium concentrations may be crucial to prevent the onset of asthma.

#### Magnesium for treatment of asthma in children - Sept 2009

Canadian Family Physician September 2009; 55 (9) 887-889;

Marcela Davalos Bichara and Ran D. Goldman

QUESTION Magnesium is considered adjuvant therapy for moderate to severe asthma exacerbations in adults, but can it be used to treat children?

ANSWER Magnesium seems to be beneficial in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in children. It is a safe drug to administer, but there have been minor side effects reported, such as epigastric or facial warmth, flushing, pain and numbness at the infusion site, dry mouth, malaise, and hypotension. Owing to its bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory effects, magnesium is an encouraging adjuvant therapy for pediatric patients who do not respond to conventional treatment in acute severe exacerbations. Future studies should focus on establishing the optimal dosage for maximal benefits and the best route of administration. Magnesium should also be considered as a prophylactic treatment.

. Kirkuk Journal of Medical Sciences, 2023; 11(2): 51-63. [FREE PDF](https://10.32894/kjms.2022.137484.1049)

Yousif Muhammad Hassan1, Muhammed W. AL Obiady 2

* Background: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases globally and has been increasing in prevalence over the last few decades. The aim of this study is to assess the serum Magnesium levels in bronchial asthma patients in relation to severity stage.

* Methods: A case control study conducted at Baghdad Teaching Hospital at Baghdad Medical City complex of fifty patients were diagnosed as bronchial asthma according to GINA guideline and fifty healthy individuals as a control group.

* Result: Serum Magnesium levels were lower in asthmatic patients (36%), compared with healthy controls (4%), and significantly lower in asthmatic patients during exacerbation compared with stable asthmatics.

* Conclusions: Serum Magnesium levels have a positive correlation with the level of symptom control in asthma. In uncontrolled asthma, serum Magnesium is significantly low. Hence, it might be useful as a biomarker in assessing control or severity of asthma.

#### Has there been any use of vitamin D and Magnesium to treat asthma? â€“ asked [Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/has-there-been-any-use-of-vita-.m5lugiwQUCmefHbS93sVg)

Vitamin D and magnesium have shown promising potential in asthma management through several mechanisms and clinical studies.

 **Vitamin D's Role** 

 **Mechanisms of Action** 

Vitamin D helps manage asthma by reducing airway inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory cytokines, and decreasing airway smooth muscle proliferation &nbsp;[1](https://journals.lww.com/ecdt/fulltext/2019/68040/serum_levels_of_vitamin_d,_magnesium,_and_calcium.12.aspx)

It can also attenuate viral-induced asthma attacks by reducing rhinovirus replication and promoting antiviral pathways &nbsp;[6](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2769724)

. **Clinical Evidence** 

Vitamin D supplementation has shown a 30% reduction in asthma exacerbations in patients with mild to moderate asthma and low vitamin D levels &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10425698/)

This is particularly significant in patients with baseline vitamin D levels below 25 nmol/L &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10425698/)

 **Magnesium's Role** 

 **Mechanisms of Action** 

Magnesium functions by:

* Inhibiting smooth muscle contraction

* Reducing acetylcholine release from nerve endings

* Decreasing histamine secretion from mast cells

* Supporting respiratory muscle function &nbsp;[1](https://journals.lww.com/ecdt/fulltext/2019/68040/serum_levels_of_vitamin_d,_magnesium,_and_calcium.12.aspx)

 **Clinical Findings** 

Low magnesium levels are significantly associated with increased asthma severity and poor disease control &nbsp;[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5080508/)

Studies have shown that serum magnesium levels progressively decrease as asthma severity increases &nbsp;[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5080508/)

 **Combined Effects** 

The relationship between these nutrients is significant, as serum magnesium levels affect circulating vitamin D concentrations &nbsp;[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5080508/)

Both vitamin D and magnesium deficiencies are highly prevalent in asthmatic patients, and their low levels correlate with:

* More frequent asthma attacks

* Increased respiratory infections

* Severe exacerbations

* Limited response to bronchodilators &nbsp;[7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2016/1643717)

 **Treatment Implications** 

While evidence supports the role of these nutrients in asthma management, supplementation should be considered in the context of deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation represents a low-cost, low-risk approach to treating and controlling asthma when deficiency is present &nbsp; [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10425698/)

#### What are the recommended doses of Vitamin D and Magnesium for asthma patients  â€“ asked [Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/has-there-been-any-use-of-vita-.m5lugiwQUCmefHbS93sVg)

 **Vitamin D Dosing** 

 **For Adults** 

* 400-4,000 IU per day has shown effectiveness in reducing asthma exacerbations &nbsp;[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389855/)

* Most beneficial effects are seen in vitamin D deficient patients (<25 nmol/L) &nbsp;[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8389855/)

* Treatment can reduce asthma exacerbations by approximately 30% in deficient adults &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10425698/)

 **For Children** 

* For vitamin D deficient children: 50,000 IU initial dose followed by 8,000 IU daily &nbsp;[4](https://echochildren.org/research-summaries/how-much-vitamin-d-do-children-with-asthma-and-increased-body-weight-need-to-correct-low-vitamin-d-levels/)

* The Endocrine Society recommends weekly doses of 50,000 IU vitamin D2 for deficient children &nbsp; [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10425698/)

 **Magnesium Dosing** 

 **Intravenous Administration** 

* Standard dose: 25-75 mg/kg up to 2g for bronchodilation &nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4093670/)

* Typical administration time is 20-35 minutes &nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4093670/)

* Used primarily for acute severe exacerbations &nbsp;[9](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2021/0215/p245.html)

 **Oral Supplementation** 

* Studies have used various doses:

   * 200-290 mg magnesium citrate

   * 340 mg magnesium citrate

   * 450 mg magnesium amino-chelate

   * 300 mg magnesium glycine &nbsp;[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-019-0116-z)

 **Safety Considerations** 

The risk of major toxicity from magnesium is minimal at standard doses in patients with normal renal function &nbsp;[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3269605/)

.Â For vitamin D, doses within the mentioned ranges are considered safe and represent a low-cost, low-risk approach to treating asthma when deficiency is present &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10425698/)

#### Asthma both prevented and rescued by Magnesium Chloride lozenges in some individuals â€“ 2006

 **Rescue treatment and prevention of asthma using magnesium throat lozenges: Hypothesis for a mouthâ€“lung biologically closed electric circuit** 

Medical Hypotheses Volume 67, Issue 5,Â 2006, Pages 1136-1141 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.010

George A. Eby

In the rescue treatment of acute asthma, injected and inhalant magnesium are relatively weak having demonstrated value only in severe illness, although theoretical and laboratory considerations suggest that magnesium should be strongly effective as an asthma rescue agent. 

It was hypothesized that a mouthâ€“lung biologically closed electric circuit (BCEC) exists capable of nearly instantly transporting positively charged magnesium ions from the mouth and throat into the lungs. 

One hundred milligram magnesium (magnesium chloride) 4-g throat lozenges producing 100+ mM magnesium ion concentration in saliva were tested to determine if they had beneficial effects in asthma rescue and prevention. Subjects were selected based solely on need for asthma rescue, and lozenges were used as needed. Case histories are presented showing the nearly immediate effect of magnesium chloride throat lozenges in terminating and preventing asthma attacks. Throat lozenges containing magnesium chloride produced much more rapid and stronger benefits than has been reported for inhaled and injected magnesium. An added benefit from magnesium chloride lozenge treatment of asthma was relaxation. In this first report of its kind, magnesium chloride throat lozenges appeared to provide rescue benefits in the treatment of asthma equivalent to pharmaceutical asthma drugs. Countering these benefits, strong ionic magnesium solutions greatly increase rhinovirus, herpesvirus and Candida albicans in vitro, and appear to worsen these infections in humans. Magnesium lozenges releasing concentrated magnesium ions appear contraindicated during common colds, oral herpes infections, chronic rhinosinusitis, oral and respiratory infections in general, and their use must immediately be terminated if respiratory or oral symptoms worsen. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials in people without respiratory or oral infections are needed to determine magnesium lozenge safety, and the extent by which drug treatment of asthma can be reduced.
