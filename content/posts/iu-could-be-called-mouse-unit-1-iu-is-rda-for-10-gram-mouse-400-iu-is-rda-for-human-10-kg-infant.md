#### [1 IU for 10 gram mouse](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=I%20Might%20Get%20Banned%20for%20This...%20%28vitamin%20D%20video%29%20%E2%80%93%20July%202024#:~:text=no%20-%20it%20is%20how%20much%20a%2010%20gram%20mouse%20needed))

#### A test a half a century later found that 1.5 IU per gram of mouse was actually needed

[in 2016](10.3109/07435800.2016.1141937) tested 0.05 IU/g, 0.25 IU/g, 0.5 IU/g or 1.5 IU/g of mouse body weight

Thus the earlier RDA of 1 IU for a 10 gram mouse is 15X too small

#### 400 IU for a 4 kg infant incorrectly assumes that 1 IU for 10 gram mouse is correct

infant at 1 month weighs 4,000 grams = 400 X heavier than a mouse
