OBJECTIVE: The present cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25<span>[OH]</span>D3) levels and the presence of poor sleep quality in a community-based Japanese adult population.

METHODS:

Poor sleep quality, defined as poor subjective sleep quality and/or use of sleep medications, was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was compared among 512 Japanese participants aged 35-79 years, based on serum 25(OH)D3 levels, which were determined using tandem mass spectrometry. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of poor sleep quality in each group with the highest quartile of 25(OH)D3 serving as the reference group.

RESULTS:

Poor sleep quality was reported by 33.2% of the total study population. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was higher in the first quartile group (25<span>[OH]</span>D3: 2.08-18.13 ng/mL) than in the second, third and fourth quartile groups (18.14-23.07 ng/mL, 23.08-28.32 ng/mL, and 28.33-78.83 ng/mL, respectively). The ORs for poor sleep quality were 1.86 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.20) for the first quartile group, 0.73 (0.41-1.29) for the second quartile group, and 0.73 (0.42-1.27) for the third quartile group after adjusting for age, sex, and sociodemographic, lifestyle, physical and environmental factors, while the ORs were 1.68 (0.96-2.95), 0.69 (0.39-1.24), and 0.65 (0.37-1.15) after further adjustment for overall health status and depression status.

CONCLUSIONS: The first quartile group of serum 25(OH)D3 was associated with the presence of poor sleep quality.
