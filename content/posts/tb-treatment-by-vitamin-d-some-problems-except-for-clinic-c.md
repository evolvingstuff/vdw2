#### <span style="color:#F00;">Clinic C</span> was such an outlier that it was not included in their analysis

 **Possible reasons by VitaminDWiki as to why <span style="color:#F00;">Clinic C</span> had ZERO PUR** 

* Clinic C patients also get some Vitamin D co-factors, such as Magnesium in their water

* Clinic C is outdoors (Note that TB used to be cured by sunlight)

* Older patients

* Different ethnicity

* Different daily dose size

* Included a bolus dose

* Dose was different – D3 vs D2

* Dose taken at different time of day

* A different TB treatment given at Clinic C

* Vitamin Dwas  given significantly before or after conventional TB treatment

SETTING: Glasgow, Scotland, UK.

BACKGROUND: Paradoxical reactions in tuberculosis (TB) are a notable example of our incomplete understanding of host-pathogen interactions during anti-tuberculosis treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To determine risk factors for a TB paradoxical reaction, and specifically to assess for an independent association with vitamin D use.

DESIGN:

Consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative adult patients treated for extra-pulmonary TB were identified from an Extended Surveillance of Mycobacterial Infections database. In our setting, vitamin D was variably prescribed for newly diagnosed TB patients. A previously published definition of paradoxical TB reaction was retrospectively applied to, and data on all previously described risk factors were extracted from, centralised electronic patient records. The association with vitamin D use was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.

RESULTS:

Of the 249 patients included, most had TB adenopathy; 222/249 had microbiologically and/or histologically confirmed TB. Vitamin D was prescribed for 57/249 (23%) patients; 37/249 (15%) were classified as having paradoxical reactions. Younger age, acid-fast bacilli-positive invasive samples, multiple disease sites, lower lymphocyte count and vitamin D use were found to be independent risk factors.

CONCLUSION: We speculate that vitamin D-mediated signalling of pro-inflammatory innate immune cells, along with high antigenic load, may mediate paradoxical reactions in anti-tuberculosis treatment.
