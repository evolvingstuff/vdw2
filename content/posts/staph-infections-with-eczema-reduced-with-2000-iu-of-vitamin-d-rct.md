Used 2,000 IU daily for 4 weeks

Even far better benefits expected if had used any/all of the following

1. Loading dose – Consume 350,000 IU of vitamin D in a week

1. Higher daily dose – say 4,000 IU

1. Longer dosing period – say 8 or 12 weeks

BACKGROUND:

An increase in Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization in atopic dermatitis patients resulted from the reduction of cathelicidin production in these patients. Recently, an in vivo study demonstrated that vitamin D could stimulate cathelicidin production. Oral supplements of vitamin D might be beneficial in atopic dermatitis.

OBJECTIVE:

To determine the effects of oral vitamin D supplements on clinical impact including Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization evaluation in atopic dermatitis patients.

MATERIAL AND METHOD:

Twenty-four atopic dermatitis patients were included in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. They were randomly assigned into 2 groups for oral 2,000 IUs/day of vitamin D, supplement and placebo. The lesional swab culture for S. aureus was done at week 0, 2 and 4. Clinical outcomes were assessed by SCORAD score, mexameter for erythema index and konometer for conductance were done at week 0, 2 and 4. Serum vitamin D levels were also determined at week 0 and 4.

RESULTS:

Twenty patients completed the protocol. S. aureus skin colonization, SCORAD score and erythema index were significantly reduced from baseline to week 4 for vitamin D treated group comparing with placebo (p = 0.022, 0.028 and 0.014, respectively). There was an inverse correlation between serum vitamin D levels with S. aureus skin colonization and SCORAD score (r = -1.0, p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION:

Oral vitamin D supplement could reduce skin colonization of S. aureus and demonstrated the clinical improvement of patients with atopic dermatitis.
