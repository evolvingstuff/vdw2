Squamous cell carcinoma is not one of the more dangerous skin cancers. That dubious distinction goes to melanoma, which can be deadly. When you say that the number-one way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid sun exposure, you are not correct. 

 **Here are a few facts about melanomna:** 

* •In the past four decades, sunscreen use has increased by 400%, and melanoma has increased by 400%!

* •75% of melanomas occur on areas of the body that are seldom or never exposed to sunlight

* •In the U.S., as sun exposure has decreased by about 90% since 1935, melanoma incidence has increased by 3,000%.

* •As in the US, while sun exposure in Europe has profoundly decreased, there has been a spectacular increase in melanoma.

* •Men who work outdoors have about half the risk of melanoma as men who work indoors.

* •Outdoor workers, while receiving 3-9 times the sun exposure as indoor workers, have had no increase in melanoma since before 1940, whereas melanoma incidence in indoor workers has increased steadily and exponentially.

* •The advent of sunscreens, along with their steadily increasing use, has not reduced the risk of melanoma.

* •Increasing melanoma incidence significantly correlates with decreasing personal annual sunlight doses.

* •Outdoor workers do get numerous sunburns but still have a dramatically lower risk of contracting melanoma.

* •New melanoma cases are several times higher per capita in states like Utah, Vermont and New Hampshire than in Texas, which has the lowest rates of new melanoma.

So, since melanoma increases as sun exposure decreases, should we continue to blame the sun?
