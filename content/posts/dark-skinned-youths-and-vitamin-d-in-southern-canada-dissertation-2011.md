#### Abstract

Vitamin D plays a critical role in bone metabolism and many cellular and immunological processes, and low vitamin D levels have been associated with several chronic and infectious diseases. Previous studies have reported that many otherwise healthy adults of European ancestry living in Canada have low vitamin D concentrations during the wintertime. However, individuals of non-European ancestry are at a higher risk of having low vitamin D levels. This thesis examined vitamin D status in a sample of young adults of diverse ancestry living in the Greater Toronto Area. In my research I found that: 

1) vitamin D levels (measured as 25(OH)D concentrations) are low in Canadian young adults, particularly in those of non-European ancestry; 

2) vitamin D intakes, which were estimated to be on average higher than current Health Canada recommendations of 200 International Units (IU) per day, were inadequate to maintain optimal vitamin D levels year-round; 

3) vitamin D levels undergo large seasonal changes. Winter 25(OH)D concentrations are substantially lower than those observed during the fall; 

4) vitamin D intake is an important year-round predictor of 25(OH)D concentrations, but skin pigmentation and sun exposure are also important predictors during the times when UVB is adequate for cutaneous synthesis; and 

5) vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) polymorphisms are significant predictors of 25(OH)D concentrations, but their effects vary by ancestry and season, indicating gene-environment interaction effects. 

My research shows that higher vitamin D intakes are needed to offset the seasonal drop in vitamin D levels and to ensure adequate vitamin D levels year-round for those at higher risk of insufficiency.

5.3 Conclusions

#### Clipped from conclusions

One of the major conclusions derived from my research is that higher vitamin D intakes are needed to offset the seasonal drop in vitamin D levels and to ensure adequate vitamin D levels year-round for those at higher risk of insufficiency. In this sense, my study lends support to the recent recommendations of the Canadian Cancer Society, which take into account risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency (seasonality, UVR exposure and skin pigmentation). The Canadian Cancer Society recommends an intake of 1000 IU per day during the fall and winter, or year-round for those at higher risk of having low vitamin D levels (those with darker skin, who stay indoors or always cover up) (Society, 2007). While an increase in vitamin D intake, particularly during the winter, is clearly needed, further work is required to elucidate the vitamin D intakes that are necessary to achieve and maintain optimal vitamin D levels in individuals of different ancestry.
