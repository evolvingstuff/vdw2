Received 30 December 2012; accepted 2 May 2013. published online 27 June 2013.

Background: Many chronic heart failure (CHF) patients have low vitamin D (VitD) and high  **plasma renin activity (PRA)** , which are both associated with poor prognosis. 

Vitamin D may inhibit renin transcription and lower PRA. 

We investigated whether vitamin D3 (VitD3) supplementation lowers PRA in CHF patients.

Methods and Results: We conducted a single-center, open-label, blinded end point trial in 101 stable CHF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients were randomized to 6 weeks of 2,000 IU oral VitD3 daily or control. At baseline, mean age was 64 ± 10 years, 93% male, left ventricular ejection fraction 35% ± 8%, and  **56% had VitD deficiency** . The geometric mean (95% CI) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 increased from 48 nmol/L (43-54) at baseline to 80 nmol/L (75-87) after 6 weeks in the VitD3 treatment group and decreased from 47 nmol/L (42-53) to 44 nmol/L (39-49) in the control group (P < .001). 

The primary outcome PRA decreased 

* from 6.5 ng/mL per hour (3.8-11.2) 

* to 5.2 ng/mL per hour (2.9-9.5) 

in the VitD3 treatment group and  **increased**  from 4.9 ng/mL per hour (2.9-8.5) to 7.3 ng/mL per hour (4.5-11.8)  **in the control group**  (P = .002). This was paralleled by a larger decrease in plasma renin concentration in the VitD3 treatment group compared to control (P = .020). 

No significant changes were observed in secondary outcome parameters, including N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide natriuretic peptide and fibrosis markers.

Conclusions: Most CHF patients had VitD deficiency and high PRA levels. Six weeks of supplementation with 2,000 IU VitD3 increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and decreased PRA and plasma renin concentration.
