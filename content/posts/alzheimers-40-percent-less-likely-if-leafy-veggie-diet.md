#### Two diets tied to lower Alzheimer’s pathology at autopsy

 **[MDEdge](https://www.mdedge.com/neurology/article/261795/alzheimers-cognition/two-diets-tied-lower-alzheimers-pathology-autopsy?ecd=WNL_MDIQFFF_230317_mdedge)**  actual study is behind a $39 paywall

* A novel study provides strong evidence supporting the adoption of a healthy diet to protect the aging brain. In a cohort of deceased older adults, those who had adhered to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) and Mediterranean diets for nearly a decade before death had less global Alzheimer’s disease–related pathology, primarily less beta-amyloid, at autopsy.
