Cutaneous cholecalciferol synthesis has not been considered in making recommendations for vitamin D intake. Our objective was to model the effects of sun exposure, vitamin D intake, and skin reflectance (pigmentation) on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) in young adults with a wide range of skin reflectance and sun exposure. Four cohorts of participants (n = 72 total) were studied for 7–8 wk in the fall, winter, spring, and summer in Davis, CA <span>[38.5° N, 121.7° W, Elev. 49 ft (15 m)]</span>. Skin reflectance was measured using a spectrophotometer, vitamin D intake using food records, and sun exposure using polysulfone dosimeter badges. A multiple regression model (R2 = 0.55; P < 0.0001) was developed and used to predict the serum 25(OH)D concentration for participants with low <span>[median for African ancestry (AA)]</span> and high <span>[median for European ancestry (EA)]</span> skin reflectance and with low [20th percentile, ~20 min/d, ~18% body surface area (BSA) exposed](20th%20percentile,%20~20%20min/d,%20~18%%20body%20surface%20area%20(BSA)%20exposed) and high (80th percentile, ~90 min/d, ~35% BSA exposed) sun exposure, assuming an intake of 200 IU/d (5 ug/d). Predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations for AA individuals with low and high sun exposure in the winter were 24 and 42 nmol/L and in the summer were 40 and 60 nmol/L. Corresponding values for EA individuals were 35 and 60 nmol/L in the winter and in the summer were 58 and 85 nmol/L. To achieve 25(OH)D ?75 nmol/L, we estimate that EA individuals with high sun exposure need  **1300 IU/d**  vitamin D intake in the winter and  **AA individuals with low sun exposure need 2100–3100 IU/d year-round** .
