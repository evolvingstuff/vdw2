Neurosteroid and immunological actions of vitamin D may regulate depression-linked physiology. Meta-analyses investigating the effect of vitamin D on depression have been inconsistent. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of vitamin D in reducing depressive symptoms among adults in randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT). General and clinical populations, and studies of ill individuals with systemic diseases were included. Light therapy, co-supplementation (except calcium) and bipolar disorder were exclusionary. Databases Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and The Cochrane Library were searched to identify relevant articles in English published before April 2022. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) and GRADE were used to appraise studies. 

 **Forty-one RCTs**  (n = 53,235) were included. Analyses based on random-effects models were performed with the Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software. Results for main outcome (n = 53,235) revealed a positive effect of vitamin D on depressive symptoms (Hedges’ g = -0.317, 95% CI <span>[-0.405, -0.230]</span>, p < 0.001, I2 = 88.16%; GRADE: very low certainty). RoB assessment was concerning in most studies. Notwithstanding high heterogeneity, vitamin D supplementation = 2,000 IU/day appears to reduce depressive symptoms. Future research should investigate possible benefits of augmenting standard treatments with vitamin D in clinical depression.
