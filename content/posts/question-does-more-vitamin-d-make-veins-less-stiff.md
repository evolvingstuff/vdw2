## A review in [Medical News Toady Nov 2007](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/55574.php) has the following title:

# Researchers Show That Veins Stiffen As We Age.

It has the following quote "Hardening of the arteries is a good analogy for what is happening in our veins as we grow older." 

Wonder if people very low on vitamin D - elderly, MS, Crohn's, obese, chemotherapy, cystic fibrosis, liver or kidney malfunction, far from equator, etc are "difficult sticks", due to their veins being too hard?

Realize that the main problem for blood draws is finding a vein, not vein stiffness.
