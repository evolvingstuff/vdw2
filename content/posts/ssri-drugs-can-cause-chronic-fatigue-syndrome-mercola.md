 **STORY AT-A-GLANCE** 

* SSRIs, which increase serotonin levels, have been linked to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A study showed that administering  **Prozac (fluoxetine)**  to mice at high dosages induced symptoms of CFS, suggesting a link between excessive serotonin levels and the condition

* Symptom reversal was achieved with the serotonin inhibitor fenclonine

* Other serotonin inhibitors include Benadryl, the H2 blocker Pepcid (famotidine), aspirin, progesterone and GABA

* Branched-chain amino acids, tyrosine, phenylalanine and L-theanine can also help reduce serotonin levels

* GABA is a more effective solution for conditions typically treated with SSRIs, such as depression and anxiety, without the adverse effects associated with elevated serotonin

* Reducing intake of linoleic acid (LA), found in high amounts in seed oils and certain meats, is recommended if you have CFS, as excess LA impair your mitochondrial function and cellular energy production

   * Note: LAs reduces the Omage-3
