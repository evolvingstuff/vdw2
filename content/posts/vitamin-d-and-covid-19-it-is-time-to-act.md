Abstract: 

Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency is considered a global problem and might be associated with higher risk to get COVID-19 illness. In the light of COVID-19 pandemic, VitD might be a promising agent for fighting the SARS-CoV-2, since VitD is involved in various pathophysiological mechanisms that occur during COVID-19 infection. High-dose VitD supplementation, particularly for risk groups, could be recommended to achieve and maintain optimal (range 40-60 ng/ml) serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (marker of VitD status) both for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.
