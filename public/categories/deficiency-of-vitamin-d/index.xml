&lt;p>Sound clinical nutrition practice is grounded in evidence and stimulated by research. Yet, there are unanswered questions about food-health relationships. Clinical nutrition involves the identification of nutritional disorders and the motivation to rectify them with all required care. Vitamin D health exemplifies the biomedical, societal and environmental dimensions of clinical nutrition, its science and practice. It depends most of all on access to sunshine and food and probably represents a paradigm in human health which is still at its beginning. Nevertheless, the problem of its deficiency is much more widespread and common than has been thought since it was first identified as a cause of rickets and osteomalacia. &lt;strong>It is now known to spare no body organ or system&lt;/strong> . The problem in North-East Asia is comparable to much of the rest of the world, but the risk profile for it is &lt;strong>exaggerated by atmospheric pollution, cultures with sun-avoidance on account of skin colour&lt;/strong> and potentially mitigated by foodstuffs like fish, eggs, organ meats and mushrooms which can partially offset sunshine-deficiency. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and confirmation by biochemistry which may not be affordable. Therefore a close working relationship between public health and clinical nutritionist is essential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency in Middle East and North Africa</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-prevalence-risk-factors-and-impact-on-outcomes">Hypovitaminosis D in the Middle East and North Africa: Prevalence, risk factors and impact on outcomes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The main physiological function of vitamin D is maintenance of calcium homeostasis by its effect on calcium absorption, and bone health in association with parathyroid gland. Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is defined as serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels &amp;lt;20ng/ml. Vitamin D insufficiency is called when serum 25OHD levels are between 20-29ng/ml, though existence of this entity has been questioned. Do all subjects with VDD have clinical disease according to this definition? Analysis of published studies suggests that calcium absorption in inversely correlated with serum 25OHD levels and calcium intake. We hypothesize that there exist an intestinal calcistat, which controls the calcium absorption independent of PTH levels. It consists of calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) on intestinal brush border, which senses calcium in intestinal cells and vitamin D system in intestinal cells. CaSR dampens the generation of active vitamin D metabolite in intestinal cells and decrease active transcellular calcium transport. It also facilitates passive paracellular diffusion of calcium in intestine. This local adaptation adjusts the fractional calcium absorption according the body requirement. Failure of local adaptation due to decreased calcium intake, decreased supply of 25OHD, mutation in CaSR or vitamin D system decreases systemic calcium levels and systemic adaptations comes into the play. Systemic adaptations consist of rise in PTH and increase in active vitamin D metabolites. These adaptations lead to bone resorption and maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Not all subjects with varying levels of VDD manifest with secondary hyperparathyroidism and decreased in bone mineral density. We suggest that rise in PTH is first indicator of VDD is rise in PTH along with decrease in BMD depending on duration of VDD. Hence, subjects with any degree of VDD with normal PTH and BMD should not be labeled as vitamin D deficient. These subjects can be called subclinical VDD, and further studies are required to assess beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in this subset of population. This hypothesis further highlights pitfalls in treatment of hypoparathyroidism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D reduced so low that Victorian age diseases are returning</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-reduced-so-low-that-victorian-age-diseases-are-returning.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-reduced-so-low-that-victorian-age-diseases-are-returning.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="see-also-web">See also web&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency, once thought to be eradicated, is becoming a frequent occurence in children, caused mainly by dietary insufficiency. The classical manifestation is rickets, but in infants severe hypocalcaemia may present as stridor, tetany, seizures or, rarely, heart disease. Here, we describe four infants who presented with complications of severe hypocalcaemia secondary to nutritional vitamin D deficiency. (1) Female, 4 months old, several spasms. (2) Male, 8 days old, generalised tonic-clonic seizure. (3) Male, 9 months old, tetany. (4) Male, 4 months old, cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D in Japanese women: 91 percent have less than 30 ng– 2012</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-in-japanese-women-91-percent-have-less-than-30-ng-2012.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-in-japanese-women-91-percent-have-less-than-30-ng-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="mutual-interaction-between-vitamin-d-and-lifestyle-related-diseases-in-women">Mutual Interaction Between Vitamin D and Lifestyle-Related Diseases in Women&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, hypertension, cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases, as well as the risk of fractures. The major causes of vitamin D deficiency are lack of adequate vitamin D from dietary sources and avoidance of sensible sun exposure, amongst many others. Particularly, in women, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common medical problems with insidious health consequences. The control of Vitamin D is important for many women to continue working longer in good health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What causes Rickets - 1919</title><link>/posts/what-causes-rickets-1919.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/what-causes-rickets-1919.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="by-nancy-walsh-medpage-today-may-06-2013httpwwwmedpagetodaycominotherwords38808">&lt;a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/InOtherWords/38808">By Nancy Walsh, MedPage Today: May 06, 2013&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>As an essential dietary micronutrient, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in promoting calcium absorption in the intestine and maintaining a healthy skeletal system throughout life. Beyond bone health, an emerging volume of scientific studies shows that vitamin D also may provide cardiovascular, metabolic, and immunologic benefits and reduce mortality. To our knowledge, in mainland China no national surveys have been conducted to date to depict the overall vitamin D status in the population. Therefore, the purpose of this contribution was to provide the best possible evaluation of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in China by reviewing publications that measured plasma/serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) levels in various age groups and in different areas of China from &lt;strong>January 2000 to June 2012.&lt;/strong> From these investigations conducted throughout the country and from newborns to adults to the elderly, it has been found that &lt;strong>vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is prevalent in the Chinese population in almost all age groups and areas if individuals are not taking vitamin D–fortified products/supplements or are lacking sufficient sunshine exposure&lt;/strong> .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>30 percent of variation of vitamin D levels were associated with just 3 variables</title><link>/posts/30-percent-of-variation-of-vitamin-d-levels-were-associated-with-just-3-variables.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/30-percent-of-variation-of-vitamin-d-levels-were-associated-with-just-3-variables.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="determinants-of-vitamin-d-status-in-fair-skinned-women-of-childbearing-age-at-northern-latitudes">Determinants of Vitamin D Status in Fair-Skinned Women of Childbearing Age at Northern Latitudes&lt;/h2>

Since sufficient Ca2+ absorption is essential for skeletal growth, our discovery may explain findings that excessive consumption of sweeteners compromises bone integrity in children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lower vitamin D if born outside of Canada or lower education</title><link>/posts/lower-vitamin-d-if-born-outside-of-canada-or-lower-education.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/lower-vitamin-d-if-born-outside-of-canada-or-lower-education.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="association-of-vitamin-d-status-with-socio-demographic-factors-in-calgary-alberta-an-ecological-study-using-census-canada-data">Association of vitamin D status with socio-demographic factors in Calgary, Alberta: an ecological study using Census Canada data&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are a global health problem with northern countries such as Canada at particular risk. A number of sociodemographic factors have been reported to be associated with low vitamin D levels but prior studies have been limited by the ability of the researchers to gather this data directly from clinical trial participants. The purpose of this study was to use a novel methodology of inferring sociodemographic variables to evaluate the correlates of vitamin D levels in individuals dwelling in the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D level can be high, but little benefit: due to kidney, genes, low Magnesium etc.</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-level-can-be-high-but-little-benefit-due-to-kidney-genes-low-magnesium-etc.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-level-can-be-high-but-little-benefit-due-to-kidney-genes-low-magnesium-etc.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>93% of newborns of military in Hawaii had low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/93-percent-of-newborns-of-military-in-hawaii-had-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/93-percent-of-newborns-of-military-in-hawaii-had-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-at-birth-among-military-dependants-in-hawaii">Vitamin D Deficiency at Birth Among Military Dependants in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D has long been known to be essential in bone mineralization as well as calcium and phosphate regulation. An increasing body ofliterature suggests that Vitamin D is also key in many other areas to include immune function, brain development, prevention of autoimmune disease, and prevention of certain types of cancers. Studies also suggest that, with decreased sun exposure due to concern for skin cancer risk, much of the world&amp;rsquo;s population is becoming increasingly deficient in vitamin D. Our hypothesis was that vitamin D deficiency exists, and can be detected, even in sunny climates such as the state ofHawaii. To test this hypothesis, eighty-six cord blood samples were collected in the process of routine clinical testing. These samples were tested for 25-hydroxy vitamin D via liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. Percent deficiency (&amp;lt;20ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-31.9ng/mL) were determined by statistical analysis. Forty-six percent (n=37) of cord blood samples tested were deficient in vitamin D; 47 percent (n=38) of samples had insufficient 25-OH vitamin D. &lt;strong>Only 7 percent (n=6) of samples showed vitamin D concentrations at the recommended levels.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels continue to fall: Canada 6 percent drop from 2009 to 2011</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-continue-to-fall-canada-6-percent-drop-from-2009-to-2011.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-continue-to-fall-canada-6-percent-drop-from-2009-to-2011.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-society-press-releasehttpwwwprwebcomreleases20132prweb10380382htm">&lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/2/prweb10380382.htm">Vitamin D Society Press Release&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Achieving an understanding of the extent of micronutrient adequacy across Europe is a major challenge. The main objective of the present study was to collect and evaluate the prevalence of low micronutrient intakes of different European countries by comparing recent nationally representative dietary survey data from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Dietary intake information was evaluated for intakes of Ca, Cu, I, Fe, Mg, K, Se, Zn and the vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, E and folate. The mean and 5th percentile of the intake distributions were estimated for these countries, for a number of defined sex and age groups. The percentages of those with intakes below the lower reference nutrient intake and the estimated average requirement were calculated. Reference intakes were derived from the UK and Nordic Nutrition Recommendations. The impact of dietary supplement intake as well as inclusion of apparently low energy reporters on the estimates was evaluated. &lt;strong>Except for vitamin D&lt;/strong> , the present study suggests that the current intakes of vitamins from foods lead to low risk of low intakes in all age and sex groups.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D, Cod-Liver Oil, Sunlight, and Rickets: A Historical Perspective – 2003</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-cod-liver-oil-sunlight-and-rickets-a-historical-perspective-2003.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-cod-liver-oil-sunlight-and-rickets-a-historical-perspective-2003.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Pediatrics Vol. 112 No. 2 August 1, 2003 pp. e132 -e135&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rickets, a disease of vitamin D deficiency, is rarely confronted by the practicing pediatrician in the United States today. At the turn of the 20th century, rickets was rampant among the poor children living in the industrialized and polluted northern cities of the United States. With the discovery of vitamin D and the delineation of the anti-rachitic properties of cod-liver oil by the 1930s, it became possible to not only treat but also eradicate rickets in the United States. Rickets was a common disease in 17th century England. Frances Glisson’s treatise on rickets published in 1650, a glorious contribution to English medicine, described the clinical and anatomic features of rickets in great detail. The exact etiology of rickets had been elusive until the 1920s. During the Glissonian era, rickets was a mysterious disease. By the late 19th and early 20th century, faulty diet or faulty environment (poor hygiene, lack of fresh air and sunshine) or lack of exercise was implicated in its etiology. Animal experiments, appreciation of folklore advocating the benefits of cod-liver oil, and the geographical association of rickets to lack of sunshine were all relevant factors in the advancement of knowledge in the conquest of this malady. In this article, the history of rickets pertaining to the discovery of vitamin D, cod-liver oil, and sunlight is reviewed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>90 percent of Swiss men have less than 30 ng of vitamin D in the winter</title><link>/posts/90-percent-of-swiss-men-have-less-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-in-the-winter.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/90-percent-of-swiss-men-have-less-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-in-the-winter.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-levels-and-associated-factors-a-population-based-study-in-switzerland">Vitamin D levels and associated factors: a population-based study in Switzerland.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>During the past decade, major advances have been made in vitamin D research that transcend the simple concept that vitamin D is important for the prevention of rickets in children and has little physiologic relevance for adults. Inadequate vitamin D, in addition to causing rickets, prevents children from attaining their genetically programmed peak bone mass, contributes to and exacerbates osteoporosis in adults, and causes the often painful bone disease osteomalacia. Adequate vitamin D is also important for proper muscle functioning, and controversial evidence suggests it may help prevent type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and many common cancers. Vitamin D inadequacy has been reported in approximately 36% of otherwise healthy young adults and up to 57% of general medicine inpatients in the United States and in even higher percentages in Europe. Recent epidemiological data document the high prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy among elderly patients and especially among patients with osteoporosis. Factors such as low sunlight exposure, age-related decreases in cutaneous synthesis, and diets low in vitamin D contribute to the high prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy. Vitamin D production from cutaneous synthesis or intake from the few vitamin D-rich or enriched foods typically occurs only intermittently. Supplemental doses of vitamin D and sensible sun exposure could prevent deficiency in most of the general population. The purposes of this article are to examine the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy and to review the potential implications for skeletal and extraskeletal health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Insufficiency - Mayo</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-insufficiency-mayo.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-insufficiency-mayo.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Tom D.

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency, which classically manifests as bone disease (either rickets or osteomalacia), is characterized by impaired bone mineralization. More recently, the term vitamin D insufficiency has been used to describe low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D that may be associated with other disease outcomes. Reliance on a single cutoff value to define vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is problematic because of the wide individual variability of the functional effects of vitamin D and interaction with calcium intakes. In adults, vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of fractures and falls. The evidence for other purported beneficial effects of vitamin D is primarily based on observational studies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Needed 5,000 IU to achieve 30 ng of vitamin D in 3 months</title><link>/posts/needed-5000-iu-to-achieve-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-in-3-months.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/needed-5000-iu-to-achieve-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-in-3-months.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="high-dose-cholecalciferol-effectively-treats-vitamin-d-deficiencyhttpwwwmedwire-newsmd43798508bone_healthhigh-dose_cholecalciferol_effectively_treats_vitamin_d_deficiencyhtml20-medwire">&lt;a href="http://www.medwire-news.md/437/98508/Bone_Health/High-dose_cholecalciferol_effectively_treats_vitamin_D_deficiency.html%20">High-dose cholecalciferol effectively treats vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a> Medwire&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Individuals who received cholecalciferol 5000 IU/daily were much more likely than those given 2000 IU/daily to achieve the target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level, and may as a consequence have better bone and muscle outcomes, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D insufficiency is highly prevalent. Most of the studies concerning vitamin D status were generated from countries situated at temperate latitudes.

&lt;p>I have been involved in campaigning for changes to official advice on various aspects of vitamin D for the best part of a decade. Advice on exposing ourselves to the sun has, thankfully, changed: we can now sunbathe sensibly and recharge our vitamin D without being scared by threats of skin cancer. But a major anomaly in Government advice on infant feeding remains, putting a generation of children at serious risk of chronic disease and death.

&lt;p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in bone metabolism and seems to have some anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. In addition, recent epidemiologic studies have observed relationships between low vitamin D levels and multiple disease states. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality, cancer incidence and mortality, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Although it is well known that the combination of vitamin D and calcium is necessary to maintain bone density as people age, vitamin D may also be an independent risk factor for falls among the elderly. New recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics address the need for supplementation in breastfed newborns and many questions are raised regarding the role of maternal supplementation during lactation. Unfortunately, little evidence guides clinicians on when to screen for vitamin D deficiency or effective treatment options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>73 percent of Australians had too little vitamin D</title><link>/posts/73-percent-of-australians-had-too-little-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/73-percent-of-australians-had-too-little-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Problems with low UV and vitamin D in Scotland</title><link>/posts/problems-with-low-uv-and-vitamin-d-in-scotland.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/problems-with-low-uv-and-vitamin-d-in-scotland.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="figure-2-from-the-scots-paradox---below">Figure 2 from The Scots&amp;rsquo; Paradox - below&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and cardiometabolic risk factors independent of adiposity in urban schoolchildren.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>STUDY DESIGN: We assessed the relationships among serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span>, adiposity measured by body mass index (BMI) z-score (BMIz), and 6 cardiometabolic risk factors (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein &lt;span>[CRP]&lt;/span>) in a cross-sectional sample of 263 racially and ethnically diverse schoolchildren from the Boston area during late winter. Multivariate regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and BMIz examined associations of 25(OH)D and cardiometabolic risk factors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Immigrant vitamin D deficiency in Europe</title><link>/posts/immigrant-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-europe.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/immigrant-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-europe.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Low vitamin D levels even when taking 800 IU vitamin D</title><link>/posts/low-vitamin-d-levels-even-when-taking-800-iu-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/low-vitamin-d-levels-even-when-taking-800-iu-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="high-prevalence-of-hypovitaminosis-d-in-a-swiss-rheumatology-outpatient-population">High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in a Swiss rheumatology outpatient population.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is important for bone metabolism and neuromuscular function. While a routine dosage is often proposed in osteoporotic patients, it is not so evident in rheumatology outpatients where it has been shown that the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is high. The aim of the current study was to systematically evaluate the vitamin D status in our outpatient rheumatology population to define the severity of the problem according to rheumatologic diseases. During November 2009, all patients were offered[a screening test for 25-OH vitamin D levels and categorised as deficient (&amp;lt;10 µg/l [ng/ml](%20a%20screening%20test%20for%2025-OH%20vitamin%20D%20levels%20and%20categorised%20as%20deficient%20(&amp;lt;10%20µg/l%20[ng/ml) &lt;a href="25%20nmol/l">25 nmol/l&lt;/a>), insufficient (10 µg/l to 30 µg/l &lt;a href="25%20to%2075%20nmol/l">25 to 75 nmol/l&lt;/a>) or normal (&amp;gt;30 µg/l &lt;a href="75%20nmol/l">75 nmol/l&lt;/a>). A total of 272 patients were included. The mean 25-OH vitamin D level was 21 µg/l (range 1.5 to 45.9). A total of 20 patients had vitamin D deficiency, 215 patients had an insufficiency and 37 patients had normal results. In the group of patients with osteoporosis mean level of 25-OH vitamin D was 25 µg/l and 31% had normal results. In patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (N = 219), the mean level of 25-OH vitamin D was 20.5 µg/l, and only 12% had normal 25-OH vitamin D levels. In the small group of patients with degenerative disease (N = 33), the mean level of 25-OH vitamin D was 21.8 µg/l, and 21% had normal results. Insufficiency and deficiency were even seen in 38% of the patients who were taking supplements. These results confirm that hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in an outpatient population of rheumatology patients, affecting 86% of subjects. Despite oral supplementation (taken in 38% of our population), only a quarter of those on oral supplementation attained normal values of 25-OH vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>90 percent of young health care professionals had less than 30 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/90-percent-of-young-health-care-professionals-had-less-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/90-percent-of-young-health-care-professionals-had-less-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="prevalence-of-hypovitaminosis-d-and-folate-deficiency-in-healthy-young-female-austrian-students-in-a-health-care-profession">Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and folate deficiency in healthy young female Austrian students in a health care profession.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. There has been an increase in testing for vitamin D with a concomitant increase in costs. While individual factors are significantly linked to vitamin D status, prior studies have not yielded a model predictive of vitamin D status or 25(OH)D levels. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a prediction model of vitamin D could be developed using extensive demographic data and laboratory parameters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnesium Deficiency Reduces Vitamin D Effectiveness</title><link>/posts/magnesium-deficiency-reduces-vitamin-d-effectiveness.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/magnesium-deficiency-reduces-vitamin-d-effectiveness.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Most people not getting enough Vitamin D, Magnesium, and Vitamin E</title><link>/posts/most-people-not-getting-enough-vitamin-d-magnesium-and-vitamin-e.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/most-people-not-getting-enough-vitamin-d-magnesium-and-vitamin-e.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="foods-fortificants-and-supplements-where-do-americans-get-their-nutrients">Foods, Fortificants, and Supplements: Where Do Americans Get Their Nutrients?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D is cutaneously synthesized following sun exposure (vitamin D3) as well as it is derived from dietary intake (vitamin D3 and D2). Vitamin D2 and D3 are metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). This metabolite is considered the functional indicator of vitamin D stores in humans. Since Jordan latitude is 31oN, cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 should be sufficient all year round. However, many indications reveal that it is not the case. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the 25(OH)D status among Jordanians.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency and testing in Australia are epidemics</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-testing-in-australia-are-epidemics.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-testing-in-australia-are-epidemics.html</guid><description>&lt;p>~Highlights from &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/experts-at-odds-on-vitamin-d-tests-for-pregnant-women-20110802-1i9lp.html">Sidney Morning Herald Aug 2011&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D deficiency is high in winter because of reduced exposure to sunlight. It seems that in places with high humidity and a sultry climate, exposure to sunlight in summer can be low too. This study was designed to determine the vitamin D deficiency prevalence in Sari, a city with a high humidity climate at the end of summer, and compare it to winter. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on men and women aged 10 to 70. Clustered blood samples were received from 351 subjects who participated in this study toward the end of summer, and in winter. The levels of serum vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and PTH were measured. T test and X2 were used for data analysis. Results: 351subjects (66.4% women, 33.6% men) aged 11 to 69 (mean age ± SD 37.11 ± 12.6) participated in the study.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Council vs FDA concerning vitamin D deficiency in blacks and others</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-council-vs-fda-concerning-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-blacks-and-others.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-council-vs-fda-concerning-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-blacks-and-others.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="following-email-was-sent-end-of-june-2011---no-action-was-taken">Following email was sent end of June 2011 - no action was taken&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>We need your help! This summer, the Vitamin D Council is set to file a 17-page complaint against Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding their vitamin D food fortification policies and how they disparately afflict African Americans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through a combination of mandated and encouraged practices, the FDA depends upon milk to deliver virtually all supplemental dietary vitamin D to Americans. The FDA knows African Americans consume little milk, particularly relative to Caucasian Americans. The FDA, in effect, chooses to fortify a food that does not target a population who most need vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diabetes rising quickly in areas with recent air conditioning</title><link>/posts/diabetes-rising-quickly-in-areas-with-recent-air-conditioning.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/diabetes-rising-quickly-in-areas-with-recent-air-conditioning.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="reported-by-medicalxpresshttpmedicalxpresscomnews2011-06-million-adults-diabetes-reveals-scalehtml">&lt;a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-06-million-adults-diabetes-reveals-scale.html">reported by MedicalXpress&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Adams DD. From the Faculty of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following their Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the defective gene causing familial hypercholesterolaemia, Brown and Goldstein misunderstood the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of the associated arterial disease. They ascribed this to an effect of the high levels of cholesterol circulating in the blood. In reality, the accelerated arterial damage is likely to be a consequence of more brittle arterial cell walls, as biochemists know cholesterol to be a component of them which modulates their fluidity, conferring flexibility and hence resistance to damage from the ordinary hydrodynamic blood forces. In the absence of efficient receptors for LDL cholesterol, cells will be unable to use this component adequately for the manufacture of normally resilient arterial cell walls, resulting in accelerated arteriosclerosis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D less than 10 ng for groups of 45 year olds</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-less-than-10-ng-for-groups-of-45-year-olds.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-less-than-10-ng-for-groups-of-45-year-olds.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objective was to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women. Blood samples were taken from 154 African-American, 194 Hispanic, and 146 Caucasian women at &amp;lt;14 weeks of gestation; 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mean 25(OH)D levels in African-American, Hispanic, and Caucasian pregnant women were 15.5 ± 7.2 (standard deviation), 24.1 ± 8.7, 29.0 ± 8.5 ng/mL, respectively. Ninety-seven percent of African-Americans, 81% of Hispanics, and 67% of Caucasians were deficient (25(OH)D levels &amp;lt;20 ng/mL or &amp;lt;50 nmol/L) or insufficient (25(OH)D levels ? 20 ng/mL or &amp;lt;32 ng/mL or ? 50 nmol/L or &amp;lt;80 nmol/L). Of these pregnant women, 82% had vitamin D levels &amp;lt;32 ng/mL (&amp;lt;80 ng/mL). In logistic regression models, race was the most important risk factor for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. African-American women and Hispanic women were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency than Caucasian women. Furthermore, primigravid women were more at risk for vitamin D insufficiency. This study demonstrates widespread vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in pregnant females living at a southern latitude. African-Americans are at greatest risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heart Failure associated with vitamin D deficiency</title><link>/posts/heart-failure-associated-with-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/heart-failure-associated-with-vitamin-d-deficiency.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="is-vitamin-d-deficiency-associated-with-heart-failure-a-review-of-current-evidence">Is Vitamin D Deficiency Associated With Heart Failure?

&lt;p>An estimated 1 billion people worldwide have deficient or insufficient levels of vitamin D. Even more alarming is the association of vitamin D deficiency with many types of diseases, particularly heart failure (HF). Hypovitaminosis D has been observed to be highly prevalent in the HF community with rates varying from approximately &lt;strong>80% to 95%&lt;/strong> . Higher rates of deficiency have been linked to winter months, in patients with protracted decompensated HF, darker skin pigmentation, and higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypothesis – China air conditioning disease is the result of less vitamin D</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-china-air-conditioning-disease-is-the-result-of-less-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-china-air-conditioning-disease-is-the-result-of-less-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="hypothesis-people-living-in-sunny-climates-who-can-afford-air-conditioning-get-less-vitamin-d">Hypothesis: People living in sunny climates who can afford air conditioning get less vitamin D&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Mounting evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency could be linked to several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its correlates to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency was common in the US population, especially in certain minority groups. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2006 data were analyzed for vitamin D levels in adult participants (N = 4495). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ?20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). The overall prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency was 41.6%, with the highest rate seen in blacks (82.1%), followed by Hispanics (69.2%). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more common among those who had no college education, were obese, with a poor health status, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or not consuming milk daily (all P &amp;lt; .001).

&lt;p>Vitamin D is necessary to maintain healthy bones, and may prevent other chronic diseases. There is limited information regarding the vitamin D status of people living in climates with relatively high ambient ultraviolet radiation. We therefore aimed to determine serum 25(OH)D levels in a group of office-workers in subtropical Australia. We collected blood from 129 office workers in summer (n=129) and 175 in winter (91 in both seasons). Serum 25(OH)D was estimated using a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and we asked participants to complete questionnaires about sun exposure and diet for the month prior to blood collection.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>70 percent of Koreans in their twenties had less than 20ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/70-percent-of-koreans-in-their-twenties-had-less-than-20ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/70-percent-of-koreans-in-their-twenties-had-less-than-20ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-insufficiency-in-korea--a-greater-threat-to-younger-generation">Vitamin D Insufficiency in Korea&amp;ndash;A Greater Threat to Younger Generation:&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D is essential for good bone health and for most people sunlight is the most important source of vitamin D. The time required to make sufficient vitamin D varies according to a number of environmental, physical and personal factors, but is typically short and less than the amount of time needed for skin to redden and burn. Enjoying the sun safely, while taking care not to burn, can help to provide the benefits of vitamin D without unduly raising the risk of skin cancer. Vitamin D supplements and specific foods can help to maintain sufficient levels of vitamin D, particularly in people at risk of deficiency. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty around what levels qualify as “optimal” or “sufficient”, how much sunlight different people need to achieve a given level of vitamin D, whether vitamin D protects against chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, and the benefits and risks of widespread supplementation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DSM - holder of many vitamin D patents - to make deficiency map</title><link>/posts/dsm-holder-of-many-vitamin-d-patents-to-make-deficiency-map.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dsm-holder-of-many-vitamin-d-patents-to-make-deficiency-map.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="announcement-dec-15-2010">Announcement Dec 15, 2010&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>PARSIPPANY, N.J.—DSM Nutritional Products partnered with the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) to develop an interactive worldwide map on vitamin D levels to highlight the global problem of vitamin D deficiency. Both organizations agree more advocacy is needed to align the recommended vitamin D intake levels of food and health authorities the world over with more progressive, evidence-based proposals of 1,000 to 2,000 IU per day, especially for risk groups such as women and the elderly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for many diseases</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-a-risk-factor-for-many-diseases.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-a-risk-factor-for-many-diseases.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-universal-risk-factor-for-multifactorial-diseases">Vitamin d deficiency: universal risk factor for multifactorial diseases?&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In the Western world, the majority of morbidity and mortality are caused by multifactorial diseases. Some risk factors are related to more than one type of disease. These so-called universal risk factors are highly relevant to the population, as reduction of universal risk factors may reduce the prevalence of several types of multifactorial disease simultaneously. Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally seen as an etiological factor in bone disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
