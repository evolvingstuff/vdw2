#### A Literature Review of the Potential Impact of Medication on Vitamin D Status

Risk Management and Healthcare Policy 2021:14 3357-338110.2147/RMHP.S316897

Michael Wakeman	

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in media coverage of the putative actions of vitamin D as well as the possible health benefits that supplementation 	might deliver. However, the potential effect that medications may have on the vitamin D	status is rarely taken into consideration. This literature review was undertaken to assess the degree to which vitamin D status may be affected by medication. Electronic databases were searched to identify literature relating to this subject, and study characteristics and conclusions were scrutinized for evidence of potential associations. The following groups of drugs were identified in one or more studies to affect vitamin D status in some way: anti-epileptics, laxatives, metformin, loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, statins, calcium channel blockers, antagonists of vitamin K, platelet aggregation inhibitors, digoxin, potassium-sparing diuretics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H2-receptor antagonists, bile acid sequestrants, corticosteroids, antimicrobials, sulphonamides and urea derivatives, lipase inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, highly active antiretroviral agents, and certain chemotherapeutic agents. Given that the quality of the data is heterogeneous, newer, more robustly designed studies are required to better define likely interactions between vitamin D and medications. This is especially so for cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4)-metabolized medications. Nevertheless, this review suggests that providers of health care ought to be alert to the potential of vitamin D depletions induced by medications, especially in elderly people exposed to multiple-drug therapy, and to provide supplementation if required.

CNS Medications

Benzodiazepines

Whereas a lack of a significant effect of benzodiazepines on vitamin D status has been reported in three cross-sectional studies,76,80,142 Sohl et al, in a subsequent subgroup analysis of participants in their study, did observe a significant inverse association.76

Antidepressants

Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)

Theoretically, the hypochlorhydria induced by this class of medication could result in malabsorption of calcium, with the suggestion that prolonged exposure to acid suppression may be a clinically relevant consequence contributing to increased osteoporosis risk.144,145 One review suggests that it may be advisable to consider supplementation with vitamin D and calcium for the elderly, where highdose PPI therapy, especially over a long-term period, is being employed.146
