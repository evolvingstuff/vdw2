60 women with GDM in Iran – randomized half of them supplementing with

50,000 IU vitamin D twice – at day 1 and day 21

1 gram of Calcium daily for 6 weeks

##### || |Vitamin D | No D

Caesarean section rate |23 % | 63 %

Maternal hospitalization| 0 %|13 %

Infant Macrosomia   
(Large for gestational age) |0 %| 13 %

Infant hyperbilirubinaemia|30 %|57 % ||

 **Notes by VitaminDWiki** 

1. ~2400 IU daily for Iranian women (who are typically very vitamin D deficient)

1. Some of the women will probably have had high BMI

1. Vitamin D dose needed for high BMI is 2-3 more than for normal BMI ((dose did not vary with weight in this study)

1. Unsure if the Calcium is needed

OBJECTIVE:

The present study was designed to assess the effects of Ca+vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

DESIGN:

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among sixty women with GDM. Participants were divided into two groups to receive Ca+vitamin D supplements or placebo. Individuals in the Ca+vitamin D group (n 30) received 1000 mg Ca/d and two pearls containing 1250 µg (50 000 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) during the intervention (one at study baseline and another at day 21 of the intervention); those in the placebo group (n 30) received two placebos of vitamin D at the mentioned times and placebos of Ca every day for 6 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were determined.

SETTING:

A urban community setting in Arak, Iran.

SUBJECTS:

Sixty women with GDM and their newborns, living in Arak, Iran were enrolled.

RESULTS:

Women treated with Ca+vitamin D had a significant decrease in caesarean section rate (23·3 % v. 63·3 %, P=0·002) and maternal hospitalization (0 v. 13·3 %, P=0·03) compared with those receiving placebo. In addition, newborns of GDM women randomized to Ca+vitamin D had no case of macrosomia, while the prevalence of macrosomia among those randomized to placebo was 13·3 % (P=0·03). Lower rates of hyperbilirubinaemia (20·0 % v. 56·7 %, P=0·03) and hospitalization (20·0 % v. 56·7 %, P=0·03) were also seen in the supplemented group of newborns than in the placebo group.

CONCLUSIONS:

Ca+vitamin D supplementation for 6 weeks among pregnant women with GDM led to decreased caesarean section rate and maternal hospitalization, and decreased macrosomia, hyperbilirubinaemia and hospitalization in newborns.
