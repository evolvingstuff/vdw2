Purpose

This comprehensive study examines the multifaceted relationship between vitamin D and cancer, synthesizing key scientific advancements and global research trends to guide future investigations and address critical gaps in the field.

Methods

Publications on vitamin D and cancer were retrieved from Scopus up to November 2024. English-language original and review articles were analyzed using Excel, VOSviewer, and Scimago Graphica, focusing on publication trends, citation impacts, and research themes.

Results

A total of 11,442 publications (80.01% original articles, 19.98% reviews; 51.24% open access) were analyzed. The United States of America led in publications (38.3%) and citations (56.2%), followed by China (7.7%) and the United Kingdom (7.2%) in output, and the United Kingdom (10.6%) and Germany (6.4%) in citations. Countries with the highest citations per document were Belgium (103.4), Slovenia (87.9), and Puerto Rico (76.6). 

The most frequently studied cancers in relation to vitamin D were 

* breast, 

* colorectal, 

* prostate, 

* skin, 

* lung, 

* ovarian, 

* pancreatic, 

* gastric, 

* hepatocellular, 

* thyroid, 

* leukemia, 

* multiple myeloma, 

* bladder, 

* lymphoma, 

* osteosarcoma, 

* cervical, 

* endometrial, and 

* glioblastoma, respectively. 

 **Cluster analysis revealed key patterns related to vitamin D:** 

* Calcitriol’s chemopreventive role in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, 

* dietary vitamin D for its involvement in ovarian cancer, 

* vitamin D for regulation of cancer-related hypercalcemia, 

* vitamin D deficiency links to inflammation-obesity-cancer risk, 

* VDR polymorphisms affecting outcomes in lung and colorectal cancers, and

* vitamin D’s photoprotective effects on skin malignancies, and 

* vitamin D in ulcerative colitis-related cancer. 

The most cited articles emphasized optimal vitamin D levels and cancer prevention.

Conclusion

This study highlights the extensive research on vitamin D and its complex links to cancer, emphasizing future prospects with a focus on precision medicine approaches, including targeted supplementation and genomic analyses, to better address individual variability in cancer prevention and treatment.

#### Vitamin D Cancer trials often fail due to any of 5 reasons

1. Gave too small of dose

1. Gave same size dose to everyone 

> &nbsp; more is needed by obese, dark skinned, elderly, poor health, poor gut, etc.

1. Got most participants above 30 ng level of vitamin D

> &nbsp; but some Cancers, like Breast, are known to need >80 ng

1. Trial lasted only months instead of years - Cancers take many years to develop

1. Trial only measured blood levels - 6 genes restrict how much Vitamin D gets to the Cancer cells

1. Trial only used Vitamin D monotherapy

> &nbsp; often need co-factors, such as Omega-3 or [Magnesium](/posts/magnesium-and-cancer-many-studies) to boost the reponse to Vitamin D

> &nbsp; while also fighting inflammation
