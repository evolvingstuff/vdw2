BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is essential for bone health, and cutaneous synthesis is an important source. South Asians cannot attain adequate amounts of vitamin D by following general recommendations on summer sunlight exposure at northerly latitudes, and increased exposure may be appropriate for improving their vitamin D status.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the efficacy of a dose range of simulated summer sunlight exposures in raising vitamin D status in UK adults of South Asian ethnicity.

DESIGN: In a dose-response study, healthy adults of South Asian ethnicity (n = 60; 20-60 y old) received 1 of 6 ultraviolet exposures ranging from 0.65 to 3.9 standard erythema doses (SEDs), which were equivalent to  **15-90 min unshaded noontime summer sunlight at 53.5°N**  (Manchester, United Kingdom), 3 times/wk for 6 wk, while wearing casual clothes that revealed a 35% skin area. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was measured weekly, and dietary vitamin D was estimated.

RESULTS: At baseline, all completing participants (n = 51) were vitamin D insufficient [25(OH)D concentrations <20 ng/mL](25(OH)D%20concentrations%20<20%20ng/mL), and a high proportion of participants were deficient [35% of subjects had 25(OH)D concentrations <5 ng/mL, and 90% of subjects had 25(OH)D concentrations <10 ng/mL, which are concentrations at which osteomalacia and rickets occur). The 25(OH)D concentration rose significantly in all dose groups. Postcourse, all participants achieved 25(OH)D concentrations ≥5 ng/mL, whereas only 6 subjects attained 25(OH)D concentrations ≥20 ng/mL. 

Participants who received exposures ≥1.95 SEDs (equivalent to 45 min unshaded sunlight; n = 33) attained a mean (±SD) 25(OH)D concentration of 15.7 ± 5 ng/mL (mean rise: 8.7 ± 5.7 ng/mL; 95% CI: 6.8, 10.6; P < 0.001), and 94% of subjects achieved concentrations >10 ng/mL.

CONCLUSIONS: Targeted guidance on sunlight exposure could usefully enhance vitamin D status to avoid deficiency [25(OH)D concentration >10 ng/mL](35%%20of%20subjects%20had%2025(OH)D%20concentrations%20<5%20ng/mL,%20and%2090%%20of%20subjects%20had%2025(OH)D%20concentrations%20<10%20ng/mL,%20which%20are%20concentrations%20at%20which%20osteomalacia%20and%20rickets%20occur).%20The%2025(OH)D%20concentration%20rose%20significantly%20in%20all%20dose%20groups.%20Postcourse,%20all%20participants%20achieved%2025(OH)D%20concentrations%20≥5%20ng/mL,%20whereas%20only%206%20subjects%20attained%2025(OH)D%20concentrations%20≥20%20ng/mL.%20

### Summary by VitaminDWiki

* SE Asian women getting 23+ minutes summer sun per day in UK

* Casual clothes that revealed a 35% skin area

* Mean vitamin D level 16 ng (low)

* 94% were >10 ng 

### Wonder if this study accounted for the increased vitamin D due to increased skin temperature

Like most chemical reactions, more vitamin D is generated at higher temperatures

The skin is probably hotter in the sun than in the tanning bed
