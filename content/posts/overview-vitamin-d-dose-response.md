#### Need 9600 IU Vitamin D to get most people to 40 ng – with graph Feb 2011

Background: Studies indicate that intake of vitamin D in the range from 1,100 to 4,000 IU/d and a  serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D concentration <span>[25(OH)D]</span> from 60-80 ng/ml may be needed to reduce cancer risk. Few community-based studies allow estimation of the  dose-response relationship between oral intake of vitamin D and corresponding serum 25(OH)D  in  the  range  above  1,000  IU/d.  

Materials  and Methods: A descriptive study of serum 25(OH)D concentration and self-reported vitamin D intake in a  community-based cohort (n=3,667, mean age  51.3 ±13.4 y). 

Results: Serum 25(OH)D  rose  as  a  function  of  self-reported  vitamin  D supplement ingestion in a curvilinear fashion, with no intakes of 10,000 IU/d or lower producing 25(OH)D values above the lower-bound of the zone of potential  toxicity (200 ng/ml). Unsupplemented all-source input was estimated at 3,300 IU/d. 

 **The supplemental dose ensuring that 97.5% of this population achieved a serum 25(OH)D of at least 40 ng/ml was 9,600 IU/d.** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Need 14,100 IU/d to get 97.5% of the population above 50 ng/ml</span>** 

 **Conclusion: Universal intake of up to <span style="color:#00F;">40,000 IU</span> vitamin D per day is unlikely to result in vitamin D toxicity**
