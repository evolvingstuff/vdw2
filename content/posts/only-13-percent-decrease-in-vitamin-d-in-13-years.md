# Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations and Prevalence Estimates of Hypovitaminosis D in the U.S. Population Based on Assay-Adjusted Data.

J Nutr. 2012 Feb 8.

Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D from previous NHANES reports did not account for assay changes and drifts over time. 

Thus, published NHANES reports on vitamin D status for the U.S. population were likely either over- or underestimated. 

We investigated changes in vitamin D status in the U.S. using assay-adjusted serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> data from NHANES, 1988-1994 (n = 18,641) and three cycles of NHANES, 2001-2006 (n = 23,424). Changes in geometric mean serum 25(OH)D and prevalence estimates for various serum 25(OH)D cut points (<25, <30, <40, <50, and <75 nmol/L) were determined. 

From 1988-1994 to 2001-2006, geometric mean serum 25(OH)D significantly decreased by 

* 9% in all participants, 

* 12% in men, 

* 14% in blacks, 

* 16% in 12- to 15-y-old adolescents, 

* 16% in 20- to 30-y-old adults, 

* 13% in nonsupplement users, and 

* 12% in persons with BMI >80th percentile (P < 0.001). 

From 1988-1994 to 2001-2006, prevalence of serum 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L increased from 

* 5 to 10% in all participants, from 

* 3 to 8% in men, from 

* 22 to 38% in blacks, from 

* 3 to 8% in 12- to 15-y-old adolescents, from 

* 5 to 12% in 20- to 30-y-old adults, from 

* 6 to 14% in nonsupplement users, and from 

* 8 to 17% in persons with BMI >80th percentile (P < 0.001). 

Previous NHANES reports overestimated the increase in prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. 

The recent decline in vitamin D status in the U.S.  **is more likely due to increased prevalence of obesity and other lifestyle changes**  

but not to changes in milk consumption.

## So, apparently this chart, showing an approximate 50% change was WRONG, it was about 13%
