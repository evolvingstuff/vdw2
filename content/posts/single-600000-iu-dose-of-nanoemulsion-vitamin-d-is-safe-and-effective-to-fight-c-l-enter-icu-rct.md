Background: efficacy of therapeutic cholecalciferol supplementation for severe COVID-19 is sparingly studied.

Objective: effect of single high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation on sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

Methods: participants with moderate to severe COVID-19 with PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 200 were randomized to 0.6 million IU cholecalciferol oral (intervention) or placebo.

Outcomes: primary outcome was change in Day 7 SOFA score and pre-specified secondary outcomes were SOFA and 28-day all-cause mortality.

Results: in all, 90 patients (45 each group) were included for intention-to-treat analysis. 25(OH)D3 levels were 12 (10-16) and 13 (12-18) ng/ml (P = 0.06) at baseline; and 60 (55-65) ng/ml and 4 (1-7) ng/ml by Day 7 in vitamin D and placebo groups, respectively. The SOFA score on Day 7 was better in the vitamin D group <span>[3 (95% CI, 2-5) versus 5 (95% CI, 3-7), P = 0.01, intergroup difference - 2 (95% CI, -4 to -0.01); r = 0.4]</span>. A lower all-cause 28-day mortality <span>[24% compared to 44% (P = 0.046)]</span> was observed with vitamin D.

Conclusions: single high-dose oral cholecalciferol supplementation on ICU admission can improve SOFA score at Day 7 and reduce in-hospital mortality in vitamin D-deficient COVID-19. ClinicalTrials.gov id: NCT04952857 registered dated 7 July 2021. What is already known on this topic-vitamin D has immunomodulatory role. Observational and isolated intervention studies show some benefit in COVID-19. Targeted therapeutic vitamin D supplementation improve outcomes in severe COVID-19 is not studied in RCTs. What this study adds-high-dose vitamin D supplementation (0.6 Million IU) to increase 25(OH)D > 50 ng/ml is safe and reduces sequential organ failure assessment score, in-hospital mortality in moderate to severe COVID-19. How this study might affect research, practice or policy-vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D-deficient patients with severe COVID-19 is useful may be practiced.
