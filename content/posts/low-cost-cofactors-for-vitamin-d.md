### It is IMPORTANT to have cofactors when taking more than 2000 IU vitamin D average

*  **[Decrease Calcium and Increase Magnesium when increasing vitamin D](/posts/decrease-calcium-and-increase-magnesium-when-increasing-vitamin-d)** 

* There is a lack of evidence of the interactions - the following are guesses based on incomplete information

> Most studies are monotheraputic: e.g. supply Vitamin D, and rarely use any of the cofactors

### Magnesium is probably the most important cofactor

* Virtually everyone around the world has become <a href="/posts/overview-magnesium-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Magnesium and vitamin D">Magnesium deficient</a> in the past 50 years

> <a href="/posts/far-less-magnesium-available-in-the-body-now" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Far less Magnesium available in the body now">Magnesium is second</a> only to Vitamin D if the % of people who are deficient

* What appears to be an <a href="/posts/allergic-reaction-to-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2433">allergic reaction to vitamin D</a> is often due to a lack of Magnesium

* Having more Magnesium increases vitamin D bio-availability

* Magnesium comes in many forms - with a wide range of bioavailablity - Magnesium Chloride form seems to have the best bioavailability

* <a href="/posts/magnesium-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 947">Magnesium and vitamin D</a> - wide variety of information: test for Mg requires a $700 cell test

* <a href="/posts/recommended-levels-of-vitamins-and-minerals-history-rda-dri" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1017">Recommended levels of vitamins and minerals - history RDA DRI</a> how much Vitamin A, D, Calcium, Magnesium, Boron, etc.

* <a href="/posts/vitamin-d3-and-many-co-factors-in-one-pill" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2448">Vitamin D3 and many co-factors in one pill</a>

## Notes as of April 2013

* It is OK to take lots of vitamin D for a month or two (Even 50,000 IU daily for a month)

* The first cofactor to consider to take would be Mg - as <1% of people get allergic reactions to vitamin D due to being very low on Mg

* Cofactors in a nutshell: Calcium 500, Magnesium 500, Vitamin K-2 100 (or more)

* Probably the milligrams of most cofactors, as well as IU Vitamin D, should vary with the weight
