 **Curve of Vitamin D vs survive COVID - data from both winters**

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to changes in lifestyle, which could influence vitamin D status on a population level. The purpose of our study was to compare 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels in patients hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 during two waves of the pandemic (2020/21 vs. 2021/22). A total of 101 patients from the 2021/22 wave were compared with 101 sex- and age-matched subjects from the 2020/21 wave. Patients from both groups were hospitalized during the winter season from 1 December to 28 February. Men and women were analyzed together and separately. The mean 25(OH)D concentration increased from 17.8 ± 9.7 ng/mL to 25.2 ± 12.6 ng/mL between waves. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) decreased from 82% to 54%. The prevalence of adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration (>30 ng/mL) increased from 10% to 34% (p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with a history of vitamin D supplementation increased from 18% to 44% (p < 0.0001). Low serum 25(OH)D concentration was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for age and sex for the whole cohort of patients (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of inadequate vitamin D status in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Slovakia decreased significantly, probably due to a higher rate of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The prevalence of adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration (&gt;30 ng/mL) increased from 10% to 34% (p &lt; 0.0001). The proportion of patients with a history of vitamin D supplementation increased from 18% to 44% (p &lt; 0.0001).

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to changes in lifestyle, which could influence vitamin D status on a population level. The purpose of our study was to compare 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in patients hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 during two waves of the pandemic (2020/21 vs. 2021/22). A total of 101 patients from the 2021/22 wave were compared with 101 sex- and age-matched subjects from the 2020/21 wave. Patients from both groups were hospitalized during the winter season from 1 December to 28 February. Men and women were analyzed together and separately. The mean 25(OH)D concentration increased from 17.8 ± 9.7 ng/mL to 25.2 ± 12.6 ng/mL between waves. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL) decreased from 82% to 54%. The prevalence of adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration (&gt;30 ng/mL) increased from 10% to 34% (p &lt; 0.0001). The proportion of patients with a history of vitamin D supplementation increased from 18% to 44% (p &lt; 0.0001). Low serum 25(OH)D concentration was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for age and sex for the whole cohort of patients (p &lt; 0.0001). The prevalence of inadequate vitamin D status in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Slovakia decreased significantly, probably due to a higher rate of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
