Vitamin D nanosolution was used [Deksel](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/deksel-nano-60000iu-sf-syp-5ml-208299) $0.83 per 60,000 IU bottle - one of many suppliers

&nbsp; Unclear if their nanosolution was a true nanoemulsion

&nbsp; Nanoemulsion vitamin D products have been found to have perhaps 2X more response and 2X faster

Many companies selling on Amazon make Vitamin D nanoemulsions

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Nanoemulsion Vitamin D may be a substantially better form](/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-may-be-a-substantially-better-form)

87 total  participants - mild to moderate symptoms, vitamin D level < 30 ng initially

The larger comparison groups VD ( treatment grouo) and NVD ( control group) received 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Ivermectin or dexamethasone.

A subset of larger group ( eVD and eNVD) did not receive the above drugs and were measured for exclusive effect of vitamin D ( tables 4,5,6).

The slow increase in Vitamin D levels over a week allowed time for the virus to race ahead.

Suspect they would have had much better results if they had;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Give the entire 420,000 IU on the first day

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Had the participants swish the vitamin D in their mouths

Vitamin D levels measured the day after the last dose generally > 80 ng (suspect that the plateau would be 20% higher)

Additional 2 days of vitamin D if BMI >25

The study used a website to estimate # of participants needed;  **openepi.com**

#### Many clinical trials are testing Vitamin D to fight COVID-19
