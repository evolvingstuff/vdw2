 **If 2X- 3X larger doses of Vitamin D,   
>40 ng and more decrease in pain   
&nbsp; &nbsp;  100,000 to 150,000 IU per week** 

Obese women were more susceptible to myalgia because of their significantly lower vitamin D concentrations; the present study investigated the efficacy of vitamin D in addition to an aerobic interval training in the management of obese women with myalgia. Forty-five obese women with vitamin D deficiency and myalgia (30 to 40 years old) were assigned randomly into three equal groups. Group A received an aerobic interval training with vitamin D supplementation, Group B received vitamin D supplementation only, and Group C received aerobic interval training only; participants in all groups were on calorie deficient diets. The study outcomes were the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain Evaluation, serum vitamin D level, and Cooper 12-Minute Walk Test for Functional Capacity Evaluation, while the Short-Form Health Survey (SF) was used for assessment of quality of life. We detected a significant improvement in pain intensity level, serum vitamin D level, and quality of life in all groups with significant difference between Group A and groups B and C. We also detected a significant improvement in functional capacity in groups A and C, with no significant change in Group B. Aerobic interval training with vitamin D supplementation was more effective for the management of obese women with perceived myalgia.
