#### Well Being: Eggs - Dr. Malone

 **[Substack](https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/well-being-eggs?utm_campaign=email-post&r=ofo3r&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** 

* "The USDA’s (and industry standards’) definition for “Free Range” is that birds must have “outdoor access” or “access to the outdoors.”  In some cases, this can mean access only through a “pop hole,” with  **no full-body access to the outdoors**  and no minimum space requirement. Basically a hole in the wall - from which they can stick their heads out of. Sort of."

* " 5−10 times lower omega-6:omega-3 fatty acid ratio compared to the cage-free eggs"

 **Asked Bard about "pop holes"** 

A 2011 study found that approximately  **10%**  of hens in a commercially housed  **free-range flock**  used only pop holes . . .
