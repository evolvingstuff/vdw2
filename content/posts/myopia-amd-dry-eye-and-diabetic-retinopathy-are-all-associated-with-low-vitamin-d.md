The contributory roles of vitamin D in ocular and visual health have long been discussed, with numerous studies pointing to the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent findings on the association between vitamin D and different ocular diseases, including myopia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), dry eye syndrome (DES), thyroid eye disease (TED), uveitis, retinoblastoma (RB), cataract, and others, from epidemiological, clinical and basic studies, and briefly discuss vitamin D metabolism in the eye. We searched two research databases for articles examining the association between vitamin D deficiency and different ocular diseases. One hundred and sixty-two studies were found. 

There is evidence on the association between vitamin D and  **myopia, AMD, DR, and DES** . Overall, 

* 17 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and AMD, while 

* 48 out of 54 studies reported that vitamin D was associated with DR, and 

* 25 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and DES. 

However, the available evidence for the association with other ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, TED, and RB, remains limited.

The contributory roles of vitamin D in ocular and visual health have long been discussed, with numerous studies pointing to the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent findings on the association between vitamin D and different ocular diseases, including myopia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), dry eye syndrome (DES), thyroid eye disease (TED), uveitis, retinoblastoma (RB), cataract, and others, from epidemiological, clinical and basic studies, and briefly discuss vitamin D metabolism in the eye. We searched two research databases for articles examining the association between vitamin D deficiency and different ocular diseases. One hundred and sixty-two studies were found. 
There is evidence on the association between vitamin D and __myopia, AMD, DR, and DES__. Overall, 
*17 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and AMD, while 
*48 out of 54 studies reported that vitamin D was associated with DR, and 
*25 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and DES. 
However, the available evidence for the association with other ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, TED, and RB, remains limited.
