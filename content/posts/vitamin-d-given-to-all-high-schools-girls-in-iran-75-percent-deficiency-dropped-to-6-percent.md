TEHRAN — Iron and vitamin D supplements are being distributed among high school girls over the current Iranian school year (September 23, 2015-June 20, 2016), the deputy health minister said.

“Over the current school year we have distributed iron and vitamin D supplements among  **3.2 million school girls,** ” Ali-Akbar Sayyari told Fars news agency.

“Considering the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among school girls, distribution of supplements is a priority for us,” Sayyari added.

“We have also educated 500,000 students as health ambassadors nationwide,” he noted, adding, “Additionally we have initiated campaigns which call for healthy diet, getting enough exercise, and avoiding smoking.”

Sayyari stated that the cooperation between health and education ministries on health issues and raising awareness among students has well-improved for the past two years.
