#### Vitamins and minerals: A means for surviving the COVID-19 pandemic or just a myth?

J Infect Dev Ctries. 2022 May 30;16(5):782-786. [doi: 10.3855/jidc.14692.](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14692.)

A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 <span>[SARS-CoV-2]</span>) that was initially reported from Wuhan, China in December 2019, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic, where there are no specific effective preventive or therapeutic drugs available, a healthy immune system is one of the most important tools that should be considered. Vitamins and minerals supplements have been well known to help the immune system in battling viral infections in general. Physicians worldwide are largely interested in vitamin and mineral supplements to help them battle COVID-19 whether through protection or treatment. 

Dietary supplementations especially 

* vitamin D, 

* vitamin C, and 

* Zinc 

offer good prophylactic and therapeutic support to the currently available treatment regimens. They are relatively safe and were proven to aid recovery in other respiratory infections. Further studies should be encouraged especially those examining their role in prophylaxis from COVID-19 while maintaining current recommendations for social distancing and proper protective gear.
