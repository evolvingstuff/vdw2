#### Chronic Latent Magnesium Deficiency in Obesity Decreases Positive Effects of Vitamin D on Cardiometabolic Risk Indicators.

BACKGROUND:

Obesity and micronutrient deficiencies contribute to the risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

OBJECTIVE:

We examined the frequency of concomitant deficit of magnesium (Mg) and vitamin D in obese patients and evaluated the connection of these combined deficiencies with indicators of cardiometabolic risk in non-diabetic subjects.

METHOD:

Non-diabetic middle aged adults (n = 80; mean age 36 ± 4 years, 52% women) were recruited based on weight/adiposity parameters <span>[i.e. body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage (FAT%)]</span>. Cardiometabolic risk indicators <span>[insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) and CVD risk (Framingham risk score for predicting 10-year CVD)]</span>, Mg status [i.e. total serum Mg concentration (TMg), chronic latent Mg deficiency (CLMD) - 0.75-0.85 mmol/L](i.e.%20total%20serum%20Mg%20concentration%20(TMg),%20chronic%20latent%20Mg%20deficiency%20(CLMD)%20-%200.75-0.85%20mmol/L), vitamin D status [i.e. serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), vitamin D deficiency <50 nmol/l](i.e.%20serum%20concentration%20of%2025-hydroxyvitamin%20D%20(25(OH)D),%20vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20<50%20nmol/l) were assessed.

RESULTS:

Among obese subjects 36% presented a combination of vitamin D deficiency and CLMD. In all studied patients, 25(OH)D and TMg levels both, individually and combined, showed a negative linear correlation with HOMA-IR and CVD risk. In subjects with CLMD (TMg ˂0.85 mmol/L), a negative linear coefficient was found between 25(OH)D and, HOMA-IR and CVD risk, compared with subjects with normal TMg status (TMg ≥0.85 mmol/L).

CONCLUSION:

CLMD and vitamin D deficiency may commonly be present in obese non-diabetic subjects. Individually and combined, both deficiencies predispose non-diabetic patients to increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Maintaining normal Mg status may improve the beneficial effects of vitamin D on cardiometabolic risk indicators.
