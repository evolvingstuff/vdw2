 **systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials** 

* A 6-week study published in 2011 found no effect of daily supplementation with 5000 IU cholecalciferol on ratings of depression in a group of young healthy adults.

* An 8-week study published in 2013 found that daily supplemention with 1500 IU vitamin D3 plus 20 mg fluoxetine was superior to fluoxetine alone in controlling depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

* A 3-month study found that two single intramuscular injections of 150,000 or 300,000 IU vitamin D improved depression ratings in depressed adults with vitamin D deficiency.

* An 8-week study found that weekly supplementation with 50,000 IU oral vitamin D improved depression scores in patients with MDD.

* A 52-week study found that weekly supplementation with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 did not significantly lower depressive symptoms in depressed dialysis patients.
