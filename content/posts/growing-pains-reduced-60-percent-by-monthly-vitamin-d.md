Initial growing pain level  **7.5** 

Vitamin D supplementation for 3 months

Vitamin D levels increased to 34 ng (an OK level)

Growing pain level dropped to  **2.7**  

 **From PDF** 

"Growing pains are the most common form of episodic childhood musculoskeletal pain, concerning both males and females"

[Vitamin D Council read the PDF](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/new-study-finds-vitamin-d-supplementation-may-help-reduce-growing-pains/)  behind a $5/month paywall

 **Children who were deficient (10-20ng) were given 100,000 IU orally monthly for 3 months** 

 **Children who were deficient (20-30ng) were given 25,000 IU orally once a month for 3 months** 

 **Personal note** 

I often had growing pains in my legs as a child living in [cloudy Seattle](/posts/us-cities-with-least-amount-of-sunshine-top-15-all-in-washington).

Most likely I was vitamin D deficient.

Also, my mom smoked - and [smoke is known to decrease vitamin D](/posts/smoking-reduces-vitamin-d-many-studies)

A hint that I was vitamin D deficient - I got a sunburn virtually every year.

I also had two other conditions associated with Growing Pains: (comorbid)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [restless legs](/posts/restless-legs-syndrome-vitamin-d-iron-etc-many-studies) and charlie horse leg cramps

I still had [sore tibia and sternum](/posts/quick-free-self-test-for-vitamin-d-deficiency) untill a few years ago when I increased by vitamin D levels

The aim of our study was to analyze the possible relationship between growing pains, vitamin D levels, and bone mineral status. We enrolled 33 children affected by growing pains. Their pain intensity was evaluated through a questionnaire using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale for pain assessment. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase levels were measured as well. A quantitative ultrasound assessment (QUS) was also done, measuring both the amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SOS) and the bone transmission time (BTT), correlating, respectively, with bone density and with cortical thickness. After 3 and 24 months of vitamin D supplementation, we re-evaluated pain intensity and laboratory results. After 24 months we re-assessed QUS parameters. At the beginning of the study the children reported a mean growing pain intensity of 7.5 ± 1.6 SD. The mean values of 25-OH-D and PTH levels were 15.7 ± 6.9 ng/ml and 57.3 ± 27.3 pg/ml, respectively. The AD-SOS Z score was -0.53 ± 1.19 SD, and the mean value of the BTT Z score was -0.72 ± 0.96 SD. After the first 3 months of vitamin D supplementation we observed an increase in 25-OH-D levels (34.1 ± 17.8, p < 0.001) and a reduction in both PTH levels (47.3 ± 30.6, p = 0.135) and pain intensity (2.7 ± 2.2, p < 0.001). After 24 months we observed a further significant reduction in the pain intensity (3.9 ± 3.4, p < 0.001) and in PTH levels (43.7 ± 28.5, p = 0.004) and an improvement in the QUS parameters, in particular in BTT Z scores (p = 0.014). Our study suggests an interesting relationship between growing pains, vitamin D levels and bone mineral status.
