#### Oral vitamin D helps cystic fibrosis - meta-analysis Jan 2024

 **Vitamin D deficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition [https://doi.org/10.1186/s41043-024-00499-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41043-024-00499-2)

 **WMD = Weighted Mean Difference** 

Aim

Vitamin D is a prominent modulator of immunity and respiratory function. It plays a vital role in respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). S. However, there is a dearth of information on patients with CF. The purpose of the meta-analysis is to highlight the importance of following the existing guidelines regarding maintenance of Vitamin D serum levels in patients with CF.

Methods

The systematic search was conducted without utilizing any time or language limitations in original database from the beginning until March 2022. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was determined by I2 statistics and Cochrane Q test.

Results

Pooled analysis using the random-effects model of the 8 case–control studies with 13 effect sizes revealed that the serum 25-OH-vitamin D in participants with cystic fibrosis was significantly lower than controls in pediatrics and adolescences (WMD: − 3.41 ng/ml, 95% CI − 5.02, − 1.80, p =  < 0.001) and adults (WMD: − 2.60 ng/ml, 95% CI − 4.32, − 0.89, p = 0.003). Based on data from 12 studies (21 effect sizes) with a total of 1622 participants, the prevalence of vitamin D levels of 20–30 ng/ml in CF patients was 36% among pediatrics/adolescents and 63% among adults. In addition, 27% of pediatric/adolescent CF patients and 35% of adult CF patients had vitamin D levels of below 20 ng/ml.

Conclusions

As a result, according to the existing guidelines, our results proved the need to pay attention to the level of vitamin D in these patients.

* Cystic fibrosis (CF), also known as mucoviscidosis, is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestine.<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup> Long-term issues include difficulty breathing and coughing up sputum as a result of frequent lung infections. 

* Other symptoms include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the finger and toes, and infertility in males among others.

* Different people may have different degrees of symptoms.

* Congenitally unable to process Vitamin K very well - wonder if vitamin K injections would help

* "While infants born with it 70 years ago would have been unlikely to live beyond their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood"

* "Many people with CF are on one or more antibiotics at all times, . . . "

#### Role of vitamin D on gut microbiota in cystic fibrosis - 2018

Journal of Steroid Biochemistry – Jan 2018 Pages 82-87

Mansi Kanhere, Benoit Chassaing, Andrew T. Gewirtz, Vin Tangpricha

 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the gut epithelium.

* The mechanism underlying this association involves the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and inhibition of inflammation-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by vitamin D.

* Intestinal dysbiosis is prevalent in CF owing to multiple factors including malabsorption of nutrients and recurrent antibiotics.

* VDR regulates the composition and functions of the gut microbiota and decreased expression of intestinal epithelial VDR disrupts microbial homeostasis.

* Vitamin D could be a potential treatment option for altering dysbiosis in CF, but additional trials are needed to evaluate this.
