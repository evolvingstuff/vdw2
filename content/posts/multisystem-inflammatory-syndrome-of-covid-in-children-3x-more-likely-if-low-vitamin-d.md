#### Can Serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D Levels Predict the Severity of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and COVID-19?

J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol . 2023 Feb 16. [doi: 10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2023.2022-10-1](https://doi.org/10.4274/jcrpe.galenos.2023.2022-10-1)

Objective: To determine the clinical significance of serum 25 hydroxy (OH) vitamin D levels in pediatric patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) and compare the vitamin D levels of these patients with those patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls.

Methods: This study was designed for pediatric patients who were aged 1 month to 18 years between July 14 and December 25, 2021. Fifty-one patients with MIS-C, 57 who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and 60 controls were enrolled in the study. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as a serum 25 OH vitamin D level of less than 20 ng/mL.

Results: The median serum 25 (OH) vitamin D was 14.6 ng/mL in patients with MIS-C, 16 ng/mL in patients with COVID-19, and 21.1 ng/mL in the control group (p<0.001). Vitamin D insufficiency was present in 74.5% (n=38) of patients with MIS-C, 66.7% (n=38) of patients with COVID-19, and 41.7% (n=25) of the controls (p=0.001). The percentage of four or more affected organ systems was 39.2% in patients with MIS-C. The correlation between the number of affected organ systems and serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels was evaluated in patients with MIS-C and there was a moderate negative correlation (r= -0.310; p=0.027). A weak negative correlation was found between the severity of COVID-19 and serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (r= -0.320, p=0.015).

Conclusion: It was found that vitamin D levels were insufficient in both groups and correlated with the number of affected organ systems of MIS-C and the severity of COVID-19.
