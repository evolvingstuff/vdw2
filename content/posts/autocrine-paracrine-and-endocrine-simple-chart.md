#### Note: it appears that the majority of Vitamin D activation is done locally, not via the endocrine system (Liver and Kidneys)

* [Fully-activated Vitamin D (Calcitriol) is produced inside and outside of the kidneys – July 2020](/posts/fully-activated-vitamin-d-calcitriol-is-produced-inside-and-outside-of-the-kidneys)

* [Brain cells can probably activate Vitamin D without liver or kidney (at least in rats) – Sept 2017](/posts/brain-cells-can-probably-activate-vitamin-d-without-liver-or-kidney-at-least-in-rats)
