### GMO and Gluten Sensitivity -2013

[http://www.responsibletechnology.org/gluten](http://www.responsibletechnology.org/gluten)

 **Can Genetically-Engineered Foods Explain the Exploding Gluten Sensitivity?** 

“ While there is insufficient research to prove that GMO consumption causes gluten sensitivity, the evidence does show how it might, at least, exacerbate the symptoms, or contribute to the conditions that might lead to the development of sensitivity to gluten. Instead of waiting

for more research, many clinicians are now prescribing non-GMO diets to their gluten-sensitive and -intolerant patients, as well as those with a variety of other disorders.”
