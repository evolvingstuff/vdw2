INTRODUCTION:

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic, inflammatory airway disease associated with osteoporosis. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and impaired bone quality were shown to cause increased bone fragility and fractures in COPD patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate vitamin D levels and BMDs in Group A COPD patients.

METHODS:

This case-control study involved 33 males aged 50 or above diagnosed with Group A COPD and 44 age-matched healthy males. Participants' serum vitamin D and other indicators were evaluated as well as lumbar and hip BMD of COPD patients.

RESULTS:

Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in COPD patients (15.13 ± 6.02 ng/L) than controls (21.89 ± 4.49 ng/L). Two patients had a history of thoracic vertebral fracture. Lumbar (L1-L4) T scores were normal in 16 patients (48.5%) and indicated osteopenia in 15 (45.5%) and osteoporosis in 2 (6%). Hip femur total T scores were normal in 19 patients (57.6%) and indicated osteopenia in 14 (42.4%).

CONCLUSION:

Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is prevalent in COPD patients, and BMD decreases in the early period of the disease. Vitamin D and BMD should be evaluated in the early stages to prevent osteoporosis and its complications in COPD patients.
