My opinion - which is based on reading >20,000 related studies

I would love to see attempts at quantifying this

#### "A 2013 report on the state of US health identified dietary factors as the single most significant risk factor for disability and premature death"

#### Cost effective for US Medicare/Medicaid to give a 30% discount on healthy food - March 2019

 **[“Prescribing” fruits and veggies would save $100 billion in medical costs](https://www.fastcompany.com/90323580/prescribing-fruits-and-veggies-would-save-100-billion-in-medical-costs?partner=feedburner&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=feedburner+fastcompany&utm_content=feedburner) Fast Company** 

* Cost effectivity results from the simulation of healthy foods decreasing direct medical cost due to just heart and diabetes problems

   * They would have found far bigger savings if they laos considered the reduction in many other health problems

* They note that

   * 86% of health care costs are due to lifestyle diseases

   * 76% of physician visits result in a drug prescription

* They apparently assumed a 30% decrease in cost of healthy food ==> 37% increase in healthy food purchase

   * A previous meta-analysis found that 1% decrease in the price of healthy food ==>1.24% increase in purchase

* They assumed 20% additional cost for administrating the program

* Calculated just the direct medical cost reductions and ignored other cost savings - such as time on job

* Apparently assumed that Medicare/Medicaid increasing health foods late in life will result in improved health

   * VitaminDWiki is unsure if that assumption is correct

#### Yet again, review of poor nutrition education for doctors - JAMA March 2019

 **Nutrition Education in Medical School, Residency Training, and Practice** 

* "Beginning with medical school, the time devoted to nutrition is limited, with an average of 19 total hours..."

* "Similarly, requirements for nutrition education are lacking in specialty training programs. For example, the current Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Program Requirement document for internal medicine residency has 42 pages, and the document for cardiovascular disease fellowship has 41 pages, but **neither document includes the words “nutrition” or “diet** .”

* "In a 2017 survey of 646 cardiologists, 90% reported that they had not received adequate nutrition education to counsel their patients, even though 95% believed it was their personal responsibility to do so"

* "Is it appropriate to serve pizza and soft drinks at a resident conference while bemoaning the high prevalence of obesity and encouraging patients to eat healthier? A similarly poor example exists in medical conferences, including national meetings, where some morning sessions are accompanied by foods such as donuts and sausage"

#### Ultraprocessed foods - an excellent article describing a book - July 2023

 **[The Perils of Highly Processed Food](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/ultra-processed-people-chris-van-tulleken-book-review?utm_medium=email&utm_source=pocket_hits&utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-RECS-2023_08_01&sponsored=0&position=1&category=fascinating_stories&scheduled_corpus_item_id=4d9eeec8-be80-4528-af49-df60fd51f788&url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/31/ultra-processed-people-chris-van-tulleken-book-review)** 

* "In the new book “Ultra-Processed People” (Norton), the British doctor and medical journalist Chris van Tulleken bravely turns himself into a" guinea pig to explore the ins and outs of ultra-processed food (U.P.F.)—basically, food made up of substances that you would never find at home. 

* ...."he reports of his U.P.F. diet. “But at the same time, I was no longer enjoying it. Meals took on a uniformity: everything seemed similar, regardless of whether it was sweet or savoury. I was never hungry. But I was also never satisfied.” He gained weight, and so did his family: “It was impossible to stop the kids from eating my Coco Pops, slices of pizza, oven chips, lasagne, chocolate.” Sacrificing his health for science’s sake, he drinks a can of Diet Coke every morning for breakfast “and gradually began craving Diet Coke with every meal and between meals.” 

* ..."we seek out the now hard-to-find, tart, low-sugar heirloom Winesap, and regard the Honeycrisp as a sensory lie of another kind, a poisoned apple. "

* "Technical names can make the familiar seem alien. We’d be put off if something were described as a concoction of luteolin, hydroxytyrosol, apigenin, oleic acid, and oleocanthal—but they’re all natural components of your extra-virgin olive oil."
