Context: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency occur frequently in youth with HIV infection, particularly among those receiving the antiretroviral drug efavirenz. Optimal vitamin D dosing for treatment is unclear.

Objective: Our objective was to evaluate safety and measure change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentration from baseline to study wk 4 and 12 during treatment with vitamin D3, 50,000 IU monthly.

Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of HIV-infected youth ages 18–24 yr, with viral load below 5000 copies/ml, on stable antiretroviral therapy.

Intervention: Intervention included vitamin D3, 50,000 IU (n = 102), or matching placebo (n = 101) administered in three directly observed oral doses at monthly intervals.

Results: At baseline, mean (SD) age was 20.9 (2.0) yr; 37% were female and 52% African-American, and 54% were vitamin D deficient/insufficient (25-OHD < 20 ng/ml), with no randomized group differences. Of evaluable participants vitamin D deficient/insufficient at baseline who were administered vitamin D, 43 of 46 (93%) had sufficient 25-OHD by wk 12. Vitamin D supplementation increased 25-OHD serum concentration from a baseline of 21.9 (13.3) to 35.9 (19.1) ng/ml at wk 12 (P < 0.001) with no change for placebo. Although use of the antiretroviral efavirenz was associated with lower baseline 25-OHD concentration, efavirenz did not diminish the response to vitamin D supplementation. There was no treatment-related toxicity.

Conclusions: Supplementation with vitamin D3 50,000 IU monthly for three doses was safe. Increases in 25-OHD occurred in treated participants regardless of antiretroviral regimen.

## Summary of RCT by VitaminDWiki

* 46% were > 20 ng/ml initially

* 94% were > 20 ng/ml at 3 months

## Note

* Since there is no indication otherwise, we assume that the vitamin D measurements were taken on the same day as the 3rd dose. 

* We will guess that by 2 weeks after the final dose that 94% ==> 96%.

* No mention about season.  Did it happen that the 3rd month was during the summer/fall when the vitamin D levels will be higher?
