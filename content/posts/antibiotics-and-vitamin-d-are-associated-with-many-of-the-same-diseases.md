### Misc. notes from the book Missing Microbes

* 100  **Million**  neurons in gut (vs 100  **Billion**  neurons in adult brain)

* Author is very concerned about increased antibiotics ==> increased disease

* Author is extremely concerned about antibiotic resistance ==> world-wide pandemic - far worse than any in the past 500 years

* 17 antibiotic courses by age 20 in the US now (varies a lot with which state you live in - see map below)

* Antibiotics in US children < age 2: 1365 / 1000 (average of more than 1 per child)

* Sweden  banned antibiotics for farm animal weight gain in 1986

* US continues to give antibiotics to new-born infant eyes - vs Sweden does not, and has no eye infection anyway

*  **C-Section**  4% in Sweden, 30% in US (go to 50% by 2020), and 80% in Rome

* Esophageal Cancer increased 6X in 30 years (see chart on this page) - while H.pylori decreased

* Currently only 6% of US children have H.pylori

* GERD (Heart Burn) currently 10-20% of US - author believes it it due to reduction in H.pylori 

* Study found 8X more GERD if no H.pylori 

* GERD has suspected 2-way-link with Asthma

*  **Modern plagues** : obesity, T1 diabetes, asthma, hay fever, food allergies, esphageal reflux and cancer, celiac disease, chron’s disease, ulcerative colitits, autism, ecezma, MRAS,  C-diff; also increase in C-sections

* There are perhaps  **10,000 species of bacteria in the adult human colon.** 

> There appear to be no bacteria in fetus before birth.

* Author is against using antibiotics for runny nose and ear infections. 80% of upper RTI are virus – which are not treated with antibiotics

*  **BRCA**  breast cancer developes earlier in women born after 1940 (had antibiotics)

*  **C.diff**  infections (antibiotic resistant) now account for 250,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths

> C.diff  **<span style="color:#F00;">cure rate with fecal transfer 94 %</span>** , standard drug cure rate is only 31%

> And it's not far fetched to think that ( **fecal transfer** ) also could be used to treat  **obesity**  and a variety of immunoloic disorders, possibly including  **autism** 

*  **MRSA**  infections (antibiotic resistant) now affect 2,000,000 US per year for 250,000 hospitalizations and 23,000 deaths

* Author is concerned that many "contingency" organisms are totally wiped out by antibiotics - probiotics does NOT replace them  ANTIBIOTIC WINTER

> 15-40% of microbial diversity is lost in otherwise normal individuals (for more loss of diversity in those who are obese, . . )

* 70% of kids with upper respiratory infection get an antibiotic - when the problem is typically due to a virus - which is not stopped by antibiotics

* Many countries have been trying to preserve "antibiotic efficacy" for 10-20 years.  

> FDA started thinking about an optional decrease in antibiotics for animals in 2013

### Thoughts by Henry Lahore - admin of VitaminDWiki

* Are there societies which have had very little or perhaps no antibiotics?

> Have their disease rates increased?

* What % of weight gain can be explained by the antibiotic data 

* Chemotherapy leads to bacterial infection – wonder if Chemo is like antibiotic – author does not seem to say

* So, what might be increasing so many diseases all around the world?

> besides: Increased Antibiotics, and Decreased vitamin D?

> If not, what %.  Are they synergistic?

### Update Sept 2015

Blaser is heading a task force to look at alternatives.  First meeting Sept 29 2015

[The US Is Finally Taking Action on Antibiotic Resistance](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/us-finally-taking-action-antibiotic-resistance/) Wired Magazine

 **We’ll be asking questions like:** 

How do we curtail antibiotic use? 

Can we come up with alternatives to antibiotics? 

Can we have narrow spectrum antibiotics that only target harmful bacteria? 

Can we develop new diagnostics to show viral versus antibacterial infections?

### Association of caesarean delivery with child adiposity from age 6 weeks to 15 years.

Int J Obes (Lond). 2013 Jul;37(7):900-6. [doi: 10.1038/ijo.2013.49.](https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2013.49.) Epub 2013 Apr 8.

Blustein J1, Attina T, Liu M, Ryan AM, Cox LM,  **Blaser M** J, Trasande L.

OBJECTIVES: To assess associations of caesarean section with body mass from birth through adolescence.

DESIGN: Longitudinal birth cohort study, following subjects up to 15 years of age.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Children born in 1991-1992 in Avon, UK who participated in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (n=10 219).

OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: standardized measures of body mass (weight-for length z-scores at 6 weeks, 10 and 20 months; and body mass index (BMI) z-scores at 38 months, 7, 9, 11 and 15 years). Secondary outcome: categorical overweight or obese (BMI: 85th percentile) for age and gender, at 38 months, 7, 9, 11 and 15 years.

RESULTS: Of the 10 219 children, 926 (9.06%) were delivered by caesarean section. Those born by caesarean had lower-birth weights than those born vaginally (-46.1 g, 95% confidence interval(CI): 14.6-77.6 g; P=0.004). In mixed multivariable models adjusting for birth weight, gender, parental body mass, family sociodemographics, gestational factors and infant feeding patterns, caesarean delivery was consistently associated with increased adiposity, starting at 6 weeks (+0.11 s.d. units, 95% CI: 0.03-0.18; P=0.005), through age 15 (BMI z-score increment+0.10 s.d. units, 95% CI: 0.001-0.198; P=0.042). By age 11 caesarean-delivered children had 1.83 times the odds of overweight or obesity (95% CI: 1.24-2.70; P=0.002). When the sample was stratified by maternal pre-pregnancy weight, the association among children born of overweight/obese mothers was strong and long-lasting. In contrast, evidence of an association among children born of normal-weight mothers was weak.

CONCLUSION: Cesarean delivery is associated with increased body mass in childhood and adolescence. Research is needed to further characterize the association in children of normal weight women. Additional work is also needed to understand the mechanism underlying the association, which may involve relatively enduring changes in the intestinal microbiome.

### Probiotics, prebiotics, and the host microbiome: the science of translation.

Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2013 Dec;1306:1-17. [doi: 10.1111/nyas.12303.](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12303.) Epub 2013 Nov 22.

Recent advances in our understanding of the community structure and function of the human microbiome have implications for the potential role of probiotics and prebiotics in promoting human health. A group of experts recently met to review the latest advances in microbiota/microbiome research and discuss the implications for development of probiotics and prebiotics, primarily as they relate to effects mediated via the intestine. The goals of the meeting were to share recent advances in research on the microbiota, microbiome, probiotics, and prebiotics, and to discuss these findings in the contexts of regulatory barriers, evolving healthcare environments, and potential effects on a variety of health topics, including the development of obesity and diabetes; the long-term consequences of exposure to antibiotics early in life to the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota; lactose intolerance; and the relationship between the GI microbiota and the central nervous system, with implications for depression, cognition, satiety, and mental health for people living in developed and developing countries. This report provides an overview of these discussions.

### Pathways in microbe-induced obesity.

Cell Metab. 2013 Jun 4;17(6):883-94. [doi: 10.1016/j.cmet.2013.05.004.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2013.05.004.)

Cox LM1,  **Blaser M** J.

Diet, host gene composition, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota can contribute to obesity. In microbe-induced obesity, metabolic changes stem from primary perturbation of the microbiota, consequent to modern changes in human biology. Microbiota disruption during early development can result in syndromes of metabolic dysfunction. We focus on the pathways involved in these interactions, particularly related to energy extraction and the role of inflammation in the metabolic phenotypes. Model physiologic systems and perturbations including gastric bypass surgery, pregnancy, and hibernation provide insight into the respective roles of the critical participants.

### A Brave New World: The Lung Microbiota in an Era of Change

Annals of the American Thoracic Society, Vol. 11, No. Supplement 1 (2014), pp. S21-S27. [doi: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201306-189MG](https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201306-189MG)

The development of culture-independent techniques has revolutionized our understanding of how our human cells interact with the even greater number of microbial inhabitants of our bodies. As part of this revolution, data are increasingly challenging the old dogma that in health, the lung mucosa is sterile. To understand how the lung microbiome may play a role in human health, we identified five major questions for lung microbiome research: 

* (1) Is the lung sterile? 

* (2) Is there a unique core microbiome in the lung? 

* (3) How dynamic are the microbial populations? 

* (4) How do pulmonary immune responses affect microbiome composition? and 

* (5) Are the lungs influenced by the intestinal immune responses to the gut microbiome? 

From birth, we are exposed to continuous microbial challenges that shape our microbiome. In our changing environment, perturbation of the gut microbiome affects both human health and disease. With widespread antibiotic use, the ancient microbes that formerly resided within us are being lost, for example, Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. Animal models show that antibiotic exposure in early life has developmental consequences. Considering the potential effects of this altered microbiome on pulmonary responses will be critical for future investigations.

### Antibiotic exposure and the development of coeliac disease: a nationwide case-control study.

BMC Gastroenterol. 2013 Jul 8;13:109. [doi: 10.1186/1471-230X-13-109.](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230X-13-109.)

Mårild K1, Ye W, Lebwohl B, Green PH,  **Blaser**  MJ, Card T, Ludvigsson JF.

BACKGROUND:

The intestinal microbiota has been proposed to play a pathogenic role in coeliac disease (CD). Although antibiotics are common environmental factors with a profound impact on intestinal microbiota, data on antibiotic use as a risk factor for subsequent CD development are scarce.

METHODS:

In this population-based case-control study we linked nationwide histopathology data on 2,933 individuals with CD (Marsh stage 3; villous atrophy) to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to examine the association between use of systemic antibiotics and subsequent CD. We also examined the association between antibiotic use in 2,118 individuals with inflammation (Marsh 1-2) and in 620 individuals with normal mucosa (Marsh 0) but positive CD serology. All individuals undergoing biopsy were matched for age and sex with 28,262 controls from the population.

RESULTS:

Antibiotic use was associated with 

* CD (Odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> = 1.40; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 1.27-1.53), 

* inflammation (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.72-2.10) and 

* normal mucosa with positive CD serology (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.30-1.92). 

ORs for prior antibiotic use in CD were similar when we excluded antibiotic use in the last year (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.08-1.56) or restricted to individuals without comorbidity (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.16 - 1.46).

CONCLUSIONS:

The positive association between antibiotic use and subsequent CD but also with lesions that may represent early CD suggests that intestinal dysbiosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of CD. However, non-causal explanations for this positive association cannot be excluded.

### More H-pylori, less stroke - Sept 2013

 **Association between Helicobacter pylori and mortality in the NHANES III study** 

Gut. 2013 Sep;62(9):1262-9. [doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303018.](https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303018.) Epub 2013 Jan 8.

Chen Y1, Segers S,  **Blaser**  MJ.

OBJECTIVE:

Persistent colonisation by Helicobacter pylori, and especially by cagA-positive strains, has been related to several health outcomes with effects in opposite directions. Thus, it is important to evaluate its influence on total and category-specific mortality.

DESIGN:

We conducted prospective cohort analyses in a nationally representative sample of 9895 participants enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III to assess the association of H pylori status with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Analyses for the association of H pylori cagA positivity with mortality were conducted in 7384 subjects with data on H pylori cagA status.

RESULTS:

In older people (> 40.1 years), H pylori was  **not associated with all-cause mortality**  (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18). 

There was an inverse association of H pylori status with  **stroke mortality**  (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.08), and the inverse association was stronger for H pylori cagA positivity, with the HR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.76). H pylori was also strongly positively related to gastric cancer mortality. After we adjusted p values using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method to account for multiple comparisons, these associations remained, and H pylori status was not related to other outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings suggest that H pylori has a mixed role in human health, but is not a major risk factor for all-cause mortality.

### Infant antibiotic exposures and early-life body mass.

Int J Obes (Lond). 2013 Jan;37(1):16-23. [doi: 10.1038/ijo.2012.132.](https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2012.132.) Epub 2012 Aug 21.

Trasande L1, Blustein J, Liu M, Corwin E, Cox LM,  **Blaser**  MJ.

OBJECTIVES:

To examine the associations of antibiotic exposures during the first 2 years of life and the development of body mass over the first 7 years of life.

DESIGN:

Longitudinal birth cohort study.

SUBJECTS:

A total of 11 532 children born at 2500 g in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population-based study of children born in Avon, UK in 1991-1992.

MEASUREMENTS:

Exposures to antibiotics during three different early-life time windows (<6 months, 6-14 months, 15-23 months), and indices of body mass at five time points (6 weeks, 10 months, 20 months, 38 months and 7 years).

RESULTS:

Antibiotic exposure during the earliest time window (<6 months) was consistently associated with increased body mass (+0.105 and +0.083 s.d. unit, increase in weight-for-length Z-scores at 10 and 20 months, P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively; body mass index (BMI) Z-score at 38 months +0.067 s.d. units, P=0.009; overweight OR 1.22 at 38 months, P=0.029) in multivariable, mixed-effect models controlling for known social and behavioral obesity risk factors. Exposure from 6 to 14 months showed no association with body mass, while exposure from 15 to 23 months was significantly associated with increased BMI Z-score at 7 years (+0.049 s.d. units, P=0.050). Exposures to non-antibiotic medications were not associated with body mass.

CONCLUSIONS:

Exposure to antibiotics during the first 6 months of life is associated with consistent increases in body mass from 10 to 38 months. Exposures later in infancy (6-14 months, 15-23 months) are not consistently associated with increased body mass. Although effects of early exposures are modest at the individual level, they could have substantial consequences for population health. Given the prevalence of antibiotic exposures in infants, and in light of the growing concerns about childhood obesity, further studies are needed to isolate effects and define life-course implications for body mass and cardiovascular risks.

### US Recommendations on antibiotics fails to recommend reduction of farm antibiotics - Sept 2014

Their Report told of the problem on antibiotics on the farm, but the recommendations made little mention of it.

One of the 14 member of the task force was Dennis Treacy, executive  **vice president of meat-production**  giant Smithfield Foods.

Perhaps Dennis had something to do with the omission in the recommendations.

### Since 2000 Antibiotics in chicken feed only increases growth by only ~ 1%

[CAFOs, Your Gut, and Mental Health](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/03/25/cafos-gut-mental-health.aspx?e_cid=20150325Z1_DNL_NB_art_2&utm_source=dnl&utm_medium=email&utm_content=art2&utm_campaign=20150325Z1_DNL_NB&et_cid=DM70493&et_rid=889308562) Mercola March 2015

“The growth response to antibiotics may have decreased over the past 30 years for several possible reasons. 

* First, the growth response to antibiotics is less important when animal nutrition, hygiene, genetics, and health are optimal. The relative improvement in the growth rate resulting from supplementing the diet of pigs with antibiotics has been shown to be inversely related to the growth rate of animals not being fed antibiotics. With changes in the livestock industry over the past 30 years, all of these factors have improved. 

* Second, increasing levels of resistance in animals could be diminishing the overall effectiveness of AGPs, although data are lacking to evaluate this hypothesis.”

 **Organic Lables include** 

*  **100% USDA Organic**  label offers excellent assurance that antibiotics have not been used at any stage of production.

*  **"No antibiotics administered"**  and similar labels also offer high assurance that antibiotics have not been used, especially if accompanied by a "USDA process Verified" shield.

*  **"Grass-fed"**  label coupled with USDA Organic label means no antibiotics have been used, but if the "grass-fed" label appears alone, antibiotics may have been given.

*  **"American Grass-fed"**  and " **Food Alliance Grass-fed"**  labels indicate that in addition to having been raised on grass, the animal in question received no antibiotics.
