#### The Association Between Vitamin D Level and Chest Pain, Anxiety, and Fatigue in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease

This study sought to assess the association between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and chest pain, anxiety, and fatigue in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from a sample of 90 participants with CAD. Serum 25OHD3 was measured using a radioimmunoassay procedure. Chest pain was assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, anxiety using the Anxiety Subscale, and fatigue by the General Fatigue subscale. The majority of participants (80%) had VDD. 

Results showed that the level of vitamin D was significantly negatively associated with

* chest pain (r = -.43, p = .00);

* anxiety (r = -.466, p = .00); and 

* fatigue (r = -.25, p = .018). 

Findings suggest the role of VDD in heightened central sensitivity in cardiac-related symptoms such as chest pain, anxiety, and fatigue. Patients with CAD should be monitored for VDD so that the condition can be corrected.
