" . . .  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a [new qualified health claim for magnesium](https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-announces-qualified-health-claim-magnesium-and-reduced-risk-high-blood-pressure) in reducing the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). In other words, the FDA is acknowledging a relationship between magnesium intake (from both foods and dietary supplements) and a reduced risk of high blood pressure."

 **FDA** 

* “Consuming diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). However, the FDA has concluded that the evidence is inconsistent and inconclusive.”

* “Some scientific evidence suggests that diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension), a condition associated with many factors. The FDA has concluded that the scientific evidence supporting this claim is inconsistent and not conclusive.”
