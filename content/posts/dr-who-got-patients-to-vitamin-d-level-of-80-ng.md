**Doctor ran a US family practice clinic with 8,000 patients, most of whom achieved 80 ng Â± 10 ng of Vitamin D** 

In priority order, after Vitamin D, he often added 

* [Magnesium](/posts/overview-magnesium-and-vitamin-d), 

* [Iodine](/posts/vitamin-d-and-iodine-are-similar-and-both-are-deficient-and-important-to-health)

* [Vitamin C](/posts/vitamin-c-is-important-for-the-common-cold-and-much-else) 

He typically used 5,000 IU vitamin D pills - and just varied the number of piils per week to get to 80 ng - which varied a lot across his patients

Most patients felt improvement in a few weeks with 10,000 IU daily (2 pills)

The addition of Magnesium was especially helpful with 

* [Asthma](/posts/overview-asthma-and-vitamin-d)

* [sickle cell](/posts/sickle-cell-and-low-vitamin-d-3-presentations)
