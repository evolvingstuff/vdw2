Oxidative stress is caused by an abundant generation of reactive oxygen species, associated to a diminished capacity of the endogenous systems of the organism to counteract them. Activation of prooxidative pathways and boosting of inflammatory cytokines are always encountered in viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. So, the importance of counteracting cytokine storm in COVID-19 pathology is highly important, to hamper the immunogenic damage of the endothelium and alveolar membranes. Antioxidants prevent oxidative processes, by impeding radical species generation. It has been proved that vitamin intake lowers oxidative stress markers, alleviates cytokine storm and has a potential role in reducing disease severity, by lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines, hampering hyperinflammation and organ failure. For the approached compounds, direct antiviral roles are also discussed in this review, as these activities encompass secretion of antiviral peptides, modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor expression and interaction with spike protein, inactivation of furin protease, or inhibition of pathogen replication by nucleic acid impairment induction. Vitamin administration results in beneficial effects. Nevertheless, timing, dosage and mutual influences of these micronutrients should be carefullly regarded.
