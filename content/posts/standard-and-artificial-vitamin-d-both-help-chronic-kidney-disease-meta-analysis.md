Background and Objectives: Recent studies have supported a role for both newer and more established vitamin D compounds in improving proteinuria, although systematic evaluation is lacking. Furthermore, concerns remain regarding the influence of vitamin D on the progression of renal function. We analyzed the efficacy and safety of vitamin D in non-dialysis patients and compared the use of newer versus established vitamin D compounds by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Design: A literature search of PubMed (1975 to September, 2012), EMBASE.com (1966 to September, 2012) and Ovid EBM Reviews (through September, 2012) was conducted.

Results: Eighteen studies were eligible for final inclusion; of these, six explored the effects of vitamin D on proteinuria, twelve studied the effects of supplementation on renal function, and fifteen discussed the incidence of hypercalcemia. Compared to the placebo or no interference,  **both the newer and established vitamin D sterols reduced proteinuria to a similar extent (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.81)** . No decrease in the glomerular filter rate was observed (SMD, −0.10; 95%CI, −0.24 to 0.03), and the risk for dialysis initiation was 1.48 (95% CI, 0.54 to 4.03) with vitamin D treatment. Additionally, there was an increased risk of hypercalcemia for patients treated with either newer or established vitamin D compounds as compared with the controls (RR, 4.78; 95% CI, 2.20 to 10.37).  **The head-to-head studies showed no differences in the effects of either newer or established compounds on proteinuria or the risk of hypercalcemia** . No serious adverse events were associated with the administration of vitamin D.

Conclusions: Vitamin D therapy appears to decrease proteinuria and have no negative influence on renal function in non-dialysis patients. 

But the occurrence of hypercalcemia should be evaluated when vitamin D is provided. 

No superiority for newer versus established vitamin D analogue is found.
