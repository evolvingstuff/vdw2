Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are heavy metals (HMs) that persistently contaminate the ecosystem, and bioaccumulation in bones is a health concern. We used biochemical and molecular assays to assess the cytoprotective effect of vitamin D (VD) on Cd- and Pd-induced chemical toxicity of human bone osteoblasts in vitro. Exposing Cd and Pb to human osteoblast cultures at concentrations of 0.1–1000 µM for 24–72 h significantly reduced osteoblast viability in an exposure time- and concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of Cd on osteoblasts was more severe than Pb’s, with 72-h exposure estimated half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 8 and 12 µM, respectively, and VD (1 and 10 nM) alleviated cytotoxicity. 

Bioenergetics assays of ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial complex I and III activity showed that both Cd and Pb (1 and 10 µM) inhibited cellular bioenergetics after 72-h exposure. Cd and Pb increased lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species with reduced catalase/superoxide dismutase antioxidant activities and increased activity of caspases -3, -8, and -9. 

Co-treatment with VD (1 and 10 nM) counteracted bioenergetic disruption, oxidative damage, and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that VD is effective in managing the toxic effects of environmental pollutants and in treating bone diseases characterized by oxidative stress, apoptosis, and bioenergetic disruption.
