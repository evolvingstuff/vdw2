# The Multiple Roles of Vitamin D in Human Health. A Mini-Review

J. Boucher, Barbara

Immunology, Endocrine & Metabolic Agents - Medicinal Chemistry (Formerly, Volume 11, Number 3, September 2011 , pp. 220-227(8)

Vitamin D is a hormone precursor, originally provided by ultraviolet light-induced skin synthesis of cholecalciferol but, with modern lifestyles, humans depend on dietary intake <span>[mainly as ergocalciferol]</span>; adequate intakes are essential for musculo-skeletal health, the `classical' benefits of this vitamin, modulated by the activated hormonal metabolite, calcitriol. Most other tissues also contain vitamin D receptors and it's activating enzyme. 

Hypovitaminosis D is associated with many disease risks and many protective mechanisms are known that explain this; in vitro and in vivo repletion or supplementation activating such mechanisms (e.g. in inflammation, atherosclerosis & malignancy). 

This review outlines knowledge on the roles of vitamin in reducing all-cause mortality and ameliorating disease (including 

* metabolic syndrome,

* insulin resistance and secretion, 

* diabetes, 

* hypertension, 

* cardiovascular disease, 

* autoimmunity, 

* arthritis, 

* multiple sclerosis, 

* periodontal disease, 

* Inflammatory bowel disease, 

* asthma and respiratory infections, 

* tuberculosis, 

* nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 

* polycystic ovary syndrome and fertility, 

* wound healing, 

* psoriasis and sepsis). 

 **Interactions of vitamin D with calcium & vitamin A**  and variation in effects with genetic polymorphisms are referred to. 

 **Reasons**  for the continuing high prevalences of vitamin D insufficiency world-wide and current difficulties in defining both vitamin D status and adequate repletion are discussed. It is suggested that whilst calcitriol analogues may have increasing roles in treatment, adequate vitamin D repletion at the population level is likely to provide a  **very cost-effective measure**  for health promotion. However, adequate randomized controlled trials are needed before larger doses than currently used are considered for long-term use at the population level.
