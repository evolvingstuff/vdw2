#### Exploring the link between VDR rs2228570 and uterine leiomyoma in Iranian women

Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics, doi:10.1016/j.ejmhg.2015.08.007

Shirin Shahbazi, 

Evidences are growing toward an inhibitory role of vitamin D3 in uterine leiomyoma pathogenesis. Uterine leiomyoma commonly affects women of reproductive age and is referred to as one of the  **most common indications for hysterectomy** , worldwide. The effects of vitamin D are mediated through the vitamin D receptor. A single nucleotide polymorphism of the VDR gene results in longer protein with decreased activity. The present study has focused on the distribution of FokI polymorphism in Iranian patients with uterine leiomyoma. Using the PCR-RFLP method 45 cases and 53 controls were assessed. The results demonstrated a correlation between VDR TT genotype and uterine leiomyoma by Odds Ratio of 1.886 (CI, .767–4.640). The examination of heterozygous CT genotype also showed the same result by Odds Ratio of 1.875 (CI, .629–5.590). 

This study lends support for an increased risk of uterine leiomyoma associated with the VDR rs2228570 polymorphism. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report regarding VDR FokI polymorphism in leiomyoma patients.
