BACKGROUND:

High rates of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency have been demonstrated in various patient populations, including patients undergoing total joint arthroplasties (TJA). However, the risk factors associated with this condition and its seasonal variation is still to be determined in patients scheduled for elective TJA.

METHODS:

We retrospectively identified 226 (116 hips, 120 knees) patients who underwent primary TJA, and had a vitamin D measurement, at a single institution (latitude, 41° 30' N) from 2006 to 2016. Demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative data were collected from electronic medical records. Patients were stratified into vitamin D sufficient (≥30 ng/mL), insufficient (<30 ng/mL), and deficient group (<20 ng/mL). Multivariate regression analyses were used to study the risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency.

RESULTS:

There were 99/226 (43.8%) patients in the vitamin D sufficient group, 137/226 patients (60.6%) in the insufficient group, of which 61/226 (26.9%) were in the deficient group. On multivariate analysis, an American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) score ≥3 was a risk factor for vitamin D insufficiency (P<0.001), while ASA ≥3 (P<0.001) and younger age (P=0.002) were risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D levels varied between the quarters with lowest level seen in quarter 1 (P=0.015).

CONCLUSIONS:

There was an overall high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (60%) and deficiency (27%). Due to higher risk of hypovitaminosis D, particular attention should be placed in patients with an ASA score ≥3, and patients scheduled during winter season.

 **Conclusion from PDF** 

Patients  scheduled  for  lower  extremity  TJA  in  a  region  of  the  United  States,  whose  latitude  is  41°  30'  N,  have  an  overall  high  prevalence  of  vitamin  D  insufficiency  (60%)  and deficiency (27%). Based on our findings, due to higher risk  of  hypovitaminosis  D,  particular  attention  should  be  placed  in  patients  with  an  ASA  score  ≥3,  and  scheduled  during  winter  season.  Further  research  is  needed  to  establish  the  definitive  prevalence  of  hypovitaminosis  D  and the potential detrimental effect it could have on patient outcomes following TJA. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis must  determine  if  universal  screening  or  treatment  should  be  included  in  TJA  preoperative  guidelines.  In  summary,  although  we  were  able  to  identify  several  risk  factors  associated with low vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, the effect of these conditions on patient outcomes following TJA  remains  to  be  determined,  as  there  is  a  paucity  of  studies  demonstrating  causal  relationship  between  low  vitamin D levels and poor patient outcomes.
