The study cohort included 11,703 participants, aged 25-49 years, who underwent neither refractive nor cataract surgery.

The right eyes (-1.76 ± 0.03 D) were more myopic than the left eyes (-1.70 ± 0.03 D; P &lt; 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high myopia was associated with age (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>, 0.97 per 1 year-increase) and female sex (OR, 1.24). Other identified risk factors included education level ≥university graduation (OR, 1.91), the presence of hypertension (OR, 1.69), and serum glucose level (OR, 1.01 per 1 mg/dL).

Ethnicity, parental myopia and education status were ascertained by self-reported questionnaire. A comprehensive ophthalmic examination was performed, including post-cycloplegic autorefraction and conjunctival UV autofluorescence photography. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) concentrations were determined using mass spectrometry. The association between serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations and prevalent myopia was determined using multivariable logistic regression. Myopia was defined as mean spherical equivalent ≤ -0.5 diopters.</p><p>Results: Of the 946 participants, 221 (23.4%) had myopia (n=725 non-myopic). Myopic subjects had lower serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations compared to non-myopic participants (median 67.6 nmol vs. 72.5 nmol, p=0.003). In univariable analysis, lower serum 25(OH)D3 concentration was associated with higher risk of having myopia (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> for &lt;50nmol/L vs. ≥50nmol/L: 2.63; 95CI% 1.71 - 4.05; p &lt;0.001). This association persisted after adjustment for potential confounders, including age, sex, ethnicity, parental myopia, education status and ocular sun-exposure biomarker score (Adjusted OR 2.07; 95%CI 1.29-3.32; p=0.002).</p><p>Conclusions: Myopic participants had significantly lower 25(OH)D3 concentrations. The prevalence of myopia was significantly higher in individuals with vitamin D deficiency compared to the individuals with sufficient levels. Longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate whether higher serum 25(OH)D3 concentration is protective against myopia or whether it is acting as a proxy for some other biologically effective consequence of sun exposure.</p><p><strong><a href=http://www.iovs.org/content/early/2014/06/25/iovs.14-14589.full.pdf+html>Publisher wants $15 for the PDF</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=myopia-in-chickens-reduced-by-flashing-light-myopia-may-not-be-due-to-low-vitamin-d>Myopia (in chickens) reduced by flashing light (myopia may not be due to low vitamin D)</h3><div class=border style="background-color:#ff9;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:700px"><p><strong>Seems reasonable.

We studied which temporal patterns of bright light are the most potent in suppressing deprivation myopia in chickens.</p><p>Methods: Eight-day-old chickens wore diffusers over one eye to induce deprivation myopia. A reference group (n = 8) was kept under office-like illuminance (500 lux) at a 10:14 light:dark cycle. Episodes of bright light (15 000 lux) were super-imposed on this background as follows. Paradigm I: exposure to constant bright light for either 1 hour (n = 5), 2 hours (n = 5), 5 hours (n = 4) or 10 hours (n = 4). Paradigm II: exposure to repeated cycles of bright light with 50% duty cycle and either 60 minutes (n = 7), 30 minutes (n = 8), 15 minutes (n = 6), 7 minutes (n = 7) or 1 minute (n = 7) periods, provided for 10 hours. Refraction and axial length were measured prior to and immediately after the 5-day experiment. Relative changes were analyzed by paired t-tests, and differences among groups were tested by one-way ANOVA.</p><p>Results: Compared with the reference group, exposure to continuous bright light for 1 or 2 hours every day had no significant protective effect against deprivation myopia. Inhibition of myopia became significant after 5 hours of bright light exposure but extending the duration to 10 hours did not offer an additional benefit. In comparison, repeated cycles of 1:1 or 7:7 minutes of bright light enhanced the protective effect against myopia and could fully suppress its development.</p><p>Conclusions: The protective effect of bright light depends on the exposure duration and, to the intermittent form, the frequency cycle. Compared to the saturation effect of continuous bright light, low frequency cycles of bright light (1:1 min) provided the strongest inhibition effect. However, our quantitative results probably might not be directly translated into humans, but rather need further amendments in clinical studies.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/myopia-reduced-by-flashing-light.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=see-also-web>See also web</h3><ul><li><a href=http://optometrytimes.modernmedicine.com/optometrytimes/news/time-outdoors-and-myopia-case-vitamin-d>Time outdoors and myopia: a case for vitamin D? </a>Optometry Times July 2013, same author as two studies on this page</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Take-Home Message</strong> The CLEERE study followed approximately 5,000 children over time to determine what factors were different between those who became myopic and those who remained emmetropic.

We evaluated the hypothesis that time outdoors might create differences in circulating levels of vitamin D between myopes and non-myopes.</p><p>METHODS: Subjects provided 200 μl of peripheral blood in addition to survey information about dietary intakes and time spent in indoor or outdoor activity. The 22 subjects ranged in age from 13 to 25 years. Myopes (n = 14) were defined as having at least -0.75 diopter of myopia in each principal meridian and non-myopes (n = 8) had +0.25 diopter or more hyperopia in each principal meridian. Blood level of vitamin D was measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy.</p><p>RESULTS: Unadjusted blood levels of vitamin D were not significantly different between myopes ( <strong>13.95</strong> ± 3.75 ng/ml) and non-myopes ( <strong>16.02</strong> ± 5.11 ng/ml, p = 0.29) nor were the hours spent outdoors (myopes = 12.9 ± 7.8 h; non-myopes = 13.6 ± 5.8 h; p = 0.83). In a multiple regression model, total sugar and folate from food were negatively associated with blood vitamin D, whereas theobromine and calcium were positively associated with blood vitamin D. <strong>Myopes had lower levels of blood vitamin D by an average of 3.4 ng/ml compared with non-myopes</strong> when adjusted for age and dietary intakes (p = 0.005 for refractive error group, model R = 0.76). Gender, time outdoors, and dietary intake of vitamin D were not significant in this model.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that time outdoors might create differences in vitamin D could not be evaluated fully because time outdoors was not significantly related to myopia in this small sample. However, adjusted for differences in the intake of dietary variables, myopes appear to have lower average blood levels of vitamin D than non-myopes.

We conducted a case-control study to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within VDR at 12q13.11 and GC at 4q12-13 were associated with myopia.</p><p>Methods. The primary analysis was conducted on 81 white adult control subjects between 18 and 50 years of age with a spherical equivalent refractive error between +0.50 D and +2.00 D in both eyes and less than 1.50 D of astigmatism. Affected myopic subjects were 289 unrelated white adults at least 18 years of age with at least &ndash;0.75 D myopia in both principal meridians of both eyes.</p><p>Results. One SNP within VDR was significantly associated with myopia in the multivariate analysis of the primary sample (rs2853559: odds ratio = 1.99, p = 0.003). In a subsample of less severely myopic white cases between -0.75 D and -4.00 D, three SNPs within VDR were significantly associated in a multivariate model after adjustment for multiple comparisons (rs2239182: odds ratio = 2.17, p = 0.007; rs3819545: odds ratio = 2.34, p = 0.003; rs2853559: odds ratio = 2.14, p = 0.0035), accounting for 12% of model variance over age alone.</p><p>Conclusions: Polymorphisms within VDR appear to be associated with low to moderate amounts of myopia in white subjects. Future studies should determine whether this finding can be replicated and should explore the biological significance of these variations with respect to myopia.</p><p>PMID: 21357399 <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/genes-myopia.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=myopia-a-world-tourhttpjplagaceodwordpresscomcategorymyopia-2><a href=http://jplagaceod.wordpress.com/category/myopia-2/>Myopia: a world tour</a></h3><ul><li>US 1971-1972: 25%, by 1999-2004: 41.6%.</li></ul><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/myopia-urban-vs-rural.jpg alt=image width=450>

A Randomized Clinical Trial</strong></p><p><strong>JAMA</strong> . 2015;314(11):1142-1148. doi:10.1001/jama.2015.10803.</p><p>Mingguang He, MD, PhD1,2; Fan Xiang, MD, PhD1,3; Yangfa Zeng, MD1; Jincheng Mai, BSc4; Qianyun Chen, MSc1; Jian Zhang, MSc1; Wayne Smith, MD, PhD5; Kathryn Rose, PhD6,7; Ian G. Morgan, PhD1,8</p><p>Objective To assess the efficacy of increasing time spent outdoors at school in preventing incident myopia.</p><p>Design, Setting, and Participants Cluster randomized trial of children in grade 1 from 12 primary schools in Guangzhou, China, conducted between October 2010 and October 2013.</p><p>Interventions For 6 intervention schools (n = 952 students), 1 additional 40-minute class of outdoor activities was added to each school day, and parents were encouraged to engage their children in outdoor activities after school hours, especially during weekends and holidays. Children and parents in the 6 control schools (n = 951 students) continued their usual pattern of activity.</p><p>Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measure was the 3-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia (defined using the Refractive Error Study in Children spherical equivalent refractive error standard of ≤−0.5 diopters <span>[D]</span>) among the students without established myopia at baseline. Secondary outcome measures were changes in spherical equivalent refraction and axial length among all students, analyzed using mixed linear models and intention-to-treat principles. Data from the right eyes were used for the analysis.</p><p>Results There were 952 children in the intervention group and 951 in the control group with a mean (SD) age of 6.6 (0.34) years. The cumulative incidence rate of myopia was <strong>30.4% in the intervention group</strong> (259 incident cases among 853 eligible participants) and <strong>39.5% (287 incident cases among 726 eligible participants) in the control group</strong> (difference of −9.1% <span>[95% CI, −14.1% to −4.1%]</span>; P &lt; .001). There was also a significant difference in the 3-year change in spherical equivalent refraction for the intervention group (−1.42 D) compared with the control group (−1.59 D) (difference of 0.17 D <span>[95% CI, 0.01 to 0.33 D]</span>; P = .04). Elongation of axial length was not significantly different between the intervention group (0.95 mm) and the control group (0.98 mm) (difference of −0.03 mm <span>[95% CI, −0.07 to 0.003 mm]</span>; P = .07).</p><p>Conclusions and Relevance Among 6-year-old children in Guangzhou, China, the addition of 40 minutes of outdoor activity at school compared with usual activity resulted in a reduced incidence rate of myopia over the next 3 years. Further studies are needed to assess long-term follow-up of these children and the generalizability of these findings.</p><p>Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00848900</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
