# Great article in [Freakonomics Nov 2011](http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/11/11/healthcare-needs-insurance-companies-like-a-fish-needs-a-bicycle/)

## Mentions a New England Journal of Medicine article which estimated  **<span style="color:#F00;">5.9 % </span>**  of healthcare costs are due to insurance

## This does not include

* Cost of employees who fill and file insurance paperwork 

* Value of patients’ time spent talking to insurance companies

* Medical procedures which are done because the insurance expects them to be done

* Medical procedures done to minimize liability

* Increase cost of drugs in US - some of which had been non-prescription, many others are far less expensive outside of the US

## Cost of Health as a fraction of GDP has been rising very quickly in the US [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States)

## Note that:

* 95 cents of every 'Health Care" US dollar is spent on disease

* The  **<span style="color:#F0F;">UK pays their doctors</span>**  based on about 22 proactive actions the doctors do to PREVENT disease

# Notes from a nice book on the topic The Healing of America by T. R Reid 2009

[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Healing-America-Global-Better-Cheaper/dp/0143118218/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1321210372&sr=8-1) has 157 rave reviews

Looks at 10+ countries way of providing health to ALL of the people

US has the worst of all of them – most expensive and least effective

Even the Swiss have private insurance – but not permitted to make a profit on basic coverage

French has electronic records card that the individual keeps

Most doctors in other countries make normal wages

### UK

* admin cost are 1/5 that of the US

*  **capitation fees – encourages proactive measures** 

* NHS has many quality measures that they pay doctors by – and “best practices” awards up to $125,000 per year

### Japan

* average # of visits per year = 14.5 = 3X of the US

* makes house calls.  Generally just show up – not make an appointment

* average length of stay in hospital 36 days (US 6 days)

* health care cost is just 8% of GDP

* has 3600 different health plans

* pays insurance for unemployed or too poor

* MRI used 3X as much as US – but machine is 1/10 the cost
