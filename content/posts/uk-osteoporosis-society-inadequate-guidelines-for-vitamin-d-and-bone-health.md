There is growing interest in the importance of vitamin D in the maintenance of bone health and the prevention of falls and fractures. Although there is no universal consensus on the criteria for vitamin D deficiency, this is common in the UK, particularly in frail older people <sup>[1]</sup>. This has resulted in a marked increase in requests for serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) estimation, but there has been confusion about the indications for these measurements, interpretation of the results and the management of vitamin D deficiency.

#### Quotes from PDF with comments by VitaminDWiki

* For average adult

> They do not mention dark skin, obese, pregnant, child, or senior

* “Serum 25OHD measurements are not recommended in asymptomatic healthy individuals with no evidence of bone disease.”

* >20 ng is sufficient for almost the whole population

* “Patients with a serum 25OHD above 50 nmol/L should be reassured and given advice on maintaining adequate vitamin D levels through safe sunlight exposure and diet. “

> No suggestion about supplementing: just sunlight and diet

> No comment about the <a href="/posts/low-cost-cofactors-for-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Low cost cofactors for vitamin D">cofactors</a> REQUIRED for bone health

* “Vitamin D2 may be preferred by vegetarians and patients who wish to avoid vitamin D of animal origin because of religious or cultural beliefs”

> They appear to be unaware of the availability of <a href="/posts/vitamin-d3-for-vegans-many-studies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Vitamin D3 for Vegans - many studies">vitamin D3 made from plants</a>

* “ Oral administration of vitamin D is recommended, because of unpredictable bioavailability and slower correction of vitamin D deficiency with intramuscular preparations (7,8).”

* “Loading doses should provide a total of approximately 300,000 IU (7,500 µg) vitamin D, given either as weekly or daily doses.

* “Maintenance treatment should be considered one month after loading, with doses equivalent to 800 to 2,000 IU”
