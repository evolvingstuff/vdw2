#### Swiss in Spring 2020 with high zinc were 5X less likely to have COVID antibodies – April 2023

 **Association of plasma zinc levels with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA seropositivity in the general population: A case-control study** 

Clin Nutr . 2023 Apr 18;42(6):972-986. [doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2023.04.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2023.04.007)

Introduction: Some micronutrients have key roles in immune defence, including mucosal defence mechanisms and immunoglobulin production. Altered micronutrient status has been linked with COVID-19 infection and disease severity. We assessed the associations of selected circulating micronutrients with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA seropositivity in the Swiss community using early pandemic data.

Methods: Case-control study comparing the first PCR-confirmed COVID-19 symptomatic cases in the Vaud Canton (May to June 2020, n = 199) and controls (random population sample, n = 447), seronegative for IgG and IgA. The replication analysis included seropositive (n = 134) and seronegative (n = 152) close contacts from confirmed COVID-19 cases. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA levels against the native trimeric spike protein were measured using the Luminex immunoassay. We measured plasma Zn, Se and Cu concentrations by ICP-MS, and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) with LC-MS/MS and explored associations using multiple logistic regression.

Results: The 932 participants (54.1% women) were aged 48.6 ± 20.2 years (±SD), BMI 25.0 ± 4.7 kg/m2 with median C-Reactive Protein 1 mg/l.

In logistic regressions, log2(Zn) plasma levels were negatively associated with IgG seropositivity (OR <span>[95% CI]</span>:  **0.196**  <span>[0.0831; 0.465]</span>, P < 0.001; replication analyses: 0.294 <span>[0.0893; 0.968]</span>, P < 0.05). Results were similar for IgA. We found no association of Cu, Se, and 25(OH)D3 with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG or IgA seropositivity.

Conclusion: Low plasma Zn levels were associated with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA seropositivity in a Swiss population when the initial viral variant was circulating, and no vaccination available. These results suggest that adequate Zn status may play an important role in protecting the general population against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

BACKGROUND

Zinc supplementation has been considered one of the potential therapies for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). We aimed to examine zinc efficacy in adult patients with COVID-19 infection.

METHODS

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients tested positive for COVID-19 without end organ failure were randomized to oral zinc (n = 231) or matching placebo (n = 239) for 15 days. The primary combined outcome was death due to COVID-19 or ICU admission within 30 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay for inpatients and duration of COVID-19 symptoms with COVID-19 related hospitalization for outpatients.

FINDINGS

One hundred ninety patients (40.4%) were ambulatory and 280 patients (59.6%) were hospitalized. Mortality at 30-day was 6.5% in Zinc group and 9.2% in Placebo group <span>[odds ratio (OR) 0.70 (0.37-1.32)]</span>; 

ICU admission rate was respectively 5.2% and 11.3% <span>[OR 0.46 (0.23-0.88)]</span>. 

Combined outcome was lower in zinc group compared to placebo group <span>[OR 0.62 (0.38-0.99)]</span>. Consistent results were observed in prespecified subgroups of patients with age < 65 years, those with comorbidity, and those who needed oxygen therapy at baseline. Length of hospital stay was shorter in zinc group compared to placebo group <span>[difference 3.5 days, 95% CI (2.76-4.23)]</span> in inpatients group; duration of COVID-19 symptoms decreased with zinc treatment compared to placebo in outpatients <span>[difference 1.9 days, 95% CI (0.62-2.6)]</span>. No severe adverse events were observed during the study.

INTERPRETATION

Our results showed that in COVID-19 patients, oral zinc can decrease 30-day death and ICU admission rate and can shorten symptoms duration.
