Objective: Our study aims to examine the independent and combined associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations and physical activity (PA) status with phenotypic age (PhenoAge).

Method: The analysis included 18,738 participants from the NHANES 2007-2010 & 2015-2018. Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) was calculated as the residuals from regressing PhenoAge on chronological age. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to analysis the relationship between 25(OH)D and PA with PhenoAgeAccel. Population attributable fraction (PAF) was used to estimate the proportion of PhenoAgeAccel which could be avoided if exposure were eliminated.

Results: The multivariate-adjusted OR (95%CI) for PhenoAgeAccel with high 25(OH)D and adequate PA were 0.657 (0.549,0.787) (p < 0.001) for all, 0.663 (0.538,0.818) (p < 0.001) for participants whose age ≤65years old. 

Furthermore, there was multiplicative interaction between 25(OH)D and PA in age ≤65 years old group (0.729 (0.542,0.979), p = 0.036). High 25(OH)D level and adequate PA reduced the risk of PhenoAgeAccel by  **14.3 % and 14.2 %** , respectively. Notably, 30.7 % decrease was attributable to both high 25(OH)D level and engaging in adequate PA concurrently. Combining 25(OH)D above 80.4 nmol/l with PA decreased PhenoAge by 1.291 years (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Higher 25(OH)D level was associated with lower risk of biological ageing. Combining 25(OH)D and PA demonstrated enhanced protective effects, especially in middle or young adults. These findings underscore the importance of outdoor PA in slowing down the aging process.
