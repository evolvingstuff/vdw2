Hundreds to thousands of scientific, medical, & public health experts publicly back vitamin D for COVID-19, including many global top vitamin D experts plus notable public health officials. This is a summary:

More (eg 2x) if overweight/etc.Treatment: Test & treat deficiency, eg w/ <span>[Castillo’20]</span> or <span>[Rastogi’20]</span> protocols. |

Tx: Outpatient 4000 IU/day. Hospital: calcifediol (see link) or 20,000-60,000 IU then 20,000 IU/week. |

| Sep’20 NIAID dir.

| Mar’20 former CDC director [Tom Frieden](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/former-cdc-chief-tom-frieden-coronavirus-risk-may-be-reduced-with-vitamin-d)[Fox News interview](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/former-cdc-chief-tom-frieden-coronavirus-risk-may-be-reduced-with-vitamin-d) | Might help. 800-2000 IU/day prob. safe. 1000 IU/day reasonable. |

Rows 1-4, 5-7, & 8-10 above represent groups on the order of 100+, 10, & 1 experts respectively. [A expanded table is available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KidU3MT77QHfjsJfO9kkZJMBZBmV3rYD_asdzhx3jQY/edit?usp=sharing) with more details & links (including to English translations). The list may not be comprehensisve.

#### Consensus of the recommendations of the above groups and individuals:

* 1. There is clear consensus that evidence is now sufficient to recommend action without waiting for more data.

* 2. There is clear consensus that vitamin D deficiency is important for COVID-19 and should be urgently fixed.

* 3. Most recommend vitamin D for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

* 4. There is almost unanimous agreement to achieve at least 20ng/ml (50nmol/L) serum levels.

* 5. There is clear consensus to recommend daily intakes above current government guidelines, though amounts span a wide range from 800-5000 IU/day. Almost everyone emphasizes the safety of 4000 IU/day.

Some other experts disagree and call for more research, though no disagreeing groups of sizes similar to the top rows above are apparent. Officials in most jurisdictions have not yet added vitamin D as a top-level pandemic mitigation measure alongside distancing, masks, and vaccines. Vitamin D’s importance for COVID-19 has sometimes been labeled misinformation, but clearly it is not as the aggregate expertise here shows. This is an active area of scientific & public health research and discussion. We will someday be better able to estimate which vitamin D policies would have saved the most lives. Meanwhile, the arrayed expertise here suggests that lives could be saved by increased official vitamin D recommendations. Those opposed say only that this is not sufficiently proven, not that increasing vitamin D recommendations is likely to cost more lives than it would save. The imbalance of risk is clear. Many lives are still on the line.
