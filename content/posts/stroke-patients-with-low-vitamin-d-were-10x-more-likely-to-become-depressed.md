Vitamin D levels were measured immediately after the stroke

1 in 3 were depressed 6 months after surviving their stroke

Those with levels < 11 ng were, on average, 10X more likely to be depressed 6 months later

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10X was the average. The range of 5X to 29X more likely!

Note also: Depression is strongly associated with low vitamin D 

Note also: Depressed are somewhat more likely to get a stroke – see VitaminDWiki below

Our aim was to determine whether there was a relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span> D) and post-stroke depression (PSD). Two hundred and forty-four ischemic stroke patients admitted to the hospital within the first 24 h after stroke onset were consecutively recruited and followed up for 6 months. Clinical information was collected. Serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels were measured at baseline. Based on the symptoms, diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for depression at 6-month after stroke. 

At 6-month, 91 patients ( **37.3 %** ) showed depression and in 60 patients (24.6 %) this depression was classified as major. 

There was a significant difference in median serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels between PSD patients and no depression cases [8.3 (IQR, 6.8-9.5) vs. 15.6 (IQR, 13.2-20.3) ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.001](8.3%20(IQR,%206.8-9.5)%20vs.%2015.6%20(IQR,%2013.2-20.3)%20ng/ml,%20respectively;%20P%20<%200.001). 

Serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels ≤11.2 ng/ml were independently associated with PSD <span>[odds ratio 10.32, 95 % confidence interval 4.97-28.63; P < 0.001]</span>, after adjusting for possible confounders. 

Serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels reduced at admission was found to be associated with PSD. Additional research is needed on vitamin D supplementation to improve the outcome of patients with PSD.

* Post-stroke depression (PSD) is considered the most frequent and important neuropsychiatric consequence of stroke. Approximately  **one-third of stroke survivors**  experience major depression. Moreover this condition can have an adverse effect on cognitive function, functional recovery and survival.
