This &lt;strong>consensus statement&lt;/strong> , supported by the Child Abuse Committee and endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Society for Pediatric Radiology, synthesizes the relevant scientific data distinguishing clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings of metabolic disease from findings in abusive injury.

&lt;p>Vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is associated with disturbed skeletal homeostasis during infancy. Our aim was to investigate the influence of adherence to recommendations for vitamin D supplement intake of 10 μg per day (400 IU) during pregnancy (mother) and in the first months of life (child) on the occurrence of positional skull deformation of the child at the age of 2 to 4 months. In an observational case–control study, two hundred seventy-five 2- to 4-month-old cases with positional skull deformation were compared with 548 matched controls. A questionnaire was used to gather information on background characteristics and vitamin D intake (food, time spent outdoors and supplements). In a multiple variable logistic regression analysis, insufficient vitamin D supplement intake of women during the last trimester of pregnancy &lt;span>[adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.86, 95% (CI) 1.27–2.70]&lt;/span> and of children during early infancy &lt;strong>(aOR 7.15&lt;/strong> , 95% CI 3.77–13.54) were independently associated with an increased risk of skull deformation during infancy. These associations were evident after adjustment for the associations with skull deformation that were present with younger maternal age and lower maternal education, shorter pregnancy duration, assisted vaginal delivery, male gender and milk formula consumption after birth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Child abuse, vitamin D deficiency, or what - for parents and defense attorneys - Cannell</title><link>/posts/child-abuse-vitamin-d-deficiency-or-what-for-parents-and-defense-attorneys-cannell.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/child-abuse-vitamin-d-deficiency-or-what-for-parents-and-defense-attorneys-cannell.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="i-classfas-fa-file-pdf-stylemargin-right-03emia-hrefhttpsd378j1rmrlek7xcloudfrontnetattachmentspdfcannell-sanchez-p36-46-multiple-rib-fractures-june-2015-06222015-435-bcxpdfdownload-the-pdf-from-vitamindwikia">&lt;i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;">&lt;/i>&lt;a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/cannell-sanchez-p36-46-multiple-rib-fractures-june-2015-06222015-435-bcx.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

We did a retrospective analysis of 52 post-mortem cases (aged 2 days to 10 years). 17 children had vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;25nmol/L); 24 children had vitamin D insufficiency (25-49nmol/L); 10 children had suboptimal vitamin D levels (50-79nmol/L) and only 1 child had adequate levels ({greater than or equal to} 80nmol/L).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets in half of premature births – 200 IU of vitamin D is enough – RCT</title><link>/posts/rickets-in-half-of-premature-births-200-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-enough-rct.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-in-half-of-premature-births-200-iu-of-vitamin-d-is-enough-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="prophylactic-effect-of-low-dose-vitamin-d-in-osteopenia-of-prematurity-a-clinical-trial-study">Prophylactic Effect of Low Dose Vitamin D in Osteopenia of Prematurity: A Clinical Trial Study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Osteopenia of prematurity (OOP) is a preventable disease. Improved survival of newborns with OOP is associated with an increased incidence of OOP. The purpose of this study was to compare the prophylactic effects of two low doses of vitamin D (200 and 400 IU/Day) on the clinical, biochemical and radiological indices of the rickets of prematurity. In a randomized clinical trial, 60 preterm newborns with birth weight &amp;lt; 2000 g &amp;amp; gestational age &amp;lt; 37 weeks were randomly divided in two groups. Thirty newborns received 200 IU/d of vitamin D in group one and 30 ones received 400 IU/day of vitamin D in group two. On the 6th and 8th weeks of life, serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphates, and 25 - hydroxy vitamin D concentrations were measured and x- ray of left wrist and physical examination were performed. Both groups had no difference in biochemical, radiological or clinical presentation of rickets. Current study indicated that low dose vitamin D (200 IU/Day) is enough for prevention of OOP.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets in England – huge recent increase</title><link>/posts/rickets-in-england-huge-recent-increase.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-in-england-huge-recent-increase.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="hospitalisation-for-children-with-rickets-in-england-a-historical-perspective">Hospitalisation for children with rickets in England: a historical perspective&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>A nationwide &amp;lsquo;vitamin D prophylaxis augmentation programme&amp;rsquo; initiated in 2005 in Turkey reduced the prevalence of rickets from 6% in 1998 to 0.1% in 2008 in children under 3 years of age. The programme included free distribution of vitamin D drops to all newborns and infants (0-12 months) visiting primary health stations throughout the country. Free disposal of vitamin D to infants is an effective strategy for preventing vitamin D-deficient rickets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maternal vitamin D deficiency can trigger rickets in breastfed infants – review</title><link>/posts/maternal-vitamin-d-deficiency-can-trigger-rickets-in-breastfed-infants-review.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/maternal-vitamin-d-deficiency-can-trigger-rickets-in-breastfed-infants-review.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="maternal-vitamin-d-deficiency-triggering-rickets-in-their-breastfeeding-infants-a-current-study-and-literature-review">Maternal vitamin D deficiency triggering rickets in their breastfeeding infants: a current study and Literature Review&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The aim of this study is to confirm our original hypothesis that maternal deficiency of vitamin D is a major factor in development of rickets in her breastfeeding infant and review the literature. In six months from October 2008 to March 2009 out of 136 infants with diagnosis of clinical rickets, seen in Medinah Maternty and Chlidrens Hospital, 40 infants and their mothers were included in this study. Sochioeconomical data were recorded. Blood samples were collected for biochemical and for parathormone and vitamin D (25OHD) levels from both mother and baby. Radiology of wrist was done for each infant. All cases were divided to three age groups. Results from pairs were available. On comparing parathormone (MPTH) in mothers of children (CPTH) with active rickets and healed rickets. MPTH was 94.8 and CPTH 199.9, this was considered significant at P value .0104. As for children with healed rickets and their mother&amp;rsquo;s PTH the mean PTH was 199.8 in active rickets and 60.8 in healed rickets, the P value is 0.002 which is very significant. The 25OHD levels in mother and breastfed infants with active rickets were very low in infants with active rickets and low in their mothers. In the healed group 25OHD was significantly high in infants but not in mothers. The hypothesis that maternal vitamin D deficiency is a major factor in pathogenesis of their infants was further confirmed. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and lactation for the mother and breastfeeding infants is recommended to prevent vitamin D deficiency and rickets and their serious complications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Child bone conference: many vitamin D and ricket abstracts</title><link>/posts/child-bone-conference-many-vitamin-d-and-ricket-abstracts.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/child-bone-conference-many-vitamin-d-and-ricket-abstracts.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#F00;">6th International Conference on Children&amp;rsquo;s bone Health&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bone health is a critical concern in managing preterm infants. Key nutrients of importance are calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus. Although human milk is critical for the health of preterm infants, it is low in these nutrients relative to the needs of the infants during growth. Strategies should be in place to fortify human milk for preterm infants with birth weight &amp;lt;1800 to 2000 g and to ensure adequate mineral intake during hospitalization and after hospital discharge. Biochemical monitoring of very low birth weight infants should be performed during their hospitalization. Vitamin D should be provided at 200 to 400 IU/day both during hospitalization and after discharge from the hospital. Infants with radiologic evidence of rickets should have efforts made to maximize calcium and phosphorus intake by using available commercial products and, if needed, direct supplementation with these minerals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perhaps half of Russian children have rickets, 500 IU vitamin D was not enough</title><link>/posts/perhaps-half-of-russian-children-have-rickets-500-iu-vitamin-d-was-not-enough.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/perhaps-half-of-russian-children-have-rickets-500-iu-vitamin-d-was-not-enough.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="role-of-exogenous-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-pathogenesis-of-rickets">ROLE OF EXOGENOUS VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY IN PATHOGENESIS OF RICKETS&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Nutritional rickets in Nigerian children usually results from dietary calcium insufficiency. Typical dietary calcium intakes in African children are about 200mg daily (approximately 20-28% of US RDAs for age). We sought to determine if rickets could be prevented with supplemental calcium or with an indigenous food rich in calcium. We enrolled Nigerian children aged 12 to 18 months from three urban communities. Two communities were assigned calcium, either as calcium carbonate (400mg) or ground fish (529±109mg) daily, while children in all three communities received vitamin A (2500IU) daily as placebo. Serum markers of mineral homeostasis and forearm bone density (pDEXA) were measured and radiographs were obtained at enrollment and after 18months of supplementation. The overall prevalence of radiographic rickets at baseline was 1.2% and of vitamin D deficiency &lt;a href="serum%2025(OH)D%3C12ng/ml">serum 25(OH)D&amp;lt;12ng/ml&lt;/a> 5.4%. Of 647 children enrolled, 390 completed the 18-month follow-up. Rickets developed in 1, 1, and 2 children assigned to the calcium tablet, ground fish, and control groups, respectively (approximate incidence 6.4/1000 children/year between 1 and 3years of age). Children who developed rickets in the calcium-supplemented groups had less than 50% adherence. Compared with the group that received no calcium supplementation, the groups that received calcium had a greater increase in areal bone density of the distal and proximal 1/3 radius and ulna over time (P&amp;lt;0.04). We conclude that calcium supplementation increased areal bone density at the radius and ulna, but a larger sample size would be required to determine its effect on the incidence of rickets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Children with pneumonia in Ethiopia were 22X more likely to have rickets – 1997</title><link>/posts/children-with-pneumonia-in-ethiopia-were-22x-more-likely-to-have-rickets-1997.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/children-with-pneumonia-in-ethiopia-were-22x-more-likely-to-have-rickets-1997.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="case-control-study-of-the-role-of-nutritional-rickets-in-the-risk-of-developing-pneumonia-in-ethiopian-children">Case-control study of the role of nutritional rickets in the risk of developing pneumonia in Ethiopian children.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Acute lower respiratory infections, predominantly pneumonia, kill more children under the age of five in every region of the world 1 than any other cause. In 2007, of the estimated nine million child deaths that occurred globally, close to 20% or 1.8 million were attributable to pneumonia. Undernutrition has been shown to both increase the severity and overall prevalence of acute lower respiratory infections and is an important factor in determining the mortality rates from severe forms of respiratory infections1–4.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Majority of Medici in 1600's who died in infancy had rickets - 2013</title><link>/posts/majority-of-medici-in-1600s-who-died-in-infancy-had-rickets-2013.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/majority-of-medici-in-1600s-who-died-in-infancy-had-rickets-2013.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="showhide_heading" id="Nature_News_-_June_2013">

&lt;p>Recent case reports highlight the resurgence of rickets in certain groups of breastfed infants. Infants residing in the North, irrespective of skin color, and dark-skinned African American infants residing anywhere in the United States are most vulnerable to nutritional rickets if they are exclusively breastfed past age 6 months without vitamin D supplementation. &lt;strong>At the turn of the 20th century, rickets was nearly universal among African American infants living in the North&lt;/strong> . The discovery of vitamin D, the initiation of public health campaigns to fortify infant foods with vitamin D, and the supplementation of vitamin D to breastfed infants were responsible for overcoming the rickets scourge. We review a classic nutritional study by Alfred F. Hess, one of the greatest clinical nutritional researchers of the early 20th century, in the context of the resurgence of rickets, especially among dark-skinned infants. The Columbus Hill district, a black community of New York, NY, served as the setting for the study. Sixty-five infants (aged 1-17 months) entered a 6-month open-label trial of daily cod liver oil therapy. Participants were assessed for signs of rickets at recruitment and at 2, 4, and 6 months. Cod liver oil prevented the development of rickets in 34 (92%) of 37 infants treated for 6 months and in 7 (58%) of 12 treated for 4 months. Of the 16 infants who did not take the prescribed treatment, rickets progressed unremittingly in 15. Hess translated his success into a public health campaign leading to the development of the first rickets clinic in 1917. This was the first step in the conquest of the rickets epidemic of the early 20th century.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets associated with 30 percent of infant deaths in rural Netherlands in 1800’s</title><link>/posts/rickets-associated-with-30-percent-of-infant-deaths-in-rural-netherlands-in-1800s.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-associated-with-30-percent-of-infant-deaths-in-rural-netherlands-in-1800s.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-in-a-post-medieval-farming-community-from-the-netherlands">Vitamin D Deficiency in a Post-Medieval Farming Community from the Netherlands&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Rickets is caused by vitamin D deficiency as a result of limited exposure to sunlight and inadequate diet. In the 19th century, rickets was endemic in most northern European cities. In post-Medieval Netherlands rickets is documented in low frequencies in a few urban samples, but has not been studied in contemporaneous rural populations. Beemster is a rural farming community in the Netherlands that was established in the 17th century upon drained land, with the Middenbeemster cemetery in use until 1866 AD. Ninety-five individuals from the ages of 32 weeks in utero to fifteen years were examined for rickets in order to understand factors that can cause vitamin D deficiency in rural, non-industrialized populations. To identify rickets in the Beemster sample, ten features were scored, with bending deformities of the lower limb and one other feature, or at least three non-bending features, having to be present in order for diagnosis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets in 80 percent of infants with severe pneumonia</title><link>/posts/rickets-in-80-percent-of-infants-with-severe-pneumonia.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-in-80-percent-of-infants-with-severe-pneumonia.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="frequency-of-nutritional-rickets-in-children-admitted-with-severe-pneumonia">Frequency of nutritional rickets in children admitted with severe pneumonia.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Rickets is an important problem even in countries with adequate sun exposure. The causes of rickets/osteomalacia are varied and include nutritional deficiency, especially poor dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium. Non-nutritional causes include hypophosphatemic rickets primarily due to renal phosphate losses and rickets due to renal tubular acidosis. In addition, some varieties are due to inherited defects in vitamin D metabolism and are called vitamin D dependent rickets. This chapter highlights rickets/osteomalacia related to vitamin D deficiency or to inherited defects in vitamin D metabolism. Hypophosphatemic rickets and rickets due to renal tubular acidosis are discussed in other sections of the journal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The decade of ideas leading to a cure for rickets</title><link>/posts/the-decade-of-ideas-leading-to-a-cure-for-rickets.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-decade-of-ideas-leading-to-a-cure-for-rickets.html</guid><description>&lt;p>J Pediatr. 2012 Mar;160(3):508-10. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.10.031.">doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.10.031.&lt;/a> Epub 2011 Dec 3.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rickets is a heterogeneous group of diseases of the growing child caused by defect mineralization of bone. Nutritional rickets is caused by deficiency of vitamin D, calcium or both. Several hereditary forms of rickets exist where the disease proceeds into adulthood. Nutritional rickets was common in the past, but by introduction of preventative administration of cod liver oil and vitamin D supplementation, nutritional rickets became a rarity. During the last decades, case reports of nutritional rickets reappear in the industrialized countries. It is the general conception that in the industrialized countries, hereditary rickets is the most prevalent cause of rickets today. However, the incidence of nutritional rickets and the incidence and prevalence of hereditary rickets in Scandinavia are unknown. The most common form of hereditary rickets is hypophosphatemic rickets (HR). The geno- and phenotype among Scandinavian patients have not been characterized. Especially, the disease in adult patients is not well described. Moreover, there are conflicting reports of the benefits of medical treatment throughout childhood, and in addition on gender differences in disease severity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency spares no body part – NE Asia</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-spares-no-body-part-ne-asia.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-spares-no-body-part-ne-asia.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-in-north-east-asian-clinical-nutrition-practice">Vitamin D in North-East Asian clinical nutrition practice&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Sound clinical nutrition practice is grounded in evidence and stimulated by research. Yet, there are unanswered questions about food-health relationships. Clinical nutrition involves the identification of nutritional disorders and the motivation to rectify them with all required care. Vitamin D health exemplifies the biomedical, societal and environmental dimensions of clinical nutrition, its science and practice. It depends most of all on access to sunshine and food and probably represents a paradigm in human health which is still at its beginning. Nevertheless, the problem of its deficiency is much more widespread and common than has been thought since it was first identified as a cause of rickets and osteomalacia. &lt;strong>It is now known to spare no body organ or system&lt;/strong> . The problem in North-East Asia is comparable to much of the rest of the world, but the risk profile for it is &lt;strong>exaggerated by atmospheric pollution, cultures with sun-avoidance on account of skin colour&lt;/strong> and potentially mitigated by foodstuffs like fish, eggs, organ meats and mushrooms which can partially offset sunshine-deficiency. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and confirmation by biochemistry which may not be affordable. Therefore a close working relationship between public health and clinical nutritionist is essential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D deficiency in Middle East and North Africa</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-middle-east-and-north-africa.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="hypovitaminosis-d-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-prevalence-risk-factors-and-impact-on-outcomes">Hypovitaminosis D in the Middle East and North Africa: Prevalence, risk factors and impact on outcomes&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Rickets, once thought vanquished, is reappearing. &lt;strong>In some less developed countries it hardly went away.&lt;/strong> This seminar reviews the effects of genes, stage of development, and environment on clinical expression of the disease. Rickets can be secondary to disorders of the gut, pancreas, liver, kidney, or metabolism; however, it is mostly due to nutrient deficiency and we concentrate on this form. Although calcium deficiency contributes in communities where little cows&amp;rsquo; milk is consumed, &lt;strong>deficiency of vitamin D is the main cause&lt;/strong> .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets: Less costly to prevent than to treat SE Asians in UK – 2006</title><link>/posts/rickets-less-costly-to-prevent-than-to-treat-se-asians-in-uk-2006.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-less-costly-to-prevent-than-to-treat-se-asians-in-uk-2006.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-prevention-or-treatment">Vitamin D deficiency: prevention or treatment?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Rickets and osteomalacia are increasing in prevalence in people because of cultural practices, breast-feeding, decreased sun exposure, and increased sunscreen usage. Several hereditary forms of rickets owing to either renal phosphate wasting or defects in vitamin D metabolism are also reported in people. Rickets is well recognized in domestic animals, but published reports are not always supported by microscopic findings, and diagnoses based on clinical signs and radiology are unreliable. Most cases in domestic animals are caused by dietary deficiency of either vitamin D or phosphorus, but occasional inherited forms are reported in pigs, sheep, cats, and dogs. There is variation between species in susceptibility to dietary vitamin D and phosphorus deficiency and in the ability to manufacture vitamin D in their skin. A number of mouse models have been discovered or created to study human skeletal diseases and skeletal homeostasis. With the discovery that vitamin D is involved in not only calcium and phosphorus homeostasis but also in the immune system and cancer, there is great potential for new and existing animal models to generate valuable information about vitamin D and its many functions. This review presents an overview of vitamin D metabolism and rickets in domestic and laboratory animals and makes comparisons where appropriate with the disease in humans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rare Nutritional Rickets increased 10X in 20 years</title><link>/posts/rare-nutritional-rickets-increased-10x-in-20-years.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rare-nutritional-rickets-increased-10x-in-20-years.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Vitamin D, Cod-Liver Oil, Sunlight, and Rickets: A Historical Perspective – 2003</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-cod-liver-oil-sunlight-and-rickets-a-historical-perspective-2003.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-cod-liver-oil-sunlight-and-rickets-a-historical-perspective-2003.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Pediatrics Vol. 112 No. 2 August 1, 2003 pp. e132 -e135&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rickets, a disease of vitamin D deficiency, is rarely confronted by the practicing pediatrician in the United States today. At the turn of the 20th century, rickets was rampant among the poor children living in the industrialized and polluted northern cities of the United States. With the discovery of vitamin D and the delineation of the anti-rachitic properties of cod-liver oil by the 1930s, it became possible to not only treat but also eradicate rickets in the United States. Rickets was a common disease in 17th century England. Frances Glisson’s treatise on rickets published in 1650, a glorious contribution to English medicine, described the clinical and anatomic features of rickets in great detail. The exact etiology of rickets had been elusive until the 1920s. During the Glissonian era, rickets was a mysterious disease. By the late 19th and early 20th century, faulty diet or faulty environment (poor hygiene, lack of fresh air and sunshine) or lack of exercise was implicated in its etiology. Animal experiments, appreciation of folklore advocating the benefits of cod-liver oil, and the geographical association of rickets to lack of sunshine were all relevant factors in the advancement of knowledge in the conquest of this malady. In this article, the history of rickets pertaining to the discovery of vitamin D, cod-liver oil, and sunlight is reviewed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rickets cured for 3 months with 10,000 IU per kg vitamin D (600,000 IU max)</title><link>/posts/rickets-cured-for-3-months-with-10000-iu-per-kg-vitamin-d-600000-iu-max.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rickets-cured-for-3-months-with-10000-iu-per-kg-vitamin-d-600000-iu-max.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="clinical-biochemical-and-radiological-manifestations-of-severe-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adolescents-versus-children-response-to-therapy">Clinical, biochemical and radiological manifestations of severe vitamin d deficiency in adolescents versus children: response to therapy.&lt;/h4>
