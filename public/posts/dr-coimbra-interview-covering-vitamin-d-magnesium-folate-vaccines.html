given</p><p>so interesting that we ask for</p><p>it back and tell all to you</p><p>the teacher reminds thank you for</p><p>your generous availability tac</p><p>us our listeners more health</p><p>of the whole Brazil and beyond Brazil</p><p>taking advantage of already sending hi to</p><p>our our Portuguese brothers we</p><p>watch also not only what&rsquo;s</p><p>going on that today we are with</p><p>so much infertility</p><p>but after this woman can</p><p>get pregnant as she could be</p><p>helping that baby since the middle</p><p>bb environment is she optimize</p><p>improve throughout not only the cognitive part</p><p>but emotionally also that child</p><p>first gratitude is all my</p><p>guarantees to make sure I am very grateful for the</p><p>opportunity you offer to bring</p><p>this information public it should</p><p>feel that way too so it are</p><p>many factors not are many factors</p><p>but I think there are factors is that</p><p>are critical we could mention one by one</p><p>from among these criticisms in a way</p><p>summed up to a critical point i am</p><p>are the two major shortcomings of the</p><p>world&rsquo;s population and mostly or</p><p>accidental vitamin D deficiency is a something</p><p>very important people today are not</p><p>exposed to the sun</p><p>they live and work in environments</p><p>confined not supplementation with vitamin d</p><p>the fact that vitamin d have that name</p><p>wrong vitamin is because it is much</p><p>more than a hormone</p><p>people find you will find</p><p>vitamin d in food that has</p><p>a balanced diet but did not</p><p>finish the amount which has the</p><p>food should end and whimsy</p><p>the result is because of the</p><p>change of the population habits</p><p>is not because the vitamin D produced in the</p><p>leg when you expose one</p><p>individual habits postponing changes</p><p>fast the population that have occurred in</p><p>recent decades but generation</p><p>malls in people abandoned parks start using</p><p>sunscreen listening to a adding to</p><p>plenty of fun in between four</p><p>walls in confined environments such as the</p><p>internet and videogame is and similar to</p><p>today we have nine out of ten</p><p>people on disability with planet</p><p>vitamin D that is made worse by its own factors</p><p>of diet that people gradually</p><p>acquired able to diet wrong that</p><p>people gradually acquired</p><p>along these same decades in</p><p>reducing the consumption of greens leaves</p><p>raw green that has a reason <strong>folate</strong></p><p>that vitamin b9 natural as important</p><p>to maintain the altered genes that all</p><p>we have silent and bb own in</p><p>that when forming in the womb</p><p>mother he received the genes both</p><p>changed both the father and the mother and</p><p>he needs natural vitamin b9 to</p><p>increase <strong>folate</strong> to keep silent</p><p>these altered genes in such a way that</p><p>it does not develop a training with</p><p>birth defects and has the</p><p>development of optimized brain</p><p>so it&rsquo;s important that we</p><p>talk numbers I think it&rsquo;s something</p><p>objective is not mine and I have</p><p>insisted and will avail new this</p><p>opportunity you me always offers</p><p>all the other should take 10,000</p><p>units of vitamin d per day</p><p>this is far from a dose</p><p>toxic is recognized by all</p><p>researchers of this vitamin area d</p><p>as a a free dose effects</p><p>toxic since that the person has at least 50</p><p>kilos there is no problem in</p><p>taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per</p><p>day and we could not because of the</p><p>habits of modern urban modern life to</p><p>get this through sun exposure is</p><p>virtually impossible right because the</p><p>only natural source of vitamin D in the</p><p>skin exposure to the sun</p><p>the aam then 10 000 units per day is</p><p>half the maximum you produce for</p><p>a few minutes of sun exposure</p><p>so it is very important that we</p><p>say that imagine a person who has</p><p>fair skin who is young has fur young</p><p>is lying in the pool under the sun</p><p>strong right with almost all your body</p><p>exposed to the sun is able to produce 20</p><p>to 25 thousand units of vitamin d then</p><p>no one will ever be intoxicated with vitamin</p><p>d by sun exposure</p><p>are 10,000 units of vitamin d is</p><p>half the maximum you produce in ten</p><p>minutes of sun exposure</p><p>this way without using sunscreen</p><p>then and we have observed that mothers</p><p>who take 10,000 units of vitamin d</p><p>during pregnancy them on rules</p><p>give birth to babies who shows the</p><p>psychomotor development out of the ordinary</p><p>are actually children</p><p>I am very hesitant to use this expression</p><p>but in this case I have no doubt they</p><p>are gifted children we agree</p><p>We have beautiful experiences in the office</p><p>just as well because as a dose</p><p>that nutritionist can not pass</p><p>so thank God I have doctors who</p><p>can sustain that this dosage and</p><p>have seen people things very</p><p>interesting that we then</p><p>is exchanging experiences</p><p>is fabulous a child gestated in the middle</p><p>atmosphere where the mother is 10,000 units</p><p>International daily of vitamin d</p><p>is another child you even one day</p><p>can suddenly do not you can not really</p><p>do all that we want but it was</p><p>very interesting you can see the</p><p>difference but still the teacher has</p><p>a lot to talk</p><p>it is important you dream is not true</p><p>then you might think if you&rsquo;re you</p><p>need <strong>magnesium</strong> to activate</p><p>vitamin D for you do not</p><p>ingest or produce the skin</p><p>vitamin D on the inactive form</p><p>then the population in the western population</p><p>we have 80% of disabled population</p><p><strong>magnesium</strong> because the foods that are</p><p>consumed are foods that is that</p><p>foods are rich in <strong>magnesium</strong> are not</p><p>consumed came imagines hissing</p><p>if you want to have a baby with</p><p>brain development to optimized that</p><p>will actually take will show whether</p><p>a child It has a potential</p><p>emotional cognitive instability</p><p>emotional unusual that surprises</p><p>the parents</p><p>you have to give mainly</p><p>vitamin D <strong>magnesium</strong> proper doses</p><p>you have to give up these habits</p><p>such as in managing soft</p><p>glue that dramatically damaged the</p><p>absorption of <strong>magnesium</strong> you have to have</p><p>vegetables in their food vegetables</p><p>raw in bringing methyl <strong>folate</strong> and</p><p>vegetables in general already bring a sliver</p><p>crowns or no longer bring <strong>magnesium</strong></p><p>but you can implement magnesia you</p><p>can implement <strong>magnesium</strong> you can</p><p>further <strong>folate</strong> vitamin b9</p><p>natural you can take the 10 000</p><p>vitamin d units</p><p>you should not should not take acid</p><p>folic during pregnancy not to</p><p>harm including the development</p><p>of the child brain and overall health</p><p>ah and prevent this child has to</p><p>express genes that cause the sam that</p><p>cause diseases that cause</p><p>congenital malformations</p><p>so if we could dream so</p><p>with a with that all pregnant women and</p><p>follow that this view</p><p>is exactly you imagine what would</p><p>happen 20 years from now with this</p><p>country will be wonderful but you are</p><p>here to attend teacher who</p><p>left thank god we will be here</p><p>we will see a wonderful generation</p><p>coming up you are having A paper</p><p>fantastic in promoting that this</p><p>birth of these perez and people that just</p><p>can because this vehicle</p><p>communication network new song</p><p>&rsquo;ve talked to you if I can bring</p><p>people like Professor cícero with an</p><p>international genius is because here we</p><p>can talk about all that our</p><p>commitment is to the truth and the truth</p><p>will set you free teacher what else I</p><p>say today that we will change now the</p><p>next generation</p><p>good think it&rsquo;s important we talk</p><p>about this big problem on</p><p>autism explosion will not have to and</p><p>all these guidelines we</p><p>mentioned in the administration sacked</p><p><strong>folate</strong> and not folic acid</p><p>administration of 10,000 units during</p><p>pregnancy effectively prevents the</p><p>emergence of born the birth of</p><p>autistic children</p><p>today there are very clear data</p><p>demonstrating that autism optimism is</p><p>an autoimmune disease Community industry it can be</p><p>even treated with vitamin d in</p><p>when we settled</p><p>I think one thing a true crime</p><p>is not we let so many people with</p><p>vitamin deficiency to vaccinate</p><p>these children because I am not against</p><p>the <strong>vaccine</strong> only for the <strong>vaccine</strong> but vaccinate</p><p>a population that disability and</p><p>efficient and vitamin d that is so</p><p>important vitamin D based mental</p><p>for you and your immune system</p><p>work in your favor and not against you</p><p>in so you have a low level of</p><p>vitamin D allows you to trigger the</p><p>immune system for example through</p><p>another time <strong>vaccination</strong> until a</p><p>opposition denies one</p><p>there such a virus situation and</p><p>bacteria in an infection I wanted to</p><p>tell you trigger the system</p><p>immune deregulated by a lack of</p><p>vitamin immune system to</p><p>can attack your own body and</p><p>often you notice that sometimes</p><p>days after a <strong>vaccination</strong> the child changes</p><p>his behavior and months later is</p><p>characterized as having an</p><p>autistic behavior is against non</p><p><strong>vaccine</strong> is to vaccinate without the protection of</p><p>vitamin D speaking children it takes we will</p><p>leave this mother</p><p>a given what the vitamin D dose</p><p>for children for example is calculated</p><p>per kilogram of weight right we a</p><p>generally have suggested that children</p><p>at birth right is not being breastfed by mothers</p><p>taking adequate doses of vitamin d</p><p>that are miguel 10min that chicken</p><p>during the entire period of breastfeeding</p><p>which has to be kept exactly but</p><p>if the child child must receive</p><p>it is not the case and even if it would</p><p>that is being nursed by the mother who</p><p>takes 10,000 units no problem</p><p>no she said birth already receive</p><p>thousand units are independent of the weight</p><p>that it has a tinge thousand by 15</p><p>thousand international units per day and</p><p>from then when it reaches 10 kilos</p><p>of weight it starts to take two thousand</p><p>units 15 000 3000 units ie</p><p>five kilos more adds</p><p>another thousand units</p><p>we go for a quick break and</p><p>we came back because today Dr.</p><p>coimbra will give us the recipe to</p><p>have a generation here 20 years</p><p>wonderful program and wait for more</p><p>health today marking history for all</p><p>this new generation what we can</p><p>do to improve health</p><p>behavior cognition finally change this</p><p>generation that I am well even said that</p><p>they are having another problem in</p><p>school learning right</p><p>now is but the endocrinology society that</p><p>Brazil launched a documentation and</p><p>reported that 20 kg per</p><p>deciliter of vitamin blood d is already</p><p>considered good</p><p>this is half the minimum which is a dock on</p><p>its website that the technology company</p><p>north American recommended as the minimum</p><p>then again pregnant woman what</p><p>she needs to do 10,000 units</p><p>vitamin d have to take a day</p><p><strong>magnesium</strong> <strong>magnesium</strong> supplementation</p><p>least 800 milligrams</p><p>have to take care of this issue</p><p>800 milligrams to for example 500</p><p>milligrams of <strong>magnesium</strong> chloride has only</p><p>60 milligrams of <strong>magnesium</strong></p><p>is then so must be</p><p>if a <strong>magnesium</strong> already capsule has to</p><p>look have to note this is not only</p><p>a <strong>magnesium</strong> chloride recipe</p><p>on the radio for us is how chloride</p><p><strong>magnesium</strong> have and have sachets of 33 grams</p><p>available in any ordinary drugstore</p><p>dirt - cheap $ 10 for seven days of</p><p>treatment you put a known content a</p><p>sachet one liter of water and 50ml you take</p><p>four times a day is a day to be an</p><p>American cup or so but will</p><p>decide it at the time - it&rsquo;s a little bit</p><p>I want it but it&rsquo;s her he</p><p>must take before an hour before the</p><p>power not to cause diarrhea</p><p>is due to reduce the dose</p><p>we have recommended that one</p><p>take the highest dose of <strong>magnesium</strong></p><p>can do that it will</p><p>include every day always with the</p><p>gut every day without having diarrhea</p><p>that is not there you that this is what has</p><p>been recommended to the literature</p><p>because the use of laboratory tests</p><p><strong>magnesium</strong> do not reflect their need</p><p>anne so no use looking exams</p><p>lab on the issue of vitamin D if you</p><p>take 10 to 10 thousand units per day</p><p>people of lower weight as we have 50</p><p>fifty-odd kilos may even</p><p>spend a little of what the laboratory</p><p>considers as normal so in grams per ml</p><p>but see search the fishermen have 160</p><p>9 grams per ml called up here is a</p><p>natural question is not is not</p><p>really toxic dose just</p><p>above 100 not grams per ml</p><p>but if we really say that 20 on the</p><p>long but a little more than twenty-</p><p>nine grams per ml is the correct dose is</p><p>a full right concentration better</p><p>off than if they touch by tax 30 is</p><p>for people in risk groups is the love</p><p>of God people with the risk group is</p><p>totally another story right</p><p>teacher come is that part</p><p>emotional as we may be</p><p>showing to the people</p><p>especially for these next mothers are</p><p>carriers of these super bbc the future</p><p>what they need to take care of is the</p><p>emotional is critical not have</p><p>experiments that are even made with</p><p>mice in which you submit both rats</p><p>males and females to stress using the</p><p>noise that the biggest most stressor</p><p>mice for rats and after</p><p>subjecting them to a period where a high</p><p>noise level you put these animals to</p><p>mate and you see that the offspring is born</p><p>with several various malformations</p><p>congenital conclusion is the father of stress</p><p>is the mother&rsquo;s stress that you</p><p>alter the genetics of shirts of</p><p>performances brothers and egg and bringing</p><p>those that child then not having to</p><p>silence their altered genes because</p><p>stress takes but from what we</p><p>could say it&rsquo;s just so the</p><p>public could understand right we have the</p><p>ability if we have methyl <strong>folate</strong></p><p>natural vitamin b9 and is not the acid</p><p>folic not acid folic our body</p><p>has the ability to place as</p><p>were tape strips in the mouth of</p><p>nice they are changed so that they</p><p>do not express causing things like</p><p>congenital malformations to the same</p><p>thing happens during pregnancy if</p><p>you have a couple who are in discussions</p><p>frequently keeping with the mother</p><p>maintaining a high level of stress you</p><p>unfairly prejudice the system and</p><p>genetic silencing of genes</p><p>altered the bbi and bb so much need</p><p>of gene silencing right and you</p><p>would change the development of the baby</p><p>brain development you predict</p><p>we saw early in pregnancy you will</p><p>cause congenital malformations by</p><p>pure emotional stress so the mother</p><p>needs peace
