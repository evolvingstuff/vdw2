#### [Rancid Prenatal Omega-3 Supplements – It’s a Problem.](https://www.omega3innovations.com/blog/rancid-prenatal-omega-3-supplements-its-a-problem/)

* This is a supplier of Omega-3 which is not rancid (Omega3Innovations)

* “Studies from these nations  **have consistently found**  that the majority of omega-3 supplements sold at retail stores have exceeded international freshness standards long before their stated expiration dates”

* “For consumers, the best way to assess freshness is to taste and smell the supplement. If the oil smells or tastes fishy, it is rancid and should be thrown away”
