Objective: Compare the efficacy and safety of daily versus fortnightly oral vitamin D3 in treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children aged 1-10 years.

Design: Open labelled randomized controlled trial.

Patients: Eighty children with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency were randomized into group daily (D) and group bolus (B) <span>[40 in each group]</span> to receive oral vitamin D3, 4000 IU daily or 60,000 IU fortnightly for 12 weeks respectively. Both groups received daily oral calcium of 500 mg/day.

Measurements: Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, urine calcium: creatinine ratio and radiological score were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, 74 children were available for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of both regimens.

Results: Both regimens led to a significant increase in Ca and P levels and a fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no intergroup difference. At 4- and 12-week assessments, all children in both treatment arms achieved 25(OH)D level in sufficiency range, with no significant difference in their geometric mean. Both regimens were associated with asymptomatic transient hypercalcemia <span>[group D-51.4% vs. group B-34.3%; p -0.14]</span> and hypercalciuria (5.7%) in group D that resolved spontaneously on follow-up.

Conclusions: Daily and fortnightly oral vitamin D3 in similar cumulative doses are efficacious for treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children (1-10 years). Treated children should be monitored for serum 25(OH)D, Ca and urinary calcium creatinine ratio.
