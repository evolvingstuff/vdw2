#### Low Vitamin D increases Prostaglandins – 2015

 **Vitamin D and Pain: Vitamin D and Its Role in the Aetiology and Maintenance of Chronic Pain States and Associated Comorbidities**

The emergence of new data suggests that the benefits of Vitamin D extend beyond healthy bones. This paper looks at Vitamin D and its role in the aetiology and maintenance of chronic pain states and associated comorbidities. The interfaces between pain and Vitamin D and the mechanisms of action of Vitamin D on pain processes are explored. Finally the association between Vitamin D and pain comorbidities such as sleep and depression is investigated. The paper shows that Vitamin D exerts anatomic, hormonal, neurological, and immunological influences on pain manifestation, thereby playing a role in the aetiology and maintenance of chronic pain states and associated comorbidities. More research is necessary to determine whether Vitamin D is useful in the treatment of various pain conditions and whether or not the effect is limited to patients who are deficient in Vitamin D.

4.3.3. Vitamin D and Prostaglandins

Vitamin D influences prostaglandin action by inhibiting COX-2 expression and by stimulating 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) expression <sup>[102]</sup>. The enzyme 15-PGDH degrades prostaglandins and inhibits prostaglandin-E2 receptor (PGE2) subtypes and prostaglandin-F2 alpha receptor subtypes (Box 2) <sup>[102]</sup>. Prostaglandins have a direct effect on sensory neurones by lowering the firing threshold, increasing the number of action potentials elicited by a depolarizing stimulus, and enhancing SP and CGRP release <sup>[103]</sup>. Prostaglandins mediate neuropathic pain in the spinal cord via PGE2 depolarising wide dynamic range neurones <sup>[27]</sup>.

#### 2,000 IU of vitamin D reduced the prostaglandin cascade in Breast Cancer - 2013

BACKGROUND:

Preclinical studies suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D]</span> and celecoxib inhibit prostaglandins (PGs) associated with cancer through different mechanisms. We determined if there was synergy in their use.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

A total of 36 healthy women received daily for one month/menstrual cycle: placebo, 400 international units (IU) vitamin D-3, 2,000 IU vitamin D-3, or 2,000 IU vitamin D-3 plus 400 mg celecoxib. Serum and nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) were analyzed for PGE2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 and -2; serum for 25(OH)D (total, -D-2, -D-3), plasma for celecoxib; and mammary duct RNA for cyclooxygenase (COX)2.

RESULTS:

25(OH)D-3 increased (p<0.01) only in the groups receiving 2,000 IU vitamin D-3. PGE2 decreased in the breast (p=0.01) only after receiving 2,000 IU vitamin D-3; 2,000 IU vitamin D-3 alone was more effective in decreasing PGE2 than 2,000 IU vitamin D-3 plus celecoxib (p=0.018). COX2 expression decreased only in the breasts of women taking 2,000 IU vitamin D-3. Change in circulating 25(OH)D-3 correlated with change in TGFβ2 in the breast.

CONCLUSION: Vitamin D-3 reduces the PG cascade and increases TGFβ2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Adding celecoxib did not provide synergy.
