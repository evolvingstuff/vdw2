Background: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin levels and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic diarrhea.

Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study using information drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). To assess mortality outcomes, we compared our data with records from the National Death Index as of December 31, 2011. The NHANES data were used to determine mortality outcome. We used a Cox regression model-based approach to analyze the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin concentrations and mortality in chronic diarrhea patients.

Results: A total of 2,972 participants with chronic diarrhea were included in our study, 488 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. The study showed an L-shaped relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin concentrations and all-cause mortality with a threshold of 73.40 nmol/L. On the left side of the threshold, each 1-unit increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin concentrations was associated with a 2.2% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.978; 95% CI: 0.969, 0.987); however, on the right side of the threshold, there was no significant correlation between 25(OH)D concentrations and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels showed an L-shaped association with all-cause mortality in patients with chronic diarrhea, with 73.40 nmol/L as the potential threshold. However, because this was a cross-sectional study, only an association, not a causal relationship, can be inferred. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential impact of vitamin D supplementation on mortality outcomes.

Introduction Vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of childhood diarrhea. We aim to carry out a review and meta-analysis of the evidence relating vitamin D insufficiency to childhood diarrhea.

Methods We searched PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Cochrane Library (from inception to August 2022), then independently reviewed the eligibility, and read full-text reviews for selected articles. Keywords used were &#39;vitamin D, &#39;25-hydroxyvitamin D, &#39;vitamin D deficiency&#39;, &#39;diarrhea&#39;, &#39;gastroenteritis&#39;, &#39;children&#39;, and &#39;pediatric&#39; The search was limited to studies only in English and with available full-text. Year limitation was not applied in our search. Unpublished trials, dissertations, preliminary reports, conference abstracts, and repositories were excluded from the study. Newcastle­Ottawa Scale was used as the risk of bias assessment tool. Meta-analysis using the random-effects model was done. 

Results Out of 5,565 articles, 12 articles were included in our systematic review, however only 7 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant association between vitamin D deficiency and diarrhea in children in developing countries (OR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.80; p=0.01). On the secondary outcome, the association of vitamin D deficiency and duration or recurrences of diarrhea are conflicting.

Conclusions There is an association between vitamin D deficiency and the prevalence of diarrhea. Future studies should evaluate the causal association, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the severity of diarrhea, and whether vitamin D deficiency treatments affects the prevalence of diarrhea.

!!!! Death from Chronic Diarrhea 50% more likely if low Vitamin D - Jan 2025

Background: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin levels and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic diarrhea.

Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study using information drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). To assess mortality outcomes, we compared our data with records from the National Death Index as of December 31, 2011. The NHANES data were used to determine mortality outcome. We used a Cox regression model-based approach to analyze the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin concentrations and mortality in chronic diarrhea patients.

Results: A total of 2,972 participants with chronic diarrhea were included in our study, 488 cases of all-cause mortality were recorded. The study showed an L-shaped relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin concentrations and all-cause mortality with a threshold of 73.40 nmol/L. On the left side of the threshold, each 1-unit increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin concentrations was associated with a 2.2% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.978; 95% CI: 0.969, 0.987); however, on the right side of the threshold, there was no significant correlation between 25(OH)D concentrations and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels showed an L-shaped association with all-cause mortality in patients with chronic diarrhea, with 73.40 nmol/L as the potential threshold. However, because this was a cross-sectional study, only an association, not a causal relationship, can be inferred. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential impact of vitamin D supplementation on mortality outcomes.
