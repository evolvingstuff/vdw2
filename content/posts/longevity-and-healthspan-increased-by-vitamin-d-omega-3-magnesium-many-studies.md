#### Methylation of Vitamin D genes changes vitamin D getting to cells- Dec 2016

 **Relationship between methylation status of vitamin D-related genes, vitamin D levels, and methyl-donor biochemistry** 

Journal of Nutrition & Intermediary Metabolism Volume 6, December 2016, Pages 8-15 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnim.2016.04.010

Highlights

* Plasma 25(OH)D positively correlates with methylation status of the vitamin D receptor gene.

* Vitamin D status relates to the methylation status of the genes of key enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism.

* DNA methylation may influence vitamin D metabolism, possibly explaining varied responses to intake.

* Methyl-donor related biochemistry (serum folate, B12, plasma homocysteine) does not significantly alter these relationships.

Vitamin D is known for its role in the regulation of gene expression via the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear transcription factor. More recently, a role for vitamin D in regulating DNA methylation has been identified as an additional mechanism of modulation of gene expression. How methylation status influences vitamin D metabolism and response pathways is not yet clear. 

Therefore, we aimed to assess the relationship between plasma 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D) and the methylation status of 

* vitamin D metabolism enzyme genes (CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1) and the 

* vitamin D receptor gene (VDR). 

This analysis was conducted in the context of dietary vitamin D, and background methyl donor related biochemistry, with adjustment for several dietary and lifestyle variables. Percentage methylation at CpG sites was assessed in peripheral blood cells using methylation sensitive and dependent enzymes and qPCR. Standard analytical techniques were used to determine plasma 25(OH)D and homocysteine, and serum folate and B12, with the relationship to methylation status assessed using multi-variable regression analysis. CYP2R1 and VDR methylation were found to be independent predictors of plasma 25(OH)D, when adjusted for vitamin D intake and other lifestyle variables. CYP24A1 was related to plasma 25(OH)D directly, but not in the context of vitamin D intake. Methyl-group donor biochemistry was associated with the methylation status of some genes, but did not alter the relationship between methylation and plasma 25(OH)D. 

Modulation of methylation status of CYP2R1, CYP24A1 and VDR in response to plasma 25(OH)D may be part of feedback loops involved in maintaining vitamin D homeostasis, and may explain a portion of the variance in plasma 25(OH)D levels in response to intake and sun exposure. Methyl-group donor biochemistry, while a potential independent modulator, did not alter this effect.

#### Vitamin D supplementation is associated 2 year slower epigenetic aging - May 2022

GeroScience volume 44, pages 1847–1859 (2022)

Adverse effects of low vitamin D level on mortality and morbidity are controversially discussed. 

Especially older people are at risk for vitamin D deficiency and therefore exposed to its potentially harmful consequences. 

A way of measuring differences in the biological age is through  **DNA methylation age (DNAm age)**  and its deviation from chronological age, DNAm age acceleration (DNAmAA).

We previously reported on an association between vitamin D deficiency and higher 7-CpG DNAmAA in participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). In this study, we employ a quasi-interventional study design to assess the relationship between DNAmAA of five epigenetic clocks and vitamin D supplementation. 

Longitudinal data were available for 1,036 participants of BASE-II that were reexamined on average 7.4 years later in the GendAge study (mean age at follow-up: 75.6 years, SD = 3.8 years, age range: 64.9–94.1 years, 51.9% female). 

DNAmAA was estimated with the 

* 7-CpG clock,

* Horvath’s clock, 

* Hannum’s clock, 

* PhenoAge, and 

* GrimAge. 

Methylation data were obtained through methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE) or Illumina’s Infinium “MethylationEPIC” array. Vitamin D–deficient participants who chose to start vitamin D supplementation after baseline examination showed a 

* 2.6-year lower 7-CpG DNAmAA (p = 0.011) and 

* 1.3-year lower Horvath DNAmAA (p = 0.042) 

compared to untreated and vitamin D–deficient participants.

DNAmAA did not statistically differ between participants with successfully treated vitamin D deficiency and healthy controls (p > 0.16).

Therefore, we conclude that intake of vitamin D supplement is associated with lower DNAmAA in participants with vitamin D deficiency.

#### A Review: Highlighting the Links between Epigenetics, COVID-19 Infection, and Vitamin D - Oct 2022

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23(20), 12292; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232012292

by Ashmika Foolch etc.

The highly transmittable and infectious COVID-19 remains a major threat worldwide, with the elderly and comorbid individuals being the most vulnerable. While vaccines are currently available, therapeutic drugs will help ease the viral outbreak and prevent serious health outcomes. Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression through changes in chromatin structure and have been linked to viral pathophysiology. Since epigenetic modifications contribute to the life cycle of the virus and host immune responses to infection, epigenetic drugs are promising treatment targets to ameliorate COVID-19. Deficiency of the multifunctional secosteroid hormone vitamin D is a global health threat. Vitamin D and its receptor function to regulate genes involved in immunity, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. Amassed evidence also indicates the biological relations of vitamin D with reduced disease risk, while its receptor can be modulated by epigenetic mechanisms. The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D suggest a role for vitamin D as a COVID-19 therapeutic agent. Therefore, this review highlights the epigenetic effects on COVID-19 and vitamin D while also proposing a role for vitamin D in COVID-19 infections.
