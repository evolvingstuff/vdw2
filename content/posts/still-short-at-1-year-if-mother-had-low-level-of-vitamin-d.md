Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy has been linked to fetal growth and may also impact child growth in infancy. We used data and blood samples from the 12-site U.S. Collaborative Perinatal Project  **(1959-65)**  to examine the association of maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and infant anthropometry across the first year of life in singletons (n=2473 mother-child pairs). Maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured at ≤26 weeks gestation using chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Infant anthropometry was expressed as z-scores for  **length (LAZ), head circumference (HC-Z)** , weight (WAZ), and BMI (BMI-Z) based on measures at birth and 4, 8 and 12 months of age. We controlled for study site, and important infant and maternal characteristics in linear mixed effects models. 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L (conventional definition of deficiency) vs. 蠅30 nmol/L was associated with LAZ and HC-Z measures that were 0.13 (95% CI: 0.03-0.23) and 0.20 (95% CI: 0.11-0.28) lower, respectively, across the first year of life. Differences observed by 25(OH)D in WAZ and BMI-Z at birth resolved by 4 months of age, potentially reflecting catch-up growth. These findings suggest that maternal vitamin D deficiency has a sustained association with markers of linear or skeletal growth during the first year of life, while initial associations with measures of weight and body composition may resolve.
