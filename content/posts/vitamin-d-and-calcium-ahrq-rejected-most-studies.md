#### REJECTION

They rejected studies using Vitamin D injections

They rejected studies using Vitamin D topically

They rejected studies using Vitamin D sublingually

They rejected studies using Vitamin D loading dose

They rejected studies using Vitamin D during pregnancy other than weight

They rejected studies using Vitamin D for infants - other than birth weight and length

They rejected studies using Vitamin D with cofactor such as Omega-3, Magnesium, etc (other than Calcium)

They rejected studies using Vitamin D  which "showed effects only in those with lower serum 25(OH)D"

They rejected studies using Vitamin D   for which there was no control group 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; example, rejected Turkish study where which EVERY infant got vitamin D ==> 60X reduction in rickets

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some doctors gave all patients vitamin D (because it was morally irresponsible to not do so)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple Sclerosis was CURED in 90% of the patients (no control group)

They rejected studies using Vitamin D if they conflicted

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- - previous studies often used far less vitamin D than recent studies

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AHRQ rejects the possibility that 4000 IU can have far more benefit than 400 IU

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most people, but not AHRQ, will expect different results if add 20 ng to a baseline of 20 ng than same to a 40 ng baseline

They failed to reject studies which used more than 400 mg of Calcium along with Vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- > 400 mg is too much Calcium when there is an adequate amount of vitamin D

The few of the studies which were accepted were all published before April 2013

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There have been a huge number of great studies since then.
