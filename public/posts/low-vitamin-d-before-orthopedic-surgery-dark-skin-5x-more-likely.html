Vitamin D is essential for bone healing and muscle function and is critical for a patient&rsquo;s recovery. The study appears in the October issue of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (see below)</p><p>&ldquo;In the perfect world, test levels, fix and then operate,&rdquo; said Joseph Lane, M.D., professor of Orthopedic Surgery and chief of the Metabolic Bone Disease Service at HSS, who led the study. &ldquo;If you put people on 2,000-4,000 IU of vitamin D based on what their deficient value was, you can usually get them <strong>corrected in four to six weeks,</strong> which is when you are really going to need the vitamin D. If you are really aggressive right before surgery, you can correct deficient levels quickly, but you have to correct it, measure it, and then act on it.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr. Lane, bone remodeling or bone tissue formation, a part of the healing process, occurs about t <strong>wo to four weeks after surgery</strong> .</p><p><strong>This is the critical stage when your body needs vitamin D.</strong></p><p>For their study, investigators conducted a retrospective chart review of 723 patients who were scheduled for orthopedic surgery between January 2007 and March 2008 at HSS. They examined the vitamin D levels, which had been measured in all patients before their surgery, and found that 43 percent had insufficient vitamin D and 40 percent had deficient levels.</p><p>Vitamin D inadequacy was defined as &lt;32 ng/mL, vitamin D insufficiency was defined as 20 to &lt;32 ng/mL, and vitamin D deficiency was defined at &lt;20 ng/mL. Problems were more prevalent in younger patients, men and individuals with dark skin-blacks and Hispanic.</p><p>The highest levels of deficiency were seen in patients in the trauma service, where 66 percent of patients had insufficient levels and 52 percent had deficient levels. Of the patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery, 34 percent had inadequate levels and of patients undergoing hand surgery, 40 percent had insufficient levels.</p><p>In the Sports Medicine Service, 52.3 percent had insufficient levels and of these, one-third of these or 17 percent of the total had deficient levels. &ldquo;We frequently see stress fractures in the Sports Medicine Service and if you want to heal, you have to fix the calcium and vitamin D,&rdquo; Dr. Lane said.</p><p>In the Arthroplasty Service, which conducts hip and knee replacements, 38 percent had inadequate levels and 48 percent had deficient levels. &ldquo;With arthroplasty, there is a certain number of patients that when you put in the prothesis, it breaks the bone adjacent to the protheses, which can really debilitate patients.&rdquo; This could be prevented or minimized by rectifying vitamin D levels. Dr. Lane also explained that they now perform procedures where they grow a bone into a prosthesis without using cement. &ldquo;In those people, it would be an advantage to have adequate vitamin D, because it matures the bone as it grows in, it is really healing into the prosthesis,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;The take home message is that low vitamin D has an implication in terms of muscle and fracture healing, it occurs in about 50 percent of people coming in for orthopedic surgery, and it is eminently correctable,&rdquo; Dr. Lane said. &ldquo;We recommend that people undergoing a procedure that involves the bone or the muscle should correct their vitamin D if they want to have an earlier faster, better, result. What we are saying is &lsquo;wake up guys, smell the coffee; half of your patients have a problem, measure it, and if they are low, then fix it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>In recent years, vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a common phenomenon and is caused by many factors. It is difficult to get from foods, except, for example, cod liver oil and fish. Until recently, the recommended daily allowance was set too low so foods were not supplemented with adequate doses. And third, while people can absorb vitamin D from sunlight, people these days often work long hours and often use sunscreen that impedes vitamin D intake.</p><p>The study was funded, in part, by the Charles Cohn Foundation of Rockville Centre, N.Y.</p><p>Other authors of the study, all from Hospital of Special Surgery, are Ljiljana Bogunovic, M.D., Abraham D.

An alarmingly high rate of vitamin-D deficiency in the general population has been reported recently. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the extent of low serum levels of vitamin D among orthopaedic surgery patients.</p><p>Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of 723 patients who were scheduled for orthopaedic surgery between January 2007 and March 2008. Preoperative serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were measured. The prevalence of normal (?32 ng/mL), insufficient (&lt;32 ng/mL), and deficient (&lt;20 ng/mL) vitamin-D levels was determined. Logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for insufficient (&lt;32 ng/mL) 25(OH)D levels.</p><p>Results Overall, 43% of all patients had insufficient serum vitamin-D levels, and, of these, 40% had deficient levels. Among the orthopaedic services, the highest rates of low serum vitamin-D levels were seen in the trauma and sports services, in which the rates of abnormal (insufficient and deficient) vitamin-D levels were 66% and 52%, respectively. The lowest rate of abnormal vitamin-D levels was seen in the metabolic bone disease service. Patients between the ages of fifty-one and seventy years were 35% less likely to have low vitamin-D levels than patients between the ages of eighteen and fifty years (p = 0.018) (Comment – this seems the reverse of what others report). The prevalence of low vitamin-D levels was significantly higher in men (p = 0.006).</p><p>Individuals with <strong>darker skin tones (blacks and Hispanics) were 5.5 times more likely</strong> to have low vitamin-D levels when compared with those with lighter skin tones (whites and Asians) (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusions The prevalence of low serum levels of vitamin D among patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery is very common.</p><p>Given the importance of vitamin D in musculoskeletal health, such low levels may negatively impact patient outcomes.</p><hr><h2 id=pdf-is-available-at-bottom-of-this-page>PDF is available at bottom of this page</h2><h1 id=see-also-vitamindwiki>See also VitaminDWiki</h1><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/hmos-will-save-millions-of-dollars-with-vitamin-d>HMOs will save millions of dollars with vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=87&amp;sort_mode=created_desc">All items in Cost Savings</a> 18 items as of Oct 2011</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=64&amp;sort_mode=created_desc">All items in After Surgery or Trauma</a> 47 items as of Nov 2011</p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/should-stock-up-on-vitamin-d-if-having-surgery-due-to-fragile-bones>Should stock-up on vitamin D if having surgery due to fragile bones – Jan 2011</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/hardly-any-children-had-enough-vitamin-d-before-bone-surgery>Hardly any children had enough vitamin D before bone surgery – April 2011</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/tags/osteoporosis-medication-7x-better-when-more-than-33-ng-of-vitamin-d-june-2011.html>Osteoporosis medication 7X better when more than 33 ng of vitamin D – June 2011</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/is-it-ethical-to-not-give-vitamin-d-in-osteoporosis-trials-nejm>Is it ethical to not give vitamin D in osteoporosis trials– NEJM Sept 2010</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/tags/calcium-and-vitamin-d-after-hip-fracture-reduced-death-rate-by-25-feb-2011.html>Calcium and vitamin D after hip fracture reduced death rate by 25% – Feb 2011</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/overview-dark-skin-and-vitamin-d>Overview Dark Skin and Vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/overview-osteoporosis-and-vitamin-d>Overview Osteoporosis and Vitamin D</a></p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
