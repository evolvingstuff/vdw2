<img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/vdr-tbi.jpg alt=image width=600><p>Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is associated with neuroinflammation and neurocognitive deficits in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of VD and the molecular mechanisms after TBI. After the intraperitoneal injection of VD (1 µg/kg), sensorimotor and cognitive function was assessed via a series of behavioral tests in TBI rats. Traumatic outcomes were investigated by brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and morphologic staining. In vitro, cellular viability and cytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons were detected via the MTT method and LDH release. Hippocampal oxidative stress-related enzymes and proinflammatory mediators and the serum concentration of VD were analyzed by ELISA. The expression of VDR, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κ B p65 was measured by Western blot. Furthermore, the levels of M1/M2 microglial markers were quantified using real-time PCR and Western blot. VD treatment significantly increased the serum level of VD and the hippocampal expression of VDR.</p><p>VD not only effectively alleviated neurocognitive deficits, brain edema, and BBB disruption but also promoted hippocampal neuronal survival in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, VD therapy prevented excessive neuroinflammation and oxidative stress caused by TBI. Mechanically, the hippocampal expression of TLR4, MyD88, and nuclear NF-κ B p65 was elevated in the TBI group but robustly restrained by VD treatment. Taken together, VD provides an important neuroprotection through modulating hippocampal microglial M2 polarization and neuroinflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B pathway.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/how-treat-tbi-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=13-of-those-average-age-75-recently-had-a-tbi---april-2024>13% of those average age 75 recently had a TBI - April 2024</h4><p><strong>Incidence of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Longitudinal Cohort of Older Adults</strong></p><p>JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(5):e2414223. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.14223</p><p>Erica Kornblith, PhD1,2; L.

Analyses were completed August 9 through December 12, 2022. Participants were 65 years of age or older in the HRS with survey data linked to Medicare without a TBI prior to HRS enrollment. They were community-dwelling at enrollment but were retained in HRS if they were later institutionalized.</p><p>Exposures Baseline demographic, cognitive, medical, and SDOH information from HRS.</p><p>Main Outcomes and Measures Incident TBI was defined using inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes received the same day or within 1 day as the emergency department (ED) visit code and the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) code, after baseline HRS interview. A cohort with TBI codes but no ED visit or CT or MRI scan was derived to capture diagnoses in nonhospital settings. Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations of TBI with demographic and SDOH characteristics used sample weights. Fine-Gray regression models estimated associations between covariates and TBI, with death as a competing risk. Imputation considering outcome and complex survey design was performed by race and ethnicity, sex, education level, and Area Deprivation Index percentiles 1, 50, and 100. Other exposure variables were fixed at their weighted means.</p><p>Results Among 9239 eligible respondents, 5258 (57.7%) were female and 1210 (9.1%) were Black, 574 (4.7%) were Hispanic, and 7297 (84.4%) were White. Mean (SD) baseline age was 75.2 (8.0) years. During follow-up (18 years), 797 (8.9%) of respondents received an incident TBI diagnosis with an ED visit and a CT code within 1 day, 964 (10.2%) received an incident TBI diagnosis and an ED code, and 1148 (12.9%) received a TBI code with or without an ED visit and CT scan code.</p><p>Compared with respondents without incident TBI, respondents with TBI were</p><ul><li><p>more likely to be female (absolute difference, 7.0 <span>[95% CI, 3.3-10.8]</span>; P &lt; .001) and</p></li><li><p>White (absolute difference, 5.1 <span>[95% CI, 2.8-7.4]</span>; P &lt; .001),</p></li><li><p>have normal cognition (vs cognitive impairment or dementia; absolute difference, 6.1 <span>[95% CI, 2.8-9.3]</span>; P = .001),</p></li><li><p>higher education (absolute difference, 3.8 <span>[95% CI, 0.9-6.7]</span>; P &lt; .001), and</p></li><li><p>wealth (absolute difference, 6.5 <span>[95% CI, 2.3-10.7]</span>; P = .01), and</p></li><li><p>be without baseline lung disease (absolute difference, 5.1 <span>[95% CI, 3.0-7.2]</span>; P &lt; .001)</p></li><li><p>(n)or functional impairment (absolute difference, 3.3 <span>[95% CI, 0.4-6.1]</span>; P = .03).</p></li></ul><p>In adjusted multivariate models, lower education (subdistribution hazard ratio <span>[SHR]</span>, 0.73 <span>[95% CI, 0.57-0.94]</span>; P = .01), Black race (SHR, 0.61 <span>[95% CI, 0.46-0.80]</span>; P &lt; .001), area deprivation index national rank (SHR 1.00 <span>[95% CI 0.99-1.00]</span>; P = .009), and male sex (SHR, 0.73 <span>[95% CI, 0.56-0.94]</span>; P = .02) were associated with membership in the group without TBI. Sensitivity analyses using a broader definition of TBI yielded similar results.</p><p>Conclusions and Relevance In this longitudinal cohort study of older adults, almost 13% experienced incident TBI during the 18-year study period. For older adults who seek care for TBI, race and ethnicity, sex, and SDOH factors may be associated with incidence of TBI, seeking medical attention for TBI in older adulthood, or both.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/tbi-seniors.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>The word VITAMIN does not occur once in the PDF</strong></p><hr><h4 id=tbi-while-in-icu-a-single-dose-of-120000-iu-helped-a-lot---rct-march-2020>TBI while in ICU: a single dose of 120,000 IU helped a lot - RCT March 2020</h4><ul><li>Neuroprotective Role of Oral Vitamin D Supplementation on Consciousness and Inflammatory Biomarkers in Determining Severity Outcome in Acute Traumatic Brain Injury Patients: A Double-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial</li></ul><ul><li><a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-020-00896-5>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-020-00896-5</a> <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vit-d-tbi-rct-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a></li></ul><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/tbi-rct.jpg alt=image width=600><p>GCS = Glasgow outcome scale</p><p>GOSE = Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended</p><hr><h4 id=16400-google-scholar-hits-for-the-search-of-traumatic-brain-injury-vitamin-d-or-omega-3>16,400 Google Scholar hits for the search of &ldquo;Traumatic brain injury&rdquo; (&ldquo;Vitamin D&rdquo; OR Omega-3)</h4><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=%22Traumatic+brain+injury%22+%28%22Vitamin+D%22+OR+Omega-3%29&amp;btnG=%20%20">Google Scholar</a></strong> March 2025</p><ul><li><p>Investigating the Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D3 Administration on Inflammatory Biomarkers in Patients with Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Randomized Clinical Trial Oct 2024 <a href=https://doi.org/10.30476/ijms.2023.99465.3156>FREE PDF</a> <strong>300,000 IU injection helped</strong></p></li><li><p>Mitigating Traumatic Brain Injury: A Narrative Review of Supplementation and <strong>Dietary Protocols</strong> - July 2024, <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16152430>FREE PDF</a> - creatine monohydrate, omega-3 fatty acids, BCAAs, riboflavin, choline, magnesium, berry anthocyanins, Boswellia serrata, enzogenol, N-Acetylcysteine and melatonin.</p></li><li><p>The role of omega-3 fatty acids in sports nutrition: an overview Jan 2026 <a href=https://doi.org/10.23736/S0025-7826.25.04523-5>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids alleviate early brain injury after traumatic brain injury by inhibiting neuroinflammation and necroptosis - March 2023 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1515/tnsci-2022-0277>https://doi.org/10.1515/tnsci-2022-0277</a> FREE PDF</p></li><li><p>Optimal vitamin D level ameliorates neurological outcome and quality of life after traumatic brain injury: a clinical perspective - Sep 2021 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1924706>https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1924706</a> Behind paywall</p></li><li><p>The More, the Better: High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids Improve Behavioural and Molecular Outcomes in Preclinical Models in Mild Brain Injury - July 2021 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-021-01132-z>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-021-01132-z</a> FREE PDF</p></li><li><p>Chapter 10 - Vitamin D level and the outcome after traumatic brain injury - 2023 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-89835-5.00009-0>https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-89835-5.00009-0</a> PDF is behind a paywall</p><ul><li>Paucity of vitamin D significantly affects the consequences of a brain injury. Deficiency of vitamin D along with traumatic brain injury (TBI) elevates the risk of severity of the injury. This possibly affects the therapeutic regimen prescribed for TBI which may have a negative effect on its outcome. Pre-clinical trials suggested that the levels of vitamin D influence the recovery and outcome after a TBI. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to cause more deterioration in patients with severe TBI than in the ones with mild TBI. This clearly validates the necessity of screening the levels of vitamin D in neural deficit in order to reduce the risk of morbidity, neurocognitive disorders, osteomalacia, and cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in TBI and how it affects the recovery and subsequent quality of life of the patient.</li></ul></li><li><p>The Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Recovery from Traumatic Brain Injury - Dec 2019 <a href=https://digitalcommons.bridgewater.edu/honors_projects/1/>PHD Dissertation</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=vitamindwiki-founder-has-kept-emergency-vitamin-d-in-all-of-his-vehicles-since-2017>VitaminDWiki founder has kept emergency vitamin D in all of his vehicles since 2017</h4><hr><h4 id=tbi---7x--more-substance-abuse-in-us-soldiers---aug-2023>TBI ==> 7X more Substance Abuse in US Soldiers - Aug 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/264660/depression/tbi-tied-increased-mental-health-diagnoses-time-suicide?ecd=WNL_EVE_230812_mdedge">MDEdge</a></strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;But the sharpest difference was the increase in substance use disorder among those with TBI, which rose 100% compared with a 14.5% increase in soldiers with no history of TBI.&rdquo;</li></ul><hr><h4 id=the-standard-advice-for-concussions-is-wrong-therapy-does-actually-help---oct-2023>The Standard Advice for Concussions Is Wrong (therapy does actually help) - Oct 2023</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/10/concussion-brain-injury-treatment-recovery/675554/>6 month to recover after falling off of a horse, The Atlantic</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;The statistic of 3.8 million Americans a year gets bandied about, sometimes linked to mild head injuries from sports and other times to brain injuries of all kinds.
