In Denmark, subgroups at risk for low vitamin D levels, including neonates and toddlers, are recommended to use supplementation. The aim was to study the level of vitamin D3 among neonates born after in vitro ferti­lization compared with neonates from the general population.</p><p>Material and methods: In this cohort study a random sample of 1326 neonates repre­senting the general population and 1200 neonates conceived by in vitro fertilization born in Denmark from 1995 to 2002 were identified from registries covering the whole Danish population. Information on use of assisted reproduction was collected from the Danish In Vitro Fertilization register, ICD-10 code: DZ358F. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was measured from dried blood spots routinely collected by heel prick 48-72h after birth and corrected according to the hematocrit fraction for capillary blood of neonates. Linear regression analysis was performed, both crude and adjusted, for pre­defined putative confounders, identified through directed acyclic graphs.</p><p>Results: Vitamin D3 analysis could be performed from a total of 1105 neonates from the general population and 1072 neonates conceived by in vitro fertilization that were subsequently included in the study. The median vitamin D3 was 24.0 nmol/L (interquar­tile range <span>[IQR]</span> 14.1-39.3) and 33.0nmol/L (IQR 21.3-48.8) among neonates from the general population and neonates conceived by in vitro fertilization, respectively. The adjusted mean difference between neonates from the general population and those conceived by in vitro fertilization was <strong>6.1 nmol/L</strong> (95% confidence interval 4.1–8.1)</p><p>Conclusions: In this study, children born after in vitro fertilization have a higher vitamin D3 than a random sample of neonates in Denmark.1</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/newborn-vitamin-d-much-higher-if-ivf-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=note-vitamin-d-is-often-given-both-before-and-during-ivf-treatment>Note: Vitamin D is often given both before and during IVF treatment</h5><p><strong>I suspect that many of the women (who could afford IVF in the first place) also continue on with the Vitamin D during pregnancy</strong></p><hr><h5 id=note-ivf-facilities-would-probably-lose-business-if-they-mentioned-the-huge-fertility-benefit-of-vitamin-d>Note: IVF facilities would probably lose business if they mentioned the huge fertility benefit of Vitamin D</h5><p><strong><a href=/posts/in-vitro-fertilization-costs-at-least-10000-dollars-vitamin-d-costs-5-dollars style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: In-vitro Fertilization costs at least 10,000 dollars, Vitamin D costs 5 dollars">In-vitro Fertilization costs at least 10,000 dollars, Vitamin D costs 5 dollars</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=ivf-success-rates-greatly-increased-if-added-both-vitamin-d-and-vaginal-probiotics---rct-feb-2025>IVF success rates greatly increased if added both Vitamin D and Vaginal Probiotics - RCT Feb 2025</h4><p><strong>The effect of vitamin D supplementation and vaginal probiotics on fertility in women with recurrent implantation failure: A randomized clinical trial</strong></p><p>Hum Immunol . 2025 Feb 15;86(3):111259. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2025.111259>doi: 10.1016/j.humimm.2025.111259</a> <strong>Vitamin D dose is behind a $28 paywall</strong></p><p>Elham Badihi 1, Parisa Sharifi 2, Amir Moradi 3, Amin Kamrani 4, Ali Hassanzadeh 5, Mohammad Sadegh Soltani-Zangbar 4, Sara Parsania 1, Farshid Afandideh 1, Javad Ahmadian Heris 6, Shahla Danaii 7, Behnam Shahriar 1, Mehrin Sadough 1, Forough Chakari-Khiavi 1, Shirin Teymouri Nobari 8, Leili Aghebati-Maleki 1, Mehdi Yousefi 9</p><p>Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a significant obstacle in assisted reproductive technology, affecting approximately 10 % of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Emerging evidence suggests that vaginal probiotics and vitamin D supplementation may improve reproductive outcomes. This randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of these interventions on fertility in women with RIF and thin endometrium (&lt;6 mm). A total of 112 women with a history of RIF were randomized into four groups: vaginal probiotics, vitamin D supplementation, a combination of both, or standard IVF treatment (control). The primary outcome was the pregnancy rate, confirmed by β-hCG testing and ultrasound. Secondary outcomes included changes in Th1/Th2 ratio, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and cytokine profiles.</p><ul><li><p>The <strong>combination group</strong> demonstrated the highest pregnancy rate (46.4 %), which was significantly higher compared with the</p></li><li><p>probiotics (14.2 %), p = 0.008),</p></li><li><p>vitamin D (17.8 %), p = 0.002), and control groups (10.7 %), p = 0.003).</p></li></ul><p>Only the combination therapy significantly reduced the Th1/Th2 ratio (p &lt; 0.001) and NK cell activity (p &lt; 0.001), while significantly increasing IL-4 and TGF-β and decreasing IFN-γ levels (all p &lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that combined vaginal probiotics and vitamin D supplementation may improve pregnancy outcomes by modulating the immune responses in women with RIF. This dual intervention may represent a promising strategy for enhancing fertility in this population of RIF patients.</p><hr><h4 id=fertility-improved-the-most-if-give-vitamin-d-and-1-or-more-vitamin-d-receptor-activators>Fertility improved the most if give Vitamin D AND 1 or more Vitamin D Receptor Activators</h4><p><strong>For male and female before pregnancy</strong></p><p>Perhaps 50,000 IU bi-weekly for several months before becoming pregnant</p><p>Daily supplement to activate the Vitamin D Receptor</p><p><strong>Female to continue with both D and activator thru 6 months after birth</strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382334"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382334",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382334"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382334"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382334"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382334"></script></body></html>
