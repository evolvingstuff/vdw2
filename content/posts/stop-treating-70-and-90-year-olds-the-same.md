 **Vaccinations** 

* “There are 17 subgroupings for children from birth through age 18.”

* “But all Americans 65 and older — including the two fastest-growing segments of our population, the 80- to 90-year-olds and those over 100 — are lumped in a single group, as if bodies and behaviors don’t change over the last half-century of life.”

* “Older adults who receive tetanus and diphtheria vaccines, for instance, produce less-effective antibodies, and the vaccines’ protective effect fades faster than it does for younger patients.”

* “There may also come a point toward the end of many lives when vaccination no longer makes sense. Although the C.D.C. recommends that everyone receive an annual flu vaccine, the benefits for the very old and ill are unproven, and for them the shot may produce only pain and inconvenience”

 **Urological conditions** 

* “Studies have shown that procedures used to treat common urological conditions not only had no efficacy in frail older men but also caused permanent functional decline and death.”

 **Chemotherapy** 

* “And changes in the kidneys, heart, skin and other organs steadily decrease older people’s ability to tolerate chemotherapy and radiation.”
