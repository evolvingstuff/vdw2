&lt;p>The difference between Intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH) and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) primarily lies in the specific forms of the hormone that each assay measures and their clinical utility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The iPTH assay measures the level of 1-84 PTH, which is the full, active form of the hormone, along with large truncated fragments of non-1-84 PTH, including 7-84 PTH. This assay is widely used, especially in the context of managing patients with chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis, to assess parathyroid function and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The iPTH assay is considered the standard measurement for PTH in clinical practice and is used for approximately 90% of Japanese dialysis patients 1.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
