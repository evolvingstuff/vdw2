* “One-year-old Dataeo Scully died at Walsall Manor Hospital in March. An investigation carried revealed the cause of death was a lack of Vitamin D.”

* “They told me it is not protocol to check Vitamin D but it is important and there is not much out there about it. I want to raise awareness by telling Dataeo’s story.”

 **[UK Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6410465/Heartbroken-mother-launches-legal-action-against-hospital-son-dies-Vitamin-D-deficiency.html)** 

* "'If a doctor had not thought outside the box and not checked his Vitamin D levels, it would say Sudden Infant Death Syndrome on his death certificate."

* "Ms Scully also believes that because of Dataeo's darker skin colour, it was harder for him to produce vitamin D because the pigment in dark skin doesn't absorb as much UV radiation as compared to lighter skinned people."

I expect that medical liability costs in a few years will outweigh any cost savings

 **Note: It is far less expensive to just give vitamin D to those who might need it than to test**
