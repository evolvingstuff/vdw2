#### Thyroid hormones decrease plasma 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels through transcriptional repression of the renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1α-hydroxylase gene (CYP27B1).

Endocrinology. 2013 Feb;154(2):609-22. [doi: 10.1210/en.2012-1647.](https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2012-1647.)

The primary determinant of circulating 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25<span>[OH]</span>(2)D) levels is the activity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 27B1 <span>[CYP27B1]</span>) in the kidney. 

Hyperthyroid patients have been reported to have low levels of plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D. 

However, the detailed mechanism of thyroid hormone action on vitamin D metabolism is still poorly understood. 

The present study determined whether renal CYP27B1 gene expression was negatively regulated by thyroid hormones. 

T(3)-induced hyperthyroid mice showed marked decreases in plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D levels and in renal expression of CYP27B1 mRNA but no changes in plasma concentrations of calcium, PTH, or fibroblast growth factor-23. In addition, we observed that T(3) administration significantly decreased plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D and renal CYP27B1 mRNA levels that were increased by low-calcium or low-phosphorus diets and induced hypocalcemia in mice fed a low-calcium diet. Promoter analysis revealed that T(3) decreases the basal transcriptional activity of the CYP27B1 gene through thyroid hormone receptors (TRα and TRβ1) and the retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) in renal proximal tubular cells. Interestingly, we identified an everted repeat negative thyroid hormone response element (1α-nTRE) overlapping the sterol regulatory element (1α-SRE) and the TATA-box -50 to -20 base pairs from the human CYP27B1 gene transcription start site. 

Finally, we established that CYP27B1 gene transcription is positively regulated by SRE-binding proteins and that a T(3)-bound TRβ1/RXRα heterodimer inhibits SRE-binding protein-1c-induced transcriptional activity through the 1α-nTRE. 

These results suggest that transcriptional repression of the CYP27B1 gene by T(3)-bound TRs/RXRα, acting through the 1α-nTRE, results in decreased renal CYP27B1 expression and plasma 1,25(OH)(2)D levels.
