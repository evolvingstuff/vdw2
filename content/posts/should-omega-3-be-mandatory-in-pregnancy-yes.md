Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are essential fatty acids for the human body. Seafood and microalgae are the most important sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Supplementation with 200 mg/day of DHA during pregnancy and breastfeeding has been suggested for women and infants in countries with low seafood consumption. Maternal concentration of DHA and EPA was associated with concentration in cord blood and breast milk. High concentrations of DHA and EPA were identified at the level of retinal photoreceptors and neuronal cell membranes. It was observed that supplementation with DHA and EPA during pregnancy had beneficial effects on the neurological development of the fetus and infant by improving language, memory, attention, and hand coordination, affecting sleep patterns, and improving visual acuity. Beneficial effects on the development of the infant were also associated with the maternal intake of omega-3 fatty acids during breastfeeding. Supplementation with DHA and EPA may reduce the risk of preterm birth but also of preeclampsia in low-risk pregnancies. Women of childbearing age should have an intake of 250 mg/day of DHA + EPA from their diet or supplements. To reduce the risk of premature birth, pregnant women must additionally receive at least 100–200 mg of DHA every day. It is recommended that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids starts before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Beneficial effects on the mother have been identified, such as the reduction of postpartum depression symptoms, the decrease of cardiovascular risk, and the anti-inflammatory role.
