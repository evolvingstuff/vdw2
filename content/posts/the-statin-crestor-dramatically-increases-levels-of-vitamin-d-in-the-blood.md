### Does rosuvastatin increase serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D?

Dermatoendocrinol. 2012 Jan 1;4(1):2-7.

An observational study and a "clinical trial" seem to prove that rosuvastatin (but not fluvastatin) dramatically increases serum levels of 25-(OH)-D3  **(three-fold above starting values)** . A critical analysis of the two publications, presented below, raises serious concerns. Conclusions from these two studies have already been drawn in the scientific literature.It is argued that claiming or believing in a "novel pleiotropic effect of rosuvastatin" may be misleading and premature.
