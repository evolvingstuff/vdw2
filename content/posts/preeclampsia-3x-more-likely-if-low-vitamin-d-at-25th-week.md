Objective?  Whether vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is a cause of pre-eclampsia remains controversial. Most previous studies to date have assessed exposure at only one time-point in pregnancy. We assessed longitudinal vitamin D status during pregnancy and the risk of pre-eclampsia.

Design?  Prospective cohort study.

Setting?  Seventeen urban obstetric hospitals, Canada.

Population?  Pregnant women who were participants in a trial of vitamin C and E supplementation for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. Canadian participants who consented to participate in a biobank with plasma specimens available at the baseline visit were included (n = 697).

Methods?  Maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were measured at 12–18 and 24–26 weeks of gestation using chemiluminescence immunoassay.

Main outcome measures?  Pre-eclampsia.

Results?  Of the women, 39% were vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D <50 nmol/l). A strong positive correlation was observed in maternal 25(OH)D concentrations between the two gestational age windows (r = 0.69, P < 0.0001). 

Mean maternal 25(OH)D concentrations at 24–26 weeks of gestation were significantly lower in women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia compared with those who did not (mean ± SD: 48.9 ± 16.8 versus 57.0 ± 19.1 nmol/l, P = 0.03). 

Women with 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l at 24–26 weeks gestation experienced an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (adjusted odds ratio  **3.24** , 95% confidence interval 1.37–7.69), whereas the association was not statistically significant for maternal 25(OH)D level at 12–18 weeks of gestation.

Conclusions?  Lower maternal 25(OH)D levels at late mid-trimester were associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia.
