#### Vitamin D in pituitary driven osteopathies

Pituitary [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-024-01439-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-024-01439-3)

The evidence that pituitary hormones may bypass peripheral endocrine glands to exert remarkable effects on the skeleton is gaining ground. Both hormonal excess and deficit may determine impairment in bone structure, and they commonly result in bone loss in patients affected by pituitary and neuroendocrine disorders. Vertebral fractures are the most common skeletal alterations and may occur independently of bone mass. Use of vitamin D (VD) supplementation is still debated in this setting. This review will focus on the interactions between different metabolites of VD and pituitary hormones, and the effects of VD supplementation on bone metabolism in patients with pituitary diseases.

#### Children being treated with Growth Hormone grew faster if they had higher levels of Vitamin D - May 2022

 **Effect of Vitamin D level on growth velocity of RHGH treated children** 

QJM: An International Journal of Medicine, Volume 113, Issue Supplement_1, March 2020 https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa063.034

Objective

Recent studies have shown a relationship between vitamin D status, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 axis. Aims of the study are: 1- To evaluate the vitamin-D blood level in children on substitution treatment with rhGH. 2. To find out correlation between the vitamin D level and growth velocity with rhGH therapy, height, height SDS, height/height SDS after 1 year of treatment

Methods

The study included 173 prepubertal children, with short stature on treatment with rhGH (90 girls and 81 boys), aged between 2 and 10.3 years. To determine vitamin D status we measured serum 1,25-OH vitamin D by taking a single blood sample in the morning, in a fasting stage. Growth velocity over the year of observation, starting height, height SDS, height at the end of the year and its SDS all were calculated and correlated to vitamin D level.

Results

In the present study: 56 patients had vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml); 54 had vitamin D insufficiency (10–20 ng/ml) and 63 had vitamin D sufficiency (>20 ng/ml). No statistical significance correlation was found between vitamin D level and height, height SDS, follow up height, and follow up height SDS (P.09, .066, .455, .927 respectively)

 **Significant positive correlation was found between vitamin D and growth velocity (r .445 and P.0001).** 

Conclusions

Optimizing vitamin D level in patients with short stature under growth hormone therapy may improve growth velocity and response to growth hormone.

#### The fine crosstalk between vitamin D and pituitary gland – 2023

Int J Bone Frag. 2023; 3(1):2-6 [https:doi.org/10.57582/IJBF.230301.002](https:doi.org/10.57582/IJBF.230301.002)

Vitamin D, unlike other vitamins, is a fat-soluble steroid hormone rather than a cofactor for enzymatic reactions. The main role of vitamin D is to regulate bone metabolism and calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Lack of vitamin D causes osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults, and rickets in children. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression levels throughout the body are quite variable. Interestingly, VDRs are found in pituitary tissue. Unsurprisingly, vitamin D levels might impact hypophyseal production or activity of hormones such as growth hormone, gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone), prolactin, corticotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). On the other hand, pituitary hor­mones also influence vitamin D metabolism and several pituitary diseases are known to impact bone health. The aim of the present review is to collect available data on the crosstalk between vitamin D and the pituitary gland.

!!!!Vitamin D in pituitary driven osteopathies
Pituitary [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11102-024-01439-3]

The evidence that pituitary hormones may bypass peripheral endocrine glands to exert remarkable effects on the skeleton is gaining ground. Both hormonal excess and deficit may determine impairment in bone structure, and they commonly result in bone loss in patients affected by pituitary and neuroendocrine disorders. Vertebral fractures are the most common skeletal alterations and may occur independently of bone mass. Use of vitamin D (VD) supplementation is still debated in this setting. This review will focus on the interactions between different metabolites of VD and pituitary hormones, and the effects of VD supplementation on bone metabolism in patients with pituitary diseases.

!!!!Children being treated with Growth Hormone grew faster if they had higher levels of Vitamin D - May 2022
__Effect of Vitamin D level on growth velocity of RHGH treated children __

Objective
Recent studies have shown a relationship between vitamin D status, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 axis. Aims of the study are: 1- To evaluate the vitamin-D blood level in children on substitution treatment with rhGH. 2. To find out correlation between the vitamin D level and growth velocity with rhGH therapy, height, height SDS, height/height SDS after 1 year of treatment

Methods
The study included 173 prepubertal children, with short stature on treatment with rhGH (90 girls and 81 boys), aged between 2 and 10.3 years. To determine vitamin D status we measured serum 1,25-OH vitamin D by taking a single blood sample in the morning, in a fasting stage. Growth velocity over the year of observation, starting height, height SDS, height at the end of the year and its SDS all were calculated and correlated to vitamin D level.

Results
In the present study: 56 patients had vitamin D deficiency (&lt;10 ng/ml); 54 had vitamin D insufficiency (10–20 ng/ml) and 63 had vitamin D sufficiency (&gt;20 ng/ml). No statistical significance correlation was found between vitamin D level and height, height SDS, follow up height, and follow up height SDS (P.09, .066, .455, .927 respectively)
__Significant positive correlation was found between vitamin D and growth velocity (r .445 and P.0001).__

Conclusions
Optimizing vitamin D level in patients with short stature under growth hormone therapy may improve growth velocity and response to growth hormone.

!!!!The fine crosstalk between vitamin D and pituitary gland – 2023

Vitamin D, unlike other vitamins, is a fat-soluble steroid hormone rather than a cofactor for enzymatic reactions. The main role of vitamin D is to regulate bone metabolism and calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Lack of vitamin D causes osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults, and rickets in children. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression levels throughout the body are quite variable. Interestingly, VDRs are found in pituitary tissue. Unsurprisingly, vitamin D levels might impact hypophyseal production or activity of hormones such as growth hormone, gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone), prolactin, corticotropin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). On the other hand, pituitary hor­mones also influence vitamin D metabolism and several pituitary diseases are known to impact bone health. The aim of the present review is to collect available data on the crosstalk between vitamin D and the pituitary gland.
