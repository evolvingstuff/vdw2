#### Propagation by COVID-19 at high altitude: Cusco case - May 2020

 **Many of the COVID-19 infections are in tourists (who have not gotten lots of UVB), not locals** 

 **"....Cusco, 6.7 % of men are obese, compared to Lima, where 24.4 % are.""**

 **Note - The highest altitude state in the US (with the most UVB) also has the lowest obesity** 

[Colorado has the best UV (and thus best health) in the US](/posts/colorado-has-the-best-uv-and-thus-best-health-in-the-us) has the following chart
