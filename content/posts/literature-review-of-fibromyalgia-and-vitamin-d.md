# Fibromyalgia - should we be testing and treating for vitamin D deficiency?

Aust Fam Physician. 2011 Sep;40(9):712-6.

Daniel D, Pirotta MV. 

MBBS, FRACGP, DCH, was an academic registrar, Department of General Practice, University of Melbourne, Victoria.

Aim This review aims to synthesise the evidence regarding any association between vitamin D deficiency and fibromyalgia, addressing whether general practitioners should be testing and treating these patients for vitamin D deficiency. 

Methods A systematic literature review was performed, using MEDLINE as the primary database, to find and critically appraise all relevant research fulfilling inclusion criteria from January 1990 until September 2010. 

Results There were conflicting results in the cross sectional studies obtained, with no association in studies using control groups and mixed results in larger population based studies. One adequately powered randomised controlled trial suggests fibromyalgia pain is not improved by vitamin D supplementation. 

Discussion The evidence for an association between fibromyalgia and vitamin D deficiency is inconclusive, with no improvement in pain on supplementation. However, patients with concurrent risk factors for deficiency should be tested and treated for vitamin D deficiency to minimise osteoporosis risk and maximise muscular strength.

## Comment: Their only random controlled trial was

* only 3 months - not long enough to regrow muscle or bone. 

* did not have any Calcium or Magnesium to regrow them with

* strangely, 50 of the the placebo participants greatly increased their levels of vitamin D - so there was not much difference
