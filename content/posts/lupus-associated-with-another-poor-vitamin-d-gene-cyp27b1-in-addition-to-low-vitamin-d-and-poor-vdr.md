#### The role of vitamin D-synthesizing enzyme CYP27B1 in systemic lupus erythematosus

Turk J Med Sci. 2022 Aug;52(4):984-989. [doi: 10.55730/1300-0144.53899](https://doi.org/10.55730/1300-0144.53899)

Background: To measure the expression of 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and serum 25(OH)D concentration in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to investigate the role of CYP27B1 in SLE.

Methods: Seventy-seven SLE patients and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled from September 2017 to January 2020. The study design is cross-sectional. mRNA expression of CYP27B1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR, the protein level of CYP27B1 was quantified by western blotting, and the serum level of 25(OH) D was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results: The mRNA expression of CYP27B1 in PBMCs was significantly lower in SLE patients than in HCs (p < 0.001), and the protein quantification confirmed that CYP27B1 expression was lower in SLE patients than in HCs (p = 0.001). Among SLE patients, the prevalence of lupus nephritis was higher in a subgroup with lower CYP27B1 mRNA expression than in a subgroup with normal CYP27B1 mRNA expression (41.07% vs. 14.28%, p = 0.028). The mRNA expression of CYP27B1 negatively correlated with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (r = -0.331, p = 0.003). Serum 25(OH)D concentration was lower in SLE patients than in HCs (37.64 ± 19.89 vs. 50.58 ± 12.74 ng/mL, mean ± SD, p = 0.003).

Discussion: The expression of CYP27B1 in PBMCs may be related to SLE pathogenesis, disease activity, and nephritis.

#### A 2021 study found Lupus to be 2.9 X more likely if a poor CYP24B1 gene

 **Cytochrome P450 27B1 Gene Polymorphism rs10877012 and rs4646536 in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** 111

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a severe inflammatory connective tissue disease induced by autoimmunity. The cytochrome p450 27B1 gene, activating Vitamin D precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in immunity cells resulted in autoimmune disorders. This study was assessing the correlation and clinical pathological characteristics relationship between the cytochrome p450 27B1 gene polymorphism rs10877012/rs4646536 and systemic lupus erythematosus to provide a rationale for determining the role that cytochrome p450 27B1 gene polymorphism plays in systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study, we investigated the association of rs10877012 (T/G) polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility in 156 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus compared to 156 healthy population, both groups came from the same Mendelian population by conformity to Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes and analyzed for the polymorphism using the polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction method. We found an association between the presence of the T allele at the polymorphic site ( **odds ratio= 2.94** ; 95 % confidence interval 1.77–4.86; <0.0001) and a decreased colorectal cancer incidence. rs10877012 polymorphism was associated with arthritis and positive Anti-double stranded DNA antibody and increased C-reactive protein happened in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

#### Lupus, having a poor GI function, probably needs large doses of a gut-friendly form of vitamin D

 **The genes restrict the Vitamin D getting from the blood to the cells  
A poor GI (digestion) restricts how much vitamin D get to the blood - unless a [Gut-Friendly Vitamin D](/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d) is used  
Large intermittent doses (non daily) overcome the Vitamin D Receptor restriction**

   * "Estimates range from 20 to 70 percent of people with lupus experience some sort of GI complication at some point in their lives."
