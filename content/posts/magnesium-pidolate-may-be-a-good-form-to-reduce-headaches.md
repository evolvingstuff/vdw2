Magnesium deficiency may occur for several reasons, such as inadequate intake or increased gastrointestinal or renal loss. A large body of literature suggests a relationship between magnesium deficiency and mild and moderate tension-type headaches and migraines. A number of double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that magnesium is efficacious in relieving headaches and have led to the recommendation of oral magnesium for headache relief in several national and international guidelines. Among several magnesium salts available to treat magnesium deficiency, magnesium  **pidolate**  may have high bioavailability and good penetration at the intracellular level. Here, we discuss the cellular and molecular effects of magnesium deficiency in the brain and the clinical evidence supporting the use of magnesium for the treatment of headaches and migraines.

* “A recent observation by Assarzadegan and colleagues <sup>[9]</sup> indicated that a decrease in magnesium levels in serum increased the odds of acute migraine headaches by a factor of 35 in 40 patients with migraine versus 40 healthy controls, and that magnesium deficiency is an independent risk factor in the incidence of migraines. “

* The duration of 1500 mg daily oral magnesium  **pidolate**  treatment needed to normalize serum magnesium levels was investigated by Aloisi and colleagues in a study on 40 children designed to evaluate the correlation between magnesium deficiency and the effect on visual evoked potentials. The analysis showed that a treatment lasting 20 days was sufficient to normalize serum magnesium levels in 90% of treated patients.<sup>[68]</sup>

* Magnesium  **pidolate**  may have high bioavailability <sup>[35,36]</sup> and good penetration at the intracellular level <sup>[37]</sup>. Furthermore, magnesium  **pidolate**  is able to reverse magnesium deficiency responsible for headaches, even after a short administration period <sup>[31]</sup>, and to prevent pediatric tension-type headaches <sup>[38]</sup>. 

* “The Italian Headache Society (SISC) guideline mentions magnesium  **pidolate**  supplementation for menstrual migraine and pre-menstrual syndrome patients, but a precise administration schedule has not been established <sup>[74]</sup>. “

* Magnesium  **pidolate**  has high bioavailability and good intracellular penetration <sup>[82]</sup> and it may reverse the magnesium deficiency responsible for headaches, even after a short administration period. Tissue culture and animal model studies indicate that magnesium  **pidolate**  may be slightly more effective than other magnesium salts in crossing the BBB <sup>[95]</sup>, and magnesium in general is believed to exert neuroprotective functions. Further studies on the tissue distribution of magnesium  **pidolate**  may help to better understand its specific properties.

#### Asked Perplexity AI to Compare Magnesium Pidolate with other forms for reducing headaches

 **Clipped from Feb 2024 answer** 

*  **Bioavailability and Absorption:**  The absorption of magnesium from supplements can vary widely, influenced by the specific magnesium salt (e.g., oxide, citrate, pidolate) and the presence of other dietary factors. While magnesium pidolate is suggested to have high bioavailability, other forms like magnesium citrate are also well-absorbed

*  **Conclusion**  Magnesium pidolate may offer advantages in terms of bioavailability and intracellular penetration, which could theoretically make it more effective for reducing headaches compared to forms with lower bioavailability.
