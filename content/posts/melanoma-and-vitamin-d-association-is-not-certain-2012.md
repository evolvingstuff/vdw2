## Vitamin D and melanoma incidence and mortality.

Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2013 Jan;26(1):9-15. [doi: 10.1111/pcmr.12015.](https://doi.org/10.1111/pcmr.12015.) Epub 2012 Oct 24.

The role of vitamin D (25-OH-D, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and its potential confounders in relationship to melanoma risk and mortality is discussed. The paradox that ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is the major environmental risk factor for melanoma etiology as well as a major source of vitamin D might be explained by viewing vitamin D levels as the result of a healthy lifestyle rather than a cause of health.
