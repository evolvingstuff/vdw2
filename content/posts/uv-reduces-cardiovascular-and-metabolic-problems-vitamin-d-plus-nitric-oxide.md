Background/purpose: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has both harmful and beneficial effects on human skin and health. It causes skin damage, aging, and cancer; however, it is also a primary source of vitamin D. Additionally, UV radiation can impact energy metabolism and has protective effects on several cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in mice and humans. However, the mechanisms of UV protection against these diseases have not been clearly identified.

Methods: This review summarizes the systemic effects of UV radiation on hypertension and several metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice, and we also consider the mechanisms of action of the related regulators nitric oxide (NO) and vitamin D.

Results: UV exposure can lower blood pressure and prevent the development of  **cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders** , such as 

* metabolic syndrome, 

* obesity, and 

* type 2 diabetes,

primarily through mechanisms that depend on UV-induced NO. 

UV radiation may also  **effectively delay the onset of type 1**  diabetes through mechanisms that rely on UV-induced vitamin D. UV-induced NO and vitamin D play roles in preventing and slowing the progression of  **NAFLD.** 

Conclusion: UV exposure is a promising nonpharmacological intervention for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. NO and vitamin D may play a crucial role in mediating these effects. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the exact mechanisms and determine the optimal dosage and exposure duration of UV radiation.
