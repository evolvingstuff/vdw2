#### Virtually the entire world recognizes that sunblock greatly reduces the amount of vitamin D you can get from the sun.

#### AVIDAS PHARMACEUTICALS has been granted an international patent to add vitamin D to sunscreen lotions and skin lotions.

### The "therapeutically effective amount" appears to be granted for the following extremely wide range

 **<span style="color:#090;">0.1 International Units per square centimeter (IU/cm2) to about 1000 IU/cm2</span>** 

### They claim that vitamin D thus applied might have benefit to

disorders and diseases associated with low calcium uptake; bone-related disorders and diseases including osteopenia, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and rickets; vascular disorders and diseases including coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and peripheral artery disease; autoimmune disorders and diseases including multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, Grave's disease, and lupus; tuberculosis; periodontal disorders and diseases; chronic pain; seasonal affective disorder; cognitive impairment; depression; type I diabetes; chronic renal disease; hypoparathyroid; Parkinson's disease, and certain types of cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and skin cancer. 

### The patent even seems to grant license for transdermal vitamin D with NO sun-blocking components.

##### Example 5: Therapeutic Vitamin D Formulations ( in description section)

<sup>[0113]</sup> The instant invention also includes therapeutic vitamin D formulations generally as taught above, but  **that do not include a sun-protecting agent** . Formulations according to this Example include a vitamin D compound present in an amount that, when administered to an individual (preferably, transdermally in one or more applications), is therapeutically effective to increase the individual's serum vitamin D levels. 

#### Patent covers many different forms - not just cream

<sup>[0072]</sup> The inventive formulations may, in various exemplary, non-limiting embodiments, be provided in forms suitable for topical administration and that result in the transdermal delivery of a therapeutically effective amount of vitamin D, for example and without limitation the inventive formulations may be provided as creams, gels, liquids, lotions, solutions, sprays, emulsions, aerosols, and combinations thereof, and may provide multilamellar vesicles, liposomes, nanospheres, microsponges, or combinations thereof. In certain exemplary, non-limiting embodiments, the active agents, including vitamin D, may be encapsulated (including microencapsulated) in the inventive formulations, for example, to be released when the encapsulation is ruptured under pressure, for time-release of the agent, and so forth. Suitable encapsulating materials and techniques, including those which release the encapsulated agent over time, are known in the art.
