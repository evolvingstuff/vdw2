* Improving magnesium and vitamin D status concomitantly in the Owt/Ob population may lead to greater improvements in cardiometabolic outcomes than vitamin D supplements alone.

* Participants who received MagD had a greater increase in serum 25OHD compared to participants in VitD Group.

* There were no statistically significant effects of treatment on serum PTH concentrations, markers of inflammation, and blood pressure between and within groups.

* A combined magnesium and vitamin D treatment may be more effective in raising serum 25OHD concentrations compared to vitamin D supplement alone in Owt/Ob

 **Much larger response to Vitamin D when Mg was assed**

Objective

Poor vitamin D and Magnesium status is observed in individuals who are overweight and obese (Owt/Ob) and is often associated with heightened cardiovascular disease risk. Magnesium is a cofactor that assists in vitamin D metabolism. We aimed to determine (1) the efficacy of a combined magnesium and vitamin D regimen compared to vitamin D only on raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations, and (2) the effects of these supplements on cardiometabolic outcomes.

Methods

This was a 12-week double-blind, randomized controlled trial with three treatment arms: 

* 1) magnesium + vitamin D (MagD) Group (360 mg magnesium glycinate + 1000 IU vitamin D 3 daily), 

* 2) vitamin D only (VitD) Group (1000 IU vitamin D 3 daily), and 

* 3) a Placebo Group. 

A total of 95 overweight or obese participants were randomized into one of the three study arms. Anthropometry, dietary intake, concentrations of serum 25OHD, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum inflammatory markers, and blood pressure were obtained at baseline and week 12.

Results

The MagD group experienced the greatest increase in serum 25OHD concentrations (by 6.3±8.36 ng/mL, p<0.05). There was a decrease in systolic blood pressure (by 7.5±8.26 mmHg, p<0.05) for individuals who had a baseline systolic blood pressure >132 mmHg for the MagD group. There were no statistically significant treatment effects on serum PTH concentrations and markers of inflammation.

Conclusion

A combined magnesium and vitamin D treatment may be more effective in increasing serum 25OHD concentrations compared to vitamin D supplementation alone in Owt/Ob individuals.

 **Not much difference in blood pressusre with add small small amount of Mg and Vitamin D**

#### VitaminDWiki summary

Daily diet  of the overweight/obese contained 300 mg of Magnesium, 

1,000 IU of Vitamin D for 3 months got a response ot 2 ng

&nbsp; Note: Response to 1000 IU typically takes 6 months

&nbsp; Note: Small response is expected in those who are overweight or obese

Adding just 51 mg daily of Magnesium Glycinate got a Vitamin D response of 6 ng

&nbsp; Note: A few years ago it appeared that the maximum update of Mg was only 100 mg per meal

&nbsp; Note: Have seen many studies showing increased Vitamin D response, but none this big

&nbsp; Speculation: Magnesium might have extracted some of the vitamin D stored in the fat tissue

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This could be determined by having a trial arm that only added Magnesium, with no Vitamin D
