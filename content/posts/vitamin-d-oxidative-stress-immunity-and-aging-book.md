## Features

Focuses on the role of vitamin D in oxidation, immunity, and aging

Includes the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the benefits of vitamin D

Covers the role vitamin D plays in oxidative stress including cancer, the nervous system, stress-mediated diseases, photoprotection and energy metabolism

Discusses the role of vitamin D in the regulation of the aging process and its impact on diseases of aging including senescence, mortality, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation

Oxidative stress, immune function and aging will be important common threads for the discussions in each chapter

## Summary

Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide public health problem in both developed and developing nations. This book focuses on the role of vitamin D in three areas: oxidation, immunity and aging. The text presents new information on the action of vitamin D in regulating numerous aspects of health, disease, and aging. The author addresses the molecular and cellular mechanism responsible for the benefits of vitamin D and discusses the role of vitamin D in oxidative stress, including cancer, the nervous system, stress-mediated diseases, photoprotection, and energy metabolism, as well in the regulation of the aging process and its impact on diseases of aging, mortality, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation.

## Adrian F. Gombart (editor)

received a Ph.D. degree in microbiology from the University of Washington. For many years, he was an assistant and associate professor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Division of Hematology and Oncology. He is currently a principal investigator in the Linus Pauling Institute and an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Oregon State University. Dr. Gombart is a member of the American Society for Hematology and the Society for Leukocyte Biology. Dr. Gombart’s research interests focus on the role of vitamin D in the innate immune response against infection. His laboratory studies the regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression by vitamin D and other nutritional compounds. He was recognized for his contributions to the field of vitamin D and immunity, with a Young Investigator Award from the Vitamin D Workshop in 2005.
