## Go to court: Not enough vitamin D/sunshine for the monkey

 **[Stourbridge pair in court for monkey cruelty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-16169756%20) BBC Dec 2011** 

Monkey had many bone fractures

Owners got four charges of cruelty under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

Owners of some pet reptiles setup UV lamps which their animals can use as they desire.

The administrator of this wiki site has setup UV lamp for himself.

Several friends who have cats have also purchased UV lamps - which their cats enjoy.

Probably any pet from equatorial regions should have access to UV/vitamin D.

Example: [African Grey parrots](www.palsvetlab.co.uk/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/63uvb.pdf) (file) need UVB

&nbsp; &nbsp; The most intelligent African Grey Parrot - Alex - apparently died due to lack of UVB/vitamin D
