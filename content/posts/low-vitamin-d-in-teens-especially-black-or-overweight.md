OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to characterize the vitamin D status of black and white adolescents residing in the southeastern United States (latitude: approximately 33 degrees N) and to investigate relationships with adiposity. 

METHODS: Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy for 559 adolescents 14 to 18 years of age (45% black and 49% female). Fat tissues, physical activity, and cardiovascular fitness also were measured. 

RESULTS: The overall prevalences of vitamin D insufficiency (<75 nmol/L) and deficiency (< or = 50 nmol/L) were 56.4% and 28.8%, respectively. 

Black versus white subjects had significantly lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in every season 

(winter, 35.9 + or - 2.5 vs 77.4 + or - 2.7 nmol/L; 

spring, 46.4 + or - 3.5 vs 101.3 + or - 3.5 nmol/L; 

summer, 50.7 + or - 4.0 vs 104.3 + or - 4.0 nmol/L; 

autumn, 54.4 + or - 4.0 vs 96.8 + or - 2.7 nmol/L). 

With adjustment for age, gender, race, season, height, and sexual maturation, there were significant inverse correlations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and all adiposity measurements, including 

BMI percentile (P = .02), 

waist circumference (P < .01), 

total fat mass (P < .01), 

percentage of body fat (P < .01), 

visceral adipose tissue (P = .015), and 

subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (P = .039). 

There were significant positive associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vigorous physical activity (P < .01) and cardiovascular fitness (P = .025). 

CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D status is prevalent among adolescents living in a year-round sunny climate, particularly among black youths. The relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, adiposity, physical activity, and fitness seem to be present in adolescence. PMID: 20439594
