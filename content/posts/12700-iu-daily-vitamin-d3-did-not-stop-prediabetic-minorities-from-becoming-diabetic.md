* 88,865 IU D3 weekly for a year

# Have not yet seen the study – but . . .

* Expect that the participants were very vitamin D deficient

* This study lacked a loading dose to fill up on vitamin D quickly

* Suspect that the blood levels of vitamin D did not rise much of the year

* The benefits of vitamin D to diabetes would not have started until the blood levels were above 40 ng
