Our aim was to ascertain whether or not vitamin D supplementation or deficiency in infancy could affect development of type 1 diabetes.</p><p>Methods A birth-cohort study was done, in which all pregnant women (n=12 055) in Oulu and Lapland, northern Finland, who were due to give birth in 1966 were enrolled. Data was collected in the first year of life about frequency and dose of vitamin D supplementation and presence of suspected rickets. Our primary outcome measure was diagnosis of type 1 diabetes by end of December, 1997.</p><p>Findings 12 058 of 12 231 represented live births, and 10 821 (91% of those alive) children were followed-up at age 1 year. Of the 10 366 children included in analyses, 81 were diagnosed with diabetes during the study. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decreased frequency of type 1 diabetes when adjusted for neonatal, anthropometric, and social characteristics (rate ratio <span>[RR]</span> for regular vs no supplementation 0-12, 95% CI 0-03-0-51, and irregular vs no supplementation 0-16, 0-04-0-74. Children who regularly took the recommended dose of vitamin D (2000 IU daily) had a RR of 0-22 (0-05-0-89) compared with those who regularly received less than the recommended amount. Children suspected of having rickets during the first year of life had a RR of 3-0 (1-0-9-0) compared with those without such a suspicion.</p><p>Interpretation Dietary vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes. Ensuring adequate vitamin D supplementation for infants could help to reverse the increasing trend in the incidence of type 1 diabetes.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vit-d-at-age-1-reduced-by-10x-t1d-later-in-life.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=finnish-study-was-cited-3073-times-as-of-oct2024>Finnish study was cited 3,073 times as of Oct 2024</h5><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11669699305892999823&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>An Update on the Effects of Vitamin D on the Immune System and Autoimmune Diseases - Aug 2022   <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23179784>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Vitamin D: Before, during and after Pregnancy: Effect on Neonates and Children – May 2022   <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091900>FREE PDF</a></p><ul><li>low vitamin D in children “… possible relationship with the development of such diseases as bronchiolitis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and autism included as VD non-classical actions.”</li></ul></li><li><p>Vitamin D’s Effect on Immune Function – April 2020 <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12051248>FREE PDF</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=does-more-vitamin-d-as-infant-result-in-fewer-autoimmune-diseases-as-adult-askedperplexity-ai---oct2024httpswwwperplexityaisearchdose-more-vitamin-d-as-infant-x45baciyrqmklnjgysjrna>Does more vitamin D as infant result in fewer autoimmune diseases as adult?

Vitamin D signaling regulates Aire and TRA expression in mTECs, providing a basis for links between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmunity. We find that mice lacking Cyp27b1, which cannot produce hormonally active vitamin D, display profoundly reduced thymic cellularity, with a reduced proportion of Aire+ mTECs, attenuated TRA expression, and poorly defined cortical-medullary boundaries. Markers of T cell negative selection are diminished, and organ-specific autoantibodies are present in knockout (KO) mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that loss of Cyp27b1 skews mTEC differentiation toward Ccl21+ intertypical TECs and generates a gene expression profile consistent with premature aging. KO thymi display accelerated involution and reduced expression of thymic longevity factors. Thus, loss of thymic vitamin D signaling disrupts normal mTEC differentiation and function and accelerates thymic aging.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/low-d-leads-to-autoimmune-later-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=press-release-for-the-studyhttpsmedicalxpresscomnews2024-10-vitamin-d-deficiency-autoimmune-diseaseshtml-how-vitamin-d-deficiency-can-lead-to-autoimmune-diseases><a href=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-10-vitamin-d-deficiency-autoimmune-diseases.html>Press release for the study</a>: How vitamin D deficiency can lead to autoimmune diseases</h5><p>by Keila DePape, McGill University</p><p>Reduced thymic cellularity and altered T cell development in CypKO mice.

A vitamin D deficiency at that stage of life causes the thymus to age more quickly, the researchers discovered.</p><p>The study is published in the journal Science Advances.</p><p>" <strong>An aging thymus leads to a &rsquo;leaky&rsquo; immune system,"</strong> said lead author John White, a Professor in and Chair of McGill&rsquo;s Department of Physiology. &ldquo;This means the thymus becomes less effective at filtering out immune cells that could mistakenly attack healthy tissues, increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes.&rdquo;</p><p>He noted that researchers have known for years that vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium for strong bones, and that more recent research has discovered its crucial role in regulating the immune system.</p><p>&ldquo;Our findings bring new clarity to this connection and could lead to new strategies for preventing autoimmune diseases,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Although the research was conducted with mice, the findings are relevant to human health because the thymus functions similarly in both species, White added.</p><p>The importance of a sunlight substitute</p><p>The findings highlight the importance of adequate vitamin D intake, especially for children.</p><p>&ldquo;In places like Montreal, where we stop making the vitamin from sunlight between late fall and early spring, supplementation is key,&rdquo; said White. &ldquo;If you have a young child, it&rsquo;s important to consult with your health-care provider to ensure they&rsquo;re getting enough.&rdquo;</p><p>The breakthrough builds on a 2001 Finnish study, which <strong>followed more than 10,000 children</strong> . It found that children who were supplemented early in life with vitamin D had up to a five-fold-lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life.</p><p>Finland, with its long periods of vitamin D winter, served as an ideal case study to learn more about the nutrient&rsquo;s many roles, said White.</p><p>In the McGill study, researchers used mice that couldn&rsquo;t produce vitamin D to examine how the deficiency affected the thymus, employing cell analysis and gene sequencing to see how it impacts the immune system.</p><p>In future studies, White hopes to explore how vitamin D affects the human thymus, something he notes has not been done before.</p><hr><h4 id=infants-with-high-vitamin-d-were-2x-less-likely-to-get-multiple-sclerosis-decades-later---2-studies>Infants with high vitamin D were 2X less likely to get Multiple Sclerosis decades later - 2 studies</h4><ul><li><p>Vitamin D status during pregnancy and risk of multiple sclerosis in offspring of women in the Finnish Maternity Cohort - 2016 May <a href=https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.4800>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Neonatal vitamin D status and risk of multiple sclerosis: A population-based case-control study - Jan 2017 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003454>FREE PDF</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=related-items-in-vitamindwiki>Related items in VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/food-allergies-and-low-vitamin-d-thymus-may-be-the-connection style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Food allergies and low vitamin D – thymus may be the connection – June 2016">Food allergies and low vitamin D – thymus may be the connection – June 2016</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/multiple-sclerosis-2x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-deficient-as-a-fetus-decades-earlier style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Multiple Sclerosis 2X more likely if vitamin D deficient as a fetus decades earlier – May 2016">Multiple Sclerosis 2X more likely if vitamin D deficient as a fetus decades earlier – May 2016</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/multiple-sclerosis-risk-reduced-30-percent-by-each-additional-10-ng-of-vitamin-d-at-birth-1500-danes style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Multiple Sclerosis risk reduced 30 percent by each additional 10 ng of vitamin D at birth (1500 Danes) – Jan 2017">Multiple Sclerosis risk reduced 30 percent by each additional 10 ng of vitamin D at birth (1500 Danes) – Jan 2017</a></p></li></ul></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382339"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382339",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382339"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382339"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382339"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382339"></script></body></html>
