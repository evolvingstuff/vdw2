### Highlights

Bone mineral status depends on plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis.

Vitamin D regulates bone remodelling via endocrine and intracrine activities.

Vitamin D stimulates or inhibits bone mineralisation under different circumstances.

Vitamin D activity requires an adequate vitamin D status as indicated by the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and appropriate expression of genes coding for vitamin D receptor and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1Î±-hydroxylase, the enzyme which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency contributes to the aetiology of osteomalacia and osteoporosis.  **The key element of osteomalacia, or rickets in children, is a delay in mineralization. It can be resolved by normalisation of plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis independently of vitamin D activity** . The well characterised endocrine pathway of vitamin D metabolism generates plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and these endocrine activities are solely responsible for vitamin D regulating plasma calcium and phosphate homeostasis and protection against osteomalacia. In contrast, a large body of clinical data indicate that an adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level improves bone mineral density protecting against osteoporosis and reducing fracture risk. Recent research demonstrates that the  **three major bone cell types have the capability to metabolise 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D**  to activate the vitamin D receptor and modulate gene expression. Dietary calcium intake interacts with vitamin D metabolism at both the renal and bone tissue levels to direct either a catabolic action on bone through the endocrine system when calcium intake is inadequate or an anabolic action through a bone autocrine or paracrine system when calcium intake is sufficient.
