#### The average vitamin D level increase with 4,000 IU was only 17 nanograms

 **<span style="color:#00F;">More reduction in diabetic parameters would be expected if any of the following</span>** 

1. Higher dose for everyone– getting an increase of say 30 nanograms

1. Use still higher dose for those at [high risk of being deficient](/posts/high-risk-of-little-vitamin-d) (such as obese, dark skin, etc)

1. [Use a type of vitamin D appropriate for those with poor guts, poor liver, poor kidney, etc](/posts/getting-vitamin-d-into-your-blood-and-cells)

BACKGROUND:

Type 2 diabetes is a global health concern, with an increased prevalence and high cost of treatment.

OBJECTIVE:

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation and improved vitamin D status on glycemia and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients.

DATA SOURCE:

We searched PUBMED/Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Cochrane Library (until January 2017).

STUDY SELECTION:

Prospective clinical trials were selected evaluating the impact of vitamin D supplementation on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in diabetic patients.

DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS:

We used a random-effects model to synthesize quantitative data, followed by a leave-one-out method for sensitivity analysis. The systematic review registration was CRD42017059555. From a total of 844 entries identified via literature search, 24 controlled trials (1528 individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes) were included. 

The meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in 

* HbA1c <span>[mean difference: -0.30%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.45 to -0.15, P < 0.001]</span>, 

* FPG [mean difference: -4.9 mg/dL (-0.27 mmol/L); 95% CI: -8.1 to -1.6 (-0.45 to -0.09 mmol/L), P = 0.003](mean%20difference:%20-4.9%20mg/dL%20(-0.27%20mmol/L);%2095%%20CI:%20-8.1%20to%20-1.6%20(-0.45%20to%20-0.09%20mmol/L),%20P%20=%200.003), and 

* HOMA-IR (mean difference: -0.66; 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.26, P = 0.001) 

following vitamin D supplementation and significant increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [overall increase of 17 ± 2.4 ng/mL (42 ± 6 nmol/L)](overall%20increase%20of%2017%20±%202.4%20ng/mL%20(42%20±%206%20nmol/L)).

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D supplementation, a minimum dose of 100 µg/d (4000 IU/d), may significantly reduce serum FPG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR index, and helps to control glycemic response and improve insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients.
