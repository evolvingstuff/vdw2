#### Is there any association between low vitamin D while pregnant and obesity in the offspring? asked[Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-any-association-betwe-Ayi_8gpdRziqjYJCQtF_3A)

The relationship between maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and offspring obesity is complex and shows varying patterns across different developmental stages.

 **Early Life Effects** 

Infants born to mothers with low vitamin D status tend to have lower fat mass at birth &nbsp;[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22623747/)

.Â However, this initial pattern shifts significantly as children grow older.

 **Later Childhood Impacts** 

Children born to vitamin D deficient mothers show increased adiposity and body fat in their later years:

* At ages 4 and 6, these children demonstrate greater fat mass &nbsp;[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22623747/)

* Higher body mass index (BMI) scores are observed at age 7 &nbsp;[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/9/2033)

* Boys appear more affected than girls, showing higher fat mass percentage and increased risk of being overweight &nbsp;[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/9/2033)

 **Biological Mechanisms** 

Several pathways explain this connection:

* Maternal vitamin D deficiency can alter DNA methylation in offspring adipose tissue, affecting genes involved in fat metabolism &nbsp;[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18770-4)

* The condition promotes increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation &nbsp;[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18770-4)

* Offspring of vitamin D deficient mothers show significant alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism &nbsp;[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18770-4)

 **Metabolic Changes** 

Children born to vitamin D deficient mothers exhibit several metabolic alterations:

* Higher blood glucose levels

* Increased adipose tissue volume

* Elevated blood lipid indices &nbsp;[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18770-4)

The evidence strongly suggests that maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may program offspring toward increased adiposity, though the effects may not be apparent until later in childhood &nbsp;[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22623747/) &nbsp;[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18770-4)

This relationship appears particularly pronounced in male offspring and in children of overweight or obese mothers &nbsp;[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/9/2033) &nbsp;[4](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/98/1/114/2823102)

##### Low Vitamin D during pregancy is a contributing, but not a major risk factor for obesity ([Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-low-vitamin-d-during-pregna-xD_fhbapTOOZ16VNL1GX.A))
