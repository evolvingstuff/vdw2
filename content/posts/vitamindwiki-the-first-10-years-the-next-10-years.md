### The first 10 years:

VitaminDWiki was started <a href="/posts/aboutus" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: AboutUs">Dec 2009</a>

As of Jan 2020, it has 11,000 page and 13,000 files, has taken 15,000 hours to create and has been seen 6 million times

### Currently, it appears likely that:

* Vitamin D levels in tissues will continue to drop for <a href="/posts/4-reasons-why-vitamin-d-supplementation-has-become-so-important-to-your-health" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: 4 Reasons why Vitamin D supplementation has become so important to your health">4 reasons:</a>

   * 1) Less vitamin D from the sun, 

   * 2) Less from food, 

   * 3) Fewer nutrients which are needed for Vit D, 

   * 4)  <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-receptors-have-become-less-activated" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 11481">Vitamin D Receptors have become less activated</a>

* People with poor immune systems have been <a href="/posts/surviving-and-passing-on-their-poor-genes" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 11481">surviving and passing on their poor genes</a>

* The risk of getting 44 diseases at least double if you have poor [Vitamin D Receptors](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor)

   * Fortunately, 10 supplements, such as resveratrol, improve the [Vitamin D Receptors](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor)

   * Increasing the activation of the [Vitamin D Receptors](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor) increases the amount of Vitamin D in the blood getting to the tissues

* [It is often better to take Vitamin D less often than once per day](/categories/better-than-daily)

* [Topical vitamin D](/posts/topical-vitamin-d) is substantially better for some people than oral Vitamin D

* [Emulsion Vitamin D](/posts/advances-in-vitamin-d-emulsions-nanoparticles-etc)  is substantially better for some people than oral Vit D

### My goal for the next 10 years is to significantly improve world  health

 **The following appears to be the best path toward that goal:** 

 **Show employers how much [money they will save](/categories/cost-savings-with-vitamin-d) by giving free Vitamin D to their employees and families** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; I anticipate that success with a few companies can be marketed to other companies and organizations

 **I have given up on trying to [show the proof](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need) to doctors and medical organizations** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Example of data being ignored: <a href="/posts/colorectal-cancer-is-associated-with-vitamin-d-17-meta-analyses-so-far-july-2018-gs-many-studies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Colorectal cancer is associated with Vitamin D (17 meta-analyses so far) – July 2018))
__All organizations change slowly, and they change especially slowly if it causes them to lose income__
~hs~ ~hs~ Example, JAMA took 15 years to agree with the US Surgeon General report that smoking caused cancer

__I am decreasing my reading and posting of Vitamin D and related studies__
I will virtually eliminate posting studies on rare diseases and studies that duplicate previous studies
I will greatly decrease my experiments with ((Inhaled vitamin D help lungs - many studies">inhaled Vitamin D</a> (it also does not support the main goal)

&nbsp; &nbsp; These savings will increase time for pursuing my main goal by ~50 more hours per month
