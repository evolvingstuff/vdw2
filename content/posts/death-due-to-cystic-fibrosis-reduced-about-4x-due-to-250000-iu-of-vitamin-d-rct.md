Stecenko, Thomas R. Ziegler and Vin Tangpricha \n\nBackground: Vitamin D insufficiency is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and vitamin D repletion may have an important role in improving clinical outcomes in CF. This randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study examined the feasibility and impact of a single, large dose of cholecalciferol on vitamin D status and clinical outcomes in subjects with CF.\n\nMethods: Thirty adults with were randomized in a double-blinded, pilot study to receive 250,000 IU cholecalciferol or placebo within 48 h of hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), clinical outcomes and potential adverse events were assessed up to 1-y after randomization. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to evaluate the difference in mean serum concentrations and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate survival.\n\nResults: Data from all subjects was analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from a mean of 30.6 ± 3.2 ng/mL to 58.1 ± 3.5 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.001) at one week and 36.7 ± 2.6 ng/mL by 12 weeks (p = 0.06) in the vitamin D group; in contrast, serum 25(OH)D concentrations remained unchanged in the placebo group. Unadjusted, one-year survival and hospital-free days were increased in the vitamin D group (p = 0.029, p = 0.036; respectively). There was also a trend toward increased IV antibiotic therapy-free days in the vitamin D group (p = 0.073). There were no signs of hypervitaminosis D or adverse events. Serum PTH and calcium concentrations were similar across both groups.\n\nConclusions: In this pilot study, a single, oral bolus of cholecalciferol increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations and was associated with a trend toward improved clinical outcomes in CF subjects hospitalized for a pulmonary exacerbation. Further investigation is needed into the clinical impact of improved vitamin D status in patients with CF.\n`

!!!!Pilot study of vitamin D supplementation in adults with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation: A randomized, controlled trial

Background: Vitamin D insufficiency is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and vitamin D repletion may have an important role in improving clinical outcomes in CF. This randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study examined the feasibility and impact of a single, large dose of cholecalciferol on vitamin D status and clinical outcomes in subjects with CF.

Methods: Thirty adults with were randomized in a double-blinded, pilot study to receive 250,000 IU cholecalciferol or placebo within 48 h of hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), clinical outcomes and potential adverse events were assessed up to 1-y after randomization. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to evaluate the difference in mean serum concentrations and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate survival.

Results: Data from all subjects was analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from a mean of 30.6 ± 3.2 ng/mL to 58.1 ± 3.5 ng/mL (p &lt; 0.001) at one week and 36.7 ± 2.6 ng/mL by 12 weeks (p = 0.06) in the vitamin D group; in contrast, serum 25(OH)D concentrations remained unchanged in the placebo group. Unadjusted, one-year survival and hospital-free days were increased in the vitamin D group (p = 0.029, p = 0.036; respectively). There was also a trend toward increased IV antibiotic therapy-free days in the vitamin D group (p = 0.073). There were no signs of hypervitaminosis D or adverse events. Serum PTH and calcium concentrations were similar across both groups.

Conclusions: In this pilot study, a single, oral bolus of cholecalciferol increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations and was associated with a trend toward improved clinical outcomes in CF subjects hospitalized for a pulmonary exacerbation. Further investigation is needed into the clinical impact of improved vitamin D status in patients with CF.
!!Approx 4X less risk of death due to single dose of Vitamin D
!!!! 1 person in vitamin D group died vs 5 died in the placebo group

__~~#00F:Wonder how many much less risk of death if vitamin D had been given multiple times.~~__
__Example: Give 250,000 IU vitamin D every 2 months.__

__~~#090:Suspect that it will be difficult to get approval for a large CF RCT in the future.~~__
__~~#090:The ethics committee would have a hard time allowing scores of CF deaths for the placebo group.~~__
