Context: Adequate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <span>[25(OH)D]</span> are required for optimal bone health, and low levels are associated with chronic diseases. 

Objective: We investigated whether 41 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D and calcium pathway genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1, VDR, and CASR) are associated with <span>[25(OH)D]</span> or modify the increase in <span>[25(OH)D]</span> from vitamin D3 supplementation. Design and setting: Baseline and year one <span>[25(OH)D]</span> measurements from a randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 clinical centers in the United States. 

Participants:  **1,787**  healthy non-Hispanic white participants aged 45-75 years. Interventions: Vitamin D3 (1000 IU/day), calcium carbonate (1200 mg/day elemental), both or placebo. 

Main outcome measures: Genotype main effects and interactions with vitamin D3 treatment estimated using multiple linear regression. 

Results: The mean baseline serum <span>[25(OH)D]</span> was 25.4 ± 8.7 ng/ml. Associations with baseline levels were discovered for SNPs in CYP24A1 (rs2209314, rs2762939) and confirmed for SNPs in GC and CYP2R1. After one year, <span>[25(OH)D]</span> increased on average by 6.1 ± 8.9 ng/ml on vitamin D3 treatment and decreased by 1.1 ± 8.4 ng/ml on placebo. The increase in <span>[25(OH)D]</span> due to vitamin D3 supplementation was modified by genotypes at rs10766197 near CYP2R1, rs6013897 near CYP24A1, and rs7968585 near VDR. 

Conclusions: The increase in <span>[25(OH)D]</span> attributable to vitamin D3 supplementation may vary according to common genetic differences in vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1), 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes. These findings have implications for achieving optimal vitamin D status and potentially for vitamin D-related health outcomes.
