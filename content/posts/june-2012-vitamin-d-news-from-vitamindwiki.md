### There was a lot of vitamin D news again this month.

>430 papers in PubMed alone

About 2% of the items found are posted on VitaminDWiki, and just a fraction of those make it to [Top Vitamin D news](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=98%2098&sort_mode=created_desc) - which is now continuously updated

## Five great ways to search for Vitamin D information now

*  **Google site search**  (simple) is in the upper right

*  **Search Options**  in the middle has 4 more methods - including  **search with images** 

## Left column shows recent articles in the same category

#### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(more features in the column soon)- example pages which you might find interesting

* [Sunny side of the hill is the healthiest – 400BC](/posts/sunny-side-of-the-hill-is-the-healthiest-400bc)

* [Vitamin D deficiency and disease described with 3 simple graphs](/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-disease-described-with-3-simple-graphs)

* [Yes, need more than 400 IU of vitamin D to strengthen bones](/posts/yes-need-more-than-400-iu-of-vitamin-d-to-strengthen-bones) 

> (This is the title the media should have used this month)

## [Strong proof that TAKING vitamin D reduces diseases](/tags/strong-proof-that-taking-vitamin-d-reduces-diseases.html)  currently proof for:

Hypertension,	Cardiovascular,	Diabetes T1	&  T2,	Back Pain,	Influenza, Falls, 	Pregnancy risks, 

Rickets, Multiple Sclerosis, Raynaud's pain, Menstrual Pain,  and C section

Expect many more diseases to be added in 2012 -as there currently are 700+ Vitamin D intervention trials.

## [Great vitamin D articles in Dermato-Endocrinology Journal](/tags/great-vitamin-d-articles-in-dermato-endocrinology-journal.html)

#### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; examples of some those articles already in VitaminDWiki:

* [Why randomized controlled trials of calcium and vitamin D sometimes fail ](/posts/why-randomized-controlled-trials-of-calcium-and-vitamin-d-sometimes-fail)

* [Does vitamin D deficiency contribute to erectile dysfunction?](/tags/does-vitamin-d-deficiency-contribute-to-erectile-dysfunction.html) 

* [Evidence-based D-bate on health benefits of vitamin D revisited](/tags/evidence-based-d-bate-on-health-benefits-of-vitamin-d-revisited.html) Dr. Holick

* [Vitamin D-insufficiency: An estimate of the situation in Germany](/tags/vitamin-d-insufficiency-an-estimate-of-the-situation-in-germany.html)

## Importance of vitamin D [cofactors](/tags/cofactors.html)

Amazed that the vast majority of vitamin D studies do not consider cofactors (other than [Calcium](/tags/calcium.html)) at all.

The latest source of information on Vitamin K2 is the book [Vitamin K2 and the Calcium Paradox – 2012](/tags/vitamin-k2-and-the-calcium-paradox-2012.html)

## Recording of Vitamin D Workshop in June was not permitted.

However, the VitaminDWiki has lots of Vitamin D News from the Endocrinology Conference which immediately followed the workshop.

## VitaminDWiki is becoming "popular": Unfortunately SPAMMERS have 'discovered' the VitaminDWiki

So you currently have to request permission to edit or create web pages

### Reminder: anyone who registers (free) can choose to be immediately informed when there are:

* new [blogs](/tags/blogs.html), 

* new items in any of 102+ [categories](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=0&deep=off&type=) (many were added in June)

* new [overviews](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=57) (currently there are 54)

* new [top news](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=98%2098&sort_mode=created_desc)

* [updates](/tags/updates.html) to existing pages, overviews, etc.
