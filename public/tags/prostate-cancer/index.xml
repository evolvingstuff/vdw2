They also provide dioxin and polychlorinated dioxin-like compounds (dl-compounds), which may interfere with vitamin D homeostasis. We investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) might be compromised by concomitant intake of dl-compounds.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 182 adults participating in the Norwegian Fish and Game Study. Participants who consumed fish liver and/or seagull eggs had higher dl-compound intake and blood concentrations than non-consumers (p &amp;lt; 0.001). \n\nVitamin D intake was higher (p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas serum 25(OH)D was lower (p = 0.029) in consumers than in non-consumers. \n\nAmong non-consumers, vitamin D intake was associated with serum 25(OH)D (?=1.06; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.63).

The association between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D did not seem to be compromised by intake of dl-compounds.\n\nCONCLUSION: To secure adequate vitamin D status while keeping the intake of dioxins and dl-polychlorinated biphenyls low, a healthy diet should include both supplemental vitamin D and oily fish. \n`

!!!!Fish liver and seagull eggs, vitamin D-rich foods with a shadow: results from the Norwegian Fish and Game Study.
Mol Nutr Food Res. 2012 Mar;56(3):388-98. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.201100395. Epub 2012 Feb 8.

SCOPE: Fish liver, fish liver oil, oily fish and seagull eggs have been major sources of vitamin D for the coastal population of Norway. They also provide dioxin and polychlorinated dioxin-like compounds (dl-compounds), which may interfere with vitamin D homeostasis. We investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) might be compromised by concomitant intake of dl-compounds.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 182 adults participating in the Norwegian Fish and Game Study. Participants who consumed fish liver and/or seagull eggs had higher dl-compound intake and blood concentrations than non-consumers (p &amp;lt; 0.001). 

Vitamin D intake was higher (p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas serum 25(OH)D was lower (p = 0.029) in consumers than in non-consumers. 

Among non-consumers, vitamin D intake was associated with serum 25(OH)D (?=1.06; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.63). This association was weaker among consumers (? = 0.52; 95% CI: -0.05, 1.08), but strengthened when adjusted for retinol intake (? = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.12, 1.21). The association between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D did not seem to be compromised by intake of dl-compounds.

CONCLUSION: To secure adequate vitamin D status while keeping the intake of dioxins and dl-polychlorinated biphenyls low, a healthy diet should include both supplemental vitamin D and oily fish. 
__Despite high nutrient content, dietary fish liver and seagull eggs should be restricted, due to dl-compounds and possible vitamin A-D antagonism.__

&lt;p>In this issue of Journal of Clinical Oncology, Crew et al 1 report results of an examination of vitamin D in 103 premenopausal breast cancer patients who participated in a 1-year trial of zoledronate compared with placebo, in which all women received daily vitamin D (400 IU) and calcium (1,000 mg). Seventy-four percent of women were vitamin D deficient at study entry shortly after diagnosis; deficiency was more common in black and Hispanic women than in white women. After 1 year, less than 15% of the white women (but no Hispanic or black women) who had been vitamin D deficient at baseline achieved sufficient levels in their blood. The authors conclude, “…our study suggests that a dose of 400 IU daily is inadequate in breast cancer patients even to maintain skeletal health, and is probably too low for meaningful anticancer effects.” They go on to comment that controversy exists as to the upper safe daily limit of vitamin D supplementation and suggest “…it may be prudent to follow serum levels of 25-OHD &lt;span>[25-hydroxyvitamin D]&lt;/span>…” This carefully conducted study echoes results recently reported by Neuhouser et al 2 (that approximately three fourths of patients with breast cancer from Los Angeles had inadequate blood levels of vitamin D) and by our group3 (that the same proportion of patients with breast cancer in Toronto had inadequate levels).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surviving Prostate Cancer - Book</title><link>/posts/surviving-prostate-cancer-book.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/surviving-prostate-cancer-book.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="amazonhttpwwwamazoncompatrick-walshs-surviving-prostate-cancerdp1455504181refsr_1_1sbooksieutf8qid1344653599sr1-1keywordspatrickwalsh27sguidetosurvivingprostatecancer">&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patrick-Walshs-Surviving-Prostate-Cancer/dp/1455504181/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1344653599&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=+Patrick+Walsh%27s+Guide+to+Surviving+Prostate+Cancer">Amazon&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose their lower arms (6%) during the spring and fall (FBE is 15.5%). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose half of their upper arms (4%; short-sleeved shirts or tee shirts) and all of their lower legs (14%; knee-length shorts/skirts) during the entire summer (FBE is 33.5%). However, adults have to work during the summer, so that they tend to expose only about 9.5—15.5% of their body (face, neck, hands and sometimes their lower arms) during their workweek. Thus, the amounts made during the summer are closer to half the values shown in the figures. For the children and adult body percentages exposed during each season see Table 1 of reference 44. The FBE is the percent body area exposed divided by 100%.\nThe final part of the calculation involves the ability of an adult to make vitamin D with age because it decreases with increasing age due to epidermal thinning.51 Because children (&amp;lt;22 yr) have the highest ability to make vitamin D , they have an age factor (AF) of unity compared to older adults; all other values are relative to theirs (Fig. 1): 0—20 yr (100% or 1.0), 22—40 yr (83% or 0.83), 41—59 yr (66% or 0.66) and 60+ yr (49% or 0.49).

Background: Sunlight contains UV radiation that affects human health in both detrimental (skin cancers) and beneficial (vitamin D3) ways. An evaluation of the vitamin D status of adult Americans (22-40, 41-59, 60+ yr) show many have deficient or insufficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, indicating they are not getting enough from sunlight or dietary sources. Those findings are in conflict with calculated values that insist people make “ample” vitamin D3 (?1,000 IU/day) from their “casual” or everyday outdoor exposures.

Objective: We investigated this situation using the outdoor UV doses of indoor-working adult Americans (~7,000) in the north (45°N) and south (35°N) to calculate how much vitamin D3 they produce each season of the year with and without vacationing.

Method: To do vitamin D3 calculations properly, we used action spectrum and geometric conversion factors, not previously incorporated into other calculations.

Results: Few indoor-working adults over 21 yr meet their daily vitamin D needs from everyday outdoor exposures anytime during the year, including summer. Only a few “outdoorsy” Caucasians (22-60 yr) can meet their vitamin D3 needs (~2,000 IU/day) during the summer, but only if they do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations.

Conclusions: Most indoor-working adult Americans do not go outside enough to meet their vitamin D3 needs all year. Only some outdoor-working adults can make enough vitamin D3 without using sunscreen but other adults cannot, even with a vacation during the summer. Indoor-working African Americans can never make enough vitamin D3 during the year even with a 3-week vacation.

!Introduction
Sunlight can affect human health because it contains UV radiation (290—400 nm) that has both detrimental (skin cancers) and beneficial (vitamin D_) health effects. Vitamin D, is formed in human skin when the UVB photons (290—315 nm) in sunlight break the B ring of the precursor molecule, 7-dehydrocholes-terol or provitamin D forming previtamin D , which thermally isomerizes (37°C) to vitamin D, by a membrane enhanced mechanism.1,2

Vitamin D affects a variety of adult health problems besides osteoporosis and osteomalcia. It lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients3,4 and the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disorders.5-8 Vitamin D decreases the incidence of type 2 diabetes,9,10 rheumatoid arthritis,11,12 and it prevents tooth loss13 and falls that can result in hip fractures of the elderly.14-16 The most hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvi-tamin D (1,25(OH) D), can affect a variety of cancers because cancer cells produce 1,25(OH)„D from either 25(OH)D17 or vitamin D,18 which can kill them via apoptotic cell death. This hormonal conversion to 1,25(OH) D inside the cancer cell may be responsible for reducing the mortality from different cancers:19 colon, breast, prostate, ovarian and melanoma.20-26 In support of those findings, is the reverse observation that about half the patients attending an outpatient, cancer-care clinic in Boston were vitamin D deficient during the summer.27 Production of 1,25(OH)„D in skin cells may be important for decreasing the incidence of melanoma28 because it causes growth inhibition and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo of melanoma cells.29-31 Ironically, regular, moderate sun exposures increase the survival of melanoma patients.20 In fact, more deaths occur from internal cancers and disorders associated with low UV exposures (50,000—63,000/yr), which are often related to lower serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D), than from high UV exposures that are often related to skin cancers, especially melanoma (about 10,000/yr).32,33 
doses relative to the horizontal plane to UV doses relevant to the human body using geometric conversion factors (GCF).49 We calculated both male and female indoor-working adult Americans&amp;#39; (22—40, 41—59, 60+ yr) vitamin D production in international units (IU) produced by Fitzpatrick skin types II, III, IV and V50 during each season of the year in the north (45°N) and south (35°N). We also take the decreasing capacity to make vitamin D with increasing age into account 51 and calculate the average amount people make everyday during the summer with or without a 1—3-week mixed vacation.

We normalized values to 100% using the children&amp;#39;s values (0-20 yr). 
The data plotted is the average of vitamin D3 formed in the epidermis and dermis from 0-20 yr (100%), 22-40 yr (83%), 41-59 yr (66%) and 60+ yr (49%); calculated from the data in Figure 1 of MacLaughlin and Holick (1985). 
Note that some seniors over 70 yr make less than 25% of the vitamin D that children &amp;lt;21 yr can make.67 {[tiki-download_file.php?fileId=2163|__~~#090:In VitaminDWik)i~~__]

For most people, their major source of vitamin D comes from exposing their skin to sunlight,34 which creates a public health dilemma because the UV radiation in sunlight also causes skin cancers. Skin cancers have been increasing at the alarming rate of about 4% (±1%) each year, so that health organizations have been warning the public to avoid sun exposure between 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. and have been advising them to wear protective clothing, sunglasses and sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) &amp;gt;15 while outdoors.35 However, the vitamin D status, measured in serum as 25(OH)D (where the &amp;#39;D&amp;#39; represents D or D), shows many American adults have insufficient levels (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L or &amp;lt;30 ng/ml) 17 for most of the year, especially during and after winter.36-41 These observations disagree with a recent publication by the American Academy of Dermatology that claims Americans are getting adequate &amp;quot;casual,&amp;quot; or everyday, UV exposures even if they diligently wear SPF 15 sunscreen, to make ample (&amp;gt;1,000 IU/day) vitamin D .42

However, we found many American children (&amp;lt;20 yr) are not getting enough everyday outdoor UV exposures43 to meet either their minimum (600 IU/day) or optimum (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) vitamin D needs for most of the year, except some Caucasian children during the summer, but only if they do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations.44 African American children are not even making the minimum amount of vitamin D all year due to the increased sunscreening effect of the melanin in their skin.45

Here we investigated the indoor-working adult American&amp;#39;s (&amp;gt;22 yr) situation by calculating the amount of vitamin D, they make from their everyday exposure to sunlight. We used UV doses calculated46 from an Environmental Protection Agency two-year survey of 9,386 Americans,47 over 7,000 of which were adults, located all over the contiguous United States (US). We first adjusted their erythemally-weighted UV doses to previtamin D -weighted UV doses using action spectrum conversion factors (ASCF),48 and then adjusted those previtamin D -weighted UV
Figure 1 shows a decreasing capacity to make vitamin D with increasing age. We normalized the data from MacLaughlin and Holick (1985) 51 using the American children (0—20 yr) because they have the highest capacity to make vitamin D, (100% or 1.0). Compared to American children (&amp;lt;22 yr), the youngest adult Americans (22—40 yr) have 83% (or 0.83) and the middle-aged adults (41—59 yr) have 66% (or 0.66), while the senior adults (60+ yr) only have 49% (or 0.49) their capacity to make vitamin D . We used these fractions in the vitamin D3 calculations for the different age groups of adults presented in Figures 2—5.

!!Figure 2A Northern US
	 {img fileId=2165}

shows the average amounts of vitamin D, (IU/day) made by indoor-working adult Americans of reproductive/child-rearing ages (22—40 yr) with Fitzpatrick skin types II—V during each season of the year, excluding vacations and sunscreen use (see in ref. 44) in the north (45°N, Fig. 2A) and south (35°N, Fig. 2B). 
Caucasians with skin type II (also includes type I) can make the minimum amount of vitamin D, (~600 IU/day) during the summer so that they are not deficient, but only if they wear &amp;quot;sporty&amp;quot; clothing and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. 
Almost no one else, except some outdoor workers, in the young adult age group can make enough vitamin D to meet his or her needs all year.

!!Figure 3 
shows the average amounts of vitamin D, (IU/day) made by middle-aged (41—59 yr) indoor-working Americans with Fitzpatrick skin types II—V during each season of the year, excluding vacations and sunscreen use, in the north (45°N; Fig. 3A) and south (35°N, Fig. 3B). Again, only Caucasians with skin type II (and type I) can make enough vitamin D to meet their needs during the summer, but only if they wear &amp;quot;sporty&amp;quot; clothing and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. Almost no one else, except some outdoor workers, can make enough vitamin D to meet his or her needs all year.

!!Figure 4 
shows the average amounts of vitamin D, (IU/day) made by senior (60+ yr) indoor-working or retired Americans with Fitzpatrick skin types II—V during each season of the year, excluding vacations and sunscreen use, in the north (45°N; Fig. 4A) and south (35°N; Fig. 4B). Almost no one in the senior group can make the minimum amount of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) all year so that they are not deficient. No senior can meet their vitamin D need all year from everyday exposures even with a 3-week vacation (see Fig. 5), unless they either work or stay outdoors for most of the day, to have sufficient blood levels of 25(OH)D (&amp;gt;50 nmol/L or &amp;gt;20 ng/ml).

!!Figure 5 
{img fileId=2164}
shows the average amount of vitamin D indoor-working adults over 21 yr can make each day during the summer without and with a 1-, 2- or 3-week summer vacation. These vacation estimates include the use of the equivalent of SPF 4 sunscreen only during a beach vacation and are averages of four different types of vacations: beach, sightseeing, country and home.46 Only some skin type II Caucasians (22—40 yr) will meet their minimum vitamin D needs (~600 IU/day) during the summer, and some can possibly meet their optimum vitamin D needs (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/ day) if they take a 2-week vacation. The older Caucasians (60+) and skin type III will need at least a 3-week vacation. However, no other indoor-working adult will meet their minimum vitamin D needs (600—800 IU/day), let alone their optimum needs (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day), all year even with a 3-week vacation at 40°N.

!!Discussion
According to current findings, people need ~2,000 IU/day to maintain blood levels of 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L or 30 ng/ml.52,53 Our calculations revealed that only some &amp;quot;outdoorsy&amp;quot; indoor-working Caucasians of skin type II (22—59 yr) may make optimal amounts of vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) during the summer, but only if they expose more than 30% of their body every day to sunlight, take a 2—3 week vacation at latitudes &amp;lt;40°N, and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. The summer values shown in the figures are very optimistic because most adults work indoors (&amp;gt;90%) and, consequently, wear more clothing during their workweek, exposing only ~10—15% of their body to UV. Thus, most indoor-working adults that wear professional clothing will actually make about half the values shown in the figures during the summer and will not meet their minimum vitamin D needs. As people age, their ability to make vitamin D from the same UV exposure decreases (Fig. 1) so that only the most active &amp;quot;outdoorsy&amp;quot; Caucasian adults over 60 yr can make the minimum amount of vitamin D (800 IU/day) they need during the summer to prevent deficiency (&amp;gt;50 nmol/L; Figs. 2—4). Caucasians over 60 yr with skin type II, and all other skin types over 21 yr do not meet their minimum vitamin D needs from everyday outdoor exposures all year and would need to be supplemented,54 except some people during the summer if they wear sporty clothing to work and also take a 2—3 week vacation (see Fig. 5).

Overall our findings agree with reports of vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;50 nmol/L; &amp;lt;20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L;

&amp;lt;30 ng/ml) among adults in the US.36-41 Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency increases with increasing latitude, age and skin color, so that almost all adult African Americans are deficient in vitamin D during and after winter and about half have insufficient levels during the summer. Unless an adult works outdoors for most of the day, especially the darker skin types, they cannot get enough UV exposure to make the minimum amount of vitamin D (~600 IU/day) so that they are not deficient, and they cannot possibly make optimal amounts of vitamin D to be sufficient (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) without supplementation unless they work outdoors (~5% US population).

The average time indoor-working adults stay outdoors during the summer months in the US is 93.5 ± 2.5 min/day in the south at ~35°N and 102.5 ± 5.5 min/day in the north at ~45°N.46 If that increasing time trend from south-to-north continues during the summer, we would expect people living around 55°N to stay outdoors for about 111.5 ± 9 min/day or less than 2 hr/day. However, Thieden et al. (2009) found Danish workers at ~56°N stay outdoors for almost 3 hr/day during the summer and have 25(OH)D blood levels ~82 nmol/L, similar to outdoor workers.56

Their study mixed outdoor worker&amp;#39;s (gardeners) times with indoor worker&amp;#39;s times, which increased the overall time outdoors. In addition, they only measured the UV exposures and 25(OH)D blood levels of 25 people, but they failed to disclose how many of those people worked outdoors. In contrast, a very large European study (&amp;gt;12,000 people) found about 60% of the English workers at 52°N had blood levels of 25(OH)D below 75 nmol/L during the summer months.57 Their findings agree with our estimates that about half the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; (clothing) amount of vitamin D, Caucasian Americans make at 40°N (&amp;lt;800 IU/day) can be made at 52°N (&amp;lt;400 IU/day) based on erythemally-weighted doses measured at the same latitude in the Netherlands.58 People at 52°N receive about half the annual erythemally-weighted UV dose that Americans get at ~40°N, and consequently would make about half the amount of vitamin D Americans make during any season of the year.

The epidemiology results and our calculated amounts of vitamin D/day produced by Americans (&amp;gt;21 yr) significantly differ from what the American Academy of Dermatology claims.42 They claim people can make &amp;quot;ample&amp;quot; vitamin D, (&amp;gt;1,000 IU/day) from &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; sun exposure, even if they diligently wear SPF 15 sunscreen. However, they did not convert the erythemally-weighted UV doses to previtamin D -weighted UV doses and they did not convert horizontal plane doses to full-cylinder or actual body doses; they also did not take age into account. In contrast to their claims, we find the majority of indoor-working adult Americans are not going outside enough all year to get adequate everyday sun exposure to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) they need. Only some &amp;quot;out-doorsy&amp;quot; indoor-working Caucasians can make optimal vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) during the summer and some other skin types if they wear sporty clothing to work, take a 2—3 week vacation at latitudes &amp;lt;40°N (see Fig. 5), and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. The only other people who can make enough vitamin D are some of the outdoor-working adult Americans (~5% of the population). The most serious situation occurs with seniors (60+ yr) who cannot even make the minimum amount of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) all year even with a 3-week vacation. Furthermore, if anyone wears sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D (see in ref. 44).

We also find that almost all indoor-working adult Americans are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures all year to make optimal amounts of vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day).53,59-61 Some people with skin type II and some men with skin types III and IV can make the optimal amounts of vitamin D3 during the summer if they also take a 2—3 wk vacation (Fig. 5). However, if they wear sunscreen of SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D all year including during the summer (see in ref. 44). Thus, as found in the NHANES III study, Caucasian adult Americans with Fitzpatrick skin type II, and especially the darker skin types III, IV and V/VI, are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures for most of the year to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D, to prevent deficiency. The situation would be much worse if they diligently wore sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15. The African-Americans have a similar situation from melanin protection, which may explain the disparity in health found between whites and blacks.62 Furthermore, neither diet nor supplements correct this situation.63-65 In fact, 83% of Australian dermatologists, who advise people to take vitamin D supplements rather than get more UV exposure, have insufficient blood levels of 25(OH) D.66 Because the UV doses of indoor-working people around the world are similar to ours at similar latitudes (25—50°N),58 vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L or 30 ng/ml) is also found around the world, especially at higher latitudes (&amp;gt;50°N) and in countries that do not fortify foods.63 As a result, vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem with serious health consequences,67 which occurs from too little sun exposure.

Note that senior&amp;#39;s &amp;gt;70 yr might only make about half the amount shown in the figure.

However, too much sun exposure can result in skin cancer, which is also a potentially serious health consequence. Paradoxically, while intermittent UVB sunburns increases indoor workers incidence of melanoma, regular, moderate UVB exposures keeps outdoor workers incidence of melanoma at the same level68,69 although they get 3—10 times more UV exposure as indoor workers get.58 Furthermore, regular moderate outdoor UV exposures increase the survival of melanoma patients.20 Thus, complete avoidance of or protection from all peak hour (10 A.M.—4 P.M.) UVB exposures and the diligent use of SPF &amp;gt;15 sunscreens may not only increase the incidence of a variety of adult diseases and the mortality from some internal cancers, but may also paradoxically be increasing the incidence of and mortality from melanoma.28 However, fair-skinned people who are prone to burning should wear sunscreens during beach vacations or if they are outside for a while in the strong midday summer sun (11 A.M.—3 P.M.) to prevent sunburn and the initiation of melanoma. Because the overall population probably should not increase their UV exposure and consequently their risk of getting skin cancers, and because most people do not take 

FBE x AF. Where VDD is the &amp;quot;Vitamin D Dose&amp;quot; or the person&amp;#39;s standard erythemally-weighted, average seasonal solar UV dose in SED/day at either 45°N or 35°N multiplied by its corresponding ASCF48 to convert it to a standard vitamin D dose (SVD), and then multiplied by its corresponding GCF.49 The later step converts it from a horizontal plane dose to a person&amp;#39;s body dose. The ASCF for each season in the northern (45°N) and Southern (35°N) US are 1.034 and 1.104 for summer, 0.879 and 1.029 for fall, 0.565 and 0.842 for winter, and 0.9 and 1.049 for spring, respectively.48 The GCF conversion factors in the northern (45°N) US are 0.434 for clear skies during the summer and spring, and 0.508 for clear skies during the winter and fall. The GCF conversion factors in the Southern (35°N) US are 0.417 for clear skies during the summer and spring and 0.484 for clear skies during the winter and fall.49 Note here that although the typical effect of cloud cover is a slight increase (&amp;lt;3%) in the average GCF, it can reduce UVB radiation drastically (up to ~50%).58 FBE is the fraction body exposed (described below), and AF is the age factor (described below and see Fig. 1 ).

supplements on a regular basis, the best approach for maintaining healthy blood levels of 25(OH)D may be to supplement foods and drinks.

!!Materials and Methods
We give the details of these calculations in Godar et al.44 so that only the changes needed for the adult calculations are included below. We obtained the outdoor solar doses every season of the year for indoor-working adults (~95% population) from reference 46.

The equation for calculating the amount of vitamin D produced by people from an average daily, erythemally-weighted UV exposure during each season of the year is: Vitamin D3 (IU)/day = VDD x (4,861 IU/SED for skin type II) x STF x from outdoor UV exposures will depend on how much skin they expose to the sun while they are outside or their Fraction Body Exposed (FBE), so that one needs to multiply the FBE by the amount made from a whole body exposure (4,861 IU/ SED).44 We get the best estimates of how much body area adult Americans expose during each season of the year using the &amp;quot;rule of nines,&amp;quot; originally developed to estimate burn areas.70 To make these estimates, we assumed most adults would expose their face (3.5%), the front half of their neck (1%) and the front and back of both their hands (5%) during all seasons of the year, including winter (FBE is 9.5%; long-sleeved shirts/blouses and long pants/skirts). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose their lower arms (6%) during the spring and fall (FBE is 15.5%). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose half of their upper arms (4%; short-sleeved shirts or tee shirts) and all of their lower legs (14%; knee-length shorts/skirts) during the entire summer (FBE is 33.5%). However, adults have to work during the summer, so that they tend to expose only about 9.5—15.5% of their body (face, neck, hands and sometimes their lower arms) during their workweek. Thus, the amounts made during the summer are closer to half the values shown in the figures. For the children and adult body percentages exposed during each season see Table 1 of reference 44. The FBE is the percent body area exposed divided by 100%.
The final part of the calculation involves the ability of an adult to make vitamin D with age because it decreases with increasing age due to epidermal thinning.51 Because children (&amp;lt;22 yr) have the highest ability to make vitamin D , they have an age factor (AF) of unity compared to older adults; all other values are relative to theirs (Fig. 1): 0—20 yr (100% or 1.0), 22—40 yr (83% or 0.83), 41—59 yr (66% or 0.66) and 60+ yr (49% or 0.49). Note that adults over 70 yr can make as little as 25% of what children can make,67 so that our calculations are on the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; side for the eldest adults (60+ yr).

One can do the sunscreen calculations by simply dividing the amount of vitamin D made without sunscreen (equation above) by the SPF factor.71 These numbers only apply to people who diligently wear sunscreens correctly, i.e., they generously apply them prior to going outdoors, covering their entire body and they reapply them every 2 hours.

To convert IU of vitamin D to ng/ml blood levels of 25(OH) D multiply by 0.01,60 and to convert 25-(OH)D ng/ml to 25(OH) D nmol/L multiply by 2.599,71 or multiply IU of vitamin D by 0.0385 to get 25-(OH)D nmol/L directly.

Basically, 100 IU of ingested vitamin D raises blood levels of 25(OH)D by 0.6—1 ng/ml.52,53

This article provides updated guidance to clinicians and health professionals on the role of vitamin D in health for adults. The guideline development process is outlined in Box 1.\n\nThe generic term “vitamin D” is generally applied to two molecules: cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is formed through the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (wavelength, 290 – 315 nm) on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. This process is the major determinant of vitamin D status, as most adults are unlikely to obtain more than 5% – 10% of their vitamin D requirement from dietary sources. Cholecalciferol is also the major form of supplemental vitamin D currently available in Australasia. The other form of vitamin D, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), is produced by UV irradiation of the plant sterol ergosterol. Few vitamin D supplements now contain this form. Both forms of vitamin D are transported to the liver and metabolised to 25-OHD. This is the major circulating form and the metabolite routinely used to assess overall vitamin D status. It is also likely to be the metabolite responsible for hypercalcaemia when vitamin D is given in excess.3\n\nFurther hydroxylation occurs in the kidney to form the biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D), also known as calcitriol. This compound promotes absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gut, contributes to extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis directly and through an interaction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), facilitates mineralisation of the skeleton, and is important for muscle function.4 In addition, almost every nucleated cell expresses the vitamin D receptor, and many extrarenal tissues have the capacity to make 1,25-(OH)2D. Thus, vitamin D can operate via classical endocrine pathways (renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D under the control of calcium concentration via PTH, or phosphate, with secretion into the bloodstream to increase intestinal calcium absorption), as well as through autocrine and paracrine pathways involving local synthesis and actions.\n`

The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the amount of UV radiation exposure that just causes faint redness of the skin (erythema). At low wavelengths, in the UVB range, the action spectrum for production of erythema is similar to that for production of vitamin D. However, erythema, but not vitamin D, can also be produced by higher-wavelength UVA radiation. This limits the usefulness of MED as an index of vitamin D dose.5 Nevertheless, there are experimental data indicating that exposure of around 15% of the body surface (arms and hands or equivalent) to one-third of an MED near the middle of the day will result in the production of about 1000 IU (25 ?g) of vitamin D. Achieving this exposure on most days should generally, though not always, be sufficient to maintain vitamin D levels in the body.5,6\n\nThe amount of sun exposure required to produce one-third of an MED depends on several factors (Box 2). Less vitamin D is synthesised in winter, particularly at latitudes further from the equator. There is minimal transmission of UVB radiation through normal window glass. Although sunscreens also markedly reduce transmission in the UVB range, these are often inadequately applied and may have little impact on vitamin D status.7 Lack of any skin exposure to sunlight, through confinement indoors or from clothing, is a more common issue. Short UV radiation exposures (of a few minutes) may be more efficient at producing vitamin D, as prolonged exposure to UV radiation results in the production of sterols that have little effect on mineral metabolism.4\n\nFor people with moderately fair skin, adequate vitamin D levels are likely to be maintained in summer by a walk outside with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon, on most days. In winter the task is more difficult but, depending on latitude, walking outside at lunchtime for 7–40 minutes, with as much bare skin exposed as feasible, on most days, is likely to be helpful although at very southern latitudes, relatively little vitamin D would be formed 5(Box 2). Care needs to be taken by people in the far north of Australia where the UV intensity remains moderate to high throughout the year. Given the high incidence of skin cancer in Australasia, sunscreens and other UV radiation avoidance measures should be used if exposure is likely to be prolonged when the UV index is 3 or above and/or there is a risk of skin damage, even for people with vitamin D deficiency.

As there is such an individual variation of response to vitamin D supplementation, 25-OHD levels should be checked after 3 months. If adequate levels are not achieved, consideration should be given to possible underlying gastrointestinal disorders, such as coeliac disease. Most patients whose 25-OHD levels have normalised will need ongoing treatment at a maintenance dose of around 1000–2000 IU (25–50 ?g) per day or equivalent.\n\nFor adults in disadvantaged communities at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as dark-skinned migrants from low socioeconomic backgrounds, a strong case could be made to routinely provide vitamin D supplements, at the same dose used to treat moderate to severe deficiency, as early as possible, without initially measuring serum 25-OHD levels. As low calcium intake and associated hyperparathyroidism increase the degradation of vitamin D compounds,67,69,84 a daily intake of 1000–1300 mg of calcium, preferably from calcium-rich foods, should be encouraged.\n\nAccording to the best evidence currently available, adequate serum 25-OHD levels of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer to allow for a seasonal decrease), along with recommended dietary calcium intakes and weight-bearing or muscle strengthening exercise, are required for optimal bone and muscle function, at least in older age groups. Although it is likely that serum 25-OHD levels that are somewhat higher than those required for musculoskeletal health play a small role in prevention of some disease states, there is evidence emerging of potential adverse effects of higher serum 25-OHD levels under some circumstances. RCTs to test these hypotheses need to be undertaken before higher targets can be recommended with confidence.\n`

Most patients whose 25-OHD levels have normalised will need ongoing treatment at a maintenance dose of around 1000–2000 IU (25–50 ?g) per day or equivalent.\n\nFor adults in disadvantaged communities at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as dark-skinned migrants from low socioeconomic backgrounds, a strong case could be made to routinely provide vitamin D supplements, at the same dose used to treat moderate to severe deficiency, as early as possible, without initially measuring serum 25-OHD levels. As low calcium intake and associated hyperparathyroidism increase the degradation of vitamin D compounds,67,69,84 a daily intake of 1000–1300 mg of calcium, preferably from calcium-rich foods, should be encouraged.\n\nAccording to the best evidence currently available, adequate serum 25-OHD levels of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer to allow for a seasonal decrease), along with recommended dietary calcium intakes and weight-bearing or muscle strengthening exercise, are required for optimal bone and muscle function, at least in older age groups. Although it is likely that serum 25-OHD levels that are somewhat higher than those required for musculoskeletal health play a small role in prevention of some disease states, there is evidence emerging of potential adverse effects of higher serum 25-OHD levels under some circumstances. RCTs to test these hypotheses need to be undertaken before higher targets can be recommended with confidence.\n`├── HeadingNode

!Summary
*The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies, with the groups at greatest risk including housebound, community-dwelling older and/or disabled people, those in residential care, dark-skinned people (particularly those modestly dressed), and other people who regularly avoid sun exposure or work indoors.
*Most adults are unlikely to obtain more than 5 % – 10 % of their vitamin D requirement from dietary sources. The main source of vitamin D for people residing in Australia and New Zealand is exposure to sunlight.
*A serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer, to allow for seasonal decrease) is required for optimal musculoskeletal health.
*Although it is likely that higher serum 25-OHD levels play a role in the prevention of some disease states, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend higher targets.
*For moderately fair-skinned people, a walk with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon in summer, and with as much bare skin exposed as feasible for 7–40 minutes (depending on latitude) at noon in winter, on most days, is likely to be helpful in maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in the body.
*When sun exposure is minimal, vitamin D intake from dietary sources and supplementation of at least 600 IU (15 ?g) per day for people aged ? 70 years and 800 IU (20 ?g) per day for those aged &amp;gt; 70 years is recommended. People in high-risk groups may require higher doses.
*There is good evidence that vitamin D plus calcium supplementation effectively reduces fractures and falls in older men and women. 

Vitamin D status has emerged as a significant public health issue in Australia and New Zealand. An estimated 31% of adults in Australia have inadequate vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-OHD] level &amp;lt; 50 nmol/L), increasing to more than 50% in women during winter–spring and in people residing in southern states.1 This field of research is fast-moving, and it is timely to re-examine past recommendations 2 in light of the increasing number of medical conditions associated with low vitamin D status, and indications that higher levels of circulating serum 25-OHD may be required for optimal health. This article provides updated guidance to clinicians and health professionals on the role of vitamin D in health for adults. The guideline development process is outlined in Box 1.

The generic term “vitamin D” is generally applied to two molecules: cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is formed through the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (wavelength, 290 – 315 nm) on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. This process is the major determinant of vitamin D status, as most adults are unlikely to obtain more than 5% – 10% of their vitamin D requirement from dietary sources. Cholecalciferol is also the major form of supplemental vitamin D currently available in Australasia. The other form of vitamin D, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), is produced by UV irradiation of the plant sterol ergosterol. Few vitamin D supplements now contain this form. Both forms of vitamin D are transported to the liver and metabolised to 25-OHD. This is the major circulating form and the metabolite routinely used to assess overall vitamin D status. It is also likely to be the metabolite responsible for hypercalcaemia when vitamin D is given in excess.3

Further hydroxylation occurs in the kidney to form the biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D), also known as calcitriol. This compound promotes absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gut, contributes to extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis directly and through an interaction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), facilitates mineralisation of the skeleton, and is important for muscle function.4 In addition, almost every nucleated cell expresses the vitamin D receptor, and many extrarenal tissues have the capacity to make 1,25-(OH)2D. Thus, vitamin D can operate via classical endocrine pathways (renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D under the control of calcium concentration via PTH, or phosphate, with secretion into the bloodstream to increase intestinal calcium absorption), as well as through autocrine and paracrine pathways involving local synthesis and actions.

!!Sunlight as a source of vitamin D
For most people, the main source of vitamin D is skin exposure to sunlight. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the amount of UV radiation exposure that just causes faint redness of the skin (erythema). At low wavelengths, in the UVB range, the action spectrum for production of erythema is similar to that for production of vitamin D. However, erythema, but not vitamin D, can also be produced by higher-wavelength UVA radiation. This limits the usefulness of MED as an index of vitamin D dose.5 Nevertheless, there are experimental data indicating that exposure of around 15% of the body surface (arms and hands or equivalent) to one-third of an MED near the middle of the day will result in the production of about 1000 IU (25 ?g) of vitamin D. Achieving this exposure on most days should generally, though not always, be sufficient to maintain vitamin D levels in the body.5,6

The amount of sun exposure required to produce one-third of an MED depends on several factors (Box 2). Less vitamin D is synthesised in winter, particularly at latitudes further from the equator. There is minimal transmission of UVB radiation through normal window glass. Although sunscreens also markedly reduce transmission in the UVB range, these are often inadequately applied and may have little impact on vitamin D status.7 Lack of any skin exposure to sunlight, through confinement indoors or from clothing, is a more common issue. Short UV radiation exposures (of a few minutes) may be more efficient at producing vitamin D, as prolonged exposure to UV radiation results in the production of sterols that have little effect on mineral metabolism.4

For people with moderately fair skin, adequate vitamin D levels are likely to be maintained in summer by a walk outside with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon, on most days. In winter the task is more difficult but, depending on latitude, walking outside at lunchtime for 7–40 minutes, with as much bare skin exposed as feasible, on most days, is likely to be helpful although at very southern latitudes, relatively little vitamin D would be formed 5(Box 2). Care needs to be taken by people in the far north of Australia where the UV intensity remains moderate to high throughout the year. Given the high incidence of skin cancer in Australasia, sunscreens and other UV radiation avoidance measures should be used if exposure is likely to be prolonged when the UV index is 3 or above and/or there is a risk of skin damage, even for people with vitamin D deficiency. Some people are at particularly high risk of skin cancer, including those with a past history of skin cancer and those who are immunosuppressed. Such people need more rigorous sun protection and should discuss with their medical practitioner whether supplements might be more appropriate than sun exposure to maintain vitamin D levels.

!!Groups at high risk of vitamin D deficiency
Adult groups at high risk of vitamin D deficiency are shown in Box 3. 
Although older people are an at-risk group for developing vitamin D deficiency, because they have less substrate (7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin) and lower production rates of vitamin D from high levels of UV radiation exposure,13 they synthesise similar amounts of vitamin D as younger people at normal levels of UV radiation exposure.14 
A major reason for vitamin D deficiency in older people is limited sun exposure.9

Vitamin D synthesis is reduced in those who have dark skin due to the presence of melanin, which absorbs UV radiation.7 
People with dark skin are likely to need sun exposures 3–6 times longer than the times shown in Box 2. 
Vitamin D synthesis is also reduced by clothing,7,15,16 and people who wear covering clothing for cultural or religious reasons are an at-risk group. 
The sun avoidance behaviour of fair-skinned people increases their risk of vitamin D deficiency.11,17 
Reduced sun exposure is also likely to contribute to increased risk of vitamin D deficiency in people with chronic illness and those confined indoors. 
There is some evidence that sun exposure and vitamin D status may have separate roles in the development of disease.18

!!Dietary sources of vitamin D
Vitamin D3 is found naturally in small quantities in a few foods, such as wild-caught fatty fish (eg, North Sea salmon, herring, mackerel). Liver, eggs and fortified foods such as margarine and some low-fat milk products also contain very small amounts of vitamin D3. In Australia, there is one specially supplemented milk product with 200 IU (5 ?g) of vitamin D per 250 mL serve, and some mushrooms that have been exposed to UV radiation provide 800 IU (20 ?g) of vitamin D2 per 100 g.4 However, for most people, dietary vitamin D intake is limited.

Although accurate, comprehensive data on the vitamin D content of foods in Australasia are not available, vitamin D intake from dietary sources is likely to be insufficient to meet requirements, as the average estimated daily dietary intake for adults is only between 80 and 120 IU (2–3 ?g).19 This is considerably lower than in other countries (eg, Canada and the United States, where average intake ranges between 120 and 240 IU [3–6 ?g] per day) where more extensive vitamin D fortification of the food supply is mandated or permitted.20 It is acknowledged that the current (2006) guidelines for recommended dietary intakes (ie, adequate intakes) of vitamin D in Australia and New Zealand21 __are out of date__. The recently revised recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for vitamin D in the US are 600 IU (15 ?g) for people aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 ?g) for those aged ? 71 years, with an upper limit (that includes a generous safety factor) of 4000 IU (100 ?g).22

Effect of vitamin D on mineral metabolism, bone health and muscle function
The most clearly established effects of vitamin D are to maintain calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and to optimise bone health and muscle function.23-25 The hormonal form, 1,25-(OH)2D, increases active intestinal calcium (and phosphate) absorption, which helps offset obligatory calcium losses from the kidneys, gut and skin. Calcium concentrations in blood are maintained within narrow limits, so if inadequate calcium is absorbed from dietary sources, bone resorption increases under the influence of PTH, to maintain circulating calcium levels. Severe vitamin D deficiency causes impaired bone mineralisation, resulting in rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. There is Level II evidence that optimal mineral metabolism, bone density and muscle function is achieved at serum 25-OHD concentrations of 50–60 nmol/L,23-26 with no consistent evidence that higher levels are beneficial. Although most of these studies have been in older people, there is some evidence of improvement in bone mineral content from vitamin D supplementation in children and adolescents aged between 1 month and 20 years with low vitamin D levels (&amp;lt; 35 nmol/L).27 Further, a recent histomorphometric study of 675 German adults showed increased osteoid (unmineralised bone matrix) in some people with 25-OHD concentrations &amp;lt; 75 nmol/L, suggesting that this may be an appropriate cut-off for optimal bone health.28

Vitamin D deficiency is an independent predictor of falls in older people, and circulating 25-OHD levels &amp;lt; 60–75 nmol/L have been associated with lower-extremity muscle weakness and impaired balance, and accelerated losses in muscle mass, strength and physical function.25,29 A recent meta-analysis indicated that a minimum serum 25-OHD level of 60 nmol/L is required to effectively reduce the rate of falls,30 although this analysis has been disputed.22 Most Level I evidence indicates that vitamin D (at daily doses of &amp;gt; 800 IU [20 ?g]) needs to be combined with adequate calcium (&amp;gt; 1000 mg per day), rather than vitamin D alone, to reduce the risk of falls and fractures; although there may be benefits with single therapies.30-34 Therefore, older people would be recommended to consume adequate (1000–1300 mg per day) but not excessive dietary intakes of calcium, together with maintaining adequate vitamin D status (within the 25-OHD range 50–60 nmol/L, allowing for seasonal variation), to reduce risk of falls and fracture. This recommendation is consistent with the recent review conducted by the US Institute of Medicine that recommends a minimum serum level of 50 nmol/L, which can be achieved by meeting the RDA for vitamin D.22,35

!!Relationship of serum 25-OHD levels to disease
A wide range of diseases have been associated with low levels of circulating serum 25-OHD,4,13 including autoimmune diseases,36,37 cardiovascular and metabolic diseases,4,38-40 some cancers,41,42 microbial and respiratory diseases,4,43-45 and some neurological and mental health conditions 46-48 including schizophrenia,49 as well as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 50,51 (Box 4). Most of these studies were observational and did not adjust for important confounders. While there are studies in animal models that support the epidemiological evidence, and plausible mechanisms to explain the effects of vitamin D, there are very few randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of which have marked limitations, on which to base recommendations.39,41,44 Accordingly, proposals that recommend serum 25-OHD levels of 75–80 nmol/L or higher 56 are not supported by a significant amount of data from RCTs.22

Other epidemiological studies have recently provided Level III evidence of U-shaped exposure–risk relationships between serum 25-OHD levels and disease outcomes (ie, increased risk at both low [&amp;lt; 30 nmol/L] and high [&amp;gt; 75 or &amp;gt; 125 nmol/L] concentrations) for mortality,57,58 schizophrenia,49 prostate cancer,59 and frailty in women.60 These U-shaped curves may in part reflect a mixture of common genetic variants,61 but further RCTs are needed.

!!Other factors affecting vitamin D status
Vitamin D enters adipose tissue and may not be readily released, unless there is fat breakdown, so obesity results in lower vitamin D levels after receipt of oral or cutaneously synthesised vitamin D.12 Physical activity is a predictor of vitamin D status,62 which could be due to alteration in the storage and mobilisation of vitamin D in fat 63 or to greater exposure to sunlight when exercising. Polymorphisms in the genes for vitamin D-binding protein, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (which affects the amount of substrate 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin) and 25-hydroxylase may contribute as much to variation in 25-OHD levels as the summer–winter difference.61,64 The half-life of 25-OHD is long and, for reasons that are not entirely known, varies between 15 and 50 days.65 Some medications, such as cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, including some anticonvulsants, accelerate degradation of vitamin D compounds.66

One important factor is calcium intake, with low intakes of calcium or high levels of PTH (either primary or secondary) linked to accelerated degradation of 25-OHD and a shorter half-life.67 In contrast, increased dietary calcium intake leads to higher 25-OHD concentrations.68,69 Low calcium absorption may be the reason why people with malabsorption, or who undergo gastrectomy or related procedures,69 have reduced 25-OHD levels, as there is no evidence for clinically significant enterohepatic circulation of vitamin D compounds.70

!!Toxicity
The main concerns with excessive vitamin D levels are hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D toxicity can be caused by excess oral intake through supplementation, but not by prolonged exposure of the skin to sunlight, which produces 25-OHD values in the range 150–200 nmol/L.4,5,71 Hypercalcaemia is not seen until serum 25-OHD levels reach 220 nmol/L and is generally not reported until levels reach 500 nmol/L.71 There is no evidence of toxicity, based on blood calcium concentrations, at vitamin D doses up to 5000 IU per day or 50 000 IU per month.72-74

However, adverse effects can probably no longer be defined solely by hypercalcaemia, as a large RCT in older Australian women found that a single annual dose of 500 000 IU vitamin D3 for 3–5 years resulted in a 15% increase in falls and 26% increase in fractures.75 The increased risk of falls was pronounced in the first 3 months after taking the dose, and fracture risk also tended to be higher during this 3-month post-dose period, when serum 25-OHD levels would have been highest. Annual megadose vitamin D is thus not recommended, although a 5-year community study providing 100 000 IU (2500 ?g) of oral vitamin D3 every 4 months to older people did show benefits for fracture reduction.76 Furthermore, intramuscular administration of vitamin D (100 000 or 150 000 IU) may be appropriate in patients with malabsorption, although intramuscular preparations are not readily available in Australia. Administration of vitamin D is contraindicated in most cases of hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D treatment is not contraindicated in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency.77 Cod liver oil, which can be used for vitamin D supplementation, also contains vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses.

!!Serum 25-OHD status and target values
Based on our review of the available evidence, vitamin D status can be defined according to the following levels of serum 25-OHD:

!!Vitamin D adequacy: ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (level may need to be 10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer, to allow for seasonal decrease).
*Mild vitamin D deficiency: 30–49 nmol/L
*Moderate vitamin deficiency: 12.5–29 nmol/L
*Severe vitamin D deficiency: &amp;lt; 12.5 nmol/L
On the basis of the evidence discussed above, a target level for vitamin D adequacy for mineral homeostasis, bone health and muscle function would seem to be &amp;gt; 50 or 60 nmol/L,22,24 although optimal values, even for bone and muscle health, are not clear. Ideally, the target value should allow for a decrease in vitamin D levels during winter.17 An international consensus statement recently agreed on a 25-OHD serum concentration range between 50 and 62.5 nmol/L (20–25 ng/mL) to prevent adverse musculoskeletal outcomes, including falls and fractures.78 The target serum level for prevention of other diseases is not clear but may be higher, in the range of 75–80 nmol/L (30–32 ng/mL). However, there is currently limited high-level evidence to support these higher 25-OHD serum levels.56

Clinicians, researchers and policymakers should be aware of the imprecision of current 25-OHD testing, and exercise caution when interpreting results in clinical practice. Although the performance of radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked assays is acceptable, the bias and imprecision of many automated methods may be problematic at the lower, clinically and analytically important range (&amp;lt; 50 nmol/L) of the assay. While adoption and alignment of assays to the National Institute of Standards and Technology reference material should reduce bias,79 imprecision will remain problematic. Consequently, some laboratories are using more exacting methods of analysis, such as liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.79 All Australian and New Zealand laboratories offering 25-OHD testing are required to be enrolled in external proficiency programs (such as the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme [DEQAS]), which allow each laboratory to monitor its performance compared with its peers.

!!Supplemental vitamin D doses required to achieve targets
Some studies have shown that with supplemental vitamin D3, 25-OHD levels reach a plateau at about 8 weeks, after rising by, on average, about 0.7 nmol/L for each 40 IU (1 ?g) per day of supplemental vitamin D3 (ie, an increase of about 17 nmol/L for each 1000 IU [25 ?g] per day).73,80 However, at any given dose there is considerable individual variation in the plateau level achieved. Although the increment is negatively correlated to the baseline 25-OHD concentration, it is not significantly affected by race, sex or age.80,81 Obesity, however, is associated with lower levels of 25-OHD and a reduced dose response to oral vitamin D or UV radiation.7,12 As it may take up to 2–5 months for serum levels of 25-OHD to plateau,80,82 retesting should not take place before 3 months.

There appears to be little difference in 25-OHD values whether the total amount of vitamin D is given as a daily, weekly or monthly dose, with no clear indication that one dosing schedule is more effective than another. Intermittent dosing may be more convenient in some settings, such as nursing homes,83 and may also achieve better long-term compliance.73 There is conflicting evidence about whether vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D2 in raising 25-OHD levels,84,85 but virtually all oral vitamin D supplements available in Australia and New Zealand are vitamin D3. There are currently no generally available, Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved parenteral preparations of vitamin D, although these might be helpful where ability to swallow, malabsorption or compliance are problems.

Recommendations for assessment and management of vitamin D deficiency are shown in Box 5. To treat moderate to severe deficiency, it would be reasonable to use 3000–5000 IU (75–125 ?g) of vitamin D per day for at least 6–12 weeks, although there are no long-term safety data for these doses. This will usually return serum 25-OHD levels to the target range, although smaller daily doses of 2000 IU might be expected to increase 25-OHD levels by 34 nmol/L, as noted earlier. As there is such an individual variation of response to vitamin D supplementation, 25-OHD levels should be checked after 3 months. If adequate levels are not achieved, consideration should be given to possible underlying gastrointestinal disorders, such as coeliac disease. Most patients whose 25-OHD levels have normalised will need ongoing treatment at a maintenance dose of around 1000–2000 IU (25–50 ?g) per day or equivalent.

For adults in disadvantaged communities at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as dark-skinned migrants from low socioeconomic backgrounds, a strong case could be made to routinely provide vitamin D supplements, at the same dose used to treat moderate to severe deficiency, as early as possible, without initially measuring serum 25-OHD levels. As low calcium intake and associated hyperparathyroidism increase the degradation of vitamin D compounds,67,69,84 a daily intake of 1000–1300 mg of calcium, preferably from calcium-rich foods, should be encouraged.

According to the best evidence currently available, adequate serum 25-OHD levels of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer to allow for a seasonal decrease), along with recommended dietary calcium intakes and weight-bearing or muscle strengthening exercise, are required for optimal bone and muscle function, at least in older age groups. Although it is likely that serum 25-OHD levels that are somewhat higher than those required for musculoskeletal health play a small role in prevention of some disease states, there is evidence emerging of potential adverse effects of higher serum 25-OHD levels under some circumstances. RCTs to test these hypotheses need to be undertaken before higher targets can be recommended with confidence.

!Box 1 – Position statement development process
This position statement was developed by a Working Group (joint Chairs, C N and R M) commissioned by the Australian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society (ANZBMS) and Osteoporosis Australia (OA). All members of the Working Group have published extensively in the field of vitamin D. Specific expertise includes: nutrition (C N, K S), brain (J M), endocrinology (P E, A H, R M), exercise (R D), measurement (M S) and sunlight exposure (R M).

The Working Group prepared an initial evidence-based draft statement that was circulated to senior colleagues in clinical bone research in Australia for comment. The statement was subsequently modified, and all members of the ANZBMS and Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) were notified by email that a draft statement had been posted on the ANZBMS website for widespread comment and feedback. Suggested revisions were incorporated with consensus from the Working Group. The medical and scientific affairs committees of the ANZBMS, OA and ESA reviewed the final manuscript. This edited version of the full position statement has been reviewed by all members of the Working Group and senior representatives of ANZBMS, OA and ESA.

+followed by ongoing treatment with a lower dose of around 1000–2000 IU per day 
+(eg, 3–5 × 1000 IU vitamin D3 capsules per day or 0.6–1 mL of 5000 IU/mL liquid vitamin D3 for 6–12 weeks, followed by 1 capsule of 1000 IU or 0.2 mL of 5000 IU/mL liquid per day) 
+and adequate calcium intake
*An alternative is 50 000 IU vitamin D3 (eg, Calciferol Strong, API Consumer Brands, New Zealand only), 1 tablet, once per month for 3–6 months 74*
*Most patients will need ongoing treatment with a lower dose (eg, 1000 IU per day or equivalent)
* Monthly dosing is similarly effective and apparently safe but takes 3–5 months for plateau 25-OHD levels to be reached.
