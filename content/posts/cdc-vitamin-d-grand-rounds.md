# Groups at Risk of Vitamin D Deficiency

Breastfed infants

Older adults

People with limited sun exposure

People with dark skin

People with fat malabsorption

People who are obese or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery

## <span style="color:#C00;">Note from video: Inverse care law for medicine = Those who need it the most get it the least</span>

# New Blood tests have <8% day-to-day variation

Isotope Dilution Tandem Mass Spectrometry Coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC-MS/MS)

 **Precision  <8% day-to-day variation**  [CLICK HERE to see other references on vitamin D blood testing](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=24)

# Findings from the Second Systematic Review

Infant growth: Most studies found no effect

Cardiovascular disease

– Randomized controlled trials: No effect

– Cohort studies: Variable association

Randomized controlled trials: No effect

Cohort studies: Variable association

Body weight: No effect

Cancer: No effect

Infectious diseases: No effect

Pregnancy outcomes: Inadequate data

All-cause mortality: Inconsistent data

Hypertension: Inconsistent data

# Women’s Health Initiative

NIH-sponsored: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi

Largest intervention trial in history: >160,000 women

One of the substudies randomized women to vitamin D and calcium for a 7– year period to examine potential effects on hip fractures

www.nhlbi.nih.gov/whi

## Trial Results after 7 Years

Hip fractures: 12% decrease, not significant

– 21% decrease for women aged 60-80 years at baseline

– 29% decrease among women who took 80% of pills

 **Note: WHI only used 400 IU**   [CLICK HERE for many other studies which DID find a significant difference](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=5)

Improved hip bone density

Other fractures: No differences self-reported vertebral, lower arm/wrist, total)

Kidney stones

– Significantly increased 17% (5 per 10,000/year)

 **Note: WHI used too much Calcium** 

# Recommendations Made by Professional Groups

American Academy of Pediatrics 400 IU for children

Canadian Paediatric Society 

– Weight-based intake for children

– Up to 2000 IU for pregnant and lactating women

American Academy of Dermatology

– More from supplements, not more sun exposure

National Osteoporosis Foundation, International Osteoporosis Foundation

-400-800 IU for adults <50 years; 800-1000 IU >50 years

# Notes from video question and answer section

Not noticing relationship between rates of osteo nor Cancer with decreases in vitamin D

PTH suppression - at 20 ng or 30 ng?

# Deficiency definitions have strong impact on determining what percentage of the population is deficient

## Definitions in ng/ml are  **<span style="color:#6C6;">11</span>, <span style="color:#00F;">20</span>, and <span style="color:#90C;">32</span>**
