Introduction: Respiratory distress (RD) is the most common cause of admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The role of Vitamin D in the development and fortification of fetal pulmonary architecture and the synthesis of surfactants is well-documented. While different serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (Vit. D) have been studied for their diagnostic significance in RD, there is limited research on how it specifically affects the development of respiratory problems in infants and their mothers. The purpose of the present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the correlation between serum levels of Vit. D in mothers and newborns with RD, and to determine the impact of treating either population on the clinical outcomes of afflicted infants.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across various databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, ISI, and Google Scholar, using a combination of keywords such as RD, diagnosis, vitamin D, mothers, infants, vitamin D supplementation, Respiratory distress syndrome(RDS), and Transient Tachypnea of Newborn (TTN). The search was carried out until March 2024.The level of vitamin D in both mothers and their infants was systematically extracted and analyzed to determine the diagnostic efficacy of Vit. D levels. The mean difference (MD) was calculated along with a 95% confidence interval to determine the association between the Vit. D levels in newborns and their mothers and the likelihood of RD, RDS and TTN in infants. To assess potential publication bias, a funnel plot was generated and Egger's regression test was applied, utilizing a random-effects model.

Results: Initially a total of 298 relevant articles was retrieved. Among them, 17 articles with a total of 1,582 infants (745 cases and 837 healthy controls) met the criteria as eligible studies. Of these six were prospective cohort studies, four retrospective case-control studies, four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and three descriptive-analytical studies. The meta-results revealed a significant association between Vit. D levels and risk of RD in infants (MD = 6.240, 95 %CI: 4.840-7.840, P < 0.001) and mothers (MD = 8.053, 95 %CI: 4.920-11.186, P < 0.001). Furthermore, a strong association was found for risk of RDS (MD = 5.493, 95 %CI: 3.356-7.631, P < 0.001) in infants and TTN (MD = 6.672, 95 %CI: 4.072-9.272, P < 0.001), (MD = 8.595, 95%CI: 4.604-12.586, P < 0.001) both in infants and mothers. 

Administering 50,000 units of vitamin D to mothers (MD = 8.595, 95 %CI: 4.604-12.586, P < 0.001) prior to childbirth was observed to reduce the likelihood of RD in newborns by 64 % (RR = 0.36, 95 %CI: 0.23-0.57, P < 0.001). Supplemental vitamin D provided to infants was associated with several clinical benefits.

Conclusion: Our meta-results indicated a significant correlation between serum levels of Vit. D and the risk of RD, RDS and TTN in infants. Prophylactic maternal administration of vitamin D plays a protective role against neonatal RD. Additionally, providing vitamin D to premature infants has shown a significant impact in reducing the incidence of respiratory complications.
