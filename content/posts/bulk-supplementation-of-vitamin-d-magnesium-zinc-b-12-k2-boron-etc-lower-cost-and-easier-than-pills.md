I experimented with bulk supplements from about 2015 to 2020.  

Problems with the process

1. Had to put the bulk powder into pills to escape the Magnesium sour taste

1. It did not allow my taking the water-soluble form of 4 of the supplements

1. It took too much effort each month to grind the supplements and make the pills

#### Neat features of bulk supplementation

1. Nothing to have to remember to take daily

1. Far lower cost than pills ($0.18/day + Omega-3)

1. Much easier to supplement for those who dislike or are unused to taking pills

1. Takes about 20 minutes to prepare for 10 days = 12 hours for preparation/year

1. Great for families having a variety of weights - the dose size is proportional to a person's weight.

   * Also needed to re-mix the supplements before adding to granola - it appears to cake-up after a month
