[Significant Differences in Fecal Microbiota Are Associated with Various Stages of Glucose Tolerance in African-American Male Veterans](https://endo.confex.com/endo/2015endo/webprogram/Paper21179.html)

 **African American men divided into 4 groups** 

1. stable glucose tolerance,

1. stable impaired fasting glucose 

> or stable impaired glucose tolerance,

1. worsened glucose tolerance

1. improved glucose tolerance.

There were significant differences in bacterial composition between the first and second groups (P=0.03) at the phylum level. Bacteroidetes was higher and Firmicutes was lower with worse glycemic control in the second group. 

The Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio was 1.9 versus 0.9 in group 1 and 2 (P=0.01) and 1.9 versus 1.1 in group 1 and 3 (P=0.04).

Proteobacteria decreased over the period in groups 2 and 4 compared to group 1 (P=0.04 for both).

At the family and genus levels, in group 2 versus group 1 there was less Prevotella, and a higher Bacteroides/Prevotella ratio in the second group at 5.6 to 2.7 (P=0.05). There was also less Enterobacteriacea (P=0.03), and more Ruminococcae (P=0.01) and Veillonelacea (P=0.02).

"We speculate that lower abundance of Prevotella may be associated with worsening glycemia, and conversely higher abundance of Akkermansia might be associated with improving glycemia, thus corroborating suggestions from previous studies,"
