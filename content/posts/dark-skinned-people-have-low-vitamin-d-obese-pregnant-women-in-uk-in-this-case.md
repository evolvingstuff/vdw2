#### Vitamin D status of pregnant women with obesity in the UK and its association with pregnancy outcomes: a secondary analysis of the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) study

Prenatal vitamin D deficiency is widely reported and may affect perinatal outcomes. In this secondary analysis of the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial, we examined vitamin D status and its relationship with selected pregnancy outcomes in women with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) from multi-ethnic inner-city settings in the UK. Determinants of vitamin D status at a mean of 17 ± 1 weeks' gestation were assessed using multivariable linear regression and reported as percent differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). Associations between 25(OH)D and clinical outcomes were examined using logistic regression. Among 1089 participants, 67 % had 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l and 26 % had concentrations < 25 nmol/l. In fully adjusted models accounting for socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics, 25(OH)D was lower among women of Black (% difference = -33; 95 % CI: -39, -27), Asian (% difference = -43; 95 % CI: -51, -35) and other non-White (% difference = -26; 95 % CI: -35, -14) ethnicity compared with women of White ethnicity (n 1086; P < 0·001 for all). In unadjusted analysis, risk of gestational diabetes was greater in women with 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/l compared with ≥ 50 nmol/l (OR = 1·58; 95 % CI: 1·09, 2·31), but the magnitude of effect estimates was attenuated in the multivariable model (OR = 1·33; 95 % CI: 0·88, 2·00). There were no associations between 25(OH)D and risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth or small for gestational age or large-for-gestational-age delivery. These findings demonstrate low 25(OH)D among pregnant women with obesity and highlight ethnic disparities in vitamin D status in the UK. However, evidence for a greater risk of adverse perinatal outcomes among women with vitamin D deficiency was limited.
