To date, the precise etiology of molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is uncertain. Vitamin D plays a key role in hard tissue formation. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) status and dental health data obtained from 1,048 children in a 10-year follow-up of the Munich GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts. The dental examination included the diagnosis of MIH and recording of (non-)cavitated caries lesions in primary and permanent teeth. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were taken from blood samples of the 10-year investigation and measured with a fully automated, modular system. Different logistic regression and Poisson hurdle models were calculated. MIH was diagnosed in 13.6% of the study population. Approximately 16.4% of the children demonstrated caries-related defects (D3-4MFS > 0). The mean season-adjusted concentration of 25(OH)D was 75.8 nmol/l (standard deviation 22.0 nmol/l). 

After adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, parental education, equivalent income, and television/personal computer (TV/PC) viewing hours, a  **10 nmol/l** increase in serum 25(OH)D concentrations was significantly associated with a lower odds ratio of having MIH ( **OR = 0.89** ; P = 0.006). Furthermore, higher 25(OH)D values were associated with a lower number of caries-affected permanent teeth. It is concluded that elevated serum 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with better dental health parameters.

* Taking vitamin D supplements resulted in a 47% reduced rate of dental caries.

* Taking vitamin D supplements had no effect on caries in those older than 13 years old, especially in girls.

* Dental caries are more common in late winter and early spring, which is when vitamin D levels tend to be lower.

* Children with severe ECC have lower vitamin D levels compared to children without caries.

* Mothers with low vitamin D levels are more likely to give birth to children who develop dental caries.

* Vitamin D supplementation may help reduce the risk of developing dental caries.
