# Wondering how people used to get vitamin D in the winter

## Note: It appears that no vitamin D from the sun when 40 degrees away from equator in the winter.

* Burn the fat & vitamin D in the body which had been added with summer feasting

   * Winters were times of famine/fasting - and burning of fat and retrieving vitamin D stored in the fat

* Campfires? - some small amount of vitamin D

* Dried fish?

* Lard and many game meats had lots of vitamin D - which could be consumed in the winter

## Since flame detectors sometimes monitor UV there must be some UV in a fire - perhaps enough to generate some vitamin D

## Wonder about animals in the Northern Winters

* Do birds migrate South in the winter to get food AND vitamin D?

* Do mammals which do not migrate (deer, rabbits,...) store vitamin D in fat and body tissue long enough to get to Spring?

* Do mammals which burn fat during hibernation ([bears](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0021483), ground squirrels, ...) get vitamin D from their fat as well?

   * Interesting: Vitamin D2 in bears is higher in winter than in summer

* Some animals eat dried grass in the winter

* Many animals (which do not migrate) add fat in the summer - when vitamin D happens to be available

## Humans unfortunately typically add fat in the winter - when vitamin D is usually NOT available

## This gives one possible reason that evolution (in humans and many animals) caused the storing of vitamin D in fat

## Burning fat for energy during the winter also releases vitamin D
