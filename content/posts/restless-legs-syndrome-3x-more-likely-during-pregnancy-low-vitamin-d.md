Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder that may be associated with pregnancy. Studies have found that the prevalence of RLS among pregnant women ranged from 10 to 34%. Typically, there is complete remission of symptoms soon after parturition; however, in some patients, they may continue postpartum. 

RLS has been shown to be associated with a number of complications in pregnancy including 

* preeclampsia and 

* increased incidence of Cesarean sections. 

Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, each individual hypothesis cannot completely explain the whole pathogenesis. Present understanding suggests that a 

* strong family history, 

*  **low serum iron and ferritin level** , and 

* high estrogen level during pregnancy might play important roles. 

*  **Vitamin D deficiency**  and calcium metabolism may also play a role. 

Medical treatment of RLS during pregnancy is difficult and challenging considering the risks to mother and fetus. However, in some cases, the disease may be severe enough to require treatment.

 **The study says** 

Pregnant women with RLS reported more complications related to pregnancy and labor such as 

* threatened abortion,

* premature labor, 

* difﬁcult delivery, and 

* intrauterine growth retardation;
