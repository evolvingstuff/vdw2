<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/von-helden-english.jpg" alt="image" width="900">** Foreword 7 (Shortened) **I had to write this book about vitamin D activation because

* only the activation of vitamin D causes the healing effects,

* despite the many books on vitamin D, this central aspect of activation has remained unknown,

* different successes of vitamin D therapy are due to the lack of activation,

* The four methods of vitamin D activation not only protect ourselves, but also our climate and nature.

I recommend reading to all people who want to help their fellow human beings, their families, themselves and our planet through the power of nature.
