<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/stroke-mortality-pa-and-d.webp alt=image width=500><p>Background: 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations and physical activity (PA) are linked and both are associated with changes in mortality. We examined the association of 25(OH)D and PA with all-cause or cause-specific mortality risk in stroke survivors.</p><p>Methods: The analysis included 677 stroke survivors from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2008 to 2017-2018. Independent and joint associations of 25(OH)D, PA and mortality among stroke survivors were analyzed using weighted Cox regression.</p><p>Results: We identified 133 all-cause deaths <span>[major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 34; non-MACE, 79]</span> with a median follow-up of 5.8 years (interquartile, 2.8-8.9 years). In a range of adjusted models, high 25(OH)D was observed with lower all-cause mortality compared to low 25(OH)D (HR, 0.376; 95% CI, 0.233-0.607) and non-MACE (HR, 0.265; 95% CI, 0.143-0.490) mortality was consistently associated. At the same time, compared with no PA, PA was associated with a lower all-cause (HR, 0.280; 95%CI, 0.107-0.733) and non-MACE (HR, 0.266; 95%CI, 0.087-0.810) was associated with a lower risk of death. In addition, pooled analyses showed that stroke survivors with high 25(OH)D and PA had the lowest risk of all-cause death (HR, 0.132; 95%CI, 0.038-0.460) and non-MACE (HR, 0.092; 95%CI, 0.023-0.363), there is an additive interaction between 25(OH)D and PA in non-MACE.</p><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, this study found that combining high 25(OH)D levels and PA showed an enhanced protective effect which demonstrated a synergistic effect between them in reducing mortality among stroke survivors. These findings provide new ideas and possibilities for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, offering a reference for development of clinical practice guidelines in the future.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/stroke-mortality-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=google-scholar-had-184000-hits-for-stroke-and-vitamin-d-as-of-oct-2024>Google Scholar had 184,000 hits for Stroke AND Vitamin D as of Oct 2024</h4><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=stroke+%22vitamin+d%22&amp;btnG=">Google Scholar</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of the linkage between low vitamin D and the risk as well as the prognosis of stroke - June 2024 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.3577>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Association between Vitamin D and Short-Term Functional Outcomes in Acute Ischemic Stroke - Nov 2023 - <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15234957>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>A systematic review examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on functional outcomes post-stroke - May 2023 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/02692155231174599>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>The relationship of vitamin D deficiency with severity and outcome of acute stroke - Dec 2021 [FREE PDF](<a href=https://doi.org/10.2478/rjim-2021-0013%20>https://doi.org/10.2478/rjim-2021-0013%20</a>)</p></li><li><p>Low vitamin D levels and the long-term functional outcome of stroke up to 5 years - Sept 2021 <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/stroke-up-to-5-years.pdf>PDF attached</a></p></li><li><p>Does vitamin D administration play a role in outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke?

We aimed to examine this association in a prospective study in women and to summarize all existing data in a meta-analysis.</p><p>Methods—We measured 25(OH)D levels among 464 women who developed ischemic stroke and an equal number of control subjects who were free of stroke through 2006 in the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study (NHS). We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles published through March 2011 that prospectively evaluated 25(OH)D levels in relation to stroke.</p><p>Results—After multivariable adjustment for lifestyle and dietary covariates, lower 25(OH)D levels were associated with an elevated risk of ischemic stroke in the NHS: the OR (95% CI) comparing women in the lowest versus highest tertiles was 1.49 (1.01–2.18; Ptrend=0.04). We found 6 other prospective studies that examined 25(OH)D in relation to stroke outcomes. After pooling our results with these prospective studies that included 1214 stroke cases in total, low 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of developing stroke outcomes in comparison to high levels: the pooled relative risk (95% CI) was <strong>1.52</strong> (1.20–1.85; I2=0.0%, Pheterogeneity=0.63). In 2 studies that explicitly examined ischemic stroke, this association was <strong>1.59</strong> (1.07–2.12; I2=0.0%, Pheterogeneity=0.80).</p><p>Conclusions—These data provide evidence that low vitamin D levels are modestly associated with risk of stroke.</p><p>Maintaining adequate vitamin D status may lower the risk of stroke in women.</p><h4 id=hypertension-blood-pressure-increases-incidence-of-strokes>Hypertension (blood pressure) increases incidence of strokes</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/overview-hypertension-and-vitamin-d>Overview Hypertension and vitamin D</a> at VitaminDWki</p></li><li><p><a href=http://highbloodpressure.about.com/od/associatedproblems/p/stroke_pro.htm>About.com</a></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>70% of strokes related to high blood pressure</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;High blood pressure is the single most important controllable stroke risk factor, especially in the elderly.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=strokes-occur-25-more-often-in-the-spring---when-the-vitamin-d-blood-levels-are-the-lowest>Strokes occur 25% more often in the Spring - when the vitamin D blood levels are the lowest</h4><p><strong>Incidence of Stroke and Season of the Year: Evidence of an Association</strong></p><p>Am J Epidemiol 2000;152:558–64.</p><p>Evidence of seasonal variation in the incidence of stroke is inconsistent.

We identified risk factors, and clinical or molecular biomarkers that could be therapeutic targets for wake-up stroke prevention, thus hopefully leading to a decrease in its mortality and disability in medium to long-term outcome.</p><p>Methods: 4251 ischemic stroke (IS) patients from a prospectively registered database were recruited; 3838 (90.3%) had known onset-symptom time, and 413 (9.7%) were wake-up strokes. The main endpoint was to analyze the association between different serum biomarkers with wake-up IS episodes and their progression. Leukocytes count, serum levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and vitamin D were analyzed as inflammation biomarkers; N-terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic-Peptide and microalbuminuria, used as atrial/endothelial dysfunction biomarkers; finally, glutamate levels as excitotoxicity biomarker. In addition, demographic, clinical and neuroimaging variables associated with the time-evolution of wake-up IS patients and functional outcome at 3 months were evaluated. Good and poor functional outcome were defined as mRS ≤2 and mRS > 2 at 3 months, respectively.</p><p>Results: Wake-up IS showed a poorer outcome at 3-months than in patients with known on-set-symptom time (59.1% vs. 48.1%; p &lt; 0.0001). Patients with wake-up IS had higher levels of inflammation biomarkers; IL-6 levels at admission (51.5 ± 15.1 vs. 27.8 ± 18.6 pg/ml; p &lt; 0.0001), and low vitamin D levels at 24 h (5.6 ± 5.8 vs. 19.2 ± 9.4 ng/ml; p &lt; 0.0001) are worthy of attention. In a logistic regression model adjusted for vitamin D, OR was 15.1; CI 95%: 8.6-26.3, p &lt; 0.0001. However, we found no difference in vitamin D levels between patients with or without clinical-DWI mismatch (no: 18.95 ± 9.66; yes: 17.84 ± 11.77 ng/mL, p = 0.394). No difference in DWI volume at admission was found (49.3 ± 96.9 ml in wake-up IS patients vs. 51.7 ± 98.2 ml in awake IS patients; p = 0.895).</p><p>Conclusions: Inflammatory biomarkers are the main factors that are strongly associated with wake-up IS episodes. Wake-up IS is associated with lower vitamin D levels. These data indicate that vitamin D deficiency could become a therapeutic target to reduce wake-up IS events.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/stroke-while-asleep.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=stroke-is-more-severe-and-disabling-if-vitamin-d-is-lower---april-2021>Stroke is more severe and disabling if vitamin D is lower - April 2021</h4><p><strong>The Relationship of Vitamin D Deficiency with Severity and Outcome of Acute Stroke</strong></p><p>Rom J Intern Med. 2021 Apr 13. <a href=https://doi.org/10.2478/rjim-2021-0013>doi: 10.2478/rjim-2021-0013</a></p><p>Reza Ebrahimi Rad 1, Mohammadreza Zarbakhsh 2, Samira Sarabi 3</p><p>Background: There are currently conflicting results regarding the link between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk for stroke and its poor prognosis. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and prognosis of acute stroke.</p><p>Methods: This bi-center cross-sectional study was performed on 140 consecutive patients who referred to two general hospitals in Iran with the diagnosis of acute stroke. The levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D were evaluated by Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique. Clinical severity of stroke on admission as well as on discharge time were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or Modified Rankin (mRS) tools.</p><p>Results: Mean serum level of vitamin D was 25.51 ± 18.87 ng/mL, ranging from 3.0 to 98.6 ng/ml. There was a significant difference between the two groups (with and without vitamin D deficiency) in terms of stroke severity and disability, as reflected by mRS (P=0.003) and NIHSS evaluation (14.24 ± 9.23 versus 9.73 ± 7.36, P=0.003). Also, regarding patients&rsquo; clinical condition, the mean NIHSS score in those with deficient and normal levels of vitamin D was 14.24 ± 9.23 and 9.73 ± 7.36, respectively with NIHSS score > 5 in 76.1% and 61.5%, respectively (P = 0.003).</p><p>Conclusion: According to the results of study, vitamin D status can be related to the severity of stroke. However, considering the cross-sectional design of our study, it could not point out the causality between vitamin D deficiency and acute stroke and further studies are warranted. It is not possible to draw any conclusions in terms of causality. Further studies are required in order to assess the relationship between the serum vitamin D levels and stroke severity.</p><hr><h4 id=4x-more-likely-to-have-a-good-function-after-a-stroke-if-have-a-high-vitamin-d-level---may-2014>4X more likely to have a good function after a stroke if have a high vitamin D level - May 2014</h4><p><strong>Prognostic Value of Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in Patients with Stroke.</strong></p><p>Neurochem Res. 2014 May 1.</p><p>Wang Y1, Ji H, Tong Y, Zhang ZB.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/stroke-2014.jpg alt=image width=400><p>We aimed to evaluate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> levels and both clinical severity at admission and outcome at discharge in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). From June 2012 to October 2013, consecutive first-ever AIS patients admitted to the Department of Emergency of The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, China were identified. Clinical information was collected. Serum 25(OH) D levels were measured at baseline. Stroke severity was assessed at admission using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Functional outcome was evaluated at discharge using the modified Rankin scale (m-Rankin). Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models. During the study period, 326 patients were diagnosed as AIS and were included in the analysis. Serum 25(OH) D levels reduced with increasing severity of stroke as defined by the NIHSS score. There was a negative correlation between levels of 25(OH) D and the NIHSS (r = - 0.389, P = 0.000). In multivariate analyses, serum 25(OH) D level was an independent prognostic marker of discharge favorable functional outcome and survival <span>[odds ratio 3.96 (2.85-7.87) and 3.36 (2.12-7.08), respectively, P = 0.000 for both, adjusted for NHISS, other predictors and vascular risk factors]</span> in patients with AIS. Serum 25(OH) D levels are a predictor of both severity at admission and favorable functional outcome in patients with AIS.

While there are various nutritional options for the natural intake of vitamin D, we hope to elucidate the potential mechanisms dietary vitamin D may play in hemorrhagic stroke pathology. This scoping review outlines findings from studies relevant to the biochemical activity of vitamin D, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on hemorrhagic stroke outcomes, and the potential benefit of nutritional vitamin D on hemorrhagic stroke outcomes. Here, we analyze the relevant factors that can lead to vitamin D deficiency, and subsequently, a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke incidence with worsened subsequent outcomes.</p><p>The neuroprotective mechanisms through which vitamin D works to attenuate hemorrhagic stroke onset and post-stroke outcomes have not yet been thoroughly examined.</p><p>However, researchers have proposed several potential protective mechanisms, including</p><ul><li><p>reduction of blood brain barrier disturbance by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species,</p></li><li><p>mitigation of inflammation through a reduction of levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and</p></li><li><p>prevention of cerebral vasospasm and</p></li><li><p>delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage.</p></li></ul><p>While more research is needed and there are limitations to vitamin D supplementation, vitamin D as a whole may play a significant role in the dynamics of hemorrhagic stroke. Further research should focus on expanding our understanding of the neuroprotective capacity and mechanisms of vitamin D, as well as how vitamin D supplementation could serve as an effective course of treatment of hemorrhagic strokes.</p><hr><h4 id=quick-review-of-hemorrhagic-stroke---june-2017>Quick review of Hemorrhagic Stroke - June 2017</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D - maybe, Vitamin C - maybe, Cholesterol - maybe, Omega-3 - YES</strong></p><ul><li>There has been some Hemorrhagic Stroke research: <a href=https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/aje/kwp227>https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/aje/kwp227</a></li></ul><blockquote><p>There was not enough data to show that vitamin D was significant - but the trend indicated a 40% reduction</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22627988>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22627988</a> PDF online</li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;We found no significant associations between dietary vitamin D and hemorrhagic stroke.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/underreported-dangers-low-cholesterol?>How LOW Cholesterol Can Harm Your Health</a> Green Medical Information, Sept 2012</li></ul><blockquote><p>Cholesterol Is Needed To Prevent Hemorrhagic Stroke:</p></blockquote><ul><li>The Role of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Stroke - 2016</li></ul><blockquote><p><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/omega-3-and-stroke.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></p></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href="http://www.lifeextension.com/Newsletter/2015/3/Decreased-levels-of-the-omega-3-fatty-acid-EPA-associated-risk-intracerebral-hemorrhage/Page-01?utm_source=eNewsletter_EZX500E&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Article&amp;utm_content=Button&amp;utm_campaign=2015Wk12">Omega-3 and vitamin C both PREVENT Hemorrhagic Stroke</a>- Life Extension 2015</p></li><li><p><a href=http://nethealthbook.com/news/omega-3-good-after-heart-attacks-and-for-hemorrhagic-stroke-prevention/>Omega-3 Good After Heart Attacks And For Hemorrhagic Stroke Prevention</a> 2015</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=2-studies-of-hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-with-vitamin-d---july-2024>2 studies of Hemorrhagic stroke treatment with Vitamin D - July 2024</h4><ul><li><p>Nutritional Supplementation of Naturally Occurring Vitamin D to Improve Hemorrhagic Stroke Outcomes - July 2021 <a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.670245>FREE PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Vitamin D Enhances Hematoma Clearance and Neurologic Recovery in Intracerebral Hemorrhage - May 2022 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.037769>FREE PDF</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=stroke-prevention-guidelines---80-of-strokes-can-be-prevented-vitamin-d-ignored---oct-2024>Stroke prevention guidelines - 80% of strokes can be prevented, Vitamin D ignored - Oct 2024</h4><p><strong>2024 Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke: A Guideline From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/stoke-guidelines---80-preventable-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1750249976"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1750249976",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1750249976"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1750249976"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1750249976"></script></body></html>
