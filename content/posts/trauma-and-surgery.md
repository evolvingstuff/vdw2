#### High Dose Vitamin D in the (COVID) ICU - video May 2023

 **[Dr. Eduardo Beltran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0aKls6AbME&ab_channel=Dr.EduardoBeltran)** 

In this video, we shall talk about HLD (600K IU of vitamin D3) that was used in the intensive care unit (Brazil & Bolivia) used in patients who were diagnosed with SCV-2. Patients received their D3 via an NG tube while being intubated and connected to a ventilator. 26 out of 28 patients survived. The results speak for themselves.
