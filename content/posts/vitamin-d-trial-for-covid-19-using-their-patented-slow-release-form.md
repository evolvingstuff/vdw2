OPKO patented a slow release form of Vitamin D to treat Chronic Kidney Disease in 2014

It is extremely expensive, and now the company hopes to show that it fight COVID-19

Standard, far lower cost, over-the-counter vitamin D would be better, but Vitamin D would not profit the company

Note: The trial is comparing the product against a placebo, not against vitamin D
