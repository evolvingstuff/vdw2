This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on HT through a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</p><p>Methods: The databases searched included PubMed, and others. We included RCTs that the treatment group received vitamin D, while the control group received either a placebo or no treatment. The studies measured the baseline and endpoint levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), and thyroglobulin antibody (TG-Ab). We performed a meta-analysis to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).</p><p>Results: A total of 12 studies involving 862 individuals were included. Vitamin D supplementation has a significant impact on reducing the titers of TPO-Ab (SMD = -1.084, 95% CI = -1.624 to -0.545) and TG-Ab (SMD = -0.996, 95% CI = -1.579 to -0.413) in patients with HT, and it also improves thyroid function by decreasing TSH level (SMD = -0.167, 95% CI = -0.302 to 0.031) and increasing FT3 (SMD = 0.549, 95% CI = 0.077-1.020) and FT4 (SMD = 0.734, 95% CI = 0.184-1.285) levels. Active vitamin D (calcitriol) significantly reduces the titer of TPO-Ab compared to naive forms of vitamin D (vitamin D2 or D3); treatment durations > 12 weeks result in a more effective reduction of TPO-Ab levels and a more significant increase in FT4 and FT3 levels in patients with HT (meta-regression P &lt; .05).</p><p>Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation may have beneficial effects on HT patients by modulating immune responses and improving thyroid function.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/hashimoto-s-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=hashimotos-thyroiditis-and-vitamin-d---meta-analysis---dec-2021>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and vitamin D - meta-analysis - Dec 2021</h4><p><strong>Effects of vitamin D on thyroid autoimmunity markers in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: systematic review and meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Jingwen Zhang, Yuting Chen, <span>[…]</span>, and Hong Li <a href=mailto:shanhong_li@126.com>shanhong_li@126.com</a></p><p>Journal of international Medical Research <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211060675>FREE PDF</a></p><p>Objective</p><p>To perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on thyroid autoimmunity markers in Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT).</p><p>Methods</p><p>This meta-analysis included randomized controlled clinical trials identified by a systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed®, MEDLINE®, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure) from inception to August 2020.

Among these patients, 186 <strong>(85.3%) had vitamin D deficiency defined as serum 25(OH)D levels &lt; 30 ng/mL.</strong> The mean age of all these 218 HT patients was 35.3 ± 8.5 years. The mean age of the 186 vitamin D deficient HT patients (173 females and 13 males) was 37.3 ± 5.6 years. The 186 vitamin D deficient HT patients received vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, CF) orally, <strong>1200-4000 IU, every day for 4 months</strong> aiming to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 40 ng/mL. Anthropometric characteristics (height, weight, waist circumference), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum concentration of 25(OH)D, thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), antithyroglobulin (anti-TG), calcium and phosphorus levels and thyroid and kidney sonographic findings were recorded and measured before and after CF administration.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>There was a significant negative correlation only between serum 25(OH)D levels and anti-TPO levels among all 218 HT patients. Also, anti-TPO levels were significantly higher in 186/218 vitamin D deficient HT patients compared to 32/218 HT patients with no vitamin D deficiency (364 ± 181IU/mL versus 115.8 ± 37.1IU/mL, P&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Supplementation of CF in 186 vitamin D deficient HT patients caused a significant decrease (20.3%) in serum anti-TPO levels.</p><p>Although at the end of the 4 months period of the study body mass index (BMI), serum anti-TG and TSH levels decreased by 2.2%, 5.3% and 4% respectively, these differences were not significant.</p><p>No changes in the sonographic findings were observed.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>The majority (85.3%) of the Greek Caucasian patients with HT studied who lived and worked in Crete had low serum 25(OH)D levels inversely correlated with serum anti-TPO thyroid antibodies. After 4 months of CF supplementation in the 186 HT patients with vitamin D deficiency, a significant decrease (20.3%) of serum anti-TPO levels was found. These findings suggest that vitamin D deficiency may be related to pathogenesis of HT and that its supplementation could contribute to the treatment of patients with HT.</p><p>PMID: 26637501</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ht-treated-by-vitamin-d.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=hashimotos-thyroiditis-23x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d---june-2015>Hashimoto&rsquo;s Thyroiditis 2.3X more likely if low vitamin D - June 2015</h4><p>J Clin Res Pediatr Endocrinol. 2015 Jun 5;7(2):128-33. <a href=https://doi.org/10.4274/jcrpe.2011.>doi: 10.4274/jcrpe.2011.</a></p><p><strong>Vitamin D Deficiency and Hashimoto&rsquo;s Thyroiditis in Children and Adolescents: a Critical Vitamin D Level for This Association?</strong></p><p>Evliyaoğlu O1, Acar M, Özcabı B, Erginöz E, Bucak F, Ercan O, Kucur M.</p><p>Author information</p><p>1İstanbul University Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, İstanbul, Turkey Phone: +90 533 633 15 64 E-mail: <a href=mailto:olcayevliyaoglu@hotmail.com>olcayevliyaoglu@hotmail.com</a>.</p><p>OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D has been suggested to be active as an immunomodulator in autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis (HT).

Serum 25OHD levels were measured in all subjects.</p><p>Results</p><p>The case:control ratio of geometric means of 25OHD levels was 0.66 (95 % CI: 0.49–0.90; P = 0.008). There was a significant inverse association between serum 25OHD levels and HT (OR: 0.81 for 5 ng/ml increase in 25OHD level, 95 % CI: 0.68–0.96; P = 0.018). This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors including age, sex and BMI.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Our study suggested that higher serum 25OHD levels was associated with decreased risk of HT so that <strong>each 5 ng/ml increase in the serum 25OHD levels results in 19 % decrease in odds of HT.</strong></p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li><p>Muszkat P, Camargo MB, Griz LH, Lazaretti-Castro M (2010) Evidence-based non-skeletal actions of vitamin D.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between vitamin D insufficiency and AITD, HT, and GD.</p><p>DESIGN:</p><p>Our cross-sectional study included patients who visited a tertiary hospital for thyroid evaluation or follow-up. A total of 776 patients in whom serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, thyroid function, and anti-thyroid antibodies had been measured were analyzed retrospectively. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D level &lt;75 nmol/L.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was significantly higher in the 369 patients with AITD than in the 407 without AITD (46.1% vs. 37.1%, p=0.011), and higher in the 221 patients with HT than in those with GD or non-AITD (48.9% vs. 41.9%, 37.1%, p=0.017). Among HT cases, patients with overt hypothyroidism had a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (60.4% vs. 44.1%, 21.7%, 37.1%, respectively, p &lt;0.001) and lower 25(OH)D levels (80.1 ± 47.7 vs. 99.34 ± 61.2, 110.3 ± 69.9, 99.6 ± 53.7 nmol/L, respectively, p=0.009) compared with those with euthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism or those without AITD. Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly negatively correlated with serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and sampling season (r= -0.127, p=0.013).</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Vitamin D insufficiency was associated with AITD and HT, especially overt hypothyroidism.

This study intends to determine the correlation between improvement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and AIT in patients from an outpatient endocrine clinic in Frankfurt, Germany. This study included 933 patients with thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO-Ab) ≥34 kIU/l, including most patients with clear AIT due to a concurrent sonographic evidence of reduced echogenicity. We performed clinical evaluation and laboratory analysis at five points in time within two years retrospectively. Due to a high dropout rate within the observation period, we excluded the last two time points from analysis. Data from 933 AIT patients revealed 89% having vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency <a href=25(OH)D%20%3C75%E2%80%89nmol/l>25(OH)D &lt;75 nmol/l</a> with a median 25(OH)D level of 39.7 nmol/l. At baseline, a weak inverse correlation between 25(OH)D and anti-TPO-Ab was observed during winter (rs=-0.09, p=0.048*), but not during summer time (p>0.2).</p><p>We discovered 58 patients having initially a 25(OH)D level &lt; 75 nmol/l (median: 40.2 nmol/l), which improved over time to a 25(OH)D level ≥ 75 nmol/l (median: 83.2 nmol/l, p&lt;0.0005***).</p><p>Simultaneously, the median anti-TPO-Ab level showed a significant decrease of 25% from 245.8 to 181.3 kIU/l (p=0.036*). A significant reduction of the median anti-TPO-Ab level of 9% was also observed in the control group, which consisted of patients having constantly a 25(OH)D level &lt;75 nmol/l.</p><p>The result may suggest that in particular patients with 25(OH)D levels &lt; 75 nmol/l benefit from an increase of 25(OH)D levels ≥ 75 nmol/l. Further prospective randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to finally evaluate if vitamin D has immunmodulatory effects in AIT.</p><hr><h4 id=hashimotos-thyroiditis-has-some-assocation-with-poor-vitamin-d-receptor---may-2021>Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis has some assocation with poor Vitamin D Receptor - May 2021</h4><p><strong>Assocoiation amount is behind a paywall as of May 2021</strong></p><p>Vitamin D status in Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis and its association with vitamin D receptor genetic variants</p><p>J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2021 May 17;105922. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2021.105922>doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2021.105922</a></p><p>Hany William Z Hanna 1, Cristiano Rizzo 2, Radwa Marawan Abdel Halim 3, Hemmat Elewa El Haddad 4, Randa Salam 5, Hazem El-Sayed Abou-Youssef 6</p><p>Background: Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis (HT) is considered the predominant cause of hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient countries. The deficiency of 25-OH-vitamin D3 serum level and the variation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene were implicated in a number of autoimmune disorders. This study aimed to test the hypothesis linking between VDR FokI and BsmI variants and HT, in addition to explain their impact on 25-OH-vitamin D3 serum level.</p><p>Materials and methods: Cross sectional study included 160 hypothyroid subjects, 112 patients with HT and 48 hypothyroid non-HT controls. They were diagnosed based on anti-TPO Ab and or anti-TG Ab results. All cases were subjected to full history taking, thyroid ultrasound examination and a panel of assays (TSH, f.T3, f.T4, anti-TPO Ab, anti-TG Ab, calcium, alkaline phosphatase and phosphate). Serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 was assayed using HPLC-UV method. VDR variants (FokI and BsmI) were genotyped using real-time PCR.</p><p>Results: FokI AA genotype was statistically higher in HT patients than control group (P value = 0.02) with subsequently higher serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 level in comparison to all other genotypes (P value = 0.039). Serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 level was statistically indifferent between HT and control group (P value = 0.223). A statistically significant increase in total thyroid volume was observed in HT group (P value = 0.002).</p><p>Conclusion: FokI AA genotype is more associated with HT in Egyptian patients compared to hypothyroid non-HT controls. Moreover, patients with FokI AA genotype have statistically higher levels of 25-OH-vitamin D3 suggesting VDR dysfunction even in patients expressing normal level of vitamin D.</p><hr><h4 id=ht-importance-of-vitamin-d-iodine-selenium-and-gluten---april-2017>HT: Importance of Vitamin D, Iodine, Selenium, and Gluten - April 2017</h4><p><strong>A concise review of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and the importance of iodine, selenium, vitamin D and gluten on the autoimmunity and dietary management of HT patients.Points that need more investigation</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/hashimoto-thyroiditis-i-se-vit-d.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=Hashimoto%27s++gluten&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48">19,000 hits for Hashimoto&rsquo;s and gluten in Google Scholar</a> as of Aug 2024</strong></p><p>It appears that people with Hashimoto&rsquo;s are 3X more likely to be gluten intolerant</p><hr><h4 id=ht-treated-by-selenium-better-than-by-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-dec-2024>HT treated by Selenium better than by Vitamin D - meta-analysis Dec 2024</h4><p><strong>Effects of different supplements on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mt-meta-selenium-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-also-web>See also web</h4><ul><li><a href=http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/black-seed-may-treat-hypothyroidism-hashimotos-disease-clinical-trial-reveals>Black Seed May Treat Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto&rsquo;s Disease), Clinical Trial Reveals</a> GreenMedInfo Updated Sept 2019</li></ul><blockquote><p>1 gram a day for 8 weeks had a significant difference</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/iodine-fuel-fire-hashimoto-s>Iodine: Fuel to the Fire in Hashimoto’s</a> GreenMed Info July 2017</li></ul><blockquote><p>a person disagrees with consensus, believing that Iodine should be REDUCED for Hashimoto’s</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Vitamin D is NOT mentioned</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://selfhacked.com/blog/hashimotos/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Hashimoto+s+thyroiditis%2C+Benfotiamine%2C+Selank%2C+Graves++disease%2C+Caffeine%2C+RAD140%2C+and+LPS&amp;utm_campaign=Dec0317newsletter">Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment</a> SelfHacked Nov 2017</li></ul><blockquote><p>Long article: Treatments include Vtiamin D, Iron, Selenium</p></blockquote></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>autoimmune</span>
