## Have you been getting enough D?

### Among other things, Vitamin D impacts your sex hormones and your mood, which, if you’re like most people, you definitely want working as well as possible!

So don’t feel like you have to be an equatorial nudist to get adequate vitamin D, 

but do make sure you take a vitamin D supplement ( **1,000 IU daily for every 25 pounds of total body weight).** 

And even though “adequate” vitamin D levels are around 30 ng/mL, aim for around 50-60, because that’s where you get your best benefits.
