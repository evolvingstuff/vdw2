For over a decade many researchers, like in this study, have been trying to treat Diabetes and other health problems using the Endocrine Society recommendation of 50,000 IU of vitamin D weekly for 3 months. At the end of three months, the vitamin D levels in this study had not yet gotten to even  a minimally healthy level.  

Success has been  found when one or more of the following were done

1. Increase the dose for those who are overweight

   * People weighing 300 lbs may need 4X more vitamin D than those weighing 150 lbs

1. Use a gut-friendly form of vitamin D

   * also - topical forms do not need the gut

1. Start by first restoring vitamin D levels

   * with larger doses for those who have low levels of vitamin D

1. Include co-factors needed by individuals– such as Magnesium

1. Include Vitamin D Receptor activators - to get the Vitamin D to the cells, not just the blood

Vitamin D deficiency could play an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as it may alter several crucial processes in the development of diabetes and its complications, such as pancreatic insulin secretion, peripheral insulin resistance, persistence of systemic „sterile” inflammation and immune activation. Vitamin D may also have an antioxidant effect through the inhibition of free radicals generation. The reported study was designed with eligible consecutively recruited patients with T2DM on standard metformin therapy (n=130), randomized in 1:1 ratio, considered to have undergone Vitamin D supplementation according to the guidelines proposed by the Endocrine Society, or to have continued with metformin only. The potential benefit was monitored through the influence on glycemia level, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance index (calculated as homeostatic model assessment; HOMA-IR), Castelli Risk Index I and Tryglicerides/Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TG/TBARS) Index in a 6-month follow up period. Our study indicates that oral daily doses of vitamin D improve HbA1c levels over the 3-month and 6-month period, followed by a significant decrease in advanced oxidation protein products levels over the 3-month period when higher vitamin D doses are given. The effect of vitamin D on HOMA-IR index, malondialdehyde levels and TG/TBARS index was not statistically significant. Further investigation should consider defining the doses of vitamin D in patients with T2DM which may attenuate the oxidative stress risk, the risk of metabolic syndrome and the risk of related cardiovascular events.
