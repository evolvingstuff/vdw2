Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a widespread global health issue, affecting nearly a billion individuals worldwide, and mounting evidence links it to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. The discovery of vitamin D receptors and metabolizing enzymes in cardiac and vascular cells, coupled with experimental studies, underscores the complex relationship between vitamin D and cardiovascular health. This review aims to synthesize and critically evaluate the preclinical evidence elucidating the role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health. We examined diverse preclinical in vitro (cardiomyocyte cell line) models and in vivo models, including knockout mice, diet-induced deficiency, and disease-specific animal models (hypertension, hypertrophy and myocardial infarction).

In vitro studies elucidate vitamin D&#39;s capacity to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation and inhibit pathological remodeling. In vivo studies further uncovered detrimental cardiac effects of VDD, while supplementation with vitamin D in cardiovascular disease (CVD) models demonstrated its protective effects by decreasing inflammation, attenuating hypertrophy, reduction in plaque formation, and improving cardiac function. Hence, this comprehensive review emphasizes the critical role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health and its potential as a preventive/therapeutic strategy in CVDs.
