**Quickly read the [Vitamin D entry in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) in Dec 2012** 

There are many errors, of both commission and omission.

Doubt that VitaminDWiki will have time to fight to correct these errors, since each error correction would probably take > 1 hour

1. Cats and dogs cannot synthesize vitamin D

> yet even later in the entry it says that all mammals synthesize vitamin D

> <a href="/posts/here-is-the-overview-of-vitamin-d-and-vets" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 17">Here is the Overview of Vitamin D and Vets</a>

1. Reference intakes for vitamin D assumes that no synthesis occurs

> yet it has been well documented that submariners, astronauts, and Antarctic residents need lots of vitamin D or UVB

1. Effects of vitamin D on health is uncertain

> <a href="/posts/random-controlled-trials-have-proven" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1336">Random Controlled trials have proven</a> that Vitamin D deals with 23+ health problems 

1. IoM report is solidly based on data

> There has been an <a href="/posts/avalanche-of-10000-studies-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2421">avalanche of >10,000 studies of vitamin D</a> since that study ceased looking at new information (2008)

1. Mentions that excess vitamin D causes premature aging

> This is based on the study which gave vitamin D far too infrequently – annually

> Try to imagine taking the entire year of any substance in a single day: such as 500 liters of water, 300 grams of vitamin C, etc.  Annual doses cause problems

1. Evidence that vitamin D supplementation for cardiovascular health is poor

> <a href="/posts/overview-of-cardiovascular-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 17">Overview of Cardiovascular and Vitamin D</a> points out that most studies did not use enough vitamin D – it includes

> 187 existing cardiovascular studies, 230 cardiovascular intervention trials with vitamin D, etc.

1. Currently evidence is insufficient to support supplementation in those with cancer

> <a href="/posts/overview-cancer-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 931">Overview Cancer and Vitamin D</a> 

1. Rickets is a rare disease

> Rickets ceased to be rare in the UK around 2010 with dropping vitamin D levels  and more dark skinned citizens 

1. No persuasive evidence of vitamin D levels in chronic pain sufferers

> <a href="/posts/overview-of-chronic-pain-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2462">Overview of Chronic Pain and Vitamin D</a> 

> includes not only evidence of low vitamin D and chronic pain, but also that vitamin D intervention reduces a great many chronic pains

1. Sites an old study in China that vitamin D did not vary with latitude

> New studies have found that <a href="/posts/uv-cancers-etc" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 404">UV, Cancers, etc</a>. do indeed vary with latitude in China

1. Do not to take vitamin D with primary hyperparathyroidims - references a 1997 paper

> There has been a complete reversal since 1997. Now you should take vitamin D. The 1997 author's update in 2012 does not even mention  hyperparathyroidim

1. No longer get vitamin D from the sun after about 20 minutes exposure

> Need >20 minutes if not near the equator

> Need >20 minutes if not whole body exposure

> Seniors need >20 minutes as their skin is not as efficient at producing vitamin D

> The reference is not up-to-date - 1995.  A lot has been learned since then.

1. Sunscreen SPF = 8 reduces vitamin D synthesis capacity by 95%

> In reality SPF documents blocking of UVA (tanning) but not UVB (vitamin D)

> There is a huge difference between blocking of UVB by SPF 8 sunscreens

1. about a third of Australians have vitamin D deficiency

> 1) That study is based on 10 year old data and levels have declined since then

> 2) That study assumed <20 ng was deficiency.  As of 2010 it is guessed that 80% have less than 30 ng of vitamin D

> 3) Ignores dark skinned Australians [Black Sudanese children 350X more likely to have rickets than other Australians](/posts/black-sudanese-children-350x-more-likely-to-have-rickets-than-other-australians)

1. Information on the long-term effects is incomplete

> Some groups around the world have been taking large doses of vitamin D for over 50 years without problems

> – but those people are different – they did not live in the US, so it must be tested in the US before being believed

There are perhaps 30 more important omitions.  Such as:

additional diseases prevented, additional diseases treated, safety of dose vs time, diseases which use-up vitamin D, 

loading dose, how often to take, cofactors, rare allergic reaction (about 1 in 300), vitamin D does not accumulate in the body
