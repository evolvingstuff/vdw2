### for Vitamin D Council as of Aug 2011

PubMed =  Aug 8, 2011 PubMed.gov , words in title and/or abstract;

&nbsp; &nbsp;for cancer, the first number is a search using “vitamin D” and “breast cancer” 

&nbsp; &nbsp;while the second number is a search using “vitamin D”, “breast” and “cancer”

&nbsp; &nbsp;PM2 = Feb, 2011, not updated in Aug, 2011

E = Ecol = ecological studies

O = Obser = observational studies, 

R = RCT = randomized controlled trial (or used in treatment with positive results)

S =  Strong Evidence =  *****  = some combination of ecological, observational, cross-sectional studies, 

&nbsp; &nbsp;and/or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and possibly an understanding of the mechanisms. 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Since solar UVB is the primary source of vitamin D, he does not consider it necessary to have a supporting RCT.

M = Mod = moderate strength evidence

A =Assoc. = associated effects of low vitamin D due to comorbid diseases or treatment.
