 **Osteoporosis is frequent among alcoholics**  all by a direct effect of ethanol, malnutrition, and  **liver** failure. 

Therefore, it may be related to survival. 

The aim of this study was to assess bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content, hormonal status, and to determine prognostic value of these parameters in a total of 124 alcoholics followed up for a median period of 57 months. Several bone homeostasis-related hormones were measured in patients and age- and sex-matched controls. Whole-body densitometry was performed by a Hologic QDR-2000 (Waltham, MA) densitometer; nutritional status and liver function were assessed. 

Sixty patients underwent a second evaluation 6 months later. Patients showed lower serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (median=58, interquartile range <span>[IQR]</span>=33-135 vs. 135ng/mL, IQR=116-243ng/mL, P<.001), vitamin D (25.5, IQR=18.3-36.8 vs. 79.9pg/mL, IQR=59.2-107.8pg/mL, P<.001), and osteocalcin (2.1, IQR=1.1-4.5 vs. 6.5ng/mL, IQR=4.7-8.7ng/mL, P<.001) than controls, and lower BMD values, and lower Z- and T-scores at right and left legs and arms, thoracic and lumbar spine, pelvis, and right and left ribs. By multiple regression analysis, BMD mainly depends on nutritional parameters and liver function. Kaplan-Meier curves show that subtotal BMD and BMD at both arms and pelvis were significantly related with survival. Patients who had lost total hip BMD after 6 months showed a shorter survival than those who had not, but using Cox's regression, encephalopathy, ascites, and nutritional parameters displaced BMD as prognostic factor. Therefore, osteopenia ensues in chronic alcoholic patients. It mainly depends on poor nutrition and is related to survival, although surpassed in this sense by encephalopathy, ascites, and nutritional parameters. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
