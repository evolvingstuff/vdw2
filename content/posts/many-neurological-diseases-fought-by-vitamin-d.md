Vitamin D may have multiple effects on the nervous system and its deficiency can represent a possible risk factor for the development of many neurological diseases. Recent studies are also trying to clarify the different effects of vitamin D supplementation over the course of progressive neurological diseases. 

In this narrative review, we summarise vitamin D chemistry, metabolism, mechanisms of action, and the recommended daily intake. 

The role of vitamin D on gene transcription and the immune response is also reviewed. Finally, we discuss the scientific evidence that links low 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations to the onset and progression of severe neurological diseases, such as 

* multiple sclerosis, 

* Parkinson’s disease,

* Alzheimer’s disease, 

* migraine, 

* diabetic neuropathy and 

* amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 

 **Completed and ongoing clinical trials on vitamin D supplementation in neurological diseases are listed.**
