Context: Observational studies show an association between low vitamin D status assessed by circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and cardiovascular events and mortality. Data from randomized controlled trials are limited.

Objective: The aim of this study was to test whether daily doses of vitamin D3 at 400 or 1000 IU/d for 1 yr affected conventional markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Design: We conducted a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial. 

Randomization was computer generated. 

Participants and study investigators were blinded to intervention groupings throughout the trial.

Setting: The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Facility, University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom.

Participants: A total of 305 healthy postmenopausal women aged 60–70 yr were recruited for the study.

Intervention: Each woman received a daily capsule of 400 or 1000 IU vitamin D3 or placebo randomly allocated.

Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were 

* serum lipid profile <span>[total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; triglycerides; and apolipoproteins A-1 and B100]</span>, 

* insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment), 

* inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1), and 

* blood pressure.

Results: A total of 265 (87%) participants completed all study visits. 

Small differences between groups for serum apolipoprotein B100 change [repeated measures ANOVA, P = 0.04; mean (SD), ?1.0 (10.0) mg/dl (400 IU); ?1.0 (10.0) mg/dl (1000 IU); and +0.02 (10.0) mg/dl (placebo)](repeated%20measures%20ANOVA,%20P%20=%200.04;%20mean%20(SD),%20?1.0%20(10.0)%20mg/dl%20(400%20IU);%20?1.0%20(10.0)%20mg/dl%20(1000%20IU);%20and%20+0.02%20(10.0)%20mg/dl%20(placebo)) were not considered clinically significant. Other systemic markers for CVD risk remained unchanged. There was significant seasonal variation in systolic and diastolic blood pressure independent of vitamin D dose (P < 0.001, linear mixed model). Mean (SD) reduction in systolic blood pressure from winter to summer was ?6.6 (10.8) mm Hg.

Conclusions: Improving vitamin D status through dietary supplementation is unlikely to reduce CVD risk factors. 

Confounding of seasonality should be recognized and addressed in future studies of vitamin D.
