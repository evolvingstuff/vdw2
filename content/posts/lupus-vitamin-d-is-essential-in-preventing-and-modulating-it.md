Systemic lupus erythematosus (abbreviated SLE or lupus) is a systemic autoimmune disease, with genetic, immunologic, hormonal, and environmental factors.1 One of the environmental factors that has been studied over the years is vitamin D, which is created in the human body in response to exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

This review aims at examining findings from recent years, specifically 2013–2014, regarding the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and SLE flares, severity, and clinical manifestation, as well as to examine the treatment options derived from this relationship.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease. Current treatment strategies rely heavily on corticosteroids, which are in turn responsible for a significant burden of morbidity, and immunosuppressives which are limited by suboptimal efficacy, increased infections and malignancies. There are significant deficiencies in our immunosuppressive armamentarium, making immunomodulatory therapies crucial, offering the opportunity to prevent disease flare and the subsequent accrual of damage. Currently available immunomodulators include prasterone (synthetic dehydroeipandrosterone), vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab. These therapies, acting via numerous cellular and cytokine pathways, have been shown to modify the aberrant immune responses associated with SLE without overt immunosuppression. 

*  **Vitamin D**  is important in SLE and supplementation appears to have a positive impact on disease activity particularly proteinuria 

*  **Belimumab**  has specific immunomodulatory properties and is an effective therapy in those with specific serological and clinical characteristics predictive of response. 

*  **Hydroxychloroquine**  is a crucial background medication in SLE with actions in many molecular pathways. 

> It has disease specific effects in reducing flare, treating cutaneous disease and inflammatory arthralgias in addition to other effects such as reduced thrombosis, increased longevity, improved lipids, better glycemic control and blood pressure. 

*  **Dehydroeipandrosterone**  is also an immunomodulator in SLE which can have positive effects on disease activity and has bone protective properties. 

This review outlines the immunologic actions of these drugs and the clinical evidence supporting their use.
