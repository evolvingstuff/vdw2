Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a wide-ranging spectrum of clinical symptoms, from asymptomatic/mild to severe. Recent research indicates that, among several factors, a low vitamin D level is a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19 patients. This study aims to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on hospital and laboratory outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) and clinicaltrials.gov were searched until July 2022, using relevant keywords/Mesh terms. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that addressed the topic were included. The Cochrane tool was used to assess the studies’ risk of bias, and the data were analyzed using the review manager (RevMan 5.4).

We included  **nine RCTs with 1586 confirmed COVID-19 patients.** Vitamin D group showed a significant reduction of intensive care unit (ICU) admission ( **risk ratio = 0.59** , 95% confidence interval (CI) <span>[0.41, 0.84]</span>, P = 0.003), and higher change in vitamin D level (standardized mean difference = 2.27, 95% CI <span>[2.08, 2.47]</span>, P < 0.00001) compared to the control group. Other studied hospital and laboratory outcomes showed non-significant difference between vitamin D and the control group (P > 0.05).

In conclusion, vitamin D reduced the risk of ICU admission and showed superiority in changing vitamin D level compared to the control group. However, other outcomes showed no difference between the two groups. More RCTs are needed to confirm these results.
