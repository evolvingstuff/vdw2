#### [12 minute video, Nov 2016 @ American Public Health Association](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48dNVHg9FcU)

##### Mistake #1: % of cadavers with poor bones with 20-30 ng of vitamin D

They computed the ratio of bad bones with 20-30 ng vs all cadavers, rather than just those with 20-30 ng

If they had used the correct denominator the result would have been 28-30 ng, not 20 ng

##### Mistake #2: Not having enough data to conclude that >4,000 IU is too much (i.e. harm)

 **Chart did not have any error bars**

 **This next chart shows the tiny differences**

##### Mistake #3: Institute of Medicine used data only for bone health, but the rest of the body needs higher levels

##### Mistake #4): Incorrectly estimated dose needed to get 97.5 % of population to a vitamin D level

#### Sharing Scientific Data and Replicability, Keith Baggerly 45 minute video, March 2017

|[Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia, Published on Mar 22, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y33I8Zb55Rw)

This talk was given by Keith Baggerly, MD Anderson Cancer Center as part of the National Academy of Sciences Arthur M. Sackler Colloquium on Reproducibility of Research: Issues and Proposed Remedies held in Washington, D.C. on March 8-10, 2017

Note: A Parathyroid Hormone analysis of 2016-2017 independently found that a vitamin D level of **31 ng** is needed

Note: 97.5% of the population = 2 sigma of an ideal bell curve distribution (the actual distribution is a very distorted bell curve)

#### 3,000 IU is needed to get 97.5% of the population to 30ng

 **Note: 3,000 IU daily ==> 42,000 IU every two weeks. which is very close to the [50,000 IU proposed by VitaminDWiki 3 years before](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">3,000 IU is 5X more than the 600 IU erroneous conclusion of the Institute of Medicine in 2010</span>**

#### Pregnant women in East Africa have vitamin D levels of about 60 ng

 **Yellow = pregnant women**

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Baggerly's are hoping to get signicant progress on correcting the error by the end of Sept 2017</span>**

> 8%, not 1% of the people having >20 ng/ml had bone loss, so the 20 ng/ml voted level was incorrect

* Note: Even if you have a good blood level of vitamin D,  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poor genes, low Magnesium, low Omega-3, etc restrict how much vitamin D actually gets to your cells
