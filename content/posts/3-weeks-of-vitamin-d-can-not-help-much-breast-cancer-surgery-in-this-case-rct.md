PURPOSE:

Epidemiologic and preclinical data suggest a potential role for vitamin D in breast cancer treatment and prevention. However, results of prospective randomized trials are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on breast tumour proliferation and apoptosis.

METHODS:

We conducted a prospective, randomized, phase 2, double-blinded pre-surgical window of opportunity trial. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were randomized to receive  **40,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day**  or placebo for 2 to 6 weeks prior to breast surgery. The primary outcome was the relative change in proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 apoptotic assay <span>[CC3]</span>) in primary breast cancer cells pre and post treatment.

RESULTS:

Of 83 patients randomized, 80 completed the study (43 (53.8%) vitamin D and 37 (46.3%) placebo). Mean duration of drug intake was  **19 days** (range 9-28 days). There were no significant differences between the control arm and the vitamin D arm in percent changes of either Ki67 index (1.6% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.25) or CC3 (- 55.9% vs. - 45.9%, p = 0.28). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels were 3 times higher in the vitamin D arm (62 nmol/L vs. 246 nmol/L, p < 0.001). Adverse effects were minimal and all classified as grade 1.

CONCLUSIONS:

Despite significantly higher levels of serum 25-OHD in the vitamin D-treated group, this was not associated with any significant effects on tumour proliferation or apoptosis. These findings are consistent with the lack of benefit observed in prospective prevention trials.
