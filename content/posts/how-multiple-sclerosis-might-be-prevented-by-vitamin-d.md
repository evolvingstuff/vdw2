#### The Role of Vitamin D in Neuroprotection in Multiple Sclerosis: An Update

Nutrients. 2023 Jun 30;15(13):2978. [doi: 10.3390/nu15132978.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15132978.)

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological condition that involves both inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative components. MS research and treatments have traditionally focused on immunomodulation, with less investigation of neuroprotection, and this holds true for the role of vitamin D in MS. Researchers have already established that vitamin D plays an anti-inflammatory role in modulating the immune system in MS. More recently, researchers have begun investigating the potential neuroprotective role of vitamin D in MS. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, has a range of neuroprotective properties, which may be important in remyelination and/or the prevention of demyelination. The most notable finding relevant to MS is that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes stem cell proliferation and drives the differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes, which carry out remyelination. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 counteracts neurodegeneration and oxidative stress by suppressing the activation of reactive astrocytes and M1 microglia. 1,25(OH)2D3 also promotes the expression of various neuroprotective factors, including neurotrophins and antioxidant enzymes. 1,25(OH)2D3 decreases blood-brain barrier permeability, reducing leukocyte recruitment into the central nervous system. These neuroprotective effects, stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3, all enhance neuronal survival. This review summarizes and connects the current evidence supporting the vitamin D-mediated mechanisms of action for neuroprotection in MS.
