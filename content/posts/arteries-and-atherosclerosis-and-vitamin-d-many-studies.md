#### Perplexity & Deep Reasoning on Vitamin D and Atherosclerosis - [Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-relationship-betwe-n9SjRJFCTAOa1PZBYPMujw)

 **Starts with**  

Atherosclerosis, characterized by chronic arterial plaque formation, remains a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Emerging evidence positions vitamin D as a critical modulator of atherosclerotic pathways, influencing endothelial function, immune regulation, and vascular homeostasis. This review synthesizes mechanistic insights and clinical evidence to elucidate how vitamin D deficiency exacerbates atherosclerosis while exploring the therapeutic potential of supplementation.

 **Therapeutic Implications and Future Directions** 

Supplementation Strategies

Current evidence supports targeting 25(OH)D levels of 30–50 ng/mL for cardiovascular protection. Doses of 2,000–4,000 IU/day are generally safe, though obese individuals and those with malabsorption may require higher intake. Combining vitamin D with calcium warrants caution, as co-supplementation may blunt blood pressure benefits despite enhancing PTH suppression.

Personalized Approaches

Genomic studies identify VDR polymorphisms (e.g., BsmI, FokI) that influence vitamin D responsiveness. Carriers of the FokI ff genotype exhibit stronger anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting pharmacogenomic tailoring could optimize outcomes1213. Subgroup analyses also indicate heightened benefits in deficient populations with elevated hs-CRP or hypertension

Novel Pathways and Senescence

Emerging research links vitamin D to cellular senescence—a driver of vascular aging. Vitamin D mitigates senescent cell accumulation in plaques by upregulating klotho and suppressing p16INK4a, potentially delaying atherosclerosis progression. Local intracrine signaling within adipose tissue and macrophages may also modulate plaque stability independently of systemic levels, opening avenues for tissue-targeted therapies

   * "Patients with serum vitamin D (OH) levels >60 ng/mL had higher plaque density (p = 0.04), indicating more calc ified and less vulnerable plaque. Conclusions: In this retrospective case–control cohort study, vitamin D supplementation was associated with less high-risk plaque, less non-calcified plaque burden, and a higher calcified plaque independent of CV risk factors."
