In a cross-sectional study including 324 patients older than 65 years admitted to our hospital for osteoporotic hip fracture, we found that those patients with a more severe vitamin D deficiency had more severe osteoporotic hip fractures (Garden grades III-IV and Kyle III-IV).

INTRODUCTION: To identify possible differences in baseline characteristics of patients with different types of osteoporotic hip fracture.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study including consecutive individuals over 65 admitted to our hospital for osteoporotic hip fracture over a year. Demographic data, fracture type, comorbidities, history of osteoporosis, functional capacity, nutritional status and vitamin D storage were evaluated.

RESULTS: We included 324 patients (83?±?7 years, 80% women). Two hundred sixteen patients (67%) had vitamin D deficiency (25OHD3 <25 ng/ml). In patients with severe femoral neck or intertrochanteric fractures (Garden III-IV and Kyle III-IV), vitamin D deficiency was more frequent (74%) and severe (25OHD3 20?±?15 ng/ml) than in patients with less severe fractures (57%, 25OHD3 26?±?21 ng/ml). Forty-three percent of patients had previous fractures. Only 15% of patients had been previously diagnosed with osteoporosis and 10% were receiving treatment. Patients receiving vitamin D supplements have higher 20OHD3 levels and less severe fractures.

CONCLUSIONS: Although vitamin D levels are not different between patients with intracapsular or extracapsular hip fractures, a more severe vitamin D deficiency seems to be associated to more severe osteoporotic hip fractures. A prior vitamin D supplementation could avoid a higher severity of these fractures.
