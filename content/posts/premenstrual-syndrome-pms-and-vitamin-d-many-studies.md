Background: Less is understood about female's nutrient intake's impact on the severity of the menstrual cycle (MC) symptoms, which consequently interferes with their life quality.

Objectives: The goal of this study is to look at the relationship between female nutrient consumption and the severity of MC symptoms to better understand how food affects women's quality of life during their MCs.

Design: To investigate this impact among healthy adult women, a self-administered, cross-sectional online questionnaire was obtained from 204 regularly menstruating women aged between 18 and 40.

Methods: The questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, a semi-food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), Arabic Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (A-PMS-S) for MC symptoms.

Results: Results showed intake of  **polyunsaturated fatty acids**  (PUFAs) was associated with lower no to mild versus moderate to severe

* physical symptoms (odds ratio (OR): 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59-0.85; p < 0.001),

* psychological symptoms (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; p < 0.05), and

* functioning symptoms (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83-1.02; p > 0.1).

 **Thiamine**  prevented

* psychological symptoms (OR: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.02-0.02; p < 0.001),

* physiological symptoms (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.58-0.60; p < 0.001), and

* functioning symptoms (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.47-0.48; p < 0.001).

Saturated fat, iron, and niacin intakes  **increased the risk**  of experiencing MC psychological symptoms.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MC symptoms were correlated with some nutrient intake from food sources, which is considered an external controllable factor more than demographic characteristics. Therefore, women should be aware of the type of food consumed during their monthly MC phase.

##### 70% of trials used 100,000+ IU per month

Vitamin D reduces prostaglandin levels and inflammation, making it a promising treatment option for dysmenorrhoea. However, its effects on pain intensity in different types of dysmenorrhoea remain unclear. We examined whether vitamin D supplementation decreases pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhoea. The Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 30 December 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation effects on such patients were included. The primary and secondary outcomes were measured by the changes in pain intensity and rescue analgesic use, respectively. Pooled mean differences and rate ratios were calculated using a random-effect model;  **trial sequential analysis (TSA)**  was also performed. Overall, 11 studies involving 687 participants were included. Vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhoea compared with controls (pooled mean difference, −1.64; 95% confidence interval, −2.27 to −1.00; p < 0.001; CoE, moderate; I2 statistic, 79.43%) and indicated substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. TSA revealed that the current RCTs provide sufficient information. In subgroup analyses, vitamin D supplement reduced primary dysmenorrhoea pain but not secondary dysmenorrhoea pain.

In conclusion, although substantial heterogeneity persists, vitamin D supplementation decreased pain intensity in patients with dysmenorrhea, especially in those with primary dysmenorrhoea.

Background

Primary dysmenorrhea is considered as one of the women’s main problems during reproductive age. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D on the severity of dysmenorrhea and menstrual blood loss.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, was performed on 84 single female college students between 18 and 25 years old who living in dormitories. Students with primary dysmenorrhea and vitamin D deficiency were divided into experimental (n = 42) and control (n = 42) groups. Five days before the putative beginning of their next menstrual cycle, the experimental group received 300,000 IU vitamin D (50,000 IU, two tablets every 8 h), and the control group received a placebo (oral paraffin). The effects of the supplement on the severity of dysmenorrhea and menstrual blood loss were evaluated one cycle before and during two successive cycles. Using the visual analog scale (VAS), verbal multidimensional scoring system (VMS), and pictorial blood assessment chart (PBLAC) questionnaires. Fisher’s exact, Chi-square, independent sample t-test and repeated measurements were used.

Results

In total, 78 of the 84 students completed the study (39 students per group). The intervention resulted in a significant reduction in the mean scores of both the VAS and VMS in the experimental group, in the first and second menstrual cycles (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), but not in the means score of PBLAC. Mefenamic acid consumption at the first and second menstruation period, in the experimental group was lower than the control group (p = 0.009, p < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

The results indicate that vitamin D supplementation could decrease the severity of primary dysmenorrhea and the need to consume pain-relief medications. Contrariwise vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on menstrual blood loss.
