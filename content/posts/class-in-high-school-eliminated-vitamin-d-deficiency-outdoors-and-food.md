Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is highly prevalent even in young people. Vitamin D status has been linked to the BMI and insulin resistance.

Aim: Determine 25(OH)D concentrations in adolescents before and after nutritional intervention program (NIP) and its relationship to BMI and metabolic syndrome (MS).

Methods: We selected 256 secondary school students (127 males) aged between 12 and 16 years from Granada (Spain), who were followed-up throughout one school year. In September and May it was determined 25(OH)D, food consumption frequency and both anthropometric and biochemical profile. The NIP comprised a  **class**  on nutritional and lifestyle recommendations for adolescents to achieve adequate growth,  **limiting TV/computer use substituted by outdoor activity and physically active, every 15 days** and daily breakfast in school composed of a diary product rich in vitamin D, fruit, cereals, nuts, and sandwich with protein content.

Results: Preintervention, 

* 18.7% of adolescents present vitamin D deficiency, 

* 7.4% present a several deficiency, and 

* 38.2% present insufficiency. 

After the NIP, the prevalence of 

* deficiency was reduced to 0.46% (P<0.0001) and 

* insufficiency was reduced to 19.1% (P<0.0001). 

The NIP effects depends on the BMI (P<0.006), fat mass (P<0.05), consumption of linolenic acid (P<0.03), and plama cholesterol (P<0.02).

Conclusion: The NIP has a powerful effect on vitamin D status, correcting the deficiency and reducing significantly the prevalence of insufficiency.
