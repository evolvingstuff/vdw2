 **CONCLUSIONS** 

Omega-3 PUFA and vitamin D are widely taken by healthy people, patients with risk factors and patients with CVD. However, the available data do not support their efficacy among healthy subjects and patients with specific cardiac diseases. Thus, these supplements should not be used without evidence-based medicine.
