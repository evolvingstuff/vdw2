### There were many [deaths in Florida](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6026a1.htm?s_cid=mm6026a1_e&source=govdelivery) due prescription overdose and a some due to illicit drug overdose

{IMG(attId="629")}{IMG}

Alternate Text: The figure above shows the annual drug overdose death rates for selected prescription and illicit drugs in Florida for 2003-2009. Among seven specific drugs examined, in 2003 the highest death rate was for cocaine (3.2 per 100,000 population), followed by methadone (2.2), oxycodone (1.7), heroin (1.4), morphine and alprazolam (1.3), and hydrocodone (1.1). In 2009, the number of deaths involving prescription drugs was four times the number involving illicit drugs, and the highest death rate was for oxycodone (6.4 per 100,00 population), followed by alprazolam (4.4), methadone (3.9), cocaine (2.8), morphine (1.6), hydrocodone (1.4), and heroin (0.5). 

"During 2003--2009, a total of 16,550 drug overdose deaths were recorded by Florida medical examiners. "

* which is an average of 2300 deaths per year in Florida (population 18 million)

* versus 0 deaths per year in the entire US for any kind of vitamin or herb (population 307 million)

### Even if there were 1 death due to vitamins per year, then

 **The US death rate for drug overdose could still be <span style="color:#F00;">40,000X  more than that of all vitamins and herbs </span>** 

(2300 X 307 million/18 million)

But, if we allow that the death rate due to drug overdose may be 2X higher in Florida than in the rest of the US (so many elderly)

the death rate due to overdose may be only 20,000 X more
