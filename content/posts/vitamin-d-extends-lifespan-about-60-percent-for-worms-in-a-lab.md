### [Nice description of study at Medical Express](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-10-vitamin-d-current-view-benefits.html)

 **The more the vitamin D which was added, the longer the worms lived**

 **Zero data that lifespan of other animals, including humans, would also be extended, but we can hope**

 **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans)** 

* “Caenorhabditis elegans is a free-living (not parasitic), transparent nematode (roundworm), about 1 mm in length, that lives in temperate soil environments.”

* “ **C. elegans was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequence** ”

* “In 2002, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Sydney Brenner, H. Robert Horvitz, and John Sulston for their work on the genetics of organ development and programmed cell death in C. elegans.”
