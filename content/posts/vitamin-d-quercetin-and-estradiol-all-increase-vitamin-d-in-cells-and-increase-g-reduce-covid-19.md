#### Abstract

Genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN, were employed as baits to build genomic-guided molecular maps of upstream regulatory elements, their expression and functions in the human body, and pathophysiologically -relevant cell types. Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents.

Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic.

Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. 

Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. 

Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents.

In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.

#### Conclusions

The main motivation of this work was to identify human genes implicated in regulatory cross

talks affecting expression and functions of the ACE2 and FURIN genes to build a model of genomic

regulatory interactions potentially affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection. A panel of genes acting as

activators and/or repressors of the ACE2 and/or FURIN expression then could be employed to search

for existing drugs and medicinal substances that, based on their mechanisms of action, could be

defined as candidate coronavirus infection mitigation agents. After experimental and clinical

validation, these existing drugs and/or medicinal agents could be utilized to ameliorate the clinical

severity of the pandemic. This knowledge could also be exploited in an ongoing effort to discover

novel targeted therapeutics tailored to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and block the entry of the virus

into human cells. Observations reported in this contribution are in agreement with recent studies

describing numerous beneficial clinical effects of the vitamin D supplementations, emphasizing

many detrimental effects of the vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, and underscoring the

significant COVID-19 mitigation potential of vitamin D <sup>[29,30]</sup>. Importantly, two recent

interventional randomized clinical trials aiming to evaluate effects of vitamin D on the prevention

and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website

[https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334005](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334005) (Spain)

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04344041](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04344041) (France)

One of the important findings documented herein is that identified medicinal compounds with

potential coronavirus infection-mitigating effects also appear to induce cell type-specific patterns of

gene expression alterations. Therefore, based on all observations reported in this study, it has been

concluded that any definitive recommendations regarding the potential clinical utility of the herein

identified putative coronavirus infection-mitigating agents, namely vitamin D, quercetin, and

estradiol, should be made only after preclinical studies and randomized controlled clinical trials have

been appropriately designed, carefully executed, and the desired outcomes have been reached.

A supercomputer modeling study using the world’s most powerful supercomputer, SUMMIT,

identified several candidate small molecule drugs which bind to either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 Viral

S-protein at its host receptor region or to the S protein-human ACE2 interface <sup>[42]</sup>. Interestingly, in

this study, quercetin was identified among the top five scoring ligands for viral S-protein-human

ACE2 receptor interface. Thus, quercetin also appears to be a potentially promising therapeutic

molecule that may directly interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. Previously

reported experiments demonstrated that quercetin appears to inhibit SARS-CoV entry into host cells

<sup>[43]</sup>. Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes, for the entry into human cells, the same receptor (ACE2) and the

accessory protease FURIN as the SARS-CoV coronavirus <sup>[3]</sup>, these observations suggest that

quercetin may, indeed, possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as well. Significantly, both

quercetin and luteolin have been identified among the top five ligands for the viral S-protein–human

ACE2 receptor interface–ligand-binding complex <sup>[42]</sup>, suggesting that these highly structurally

similar compounds (Figure 7) could serve as efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consistent

with this hypothesis, it has been reported that both quercetin and luteolin significantly inhibit the

SARS-CoV virus infection <sup>[43]</sup>
