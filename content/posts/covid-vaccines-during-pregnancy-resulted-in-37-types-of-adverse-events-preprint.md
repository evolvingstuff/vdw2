Introduction: In Part I of this three-part series we report a retrospective, population-based cohort study assessing rates of adverse events (AEs) in pregnancy after COVID-19 vaccines compared to the same AEs after influenza vaccines and after all other vaccines. Methods: Data were collected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System  **(VAERS) database was queried from January 1, 1990, to April 26, 2024** , for adverse events (AEs) involving pregnancy complications following COVID-19 vaccination. The time-period included 412 months for all vaccines except COVID-19 vaccines, having been used for only 40 of the 412 months (December 1, 2020, to April 26, 2024). Proportional reporting ratios (PRR) by time compared AEs after COVID-19 vaccination to those after influenza vaccination, and after all other vaccine products administered to pregnant women. In cases in which the PRR was not applicable, Chi-square analysis and Fisher’s exact tests were used according to CDC/FDA guidance. CDC/FDA stipulate a safety concern if a PRR is ≥ 2 or if a Chi-square is ≥ 4. 

Results: The CDC/FDA’s safety signals were breached for all 37 AEs following COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy: miscarriage

1. fetal chromosomal abnormality

1. fetal malformation

1. cervical insufficiency

1. premature rupture of membranes

1. premature labor

1. premature delivery

1. placental calcification

1. placental infarction

1. placental thrombosis

1. placenta accreta

1. placental abruption

1. placental insufficiency

1. placental disorder

1. fetal maternal hemorrhage

1. fetal growth restriction

1. reduced amniotic fluid volume

1. preeclampsia

1. fetal heart rate abnormality

1. fetal cardiac disorder

1. fetal vascular mal-perfusion

1. fetal arrhythmia

1. fetal distress

1. fetal biophysical profile abnormal

1. hemorrhage in pregnancy

1. fetal cardiac arrest

1. fetal death (stillbirth)

1. premature infant death

1. neonatal asphyxia

1. neonatal dyspnea

1. neonatal infection

1. neonatal hemorrhage

1. insufficient breast milk

1. neonatal pneumonia

1. neonatal respiratory distress

1. neonatal respiratory distress syndrome

1. and neonatal seizure. 

 **All p values were ≤ 0.001 with the majority being <0.000001.** 

Summary statistics for the deviation from the CDC/FDA safety signals mean (n range) are as follows: 

* PRR 69.3 (46  5.37 - 499); z statistic 9.64 (46  3.29 - 27.0); and 

* Chi-square was 74.7 (26 28.9 - 148).

#### Note: Billions of influenza vaccinations have been given during the 400 month coverage of VAERS

Conclusions: We found unacceptably high breaches in safety signals for 37 AEs after COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women. An immediate global moratorium on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is warranted. The United States government. medical organizations, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies have misled and/or deceived the public regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Promotion of these products must be immediately halted.

Introduction: In Part I of this three-part series we report a retrospective, population-based cohort study assessing rates of adverse events (AEs) in pregnancy after COVID-19 vaccines compared to the same AEs after influenza vaccines and after all other vaccines. Methods: Data were collected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The CDC/FDA Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System __(VAERS) database was queried from January 1, 1990, to April 26, 2024__, for adverse events (AEs) involving pregnancy complications following COVID-19 vaccination. The time-period included 412 months for all vaccines except COVID-19 vaccines, having been used for only 40 of the 412 months (December 1, 2020, to April 26, 2024). Proportional reporting ratios (PRR) by time compared AEs after COVID-19 vaccination to those after influenza vaccination, and after all other vaccine products administered to pregnant women. In cases in which the PRR was not applicable, Chi-square analysis and Fisher’s exact tests were used according to CDC/FDA guidance. CDC/FDA stipulate a safety concern if a PRR is ≥ 2 or if a Chi-square is ≥ 4. 

Results: The CDC/FDA’s safety signals were breached for all 37 AEs following COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy: miscarriage
# fetal chromosomal abnormality
# fetal malformation
# cervical insufficiency
# premature rupture of membranes
# premature labor
# premature delivery
# placental calcification
# placental infarction
# placental thrombosis
# placenta accreta
# placental abruption
# placental insufficiency
# placental disorder
# fetal maternal hemorrhage
# fetal growth restriction
# reduced amniotic fluid volume
# preeclampsia
# fetal heart rate abnormality
# fetal cardiac disorder
# fetal vascular mal-perfusion
# fetal arrhythmia
# fetal distress
# fetal biophysical profile abnormal
# hemorrhage in pregnancy
# fetal cardiac arrest
# fetal death (stillbirth)
# premature infant death
# neonatal asphyxia
# neonatal dyspnea
# neonatal infection
# neonatal hemorrhage
# insufficient breast milk
# neonatal pneumonia
# neonatal respiratory distress
# neonatal respiratory distress syndrome
# and neonatal seizure. 
__All p values were ≤ 0.001 with the majority being &lt;0.000001. __
Summary statistics for the deviation from the CDC/FDA safety signals mean (n range) are as follows: 
*PRR 69.3 (46  5.37 - 499); z statistic 9.64 (46  3.29 - 27.0); and 
*Chi-square was 74.7 (26 28.9 - 148).

Conclusions: We found unacceptably high breaches in safety signals for 37 AEs after COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women. An immediate global moratorium on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is warranted. The United States government. medical organizations, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies have misled and/or deceived the public regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Promotion of these products must be immediately halted.
