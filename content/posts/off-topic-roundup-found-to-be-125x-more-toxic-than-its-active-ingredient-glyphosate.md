### [Roundup Herbicide 125 Times More Toxic Than Regulators Say](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/roundup-herbicide-125-times-more-toxic-regulators-say?utm_source=www.GreenMedInfo.com&utm_campaign=ce6a06ecef-Greenmedinfo&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_193c8492fb-ce6a06ecef-86748089) GreenMedInfo, April 2014

Based on study  **Major pesticides are more toxic to human cells than their declared active principles** , published in the journal Biomedical Research International, which is attached at the bottom of this page.

Study looked at 9 major pesticides: 

* 3 herbicides, 

* 3 insecticides, and 

* 3 fungicides.

Found that in EVERY CASE, the ‘’inactive’’ ingredients made the pesticide far more toxic to humans than its ‘’active’’ ingredients 

## The graphs of human cell survival for Roundup and Glyphosate

These are placental cells exposed for <24 hours.  Researches noted that the toxicity is worse for longer time periods.

## Key findings included:

* On human cells, among the tested products, fungicides were the most toxicbeing cytotoxic from doses 300–600 times lower than agricultural dilutions,

> followed by herbicides (except Matin) 

> and then insecticides.

* In all cell types, fungicides were the most toxic (mean LC50 12ppm).

* The herbicide Roundup (LC50 63ppm) was next in toxicity to fungicides, 

> twice as toxic as Starane, and 

> more than 10 times as toxic as the 3 insecticides, which represent the less toxic group (mean LC50 720ppm).
