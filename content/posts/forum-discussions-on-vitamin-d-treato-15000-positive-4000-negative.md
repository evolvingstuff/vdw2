### [Treato](http://treato.com/Vitamin+D/?a=s)

 **Quick look at the negative discussions** 

D2 instead of D3

Not taking enough D3 to help

Taking Vitamin D too infrequently to help (once everyt 3 months)

Allergic to the fillers/dyes

Unable to swallow capsule

Not remember to take the supplement

Lack of Iodine with Thyroid

Got joint pain after a week - needed to add Magnesium

Vitamin D not acting quickly enough (failed to have loading dose)

Took vitamin D late at night - unable to sleep

Should get vitamin D from the sun, not supplements

 **Some discussions  should have been in the positive category** 

Less Joint Pain

Is there a problem of taking Vitamin D with milk?

I cannot tolerate milk - so how can I get Vitamin D?

Vitamin D reduced sunburning
