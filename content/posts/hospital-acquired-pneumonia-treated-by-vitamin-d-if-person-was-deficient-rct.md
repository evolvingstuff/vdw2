*  **200,000 IU of oral vitamin D helped those who got pneunomia while in hospital and were Vit D deficient ( < 10 ng)** 

* Small  **R** andomized  **C** ontrolled  **T** rial (60 in each group), so the results are not statistially significant 

* 13X more likely to have complete resolution if initially < 10 ng and were in the group getting the 200,000 IU
