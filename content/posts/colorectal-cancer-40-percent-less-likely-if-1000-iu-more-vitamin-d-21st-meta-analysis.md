#### The role of calcium and vitamin D dietary intake on risk of colorectal cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies

Cancer Causes Control. 2021 Oct 27. [doi: 10.1007/s10552-021-01512-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-021-01512-3)

Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze the current evidence about the relationships between calcium/vitamin D and CRC based on case-control studies according to sex, tumor location and continental region to complement the information obtained in meta-analyses of other designs.

Methods: The articles were located in three databases (PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS), they should be written in English language, with a case and control design and published between 1 January 1970 and 31 October 2019.

Results: There were 37 selected studies, 32 for intake of calcium, that involved 24,353 CRC cases and 30,650 controls, and 23 for that of VIT D, with a total of 19,076 cases and 36.746 controls included. For dietary calcium intake, the overall OR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.97), suggesting a reducing effect with a 6% decrease in CRC risk for every 300 mg of calcium ingested daily. 

Regarding vitamin D intake a global OR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.98) was observed, what means a  **4% decrease in the risk of CRC per 100 IU/day of vitamin D** .

Conclusion: Higher dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D are associated to a decreased risk of CRC.
