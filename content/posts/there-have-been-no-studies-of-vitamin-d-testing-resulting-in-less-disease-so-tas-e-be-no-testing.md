#### Screening for Vitamin D Deficiency: Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation

#### Many studies have shown that TAKING vitamin D results in less disease (see proof table below)

#### Task force found no studies showing that TESTING for vitamin D results in less disease

### Note:

* The studies are weighted based on the number of participants, rather than the size of vitamin D dose

* Trials using 400 IU are given the same value/weight as trials with 4,000 IU.
