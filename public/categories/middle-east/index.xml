&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency from lack of sunlight could be an unexpected long-term consequence of the Iranian revolution &lt;/p>
&lt;p>By Libby Copeland, Smithsonian magazine, May 2013&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scientists have long recognized a link between lack of sunlight and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Multiple sclerosis has skyrocketed in Tehran, increasing almost sevenfold between 1989 and 2005. In Iran’s central province of Isfahan, the incidence nearly tripled from 2005 to 2009. Now Oxford University researchers suggest, for the first time, that the 1979 Iranian Revolution may deserve some of the blame for the extraordinary jump. They say the revolutionary mandate for modest dress and head coverings for women may have inadvertently fueled the increase by limiting their exposure to sunlight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Conference – Abu Dhabi</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-conference-abu-dhabi.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-conference-abu-dhabi.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="2nd-annual-conference-in-uae-opening-speech-by-his-excellency">2nd annual conference in UAE: Opening Speech by His Excellency&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological disorder most likely caused by gene–environment interactions. There is a latitudinal gradient of MS prevalence and vitamin D deficiency has been strongly implicated in MS aetiology. Iran is a country of high levels of sunshine which has previously been considered a low–risk MS region. However, Iran has recently observed an &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#F00;">8.3–fold rise in the incidence of MS between 1989–2006&lt;/span>.&lt;/strong> 1 Previous studies have indicated a genetic predisposition to MS in the Iranian population but genetic changes are unlikely to account for the substantial rise in MS over the last few decades. Thus, we aimed to develop a novel hypothesis to explain the identification of Iran as a high–risk MS region. We believe that the influence of decreased sunshine exposure and vitamin D levels on MS risk needs to be strongly considered in the context of Iran&amp;rsquo;s history. In 1979 the Iranian Revolution took place and a country previously under great Western influences became an Islamic republic. It became a government requirement for women to wear loose–fitting clothing and the veil in public; it has previously been shown that veiled women have lower vitamin D levels compared to unveiled women. This significant cultural shift would not only potentially explain the observed increase in MS but notably, it would account for the increasing female preponderance of MS in Iran. Given that the average age of MS onset is 30 years old and that MS incidence in Iran just over 30 years following the revolution is the highest so far recorded, an association with the Iranian revolution and reduced subsequent vitamin D levels in particularly pregnant women is likely. Lifestyle changes such as urbanization and use of sunscreen may to some extent have contributed to increased vitamin D deficiency, but these are unlikely to contribute to the particularly high increase in MS observed in Iran as these changes occurred across the developed world and there is no evidence to suggest that they were particularly great in Iran. &lt;strong>A similar high incidence of MS has been observed among Iranian immigrants in countries at high latitude such as Sweden&lt;/strong> where Iranian immigrants have a reported greater prevalence of MS compared to the general population, &lt;strong>despite wearing a veil not being a requirement.&lt;/strong> Instead it is well–known that UVB exposure is lower in countries at high latitude and thus, a similar effect of increased MS incidence due to vitamin D deficiency may be observed among those in Iran wearing the veil and those resident in countries at high latitude, even if they are not wearing the veil. Therefore, vitamin D repletion is a critical public health issue for Iranians both within and outside Iran, and could help prevent an emerging MS epidemic in this population. More generally, this region is highly interesting for MS research and highlights that regions of exception to the latitudinal gradient of MS prevalence are an under–appreciated and very useful resource in evaluating MS aetiology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arabs have even lower levels of vitamin D than Jews in sunny Israel</title><link>/posts/arabs-have-even-lower-levels-of-vitamin-d-than-jews-in-sunny-israel.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/arabs-have-even-lower-levels-of-vitamin-d-than-jews-in-sunny-israel.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Diabetes in Saudi women improved with just 2,000 IU of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/diabetes-in-saudi-women-improved-with-just-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/diabetes-in-saudi-women-improved-with-just-2000-iu-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-supplementation-as-an-adjuvant-therapy-for-patients-with-t2dm-an-18-month-prospective-interventional-study">Vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant therapy for patients with T2DM: an 18-month prospective interventional study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D is cutaneously synthesized following sun exposure (vitamin D3) as well as it is derived from dietary intake (vitamin D3 and D2). Vitamin D2 and D3 are metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). This metabolite is considered the functional indicator of vitamin D stores in humans. Since Jordan latitude is 31oN, cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 should be sufficient all year round. However, many indications reveal that it is not the case. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the 25(OH)D status among Jordanians.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MS new cases increased 2.5X in 2 years in Isfahan Iran</title><link>/posts/ms-new-cases-increased-25x-in-2-years-in-isfahan-iran.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ms-new-cases-increased-25x-in-2-years-in-isfahan-iran.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="sharp-increase-in-the-incidence-and-prevalence-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-isfahan-iran">Sharp increase in the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Isfahan, Iran&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D deficiency is high in winter because of reduced exposure to sunlight. It seems that in places with high humidity and a sultry climate, exposure to sunlight in summer can be low too. This study was designed to determine the vitamin D deficiency prevalence in Sari, a city with a high humidity climate at the end of summer, and compare it to winter. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on men and women aged 10 to 70. Clustered blood samples were received from 351 subjects who participated in this study toward the end of summer, and in winter. The levels of serum vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and PTH were measured. T test and X2 were used for data analysis. Results: 351subjects (66.4% women, 33.6% men) aged 11 to 69 (mean age ± SD 37.11 ± 12.6) participated in the study.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overview Middle East and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/overview-middle-east-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/overview-middle-east-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-ahem-joy-of-summer-in-dubaihttpmideastpostscom20110623the-ahem-joy-of-summer-in-dubai">&lt;a href="http://mideastposts.com/2011/06/23/the-ahem-joy-of-summer-in-dubai/">The, ahem, ‘Joy’ of Summer in Dubai&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Ultra-orthodox Jewish lifestyle, which encourages modest dress and indoor scholarly activity, represents a risk factor for vitamin-D deficiency. Our study in healthy young males from higher education religious institutions located in the same geographical area showed frequent and severe vitamin D deficiency, strongly correlated with the degree of sun exposure. However, PTH level was usually normal.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
