# The Response of Elderly Veterans to Daily Vitamin D3 Supplementation of 2,000? IU: A Pilot Efficacy Study.

J Am Geriatr Soc. 2011 Feb 2. [doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03242.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03242.x.)

From the *Geriatrics Institute, Division of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida; †Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center and Research Service, Bruce W. Carter Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, Florida; ‡Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina; and §Stein Gerontological Institute, Miami Jewish Health Systems, Miami, Florida.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<32?ng/mL; HVD) in a population of elderly veterans and conduct a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of supplementation with cholecalciferol in correcting HVD.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

SETTING: Geriatric clinic at the Bruce W. Carter Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Miami, Florida.

PARTICIPANTS: Veterans aged 70 and older.

INTERVENTION: Oral cholecalciferol 2,000?IU daily or placebo for 6 months.

MEASUREMENTS: Serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and 24-hour urinary calcium.

RESULTS: Of the 34 participants who completed the study, 62% had HVD at baseline. In the treatment group, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level rose from 28.4±7.9?ng/mL at baseline to 42.7±10.5?ng/mL at the end of the trial, but levels remained less than 32?ng/mL in three of 17 (18%) of the participants. In the placebo group, the baseline level of 27.7±8.3?ng/mL remained unchanged (28.8±8.7?ng/mL). Supplementation did not alter serum or urinary calcium levels and did not result in any adverse events.

CONCLUSION: These initial observations suggest that, in older veterans, cholecalciferol 2,000?IU daily for 6 months is generally safe and corrects HVD in most but not all individuals.
