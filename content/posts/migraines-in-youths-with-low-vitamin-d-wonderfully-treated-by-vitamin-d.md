 **6 month trial on migraine youths of average age 13  who had < 20ng level of vitamin D  
Started with 2,000 IU for 2 months, then 600 to 1,000 IU daily for 4 months** 

 **Expect that they would have had even better success by** 

Using larger dose sizes so as to get most of them >30 ng

&nbsp; &nbsp;- Larger doses especially for those who were heavier/overweight

Adding Magnesium and Zinc

 **Also expect that the Migraines would have been reduced in a few weeks if they had used a loading dose of Vitamin D** 

 **Note: Both Migraines and Cluster headaches in adults have been very succesfully treated by Vitamin D and Magnesium**
