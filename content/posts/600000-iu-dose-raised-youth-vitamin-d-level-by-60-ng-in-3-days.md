Context: Effects of vitamin D repletion in young people with low vitamin D status have not been investigated so far. Objective: We evaluated the effect of a single massive dose of cholecalciferol on calcium metabolism at 3, 15, and 30 d, compared to baseline. 

Design and Setting: We conducted a prospective intervention study in an ambulatory care setting. 

Participants: Forty-eight young subjects with vitamin D deficiency participated in the study. 

Intervention: A single oral dose of 600,000 IU of cholecalciferol was administered to each subject. 

Main Outcome Measures: We evaluated serum changes of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, and PTH induced by a single load of cholecalciferol. 

Results: The 25(OH)D level was 

 **15.8**  +/- 6.5 ng/ml at baseline and became 

 **77.2 +/- 30.5 ng/ml at 3 d**  (P < 0.001) and 

62.4 +/- 26.1 ng/ml at 30 d (P < 0.001). 

PTH levels concomitantly decreased from 53.0 +/- 20.1 to 38.6 +/- 17.2 pg/ml at 3 d and to 43.4 +/- 14.0 pg/ml at 30 d (P < 0.001 for both). The trends were maintained in a subgroup followed up to 90 d (P < 0.001). Mean serum Ca and P significantly increased compared to baseline, whereas serum Mg decreased at 3 d. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D significantly increased from 46.8 +/- 18.9 to 97.8 +/- 38.3 pg/ml at 3 d (P < 0.001) and to 59.5 +/- 27.3 pg/ml at 60 d (P < 0.05). 

Conclusions: A single oral dose of 600,000 IU of cholecalciferol rapidly enhances 25(OH)D and reduces PTH in young people with vitamin D deficiency.
