*  **"Supplementation with omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (800 mg docosahexaenoic acid <span>[DHA]</span> and 100 mg eicosapentaenoic acid <span>[EPA]</span> per day) may reduce the risk of preterm birth among women who are low in omega-3."** 

*  **"Iodine requirements increase during pregnancy and a supplement of 150 micrograms a day is advised."** 

*  **"Vitamin D: Vitamin D supplementation may be a consideration for women with vitamin D levels lower than 50â€¯nmol/L. The evidence for vitamin D supplementation is discussed in Chapter 47. "**

There is high certainty evidence that rates of preterm birth <37 weeks (10.1% versus 8.1%%; RR 0.89, 95%CI 0.82 to 0.97; 30

RCTs, n=21,271) and early preterm birth <34 weeks (2.6% vs 1.6%; RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.44 to 0.93; 11 RCTs, n=15,750) are

lower in women receiving omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with no omega-3 (328). There is

* moderate-certainty evidence that prolonged pregnancy >42 weeks is probably increased with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (RR 1.61 95%CI 1.11 to 2.33; n=5,141; 6 RCTs) but 

* insufficient evidence to determine the effect of supplementation on induction post-term (328).

* There is high certainty evidence of a reduced risk of low birthweight (15.6% vs 14%; RR 0.90, 95%CI 0.82 to 0.99; 15 trials, n=8,449;) and 

* moderate certainty evidence for a possible reduced risk of perinatal death (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.54 to 1.03; 10 RCTs, n=7,416), 

* neonatal care admission (RR 0.92, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.03; 9 RCTs, n=6,920) and a 

* possible small increase in risk of large-for-gestational age babies (RR 1.15, 95%CI 0.97 to 1.36; 6

RCTs, n=3,722) with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation ((328)
