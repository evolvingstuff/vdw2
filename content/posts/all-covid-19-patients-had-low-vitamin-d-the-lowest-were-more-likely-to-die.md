##### Low Vitamin D Status at Admission as a Risk Factor for Poor Survival in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: An Italian Retrospective Study

J Am Coll Nutr . 2021 Feb 18;1-16. [doi: 10.1080/07315724.2021.1877580.](https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2021.1877580.)

Objective: Preliminary findings suggest a relationship between lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and incidence and severity of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status at admission and different markers of inflammation, coagulation, and sepsis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Method: We conducted a retrospective study on 137 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and available data on serum 25(OH)D levels, who were admitted to our Institution between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 78; 57%) and non-survivors (n = 59; 43%).

Results: At admission, all patients showed hypovitaminosis D. Median total serum 25(OH)D levels at admission were significantly higher in  **survivors than non-survivors (12 ng/mL vs 8 ng/mL; p < 0.01).**  

Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher median levels of 

* white blood cell (WBC) count, 

* neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR), 

* high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), 

* ferritin, 

* interleukin 6 (IL-6), 

* D-dimer, 

* fibrinogen, and 

* procalcitonin (PCT) 

compared to survivors at three different time points during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis performed by a logistic regression model, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely associated with risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality ( **odds ratio, 0.91** ; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.98; p = 0.01). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, hsCRP, NLR, ferritin, and D-dimer were the best predictive biomarkers for poor prognosis of COVID-19, whereas IL-6, PCT, fibrinogen, 25(OH)D, WBC count, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) may serve as supportive biomarkers for worse clinical course of the disease.

Conclusions: We found a markedly high prevalence (100%) of hypovitaminosis D in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, suggesting a possible role of low vitamin D status in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent hospitalization. The inverse association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of in-hospital mortality observed in our cohort suggests that a lower vitamin D status upon admission may represent a modifiable and independent risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19.
