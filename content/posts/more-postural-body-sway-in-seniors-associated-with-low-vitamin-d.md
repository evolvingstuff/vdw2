### Vitamin D deficiency intensifies deterioration of risk factors, such as male sex and absence of vision, leading to increased postural body sway.

Gait Posture. 2013 Jul 15. pii: S0966-6362(13)00300-7. [doi: 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.06.017.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2013.06.017.) Krause M, Anschütz W, Vettorazzi E, Breer S, Amling M amling@uke.de, Barvencik F.

INTRODUCTION: Due to inconsistent findings, the influence of vitamin D on postural body sway (PBS) is currently under debate. This study evaluated the impact of vitamin D on PBS with regards to different foot positions and eye opening states in community-dwelling older individuals.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we assessed PBS in 342 older individuals (264 females <span>[average age (±SD): 68.3±9.0 years]</span>, 78 males <span>[65.7±9.6 years]</span>). A detailed medical history and vitamin D level were obtained for each individual. Fall risk was evaluated using the New York-Presbyterian Fall Risk Assessment Tool (NY PFRA). PBS parameters (area, distance, velocity, frequency) were evaluated on a pressure plate with feet in closed stance (CS) or hip-width stance (HWS), open eyes and closed eyes. Statistical analysis included logarithmic mixed models for repeated measures with the MIXED model procedure to test the influence of vitamin D (categorized in <10μg/l, 10-20μg/l, 21-30μg/l, >30μg/l), foot position, eye opening state, age, sex and frequency of physical activity on PBS.

RESULTS: Vitamin D was not an independent risk factor for falls experienced in the last 12 months. Nonetheless,  **PBS was higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency (<10μg/l) in HWS (A/P p=0.028 and area p=0.037)** . Additionally, vitamin D deficiency intensified the deleterious effects of male sex (distance p=0.002) and absence of vision (area p<0.001) on PBS.

CONCLUSION: Independent risk factors for increased PBS like male sex and absence of vision are additionally compromised by vitamin D deficiency.
