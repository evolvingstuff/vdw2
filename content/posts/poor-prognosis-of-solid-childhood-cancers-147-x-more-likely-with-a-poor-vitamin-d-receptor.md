#### Immunohistochemical Detection of the Presence of Vitamin D Receptor in Childhood Solid Tumors

Cancers (Basel). 2022 Jul 6;14(14):3295. [doi: 10.3390/cancers14143295.](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14143295.)

Background: Our previous work has shown a correlation between lower vitamin D levels in children with cancer and adverse prognosis. It suggests that supplying vitamin D is reasonable. VDR expression in childhood solid tumors has been linked to tumor characteristics and patient survival in only a few studies.

Methods: For this study, 177 children with solid tumors were selected whose biopsies and tumor tissue formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were available for immunohistochemical analysis at Semmelweis University, Budapest (Hungary).

Results: We found that non-significant VDR expression was associated with a significantly less favorable prognosis (p = 0.0061) in the examined childhood solid tumors. There was a clinically significant association; non-significant VDR expression had more than 14-fold odds of an unfavorable prognosis ( **OR = 14.74** ). The rate of VDR expression differed significantly between tumor types (p  <0.0001).

Conclusion: In conclusion, VDR expression measured by IHC staining is inversely associated with aggressive characteristics in different childhood cancers. The downregulation of VDR expression in more aggressive childhood cancers suggests that functional vitamin D activity may slow or block cancer progression.

#### Suspect increased incidence of poor VDR in past 50 years

 **Now a person can survive a poor VDR and pass a poor VDR gene onto their offspring** 

 **This lack of the survival of the fittest may be a major reason for the increase of health problems, such as childhood cancers** 

Have been unable to find studies of trends of VDR incidence
