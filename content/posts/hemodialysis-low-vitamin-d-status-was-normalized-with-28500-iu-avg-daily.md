BACKGROUND:  Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among hemodialysis patients, but little data exist in support of an optimal repletion regimen.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain the efficacy of weekly very-high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) in correcting vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in patients with stage 5D chronic kidney disease.

DESIGN: We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled pilot study that compared placebo with very high doses of oral cholecalciferol for 3 wk (200,000 IU/wk) in hemodialysis patients. We examined the rate of correction of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency and the effect of treatment on markers of mineral metabolism and routine laboratory variables.Results: Twenty-seven subjects received placebo, and 25 received cholecalciferol. The majority (94%) of subjects had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations <30 ng/mL. Study groups were similar with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, with the exception of hemoglobin concentrations, which were lower in the cholecalciferol-treated group (P < 0.04). At follow-up, 90.5% of subjects treated with cholecalciferol achieved serum 25(OH)D concentrations ?30 ng/mL in contrast to 13.6% of the placebo group. There were no significant changes in serum calcium, phosphate, or intact parathyroid hormone during the study.

CONCLUSION: Short-term, high-dose oral cholecalciferol treatment of vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients appears to be effective and with no evidence of toxic effects. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00912782.

### 50,000 IU weekly helped hemodialysis patients after transplant - Oct 2014

 **Effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on inflammation and cellular alloimmunity in hemodialysis patients: data from a randomized controlled pilot trial.** 

PLoS One. 2014 Oct 8;9(10):e109998. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0109998.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109998.) eCollection 2014.

BACKGROUND:

Memory T-cells are mediators of transplant injury, and no therapy is known to prevent the development of cross-reactive memory alloimmunity. Activated vitamin D is immunomodulatory, and vitamin D deficiency, common in hemodialysis patients awaiting transplantation, is associated with a heightened alloimmune response. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that vitamin D3 supplementation would prevent alloreactive T-cell memory formation in vitamin D-deficient hemodialysis patients.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:

We performed a 12-month single-center pilot randomized, controlled trial of 50,000 IU/week of cholecalciferol (D3) versus no supplementation in 96 hemodialysis patients with serum 25(OH)D<25 ng/mL, measuring effects on serum 25(OH)D and phenotypic and functional properties of T-cells. Participants were randomized 2:1 to active treatment versus control. D3 supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D at 6 weeks (13.5 <span>[11.2]</span> ng/mL to 42.5 <span>[18.5]</span> ng/mL, p<0.001) and for the duration of the study. No episodes of sustained hypercalcemia occurred in either group. Results of IFNγ ELISPOT-based panel of reactive T-cell assays (PRT), quantifying alloreactive memory, demonstrated greater increases in the controls over 1 year compared to the treatment group (delta PRT in treatment 104.8+/-330.8 vs 252.9+/-431.3 in control), but these changes in PRT between groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.25).

CONCLUSIONS:

D3 supplements are safe, effective at treating vitamin D deficiency, and may prevent time-dependent increases in T-cell alloimmunity in hemodialysis patients, but their effects on alloimmunity need to be confirmed in larger studies. These findings support the routine supplementation of vitamin D-deficient transplant candidates on hemodialysis and highlight the need for large-scale prospective studies of vitamin D supplementation in transplant candidates and recipients.
