   * "Salk researchers and collaborators show how the protein damages cells, confirming COVID-19 as a primarily vascular disease"

   * apparently the research was preprinted Dec 4, then peerprinted March 31 - above

   * "In the new study, the researchers created a “pseudovirus” that was surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins, but did not contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model—proving that the spike protein alone was enough to cause disease. Tissue samples showed inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls.'

   * "The team then replicated this process in the lab, exposing healthy endothelial cells (which line arteries) to the spike protein. They showed that the spike protein damaged the cells by binding ACE2. This binding disrupted ACE2’s molecular signaling to mitochondria (organelles that generate energy for cells), causing the mitochondria to become damaged and fragmented."

 **Now the breadth of the COVID-19 and perhaps long-haul symptoms have a context**

   *  **Common signs and symptoms that linger over time include:** 

   * Fatigue, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Cough, Joint pain, Chest pain. Memory, concentration or sleep problems

   * Muscle pain or headache, Fast or pounding heartbeat. Loss of smell or taste. Depression or anxiety

   * Fever, Dizziness when you stand. Worsened symptoms after physical or mental activities

 **Wonder how much of that is inflammation**
