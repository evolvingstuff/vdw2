For 1248 women every 100 IU additional Vitamin D during 1st and 2nd trimesters

Resulted in 20% less chance of allergic rhinitis and allergic sensitization at age 7

Weak statistical significance:(r = -0.03 to 0.53).  (strong = -0.05)

VitaminDWiki comments: 

1. Seems like more 100 IU vitamin D would be needed to make a difference

1. If true, vitamin D should be added earlier in pregnancy (often started at 20th week)

BACKGROUND:

The role of early-life vitamin D in childhood allergy is controversial.

OBJECTIVE:

We sought to assess vitamin D exposure in early life by multiple modalities and ascertain its association with childhood allergic rhinitis and allergic sensitization.

METHODS:

One thousand two hundred forty-eight mother-child pairs from a US prebirth cohort unselected for any disease were studied. Vitamin D exposure was assessed by measures of maternal intake during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels in mothers during pregnancy, cord blood, and children at school age (median age, 7.7 years; interquartile range, 1.0 years). Tests for associations between vitamin D exposure with ever allergic rhinitis, serum total IgE level, and allergen sensitization at school age were conducted.

RESULTS:

The correlations between maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy and serum 25(OH)D levels in pregnant mothers, cord blood, and children at school age were  **weak to moderate**  (r = -0.03 to 0.53). 

Each 100 IU/d of food-based vitamin D intake during the first and second trimesters (equivalent to the amount of vitamin D in an 8 - ounce serving of milk) was associated with 21% and 20% reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age (odds ratios of 0.79 <span>[95% CI, 0.67-0.92]</span> and 0.80 <span>[95% CI, 0.68-0.93]</span>), respectively. 

There were no associations between maternal supplemental vitamin D intake or serum 25(OH)D levels at any time point with ever allergic rhinitis. There were no associations between any vitamin D exposure and serum total IgE level or allergen sensitization at school age.

CONCLUSIONS:

Inclusion of foods containing vitamin D in maternal diets during pregnancy may have beneficial effects on childhood allergic rhinitis.
