 **Video and transcript** 

* Limbic hyperactivity or dysfunction appears to be a foundational core of the dysfunction and challenges associated with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM)and a number of other conditions

* Your limbic system is the emotional and reactive part of your brain, responsible for filtering sensory and emotional information, and sorting that information into two distinct categories: safe or unsafe

* When neurons along that neural network are damaged or not working functionally, your limbic system can start to categorize information that would not normally be considered dangerous as life-threatening; essentially, your brain gets stuck in the fight-flight-or-freeze mechanism

* Limbic retraining helps you retrain your limbic system to respond in a functional manner, thereby reducing symptoms

* Remember, though, even if your symptoms dissipate through limbic retraining, you still need to mitigate the cellular injury that toxic chemicals, mold or EMF exposure has inflicted

She had written a book on the topic in 2014
