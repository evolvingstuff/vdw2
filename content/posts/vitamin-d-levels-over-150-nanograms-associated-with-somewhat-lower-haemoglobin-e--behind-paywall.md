#### The effect of hypervitaminosis D and intoxication on haematological parameters hemogram parameters in patients with very high vitamin D levels

Background: This study aims to compare the haematological parameters of patients with very high and normal 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 (25(OH)D3) levels.

Methods: This study was designed as a retrospective cross-sectional study. The patients were divided into three groups according to their 25(OH)D3 levels: groups 1, 2, and 3 are patients with normal 25(OH)D3 levels (30-88 ng/mL), hypervitaminosis D (89-149 ng/mL) and vitamin D intoxication (>150 ng/mL), respectively. According to vitamin D levels, statistical analysis was performed by comparing the biochemical and haematological data between the groups.

Results: This study evaluated 120 patients (40 patients) in three equal groups. A statistically significant difference was found between the three groups in haemoglobin (p = 0.03), haematocrit (p = 0.01), red blood cell levels (p = 0.03), leukocyte count (p < 0.001), neutrophil count (p < 0.001), lymphocyte count (p = 0.006), mean platelet volume (p = 0.04), and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.03). 

In post hoc analysis, 

* haemoglobin, 

* haematocrit and 

* RBC 

were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 3 (post hoc Tukey, p < 0.05). A statistically significant negative correlation was noted between 25(OH)D3 level and haemoglobin (r = -0.236), haemotocrit (r = -0.230), and red blood cell (r = -0.265) levels.

Conclusions: Vitamin D intoxication has been observed to affect haemoglobin, haematocrit, and RBC levels negatively. However, more studies are needed to clarify the effects and mechanisms of high vitamin D levels on the haematopoietic system.
