#### [Covid-19 Is Killing Hundreds of Pregnant Women and Babies in Brazil](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-is-killing-hundreds-of-pregnant-women-and-babies-in-brazil-11622113201?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1%20) Wall Street Journal  May 27, 2021

* “… Brazil’s maternal and infant mortality rates from the disease appear to be far higher than in many other countries such as the U.S., researchers said.”

* “New variants like the P.1 strain that emerged in the Amazon may make the disease even more risky for pregnant women in Brazil, researchers say. Studies have shown the strain to be up to 2.2 times more contagious than previous versions and possibly more deadly—a hypothesis researchers are still investigating. Another factor could be that prenatal care has virtually disappeared in Brazil thanks to an overwhelmed hospital system”

* “Based on interactions with gynecologists in different parts of  **India** , he says about  **30% to 40% of pregnant women**  with Covid-19 are symptomatic in the latest surge compared with about  **15%**  in the previous year’s surge. “
