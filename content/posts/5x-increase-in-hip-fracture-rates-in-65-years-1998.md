### Long-term trends in hip fracture prevalence: the influence of hip fracture incidence and survival.

Osteoporos Int. 1998;8(1):68-74.

Melton LJ 3rd, Therneau TM, Larson DR.

Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.

In this population-based descriptive study covering the 65-year period, 1928-92, there was a  **5-fold increase in hip fracture**  prevalence among Rochester, Minnesota residents between 1928-42 and 1973-82, from 135.8 to 675.8 per 100,000. This change was dictated almost entirely by an increase in the incidence of first hip fractures due to moderate trauma (n = 2058) that was observed among Rochester women through 1950, and among men through 1980, that affected all age groups. Declining incidence rates thereafter led to a 9% fall in hip fracture prevalence from 1973-82 to 1983-92 to a rate of 612.7 per 100,000. A 13.7-year increase in age at first hip fracture over the study period was accounted for by aging of the underlying population, and a comparable 13.9-year increase in the age at death following hip fracture appeared to result from improved survival in the population generally. Thus, trends in hip fracture prevalence were mainly determined by changes in incidence  **rather than relative changes in age at onset and death following hip fracture.**

## This abstract appears to say:

The rate of hip fracture has increased 5X for those of the same age.

## Wonder how much of the increase is due to decrease in nutrients:

*  **Vitamin D3**  - which maintains

In a 2004 letter published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Dr. Ott wrote:

“Many people believe that these drugs are ‘bone builders,’ but the evidence shows they are actually  **bone hardeners** ”

## How I got interested in this line of reasoning

[ **Osteoporosis Myth: The Dangers of High Bone Mineral Density** ](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/osteoporosis-myth-dangers-high-bone-mineral-density) Green MedInfo - Aug 2012

Made the case for reduction of bone density it just feature of aging

 **<span style="color:#F00;">Failed to notice that aging is also associated with reduction in vitamin D and Magnesium and perhaps Vitamin K2</span>** 

 **That article got me to wondering: Were there fewer hip fractures in the past ?**
