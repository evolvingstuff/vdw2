# Did not take enough

#### Some medical problems need more than 5,000 IU to get any results

#### Some peoples, like Eskimos/Inuit, have intestinal systems evolved to extract less vitamin D [ClICK HERE for Hypothesis](https://VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Eskimos+evolved+to+get+and+limit+Vitamin+D+from+food)

#### People who are [obese](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Overview%3A+Obesity+and+Vitamin+D) get approximately 1/2 the blood level of increase for a given dose of vitamin D

#### People who are very deficient need to first replenish their vitamin D levels, sometimes with a high single or short term dose, before going on a maintenance dose

### Very deficient include seniors, submariners, women wearing burkas, people avoiding the sun !![CLICK HERE](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=4&deep=off)

## Had taken vitamin D2 instead of vitamin D3

#### Doctors in the US can only prescribe D2, which lasts about 1/2 as long in the blood stream and in many cases seems to be 1/3 as useful

## Had been consuming something else which had decreased level of vitamin D in the blood

#### Vitamin A, Statins, Chemotherapy, smoking, anti-epileptic meds, etc [CLICK HERE](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=59&deep=off) or [HERE](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=26&deep=off)

## Medical complications

#### Malabsorption (short bowel, pancreatitis, IBD, celiac sprue, bariatric surgery,..)

#### Liver disease or failure (liver converts supplement into what is used in the blood)

#### In hospital - 57% of seniors are deficient

## Poor vitamin D availability

#### Some pills have as little as 10%.  oil pills are consistently good
