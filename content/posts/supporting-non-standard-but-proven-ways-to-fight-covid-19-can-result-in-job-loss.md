Many ways have been proposed to fight COVID-19.

Some of the ways have been proven to be effective by both observations and clinical trials

However, most 

- professional medical organizations, 

- vaccine manufacturers, and 

- governments 

appear to down-play or reject alternatives.

In a few cases, the rejection also resulted in threatening or firing one of the proponents.

 **This is not science-based medicine. &nbsp; &nbsp; This is politics-based or dollar-based medicine** 

In the past, doctors were encouraged to try new treatments.

If the treatment worked, they were rewarded in many ways.

Now, however, doctors are actively discouraged from exploring treatments that are not the standard of practice

 **[Clipped from Real Clear Politics March 10, 2021](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2021/03/10/censorship_kills_the_shunning_of_a_covid_therapeutic_145376.html)** 

I’ve experienced such censorship firsthand. Early in the pandemic, my research led me to testify in the Senate that corticosteroids were life-saving against COVID-19, when all national and international health care agencies recommended against them. My recommendations were criticized, ignored and resisted such that I felt  **forced to resign my faculty position** . Only later did a [large study](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) from Oxford University find they were indeed life-saving. Overnight, they became the standard of care worldwide. More recently, we identified through dozens of trials that the drug ivermectin leads to large reductions in transmission, mortality, and time to clinical recovery. After testifying to this fact in a second Senate appearance — the video of which was [removed by YouTube](https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-cancels-the-u-s-senate-11612288061) after garnering over 8 million views — **I was forced to leave another position.**

I-Mask+. is centered around  **ivermectin** , a well-known, FDA-approved anti-parasite drug that has been used successfully for more than four decades to treat onchocerciasis “river blindness” and other parasitic diseases. It is one of the safest drugs known. It is on the WHO’s list of essential medicines, has been given 3.7 billion times around the globe,
