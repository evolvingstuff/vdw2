Vitamin D deficiency actives renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which affects cardiovascular system. Activation of RAAS is associated with pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Relation between vitamin D deficiency and PHT could be therefore suggested. In our study we compared pulmonary artery pressure between vitamin D deficiency and control groups. 115 consecutive patients (average age: 61.86 ± 5.86) who have detected very low vitamin D (vitamin D levels < 10 ng/ml) were enrolled. 117 age matched persons (average age: 61.74 ± 5.99) were selected as the control group. All groups underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Routine biochemical measurement of 25-OH vitamin D and parathormon (PTH) levels were performed. Baseline characteristics of the study groups were comparable. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) of patients in the low vitamin D group was higher than the control groups. As a result our study, a relation between vitamin D deficiency and pulmonary artery hypertension was revealed.
