# Clipped Sept 2011 from [Medline Plus](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/929.html)

# Effective for...

* Treating conditions that cause weak and painful bones (osteomalacia).

* Low levels of phosphate in the blood (familial hypophosphatemia).

* Low levels of phosphate in the blood due to a disease called Fanconi syndrome.

* Psoriasis (with a specialized prescription-only form of vitamin D).

* Low blood calcium levels because of a low parathyroid thyroid hormone levels.

* Helping prevent low calcium and bone loss (renal osteodystrophy) in people with kidney failure.

* Rickets.

* Vitamin D deficiency.

# Likely effective for...

* Treating osteoporosis (weak bones). Taking a specific form of vitamin D called cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) along with calcium seems to help prevent bone loss and bone breaks.

* Preventing falls in older people. Researchers noticed that people who don’t have enough vitamin D tend to fall more often than other people. 

> They found that taking a vitamin D supplement reduces the risk of falling by up to 22%. 

> Higher doses of vitamin D are more effective than lower doses. 

> One study found that taking 800 IU of vitamin D reduced the risk of falling, but lower doses didn’t.

* Also, vitamin D, in combination with calcium, but not calcium alone, may  **prevent falls**  by decreasing body sway and blood pressure. 

> This combination prevents more falls in women than men.

* Reducing bone loss in people taking drugs called corticosteroids.

# Possibly effective for...

* Reducing the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). Studies show taking vitamin D seems to reduce women’s risk of getting MS by up to 40%. 

> Taking at least 400 IU per day, the amount typically found in a multivitamin supplement, seems to work the best.

*  **Preventing cancer.**  Some research shows that people who take a high-dose vitamin D supplement plus calcium might have a lower chance of developing cancer of any type.

* Weight loss. Women taking calcium plus vitamin D are more likely to lose weight and maintain their weight. 

> But this benefit is mainly in women who didn’t get enough calcium before they started taking supplements.

* Flu. Some research in school aged children show that taking a vitamin D supplement during winter might reduce the chance of getting seasonal flu.

* Reducing the risk of rheumatoid arthritis in older women.

* Reducing bone loss in women with a condition called hyperparathyroidism.

* Preventing tooth loss in the elderly.

# Possibly ineffective for...

* Breast cancer. Many studies have looked at whether vitamin D can help prevent breast cancer, but their results have not always agreed. 

> The best evidence to date comes from a large study called the Women’s Health Initiative, which found that taking  **400 IU**  of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium per day does not seem to lower the chance of getting breast cancer. 

> The possibility remains that high doses of vitamin D might lower breast cancer risk in younger women. But the doses needed would be so high that they might not be safe.

* High blood pressure.

* Improving muscle strength in older adults.

* Preventing bone loss in people with kidney transplants.

# Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...

* Heart disease. Research suggests that people with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are much more likely to develop heart disease, including heart failure, than people with higher vitamin D levels. However, taking vitamin D does not seem to extend the life of people with heart failure.

* High cholesterol. People with lower vitamin D levels seem to be much more likely to have high cholesterol than people with higher vitamin D levels. 

> Limited research shows that taking calcium plus vitamin D daily, in combination with a low-calorie diet, significantly raises “good (HDL) cholesterol” and lowers “bad (LDL) cholesterol” in overweight women. But taking calcium plus vitamin D alone, does not reduce LDL cholesterol levels.

* Gum disease. Higher blood levels of vitamin D seem to be linked with a reduced risk of gum disease in people 50 years of age or older. 

> But, this doesn’t seem to be true for adults younger than 50.

* Diabetes. People with lower vitamin D levels are significantly more likely to have type 2 diabetes compared to people with higher vitamin D levels. 

> But, there is no reliable evidence that taking vitamin D supplements can treat or prevent type 2 diabetes.

* Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). There is some evidence that getting more vitamin D from the diet might help to prevent PMS or reduce symptoms. 

> Taking vitamin D supplements might help reduce symptoms but doesn't seem to help prevent PMS.

* A blood cell disease called myelodysplastic syndrome.

* A muscle disease called proximal myopathy.

* Colorectal cancer.

* Warts.

* Bronchitis.

* Asthma.

* Breathing disorders.

* Metabolic syndrome.

* Muscle pain caused by medications called "statins."

* Vaginal atrophy.

* Other conditions.

## Note: The above is generally based on < 2,000 IU of vitamin D.

## Much higher doses are needed for TREATMENT
