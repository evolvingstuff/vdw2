Background & aims: Approximately 5%-10% of the population in most geographical regions suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which creates a significant burden on individual patients, their families, and society. Recent advances in IBS therapies have indicated that vitamin D supplementation is potential to relieve its symptoms, but evidence of this is lacking. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effect of vitamin D on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in IBS patients.

Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from their inception to March 2022. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 12.0 and Review Manager 5.4, and statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. The pooled results are presented as weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results: The meta-analysis including 6 randomized controlled trials (RCT) with 572 patients found a significant difference in IBS symptom severity score (WMD, -34.88; 95% CI, -62.48 to -7.27; P = 0.013; random-effects model) but no significant difference in IBS quality of life score (WMD, 3.33; 95% CI, -5.12 to -11.77; P = 0.440; random-effects model).

Conclusions: Overall, IBS patients may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to reduce the GI symptoms.
