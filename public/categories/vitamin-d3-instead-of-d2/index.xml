&lt;p>Objective: We investigated whether an increase in vitamin D levels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus was associated with improvement in disease activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: 1006 SLE patients were followed over 128 weeks. SLE patients with low levels of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (&amp;lt;40 ng/mL) were supplemented with 50,000 units Vitamin D2 weekly, with Ca/D3 200 units twice daily. Longitudinal regression models were used to estimate the association between levels of vitamin D and various measures of disease activity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some Infants with 400 IU daily of Vitamin D2 actually decreased serum levels</title><link>/posts/some-infants-with-400-iu-daily-of-vitamin-d2-actually-decreased-serum-levels.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/some-infants-with-400-iu-daily-of-vitamin-d2-actually-decreased-serum-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-change-in-plasma-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-did-not-differ-between-breast-fed-infants-that-received-a-daily-supplement-of-ergocalciferol-or-cholecalciferol-for-3-months">The change in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D did not differ between breast-fed infants that received a daily supplement of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol for 3 months.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The biological equivalency of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) has been debated; several comparisons have appeared in the adult literature but are scarce in pediatrics. The objective of this study was to compare increases in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> concentrations and attainment of 50 and 75 mol/L status cutoffs following 3 mo of daily supplementation with D2 compared with D3. Healthy, breast-fed, 1-mo-old infants (n = 52) received 10 μg (400 ic) of either D2 or D3 daily. At 1 and 4 mo of age, plasma 25-hydroxyergocalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) and total 25(OH)D by chemiluminescent immunoassay (DiaSorin Liaison). Data were analyzed using t tests and χ² by intent to treat. A total of 23% of infants were deficient (≤24.9 nmol/L) at baseline and 2% at follow-up on the basis of LC-MS/MS. At 4 mo, 96% were breastfed and there were no differences in compliance, breastfeeding rates, or sun exposure among groups. The change in total 25(OH)D measured by LC-MS/MS did not differ between the D2 (17.6 ± 26.7 nmol/L) and D3 (22.2 ± 20.2 nmol/L) groups. In the combined groups, the baseline plasma 25(OH)D concentration was inversely related to the change in total 25(OH)D (r = -0.52; P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>D2 may reduce academic performance</title><link>/posts/d2-may-reduce-academic-performance.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/d2-may-reduce-academic-performance.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="association-of-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-d-with-academic-performance-in-childhood-findings-from-a-prospective-birth-cohort">Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ and D₂ with academic performance in childhood: findings from a prospective birth cohort.&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are widespread in many countries. We review the evidence pertaining to its prevention and treatment. Deficiency may be adequately treated with many different therapeutic regimens of either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, owing to the high therapeutic index of both compounds. Nevertheless, the current evidence suggests that regular dosing with oral cholecalciferol (e.g., 60,000 IU weekly) may have slight advantages over other regimens when replenishing vitamin D stores following deficiency. For long-term supplementation, smaller regular doses, such as cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily, or 10,000 IU weekly, are suitable. Giving reliable and specific advice about appropriate sunlight exposure remains difficult because of differing interindividual skin pigmentation and variable sunlight UVB content at different latitudes, at different times of year, and in different terrestrial environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D3 far better than D2 at raising infant vitamin D blood levels</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d3-far-better-than-d2-at-raising-infant-vitamin-d-blood-levels.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d3-far-better-than-d2-at-raising-infant-vitamin-d-blood-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-change-in-plasma-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-did-not-differ-between-breast-fed-infants-that-received-a-daily-supplement-of-ergocalciferol-or-cholecalciferol-for-3-months">The Change in Plasma 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Did Not Differ between Breast-Fed Infants That Received a Daily Supplement of Ergocalciferol or Cholecalciferol for 3 Months.&lt;/h3>

Recent studies in patients without impaired kidney function suggest that vitamin D3 is more efficient than vitamin D2 in correcting vitamin D insufficiency.

&lt;p>The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by a progressive decrease in the ability to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Pharmacological replacement with active vitamin D therefore has been a cornerstone of secondary hyperparathyroidism therapy in the end-stage renal disease population treated by long-term dialysis. Recent evidence suggests that extrarenal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may have significant biological roles beyond those traditionally ascribed to vitamin D. Furthermore, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are common in patients with all stages of CKD. This article focuses on the role of nutritional vitamin D replacement in CKD and aims to review vitamin D biology and summarize the existing literature regarding nutritional vitamin D replacement in these populations. Based on the current state of the evidence, we provide suggestions for clinical practice and address areas of uncertainty that need further research.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D3 much better than D2 for loading doses– meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d3-much-better-than-d2-for-loading-doses-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d3-much-better-than-d2-for-loading-doses-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="comparison-of-vitamin-d2-and-vitamin-d3-supplementation-in-raising-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-status-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-123">Comparison of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 supplementation in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status: a systematic review and meta-analysis 1,2,3&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>There is little doubt that vitamin D deficiency across all age groups in Europe is a problem. Low vitamin D status arises due to limited, if any, dermal synthesis during the winter months at latitudes above 40°N, putting increased importance on dietary supply of the vitamin. However, dietary intakes by most populations are low due to the limited supply of vitamin D-rich foods in the food chain. Thus strategies that effectively address this public health issue are urgently required. It has been emphasized and re-emphasized that there are only a limited number of public health strategies available to correct low dietary vitamin D intake:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>600,000 IU of vitamin D2 every 4 months for decades in East Germany – 1987</title><link>/posts/600000-iu-of-vitamin-d2-every-4-months-for-decades-in-east-germany-1987.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/600000-iu-of-vitamin-d2-every-4-months-for-decades-in-east-germany-1987.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="intermittent-high-dose-vitamin-d-prophylaxis-during-infancy-effect-on-vitamin-d-metabolites-calcium-and-phosphorus">Intermittent high-dose vitamin D prophylaxis during infancy: effect on vitamin D metabolites, calcium, and phosphorus.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In infants receiving intermittent high dose vitamin D prophylaxis (600,000 IU ergocalciferol per dose orally) every 3-5 mo, the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) were determined before and 2 wk after each dose. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D (OHD) concentrations increased to well above normal but the values returned to the normal range before each subsequent dose. The 24,25- and 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D (&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>2D) levels followed a pattern similar to that of 25-OHD, and both were closely related to the latter (r = 0.85, p less than 0.005, and r = 0.84, p less than 0.005, respectively). The 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations did not vary in a consistent pattern and remained largely within the normal range. All infants had normal Ca levels before the first dose but 14 infants (34%) later had one or both Ca values above the upper normal limit of 2.80 mmol/L (2.81-3.32 mmol/L), indicating that the vitamin D doses were excessive despite the lack of accumulative increases in serum vitamin D concentrations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D2 treatment reduced the Vitamin D3 blood test results by half</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d2-treatment-reduced-the-vitamin-d3-blood-test-results-by-half.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d2-treatment-reduced-the-vitamin-d3-blood-test-results-by-half.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="effect-of-treatment-with-50000-iu-vitamin-d2-every-other-week-on-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d2-25-hydroxyvitamin-d3-and-total-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-in-a-clinical-setting">Effect of treatment with 50,000 IU Vitamin D2 every other week on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a clinical setting.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This review will summarize the impact of vitamin D deficiency on muscle health. Mechanistic evidence regarding the presence of the specific vitamin D receptor in muscle tissue and muscle biopsy abnormalities observed with deficiency will be reviewed, as well as molecular and non-molecular effects of vitamin D in muscle tissue. At the clinical level, the evidence from randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation on functional improvement and fall reduction will be summarized. Further, the manuscript will discuss whether vitamin D effects on fall prevention modulate in part its benefit on fracture prevention and why fall prevention is essential in fracture prevention at higher age. Finally, trial and epidemiological data will be reviewed to assess desirable serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for optimal muscle health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MS worse with Vitamin D2</title><link>/posts/ms-worse-with-vitamin-d2.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ms-worse-with-vitamin-d2.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="multiple-sclerosis-and-vitamin-dhttpwwwneurologyorgcontent7717e99short">&lt;a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/77/17/e99.short">Multiple sclerosis and vitamin D&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>For the primate species that have been studied, vitamin D is not an essential component of the diet as long as they have adequate exposure to sunlight (Holick, 1994). But it appears to be essential in the tissues of most primates for maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and for normal bone mineralization (Holick, 1996). In the absence of solar exposure, these primates must be exposed to sources of artificial light of appropriate wavelengths or must receive sufficient vitamin D in the diet. In this review we will try to put into perspective what is known about vitamin D in humans and to compare this information with what is known about its role in nonhuman primates and other vertebrates.!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D3 better than D2</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d3-better-than-d2.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d3-better-than-d2.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d3-is-more-potent-than-vitamin-d2-in-humans">Vitamin D(3) is more potent than vitamin D(2) in humans.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There remains uncertainty regarding the appropriate therapeutic management of hip fracture patients. The primary aim of our study was to examine whether large loading doses in addition to daily vitamin D offered any advantage over a simple daily low-dose vitamin D regimen for increasing vitamin D levels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>10 million IU of vitamin D3 for cows was great unless had vitamin D2</title><link>/posts/10-million-iu-of-vitamin-d3-for-cows-was-great-unless-had-vitamin-d2.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/10-million-iu-of-vitamin-d3-for-cows-was-great-unless-had-vitamin-d2.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Vitamin D2 patent granted to prevent hair loss during chemotherapy – 2002</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d2-patent-granted-to-prevent-hair-loss-during-chemotherapy-2002.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d2-patent-granted-to-prevent-hair-loss-during-chemotherapy-2002.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wo2002030430-use-of-vitamin-d2-compounds-for-alopeciahttpwwwwipointpatentscopesearchendetailjsfdocidwo2002030430recnum1maxrecofficeprevfiltersortoptionquerystringtabpctbiblio20">&lt;a href="http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2002030430&amp;amp;recNum=1&amp;amp;maxRec=&amp;amp;office=&amp;amp;prevFilter=&amp;amp;sortOption=&amp;amp;queryString=&amp;amp;tab=PCT+Biblio%20">(WO2002030430) USE OF VITAMIN D2 COMPOUNDS FOR ALOPECIA&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>VANCOUVER, B.C.—Paricalcitol is more effective than ergocalciferol at lowering parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4 and who have vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism, data suggest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, the study revealed that the ergocalciferol dosing regimen advocated by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines is often ineffective at correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> levels.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>50000 IU vitamin D2 weekly helped blacks with heart problems</title><link>/posts/50000-iu-vitamin-d2-weekly-helped-blacks-with-heart-problems.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/50000-iu-vitamin-d2-weekly-helped-blacks-with-heart-problems.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="supplemental-vitamin-d-and-calcium-in-the-management-of-african-americans-with-heart-failure-having-hypovitaminosis-d">Supplemental vitamin D and calcium in the management of African Americans with heart failure having hypovitaminosis D.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>INTRODUCTION: A dyshomeostasis of macro- and micronutrients, including vitamin D and oxidative stress, are common pathophysiologic features in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In African Americans (AA) with CHF, reductions in plasma 25(OH)D are of moderate-to-marked severity (&amp;lt;20 ng/mL) and may be accompanied by ionized hypocalcemia with compensatory increases in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH). The management of hypovitaminosis D in AA with CHF has not been established.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sarcoidosis – low on vitamin D3 but OK or high level of D2</title><link>/posts/sarcoidosis-low-on-vitamin-d3-but-ok-or-high-level-of-d2.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sarcoidosis-low-on-vitamin-d3-but-ok-or-high-level-of-d2.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="bone-health-issues-in-sarcoidosis">Bone Health Issues in Sarcoidosis.&lt;/h1>
