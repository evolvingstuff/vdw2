Vitamin D has been a topic of much research interest and controversy, and evidence is mixed concerning its preventive effects and health benefits. The purpose of our study was to explore the decision-making strategies used by both primary care providers and community members surrounding vitamin D in relation to uncertainty management theory. We conducted semistructured interviews with primary care providers (n = 7) and focus groups with community members (n = 89), and transcribed and coded using the constant comparative method. 

Themes for  **providers**  included 

* awareness, 

* uncertainty, 

* patient role, 

* responsibility, 

* skepticism, 

* uncertainty management, and 

* evolving perceptions. 

 **Community member**  focus group themes included 

* uncertainty, 

* information sources, 

* awareness/knowledge, 

* barriers, and 

* patient–provider relationship. 

Both providers and community members expressed uncertainty about vitamin D but used conflicting strategies to manage uncertainty. 

Awareness of this disconnect might facilitate improved patient–provider communication.
