Vitamin D, a versatile secosteroid hormone, continues to captivate scientific interest due to its multifaceted influence on human health. This comprehensive review, part 1 of a series, provides an up-to-date exploration of the molecular mechanisms governing Vitamin D’s impact on various aspects of health. 

Focusing on its pivotal role in the central nervous system (CNS), neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, the review also delves into its intriguing correslations with oral, prostate, breast, and colon cancers. 

Beyond these domains, Vitamin D’s reach extends to viral infections and reproductive health, affecting fertility in both males and females and playing a crucial role throughout pregnancy. 

The article offers an in-depth examination of the complex molecular pathways and signaling cascades through which Vitamin D exerts its physiological effects. Importantly, it provides a detailed overview of Vitamin D’s involvement in a spectrum of diseases, laying the foundation for the upcoming second part of the article. This forthcoming article (part II) will expand on the role of Vitamin D in additional diseases, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of its therapeutic potential. In summary, this article serves as a valuable resource for researchers and healthcare professionals, offering insights into the diverse roles of Vitamin D and setting the stage for further exploration in part II.
