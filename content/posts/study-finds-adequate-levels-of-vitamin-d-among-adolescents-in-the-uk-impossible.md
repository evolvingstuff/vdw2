### [Study finds adequate levels of vitamin D among adolescents in the UK](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20161018/Study-finds-adequate-levels-of-vitamin-D-among-adolescents-in-the-UK.aspx) News-Medical.Net

 **The very first sentence of the article completely disagrees with the title** 

"A study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, has shown  **high levels of vitamin D inadequacy in UK adolescents** , and - for the first time - identified the intake needed by adolescents in order to maintain adequate serum vitamin D levels during the winter time. "

I often have seen titles which indicated that vitamin D was not needed, but the actual study showed thar more Vitamin D was needed.

This is the first time I can recall that the title so disagreed with the content
