#### A new medical study found that  [Conception May Be Hard for Women With Epilepsy](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/Seizures/22690)

### Seems as simple as adding 1+1

* 1  [Vitamin D deficiency is known to increase with use of anti-epileptic drugs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20508330)

   * 54 items in PubMed with[epilepsy and bone in Title](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)

   * [Antiepileptic drugs and bone health: Dietary calcium and vitamin D the confounding factors](http://www.neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2010;volume=58;issue=2;spage=175;epage=176;aulast=Murthy) -2010

   * a journal item way back in 1979 [Antiepileptic drugs and vitamin D supplementation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17397265)

* 1  [Vitamin D deficiency is known to increase problems of conception](/tags/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-known-to-increase-problems-of-conception.html)

* 1+1 = People* using anti-epileptic drugs will have problems conceiving

### * People = woman AND man BOTH need enough vitamin D
