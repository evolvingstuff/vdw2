Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are essential fatty acids for the human body. Seafood and microalgae are the most important sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Supplementation with 200 mg/day of DHA during pregnancy and breastfeeding has been suggested for women and infants in countries with low seafood consumption. Maternal concentration of DHA and EPA was associated with concentration in cord blood and breast milk.
