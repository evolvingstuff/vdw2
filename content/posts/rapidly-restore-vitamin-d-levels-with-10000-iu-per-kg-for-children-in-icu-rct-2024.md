Loading doses have been used to quickly restore adult Vitamin D levels for almost a century

The loading doses have been given in as little as a single day or spaced out as long as 8 weeks (50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks is extremely common prescription)

Loading doses are typically oral, but somtimes injection or IV are used, such as when the person is unable to swallow
