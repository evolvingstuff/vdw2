Vitamin D deficiency is a global health concern that is estimated to afflict over one billion people globally. The major role of vitamin D is that of a regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism, thus, being essential for proper bone mineralisation. Concomitantly, vitamin D is known to exert numerous extra-skeletal actions. For example, it has become evident that vitamin D has direct anti-proliferative, pro-differentiation and pro-apoptotic actions on cancer cells. Hence, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased cancer risk and worse prognosis in several malignancies. We have recently demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency promotes secondary cancer growth in bone. These findings were partly attributable to an increase in bone remodelling but also through direct effects of vitamin D on cancer cells. To date, very little is known about vitamin D status of patients with bone tumours in general. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess vitamin D status of patients with diverse bone tumours. Moreover, the aim was to elucidate whether or not there is an association between prediagnostic vitamin D status and tumour malignancy in patients with bone tumours.

In a multi-center analysis, 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium levels of 225 patients that presented with various bone tumours between 2017 and 2018 were assessed. Collectively, 76% of all patients had insufficient vitamin D levels with a total mean 25(OH)D level of 21.43 ng/ml (53.58 nmol/L). In particular, 52% (117/225) of patients were identified as vitamin D deficient and further 24% of patients (55/225) were vitamin D insufficient. Notably, patients diagnosed with malignant bone tumours had significantly lower 25(OH)D levels than patients diagnosed with benign bone tumours [Publisher wants $54 for the PDF](19.3%20vs.%2022.75%20ng/ml%20(48.25%20vs.%2056.86%20nmol/L);%20p%20=%200.04).
