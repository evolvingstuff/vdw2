Thirty-one stable BD patients were randomized to receive n-3 PUFAs or placebo for 6 months and intergroup differences in the incidence of the recurrence of bipolar depression were assessed. Differences in depression severity, manic symptoms, and routine biochemical parameters were also assessed.

The recurrence rate of BD is high and ranges from 35 to 57 % within 1 year (Shim et al., 2017), necessitating lifelong medications to prevent the disease recurrence. However, suboptimal compliance with these medications due to concerns about their potential adverse effects and toxicity has been reported (Bates et al., 2010; Malhi, 2015), underscoring the need for better-tolerated alternative medications.</p><p>Evidence suggests the beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in managing mood disorders with high tolerability (Su et al., 2014; Zailani et al., 2023) and may be good alternatives to BD medications. Notably, n-3 PUFAs deficiency, often accompanied by inflammation characterizes BD (Huang et al., 2022; McNamara and Welge, 2016). Interestingly, n-3 PUFAs have proven abilities to protect neurons and modulate inflammatory pathways, which could partly be responsible for their antidepressant effects.</p><p>Findings from previous studies of n-3 PUFAs in BD yielded incoherent results.</p><ul><li><p>While some studies reported favorable effects of n-3 PUFAs in BD (Frangou et al., 2006; Stoll et al., 1999),</p></li><li><p>others reported no benefits (Chiu et al., 2003; Keck et al., 2006; McPhilemy et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2012).</p></li></ul><p>Of note, previous studies of n-3 PUFAs in BD were limited by</p><ul><li><p>a relatively short follow-up period,</p></li><li><p>the use of DHA-predominant formulations, or a</p></li><li><p>lower dose of the n-3 PUFAs.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, this trial aimed to assess the prophylactic effects and tolerability of high-dose n-3 PUFAs in the prevention of relapse of bipolar depression.</p><p><strong><a href="https://examine.com/research-feed/study/dGrn59/?srsltid=AfmBOop3iiT7teNwgdv-af5WYFQnGf0pwp_ikgLrdBuEZJf6qLX5feYP">Examine.com has a summary of the study</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;The fish oil contained a total of 1,680 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 880 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as well as 8 mg of vitamin E.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;This was a pilot study, and the findings should be considered preliminary, especially given the small sample size.

Therefore, this cross-sectional study analyzed 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and the vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR) in BD and correlated the results with clinical affective symptomatology and functionality. The inactive precursor 25(OH)D, and its principal catabolite 24,25(OH)2D, were measured simultaneously with a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method in 170 BD outpatients and 138 healthy controls. VMR was calculated as follows: VMR = 100×(24,25(OH)2D/25(OH)D). The psychometric assessment comprised: Beck Depression Inventory-II, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning, and number of suicide attempts.</p><p><strong>We did not find a significant difference between patients and controls in the concentrations of 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)2D.</strong> Additionally, the VMR was comparable in both groups. The calculations for the clinical parameters showed a negative correlation between the Young Mania Rating Scale and 24,25(OH)2D (r = −0.154, p = 0.040), as well as the Young Mania Rating Scale and the VMR (r = −0.238, p = 0.015).</p><p>Based on the small effect size and the predominantly euthymic sample, further exploration in individuals with manic symptoms would be needed to confirm this association.

It is one of the leading causes of disease-related disability worldwide. Despite the presence of various alternative drug options for bipolar disorder, some patients do not adequately benefit from the treatment. Therefore, possible underlying mechanisms need to be clarified. Recently, studies on the relationship between bipolar disorder and vitamin D (Vit D) have attracted attention. Although many studies have found an association between depression and Vit D deficiency, little is known about the relationship between manic episodes and Vit D. The aim of this study was to compare Vit D and related metabolites of bipolar manic episodes prior to treatment, bipolar remission after treatment, and healthy control groups.</p><p>Methods: This case-control study consisted of 34 bipolar manic episode patients and 34 healthy controls. Disease activity was evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Firstly, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) levels of patients in the bipolar manic episode were measured and compared with healthy control. Secondly, serum 25-OHD, Ca and P levels in the euthymic periods of the same patients were measured and compared with healthy control.</p><p>Results: Bipolar manic episode Vit D levels were lower when compared to healthy controls; while there was no difference in terms of Ca and P levels. There was no significant difference between the bipolar euthymic period patients and the healthy control group in terms of 25-OHD, Ca and P levels.</p><p>Conclusion: Our results demonstrated low serum Vit D concentrations in the acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. Decreased Vit D level may play a role in the onset of the manic episode, or malnutrition and insufficient sunlight during the manic episode may have caused Vit D deficiency. Future studies are needed to exclude potential confounding factors and to compare all mood episodes.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/manic-attacks-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-might-help-bipolar---jan-2021>Vitamin D might help bipolar - Jan 2021</h4><p><strong>The role of vitamin D in bipolar disorder: Epidemiology and influence on disease activity</strong></p><p>Journal of Affective Disorders Vol 278, 1 Jan 2021, Pages 209-217 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.039>FREE PDF</a></p><p>Background</p><p>Although many studies found an association between psychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder, and vitamin D deficiency, little is still known about the association between vitamin D and bipolar disorder (BD).

In the majority of the studies, the average values of vitamin D in BD population were sub-threshold for vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, although an association between vitamin D levels and clinical symptomatology was observed in BD patients, it cannot be considered a specific marker of this disorder but a common characteristic shared with other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. Finally, vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in both depressive and manic symptoms.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>Few studies with small and heterogeneous populations.

Subgroup analysis by sex revealed significant results in both subgroups (P value &lt; 0.0001 and P value = 0.023 for males and females, respectively). Expression of CYP27B1 was up-regulated in cases vs. controls (Posterior beta = 0.415, P &lt; 0.0001). Such pattern was also detected among males (P &lt; 0.0001), but not females (P = 0.419). Similarly, MALAT1 and Linc00346 were up-regulated in total cases vs. controls (Posterior beta = 0.694, P &lt; 0.0001 and Posterior beta = 0.4, P = 0.012, respectively) and in male cases compared with male controls (Posterior beta = 0.712, P &lt; 0.0001 and Posterior beta = 0.41, P value = 0.038, respectively). Expression of VDR was up-regulated in total cases compared with controls (Posterior beta = 0.683, P value = 0.001). Finally, expression of Linc00511 was not different between groups. MALAT1, SNHG6, CYP27B1, VDR and Linc00346 had AUC values of 0.95, 0.94, 0.91, 0.85 and 0.83 in differentiation of male patients from controls, respectively.</p><p>Conclusion: The current study suggests VDR-associated genes as possible markers for BD.</p><hr><h4 id=more-sunlight-and-higher-temperature--more-bipolar-opposite-of-vitamin-d-association---dec-2021>More sunlight and higher temperature ==> more bipolar (opposite of Vitamin D association) - Dec 2021</h4><p><strong>The influence of weather on the course of bipolar disorder: A systematic review</strong></p><p>The European J of Psychiatry Vol 35, Issue 4, Dec 2021, Pages 261-273 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2021.03.002>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2021.03.002</a></p><p>J.M.Montesa C.Serrano b A.Pascual-Sanchez c</p><p>Background and objectives</p><p>Several studies have addressed the relationship between bipolar disorder and meteorological variables, but no previous review focusing on the influence of a wide range of meteorological variables on bipolar disorder has been published. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review about the influence of weather on the clinical course of bipolar disorder patients.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the main electronic medical databases were searched in February 2020, and studies were screened based on the eligibility criteria. 24 studies were selected for qualitative synthesis. Most of them were observational retrospective studies based in medical records.</p><p>Results</p><p>The most studied meteorological variables were temperature and sunlight, and the most studied clinical outcomes were hospital admissions. Significant correlations were found between temperature and sunlight and clinical outcomes, although the findings were heterogeneous. Higher temperatures may trigger bipolar disorder relapses that require hospital admission, and higher expositions to sunlight may increase the risk of manic episodes.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Meteorological variables seem to have an influence in the course of bipolar disorder, especially temperature and sunlight, although further studies are needed to clarify this possible relationship.</p><hr><h4 id=bipolar-review-of-nutraceuticals--no-vitamin-d---sept-2022>Bipolar review of Nutraceuticals (no vitamin D) - Sept 2022</h4><p><strong>A Systematic Review of Nutraceuticals for the Treatment of Bipolar Disorder</strong></p><p><a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743720961734>FREE PDF</a></p><p>Studies revealed promising, albeit conflicting, evidence for omega-3 fatty acids and N-acetylcysteine.

In this study, we assess the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA administration for prophylaxis in BD using a clinical trial design over 52-weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04210804).</p><p>METHODS</p><p>Individuals with BD (n = 80) were randomised to receive placebo (n = 40) or <strong>1 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus 1 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; n = 40)</strong> adjunctively for 52-weeks. The primary outcome measure comprised the number of mood episode relapses including hospital admissions and medication changes experienced. Secondary outcome measures included time to first mood episode relapse and change in psychometric measures of depression and elation (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale).</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>No significant differences in the number of mood episode relapses (U = 490.00, p = 0.14) or the number of individuals requiring admission to hospital (χ2 = 0.67, p = 0.41) or medication adjustment in the omega-3 PUFA compared to the placebo group were noted. Time to relapse was not significantly different between groups (Log Rank χ2 = 0.41, p = 0.52).</p><p>Change in Young Manic Rating Scale (F(3.12, 152.86) = 2.71, p = 0.05) was significantly different between treatment groups over 12-months, with scores at 9-months and 12-months significantly lower than those at 3-months in the omega-3 group and not in the placebo group.</p><p>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Global Clinical Impression and Global Assessment of Functioning were not different between groups.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS</p><p>Despite a minor reduction in hypomania scores in the omega-3 PUFA group compared to placebo, we find little evidence that the supplementation of omega-3-PUFAs exhibits prophylactic benefit in BD.</p><hr><h4 id=less-sun-more-bipolar-disorder---oct-2014>Less sun more Bipolar Disorder - Oct 2014</h4><p><strong>Relationship between sunlight and the age of onset of bipolar disorder: An international multisite study</strong></p><p>Journal of Affective Disorders, Volume 167, 1 October 2014, Pages 104–111</p><p>Background</p><p>The onset of bipolar disorder is influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. We previously found that a large increase in sunlight in springtime was associated with a lower age of onset. This study extends this analysis with more collection sites at diverse locations, and includes family history and polarity of first episode.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Data from 4037 patients with bipolar I disorder were collected at 36 collection sites in 23 countries at latitudes spanning 3.2 north (N) to 63.4 N and 38.2 south (S) of the equator. The age of onset of the first episode, onset location, family history of mood disorders, and polarity of first episode were obtained retrospectively, from patient records and/or direct interview. Solar insolation data were obtained for the onset locations.</p><p>Results: There was a large, significant inverse relationship between maximum monthly increase in solar insolation and age of onset, controlling for the country median age and the birth cohort. The effect was reduced by half if there was no family history. The maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in springtime. The effect was one-third smaller for initial episodes of mania than depression. The largest maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in northern latitudes such as Oslo, Norway, and warm and dry areas such as Los Angeles, California.</p><p>Limitations: Recall bias for onset and family history data.</p><p>Conclusions: A large springtime increase in sunlight may have an important influence on the onset of bipolar disorder, especially in those with a family history of mood disorders.</p><hr><h4 id=nutritional-and-safety-outcomes-from-an-open-label-micronutrient-intervention-for-pediatric-bipolar-spectrum-disordershttponlineliebertpubcomdoiabs101089cap2012009820-oct-2013><a href=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cap.2012.0098%20>Nutritional and Safety Outcomes from an Open-Label Micronutrient Intervention for Pediatric Bipolar Spectrum Disorders</a> Oct 2013</h4><p><strong>Abstract says the study tried some unspecified amount of vitamin D, which did help.</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/bipolar-2013.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=mood-disorders-helped-by-vitamin-d-omega-3-etc--jan-2017>Mood disorders helped by Vitamin D, Omega-3, etc -Jan 2017</h4><p><strong>Clinical use of nutraceuticals in the adjunctive treatment of depression in mood disorders.</strong></p><p>Australas Psychiatry. 2017 Jan 1:1039856216689533. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856216689533.>doi: 10.1177/1039856216689533.</a> <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span></p><p>Sarris J1.
