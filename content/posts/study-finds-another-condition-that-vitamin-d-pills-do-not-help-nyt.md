#### New York Times reporting on NEJM study

 **[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/health/vitamin-d-bone-fractures.html)** 

* "But now, in the first large randomized controlled study in the United States, funded by the federal government, researchers report that vitamin D pills taken  **with or without calcium**  have no effect on bone fracture rates."

##### NO Calcium was used in the trial - yet NYT said otherwise

##### Half of participants had sufficient Vitamin D

##### Many were likely taking 800 IU daily (intervention group also took 2,000 IU)

#### NEJM sub-study of VITAL - July 2022

 **Supplemental Vitamin D and Incident Fractures in Midlife and Older Adults** 

N Engl J Med 2022; 387:299-309 July 28, 2022 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2202106

BACKGROUND

Vitamin D supplements are widely recommended for bone health in the general population, but data on whether they prevent fractures have been inconsistent.

METHODS

In an ancillary study of the  **Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL)** , we tested whether supplemental vitamin D3 would result in a lower risk of fractures than placebo. VITAL was a two-by-two factorial, randomized, controlled trial that investigated whether supplemental  **vitamin D3 (2000 IU per day)** , n−3 fatty acids (1 g per day), or both would prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease in men 50 years of age or older and women 55 years of age or older in the United States.  **Participants were not recruited on the basis of vitamin D deficiency** , low bone mass, or osteoporosis. Incident fractures were reported by participants on annual questionnaires and adjudicated by centralized medical-record review. The primary end points were incident total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. Proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the treatment effect in intention-to-treat analyses.

RESULTS

Among 25,871 participants (50.6% women <span>[13,085 of 25,871]</span> and 20.2% Black <span>[5106 of 25,304]</span>), we confirmed 1991 incident fractures in 1551 participants over a median follow-up of 5.3 years. Supplemental vitamin D3, as compared with placebo, did not have a significant effect on total fractures (which occurred in 769 of 12,927 participants in the vitamin D group and in 782 of 12,944 participants in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.89 to 1.08; P=0.70), nonvertebral fractures (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07; P=0.50), or hip fractures (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.47; P=0.96). There was no modification of the treatment effect according to baseline characteristics, including age, sex, race or ethnic group, body-mass index, or serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. There were no substantial between-group differences in adverse events as assessed in the parent trial.

CONCLUSIONS

Vitamin D3 supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults who were not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis.

#### NEJM Editorial in the same issue

* “Providers should stop screening for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or recommending vitamin D supplements and people should stop taking vitamin D supplements in order to prevent major diseases or extend life,”

* "And Dr. Rosen, who signed off on the National Academy of Medicine report,  **has become a vitamin D therapeutic nihilist** . “I don’t believe any more in 600 units,” he said. “I don’t believe you should do anything.”
