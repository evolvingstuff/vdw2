Magnesium ion plays an important role in maintaining vascular functional integrity.. The Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS), serving as a novel metric for the assessment of magnesium deficiency, has not been thoroughly investigated for its association with stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between the MDS index and stroke in CKD patients.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2016 to explore the impact of MDS on the stroke outcome of CKD patients. The primary outcome was the risk of stroke in CKD patients. Sample-weighted multivariate logistic regression was used in our analysis.</p><p>Results</p><p>In this study of 3,536 CKD patients from the database, we found an 8.6% prevalence of stroke with higher stroke risk in older individuals and males. Lower dietary magnesium intake and higher MDS scores were significantly associated with stroke risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between MDS scores and stroke likelihood, independent of demographic and clinical factors. Subgroup analysis confirmed these findings, particularly in those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, without significant interactions (all p > 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: Magnesium depletion is independently associated with a heightened stroke risk in chronic kidney disease patients.</p><hr><h4 id=magnesium-deficiency-the-silent-killer-linked-to-a-4x-higher-death-rate---june-2024>Magnesium Deficiency: The Silent Killer Linked to a 4x Higher Death Rate - June 2024</h4><p><strong><a href=https://greenmedinfo.com/content/magnesium-deficiency-silent-killer-linked-4x-higher-death-rate>Green Med Info</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;The MDS: Your Magnesium Status Decoder&rdquo;</p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;This is where the Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS) comes in.

We then validated MDS for risk stratification and for associations with inflammation and mortality among >10,000 US adults (weighted: aged 48 ± 0.3 y, 47% men) in the NHANES, a nationally representative study. A proportional hazards regression model was used for associations between magnesium intake and the MDS with risks of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.</p><p>Results: In the PPCCT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for magnesium deficiency was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) for the model incorporating the MDS with sex and age compared with 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.67) for the model with serum magnesium alone. In the NHANES, mean serum C-reactive protein significantly increased with increasing MDS (P-trend &lt; 0.01) after adjusting for age and sex and other covariates, primarily among individuals with magnesium intake less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; P-trend &lt; 0.05). Further, we found that low magnesium intake was longitudinally associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality only among those with magnesium deficiency predicted by MDS. MDS was associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality in a dose-response manner only among those with magnesium intake less than the EAR.</p><p>Conclusions: The MDS serves as a promising measure in identifying individuals with magnesium deficiency who may benefit from increased intake of magnesium to reduce risks of systemic inflammation and CVD mortality.

The weighted multivariate linear regression model was performed to assess the linear relationship between dietary Mg intake and osteoporosis. Further, the non-linear relationship was also characterized by smooth curve fitting (SCF) and weighted generalized additive model (GAM). In addition, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between the MDS and osteoporosis were assessed by weighted logistic regression models.</p><p>Results: After adjusting all covariates, the weighted multivariable linear regression models demonstrated that the dietary Mg intake negatively correlated with osteoporosis, especially in participants aged 55 years or older. In addition, the non-linear relationship characterized by SCF and weighted GAM showed that the dietary Mg intake presented an L-shaped association with osteoporosis among females aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the weighted logistic regression model demonstrated that compared with MDS 0, the OR between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 2.987 (95% CI 1.904, 4.686) in the male-middle intake group. Moreover, compared with MDS 0, the ORs between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 5.666 (95% CI 3.188, 10.069) in the female-low intake group and 1.691 (95% CI 1.394, 2.051) in the female-middle intake group.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study indicated that in people with a daily intake of Mg level below the recommended daily intake (RDI), the dietary Mg intake and Mg bioavailability represented by MDS have a negative correlation with osteoporosis. According to the results, the combination of MDS and dietary Mg intake may be more comprehensive and rigorous in screening the population with osteoporosis. Therefore, early monitoring and interventions for osteoporosis may be necessary for those with insufficient dietary Mg intake or high MDS scores.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mds-osteo-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=mds-and-chronic-kidney-disease---2023>MDS and Chronic Kidney Disease - 2023</h4><p><strong>Magnesium Depletion Score is Associated with Long-Term Mortality in Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Prospective Population-Based Cohort Study</strong></p><p>Journal of Nephrology, Volume 36, pages 755–765, (2023) PDF behind paywall and in <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/magnesium-depletion-score-is-associated-with-long-term-mortality-in-BA4pzq6l0M?key=springer">DeepDyve</a></p><p>Saifu Yin, Zhaoxia Zhou, Tao Lin & Xianding Wang</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mds-ckd.webp alt=image width=800><p>Background</p><p>Magnesium deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) due to restricted magnesium intake and impaired magnesium reabsorption.

The present study intended to explore the association of MDS with mortality among hypertension (HTN) participants. In this cohort study, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2003 to 2018. MDS levels were categorized into three groups (lower: MDS = 0–1; middle: MDS = 2; higher: MDS = 3–5). Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to illustrate survival differences between groups with varying MDS levels. The relationship between MDS and mortality was assessed through weighted multivariate Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses, along with sensitivity analyses, were also conducted to further explore and validate the findings. This study encompassed 12,485 participants, recording 2537 all-cause deaths and 707 cardiovascular deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the higher MDS group had the highest rates of all-cause and cardiovascular death. (P &lt; 0.001). Controlling for all confounding variables, participants belonging to the higher MDS group demonstrated a substantially elevated risk of mortality in comparison to the lower MDS group (all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.54; cardiovascular mortality: HR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.19–2.22). There were no interaction factors found in subgroup analyses that affected the relationship between MDS and mortality, except for cardiovascular disease. The findings were confirmed to be robust through further sensitivity analyses. Higher MDS levels independently predict an elevated risk of mortality among US adults with HTN. Therefore, MDS may serve as a cost-effective and widely available prognostic marker for HTN.</p><hr><h4 id=mds-and-diabetes---jan-2024>MDS and Diabetes - Jan 2024</h4><p><strong>Associations of the magnesium depletion score and magnesium intake with diabetes among US adults: an analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2018</strong></p><p>Epidemiol Health. 2024; 46: e2024020 online 2024 Jan 10. <a href=https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2024020>doi: 10.4178/epih.e2024020</a></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mds-diabetes-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=high-mds-increases-risk-of--congestive-heart-failure-by-32-x---may-2023>High MDS increases risk of Congestive Heart Failure by 3.2 X - May 2023</h4><p><strong>Association of Magnesium Depletion Score with Congestive Heart Failure: Results from the NHANES 2007–2016</strong></p><p>Biological Trace Element Research Volume 202, pages 454–465, (2024) <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journal/association-of-magnesium-depletion-score-with-congestive-heart-failure-Dzlpgs0GSq?key=springer">DeepDyve</a></p><p>Diming Zhao, Pengfei Chen, Mingjian Chen, Liang Chen & Liqing Wang</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mds-chf.webp alt=image width=500><p>The magnesium depletion score (MDS) is considered a new valuable and reliable predictor of body magnesium status.

This research examines both the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between magnesium depletion score (MDS) and erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as all-cause mortality in individuals diagnosed with ED. The analysis utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). To evaluate the correlation between MDS and ED, along with mortality outcomes, weighted multivariate regression and Cox proportional hazards models were employed. Out of the total 3,917 participants, 1,090 were identified as having ED, and 654 individuals succumbed to all-cause mortality.

After controlling for potential confounding variables, it was found that each incremental increase of one point in MDS correlated with a 37% heightened risk of developing ED (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.16–1.62). 

Furthermore, among those with ED, a greater MDS score was linked to a 30% elevation in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.17–1.45). Sensitivity analyses, which included subgroup evaluations and propensity score matching (PSM), validated the robustness of these results. The findings indicate a significant association between MDS and both the prevalence of ED and the risk of all-cause mortality in individuals suffering from ED, highlighting the critical role of magnesium status in the health of men.

#### Low MDS is associated with strokes in people with Chronic Kidney Disease - Aug 2024

 **Association between Magnesium Depletion Score and stroke in US adults with chronic kidney disease: a population-based study** 

Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2024.107963](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2024.107963)

Background

Magnesium ion metabolism disorder is pervasive in the chronic kidney disease population, which is affected by many factors. Magnesium ion plays an important role in maintaining vascular functional integrity.. The Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS), serving as a novel metric for the assessment of magnesium deficiency, has not been thoroughly investigated for its association with stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between the MDS index and stroke in CKD patients.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2016 to explore the impact of MDS on the stroke outcome of CKD patients. The primary outcome was the risk of stroke in CKD patients. Sample-weighted multivariate logistic regression was used in our analysis.

Results

In this study of 3,536 CKD patients from the database, we found an 8.6% prevalence of stroke with higher stroke risk in older individuals and males. Lower dietary magnesium intake and higher MDS scores were significantly associated with stroke risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between MDS scores and stroke likelihood, independent of demographic and clinical factors. Subgroup analysis confirmed these findings, particularly in those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, without significant interactions (all p &gt; 0.05).

Conclusion: Magnesium depletion is independently associated with a heightened stroke risk in chronic kidney disease patients.

Background: Kidney reabsorption of magnesium (Mg) is essential for homeostasis.

Objectives: We developed and validated models with the kidney reabsorption-related magnesium depletion score (MDS) to predict states of magnesium deficiency and disease outcomes.

Methods: MDS was validated in predicting body magnesium status among 77 adults (aged 62 ± 8 y, 51% men) at high risk of magnesium deficiency in the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT) (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01105169) using the magnesium tolerance test (MTT). We then validated MDS for risk stratification and for associations with inflammation and mortality among &gt;10,000 US adults (weighted: aged 48 ± 0.3 y, 47% men) in the NHANES, a nationally representative study. A proportional hazards regression model was used for associations between magnesium intake and the MDS with risks of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.

Results: In the PPCCT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for magnesium deficiency was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) for the model incorporating the MDS with sex and age compared with 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.67) for the model with serum magnesium alone. In the NHANES, mean serum C-reactive protein significantly increased with increasing MDS (P-trend &lt; 0.01) after adjusting for age and sex and other covariates, primarily among individuals with magnesium intake less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; P-trend &lt; 0.05). Further, we found that low magnesium intake was longitudinally associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality only among those with magnesium deficiency predicted by MDS. MDS was associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality in a dose-response manner only among those with magnesium intake less than the EAR.

Conclusions: The MDS serves as a promising measure in identifying individuals with magnesium deficiency who may benefit from increased intake of magnesium to reduce risks of systemic inflammation and CVD mortality. This lays a foundation for precision-based nutritional interventions.

Objectives: The study aimed to explore the associations between dietary magnesium (Mg) intake and magnesium depletion score (MDS) among American adults with osteoporosis.

Methods: The continuous data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2013–2014, and 2017–2018 were merged to ensure a large and representative sample and a total of 14,566 participants were enrolled for the analysis. The weighted multivariate linear regression model was performed to assess the linear relationship between dietary Mg intake and osteoporosis. Further, the non-linear relationship was also characterized by smooth curve fitting (SCF) and weighted generalized additive model (GAM). In addition, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between the MDS and osteoporosis were assessed by weighted logistic regression models.

Results: After adjusting all covariates, the weighted multivariable linear regression models demonstrated that the dietary Mg intake negatively correlated with osteoporosis, especially in participants aged 55 years or older. In addition, the non-linear relationship characterized by SCF and weighted GAM showed that the dietary Mg intake presented an L-shaped association with osteoporosis among females aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the weighted logistic regression model demonstrated that compared with MDS 0, the OR between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 2.987 (95% CI 1.904, 4.686) in the male-middle intake group. Moreover, compared with MDS 0, the ORs between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 5.666 (95% CI 3.188, 10.069) in the female-low intake group and 1.691 (95% CI 1.394, 2.051) in the female-middle intake group.

Conclusion: The present study indicated that in people with a daily intake of Mg level below the recommended daily intake (RDI), the dietary Mg intake and Mg bioavailability represented by MDS have a negative correlation with osteoporosis. According to the results, the combination of MDS and dietary Mg intake may be more comprehensive and rigorous in screening the population with osteoporosis. Therefore, early monitoring and interventions for osteoporosis may be necessary for those with insufficient dietary Mg intake or high MDS scores.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mds-ckd.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;

Background

Magnesium deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) due to restricted magnesium intake and impaired magnesium reabsorption. Based on pathophysiological risk factors influencing kidney magnesium reabsorption, a magnesium depletion score (MDS) was developed. Using MDS as a novel indicator for assessing body magnesium status, we hypothesized that it was associated with clinical prognosis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014 to explore the impact of MDS on the clinical outcomes of CKD patients. Propensity score-matched analyses were conducted to increase comparability. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were cardiovascular-cause and cancer-cause mortality.

Results

After propensity score matching, 3294 CKD patients were divided into 2 groups: MDS ≤ 2 (N = 1647), and MDS &gt; 2 (N = 1647). During a median follow-up of 75 months, Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that MDS &gt; 2 was associated with worse 5- and 10-year overall survival (78.5% vs 73.4%; 53.1% vs 43.1%, P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, MDS was found to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR:1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.50, P &lt; 0.001). MDS &gt; 2 was also associated with higher cardiovascular-cause mortality (16.2% VS 11.6%, P = 0.005). Multivariate competing risk analysis revealed that MDS &gt; 2 was an independent risk factor (HR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.06–1.66, P = 0.012). Subgroup analyses reported that MDS &gt; 2 increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-cause mortality only in patients with inadequate magnesium intake (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) but not in those with adequate intake (P = 0.068, P = 0.920).

Conclusions

A magnesium depletion score &gt; 2 was independently associated with higher long-term cardiovascular-cause and all-cause mortality in CKD patients.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/mds-mets.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;

Context

The association between magnesium status and metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains unclear.

Objective

This study aimed to examine the relationship between kidney reabsorption-related magnesium depletion score (MDS) and MetS among US adults.

Methods

We analyzed data from 15 565 adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 to 2018. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program&#39;s Adult Treatment Panel III report. The MDS is a scoring system developed to predict the status of magnesium deficiency that fully considers the pathophysiological factors influencing the kidneys&#39; reabsorption capability. Weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess the association between MDS and MetS. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to characterize dose-response relationships. Stratified analyses by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were also performed.

Results

In both univariate and multivariable analyses, higher MDS was significantly associated with increased odds of MetS. 

 **Each unit increase in MDS was associated with approximately a 30% higher risk for MetS** , even after adjusting for confounding factors (odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI, 1.17-1.45). RCS graphs depicted a linear dose-response relationship across the MDS range. This positive correlation remained consistent across various population subgroups and exhibited no significant interaction by age, sex, race, adiposity, smoking status, or alcohol consumption.

Conclusion

Higher urinary magnesium loss as quantified by MDS may be an independent linear risk factor for MetS in US adults, irrespective of sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Optimizing magnesium nutritional status could potentially confer benefits to patients with MetS.

#### MDS increases risk of Sleep Apnea by 3X - Aug 2024

 **Association between magnesium deficiency score and sleep quality in adults: A population-based cross-sectional study** 

Journal of Affective Disorders Volume 358, 1 August 2024, Pages 105-112 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.002

Xiaomin Luo, Min Tang, Xiaohui Wei, Yongde Peng

Highlights

* A graded dose-response relationship was found between MDS and sleep trouble/sleep disorder.

* A significant positive association was found between MDS and sleep apnea.

* No association was found between MDS and restless legs, insomnia or insufficient sleep.

* MDS was positively associated with excessive sleep in subjects ≥60 years.

* Adequate magnesium intake may be beneficial in ameliorating this association.

Background

The association between magnesium status and sleep quality is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between renal reabsorption-related magnesium depletion score (MDS) and sleep quality.

Methods

This study was conducted through a cross-sectional survey of adults aged ≥20 years who participated in NHANES 2005–2014. We used weighted logistic regression to examine the association between MDS and sleep quality and performed trend tests to analyze for the presence of a dose-response relationship. Subgroup analyses were performed based on various sleep outcomes and covariates.

Results

A total of 20,585 participants were included in the study, with a mean age of 48.8 years and 50.7 % female. After adjusting for all covariates, we found a graded dose-response relationship between MDS and sleep trouble as well as sleep disorder. Further analyses revealed a significant positive association between  **MDS and sleep apnea (OR = 3.01** ; 95 % CI 1.37–6.62), but no association with restless legs, insomnia or insufficient sleep. In addition, subgroup analyses revealed that middle-aged, male, obese, low magnesium intake, and depressed patients were more prone to sleep trouble and sleep disorder; interestingly, MDS was positively associated with excessive sleep in subjects ≥60 years and without depression.

Conclusions

Our study found a significant association between MDS and sleep quality, particularly sleep apnea, but adequate magnesium intake may be beneficial in mitigating this association. MDS may be associated with excessive sleep in older adults, but not with insufficient sleep or insomnia.

Object(ive)

The association between magnesium depletion score (MDS) and kidney stone disease (KSD) remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the association of MDS with KSD in adults.

Methods

A total of 19,654 participants were enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The MDS was calculated by assessing four aspects, including alcohol assumption, renal function, and use of diuretics and proton pump inhibitor. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations between MDS and the prevalence of KSD. Linear correlations were conducted explore the relationship of testosterone with MDS.

Results

In the multivariable logistic regressions with full adjustment for confounding variables, the odds ratio of MDS associating with KSD was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.04–1.58, P = 0.022) in total population, and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.16–2.50, P=0.007) in female participants. Besides, compared to the lowest MDS, the highest MDS was associated with a lower testosterone (β = −16.39, P=0.009) after full adjustment in non-menopause women.

Conclusion

This study highlighted a positive correlation of high MDS with KSD in female population, which may be associated low level of serum testosterone.

The magnesium depletion score (MDS) emerges as a new valuable predictor of the body’s magnesium status index. This study aims to explore the link between MDS and hypertension (HTN) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. A total of 9708 participants from NHANES (2007–2018) were enrolled to investigate MDS’s connection with HTN. HTN was defined based on clinical guidelines. 

MDS classification (low, 0–1; middle, 2; high, 3–5) relied on alcohol consumption, diuretic use, proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, and kidney disease. Multivariable logistic regression assessed MDS-HTN association. Subsequent analyses included interaction tests, subgroups, and sensitivity analysis. Each unit increase in MDS correlated with an 87% higher HTN risk (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.64–2.13) after adjusting for confounders. 

High MDS participants exhibited significantly elevated HTN risk compared to low MDS counterparts (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 4.81–14.36), with a significant trend across MDS groups (p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses supported a consistent positive correlation. Sensitivity analysis confirmed a robust association. The results indicated a positive correlation between MDS and the risk of developing HTN in US adults.

The magnesium depletion score (MDS) is a novel index utilized for evaluating body magnesium status. The present study intended to explore the association of MDS with mortality among hypertension (HTN) participants. In this cohort study, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2003 to 2018. MDS levels were categorized into three groups (lower: MDS = 0–1; middle: MDS = 2; higher: MDS = 3–5). Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to illustrate survival differences between groups with varying MDS levels. The relationship between MDS and mortality was assessed through weighted multivariate Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses, along with sensitivity analyses, were also conducted to further explore and validate the findings. This study encompassed 12,485 participants, recording 2537 all-cause deaths and 707 cardiovascular deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the higher MDS group had the highest rates of all-cause and cardiovascular death. (P &lt; 0.001). Controlling for all confounding variables, participants belonging to the higher MDS group demonstrated a substantially elevated risk of mortality in comparison to the lower MDS group (all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.54; cardiovascular mortality: HR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.19–2.22). There were no interaction factors found in subgroup analyses that affected the relationship between MDS and mortality, except for cardiovascular disease. The findings were confirmed to be robust through further sensitivity analyses. Higher MDS levels independently predict an elevated risk of mortality among US adults with HTN. Therefore, MDS may serve as a cost-effective and widely available prognostic marker for HTN.

#### High MDS increases risk of  Congestive Heart Failure by 3.2 X - May 2023

 **Association of Magnesium Depletion Score with Congestive Heart Failure: Results from the NHANES 2007–2016** 

Biological Trace Element Research Volume 202, pages 454–465, (2024)  [DeepDyve](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journal/association-of-magnesium-depletion-score-with-congestive-heart-failure-Dzlpgs0GSq?key=springer)

The magnesium depletion score (MDS) is considered a new valuable and reliable predictor of body magnesium status. This study aimed to explore the association between MDS and congestive heart failure (CHF) among US adults. A total of 19,227 eligible participants from the 2007–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were enrolled in this study and then divided into three groups according to the level of MDS (none to low: MDS=0–1, middle: MDS=2, high: MDS=3–5). Sample-weighted logistic regression models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) exploring the independent relationship between MDS and CHF. The estimated prevalence of CHF increased with the increasing level of MDS (none to low: 0.86%, middle: 4.06%, high: 13.52%; P &lt; 0.001). 

Compared to those in the none-to-low group, participants in the middle and high groups were at significantly higher risk of CHF after adjusting for various covariates (model 3: OR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.05–2.30, P &lt; 0.001;  **OR=3.20** , 95%CI: 2.07–4.96, P &lt; 0.001; respectively). Subgroup analyses indicated that adequate dietary magnesium intake could reduce the risk of CHF in participants who did not meet the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium. Besides, there was an interaction between coronary artery disease and MDS on CHF (P for interaction &lt; 0.001). These findings indicated that MDS, a novel indicator estimating magnesium deficiency, is associated with the risk of CHF in non-institutionalized US civilians. Participants whose dietary magnesium intake reaches the RDA might be at lower risk.

We then validated MDS for risk stratification and for associations with inflammation and mortality among &gt;10,000 US adults (weighted: aged 48 ± 0.3 y, 47% men) in the NHANES, a nationally representative study. A proportional hazards regression model was used for associations between magnesium intake and the MDS with risks of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.\n\nResults: In the PPCCT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for magnesium deficiency was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) for the model incorporating the MDS with sex and age compared with 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.67) for the model with serum magnesium alone. In the NHANES, mean serum C-reactive protein significantly increased with increasing MDS (P-trend &lt; 0.01) after adjusting for age and sex and other covariates, primarily among individuals with magnesium intake less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; P-trend &lt; 0.05). Further, we found that low magnesium intake was longitudinally associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality only among those with magnesium deficiency predicted by MDS. MDS was associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality in a dose-response manner only among those with magnesium intake less than the EAR.\n\nConclusions: The MDS serves as a promising measure in identifying individuals with magnesium deficiency who may benefit from increased intake of magnesium to reduce risks of systemic inflammation and CVD mortality. This lays a foundation for precision-based nutritional interventions.\n`

The weighted multivariate linear regression model was performed to assess the linear relationship between dietary Mg intake and osteoporosis. Further, the non-linear relationship was also characterized by smooth curve fitting (SCF) and weighted generalized additive model (GAM). In addition, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between the MDS and osteoporosis were assessed by weighted logistic regression models.\n\nResults: After adjusting all covariates, the weighted multivariable linear regression models demonstrated that the dietary Mg intake negatively correlated with osteoporosis, especially in participants aged 55 years or older. In addition, the non-linear relationship characterized by SCF and weighted GAM showed that the dietary Mg intake presented an L-shaped association with osteoporosis among females aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the weighted logistic regression model demonstrated that compared with MDS 0, the OR between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 2.987 (95% CI 1.904, 4.686) in the male-middle intake group. Moreover, compared with MDS 0, the ORs between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 5.666 (95% CI 3.188, 10.069) in the female-low intake group and 1.691 (95% CI 1.394, 2.051) in the female-middle intake group.\n\nConclusion: The present study indicated that in people with a daily intake of Mg level below the recommended daily intake (RDI), the dietary Mg intake and Mg bioavailability represented by MDS have a negative correlation with osteoporosis. According to the results, the combination of MDS and dietary Mg intake may be more comprehensive and rigorous in screening the population with osteoporosis. Therefore, early monitoring and interventions for osteoporosis may be necessary for those with insufficient dietary Mg intake or high MDS scores.\n`

Based on pathophysiological risk factors influencing kidney magnesium reabsorption, a magnesium depletion score (MDS) was developed. Using MDS as a novel indicator for assessing body magnesium status, we hypothesized that it was associated with clinical prognosis.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a prospective population-based cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014 to explore the impact of MDS on the clinical outcomes of CKD patients. Propensity score-matched analyses were conducted to increase comparability. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were cardiovascular-cause and cancer-cause mortality.\n\nResults\nAfter propensity score matching, 3294 CKD patients were divided into 2 groups: MDS ≤ 2 (N = 1647), and MDS &gt; 2 (N = 1647). During a median follow-up of 75 months, Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that MDS &gt; 2 was associated with worse 5- and 10-year overall survival (78.5% vs 73.4%; 53.1% vs 43.1%, P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, MDS was found to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR:1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.50, P &lt; 0.001). MDS &gt; 2 was also associated with higher cardiovascular-cause mortality (16.2% VS 11.6%, P = 0.005). Multivariate competing risk analysis revealed that MDS &gt; 2 was an independent risk factor (HR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.06–1.66, P = 0.012). Subgroup analyses reported that MDS &gt; 2 increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-cause mortality only in patients with inadequate magnesium intake (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) but not in those with adequate intake (P = 0.068, P = 0.920).\n\nConclusions\nA magnesium depletion score &gt; 2 was independently associated with higher long-term cardiovascular-cause and all-cause mortality in CKD patients.`

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were cardiovascular-cause and cancer-cause mortality.\n\nResults\nAfter propensity score matching, 3294 CKD patients were divided into 2 groups: MDS ≤ 2 (N = 1647), and MDS &gt; 2 (N = 1647). During a median follow-up of 75 months, Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that MDS &gt; 2 was associated with worse 5- and 10-year overall survival (78.5% vs 73.4%; 53.1% vs 43.1%, P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, MDS was found to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR:1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.50, P &lt; 0.001). MDS &gt; 2 was also associated with higher cardiovascular-cause mortality (16.2% VS 11.6%, P = 0.005). Multivariate competing risk analysis revealed that MDS &gt; 2 was an independent risk factor (HR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.06–1.66, P = 0.012). Subgroup analyses reported that MDS &gt; 2 increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-cause mortality only in patients with inadequate magnesium intake (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) but not in those with adequate intake (P = 0.068, P = 0.920).\n\nConclusions\nA magnesium depletion score &gt; 2 was independently associated with higher long-term cardiovascular-cause and all-cause mortality in CKD patients.`├── HorizontalRuleNode

This study aims to explore the link between MDS and hypertension (HTN) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. A total of 9708 participants from NHANES (2007–2018) were enrolled to investigate MDS’s connection with HTN. HTN was defined based on clinical guidelines. \nMDS classification (low, 0–1; middle, 2; high, 3–5) relied on alcohol consumption, diuretic use, proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, and kidney disease. Multivariable logistic regression assessed MDS-HTN association. Subsequent analyses included interaction tests, subgroups, and sensitivity analysis. Each unit increase in MDS correlated with an 87% higher HTN risk (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.64–2.13) after adjusting for confounders. \nHigh MDS participants exhibited significantly elevated HTN risk compared to low MDS counterparts (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 4.81–14.36), with a significant trend across MDS groups (p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses supported a consistent positive correlation. Sensitivity analysis confirmed a robust association.

This study aims to explore the link between MDS and hypertension (HTN) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. A total of 9708 participants from NHANES (2007–2018) were enrolled to investigate MDS’s connection with HTN. HTN was defined based on clinical guidelines. \nMDS classification (low, 0–1; middle, 2; high, 3–5) relied on alcohol consumption, diuretic use, proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, and kidney disease. Multivariable logistic regression assessed MDS-HTN association. Subsequent analyses included interaction tests, subgroups, and sensitivity analysis. Each unit increase in MDS correlated with an 87% higher HTN risk (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.64–2.13) after adjusting for confounders. \nHigh MDS participants exhibited significantly elevated HTN risk compared to low MDS counterparts (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 4.81–14.36), with a significant trend across MDS groups (p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses supported a consistent positive correlation. Sensitivity analysis confirmed a robust association. The results indicated a positive correlation between MDS and the risk of developing HTN in US adults.`├── HorizontalRuleNode

The present study intended to explore the association of MDS with mortality among hypertension (HTN) participants. In this cohort study, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2003 to 2018. MDS levels were categorized into three groups (lower: MDS = 0–1; middle: MDS = 2; higher: MDS = 3–5). Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to illustrate survival differences between groups with varying MDS levels. The relationship between MDS and mortality was assessed through weighted multivariate Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses, along with sensitivity analyses, were also conducted to further explore and validate the findings. This study encompassed 12,485 participants, recording 2537 all-cause deaths and 707 cardiovascular deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the higher MDS group had the highest rates of all-cause and cardiovascular death. (P &lt; 0.001). Controlling for all confounding variables, participants belonging to the higher MDS group demonstrated a substantially elevated risk of mortality in comparison to the lower MDS group (all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.54; cardiovascular mortality: HR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.19–2.22). There were no interaction factors found in subgroup analyses that affected the relationship between MDS and mortality, except for cardiovascular disease. The findings were confirmed to be robust through further sensitivity analyses. Higher MDS levels independently predict an elevated risk of mortality among US adults with HTN. Therefore, MDS may serve as a cost-effective and widely available prognostic marker for HTN.`

This research examines both the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between magnesium depletion score (MDS) and erectile dysfunction (ED), as well as all-cause mortality in individuals diagnosed with ED. The analysis utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). To evaluate the correlation between MDS and ED, along with mortality outcomes, weighted multivariate regression and Cox proportional hazards models were employed. Out of the total 3,917 participants, 1,090 were identified as having ED, and 654 individuals succumbed to all-cause mortality.
After controlling for potential confounding variables, it was found that each incremental increase of one point in MDS correlated with a 37% heightened risk of developing ED (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.16–1.62). 
Furthermore, among those with ED, a greater MDS score was linked to a 30% elevation in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.17–1.45). Sensitivity analyses, which included subgroup evaluations and propensity score matching (PSM), validated the robustness of these results. The findings indicate a significant association between MDS and both the prevalence of ED and the risk of all-cause mortality in individuals suffering from ED, highlighting the critical role of magnesium status in the health of men.

!!!!Low MDS is associated with strokes in people with Chronic Kidney Disease - Aug 2024
__Association between Magnesium Depletion Score and stroke in US adults with chronic kidney disease: a population-based study__
Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2024.107963]

Background
Magnesium ion metabolism disorder is pervasive in the chronic kidney disease population, which is affected by many factors. Magnesium ion plays an important role in maintaining vascular functional integrity.. The Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS), serving as a novel metric for the assessment of magnesium deficiency, has not been thoroughly investigated for its association with stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between the MDS index and stroke in CKD patients.

Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2016 to explore the impact of MDS on the stroke outcome of CKD patients. The primary outcome was the risk of stroke in CKD patients. Sample-weighted multivariate logistic regression was used in our analysis.

Results
In this study of 3,536 CKD patients from the database, we found an 8.6% prevalence of stroke with higher stroke risk in older individuals and males. Lower dietary magnesium intake and higher MDS scores were significantly associated with stroke risk. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a dose-dependent relationship between MDS scores and stroke likelihood, independent of demographic and clinical factors. Subgroup analysis confirmed these findings, particularly in those with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, without significant interactions (all p &gt; 0.05).

Conclusion: Magnesium depletion is independently associated with a heightened stroke risk in chronic kidney disease patients.

Background: Kidney reabsorption of magnesium (Mg) is essential for homeostasis.

Objectives: We developed and validated models with the kidney reabsorption-related magnesium depletion score (MDS) to predict states of magnesium deficiency and disease outcomes.

Methods: MDS was validated in predicting body magnesium status among 77 adults (aged 62 ± 8 y, 51% men) at high risk of magnesium deficiency in the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal Cancer Trial (PPCCT) (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01105169) using the magnesium tolerance test (MTT). We then validated MDS for risk stratification and for associations with inflammation and mortality among &gt;10,000 US adults (weighted: aged 48 ± 0.3 y, 47% men) in the NHANES, a nationally representative study. A proportional hazards regression model was used for associations between magnesium intake and the MDS with risks of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.

Results: In the PPCCT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for magnesium deficiency was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) for the model incorporating the MDS with sex and age compared with 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.67) for the model with serum magnesium alone. In the NHANES, mean serum C-reactive protein significantly increased with increasing MDS (P-trend &lt; 0.01) after adjusting for age and sex and other covariates, primarily among individuals with magnesium intake less than the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR; P-trend &lt; 0.05). Further, we found that low magnesium intake was longitudinally associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality only among those with magnesium deficiency predicted by MDS. MDS was associated with increased risks of total and CVD mortality in a dose-response manner only among those with magnesium intake less than the EAR.

Conclusions: The MDS serves as a promising measure in identifying individuals with magnesium deficiency who may benefit from increased intake of magnesium to reduce risks of systemic inflammation and CVD mortality. This lays a foundation for precision-based nutritional interventions.

Objectives: The study aimed to explore the associations between dietary magnesium (Mg) intake and magnesium depletion score (MDS) among American adults with osteoporosis.

Methods: The continuous data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010, 2013–2014, and 2017–2018 were merged to ensure a large and representative sample and a total of 14,566 participants were enrolled for the analysis. The weighted multivariate linear regression model was performed to assess the linear relationship between dietary Mg intake and osteoporosis. Further, the non-linear relationship was also characterized by smooth curve fitting (SCF) and weighted generalized additive model (GAM). In addition, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between the MDS and osteoporosis were assessed by weighted logistic regression models.

Results: After adjusting all covariates, the weighted multivariable linear regression models demonstrated that the dietary Mg intake negatively correlated with osteoporosis, especially in participants aged 55 years or older. In addition, the non-linear relationship characterized by SCF and weighted GAM showed that the dietary Mg intake presented an L-shaped association with osteoporosis among females aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the weighted logistic regression model demonstrated that compared with MDS 0, the OR between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 2.987 (95% CI 1.904, 4.686) in the male-middle intake group. Moreover, compared with MDS 0, the ORs between MDS ≥3 and osteoporosis was 5.666 (95% CI 3.188, 10.069) in the female-low intake group and 1.691 (95% CI 1.394, 2.051) in the female-middle intake group.

Conclusion: The present study indicated that in people with a daily intake of Mg level below the recommended daily intake (RDI), the dietary Mg intake and Mg bioavailability represented by MDS have a negative correlation with osteoporosis. According to the results, the combination of MDS and dietary Mg intake may be more comprehensive and rigorous in screening the population with osteoporosis. Therefore, early monitoring and interventions for osteoporosis may be necessary for those with insufficient dietary Mg intake or high MDS scores.

!!!!MDS and Chronic Kidney Disease - 2023
__Magnesium Depletion Score is Associated with Long-Term Mortality in Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Prospective Population-Based Cohort Study__
Journal of Nephrology, Volume 36, pages 755–765, (2023) PDF behind paywall and in [https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/magnesium-depletion-score-is-associated-with-long-term-mortality-in-BA4pzq6l0M?key=springer|DeepDyve]

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21270&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;}
Background
Magnesium deficiency is common in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) due to restricted magnesium intake and impaired magnesium reabsorption. Based on pathophysiological risk factors influencing kidney magnesium reabsorption, a magnesium depletion score (MDS) was developed. Using MDS as a novel indicator for assessing body magnesium status, we hypothesized that it was associated with clinical prognosis.

Methods
We conducted a prospective population-based cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014 to explore the impact of MDS on the clinical outcomes of CKD patients. Propensity score-matched analyses were conducted to increase comparability. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were cardiovascular-cause and cancer-cause mortality.

Results
After propensity score matching, 3294 CKD patients were divided into 2 groups: MDS ≤ 2 (N = 1647), and MDS &gt; 2 (N = 1647). During a median follow-up of 75 months, Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that MDS &gt; 2 was associated with worse 5- and 10-year overall survival (78.5% vs 73.4%; 53.1% vs 43.1%, P &lt; 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, MDS was found to be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR:1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.50, P &lt; 0.001). MDS &gt; 2 was also associated with higher cardiovascular-cause mortality (16.2% VS 11.6%, P = 0.005). Multivariate competing risk analysis revealed that MDS &gt; 2 was an independent risk factor (HR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.06–1.66, P = 0.012). Subgroup analyses reported that MDS &gt; 2 increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-cause mortality only in patients with inadequate magnesium intake (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001) but not in those with adequate intake (P = 0.068, P = 0.920).

Conclusions
A magnesium depletion score &gt; 2 was independently associated with higher long-term cardiovascular-cause and all-cause mortality in CKD patients.

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21272&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;}
Context
The association between magnesium status and metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains unclear.

Objective
This study aimed to examine the relationship between kidney reabsorption-related magnesium depletion score (MDS) and MetS among US adults.

Methods
We analyzed data from 15 565 adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003 to 2018. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program&#39;s Adult Treatment Panel III report. The MDS is a scoring system developed to predict the status of magnesium deficiency that fully considers the pathophysiological factors influencing the kidneys&#39; reabsorption capability. Weighted univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to assess the association between MDS and MetS. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to characterize dose-response relationships. Stratified analyses by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors were also performed.

Results
In both univariate and multivariable analyses, higher MDS was significantly associated with increased odds of MetS. 
__Each unit increase in MDS was associated with approximately a 30% higher risk for MetS__, even after adjusting for confounding factors (odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI, 1.17-1.45). RCS graphs depicted a linear dose-response relationship across the MDS range. This positive correlation remained consistent across various population subgroups and exhibited no significant interaction by age, sex, race, adiposity, smoking status, or alcohol consumption.

Conclusion
Higher urinary magnesium loss as quantified by MDS may be an independent linear risk factor for MetS in US adults, irrespective of sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Optimizing magnesium nutritional status could potentially confer benefits to patients with MetS.

Xiaomin Luo, Min Tang, Xiaohui Wei, Yongde Peng

Highlights
*A graded dose-response relationship was found between MDS and sleep trouble/sleep disorder.
*A significant positive association was found between MDS and sleep apnea.
*No association was found between MDS and restless legs, insomnia or insufficient sleep.
*MDS was positively associated with excessive sleep in subjects ≥60 years.
*Adequate magnesium intake may be beneficial in ameliorating this association.
Background
The association between magnesium status and sleep quality is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between renal reabsorption-related magnesium depletion score (MDS) and sleep quality.

Methods
This study was conducted through a cross-sectional survey of adults aged ≥20 years who participated in NHANES 2005–2014. We used weighted logistic regression to examine the association between MDS and sleep quality and performed trend tests to analyze for the presence of a dose-response relationship. Subgroup analyses were performed based on various sleep outcomes and covariates.

Results
A total of 20,585 participants were included in the study, with a mean age of 48.8 years and 50.7 % female. After adjusting for all covariates, we found a graded dose-response relationship between MDS and sleep trouble as well as sleep disorder. Further analyses revealed a significant positive association between __MDS and sleep apnea (OR = 3.01__; 95 % CI 1.37–6.62), but no association with restless legs, insomnia or insufficient sleep. In addition, subgroup analyses revealed that middle-aged, male, obese, low magnesium intake, and depressed patients were more prone to sleep trouble and sleep disorder; interestingly, MDS was positively associated with excessive sleep in subjects ≥60 years and without depression.

Conclusions
Our study found a significant association between MDS and sleep quality, particularly sleep apnea, but adequate magnesium intake may be beneficial in mitigating this association. MDS may be associated with excessive sleep in older adults, but not with insufficient sleep or insomnia.

Object(ive)
The association between magnesium depletion score (MDS) and kidney stone disease (KSD) remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the association of MDS with KSD in adults.

Methods
A total of 19,654 participants were enrolled from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The MDS was calculated by assessing four aspects, including alcohol assumption, renal function, and use of diuretics and proton pump inhibitor. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations between MDS and the prevalence of KSD. Linear correlations were conducted explore the relationship of testosterone with MDS.

Results
In the multivariable logistic regressions with full adjustment for confounding variables, the odds ratio of MDS associating with KSD was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.04–1.58, P = 0.022) in total population, and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.16–2.50, P=0.007) in female participants. Besides, compared to the lowest MDS, the highest MDS was associated with a lower testosterone (β = −16.39, P=0.009) after full adjustment in non-menopause women.

Conclusion
This study highlighted a positive correlation of high MDS with KSD in female population, which may be associated low level of serum testosterone.

The magnesium depletion score (MDS) emerges as a new valuable predictor of the body’s magnesium status index. This study aims to explore the link between MDS and hypertension (HTN) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. A total of 9708 participants from NHANES (2007–2018) were enrolled to investigate MDS’s connection with HTN. HTN was defined based on clinical guidelines. 
MDS classification (low, 0–1; middle, 2; high, 3–5) relied on alcohol consumption, diuretic use, proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, and kidney disease. Multivariable logistic regression assessed MDS-HTN association. Subsequent analyses included interaction tests, subgroups, and sensitivity analysis. Each unit increase in MDS correlated with an 87% higher HTN risk (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.64–2.13) after adjusting for confounders. 
High MDS participants exhibited significantly elevated HTN risk compared to low MDS counterparts (OR, 8.31; 95% CI, 4.81–14.36), with a significant trend across MDS groups (p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses supported a consistent positive correlation. Sensitivity analysis confirmed a robust association. The results indicated a positive correlation between MDS and the risk of developing HTN in US adults.

The magnesium depletion score (MDS) is a novel index utilized for evaluating body magnesium status. The present study intended to explore the association of MDS with mortality among hypertension (HTN) participants. In this cohort study, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2003 to 2018. MDS levels were categorized into three groups (lower: MDS = 0–1; middle: MDS = 2; higher: MDS = 3–5). Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to illustrate survival differences between groups with varying MDS levels. The relationship between MDS and mortality was assessed through weighted multivariate Cox regression models. Subgroup analyses, along with sensitivity analyses, were also conducted to further explore and validate the findings. This study encompassed 12,485 participants, recording 2537 all-cause deaths and 707 cardiovascular deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the higher MDS group had the highest rates of all-cause and cardiovascular death. (P &lt; 0.001). Controlling for all confounding variables, participants belonging to the higher MDS group demonstrated a substantially elevated risk of mortality in comparison to the lower MDS group (all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.54; cardiovascular mortality: HR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.19–2.22). There were no interaction factors found in subgroup analyses that affected the relationship between MDS and mortality, except for cardiovascular disease. The findings were confirmed to be robust through further sensitivity analyses. Higher MDS levels independently predict an elevated risk of mortality among US adults with HTN. Therefore, MDS may serve as a cost-effective and widely available prognostic marker for HTN.

The magnesium depletion score (MDS) is considered a new valuable and reliable predictor of body magnesium status. This study aimed to explore the association between MDS and congestive heart failure (CHF) among US adults. A total of 19,227 eligible participants from the 2007–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were enrolled in this study and then divided into three groups according to the level of MDS (none to low: MDS=0–1, middle: MDS=2, high: MDS=3–5). Sample-weighted logistic regression models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) exploring the independent relationship between MDS and CHF. The estimated prevalence of CHF increased with the increasing level of MDS (none to low: 0.86%, middle: 4.06%, high: 13.52%; P &lt; 0.001). 
Compared to those in the none-to-low group, participants in the middle and high groups were at significantly higher risk of CHF after adjusting for various covariates (model 3: OR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.05–2.30, P &lt; 0.001; __OR=3.20__, 95%CI: 2.07–4.96, P &lt; 0.001; respectively). Subgroup analyses indicated that adequate dietary magnesium intake could reduce the risk of CHF in participants who did not meet the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium. Besides, there was an interaction between coronary artery disease and MDS on CHF (P for interaction &lt; 0.001). These findings indicated that MDS, a novel indicator estimating magnesium deficiency, is associated with the risk of CHF in non-institutionalized US civilians. Participants whose dietary magnesium intake reaches the RDA might be at lower risk.
