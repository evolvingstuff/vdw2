 **Update: [Vitamin D reduces COVID-19 by 80 percent - anonymous meta-analysis - Jan 5, 2021](/posts/vitamin-d-reduces-covid-19-by-80-percent-anonymous-meta-analysis)** 

 **Snapshot as of Dec 15. 2020** 

 **Treatment↓80%**  42 Vitamin D studies. 33 peer reviewed

89% of studies report positive effects. 

80% is the median improvement.

 **Sufficiency ↓53%** 96% of studies report positive effects

Sufficiency (levels) studies analyze outcomes for vitamin D levels. 

Confounding factors may be significant.

I have asked who is the owner of the excellent data analysis
