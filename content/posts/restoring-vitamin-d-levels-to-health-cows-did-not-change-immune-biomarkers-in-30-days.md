 **The study** 

1. Deprived cows of Vitamin D for 4 months

1. Supplemented healthy cows with Vitamin D in 5 ways for just 1 month

1. Found no differences in immune markers at 1 month

 **What this study does not indicate** 

* How many cows were not healthy after 4 months of no Vitamin D and did not participate

* If unhealthy cows might have benefited from Vitamin D in 1 or more months

* If the healthy cows in this study had any improvement at more than 1 month

   * The vitamin D levels appeared to still be increasing at 1 month
