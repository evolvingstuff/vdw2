#### [Monitoring the vitamin D package measure](https://english.zorginstituutnederland.nl/publications/reports/2023/12/01/monitoring-the-vitamin-d-package-measure)

* "...discontinue the reimbursement of all vitamin D products containing cholecalciferol or calcifediol from 1 January 2023"

 **People belong to this vulnerable group if they have at least 1 of these characteristics.   
This was selected because people often have more than 1 issue.** 

people with difficulty keeping oversight of their medicines;

people with osteoporosis;

people with a language barrier or an immigration background;

people with a low level of education;

people with low socio-economic status;

people with generally ill health;

people with limited health literacy;

people with low-level literacy.

 **Study results: most people continued taking vitamin D  
The study shows that a large proportion of vulnerable people have continued to take vitamin D:** 

* 65% continued to use vitamin D and now pay for it themselves. The main reason is that people consider vitamin D necessary for their health. 

* 5% stopped taking vitamin D. Half of them say they stopped because they cannot afford it. 

* 20% still had a supply of vitamin D and continued to use it. Of this group, 

> 

* 70% say they will continue taking vitamin D when they run out of supply. 

   * 6 to 7% say they will stop.

* The remaining 10% did not enter any useful information.

* The study also shows that patient compliance in vulnerable vitamin D users is not optimal in 2023: some people take less vitamin D than they should. However, that was already the case in 2022, meaning that patient compliance has not changed as a result of the package measure. 

 **Patient compliance is not optimal** 

" **Almost half of the people using it forget to take it and part of them consciously takes it differently.** 

 **Half of the stoppers indicate they cannot afford the product** 

About 5% of the vulnerable group report that they have stopped taking vitamin D, half of them because they cannot afford it.

• If this is extrapolated to the Dutch situation, it affects about 25,000 vulnerable people who are forgoing vitamin D because of the costs (available over the counter from less than 10 euros per person per year).

 **Note by VitaminDWiki: 50,000 IU pill every two weeks would cost <5 euros/person/year   
AND there would be 13 fewer occasions to forget to take it**
