#### Passive smoking while pregnant increased Atopic Dermatitis Risk in Children by 52% - March 2024

 **Maternal tobacco exposure during pregnancy and atopic dermatitis in offspring: A systematic review and meta-analysis**

First published: 14 March 2024 https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.19958

The main purpose of this review was to examine the evidence of the relationship between active smoking or passive smoking during pregnancy and atopic dermatitis in offspring. The protocol was written following the PRISMA Checklist and was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42022381136). We implemented a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases to identify all potentially related articles from inception through 1 December 2022. We assessed cohort studies and case–control studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies. Heterogeneity was investigated by using Cochrane Q tests and I2 statistics. In addition, according to the research design, population source and population size, the reasons for the heterogeneity were analysed. A total of 15 observational studies were included in this analysis. 

Our meta-analysis suggests that atopic dermatitis in offspring is not associated with active smoking during pregnancy (pooled OR, 0.96 <span>[95% CI 0.86–1.07]</span>); however,  **it is related to passive smoking (OR, 1.52 <span>[95% CI 1.36–1.70]</span>).**  Passive smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of eczema development in offspring. More research is needed to explore the risk of active smoking and eczema development in offspring, especially the association between measurements of pregnancy cotinine levels in maternal body fluids and AD in offspring.

The main purpose of this review was to examine the evidence of the relationship between active smoking or passive smoking during pregnancy and atopic dermatitis in offspring. The protocol was written following the PRISMA Checklist and was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42022381136). We implemented a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases to identify all potentially related articles from inception through 1 December 2022. We assessed cohort studies and case–control studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies. Heterogeneity was investigated by using Cochrane Q tests and I2 statistics. In addition, according to the research design, population source and population size, the reasons for the heterogeneity were analysed. A total of 15 observational studies were included in this analysis. 
Our meta-analysis suggests that atopic dermatitis in offspring is not associated with active smoking during pregnancy (pooled OR, 0.96 [95% CI 0.86–1.07]); however, __it is related to passive smoking (OR, 1.52 [95% CI 1.36–1.70]).__ Passive smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of eczema development in offspring. More research is needed to explore the risk of active smoking and eczema development in offspring, especially the association between measurements of pregnancy cotinine levels in maternal body fluids and AD in offspring.
