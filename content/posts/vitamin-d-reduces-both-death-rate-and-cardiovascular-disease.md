# New roles for vitamin D

The importance of vitamin D in maintaining bone health is well established. However, it has recently been suggested that vitamin D might reduce total mortality and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. This article critically evaluates the evidence for this suggestion and 

concludes that while there is some experimental support for the suggested effects on  **total mortality, cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer** , the suggested effects on  **type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer lack serious experimental support.** 

Nevertheless, since many cells have the capacity to produce biologically active vitamin D and respond to it through vitamin D receptors then new roles of vitamin D are likely to emerge in the near future. In the meantime, studies specifically designed to investigate effects of vitamin D on these chronic diseases are needed rather than relying on the results of studies designed for other purposes.
