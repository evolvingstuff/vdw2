We aimed to assess the possible relationship between vitamin D deficiency and gross motor developmental milestones in Iranian children in Tehran City, Iran.

MATERIALS & METHODS:

In this cross-sectional study, 186 healthy children of one-yr-old age referring to a children hospital in Tehran, Iran from May 2015 to April 2016, were enrolled. The gross motor developmental milestone of children and their serum vitamin D concentration were evaluated.

RESULTS:

Overall, 186 children, 92 males (49.5%) were studied. Twenty-four patients (12.9%) just were able to sit without support, and 40 patients (21.5%) to stand alone and to sit without support. Besides, 122 patients (65.6%) were able to walk with assistant or alone and to sit without support and stand alone. Vitamin D was sufficient in 148 children (79.6%), insufficient in 32 (17.2%) and deficient in 6 (3.2%).  **Sufficient vitamin D was significantly correlated with walking ability (P<0.001, OR=3.9, 95%CI=1.9-8.4).** 

CONCLUSION:

Considering the significant correlation between vitamin D deficiency and gross motor developmental milestones in this population of children, children referring to gross motor developmental delay need to be thoroughly evaluated for vitamin D deficiency.
