# Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency - available products

from http://www.mstrust.org.uk/news/article.jsp?id=4331

16 November 2010

There are currently a number of supply issues surrounding vitamin D preparations, with the limited number of licensed preparations available being confined to high strength injections for treatment of adult deficiency and oral vitamin drops for paediatric insufficiency.

A recent BMJ article highlighted the problem of vitamin D insufficiency in the UK population. The article cites a survey in which more than 50% of the adult population had insufficiency and 16% had severe insufficiency, and goes on to discuss a large body of observational evidence associating such insufficiency with an increased risk of mortality. The authors report that expert consensus suggests vitamin D status measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) should be 75 nmol/L (30 ?g/L) or more, with deficiency represented by 25-OHD<25 nmol/L and insufficiency represented by 25-OHD of 25-50 nmol/L. We are aware that organisations have or are developing their own local guidance on vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency.

There are currently a number of supply issues surrounding vitamin D preparations, with the limited number of licensed preparations available being confined to high strength injections for treatment of adult deficiency and oral vitamin drops for paediatric insufficiency. Licensed products should be used where available; however, unlicensed or special products may be suitable following a proper consideration of potentially increased risks associated with such medicines as well as what may be substantial costs.

This document outlines the various available treatment options for the range of uses described in the BMJ article. It covers licensed preparations, products available from specialist importers, special manufactured products, and products available as nutritional supplements. Vitamin D calciferol preparations included in this document include those available in 2 forms: colecalciferol and ergocalciferol. It is our understanding that in general colecalciferol is the preferred form, with an oral dose of 20,000 units once weekly prescribed most commonly.

This document was produced with information available from importers and manufacturers as at October 2010. Whilst every effort was made to identify relevant products available, we cannot be certain that each and every potentially useful presentation is listed here. The document does not seek to promote the use of products without marketing authorisation in anyway, but rather simply outlines our understanding of current availability.

The document will be updated every 2-3 months and we welcome comment both on its specific content and overall usefulness.
