Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has been frequently associated with vitamin D deficiency as well as chronic inflammatory response. We tested the hypothesis of an independent relationship between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) in a cohort of HIV-positive people. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 316 HIV-positive people (181 men and 135 women) aged 16 to 60 years residing in the Kathmandu Valley,  **Nepal** . Serum high-sensitivity CRP concentrations and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured by the latex agglutination nephelometry method and the competitive protein-binding assay, respectively. The relationship between serum CRP concentrations and 25(OH)D serum level were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment of potential cardiovascular and HIV-related factors. The proportion of participants with 25(OH)D serum level of <20ng/mL, 20-30ng/mL, and >30ng/mL were 83.2%, 15.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. The mean 25(OH)D serum level in men and women were 15.3ng/mL and 14.4ng/mL, respectively. 

Participants with 25(OH)D serum level of <20ng/mL had a 3.2-fold higher odds of high CRP (>3 mg/L) compared to those with 25(OH)D serum level of >20ng/mL (p=0.005). Men and women with 25(OH)D serum level of <20ng/mL had 3.2 and 2.7-fold higher odds of high CRP (>3 mg/L), respectively, compared to those with 25(OH)D serum level of >20ng/mL. The relationships remained significant only in men (p=0.02) but not in women (p=0.27). A risk of having high level of inflammation (CRP >3 mg/L) may be high among HIV-positive men and women with 25(OH)D serum level of <20 ng/mL.
