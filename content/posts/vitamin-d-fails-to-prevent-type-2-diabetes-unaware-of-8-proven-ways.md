#### [Vitamin D fails to prevent type 2 diabetes in large study](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-diabetes-vitamin-d-idUSKCN1T82AS)

 **[The actual study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1900906)**  $40 million

 **Note: Diabetes and pre-diabetes are associated with poor guts** 

 **Since the start of this trial ([2013](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01942694)) there have been many proven ways to deal with the restrictions of a poor gut** 

1) Use the same total amount of Vitamin D, but less frequently - the higher gradient gets thru better

2) Use more vitamin D daily

3) Use a probiotic to deal with the gut problem

4) Use a gut-friendly form of Vitamin D - there are more than a dozen types

5) Increase the response to Vitamin D by using Omega-3 and/or Magnesium

 **Avoid the poor gut** 

6) Use an injection 

7) Use UV or sun

8) Use topical Vitamin D

 **The current failed trial was probably unaware of any of the above proven solutions** 

4,000 IU orally daily, no probiotic, no Magnesium, no Omega-3

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Note: The pre-diabetic subgroup which started with < 12 ng of Vitamin D were 62% less likely to get diabetes</span>**
