#### FDA Approves 2 New Diabetes Drugs for Kids — Critic Says Clinical Trial Sample Was ‘Shockingly Low’

 **[The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/fda-new-drugs-type-2-diabetes-kids/?utm_source=luminate&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=defender&utm_id=20230623)** 

* "The drugs — Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Synjardy (empagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride) — previously were approved for adults with Type 2 diabetes to improve blood sugar control."

* "But critics like pediatrician Dr. Elizabeth Mumper said the agency’s action  **ignores the root causes of Type 2 diabetes in children while generating profits for pharmaceutical companies** :"

* "“The sample size for this clinical trial is shockingly low. Given that 157 patients were split into three separate treatment groups, it was impossible to properly assess adverse events from the drug."

   * __~ about 53 children per group

   *  **Probably have to take the drug daily for life** 

* "“I would expect that the trial be  **at least 10 times larger**  with a longer period of follow-up than 26 weeks, given that these children would be on the drug indefinitely.”"
