#### Real world evidence of calcifediol or vitamin D prescription and mortality rate of COVID-19 in a retrospective cohort of hospitalized Andalusian patients

Sci Rep. 2021 Dec 3;11(1):23380. [doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-02701-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-02701-5)

COVID-19 is a major worldwide health problem because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Several lines of evidence have suggested a relationship between the vitamin D endocrine system and severity of COVID-19. We present a survival study on a retrospective cohort of  **15,968 patients** , comprising all COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Andalusia between  **January and November 2020** . Based on a central registry of electronic health records (the Andalusian Population Health Database, BPS), prescription of vitamin D or its metabolites within 15-30 days before hospitalization were recorded. The effect of prescription of vitamin D (metabolites) for other indication previous to the hospitalization was studied with respect to patient survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and hazard ratios support an association between prescription of these metabolites and patient survival. Such association was stronger for 

* calcifediol (Hazard Ratio, HR = 0.67, with 95% confidence interval, CI, of <span>[0.50-0.91]</span>) than for 

* cholecalciferol (HR = 0.75, with 95% CI of <span>[0.61-0.91]</span>),

when prescribed 15 days prior hospitalization. 

Although the relation is maintained, there is a general decrease of this effect when a longer period of 30 days prior hospitalization is considered (calcifediol HR = 0.73, with 95% CI <span>[0.57-0.95]</span> and cholecalciferol HR = 0.88, with 95% CI <span>[0.75, 1.03]</span>), suggesting that association was stronger when the prescription was closer to the hospitalization.

#### Observation by VitaminDWiki

Apparently this region in Spain prescribed either 256 mcg  of calcifediol or 25,000 IU of vitamin D 

These appear to be once a month doses

It appears that only those with <20 of vitainm D are given these prescroptions

Many other studies have found both to fight COVID - via prevention or tratment

Suspect that these are not new prescrptions, but rather just the day a new pill was given (have sent a question to one of the authors)

#### Amazon (US) now sells calcifediol

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/amazon.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

~2 months supply of calcifediol costs $20

Vs 2 months supply of Vitamin D (50,000 IU)  costs ~ 20 cents  **(100 X lower cost)**
