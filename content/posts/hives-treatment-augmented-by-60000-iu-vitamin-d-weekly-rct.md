 **Comment** 

The supplementation dose size did not vary with the vitamin D deficiency

Expect far better improvement if larger doses were used for those who were deficient

Also expect far better improvment if loading dose were used or if trial were longer

BACKGROUND:

Several studies suggest that Vitamin D (Vit-D3) supplementation reduces Chronic Urticaria (CU) symptoms.

OBJECTIVES:

Evaluation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25 (OH)2D) level and assessment of therapeutic effect of VitD3in CU patients.

METHODS:

192 subjects were stratified according to the baseline 25(OH)2D levels and subsequently randomized into three subgroups to receive Vit-D3 alone (VD) or antihistamine and systemic corticosteroid (H+S) or VitD3 with antihistamine and systemic corticosteroid (VD+H+S) for 6 weeks between July 2012 to Oct 2014. 130 healthy controls (HC) were followed without any intervention. The patients were evaluated for reduction in urticarial symptoms using visual analogue scale (VAS) and 5-D itch score.

RESULTS:

Low serum levels of 25 (OH)2D was observed in 91% of CU patients and 64% of the healthy controls (P < 0.0001). VAS and 5-D Score in subgroups VD, H + S and VD + H + S decreased significantly from 6 • 7 ± 0 • 043, 6 • 6 ± 0 • 42 and 6 • 68 ± 0 • 40 at baseline to 5 • 2 ± 0 • 70 (P = 0 • 0088), 3 • 3 ± 0 • 50 (P < 0 • 0001) and1 • 86 ± 0 • 39 (P < 0 • 0001) after treatment and from 14 • 5 ± 0 • 72, 13 • 9 ± 0 • 77 and 13 • 9 ± 0 • 221 to 12 • 06 ± 1 • 10 (P = 0 • 0072), 8 • 1 ± 1 • 13 (P < 0 • 0001) and 5 • 01 ± 0 • 94 (P < 0 • 0001) respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:

CU patients have low serum 25(OH)2D levels and Vit-D3 supplementation in combination with antihistamine and systemic corticosteroid show elevated response in resolving the symptoms of CU. This study also warrants that each subject with CU should be screened for serum 25 (OH)2D levels before starting a treatment.
