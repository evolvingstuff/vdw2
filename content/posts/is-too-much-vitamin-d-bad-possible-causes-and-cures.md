**It is well known that TOO LITTLE vitamin D is associated with health problems** 

 **TOO MUCH vitamin D may also be associated with health problems** 

#### Possible reasons include:

1.  **Body is out of balance with too much vitamin D – consider adjusting <a href="/posts/low-cost-cofactors-for-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Low cost cofactors for vitamin D">cofactors</a>** 

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>**  Increase <a href="/posts/overview-vitamin-k-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Vitamin K and Vitamin D">Vitamin K2</a>

> - prevents excess Calcium created by lots of vitamin D from going to wrong places in body (arteries, [prostate](/posts/hypothesis-vitamin-k-will-reduce-prostate-blood-vessel-problems), etc)

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>**  Increase <a href="/posts/overview-magnesium-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Magnesium and vitamin D">Magnesium</a>– which is vital for health but is consumed by Vitamin D

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>**  Reduce <a href="/posts/calcium-hazards-and-bioavailability" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Calcium hazards and bioavailability">Calcium</a> – which may be in excess due to high level of vitamin D

1. Large doses of vitamin D taken very infrequently (quarterly, yearly) is known to cause imbalance and problems

1. The body might change the [Vitamin D Binding Protein](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=143&deep=off&type=) so as to increase vitamin D levels when sick

1. Sick people had attempted to heal themselves by adding Vitamin D or visiting a sunny climate

1. Result of excess <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-needs-some-vitamin-a-but-not-too-much" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Vitamin D needs some vitamin A, but not too much">Vitamin A</a> reducing the benefits of Vitamin D in the blood

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>**  Don't get your Vitamin D from cod liver oil - which appears to have too much Vitamin A

1. Drug dosage often assumes low Vitamin D, High vitamin D increases/decreases <a href="/posts/see-also-some-drugs-change-potency-when-vitamin-d-is-increased-increase-in-a-hormone" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: See also: ((Some drugs change potency when Vitamin D is increased (increase in a hormone)">dose potency</a>

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>**  Have doctors adjust prescribed dosage when a patient is taking lots of vitamin D

1. Some [Drugs Deplete Magnesium](/posts/drugs-deplete-magnesium)

> People may increase their vitamin D levels too high so as to feel benefits even with Magnesium limitation

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>** Take Magnesium

1. Had been taking <a href="/posts/overview-vitamin-d3-not-d2" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Vitamin D3 not D2">Vitamin D2</a> - which is known to cause problems

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>** mTake Vitamin D3 instead of D2

1. J-Shaped does not acutally exist - it was due to old style of Vitamin D tests having too high of readings

>  **<span style="color:#06F;">CURE:</span>**  Do noit take statins or take more vitamin D

#### No increase of mortality with high vitamin D levels (j-shaped) when tests are standardized – April 2017

 **The Reverse J-Shaped Association Between Serum Total 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration and All-Cause Mortality: The Impact of Assay Standardization.** 

Am J Epidemiol. 2017 Apr 15;185(8):720-726. [doi: 10.1093/aje/kww244.](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kww244.)

Durazo-Arvizu RA, Dawson-Hughes B, Kramer H, Cao G, Merkel J, Coates PM, Sempos CT.

We evaluated the impact of standardizing the originally measured serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) values from Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) on the association between 25(OH)D and rate of all-cause mortality. Values were standardized to the gold-standard laboratory method. Follow-up from 1990-2006 consisted of 15,099 participants aged at least 20 years at baseline, among whom there were 3,784 deaths. Relative risk of death was adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and season using Poisson regression.

Results were obtained for eight 25(OH)D (nmol/L) categories: <20 nmol/L, 20-29 nmol/L, 30-39 nmol/L, 40-49 nmol/L, 50-59 nmol/L, 60-74 nmol/L, 75-99 nmol/L (reference), and ≥100 nmol/L.  **Assay standardization dramatically shifted original 25(OH)D values toward zero** . Accordingly, risk ≥120 nmol/L could not be evaluated (i.e., n = 7 and ndeaths = 2). Relative risk (95% confidence interval (CI)) <40 nmol/L remained significant (30-39 nmol/L: relative risk (RR) = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.6); 20-29 nmol/L: RR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3, 1.9), and <20 nmol/L: RR = 2.1 (95% CI: 1.6, 2.7).

However, adjusted relative risk estimates for 25(OH)D levels ≥40 nmol/L were no longer significant (40-49 nmol/L: RR = 1.2 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.4); 50-59 nmol/L: RR = 1.2 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.4); 60-74 nmol/L: RR = 1.1 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.2); 75-99 nmol/L: RR = 1.0 (referent), and ≥100 nmol/L: RR = 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6, 2.1).

In summary, after standardization, risk of death from all causes increased with decreasing 25(OH)D <40 nmol/L, while there was no association with values in categories between 40 nmol/L and 120 nmol/L.
