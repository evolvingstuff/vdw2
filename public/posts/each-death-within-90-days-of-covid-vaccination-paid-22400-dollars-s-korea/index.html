#### South Korea: Government to compensate for all post Covid-19 vaccination deaths within 90 days of the jab, regardless of proof of causality

 **[Trial Site News 1](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/south-korea-government-to-compensate-for-all-post-covid-19-vaccination-deaths-within-90-days-of-the-jab-regardless-of-proof-of-causality-b3cb92ed) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [Trial Site News 2](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/south-korea-assumes-responsibility-for-covid-vax-deaths-by-expanding-compensation-and-eligibility-requirements-876f4a33)** 

&lt;img src=&quot;/attachments/d3.mock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;

 **Some questions in #1** 

1.  Does it make sense to have a compensation system, from the tax-payer to the tax-payer, for harms caused by a product produced by a profit making private entity?

1.  Is financial compensation a just response to post-vaccination adverse events if proper informed consent was never disseminated, and people were misinformed, misled or even coerced to get jabbed?

1.  What about justice for the un-jabbed who chose not to expose themselves to known &amp; possibly unknown adverse effects of a novel medical product, and were unfairly discriminated against as a &quot;consequence&quot; of this &quot;choice&quot;?

1.  Given the massive Covid-19 waves post mass administration of vaccines, and thousands who&#39;ve been compensated for vaccine injury, has there been a tremendous toll on life, limb &amp; tax payer&#39;s money? What would&#39;ve the impact been in the absence of any vaccination campaign?

!!!!South Korea: Government to compensate for all post Covid-19 vaccination deaths within 90 days of the jab, regardless of proof of causality
__[https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/south-korea-government-to-compensate-for-all-post-covid-19-vaccination-deaths-within-90-days-of-the-jab-regardless-of-proof-of-causality-b3cb92ed|Trial Site News 1] ~hs~~hs~ [https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/south-korea-assumes-responsibility-for-covid-vax-deaths-by-expanding-compensation-and-eligibility-requirements-876f4a33|Trial Site News 2]__

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;20090&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;}
__Some questions in #1__
# Does it make sense to have a compensation system, from the tax-payer to the tax-payer, for harms caused by a product produced by a profit making private entity?
# Is financial compensation a just response to post-vaccination adverse events if proper informed consent was never disseminated, and people were misinformed, misled or even coerced to get jabbed?
# What about justice for the un-jabbed who chose not to expose themselves to known &amp; possibly unknown adverse effects of a novel medical product, and were unfairly discriminated against as a &quot;consequence&quot; of this &quot;choice&quot;?
# Given the massive Covid-19 waves post mass administration of vaccines, and thousands who&#39;ve been compensated for vaccine injury, has there been a tremendous toll on life, limb &amp; tax payer&#39;s money? What would&#39;ve the impact been in the absence of any vaccination campaign?
