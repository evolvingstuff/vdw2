Received 26 March 2010; accepted 10 May 2010. 

I have suggested that the primary environmental trigger for autism   is   not   vaccinations,   toxins   or   infections,   but gestational and early childhood vitamin D deficiency (1,2). Subsequently,  the  title  of  an  article  in  Scientific  American recently asked, ‘What if vitamin D deficiency is a cause of autism?’ (3) Since then, an article on vitamin D and autism in Acta Paediatrica (4) and the accompanying commentary (5) have added to the accelerating suspicion that vitamin D deficiency   either  during  pregnancy  or  early  childhood  may be an environmental trigger for the genetic disease of autism.

I  will  not  repeat  the  evidence  from  my  original  2007 paper and I am well aware that evidence consistent with a theory is not proof of that theory. Instead, I concentrate on papers  either  published  since  my  paper,  or  on  evidence  I overlooked  when  researching  the  original  paper.  Finally,  I explain  my  reasons  why  this  theory  deserves  immediate attempts to disprove it.

Simultaneous with the above two Acta Paediatrica publications,  a  paper  elsewhere  reported  that  among  117  adult psychiatric  outpatients  is  Sweden  with  various  diagnoses, the 10 patients with autism had the lowest vitamin D levels of any of the groups studied, a mean of 12 ng ? mL (31 nM), approaching  the  osteomalacic  range  for  adults  and  the rachitic range for children (6). Even more interesting, some of  the  patients  seemed  to  improve  when  treated  with  an average  dose  of  about  4000 IU   of  vitamin  D ? day.  The authors did not say if the improvement occurred in the autism group.

A 2008 review detailed the devastating effect gestational vitamin D deficiency has on developing mammalian brains (7). Unfortunately, the tiny 10 lg (400 IU) dose in prenatal vitamins is virtually irrelevant in preventing the current epidemic of gestational vitamin D deficiency (8). For this reason,  in  2007,  the  Canadian  Paediatric  Society  cautioned pregnant  women  they  may  require  not  400 IU ? day  but 2000 IU ? day,  or  more,  to  prevent  gestational  vitamin  D deficiency (9).

If  adequate  amounts  of  vitamin  D  prevent  autism,  one would expect children with rickets to have an increased risk of  autism.  To  my  knowledge,  the  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  of  rickets  have  not  been  studied  in  the  modern  era. However, at least two old papers have addressed it (10,11), both  published  before  Kanner  described  autism  in  1943. Both  papers  describe  ‘weak  mindedness,’  ‘feeble  minds,’ ‘mental   dullness,’   unresponsiveness   and   developmental delays.  Even  more  intriguing,  both  papers  report  that  the mental condition in rickets improved with vitamin D.

Another   of   the   mysteries   of   autism   is   the   apparent increased incidence of autism in the children of richer college-educated    parents,    especially    women,    a    finding announced  a  few  months  ago  (12).  Actually,  this  is  not  a new  finding.  As  I  discussed  in  my  original  paper,  this  has been  known  since  the  early  1980s  but  was  dismissed  as being because of ascertainment bias. This very recent report correlates well with a 2007 CDC report (13), which found a similar  increased  risk  for  the  wealthy  and  well-educated, findings  the  authors  tried  but  could  not  dismiss  as  being because  of  ascertainment  bias.  If  the  vitamin  D  theory  is true,  autism  should  be  more  common  in  richer  well-educated mothers, who are more likely than other mothers to practice sun avoidance and use sunblock (1,2).

In  his  invited  commentary,  Dr.  Eyles  asked,  ‘Does  skin colour modify the risk’ of autism, noting melanin in the skin is  an  effective  sunblock.  Such  studies  are  difficult  as  they raise  sensitive  social  issues.  Nevertheless,  three  of  four recent  U.S.  studies  found  a  higher  incidence  of  autism  in black   children,   sometimes   appreciably   higher   (1,2).   As Fernell et al. report, the Somali immigrants in Sweden call autism the ‘Swedish disease’ and Somali immigrants in Minnesota  call  it   the  ‘American  disease,’   but   in  equatorial Somalia, autism has no name.

Toxins delivered by water or air pollution appear to damage the genome of the vitamin D deficient (14). If exposure to  such  toxins  were  the  main  contributors  to  autism  incidence, then we should have seen an autism incidence pattern in the US that mirrored air and water pollution with a dramatic increase in the 1950s, a peak in the 1960s and then a  progressive  decline  by  the  early  1980s,  coincident  with enactment and enforcement of the US clean air and clean water acts of the 1960s.

Another possibility is that air pollution from Eastern Europe, India and China, which has been increasing in the last 20 years, has engendered the current crop of autism. However,  why  would  foreign  air  pollution  of  today  do  what American air pollution of the 1950s and 60s could not?

Another  paper  published  after  my  original  paper  found that autistic boys have unexplained reductions in metacarpal  bone  thickness  (15).  At  some  time  in  their  life,  these children laid down less cortical bone than normal children, a  finding  consistent  with  undetected  and  untreated  childhood or even intrauterine vitamin D deficiency.

Yet another recent paper reported that the prevalence of autism  in  three  U.S.  states  was  higher  in  areas  of  higher precipitation and clouds (16). The 2005 autism prevalence rate  among  school-aged  children,  after  controlling  for  differences  in  population  size,  demographic  characteristics, per  capita  income  and  state,  was  higher  in  cloudy  areas. The association of autism prevalence and the mean annual precipitation received by a county between 1987 and 2001 was  positive  and  significant  (p = 0.0034;  95%  confidence interval,  0.0018–0.0050).  Clouds  and  rain  retard  vitamin D-producing ultraviolet B light from penetrating the atmosphere.

Surprisingly, high maternal seafood consumption, of the type  known  to  be  contaminated  with  mercury,  has  been associated with fewer not more autistic markers in the offspring (17). Lower maternal seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with low verbal intelligence quotient, suboptimum outcomes for prosocial behaviour, fine motor, communication  and  social  development  scores.  While  the omega-3  and  mercury  content  of  fish  is  well  known,  less well known is the fact that fish is one of the few foods with significant  amounts  of  vitamin  D,  which,  as  referenced earlier, protects the genome from damage by toxins.

While  the  urban ? rural  gradient  in  rickets  is  well  known and  was  one  of  the  keys  to  discovering  that  sunlight  prevented rickets, less well known is a meta-analysis showing a twofold  urban ? rural  gradient  for  autism  (18).  Similar  to rickets, city life affords less vitamin D, because of tall buildings, indoor occupations and increased urban air pollution, all  of  which  block  ultraviolet  B  light  from  penetrating  the atmosphere.

Finally, a 2008 paper reported that autism was more common  among  mothers  who  took  antiepileptic  drugs  (19).  A comment to the authors (20) detailed the evidence that antiepileptic drugs are one of the few classes of drugs that consistently    and    significantly    interfere    with    vitamin    D metabolism, lowering 25(OH)D levels.

I agree with Dr Eyles’ comment that the vitamin D theory   is   ‘highly   parsimonious.’   Indeed,   it   was   love   of parsimony that led me to first hypothesize that vitamin D is intimately  involved  in  the  pathology  and  epidemiology  of both autism and influenza (21). Some have speculated that the   excess   of   winter   births   in   autism   is   explained   by wintertime  maternal  viral  infections.  Obviously,  another, and  more  parsimonious  explanation,  is  that  vitamin  D  is involved in all three.

The vitamin D theory of autism does not diminish genetic contributions  to  autism  occurrence.  Indeed,  without  the genetic tendency for autism, I suspect that severe maternal or  early  childhood  vitamin  D  deficiency  may  cause  bone abnormalities,  as  referenced  above,  with  no  evidence  autism.  All  that  the  current  epidemic  of  maternal  and  early childhood vitamin D deficiency does, with its resultant neural deficiency in the pluripotent neurosteroid calcitriol, is to allow the genetic tendency for autism to express itself.

If  this  theory  is  true,  the  path  towards  effective  prevention   and  perhaps  a  treatment  effect  if  adequate  physiological doses of vitamin D are given is so simple, so safe, so  inexpensive,  so  readily  available  and  so  easy,  that  it defies  imagination.  Seventeen  vitamin  D  experts  recently stated, ‘In our opinion, children with chronic illnesses such as  autism,  diabetes  and ? or  frequent  infections  should  be supplemented  with  higher  doses  of  sunshine  or  vitamin D3,  doses  adequate  to  maintain  their  25(OH)D  levels  in the    mid-normal    of    the    reference    range    (65 ng ? mL (162 nmol ? L))    and   should   be   so   supplemented   year round.’ (22)

Finally,  if  true,  a  darker  side  of  the  theory  emerges.  To some real but unknown extent, autism is an iatrogenic disease,  caused  by  governments,  organizations,  committees, newspapers  and  physicians  who  promulgated  the  current warnings   about   sun-exposure   for   pregnant   women   and young  children  without  any  understanding  of  the  tragedy they engendered.
