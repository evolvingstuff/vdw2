"Among these are prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and Parkinson’s disease. At the same time, other studies have shown a link between low levels of Vitamin D  and many types of cancers including cancer of the prostate and pancreas. Additionally, recent research suggests that there may be a link between low levels of Vitamin D and Parkinson’s disease."

"The United States Department of Veterans Affairs currently lists prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia as being presumed to be caused by exposure to Agent Orange if the veteran had service in and around Vietnam . Additionally, in late August 2010, the Veterans Administration recently added B cell leukemias, Parkinson’s disease and ischemic heart disease among the presumptive diseases caused by exposure to Agent Orange."
