#### Implication of calcium supplementations in health and diseases with special focus on colorectal cancer

Calcium is a fundamental and integrative element and helps to ensure optimal health by regulating various physiological and pathological processes. While there is substantiated evidence confirming the beneficial effects of calcium in the treatment, management, and prevention of various health conditions, including cancer, conflicting studies are imperative to acknowledge the potential negative role of calcium supplementation. 

The studies on calcium supplementation showed that a specific dose can help in the maintenance of good human health, and in the control of different types of diseases, including cancer. 

Calcium alone and when combined with vitamin D, emerges as a promising therapeutic option for  **efficiently managing cancer growth, when used with chemotherapy** . 

Combination therapy is considered a more effective approach for treating advanced types of colorectal cancer. 

Nevertheless, several challenges drastically influence the treatment of cancer, such as 

* individual discrepancy, 

* drug resistance, and 

* stage of cancer, among others. 

Henceforth, novel preventive, reliable therapeutic modalities are essential to control and reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis, metabolism, and regulation of oncogenesis. Numerous studies have underscored the potential of CaSR, a G protein-coupled receptor, as a potential biomarker and target for colorectal cancer prevention and treatment. The multifaceted involvement of CaSR in anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic processes paves the way for its utilization in the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer. The current review highlights the important role of supplemental calcium in overall health and disease, along with the exploration of intricate mechanisms of CaSR pathways in the management and prevention of colorectal cancer.
