Objective: We aimed to evaluate the vitamin D status, the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation, and the factors associated with vitamin D restoration in nondialytic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Design: The present study was a prospective open-label trial.

Setting: This study took place at the Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center.

Subjects: Patients with nondialytic CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <span>[eGFR]</span> 10-59 mL/min per 1.73 m2) participated in this study.

Intervention: Vitamin D status in 210 CKD patients was assessed and the patients with vitamin D deficiency (<30 ng/mL) were administered cholecalciferol  **(1,000 IU/day)**  for 6 months.

Main Outcome Measure: The restoration rate of vitamin D deficiency at 3 and 6 months and the response-related factors were analyzed.

Results: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 

* 40.7% in CKD Stage 3, 

* 61.5% in Stage 4, and 

* 85.7% in Stage 5. 

The subgroup with vitamin D deficiency had a greater proportion of patients with diabetes, lower eGFR, and higher proteinuria. 

With the supplementation, 52 patients (76.5%) reached levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) of 30 ng/mL or greater at 3 months, and the restoration of vitamin D was observed in 61 patients  **(89.7%) at 6 months** . Lower levels of 25(OH)D and a higher amount of proteinuria at baseline were the factors associated with lower response to vitamin D supplementation.

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency rate was high in nondialytic CKD patients, and the proportion increased as renal function decreased. A higher amount of proteinuria was the independent risk factor of nonresponse with supplementation. Vitamin D was replenished in most patients with cholecalciferol supplementation without any significant adverse effects.
