And is extremely important,</p></li><li><p>3:20 time for development, and for the functions of the nervous system (same thing in the nervous system of an adult).</p></li><li><p>3:30 These skills are not available on medical books</p></li><li><p>3:34 and most doctors are not aware of the importance of this hormone,</p></li><li><p>3:40 that is not a vitamin, is a hormone</p></li><li><p>3:42 which induces the formation of regenerative substances of the nervous system.</p></li><li><p>3:47 And we have begun, for this reason</p></li><li><p>3:50 to administer vitamin D to people who had neurodegenerative diseases</p></li><li><p>3:56 and we did not care to patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s</p></li><li><p>4:03 and we started to make vitamin D in <strong>doses physiologically realistic.</strong></p></li><li><p>4:10 It is important to say that the daily dose is recommended today that, internationally,</p></li><li><p>4:20 does not exclude any patient from vitamin D deficiency,</p></li><li><p>4:27 is a negligible dose, well below the physiological dose.</p></li><li><p>4:32 And then, when we started to give the <strong>physiologic dose, which is the dose of 10,000 units per day,</strong></p></li><li><p>4:39 <strong>ie the dose that is produced with a few minutes of exposure to the sun, namely,</strong></p></li><li><p>4:44 if you&rsquo;re wearing an undershirt and shorts, his legs and arms exposed to the sun,</p></li><li><p>4:53 will produce in 20 minutes, if you have light skin and if you are young, 10,000 units of vitamin D per day.</p></li><li><p>5:04 Then, 10,000 is a physiologic dose, is not a super dose.</p></li><li><p>5:08 However, most doctors consider this potentially toxic dose.</p></li><li><p>5:16 And these doctors today say that the recommended dose is 600 International Units.</p></li><li><p>5:32 So, the recommended 600 IU,</p></li><li><p>5:34 but if a person is exposed to the sun for 20 minutes, producing 10,000 units!</p></li><li><p>5:43 Then, there is an obvious difference between the medical practice and scientific knowledge.</p></li><li><p>5:51 Then, we begin to give 10,000 people with neurodegenerative diseases,</p></li><li><p>5:57 and I remember a patient with Parkinson&rsquo;s, which received 10,000 of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>6:05 when he returned for the second visit, after 3 months (taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D per day)</p></li><li><p>6:13 had a lesion of vitiligo on the face</p></li><li><p>6:19 had declined so much that in a few months of administration of 10,000 IU.</p></li><li><p>6:32 This led us to search for information in the medical literature</p></li><li><p>6:37 in relation to the effects of vitamin D in the immune system.</p></li><li><p>6:41 We were surprised by the huge amount of publications that were already available in 2001-2002.</p></li><li><p>6:57 Based on this first result, we have begun to 10,000 units of vitamin D to patients</p></li><li><p>7:04 with multiple sclerosis, which is the most common autoimmune disease in neurology</p></li><li><p>7:11 and the one that has the most devastating effects of neurological patients.</p></li><li><p>7:17 We were surprised to see how these patients are improved.</p></li><li><p>7:23 And this was the starting point, in attributing a high value on vitamin D</p></li><li><p>7:35 in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>7:37 Today we are absolutely convinced, along with the scientific community that deals</p></li><li><p>7:48 Research on vitamin D, which studies the effects of vitamin D in the immune system:</p></li><li><p>7:54 Vitamin D is the major regulator of the immune system</p></li><li><p>8:03 and modifies the operation of approximately <strong>4,500 genes</strong></p></li><li><p>8:12 in every cell of the immune system. It is a substance without equal.</p></li><li><p>8:21 I do a comparison</p></li><li><p>8:23 to explain what I mean with 4,500 genes that are regulated in their activity by vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>8:36 Imagine a skyscraper where there are many commercial cinemas. Imagine that</p></li><li><p>8:45 4,500 doors in this building can be opened or closed by a unique key.</p></li><li><p>8:55 Then you have to compare the skyscraper with each of the cells of the immune system</p></li><li><p>9:02 and the key is vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>9:05 When you lack vitamin D, the patient fails to regulate, ie open or close,</p></li><li><p>9:13 stimulate or reduce the activity of 4,500 biological functions within the cells of the immune system.</p></li><li><p>9:23 <strong>The lack of this substance is a disaster for the immune system!</strong></p></li><li><p>9:37 The elements that make up the treatment, in reality are summed into a single element, which is vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>9:48 People who have autoimmune diseases, according to what has been published in the scientific literature</p></li><li><p>9:58 inherent in this argument, these people have a partial resistance to the effects of vitamin D;</p></li><li><p>10:08 and this is genetically inherited from the father, mother or both.</p></li><li><p>10:15 This resistance concerns the effects of immuno-modulators of vitamin D, and is a resistance partial and not complete.</p></li><li><p>10:24 And this is the reason for which these people are subject to developing autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>10:31 Then the great element, perhaps the only (maybe the others are responsible for 5% of the results)</p></li><li><p>10:42 but 95% of the results that we have obtained in the <strong>control of autoimmune diseases,</strong></p></li><li><p>10:48 in particular in the control of multiple sclerosis, the effects are due, at <strong>95%, to vitamin D.</strong></p></li><li><p>11:03 And we need to give very high doses of vitamin D to get complete control of the disease.</p></li><li><p>11:12 <strong>These doses are not equal for all patients,</strong> are specific for each patient</p></li><li><p>11:24 and are adjusted according to the degree of resistance that every person with an autoimmune disease</p></li><li><p>11:33 has for vitamin D (to the degree of resistance that possesses in relation to the effects of vitamin D).</p></li><li><p>11:41 What we have done is to develop a method to adjust the daily dose for each individual patient,</p></li><li><p>11:51 and it is done through laboratory tests.</p></li><li><p>11:55 You collect laboratory tests before treatment,</p></li><li><p>12:00 after which damage of the doses already established vitamin D; and after at least 2 months,</p></li><li><p>12:09 which is the time required to increase and stabilize the level of vitamin D in the blood of patients.</p></li><li><p>12:19 After 2 months refer these tests and comparing the results obtained before and after treatment.</p></li><li><p>12:31 Through this comparison, we can adjust the individual dose for a given patient.</p></li><li><p>12:38 And after two months we adjusted, we get</p></li><li><p>12:44 the full effect, which means, in practice, to obtain the status of a suppression of activity of the disease.</p></li><li><p>12:55 The disease remains suppressed after 2 months after dose adjustment.</p></li><li><p>13:09 Therefore, we are currently working with 5 doctors who help us here at the clinic. <strong>Personally, I have already visited about 1,300 patients.</strong></p></li><li><p>13:28 In the clinic, counting the doctors working with us for about 1 year, 1 year and a half, a <strong>total of 2,500 patients</strong> were visited</p></li><li><p>13:42 and we are also training doctors working abroad.</p></li><li><p>13:49 There is one in Argentina, which already works with our protocol, as well as in various cities of Brazil.</p></li><li><p>13:58 These doctors are visiting hundreds of patients each.</p></li><li><p>14:04 So I can tell you that we here at the clinic approximately <strong>2,500 holders of multiple sclerosis,</strong></p></li><li><p>14:14 we&rsquo;re just talking about this disease. If we speak also of other autoimmune diseases, certainly</p></li><li><p>14:25 we have moved to 3000 patients, but speaking only of multiple sclerosis, are 2,500 patients.</p></li><li><p>14:34 This number may still be much greater,</p></li><li><p>14:36 considered that do not charge those patients who were visited</p></li><li><p>14:40 10 or 12 doctors working in other capitals of Brazil</p></li><li><p>14:46 after the treatment here.</p></li><li><p>14:48 Everyone must have visited more than a hundred patients,</p></li><li><p>14:55 then surely this number has reached thousands of patients seen</p></li><li><p>15:00 and also we are receiving patients from abroad in various countries.</p></li><li><p>15:05 This is a phenomenon of the Internet, nowadays, people create groups</p></li><li><p>15:12 and this in a sense is good, because patients come into contact with each other,</p></li><li><p>15:23 to share experiences they have had with the different treatments.</p></li><li><p>15:31 And this has created a phenomenon propro of our day.</p></li><li><p>15:34 Today, the vast majority of patients we look after having had access to the internet.</p></li><li><p>15:43 We have a patient that you have also interviewed, his name is Daniel Cunha, who was a journalist</p></li><li><p>15:50 who has reached the turning point (&ldquo;high&rdquo;) in our clinic, is a former bearer of multiple sclerosis, this is an important thing that you say.</p></li><li><p>15:59 Because after that we can adjust to treatment, ie, the dose of the patient</p></li><li><p>16:05 and prove that in two consecutive spaced resonances of 1 year, ie, separated by 1-year interval,</p></li><li><p>16:18 there has been no appearance of new lesions, recent lesions can disappear, but there is no activity in the lesion,</p></li><li><p>16:29 then when we are able to prove this and the patient has improved,</p></li><li><p>16:36 if he did not damage the oldest, back to having a normal life,</p></li><li><p>16:41 at the end of the two years of treatment, during which we do 3 or 4 visits,</p></li><li><p>16:55 at the end of this period of two years of treatment, the patient reaches the &ldquo;turning point&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>16:59 you have to keep the dose of vitamin D with the necessary precautions to avoid causing intoxication,</p></li><li><p>17:09 but you have to keep the dose of vitamin D and recommend that the patient come back two years later for a re-evaluation,</p></li><li><p>17:15 Then, after five years for a new revaluation.</p></li><li><p>17:19 <strong>We do not know yet how long the patient needs to maintain this high dose of vitamin D</strong></p></li><li><p>17:26 and now the treatment is for an indefinite period, demanding that patients do this revaluation</p></li><li><p>17:34 after two and five years, and maybe this time we will be able to establish</p></li><li><p>17:42 a criterion to determine if they can lower the dose and which of them should be pursued,</p></li><li><p>17:50 but at this time the treatment is maintained for an indefinite period.</p></li></ul><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>Video starts playing here normally.

For example:</p></li><li><p>24:37 under the effect of vitamin D, the immune system increases the amount of a type of cell</p></li><li><p>24:48 that are produced by the immune system with the aim to keep adjusted.</p></li><li><p>24:53 These are called <strong>&ldquo;regulatory T cells&rdquo;</strong> and the amount of these cells increases very much under the effect of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>25:04 Simultaneously, the reaction TH17, which is an abnormal reaction, not physiological,</p></li><li><p>25:12 aberrant, is selectively inhibited by vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>25:16 These 2 things are very important for the control of any autoimmune disease.</p></li><li><p>25:23 These autoimmune diseases that you mentioned such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn&rsquo;s disease and ulcerative colitis,</p></li><li><p>25:35 are cases that we have dealt with and responded in complete form.</p></li><li><p>25:44 The patient lives completely free from manifestations of the disease and maintain a normal life,</p></li><li><p>25:50 but we must also continue the diet I mentioned before. It can <strong>not ingest dairy products,</strong></p></li><li><p>25:58 no food or wholly made from milk and must also maintain hydration of at least 2.5 liters of water per day.</p></li><li><p>26:12 Again, autoimmune diseases you mentioned, so far all the cases,</p></li><li><p>26:19 which are not so many as the cases of multiple sclerosis, but are still dozens of cases,</p></li><li><p>26:26 all responded in full, without suffering the effects of vitamin D in high doses.</p></li><li><p>26:42 This question, in relation to the <strong>double-blind studies</strong> , it is very important because <strong>you can not randomize metabolic errors.</strong></p></li><li><p>27:00 What I mean is that if there is a person who has a metabolic problem diagnosed by laboratory</p></li><li><p>27:09 for example, a person with hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone),</p></li><li><p>27:16 which is potentially lethal and can cause damage to the health of the person, if it is not corrected.</p></li><li><p>27:27 Another example is the type 1 diabetes in children who do not produce insulin,</p></li><li><p>27:37 I am obliged to correct this deficiency and have to administer insulin.</p></li><li><p>27:45 So, in these circumstances, when the patient has a metabolic problem, a deficiency,</p></li><li><p>27:51 acquired resistance in hereditary form, in relation to a hormone or a vitamin, I am obliged to correct.</p></li><li><p>28:05 If I do not correct it, I make a mistake of medical negligence.</p></li><li><p>28:09 Then, when you&rsquo;re talking about a double-ciecorandomizzato, you&rsquo;re telling me</p></li><li><p>28:15 that I have to have a group of patients who will be treated, for example, with high doses of vitamin D</p></li><li><p>28:24 and a group of patients who receive a placebo;</p></li><li><p>28:28 and doctors and patients involved in this study are not aware</p></li><li><p>28:33 of which patients receiving vitamin D and which patients receiving the placebo.</p></li><li><p>28:40 Very well, I could not do these studies to children with diabetes, for example.</p></li><li><p>28:48 We&rsquo;ve never done a double-blind randomized to know</p></li><li><p>28:55 if the insulin is suitable for children with diabetes. Never did and never will.</p></li><li><p>29:00 The same thing happens with people who have hypothyroidism, because we are obliged to give a cure.</p></li><li><p>29:08 You will not ever done a double-blind, randomized, where a group will receive thyroid hormone and the other a placebo.</p></li><li><p>29:17 The same thing happens to the deficiency of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>29:21 A deficiency of vitamin B12 can cause a devastating neurological disorder that destroys the spinal cord,</p></li><li><p>29:30 so you can not leave a person with vitamin B12 deficiency, without treatment, because I would be remiss.</p></li><li><p>29:41 You can not leave a person with pellagra, which has a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3), because it can cause diarrhea,</p></li><li><p>29:59 dermatitis and even death. So, these people can not be left with a deficiency.</p></li><li><p>30:11 <strong>If I do a double-blind, randomized, I&rsquo;ll be careless with 50% of patients.</strong></p></li><li><p>30:20 <strong>The placebo group will be the victim of medical malpractice.</strong></p></li><li><p>30:25 This is a very important concept,</p></li><li><p>30:28 because today we try to tell the class that any result published in the medical literature</p></li><li><p>30:36 should not be considered if it was not the result of a double-ciecorandomizzato.</p></li><li><p>30:42 This is a big mistake.</p></li><li><p>30:45 People with vitamin D deficiency or resistance to the biological effects of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>30:53 for them this deficiency must be corrected and this resistance must be compensated with higher doses,</p></li><li><p>31:01 which are able to restore in this individual all the biological effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>31:07 So, there are no double-blind study ciecorandomizzato and we will not do with any patient,</p></li><li><p>31:15 because there are two main basic principles of medical practice, which is taught in all schools in the Western world.</p></li><li><p>31:32 The first principle is not to worsen the situation, not hurt,</p></li><li><p>31:41 not to act on your patient in a worse shape than his clinical situation.</p></li><li><p>31:49 And the second principle is that the patient should receive all possible benefits.</p></li><li><p>31:58 So, if I left a patient with vitamin D deficiency,</p></li><li><p>32:03 knowing that vitamin D is a great immunomodulator, perhaps the most potent immunomodulatory substance that exists in nature,</p></li><li><p>32:16 a patient who has an autoimmune disease and the immune system has not adjusted</p></li><li><p>32:23 and produces an immunological reaction aberrant, non-physiological, called TH17,</p></li><li><p>32:31 if I leave this patient with a deficiency of the unique substance that selectively, in a powerful form,</p></li><li><p>32:37 is able to inhibit this reaction TH17, producing regulatory lymphocytes, I&rsquo;ll be negligent towards this person.</p></li><li><p>32:47 <strong><span style=color:red>SoI will never do a double-blind, randomized and placebo using vitamin D</span></strong></p></li><li><p>32:57 <strong><span style=color:red>in people who have autoimmune diseases.</span></strong> Why? Why not do these things with my daughter,</p></li><li><p>33:02 with my wife and even with my patients.</p></li><li><p>33:13 We have started to use vitamin D in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in the interest of the patient.</p></li><li><p>33:21 Our goal was not looking, was not to convince anyone,</p></li><li><p>33:27 but was simply fulfill the 2nd basic principle of medical practice:</p></li><li><p>33:32 optimally benefit the patient</p></li><li><p>33:37 ie, if the patient has a deficiency of a potent immunoregulatory known and documented,</p></li><li><p>33:43 we need to correct this deficiency,</p></li><li><p>33:45 if it has a resistance, we need to increase the dose so that it can compensate for this deficiency.</p></li><li><p>33:54 Then, we have accumulated a lot of data over this period and we have gained experience in adjusting the dose for these patients.</p></li><li><p>34:08 We have published preliminary data on <a href=/posts/35000-iu-vitamin-d-daily-for-6-months-helped-all-psoriasis-suffers-106-ng-brazil>vitiligo and psoriasis</a>, and were the only diseases where we were able</p></li><li><p>34:25 being approved by the ethics committee of the medical-Unifesp (our university) research.</p></li><li><p>34:32 We wanted it to be implemented on other diseases, but unfortunately there are factors that many times we do not understand,</p></li><li><p>34:42 because they are negative with respect to the willingness to do a treatment that could bring benefits,</p></li><li><p>34:51 as we do not understand how you can deny the ethical conditions so that it is correct a deficiency in a patient.</p></li><li><p>35:03 I can not understand, but the answer was negative for certain diseases.</p></li><li><p>35:07 This did not stop us to continue to treat our patients according to their interests</p></li><li><p>35:14 and we have accumulated a wealth of experience in the cases very well documented.</p></li><li><p>35:20 And when we would have the opportunity, we will ask an ethics committee that would allow us to evaluate retrospectively these cases,</p></li><li><p>35:33 if this will be possible. Why we have rules for scientific publications.</p></li><li><p>35:42 Then, when it will submit a publication to a magazine where there are 2,500 patients treated with high doses of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>35:57 and want to publish the outcome of the cases, the publisher of the magazine will ask where is the approval of the Ethics Committee,</p></li><li><p>36:04 because otherwise we can not send our experience.</p></li><li><p>36:10 So, first we need to urge the Ethics Committee,</p></li><li><p>36:16 to approve in a review of the medical records of these patients.</p></li><li><p>36:21 With the review of the medical records we can send the material to the medical journal. Hopefully there are no problems</p></li><li><p>36:31 with regard to the retrospective review of the clinical history of the patients in the <strong>11 years of monitoring.</strong></p></li><li><p>36:39 But I do not know why sometimes some people make decisions not appropriate</p></li><li><p>36:58 with regard to the dissemination of knowledge and for the benefit of patients.</p></li><li><p>37:11 Yes, exactly, the success rate is similar to multiple sclerosis.</p></li><li><p>37:18 But it is important that it be said that when we published this work for <strong>psoriasis and vitiligo,</strong></p></li><li><p>37:24 we used a fixed dose for all patients of 35,000 units per day,</p></li><li><p>37:31 associated with a <strong>dairy-free diet to avoid the toxic effects to the kidneys, and plenty of hydration.</strong></p></li><li><p>37:40 At that time we did not use this method of adjustment of the dose for each individual patient.</p></li><li><p>37:48 We achieved these results by 95% of patients, when we used this method</p></li><li><p>37:57 Individual adjustment of the dose for each patient,</p></li><li><p>38:00 taking into account the response of the laboratory that each patient shows</p></li><li><p>38:06 through the comparison of laboratory tests, made before and after treatment, ie after 2 months.</p></li><li><p>38:18 Then the result, in other words, is passed to the 95% success,</p></li><li><p>38:26 when we started using this method of adjustment</p></li><li><p>38:32 on the response of laboratory tests for individual</p></li><li><p>38:34 that each patient according to a predetermined dose common.</p></li><li><p>38:47 Then, high doses of vitamin D work for autoimmune diseases in general.</p></li><li><p>38:54 Autoimmune neurological diseases where we used the vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>38:59 In addition to multiple sclerosis, are: the isolated <strong>optic neuritis</strong> ,</p></li><li><p>39:09 <strong>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), polyneuropathy of autoimmune origin,</strong></p></li><li><p>39:26 <strong>myasthenia gravis</strong> . These are the neurological disease of autoimmune origin that I remember at this time.</p></li><li><p>39:42 The result of this treatment, when we use the method of adjustment of the individual doses</p></li><li><p>39:50 for each patient was the same as in multiple sclerosis: <strong>95% of total suppression of autoimmunity.</strong></p></li><li><p>39:59 This does not mean that the older irreversible damage caused by the immune system,</p></li><li><p>40:06 considered as pre-existing damage, regress.</p></li><li><p>40:12 In general, we obtain as a result a complete or almost complete regression, of the lesions</p></li><li><p>40:20 that were formed in the period of 1 year prior to initiation of treatment with high doses of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>40:36 There are other diseases, whose appearance is favored or employee is</p></li><li><p>40:42 by the presence of a deficiency of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>40:45 For example, the recurrence of <strong>abortions in the first trimester of gestation.</strong></p></li><li><p>40:53 To date, this is considered an autoimmune disease.</p></li><li><p>40:56 The immune system rejects the implantation of the embryo.</p></li><li><p>41:00 This event is dependent on the presence of vitamin D deficiency</p></li><li><p>41:06 and a partial resistance to the biological effects of vitamin D. immunoregulatory</p></li><li><p>41:11 The presence of <strong>hypertension, high blood pressure or high at the end of pregnancy,</strong></p></li><li><p>41:19 situations in the so-called &ldquo;pre-eclampsia or eclampsia,&rdquo; putting at risk the life of the mother in late pregnancy,</p></li><li><p>41:29 that the obstetrician must anticipate the birth by cesarean.</p></li><li><p>41:39 All this can be prevented by administration of adequate doses of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>41:49 For proper dosages mean 10,000 units per day.</p></li><li><p>41:54 In addition, pregnant women who do not expose themselves to the sun in an appropriate manner,</p></li><li><p>41:59 thus favoring very low levels of vitamin D, they run a high risk of giving birth</p></li><li><p>42:06 children who can then develop a problem of <strong>autism</strong> .</p></li><li><p>42:11 Autism is highly favored by the deficiency of vitamin D during pregnancy and in the first years of life.</p></li><li><p>42:20 The vitamin D deficiency, occurring early in the life of an individual during the end of gestation</p></li><li><p>42:26 or in the first years of life, greatly increases the chance that this individual, when he reaches adolescence</p></li><li><p>42:33 developments psychiatric diseases such as, for example, <strong>schizophrenia</strong> .</p></li><li><p>42:38 Regardless of age, vitamin D insufficiency greatly enhances the appearance of depression.</p></li><li><p>42:48 <strong>Depressive processes</strong> are favored or induced due to the presence of vitamin D deficiency,</p></li><li><p>42:56 that is rarely taken into consideration by doctors today are treating people with depression.</p></li><li><p>43:05 It is important to mention <strong>diabetes</strong> .</p></li><li><p>43:10 Both the type 1, which is autoimmune, than that of type 2, which is that of maturity,</p></li><li><p>43:19 both are highly favored by the deficiency of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>43:24 Insulin production is favored by vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>43:29 Deficiency of vitamin D promotes the development of diabetes.</p></li><li><p>43:35 In the field of diabetes, the effects of vitamin D deficiency are the subject of much research.</p></li><li><p>43:52 These diseases are the most important to mention as regards their relationship with vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>44:06 I have no information about it, but it does not mean it does not exist,</p></li><li><p>44:14 that vitamin D may facilitate the removal of heavy metals from the body, I do not have this information.</p></li><li><p>44:23 I have a strong belief that the onset of autoimmune diseases depends primarily on three factors:</p></li><li><p>44:38 whether it be an individual who has inherited from the father or mother this predisposition,</p></li><li><p>44:47 which concerns a partial resistenzia to the biological effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>44:53 It also depends on a second factor is the deficiency of vitamin D, due to the lack of sun exposure.</p></li><li><p>45:03 And the third factor is the emotional factor.</p></li><li><p>45:08 The latter would be the trigger that leads to the activation of autoimmune diseases,</p></li><li><p>45:15 including multiple sclerosis,</p></li><li><p>45:18 in persons with the two other factors that predispose to developing this disease.</p></li><li><p>45:26 Only thing missing is the <strong>emotional factor triggering</strong></p></li><li><p>45:29 given by a life event high emotional stress. For example:</p></li><li><p>45:35 a teenager or a teenager living her parents&rsquo; separation;</p></li><li><p>45:40 an individual of 18, 19, 20 years of age who lives a break affective;</p></li><li><p>45:49 a person of 30-35 years which sees the dissolution of his marriage;</p></li><li><p>45:56 a great person who attends the unexpected death of his son.</p></li><li><p>46:04 They are emotional traumas that eventually lead to the activation of the impact of autoimuni diseases, including multiple sclerosis.</p></li><li><p>46:14 Given this experience, they have about 95% of patients with total control of the disease</p></li><li><p>46:24 using high doses of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>46:27 it is not that we are excluding other factors that can contribute to the process,</p></li><li><p>46:35 but if these factors are in fact contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases,</p></li><li><p>46:42 their role is very minority of less importance physio-pathological effects of vitamin D</p></li><li><p>46:50 or lack of imunomodulatori biological effects of vitamin D in our body.</p></li><li><p>47:04 Many researchers say that a person with multiple sclerosis,</p></li><li><p>47:10 having a neurological deficit that prevents her from walking freely,</p></li><li><p>47:19 tends to remain indoors, inside,</p></li><li><p>47:23 for this has less exposure to the sun and therefore has a lack of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>47:31 So the claim that vitamin D deficiency is a consequence of the disease and not the cause of the disease</p></li><li><p>47:38 and this would be the issue.</p></li><li><p>47:41 Well, this does not explain why, and already there are studies published in 1986,</p></li><li><p>47:54 when evaluating in a patient, in the course of a few years, the amount of relapses,</p></li><li><p>48:00 before and after being treated with vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>48:09 these relapses decreased dramatically after treatment. The number of relapses, called &ldquo;relapse&rdquo;, have decreased drastically.</p></li><li><p>48:19 This type of argument is excluding the crucial role of vitamin D, already well documented, as immunomodulator.</p></li><li><p>48:31 In other words, vitamin D inhibits reactions in reference to all diseases autoinmuni</p></li><li><p>48:38 and the reaction aberrant, non-physiological, called TH17.</p></li><li><p>48:42 Vitamin D increases the amount of immunoregulatory lymphocytes.</p></li><li><p>48:47 The level of vitamin D, how much more is high, the more will be the low activity of autoimmune disease; the lower level of vitamin D, the higher the activity of the autoimmune disease.</p></li><li><p>49:06 If you consider all these factors together, you will only have one explanation:</p></li><li><p>49:13 the lack of vitamin D leads to the autoimmune disease.</p></li><li><p>49:18 Another factor that can be aggregated to this set, which is only explained to mean a lack of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>49:29 as a determinant of the occurrence of autoimmune disease or auxiliary</p></li><li><p>49:33 is related to the difference of the equator,</p></li><li><p>49:36 <strong>as we move away from the equator, the more you experience the presence of autoimmune diseases.</strong></p></li><li><p>49:43 If you look at a country that is well away from the equator, such as Norway, for example,</p></li><li><p>49:53 we note that in the north of Norway the level of multiple sclerosis,</p></li><li><p>50:00 contrary to the rule of the equator, you see fewer cases of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis,</p></li><li><p>50:16 in relation to the south of Norway, where is located the city of Oslo.</p></li><li><p>50:20 This too can be explained in relation to vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>50:25 because in Northern Norway diet is basically composed of cosumo cold-water fish,</p></li><li><p>50:36 which are rich in fatty fish, such as cod or salmon, which fats contain high amounts of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>50:44 So we can reverse the rule of the equator when there is the presence of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>50:58 The same thing occurs in Switzerland, in the Swiss Alps, in the city located about <strong>2,000 meters above sea level,</strong></p></li><li><p>51:13 the amount of vitamin D in the blood is greater than that of the population in northern Switzerland</p></li><li><p>51:24 and the north of Switzerland Winey more at sea level. So why is this happening?</p></li><li><p>51:33 We can explain it by exposure to the sun.</p></li><li><p>51:36 In municipalities located in elavate heights, to a position above the clouds, it is subject to greater sun exposure.</p></li><li><p>51:45 Autoimmune diseases are not made easier because of the cold temperatures,</p></li><li><p>51:51 because if it were otherwise, there would be more in the Swiss Alps cases.</p></li><li><p>51:57 In the Swiss Alps there are fewer cases, because there is more sun exposure and as a result, more vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>52:08 In the north of Switzerland there is less exposure to the sun</p></li><li><p>52:13 and then smaller amounts of vitamin D circulating in the blood of the inhabitants, and therefore more autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>52:25 All of the epidemiology of autoimmune diseases, are made understandable by a single factor:</p></li><li><p>52:33 deficiency of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>52:38 You can get to consider a single factor,</p></li><li><p>52:41 single characteristic of epidemiological distribution of vitamin D and say, &ldquo;No, but there is an alternative explanations have,</p></li><li><p>52:55 people who are suffering from multiple sclerosis, those who have more severe forms of multiple sclerosis,</p></li><li><p>53:04 have a higher vitamin D deficiency because they are more closed in the house. "</p></li><li><p>53:07 It is an alternative explanation, but it does not explain all the other problems of the biological functions of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>53:18 all other epidemiological Characteristics of vitamin D. Epidemiological autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>53:41 The <strong>parathyroid hormone (PTH)</strong> is of extreme importance to us.</p></li><li><p>53:49 Why? Because when administering vitamin D, vitamin D inhibits the production of parathyroid hormone.</p></li><li><p>53:57 So, if I measure the parathyroid before starting to administer vitamin D and after 2 months,</p></li><li><p>54:05 I use the lowering of parathormone (PTH what has dropped with the administration of vitamin D)</p></li><li><p>54:14 I can use this as a parameter of the biological response to the effect of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>54:21 This is exactly the factor that we use to adjust the dose of vitamin D individually.</p></li><li><p>54:30 <strong>If the vitamin D inhibits the production of PTH,</strong></p></li><li><p>54:33 <strong>I increase the level of vitamin D until the PTH reaches the value lower than normal.</strong></p></li><li><p>54:40 Do not suppress PTH, I only increase the vitamin D until the PTH comes close to the lower limit</p></li><li><p>54:49 from the normal range of variation of PTH.</p></li><li><p>54:54 From the production of this biological effect, I conclude that if vitamin D has achieved the maximum effect in the inhibition of PTH,</p></li><li><p>55:05 must also have reached the maximum immunomodulatory effect.</p></li><li><p>55:11 And, through this premise, we adjust the dose of vitamin D depending dell&rsquo;abbassarsi of PTH.</p></li><li><p>55:21 I can not suppress PTH, so as to make it undetectable, because if you suppress,</p></li><li><p>55:31 I put the individual at risk.</p></li><li><p>55:35 <strong>He&rsquo;s taking a dose so high in vitamin D, which could subtract a large quatity of calcium from the bones.</strong></p></li><li><p>55:43 Increasing this excessive amount of calcium taken from the bones, and raising the concentration bleeds, it can impair renal function.</p></li><li><p>55:53 <strong>Thus, the parathyroid hormone for us is a safety measure, a level of security.</strong></p></li><li><p>56:03 If I do not suppress PTH, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not giving toxic doses of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>56:13 I can balance in relation to biological resistance to the effects of vitamin D on the grounds that that individual has genetic inheritance.</p></li><li><p>56:28 I say this in other words.</p></li><li><p>56:33 An individual may be in need of a dose of vitamin D, for example, 30,000 IU,</p></li><li><p>56:42 to make sure that his parathormone reaches the value less than normal.</p></li><li><p>56:46 <strong>Another individual may need to 100,000 IU to ensure that its PTH reaches this lower end of normal.</strong></p></li><li><p>56:55 Then, measure how much you lower the PTH, for us it is a way to adjust the dose of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>57:03 for the individual need of the patient.</p></li><li><p>57:10 <strong>The level of PTH is the most readily available laboratory tests,</strong></p></li><li><p>57:18 that can give us an idea of ​​the strength of the person to the effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>57:28 There are other possibilities, other factors that we can measure.</p></li><li><p>57:34 But the parathyroid hormone is made by all laboratories, it is not a great thing.</p></li><li><p>57:39 Many doctors ask the dose of PTH.</p></li><li><p>57:43 So, not a great test, a test is easily available at any place in the world.</p></li><li><p>57:59 Somehow, I have already answered this question.</p></li><li><p>58:06 <strong>A person who has a level of parathyroid near the upper limit of normal,</strong></p></li><li><p>58:130 <strong>this person probably has a level of vitamin D deficiency is very important.</strong></p></li><li><p>58:19 And they are getting calcium from the bones to maintain the calcium concentration of the blood,</p></li><li><p>58:26 since it does not have enough vitamin D to absorb calcium from the intestine,</p></li><li><p>58:32 from foods that transit in the intestine, which digests the intestine, due to the lack of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>58:38 Then, the person who has the parathormone near the upper limit of normal</p></li><li><p>58:44 or above the upper limit of normal, that person has a very severe vitamin D deficiency.</p></li><li><p>58:51 And this is something that varies so much for a person with an autoimmune disease,</p></li><li><p>58:57 As for a healthy person.</p></li><li><p>59:00 For example, if a person today has no autoimmune disease,</p></li><li><p>59:05 This does not mean you can not have an autoimmune disease at any stage of its future.</p></li><li><p>59:10 So, in terms of <strong>prevention,</strong></p></li><li><p>59:13 <strong>is very important that the person maintains its PTH level at least in the middle point,</strong></p></li><li><p>59:25 between the lower and upper value of the normal, through the administration of a realistic dose of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>59:33 Then, the same healthy person, taking vitamin D, 10,000 IU,</p></li><li><p>59:39 probably (not definitely, but probably) this dose will be sufficient to maintain</p></li><li><p>59:45 his parathormone inside the normal range of variation.</p></li><li><p>59:49 Or close to the upper limit or above the upper limit.</p></li><li><p>59:59 Yes, this is an important thing &mldr;</p></li><li><p>60:03 The labs have different ranges of variation (range) to assess the normality of the parathyroid hormone.</p></li><li><p>60:08 Then, a laboratory test that can tell he does, the way in which the measure parathyroid hormone,</p></li><li><p>60:17 the normal level varies, for example, between 4 - 58 pg / ml.</p></li><li><p>60:27 Another laboratory can say that for them the normal range is 12 to 65 pg / ml.</p></li><li><p>60:41 So, the question on the level below 20</p></li><li><p>60:46 is for people who use a lab that says the normal range of assessment is 12 to 65.</p></li><li><p>60:51 It therefore must be of between 20 and 12.</p></li><li><p>60:56 But a person who uses a second laboratory that says that the normal value is from 4 to 58,</p></li><li><p>61:08 then I must remain between 10 and 4.</p></li><li><p>61:11 The same thing that I explained earlier.</p></li><li><p>61:13 I must be close to the lower limit of normal, but not below the lower limit of normal.</p></li><li><p>61:19 I Doso vitamin D to achieve this effect.</p></li><li><p>61:23 So, you do not need to be under 20.</p></li><li><p>61:25 Below 20, or below 10, or between 12 and 20 or between 10 and 4, depends on what is the normal range</p></li><li><p>61:35 that uses the laboratory as a reference.</p></li><li><p>61:38 To which, depends on the laboratory.</p></li><li><p>61:49 <strong>We have not yet assessed whether a weekly regimen may be better or worse</strong></p></li><li><p>61:59 <strong>a daily dose, or if a monthly administration may be better or worse</strong></p></li><li><p>62:08 <strong>of once per week.</strong></p></li><li><p>62:10 We have not done any study in this regard.</p></li><li><p>62:14 We started from the assumption that only a good rule is that a person is exposed to the sun every day.</p></li><li><p>62:23 So, if this is the norm, we try to adjust the dose according to the daily administration,</p></li><li><p>62:31 and this is justified by the fact that you avoid large variations</p></li><li><p>62:38 caused by doses very distanzati one another.</p></li><li><p>62:42 So, when we administer on a daily basis,</p></li><li><p>62:46 the variation of the concentration sanguingna you keep more regular, less swinging,</p></li><li><p>62:55 and the magnitude of change will be minor.</p></li><li><p>63:07 Who makes 10,000 units per day is taking a physiological dose,</p></li><li><p>63:12 the same dose that would produce his skin when exposed to the sun for twenty minutes without sunscreen,</p></li><li><p>63:21 wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts,</p></li><li><p>63:24 in other words, leaving the arms and legs exposed to the sun, being a person of fair skin and young.</p></li><li><p>63:29 So, this may not cause any problem to anyone because it is the amount that we produce normally.</p></li><li><p>63:37 So, there is no necessity to go on a diet or any special hydration,</p></li><li><p>63:41 in addition to that every individual should normally do to stay healthy.</p></li><li><p>63:47 There is no need to take any precautions when taking 10,000 IU of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>63:53 <strong>My daughter takes 10,000 units of vitamin D per day for more than six years.</strong></p></li><li><p>63:59 There is no problem in taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day,</p></li><li><p>64:04 there is no need to take any precautionary measure.</p></li><li><p>64:07 This, for sure, it is not a toxic dose,</p></li><li><p>64:11 this dose is sold without a prescription in the United States without any problem.</p></li><li><p>64:25 <strong>So, do not really know of any effect of vitamin D on the normal intestinal flora</strong> . If there is a publication in this regard is not to my knowledge.</p></li><li><p>64:48 Because Vitamin D increases the power of reaction against the agents of disease,</p></li><li><p>64:59 we can also expect that vitamin D reduces the presence of harmful bacteria in the gut. This hope.</p></li><li><p>65:17 I have no information that says that vitamin D may alter harmful form in the digestive tract.</p></li><li><p>65:26 It is possible that the lack of vitamin D deficiency is likely to affect the work of the digestive system,</p></li><li><p>65:38 given that all our cells, including those of the digestive system, respond biologically to the effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>65:51 Alters its funzzioni in relation to the effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>65:58 <strong>The proper activity of the digestive tract can be stimulated with the correction of the deficiency of vitamin D.</strong></p></li><li><p>66:05 But, harmful effects caused by high doses of vitamin D (unless they are toxic, that is accompanied by a corresponding increase of calcium in the blood),</p></li><li><p>66:19 harmful effects to the digestive system, there may be with the use of high doses of vitamin D, calibrated according to the laboratory tests.</p></li><li><p>66:32 With regard to the vitamin D receptors,</p></li><li><p>66:36 There are various diseases that are linked to genetic mutations in the vitamin D receptor,</p></li><li><p>66:47 making these people resistant to vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>66:54 The emergence of this resistance may be due to the fact that the individual in question has altered</p></li><li><p>67:06 the enzyme that takes care of the activation of vitamin D, which are two hydroxylase.</p></li><li><p>67:16 The individual may have an alteration of the first hydroxylase, the second hydroxylase,</p></li><li><p>67:24 may have an alteration of the vitamin D receptor that is present in the cells, the objective of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>67:33 The idividuo may also have a genetic alteration of the protein that captures hereditary vitamin D and charge with it into the bloodstream.</p></li><li><p>67:48 So, there are several genetic disorders that may explain the resistance of the individual assimilation of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>68:05 An individual also may need a lot more vitamin D to the fact of having an <strong>overweight</strong> for his height.</p></li><li><p>68:16 <strong>Older people have then a lesser amount of vitamin D receptors in every single cell:</strong></p></li><li><p>68:27 decreases the concentration of vitamin D receptors in every single cell with increasing age.</p></li><li><p>68:33 There are so many points that explain why in some cases a person sees increased its partial resistance to the effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>68:45 An individual may be suffering from two or three of these points that contribute to its resistance to the effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>68:55 For this, we use the final effect of this chain, which is the reduction in the levels of parathyroid hormone.</p></li><li><p>69:06 It &rsquo; a way to avoid having to check what is actually the reason for the resistance.</p></li><li><p>69:20 It does not matter if the reason is this, that is, or if there are multiple reasons for this resistance to concomitant vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>69:28 Measuring the biological effect, which is the reduction of the levels of parathyroid hormone,</p></li><li><p>69:32 we see the final effect of all these possible points of resistance to vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>69:39 and is a way to optimize our work, and then to the best biological effect of vitamin D for that individual, regardless of the reason for which has a resistance.</p></li><li><p>70:00 We simplify the whole measuring only a biological effect, which would be the reduction in the levels of parathyroid hormone.</p></li><li><p>70:14 Yes, because when you produce vitamin D in the skin or ingested vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>70:23 you are ingesting the inactive form of vitamin D, which is called colicalciferolo.</p></li><li><p>70:29 This colicalciferolo undergoes the action of two enzymes, in a consecutive manner, to be transformed into the final shape,</p></li><li><p>70:39 which is precisely the active form.</p></li><li><p>70:41 Then, the colicalciferolo undergoes the action of an enzyme called 25-hydroxylase, which adds a chemical group</p></li><li><p>70:50 called hydroxyl in position 25 of the molecule of colicalciferolo,</p></li><li><p>70:56 colicalciferolo turning this into calcidiol-25-hydroxy-vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>71:03 that is measured in the blood to detect whether or not the individual has deficiency.</p></li><li><p>71:09 In turn this substance, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D or calcidiol, undergoes the action of a second hydroxylase, which adds</p></li><li><p>71:21 another chemical group in position 1. Therefore, this enzyme, which is called 1-alpha-hydroxylase, can be genetically altered.</p></li><li><p>71:32 Finally, it produces, through the second hydroxylase, the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy D3 call</p></li><li><p>71:44 or calcitriol, which will then produce the final biological effect on the immune system and over all the cells in our body.</p></li><li><p>71:55 Very well, these are dependent hydroxylase by vitamin B2,</p></li><li><p>72:01 not directly, but indirectly,</p></li><li><p>72:08 because in the step of hydroxylation of vitamin D, enzymes oxidize,</p></li><li><p>72:19 and so that we can pick up a new molecule, hydroxylate another molecule, therefore,</p></li><li><p>72:25 must be reduced, chemically called reduction process. And this reduction process requires the presence of vitamin B2.</p></li><li><p>72:36 <strong>About 10-15% of the general population, the world in general,</strong></p></li><li><p>72:44 <strong>has great difficulty in absorbing vitamin B2.</strong> This is another genetic alteration that concerns IL10-15% of the population.</p></li><li><p>72:55 In some regions of Italy who have had malaria endemic throughout the centuries, from 300 BC</p></li><li><p>73:07 this percentage may be higher, it can reach 50% of the individuals concerned</p></li><li><p>73:17 and these regions generally correspond to the peninsula of the Po, which is the region of Venice and another region on the west side of Italy &mldr;</p></li><li><p>73:33 Another region that has had cases of malaria endemic in the course of several centuries, from 300 BC</p></li><li><p>73:40 is Sardinia, where there have been cases of malaria endemic throughout the centuries.</p></li><li><p>73:44 And, apparently, the people who had difficulty in absorbing vitamin B2 from food were resitenti to malaria,</p></li><li><p>73:56 therefore, the children who had this genetic problem that they died of malaria in infancy,</p></li><li><p>74:03 could pass into adulthood and passed on their genes to future generations,</p></li><li><p>74:09 Unlike children who had this genetic alteration and were susceptible to malaria.</p></li><li><p>74:17 So, most of the children who did not have this genetic alteration were dying of malaria in childhood</p></li><li><p>74:25 and could not pass on their genes to future generations, reach adulthood and pass on their genes to the next generation.</p></li><li><p>74:32 So, over the centuries, there was a natural selection in these regions of Italy are a lot more people</p></li><li><p>74:40 with difficulty absorbing vitamin B2, riboflavin, compared to the rest of the world population,</p></li><li><p>74:48 where it has about 10-15% of individuals with this difficulty absorbing riboflavin.</p></li><li><p>74:59 In these regions of Italy, individuals descended from Italians, who also live in Brazil and are descended from Italian</p></li><li><p>75:06 that come from those regions of Italy, have a greater chance of being carriers of this difficulty to absorb riboflavin.</p></li><li><p>75:14 <strong>This (lack of B2) can contribute to resistance to vitamin D,</strong></p></li><li><p>75:17 because sometimes hydroxylase, in the absence of an adequate level of vitamin B2, will malfunction</p></li><li><p>75:25 and will be another factor that will contribute to the resistance to vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>75:32 So, for this reason, so that we should not be dosed vitamin B2 in all individuals,</p></li><li><p>75:37 since it is not a test readily available in laboratories and the health care system does not cover these tests,</p></li><li><p>75:49 not for the determination of vitamin B2, <strong>we administer vitamin B2, which is absolutely harmless,</strong></p></li><li><p>75:56 <strong>to all individuals, in a dose greater than that normally given, with the aim to cover the shortage &mldr;</strong></p></li><li><p>76:07 We <strong>measured the phosphorus</strong> because vitamin D is mobilizing calcium and phosphorus from the bone.</p></li><li><p>76:15 And since we are using unpublished doses of vitamin D, this was also a suggestion</p></li><li><p>76:23 Professor <strong>Michael Holick</strong> , so we dovumentare everything that&rsquo;s going on.</p></li><li><p>76:31 One of our concerns is that it is not altered phosphorus;</p></li><li><p>76:40 that phosphorus levels are not altered.</p></li><li><p>76:44 In fact, the dose we use, with these precautions, do not alter the levels of phosphorus.</p></li><li><p>76:50 It&rsquo;s just a precaution</p></li><li><p>76:53 to have the certainty that the patients are well from the point of view workshop.</p></li><li><p>76:59 All the laboratory parameters that can be altered for the use of high doses of vitamin D are measured</p></li><li><p>77:07 and this is just one of them.</p></li><li><p>77:10 This is the reason for which we measure the levels of phosphorus.</p></li><li><p>77:22 Patients with <strong>kidney failure</strong> , for us it is a big problem</p></li><li><p>77:27 giving them high doses of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>77:30 Because if I give a dose of vitamin D that causes excessive absorption of calcium, both of the bones of the intestine,</p></li><li><p>77:40 I have to make sure that the kidneys expel him;</p></li><li><p>77:44 However, if a person has the `kidney failure, I lose this certainty.</p></li><li><p>77:49 So if a person has a kidney failure, this causes a lot more work,</p></li><li><p>77:57 we have a lot more care than a person who has normal kidney function.</p></li><li><p>78:04 Qusta is the only thing I can say <code>on</code> renal failure.</p></li><li><p>78:08 There are diseases such as systemic <strong>lupus</strong> erythematosus, in which the immune system attacks the kidneys.</p></li><li><p>78:16 We try to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; lupus before it causes renal injury.</p></li><li><p>78:23 If the person already has renal lesions we have a lot more care.</p></li><li><p>78:28 We start with a low dose of vitamin D for security that nothing will happen to the person.</p></li><li><p>78:35 There is a need that the kidneys expel the excess calcium that is formed in the circulation</p></li><li><p>78:43 and if the person has a kidney failure this becomes a problem.</p></li><li><p>78:58 G6PD deficiency is one of the diseases which have increased in Italy as a result of endemic malaria.</p></li><li><p>79:11 People with G6PD deficiency are resistant to malaria.</p></li><li><p>79:19 It is the same type of natural selection that has happened with the deficiency of riboflavin.</p></li><li><p>79:28 But I have no data to show me that vitamin D deficiency and G6PD are incompatible things,</p></li><li><p>79:38 in the sense, that it can not give vitamin D to people who have deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,</p></li><li><p>79:46 which is called G6PD.</p></li><li><p>79:49 I see no incompatibility.</p></li><li><p>80:03 I do not have this information, that vitamin D may help people with <strong>dystonia</strong> .</p></li><li><p>80:10 For now I do not have, but I can do a search,</p></li><li><p>80:16 because vitamin D is a substance that has many functions,</p></li><li><p>80:26 all cells respond to vitamin D;</p></li><li><p>80:31 the fact that I have no information on this, or the fact that there has been no published study on the relationship between vitamin D and dystonia,</p></li><li><p>80:40 these things are not to indicate that vitamin D may not be beneficial to people with dystonia.</p></li><li><p>80:45 But I do not own the `information available at this time.</p></li><li><p>80:59 No, we have no patient with adrenoleukodystrophy, which is a metabolic disease.</p></li><li><p>81:05 There is a direct relationship with vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>81:09 Many people who have <strong>degenerative diseases of the nervous system</strong> , can potentially be favored</p></li><li><p>81:17 a reasonable dosage of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>81:21 Surely, these people can not stay with vitamin D deficiency, because you sovvraporrebbero two factors:</p></li><li><p>81:30 the genetic disorder, hereditary, metabolic, just one disease and, in addition, deficiency of vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>81:37 which can accelerate the progression of the disease.</p></li><li><p>81:40 Then, we suggest to people who have neurological or metabolic diseases that do not have a direct relationship with vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>81:51 suggest that they should, most of the other people, to maintain normal levels of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>82:00 We do not recommend high doses of vitamin D, but only <strong>normal doses of 10,000 IU per day.</strong></p></li><li><p>82:10 These people have to worry, most of the other people, not to be deficient in vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>82:25 For a patient who takes these anticoagulants with vitamin D?</p></li><li><p>82:31 Basic there is no incompatibility with the vitamin D, to make the treatment with the vitamin D,</p></li><li><p>82:39 or high dose of vitamin D, always observing precautions: diet and hydration.</p></li><li><p>82:48 We have no information that would cause any problems with the `use of anticoagulants.</p></li><li><p>82:56 A warning is important for people suffering from <strong>hyperthyroidism</strong> , or high levels of thyroid hormones,</p></li><li><p>83:09 and that do not take drugs or do not follow treatment that maintains normal levels of thyroid hormones,</p></li><li><p>83:22 these people can be very sensitive to the toxic effects of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>83:28 The thyroid hormone potentiates the effect of vitamin D in mobilizing calcium from the bones.</p></li><li><p>83:37 These people are more sensitive to vitamin D, those with untreated hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled.</p></li><li><p>83:46 This is a notice, we have had two cases of people who developed hyperthyroidism,</p></li><li><p>83:55 which have become more sensitive to vitamin D than it usually occurs;</p></li><li><p>84:03 the level of sensitivity of these people is higher than those that have the normal thyroid function.</p></li><li><p>84:17 Yes, we say to patients who need to take <strong>antibiotics or anti-inflammatory drugs that are toxic to the kidneys,</strong></p></li><li><p>84:29 which should increase hydration. Do not just drink 2.5 liters of fluid,</p></li><li><p>84:35 but an extra liter: <strong>3.5 liters of fluid a day,</strong></p></li><li><p>84:39 Because when the drug passes to the kidneys, in this way is diluted and decreases the nephrotoxic effect, that is toxic to the kidneys.</p></li><li><p>84:59 The person who assumes 10,000 units of vitamin D takes the same dose of vitamin D</p></li><li><p>85:04 that a young man would if dressed in leather short-sleeved shirt and shorts,</p></li><li><p>85:12 leaving arms and legs exposed to the sun, a young person and clear skin, without the use of sunscreen,</p></li><li><p>85:22 would produce 10,000 IU of vitamin D, which can not be considered a toxic dose of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>85:32 And there is not no need to do laboratory tests or to be under medical supervision,</p></li><li><p>85:38 for the simple fact that an adult is taking 10,000 units of vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>85:43 This, however, is not valid when it comes to children;</p></li><li><p>85:45 underweight children, this dose may be excessive.</p></li><li><p>85:59 Yes, it is important that the symposium has both a logical and productive;</p></li><li><p>86:04 which allows to get in touch with professionals willing to work with this protocol,</p></li><li><p>86:16 using vitamin D in favor of the patients, in this case we have any interest.</p></li><li><p>86:24 Unproductive would go to Italy only to do what you&rsquo;re doing right now here,</p></li><li><p>86:35 that is, only to orient the audience, because only be repeating the same things.</p></li><li><p>86:40 The medical staff was concerned, other professionals who are interested in the results of this treatment,</p></li><li><p>86:50 can ask technical questions that have not been made here today.</p></li><li><p>87:04 So, in this situation it would be very produtivo a trip to Italy,</p></li><li><p>87:11 for the amount of people that can have a benefit with this treatment,</p></li><li><p>87:16 for young people who may be blind or paraplegic due to multiple sclerosis</p></li><li><p>87:23 or who might suffer for a lifetime effects of a disease such as inflammation of the colon, and many others already mentioned.</p></li><li><p>87:34 The presence of a professional in Italy and put into practice this treatment,</p></li><li><p>87:42 would provide a benefit to people who live in Italy immeasurable.</p></li><li><p>87:52 You have no idea of ​​the benefits that you might have.</p></li><li><p>87:56 And he would have the same satisfaction, the same level of gratitude, immense, that we are receiving,</p></li><li><p>88:03 keeping people above the impact (&ldquo;high&rdquo;) of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune diseases.</p></li><li><p>88:08 We lose a patient when it reaches the expected result (&ldquo;high&rdquo;),</p></li><li><p>88:14 but receive as reward a friend for life and this is something that is priceless.</p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/antibiotics.html><span class=tag>antibiotics</span></a>
