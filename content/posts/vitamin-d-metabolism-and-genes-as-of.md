 **Summary and Perspective** 

The dual origin of vitamin D, discovered about a century ago, first evolved into a rather simple metabolic schema of constitutive 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D in the liver to produce 25OHD, followed by a tightly regulated 1Î±-hydroxylation by a unique CYP27B1 in a unique organ (kidney) to generate 1,25(OH)2D as ligand of a nuclear receptor, VDR. All these metabolites are transported by a single serum binding protein and are finally catabolized by a unique nearly ubiquitous CYP24A1. The present picture is much more complex with a large number of enzymes expressed in a variety of cells. Most of these genes contain genetic polymorphisms that may alter their function and are regulated by hormones and/or metabolic signaling that can vary in different tissues of the body. Finally, the vitamin D endocrine system regulates a large number of vertebrate genes. These recent findings reveal that the vitamin D endocrine system is much more complex than initially thought and remains still incompletely understood.
