* Autism

* Pregnancy

#### <span style="color:#F00;">10,000 IU during pregnancy </span>

 **| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 10,000 IU | normally |
| Raise head  | 22 days | 90 days |
| Start to speak  | 2.5 months | 12 months |

#### Must avoid giving <span style="color:#F00;">Folic acid</span> to pregnant women (Folate is OK)

Strong indications that Folic Acid is increasing Autism rate

 **2X to 6X more Vitamin D is needed if poor gene** 

 **Vitamin D Metabolism**

 **Vitamin B2** 

* low in 10-15% of everyone, 

* Low in 80% of those with autoimmune disorders

#### Protocol essentially consists of:

1. High Vitamin D

> (and Vitamin B2 and Magnesium)

1. Low Calcium

1. 2.5 liters of water

1. Low-stress life (stress increases MS)

 **Treatment ramp-up takes 2 years**

#### Comments to VitaminDWiki by a member of the audience: Barbara M van Amerongen

Coimbra thinks autism is caused by synthetic methylfolate made by pharma.

There were at least 400 people present, mostly German doctors. The type that desperately want to cure patients (with food and supplements). 

They almost gave Coimbra a standing ovation. Hij spoke on Friday and on Saturday. 

The Program on Friday 13 April: International Workshop Vitamin D Sensitivity and High Dose Vitamin D Therapy included a Discussion and possible next steps between a panel (among which the 3 speakers Holick, Carlberg and Coimbra and a few others) and the chairman Prof. Spitz. (This was about the Coimbra Protocol.) 

At the end when the time was up the audience was allowed to make remarks.

I think Vitamin D3 / the Coimbra Protocol is going to go viral in Germany.
