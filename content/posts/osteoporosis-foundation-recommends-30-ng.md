# International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) releases new position on Vitamin D recommendations for older adults.

This month the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF)joined the growing number of international organizations that officially recognize the importance of daily Vitamin D3 supplementation.

The recommendation resulted from examination of all available data on Vitamin D's effect on bone and muscle strength and the prevention of falls in the elderly.

IOF recognize that preventing Vitamin D deficiency has a major impact in preventing falls and fractures in the elderly, both of which play a major role in increasing mortality and morbidity.

IOF recommends that sufficient Vitamin D should be taken daily to maintain a level of at least  **30ng/ml.** They advise that the dose of Vitamin D3 necessary to reach this level is between 1000-2000 IU per day and that high risk individuals should have their Vitamin D levels monitored to ensure adequate dosing.

The lead author of the statement, Professor Bess Dawson-Hughes of Tufts University, US stated that, "Global Vitamin D status shows widespread insufficiency and deficiency. This high prevalence of suboptimal levels raises the possibility that many falls and fractures can be prevented with vitamin D supplementation. This is a relatively easy public health measure that could have significant positive effects on the incidence of osteoporotic fractures."

This statement is an important addition to the already significant number of major institutions that have endorsed Vitamin D supplementation. Below is a summary with links to those recommendations:
