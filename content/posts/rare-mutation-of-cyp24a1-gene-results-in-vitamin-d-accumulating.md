#### Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease revealing a hypersensitivity to vitamin D - 2017

Joint Bone Spine. 2017 Jan 18. pii: S1297-319X(16)30209-3. [doi: 10.1016/j.jbspin.2016.11.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbspin.2016.11.006)

* CYP24A1 functions to remove excess activated vitamin D from the body

* A rare mutation of the gene results in Vitamin D accumulating in the body

* It is no surprise that this would result in hypersensitivity  to Vitamin D

* Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease used to be called pseudogout

* This gene malfunction is a rare cause of pseudogout

* No indications of exactly how rare this is in either the abstract or online

OBJECTIVE:

Hypersensitivity to vitamin D (HVD) due to a loss of function mutation of the CYP24A1 gene, which encodes vitamin D catabolizing enzyme was initially described as a cause of acute hypercalcemia in children and chronic renal diseases in adults.

METHODS:

We describe the first case of a patient presenting a calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) revealing a HVD.

RESULTS:

An abnormality of phospho-calcic metabolism was discovered during the course of an etiological workup for CPDD in a 52-year-old patient. Laboratory tests revealed a blood calcium level at the upper limit of normal range, a markedly low parathormone level, a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level within the upper level of normal, an elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level and an elevated urine calcium level. CYP24A1 gene sequencing analysis revealed two mutations in a heterozygous state. The study of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3: 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ratio, two metabolites of vitamin D confirmed the enzyme deficiency in vivo. Our observation suggests that this disease could correspond to a rare cause of CPDD.

CONCLUSION:

In cases of CPDD associated with calcium values within the upper limit of normal range (or hypercalcemia) with an abnormally low PTH, one could suggest searching for HVD.
