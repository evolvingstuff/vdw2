Adv Biomed Res. 2017 May 2;6:55. [doi: 10.4103/2277-9175.205528.](https://doi.org/10.4103/2277-9175.205528.) eCollection 2017.

BACKGROUND:

Peripheral neuropathy is a common complaint of diabetes. This study aimed to determine the effects of 12 weeks combined training with Vitamin D supplement on improvement of sensory-motor neuropathy in women with diabetic neuropathy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This clinical trial study conducted on 90 patients were selected and randomly divided into two groups. Finally, 81 adult females with diabetes type II (20-55 years old) were interred in this study. The control group had no training, but received Vitamin D. The experimental group received Vitamin D and 12 weeks training program (3 days a week, 60 min/session) including aerobic exercises, strength, and flexibility. Aerobic exercise intensity was set at 60-70% maximum heart rate and resistance training intensity was determined by 10 R.M. Michigan neuropathy questionnaire, reflex hammer and tuning fork 128 Hz used to screening tense of neuropathy (Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument) that were used for pretest and posttest.

RESULTS:

Following 3 months combined training and supplementation with Vitamin D, had observed a significant reduction in 

* numbness (P = 0.001), 

* pain (0.002), tingling (P = 0.001), and 

* weakness (P = 0.002) in the lower limb and also 

* increases in sense of touch intervention (P = 0.005), 

* detects the position of the fingers (P = 0.001) and 

* vibration perception (P = 0.001) in tissues. 

* Knee reflexes (P = 0.77) and ankles reflexes (P = 0.47) did not significantly change after interventions.

CONCLUSION: It seems that taking part in combined training and supplementation with Vitamin D can improve the symptoms of sensory-motor neuropathy.
