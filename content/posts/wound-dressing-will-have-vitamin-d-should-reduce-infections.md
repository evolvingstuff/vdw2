#### [Nanofibre wound dressings may help tackle surgical site infections](https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/news/nanofibre-wound-dressings-may-help-tackle-surgical-site-infections/) Press Release

* "Prepared using electrospinning, the wound dressings were able to trigger the production of an antimicrobial peptide called hCAP18/LL37 at the site of infection. The peptide disrupts the membranes of microbes and destroys them."

* “The mechanism of these dressings to improve immune responses instead of containing single-target antimicrobial compounds is expected to reduce the risk of drug resistance.”

* "Findings revealed that the dressings could deliver vitamin D on a sustained basis over **four weeks** "

* “Electrospun nanofibre wound dressings offer significant advantages over hydrogels or sponges for local drug delivery. They provide several functional and structural advantages, including scar-free healing.”

* {In the US, approximately 300,000 patients develop an infection within 30 days of their surgical operation per year, more than 13,000 of which die from."

* The study is at https://doi.org/10.2217/nnm-2018-0011

 **Vitamin D have been proven to help many kinds of skin problems  
Vitamin D supplementation especially helps whenit can be applied to the area that needs it, rather than the entire body (orally)**
