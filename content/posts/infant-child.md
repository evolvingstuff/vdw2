#### Overview

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

* No consensus on MINIMUM International Units (IU) for healthy infant of normal weight

* 400 IU Vitamin D is no longer enough

> Was OK in the past century, but D levels have been dropping for a great many reasons.

 **Need even more IUs of vitamin D to get a good level if;** 

* Have little vitamin D: [premie](/posts/many-preemies-need-at-least-800-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct), twin, mother did not get much sun access

* Get little vitamin D: dark skin, little access to sun

* Vitamin D is consumed faster than normal due to sickness

* Older (need at least 100 IU/kilogram, far more if obese)

* Not get any vitamin D from formula (breast fed) or (fortified) milk

> Note – formula does not even provide 400 IU of vitamin D daily

 **Infants-Children need Vitamin D** 

* Sun is great – well known for 1,000’s of years.

> US govt (1934) even said infants should be out in the sun

* One country recommended 2,000 IU daily for decades – with no known problems

* As with adults, infants and children can have loading doses and rarely need tests

* Daily dose appears to be best, but monthly seems OK 

* Vitamin D is typically given to infants in the form of drops  

> &nbsp; &nbsp; big difference in taste between brands

> &nbsp; &nbsp; can also use water-soluable form of vitamin D in milk, food, juice,

* Infants have evolved to get a big boost of vitamin D immediately after birth

> Colostrum has 3X more vitamin D than breast milk - provided the mother has any vitamin D to spare

Objective: Using multivariate statistics and social network analysis techniques, we present a realistic and intuitive visualization of the research hotspots and development trends of vitamin D in children.

Methods: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term “vitamin D” was used to search all the publications (the study subjects were 0–18 years old) included in PubMed by time period. The subject terms for each development stage were extracted, the high-frequency subject terms were extracted using the Bibliographic Items Co-occurrence Matrix Builder (BICOMB), and a core subject term co-occurrence matrix was established. The Netdraw function of Ucinet 6.0 software was used to complete the social network drawing of the core subject term co-occurrence matrix to form a co-word network diagram composed of core subject terms.

Results: Prior to 1979, there were 890 papers with 1,899 core subject terms; from 2010 to 2020, there were 3,773 papers with 12,682 core subject terms. Before 1979, the research direction of vitamin D in children focused on vitamin D in the classical regulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. From 1980 to 1989, studies focused on vitamin D metabolites and therapeutic drugs such as “calcitriol” and “calcifediol.” From 1990 to 1999, studies focused on “calcitriol” and its association with “psoriasis,” “chronic renal failure,” and “dermatological drugs.” From 2000 to 2009, studies focused on “vitamin D” and “vitamin D deficiency.” From 2010 to 2020, studies focused on “vitamin D3” and its association with “vitamins,” “bone mineral density protectants,” “asthma,” “obesity,” “pregnancy complications” and “fetal blood.”

Conclusion: Since 2010, the research direction of vitamin D in children has been growing rapidly, and the overall development trend is good. Studies extend from the study of the skeletal effect of vitamin D to the study of its extraskeletal effect and the investigation of mechanisms of its association with related diseases.
