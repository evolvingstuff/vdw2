&lt;p>In the last few weeks, I (Dr. Cannell) received the two letters below. I was so glad to find out that I may be wrong, that adults with autism – not just young children – may be helped with vitamin D.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dear-dr-cannell">Dear Dr. Cannell:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We talked a couple months back about my autistic 3 year old son (now 4). As you suggested, I began giving him 5000 IU of Vitamin D daily. Since starting the vitamin D, I have seen the following improvements;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autism 3X more likely after closely spaced pregnancy vs 3 year apart</title><link>/posts/autism-3x-more-likely-after-closely-spaced-pregnancy-vs-3-year-apart.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-3x-more-likely-after-closely-spaced-pregnancy-vs-3-year-apart.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="closely-spaced-pregnancies-might-up-autism-risk-study">Closely Spaced Pregnancies Might Up Autism Risk: Study&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>By Jenifer Goodwin, HealthDay Reporter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MONDAY, Jan. 10 (HealthDay News) &amp;ndash; Having babies close together may triple the risk of autism in the second child, new research suggests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The highest risk was seen in babies conceived within a year of their older sibling. Babies conceived within 12 to 23 months and 24 to 35 months of their older sibling were also at a heightened risk of autism, although the risk was not as pronounced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A series of short e-books on vitamin D</title><link>/posts/a-series-of-short-e-books-on-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/a-series-of-short-e-books-on-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="autism-and-vitamin-d--emilys-story">Autism and Vitamin D – Emily’s Story&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Objective:? To examine the rates of autism separately according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin in respect to the vitamin D insufficiency hypothesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Method:? Articles were identified by electronic searches. Studies were selected when they analysed autism rates according to maternal immigrant status and/or ethnic origin using multivariate techniques.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autism and vitamin D Newsletter</title><link>/posts/autism-and-vitamin-d-newsletter.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autism-and-vitamin-d-newsletter.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-vitamin-d-council-newsletter-december-2010httpwwwvitamindcouncilorgnewslettermore-autism-reportsshtml">&lt;a href="http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/newsletter/more-autism-reports.shtml">The Vitamin D Council Newsletter December 2010&lt;/a>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The main reason scientists will not accept case reports on vitamin D improving autism is that scientists know (correctly) that autism is a genetic disease. Everyone knows that genetic diseases are generally incurable because we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to remove the bad genes and insert some good ones. I left medical school thinking of my genome as something I inherited at birth and left to my children in the marriage bed, without giving much thought to what my genome does for me in between.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
