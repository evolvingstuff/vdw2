In the Western world, the majority of morbidity and mortality are caused by multifactorial diseases. Some risk factors are related to more than one type of disease. These so-called universal risk factors are highly relevant to the population, as reduction of universal risk factors may reduce the prevalence of several types of multifactorial disease simultaneously. Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally seen as an etiological factor in bone disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia. 

Recent studies also suggest a role for vitamin D deficiency in multifactorial disorders, including progressive renal function loss and cardiovascular disease; it is also a risk factor for frailty. The potentially pleiotropic effects of vitamin D analogues support the  **hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a universal risk factor** . Here we review molecular actions of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), to identify mechanisms and pathways for vitamin D deficiency as a universal risk factor. To identify genes directly regulated by the VDR, we searched for genes containing vitamin D response elements (VDREs). A further refinement was made by selecting only VDRE-containing genes with documented modulation by VDR analogues in vivo. 

Our search yielded a limited number of factors possibly related to pleiotropic effects of vitamin D, including  **growth factors, hormones, inflammatory factors and factors related to calcium homeostasis** . 

Results from observational, intervention and mechanistic studies indicate that vitamin D is a universal risk factor involved in diverse multifactorial conditions. Further exploration of the multifaceted actions of vitamin D may pave the way for disease-overriding intervention strategies. PMID: 20795934
