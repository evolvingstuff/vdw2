## This page attempts to show one aspect of how VitaminDWiki can  support vitamin D information sharing

# Idea => outline => get co-authors/group => write => publish => review/appraisal => append update/revision (optional)

* Fast

> Approximately 1 month instead of 10 months.

* Free 

> Not have to justify cost of publishing (> $1,000) an idea to their boss, spouse . . . 

* Anyone can publish

> Person does not have to have been “an author”, and have gotten approval

> GPs, Nurses, Pharmacists, lay people can all ‘publish’ on this wikipedia-like service

* The publication can be of any size

> From just a paragraph up to a book – each authors can work on a different chapter concurrently.

* Can ‘publish’ the information in multiple locations and formats

> VitaminDWiki, Conference, Google Scholar, Amazon, and even standard journals (where permitted)

* Can incorporate a wide variety of media

> Audio, video, color, animation, 

* Can attach data which others can use

> Spreadsheets, databases – example through  Google Docs

* Updates can also be attached to the ‘published’ version

## Additional details

* Participants can elect to be informed of changes of anything in VitaminDWiki by e-mail or RSS

* Share/Publish in any language

> Read in any language

* Supports multiple authors

> Only one person can edit a section at a time

> Might want to break a long document (like a book) into sections

* People could perhaps see other groups vitamin D ideas

> Avoid duplication and perhaps join with existing efforts

* Individuals are invited to join a private group in VitaminDWiki

* Vitamin D information packs could be made – somewhat like WikiPedia

> for lay public, medical professionals, insurance companies, employers,

* Variety of groups 

> Researchers, Hospitals, Medical Doctors, Nurses, Senior home staff, pharmacists, 

> Individuals with diseases/medical conditions that benefit from Vitamin D

* Can re-purpose the information

> Conferences, Video, poster sessions, press releases, blog post, 

* Each group can be as stealthy or as visible as they wish

> Each Web page, Forum, Blog Post, comment etc can be public or private (stealthy)

* Hospitals/HMO can use it to share ideas, pamphlets, experiences, etc

* Additional capabilities of the TikiWiki host software 

> Roll-back to previous versions if case of error

> Users can vote on the quality/usefulness of any item (web page, forum, comment, blog post, etc.)

> Item tags can be created by individuals and optionally shared

* Software is is easy to use

> What You See if What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor should be used for most simple pages.

## Possible problems

* No mechanism (yet) for anonymous peer review. 

> Might try peer praise after publication instead of peer review before publication

* If there is lots of use, will have to use a more expensive/powerful server

> Current system can probably serve 100 viewers and 10 authors concurrently.

* Cost of editorial/IT support – so far all done by Henry Lahore 

> Henry does not scale as well as the server.
