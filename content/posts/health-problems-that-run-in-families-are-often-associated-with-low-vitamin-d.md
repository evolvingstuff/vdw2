 **Figure 8 Familial autoimmunity.**  The vertical axis corresponds to the proband’s disease and each disease individually. In the horizontal axis diseases present in first degree relatives are shown. Each color belongs to the proband’s disease. The figure only includes significant results and may serve as a guide for clinical practice in order to search ADs in FDRs of probands.  **Note that familial autoimmune disease is excluded.**
