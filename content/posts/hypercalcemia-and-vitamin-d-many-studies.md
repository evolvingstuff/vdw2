#### Hypercalcemia can be avoided in at least 6 ways

1 )Take less than 750 mg of Calcium

2) Take organic instead of rock Calcium (Calcium Carbonate)

3) Take Magnesium to balance out the excess Calcium

4) Take Vitamin K2 to decrease Calcium in blood and put it into the bones

5) Drink more water

6) Take less Vitamin D - which causes many health problems
