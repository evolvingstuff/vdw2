Irish Acupuncturist and Nutritionist MIchael Cawley reversed 20 years of his MS symptoms with Coimbra Protocol. 

He was then invited to San Paulo, Brazil by Dr.Cicero Coimbra MD (2017) and was added to list of Coimbra Protocol Practioners.

 **Upon clinical application of Coimbra Protocol he made several important discoveries** 

* Many MS patients became worse on high doses of Vitamin D3 that had halted and reversed his own illness.

* In large numbers of MS sufferer’s Vitamin D3 above 500 iu per kg of Vitamin D3 can worsen Multiple Sclerosis symptoms, while 400 - 500 iu per kg of body weight of Vitamin D  can ease symptoms significantly. This worsening of symptoms is misdiagnosed as a multiple sclerosis “flare”, usually adding more D3  makes matters worse.

* He believes that smaller doses (16,000  IU to 18,000 IU) of the properly matched Vitamin D3 and Magnesium supplement can have life-transforming effects on a small number of people, who will only be made worse with higher doses.

* Vitamin D3 brand/form can determine whether Multiple Sclerosis responds to Vitamin D3. Clinical benefit can be determined by the oil the Vitamin D3 is combined with.  He investigated multiple liquid and capsule brands of Vitamin D3 and recommends a select few that work the best.

* Magnesium can make MS symptoms worse when it interacts with toxic heavy metals. He believes that symptoms often misdiagnosed as an MS flare.

* Vitamin B2 can either improve or drastically worsen symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. Worsening of symptoms are also often misdiagnosed as MS flare.

* He had not found the parathyroid Hormone level to be a reliable indicator for success of Vitamin D3.

* Note: He was taken off the list of Coimbra Protocol practitioners in May 2018 (no reason given).

* He advocates Personalized Vitamin D3 method which encourages people to listen to how they feel on different D3 forms/doses, also pioneers use of several forms of D3 used simultaneously.

* He only recommends very specific brands/forms of Vitamin D3, Magnesium, Vitamin B2 , VItamin K2 which have proven themselves with MS cases.

In 18 months no calcium toxicity reported due to lower doses required to gain benefit, early cessation of Vitamin D3 supplementation if ionized calcium or serum calcium exceed highest reference range and use of pharma grade K2. www.menaquingold.com 

* In May 2018 started a Facebook group which has become  [Personalized Vitamin D3 Therapy for MS With Michael Cawley](https://www.facebook.com/groups/629001147449412/)

* Contact email cawleymjd@gmail.com, He does Skype appointments.

#### Cawley Facebook post Sept 2019

* Multiple Sclerosis is a catastrophic neurological illness. No pharmaceutical agent can halt the progression of multiple sclerosis. Multiple studies show Vitamin D3 deficiency to be a major risk factor for Multiple Sclerosis.

* High dose Vitamin D3 therapy for MS, has been pioneered by Dr.Cicero Galli Coimbra MD, www.coimbraprotocol.com

* In 2015, I used high dose Vitamin D3 therapy and the treatment helped reverse nearly 15 years of intractable symptoms. The following year, I was trained in the Coimbra protocol by Cicero Coimbra MD in Brazil.

*  **Over 50% of the MS cases I have worked with notice a worsening of MS symptoms**  on the standard Coimbra Vitamin D3 dose of 1000 iu per kg of body weight. My advice is to never take a dose or form of Vitamin D3 that causes MS symptoms to worsen.

* This group has hundreds of members who have personalized their use of Vitamin D3 magnesium and Vitamin B2 to halt and reverse the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis.

* As heavy metal contamination is so widespread and its symptoms mirror those of Multiple Sclerosis, heavy metal decontamination is a valued aspect of 'Personailzed Vitamin D3' and often achieves life changing results that no vitamin supplement can obtain.

*  **Earthing**  as popularised by Clinton Ober encourages people to harness the healing power of the Earth by harvesting it's rich supply of free electrons. Earthing is clinically proven to strengthen the nervous, endocrine, circulatory and immune systems. Earthing is powerful tool for MS patients.I have enjoyed remarkable health benefits from Earthing and many in this group practice Earthing too.

#### Comments by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki after a video conference with Mike on March 25, 2019

Mike noticed fast reactions by MSers to different forms of Vitamin D

When he had MSers take 20,000 IU of vitamin D, within a day they would either

1) Feel a lot better

2) Feel no difference

3) Feel lots of pain

I have not heard of such fast and strong reactions to Vitamin D before, and suspect not everyone has such strong reactions.  

I suspect much of the difference was in the improved gut-friendliness of vitamin D emulsions, etc.

He also found differences of benefits between suppliers of Vitamin K2-7 and Magnesium

He. like I, had been taking Life Extension Super K, but he found that Menaquin Gold (India) was able to dissolve his artery plaque, whereas Super K did not.  He sent me a bottle.  It appears that form is not on Amazon is out of stock on the web (March 2019).

He, like I, had found Magnesium Chloride to be pretty good.  He also recommends Magceutics Magtein

I mentioned that Ultraviolet light provides MSers with even more benefit than Vitamin D alone. MSers getting the same blood level response from UV and oral vitamin D got [significantly fewer relapses](/posts/multiple-sclerosis-half-as-likely-if-get-plenty-of-sunshine-not-a-news-item).  I suspect there is more than vitamin D is generated in the skin from the sun/UV  

You can make your own [powerful UV lamp from two parts](/posts/vitamin-d-from-low-cost-uvb-lamps) for $40 (Amazon (US)

I have been using that UV lamp ~weekly in the winter since 2012
