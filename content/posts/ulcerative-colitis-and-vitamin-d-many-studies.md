#### Ulcerative Colitis is 1.9 X more likely if low Vitamin D – meta-analysis Oct 2023

 **The correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol . 2023 Oct 18. [doi: 10.1097/MEG.0000000000002670](https://doi.org/10.1097/MEG.0000000000002670) PDF is behind a $47 paywall

Objective: The incidence of UC has increased yearly. Many studies have suggested that patients with ulcerative colitis have abnormal vitamin D levels. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the association between vitamin D levels and ulcerative colitis.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) from inception to December 2022. We included case-control studies comparing the differences in vitamin D levels between patients with ulcerative colitis and healthy populations. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager5.4, Stata17.0 and other software.

Results: Sixteen eligible observational studies were selected from 473 articles involving 2234 subjects, and they included 987 patients with ulcerative colitis and 1247 controls. The results showed that the serum level of vitamin D in patients with ulcerative colitis was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (SMD = -0.83, 95% CI: -1.18, -0.48). Vitamin D deficiency was reported in five studies. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in the ulcerative colitis group than in the healthy control group ( **OR = 1.90** , 95% CI: 1.38, 2.62).

Conclusion: Serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients with ulcerative colitis than in healthy controls.

#### UC reduced by Selenium - RCT July 2023

 **The effect of selenium supplementation on disease activity and immune-inflammatory biomarkers in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial**

Purpose

Selenium (Se) supplementation may help reduce inflammation and disease activity in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. We investigated the therapeutic effects of Se administration in cases with mild-to-moderate active UC.

Methods

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted on 100 cases with active mild-to-moderate UC. The patients were randomly allocated to be given an oral selenomethionine capsule (200 mcg/day, n = 50) or a placebo capsule (n = 50) for 10 weeks. The primary outcome was defined as disease activity via the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI), and secondary outcomes were measured at the end of the study.

Results

After 10 weeks, the SCCAI score's mean was reduced in the Se group (P < 0.001). At the end of the intervention, clinical improvement (decline of 3 ≥ score from baseline score) was observed in 19 patients (38%) of the Se group and 3 patients (6%) of the placebo group. The patients with clinical remission (defined as SCCAI ≤ 2) were assigned in the Se group (P = 0.014). The Se group’s quality of life and Se serum levels were enhanced at the end of the study (P < 0/001). In the Se group, the mean concentration of interleukin-17 decreased (P < 0/001). However, the levels of interleukin-10 showed no considerable change between the two groups in the 10th week (P = 0.23).

Conclusion

Se supplementation as add-on therapy with medical management induced remission and improved the quality of life in patients with active mild-to-moderate UC.
