Phone lines are now open at 602-666-6027. That&rsquo;s 602-666-6027. And we&rsquo;ll be taking your calls from around the world and right here in the USA.</p></li><li><p><span>[music]</span></p></li><li><p>01:15 <strong>Ginney Sanders:</strong> Welcome, welcome everyone to Live with Dr. Carolyn Dean here on this Monday, April 6, 2020. Once again, here on the face of the Earth, so gloriously happy to be alive, to be thriving, to be healthy, knowing that we are surrounded and somewhat overwhelmed with our current predicament of having not sufficient immunity to handle the virus that is circulating now called <strong>COVID-19</strong> . Some of us not having that immunity, but that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here to talk about is how to build that immunity and how to thrive in the midst of this incredible challenge, not just physically through our immune system, but also mentally and also spiritually through the confidence and power that we have in our own health, vitality, and well-being. And of course, we are being upheld and led once again by our very own, Dr. Carolyn Dean, author of &ldquo;The Magnesium Miracle&rdquo; and many other, many other books on natural health, wellness and vitality, having been a leader in the health freedom movement and a advocate for natural health and natural remedies, safe solutions, for many, many years, 50 years.</p></li><li><p>02:28 <strong>GS:</strong> Just&mldr; There&rsquo;s not enough that can be said about Dr. Dean and I hear people hear me say it week after week. For those of you who are new to the show, just finding us through whatever mechanism that you are discovering us this evening, I do want you to know that Dr. Dean is not only a medical doctor, but she&rsquo;s also a naturopath. She&rsquo;s an herbalist, she is a acupuncture, she understands the body in powerful and unique ways. And what she understands more than anything is the body&rsquo;s inherent impulse for life, ladies and gentlemen, life. And by giving the body the basic building blocks, it will construct its own well spring of wellness that will sustain us non-negotiably through all things.</p></li><li><p>03:15 <strong>GS:</strong> So before I bring her on, I just wanna let everybody know this evening we will also be joined by our guest, Carole Baggerly, from GrassrootsHealth. We&rsquo;re excited to have Carole back, she was with us last fall in October, she&rsquo;s got a great update for us. And I will also remind you that Dr. Dean does not give medical advice on her radio show, but what she will do is talk to you about what she would do if she were in your shoes. We will open the phone lines later. Once we do our preamble and our introduction to our guests and talk about our important topics this evening.</p></li><li><p>03:48 <strong>GS:</strong> And you can also avail yourself of our chat line which is at Studio A at achieveradio.com, to type your questions into us. If you are listening to this show through the archive, please also note that you can email your questions to questions, Q-U-E-S-T-I-O-N-S, plural, <a href=mailto:questions@drcarolyndeanlive.com>questions@drcarolyndeanlive.com</a>. And the very dapper, delightful and deliciously wonderful, Melody Rose, will get your questions, she will translate it into an answer and also make Dr. Dean aware and available to answer should you have a question of serious complexity. So without further ado, I shall&mldr; Oh, let me just also say that I want you to be sure to check out our website, rnareset.com for our new product editions, most of which include our back-in-stock RnA drops and also our Mighty Mash, which many people have been asking about. It&rsquo;s on the website for you now, limited quantity, so please avail yourself if you&rsquo;re interested. So without further ado, I shall bring on our very own and most wonderful, Dr. Carolyn Dean.</p></li><li><p><span>[applause]</span></p></li><li><p>05:05 Dr. Carolyn Dean: Thank you, Ginny. Yes, we&rsquo;ve got a jam-packed show. We do have a guest, our very own Carole Baggerly, coming on in a few minutes. But let me start with my preamble as I say every week, hoping that the layering of this onion will get through to people. We want you to refer your practitioner, just email us to ask how you can go about that. We want you to use ReferralCandy so that you can get friends and family on the program, on the protocols, on the complement formulas, because yes, we are and have been building your immunity for years and this is what people require. Get your blood testing done with the home blood test kit and Carole Baggerly will talk about this more when we have her on in a few minutes. Remember our magnesium deficiency survey showing that of over 25,000 people answering. 67 people have anxiety and that is increasing. Insomnia, and that is increasing at 66.2%, muscle cramps 51, heart palpitations 47, restless legs 46%, headaches and migraines 33%.</p></li><li><p>06:32 <strong>DD:</strong> We know people are suffering, people know they are suffering, but we do have answers. These symptoms are of magnesium deficiency until proven otherwise. And you can prove they are magnesium deficiency by taking ReMag. And building your immune D, perfect words by Ginny how to build your immunity. And we&rsquo;ve talked about this, me and Ginny, this is, this <strong>COVID-19</strong> crisis, it&rsquo;s a world wake-up call to learn how to build your immunity, to access natural remedies and take responsibility for your own health. We&rsquo;ve gotten too complacent. The countries that aren&rsquo;t suffering as much, they listen to their government, and they stay healthy.</p></li><li><p>07:29 <strong>DD:</strong> But anyway, Mighty Mash on the shelf, absolutely, totally important for people who are building their gardens now. It&rsquo;s Spring in most of the US and you want your garden now, because if you don&rsquo;t have access to fresh food, then where are you gonna get it? You&rsquo;re gonna get it from your own garden. Mighty Mash is on the shelf and the instructions are on the bag, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to follow. We continue to do the Mighty Mash experiments here on the up country farm and it is quite awesome. We are using the turmeric that our own Houston dug into a turmeric patch, while he was doing the Radish Experiment. He had some extra mash dug it into the turmeric patch and the farmer said he&rsquo;s never had such awesome turmeric. And people were really grabbing on to the turmeric. And in our very last market of last week, we can&rsquo;t do the market anymore, we can&rsquo;t do enough of social distancing. So our farmers doing a lot of home deliveries and box deliveries at the markets.</p></li><li><p>08:45 <strong>DD:</strong> During the show two weeks ago, Ginny and I talked about the homeopathic kits, that homeopathy is very important in these times. If you have any sort of cold or flu snuffle, you can take homeopathic remedies, that&rsquo;s your first line of defense. And then come to find out when Ginny put in the order for more, our representative of the company, his name is Wayne said, &ldquo;Due to the current situation, it may be weeks or months until we can fulfill this order. With such demand for kits, we&rsquo;re having a hard time maintaining our stock levels.&rdquo; So that shows you again, how people are grabbing the natural remedies because there&rsquo;s not that much available medically. Although I do support the use of hydroxychloroquine for people with serious problems with the lung symptoms. Ginny&rsquo;s got a couple of emails from me, with the links to our homeopath that we refer to, Mary Aspinwall on constitutional homeopathic care. You can have a consult with Mary. Mary has a study group on Facebook and a newbie course on homeopathy world.</p></li><li><p>10:12 <strong>DD:</strong> So avail yourself of that information. Now that so many people are sitting at home, we&rsquo;ve got plenty for you to do. Also Ginny will put up a link for their hydrogen peroxide nebulizer information. Last week Thomas Levy, he&rsquo;s a medical doctor and a lawyer, he is not going to give you any sort of false information. So this is important information on using hydrogen peroxide 3% nothing higher in a nebulizer. You may have heard our March 23rd radio show with Robert Scott Bell, and he talked about using silver in a nebulizer. You do not use silver with saline water, you would cut it with distilled water, the salt and the minerals in saline will neutralize the silver. So in lieu of this wake up call and access to natural remedies, one of those natural remedies is vitamin D. We&rsquo;ve tried to support people with their Vitamin D intake using Blue Ice Royal. And we never knew how much vitamin D was in the Blue Ice royal. That&rsquo;s partly why we started this home blood test kit with Carole Baggerly&rsquo;s group. Her group is called GrassrootsHealth and she started doing testing on vitamin D after she discovered with her health condition that she was very low in vitamin D and wanted to make the world aware of the need for vitamin D testing to determine if the level of vitamin D in our blood does that match our clinical symptoms?</p></li><li><p>12:07 <strong>DD:</strong> And when she heard from Dr McCullough that I was a big proponent as you now of magnesium and that magnesium is required for most of the steps that activate vitamin D, we all got together, we&rsquo;re offering this home blood testing kit, with huge, huge discounts and coupons, so that people will get their test. There&rsquo;s been no time that&rsquo;s more important right now to get your testing to know if you are getting the nutrients into your body. Personally my Vitamin D test was very low. Even though I live in Hawaii, I don&rsquo;t go out in the sun a lot, thus my Vitamin D was low so I&rsquo;m taking extra vitamin D, which is very important in these times of the virus. That&rsquo;s why Carol is here so we can discuss Vitamin D and how to increase our levels. So with all that having been said in one breath, I&rsquo;ll get back to Ginny. Ginny&rsquo;s gonna introduce Carol and then we&rsquo;re gonna get on with our program, taking questions from the mail bag, from chat and phone questions as well, over to you Ginny.</p></li><li><p>13:44 <strong>GS:</strong> Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Alright, well ladies and gentlemen we&rsquo;re just so pleased. And of course, the last couple of weeks, we&rsquo;ve just had a whirlwind of special guests on our show, and we&rsquo;re just so glad that Dr. Dean has the resource and the network to be able to do that and to present you once again with more and more compelling information not only for yourselves. We know it&rsquo;s almost sometimes like preaching to the choir, because we know many of our listeners are very astute, but now with 182 different countries under the impact of this, we find that we have a challenge to meet the requirements of educating our brothers and our sisters, and our family members and people who may not have had a ear to hear us before, may have a ear to hear us now.</p></li><li><p>14:30 <strong>GS:</strong> Well when you go to do that, the most important thing you wanna do is have accurate information and you&rsquo;ve heard extremely accurate information on this show for the last couple of weeks. Of course, Dr. Dean&rsquo;s very accurate. But we&rsquo;re talking about big, overwhelming information that we have to present people not only for how to maintain their immune system, but how to respond in the event that they would feel that they would have symptoms and how to respond in the event that they would have symptoms that would be accelerating. We&rsquo;ve discussed it all, and we&rsquo;re gonna continue to discuss it until we get everybody where they need to be. That&rsquo;s Carolyn&rsquo;s commitment, that&rsquo;s mine, and I know for a fact that that is the commitment of our very own and most precious Carole Baggerly GrassrootsHealth who is with us this evening. And Carol, your phone is off mute and you are free to move about the cabin and begin speaking.</p></li><li><p><span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>15:21 **** CB: **** I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;re gonna be able to get everybody where they need to be. Let&rsquo;s see I do believe in an afterlife I think. <span>[laughter]</span> Thank you, Ginny. Thank you Carolyn, I&rsquo;m delighted to be here and it&rsquo;s such a beautiful opportunity. It reminds me of a situation I had in a manufacturing company one time when I was asked to help them implement a new MRP, Material Requirements Planning System and after getting going with it a little bit, I mentioned about the opportunity and the director of materials says, &ldquo;Carol, how can you see this as an opportunity? It&rsquo;s a major problem.&rdquo; So we do have a major problem. And if you&mldr; I have to commend absolutely everybody that&rsquo;s on this call, or that even will listen to it because it means you&rsquo;re already above the curve. You already really need to be complimented for the empowerment that you have used in order to get yourself more healthy, to get more educated, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So thank you. However, what we look at right now is a lot of people, even the well-educated and involved are afraid. And they&rsquo;re afraid of the virus, they&rsquo;re afraid of the impact on themselves, their families, and the financial consequences.</p></li><li><p>16:52 <strong>CB:</strong> Just today, there was a note in the news that the insurance industry was planning to raise their premiums rather significantly. And what this came back to me again which is partly what I want to very much take a few minutes to talk about is the institution we currently live in, mostly around the world with regards to health is broken. It doesn&rsquo;t work. We have all the rewards in the wrong places. The rewards are for using various drugs to prevent a disease which has already occurred. Not to prevent something from happening in the first place. When I was working with a medical office, a couple of years ago, we looked at how to prevent some particular situation and every single one of the prevention capabilities had to do with taking some kind of drug or another. And none of it focused on exercise, none of it focused on attaining healthy weights, none of it focused on any nutrients whatsoever. And there is a lot of experience that I have had with others in recognizing that when the whole reward system is broken, it really is easier, believe it or not, to start anew.</p></li><li><p>18:28 <strong>CB:</strong> And that&rsquo;s really what Dr. Dean has done, it&rsquo;s what GrassrootsHealth has done and we are expanding that by starting anew, we are actually building an infrastructure not just of vitamin D, but of nutrient research and implementation, so that you and everybody can say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rewarding myself with health and feeling good and saving my money, by paying attention to what nutrients that we need in order to be healthy.&rdquo; All of our material that we present on our website, GrassRootsHealth.net have been scientifically based, very much like Carolyn Dean, one of the compliments we get frequently from our users is, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trustworthy.&rdquo; Well, in part, I can&rsquo;t afford not to be. We want you to pay attention to this, as to give you the tools to help really be healthy. So I wanted to indicate a couple of steps here. Why do we have this major vitamin D problem?</p></li><li><p>19:40 <strong>CB:</strong> We have a major vitamin D deficiency, and I will call it an epidemic, all over the world. And the real reason for that is because about 150 years or so years ago, maybe 200 we came in out of the sun. And it has taken a long time for many of the people involved in health to recognize that we lived in the sun from the beginning of the creation of humankind, without it, humans would not have developed. And all of a sudden to pop us in out of the sun in terms of industrialization, in terms of wearing clothes, in terms of saying, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, the sun is bad for you,&rdquo; and scaring people to death, we have inadvertently created a major, major health epidemic for the world. We weren&rsquo;t meant to be inside. When Dr. Hani another D researcher and others reported on a study of vitamin D levels, down in the area of the country or the universe around the equator where people actually still wear very few clothes, where they&rsquo;re still outside a lot. They found that not only were they healthier, but their vitamin D levels, their serum levels, the 25-hydroxy vitamin D, were in the range of somewhere between 40 and 80 nanograms per milliliter or 100 to about 200 nanomoles per litre.</p></li><li><p>21:16 <strong>CB:</strong> Not. Not. Not the current recommendation from the government that we should be at 20 nanograms per milliliter. Every research paper we have published since we started this organization or since that data came out, has shown the increase in the ability to reduce diseases like breast cancer, breast cancer which is where I started. We could reduce it by close to 80%, 80%. With nothing, nothing, nothing more than getting Vitamin D levels from 20 up to about 60 nanograms per milliliter. Our current lack of knowledge in our government about what it takes to be healthy, won&rsquo;t help us be healthy. I really, really, really am still focusing on that. And when we saw for example that we could actually prevent, prevent 40%-60% of preterm birth again with Vitamin D, we went to the FDA to see how we could enable a claim to be put on Vitamin D supplements, that would be able to say it may help you prevent preterm births, we were told that there is a law, a law that requires the FDA to use a dosage in order to make a claim.</p></li><li><p>22:45 <strong>CB:</strong> And as many of you already know, and if you don&rsquo;t know, look on our website, the dose-response for vitamin D varies so much that the appropriate measure of your vitamin D level is not how much you take, it&rsquo;s what you achieve with your serum level. And they wouldn&rsquo;t accept the research showing the reduction in preterm births, because the way we measured it was by the achievement of a serum level. Again, that was heartbreaking to me to see those people so hurt. The other thing that&rsquo;s very significant and I don&rsquo;t know how many of our listeners have dark skin, for one reason or another. There has been a big focus on socioeconomic issues, access to healthcare, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, as a result of dark skin. And again with this population that we had of pregnant women, they were quite a number of people who were dark skinned and once they got their serum levels to the same level as the much lighter skin people, their pre-term birth rate was close to the same.</p></li><li><p>24:03 <strong>CB:</strong> It was not a socio-economic issue, it was a vitamin D sunshine issue. It takes longer in many locations for dark skin to absorb enough vitamin D from the sun. The evolution of getting the darker people to the lighter people took many years, many years. So again, that is the way that we need ultimately to get to. And in the meantime, we have to correct this by doing one thing, which is almost immediate which is taking some kind of supplement of Vitamin D. The second hopefully, we&rsquo;ll get to some day, but we are not ready to do it now is some kind of food fortification or lighting that we can have in our houses or in our offices, to make up for that. With the start of the vitamin D information, it became quite clear that there were many other nutrients, that people were taking and we wanted to see what the interaction was. And as I think I&rsquo;ve mentioned, all health is personal, all of it. I got into D because I had cancer and realized that was a major culprit with why I had breast cancer to start with.</p></li><li><p>25:23 <strong>CB:</strong> My husband had Atrial fibrillation so strong, that we were afraid he was gonna die. And by the way, it was one of the fastest growing monetary clinics in the United States today are A-fib clinics attached to hospitals. And nowhere, nowhere, nowhere in any of those clinics do they recommend the person take magnesium. Fortunately, we found such an educated person right here in San Diego. And she says, &ldquo;Oh, it can be stopped with that.&rdquo; And kind of like the cancer and vitamin D, I said, &ldquo;What? Are you teasing me?&rdquo; And I was scared, I was scared for my husband, for the kind of loss for the damage, etcetera, and we did it and he has not had an A-fib attack since. His magnesium and potassium and hydration, which is also very important were changed. So what we are looking for right this minute is to help expand the world, the message, everything about how these nutrients interact.</p></li><li><p>26:33 <strong>CB:</strong> Due to the fact that we&rsquo;ve done so many more testing things of different nutrients over the last year, we already see scientifically that people who are taking more vitamin C up to about 1000 milligrams a day, can take considerably less vitamin D to achieve a given serum level. That says they interact very, very, very clearly. The same is true with magnesium, the same certainly has been true in the past with magnesium and vitamin K combined. So we&rsquo;re seeing unarguable interactions between these different nutrients that we all need. And at this point in time, we aren&rsquo;t far enough along to say how much of one versus how much of the other brings you the required health outcome, but we know they interact. So the whole idea of nutrient research and how you do it has to change. We can no longer afford the money and the time to look at just Vitamin D. Because it&rsquo;s affected by vitamin C, by magnesium, by Omega 3s, and that balance and that interaction is very important for us to do.</p></li><li><p>27:58 <strong>CB:</strong> The way we see right now going, in order to quickly help people that are in great need is everybody right now knows, everybody that&rsquo;s listening to this, knows you can log on to our website and see what your vitamin D level needs to be. You can enroll in a number of projects that would enable you, everything we do, test vitamin D and Dr. Dean has built a beautiful project, including the magnesium and the Omega-3 and the TSH. And the opportunity to be able to get that out to more people, is what we want to do with the targeted trial and a pilot kind of. Sort of the kind we have with probably more fixed rule and regulations, is to make sure that the groups that we can address, there are a lot of groups that are calling us right now saying, &ldquo;How can you help me?&rdquo; And they are groups that do not have money, their members do not have money, they do not have the resources. So what we are looking for is a way to put this trial in many, many, many communities and areas that can help thousands of people quickly. And so we need sponsors. Very simple. Because we&rsquo;ve already developed the mechanisms to make it happen. The other part of that trial&mldr;</p></li><li><p>29:28 <strong>DD:</strong> Carole. Carole.</p></li><li><p>29:28 <strong>CB:</strong> Yes. Yes. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m just running on so long.</p></li><li><p>29:29 <strong>DD:</strong> Oh, it&rsquo;s wonderful, it&rsquo;s very great ground work here. But yes, tell us more about the trial specifically, is what we&rsquo;re doing with GrassrootsHealth part of the trial?</p></li><li><p>29:44 <strong>CB:</strong> Yes. You definitely are part of the trial. We are not looking at your group explicitly for the occurrence of the <strong>COVID</strong> but we will. We&rsquo;ve already added that to the questionnaire. And the other thing that will be part of the trial will be the test of much higher intake levels. That once we get the trial up and going, which literally will be just a few weeks, the IRB thing that has to approve what we do will say is, &ldquo;Fine do it so forth and so on.&rdquo; So but basically&mldr;</p></li><li><p>30:24 <strong>DD:</strong> Right. The IRB is the <strong>Institutional Review Board</strong> . So.</p></li><li><p>30:29 <strong>CB:</strong> Yes.</p></li><li><p>30:30 <strong>DD:</strong> We committed, my company, <strong>New Capstone</strong> committed a year, two years ago actually, to do university research. And that does drag on and when Carole says &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to do this and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be a couple of weeks.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like music to our ears. <span>[chuckle]</span> It&rsquo;s so wonderful. And Carol when she started and correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, you started with the measurement of vitamin D and after that did you add the omega-3 fatty acids?</p></li><li><p>31:05 <strong>CB:</strong> Yes. Yes. Yes.</p></li><li><p>31:06 <strong>DD:</strong> And then what <span>[31:07]</span> **** .</p></li><li><p>31:08 <strong>CB:</strong> We did because&mldr;</p></li><li><p>31:09 <strong>DD:</strong> Go ahead.</p></li><li><p>31:09 <strong>CB:</strong> Go ahead. That&rsquo;s fine.</p></li><li><p>31:12 <strong>DD:</strong> We added the magnesium, when we came on board GrassrootsHealth added magnesium, and then we asked to add the TSH because we were finding with the ReMag the ReMyte that people&rsquo;s thyroid was improving, were improving. And what more are you adding now?</p></li><li><p>31:36 <strong>CB:</strong> The biggest thing that we are adding right now with this new trial would be much higher recommendations for intake. Because there was recently and there have been over the years, published papers showing that, one that we just published or sent out last, about two weeks ago from Patrick McCullough showing that intake of 10,000, 50,000 IU a day for long periods of time is perfectly safe. So we can tell people that, which is still our method, which is scientifically people can be told that this is safe. And if you&rsquo;re not getting where you want to get so forth and so on. But within the study we actually want to break the study into groups of people who are interested in taking that 50,000 IU a day as well as we will be testing the core nutrients, such as magnesium and vitamin C, we will be adding. We haven&rsquo;t been testing that before we know people take it, but those are a couple of biggies.</p></li><li><p>32:25 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay. So let&rsquo;s get right to our first question. Charlie wrote in and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a lot about vitamin D supplementation and toxicity causing heart palpitations. I&rsquo;ve also experienced this first-hand. My question is, is this only because it lowers your body&rsquo;s magnesium or is it more involved than that?&rdquo; And he goes on to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a healthy male, I work outside, but whenever I get a blood test my vitamin D is low, I&rsquo;d like to get this number up, but every time I supplement, it gives me palpitations. I&rsquo;ve been taking magnesium for a few months and have seen many benefits, but by Vitamin D3 still doesn&rsquo;t work well for me.&rdquo; So this is the, kind of the sub-group that I&rsquo;ve encountered, Carole, where I learned about the absolute requirement for magnesium in people who are taking any vitamin D. Even we have people who say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lie in the sun, and I&rsquo;ll get a heart palpitation, if I don&rsquo;t take my magnesium.&rdquo; So you&rsquo;ve got your personal experience with your husband, I&rsquo;m sure he was on a lot of vitamin D, he had the heart palpitations, took the magnesium. So what can we tell Charlie about his experience?</p></li><li><p>34:16 <strong>CB:</strong> First of all, I have to be very honest with you and say I am not a doctor, best I am is a scientist and we do lots of research. The heart palpitations is not a thing that we have heard from our cohort. We have had people who have had digestive issues, or whatever based more on the supplement that they are taking than anything else but not directly associated as far as we could see with Vitamin D intake. They are related however as we see and as Dr. Dean, I know that you know more in depth from your experience than I do. But I would suggest that Charlie work with a naturopath or someone to help investigate what&rsquo;s going on because it&rsquo;s certainly not a common situation with vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>35:14 <strong>DD:</strong> So because we stand out with our magnesium deficiency, then perhaps we&rsquo;re attracting a lot of people with magnesium deficiency, and they&rsquo;re just not able to convert their vitamin D. What I&rsquo;d say to Charlie obviously is, &ldquo;Are you taking ReMag? How much are you taking? And if you take more will that make it easier for you to metabolize your vitamin D and not pull it away from your heart?&rdquo; &lsquo;Cause that&rsquo;s what seems to be happening, that&rsquo;s the first thing to investigate is how saturated are you with Vitamin D. And again the testing that&rsquo;s done with GrassrootsHealth is whole blood magnesium tests which seems to be, well it&rsquo;s much better than serum magnesium, it&rsquo;s even better than RBC magnesium, because 90% of the magnesium in a cell is in the mitochondria and there are no mitochondria in red blood cells. So it&rsquo;s really not the best, the next best choice and our research with, the University research we&rsquo;re doing is to show people that the ionized magnesium testing is far superior.</p></li><li><p>36:41 <strong>DD:</strong> So we&rsquo;re all trying to figure this out. And as Carole has said, and will continue to say, we&rsquo;re the only ones doing it. The pharmaceutical companies aren&rsquo;t gonna test for nutrients, the government is not gonna test for nutrients. When you talk to the NIH, the Office of dietary supplements, they&rsquo;re mainly looking at nutrients to make sure you don&rsquo;t have a deficiency. So that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ll say their vitamin C, RDA, Recommended Dietary Allowance is 60 milligrams. 60 milligrams. And when you ask someone, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you test for what&rsquo;s gonna keep people healthy?&rdquo; And they say, &ldquo;No, no, no, that&rsquo;s not our mandate.&rdquo; So they turn their back on doing any research that&rsquo;s going to help people stay healthy. So seriously, GrassrootsHealth is the only thing I&rsquo;ve come across in these many decades, that is going to help us find out clinically what&rsquo;s going on with your body. And Carole, I want you to tell us now, both the other part of, there&rsquo;s a blood test, it&rsquo;s just a finger prick, you drop your blood on a piece of cardboard for Pete&rsquo;s sake and send it in. But then there&rsquo;s the questionnaires. Tell us about the questionnaires.</p></li><li><p>38:15 <strong>CB:</strong> Yeah. The questionnaires that people respond to. I also, for all of those that are listening that are already participating thank you so much for taking the time to fill these in. And sometimes they may seem a little bit long, but it&rsquo;s based on your data about what&rsquo;s going on with your health that allows us to create the scientific report saying, it depends on this, it depends on that. So first of all, a big thank you. But the questionnaire is based on what we put together with the researchers, the scientific people in the fields of nutrients to say, &ldquo;What do we need to know about these people?&rdquo; And some of the information is very basic. Like, how old are you and what sex are you and how much do you weigh, what, where do you live latitude-wise?"</p></li><li><p>39:13 <strong>CB:</strong> So you fill in all of those questions and you also fill in the specifics about the supplements of any kind that you are taking. And by specifics, we actually have to know the brand&rsquo;s name and the compound, like some brands&mldr; Brand X might have three different compounds of Vitamin D that they use for example. And we have to know which one you&rsquo;re using because they have different ways of interacting in your body and they have different ways of calculating the information about how much you are getting. And the other part we have developed a dose response mechanism. Back again to the magnesium as I&rsquo;m sure all of you know, there are so many different magnesium compounds.</p></li><li><p>40:07 <strong>CB:</strong> Not the product names per se, that there&rsquo;s certainly what Dr. Dean has with her magnesium chloride, which is a liquid. Some people have tablets, some people have this, that or another, they&rsquo;re made, somewhere in them they have magnesium. But they have other substances as well. And what we&rsquo;re already finding is that they work quite differently with people. You have to take more of this one versus less of that one. And we&rsquo;re also asking all of you that are participating specifically with the magnesium is to do some interim or short-term tracking that we&rsquo;ve built a special module there to say, &ldquo;What are&mldr; How are things going today?&rdquo; Because as somewhat unique, although Vitamin D has many things that happen really fast, it goes for pain relief literally within weeks if not faster.</p></li><li><p>41:01 <strong>CB:</strong> Magnesium has many actions that you as individuals can sense the symptoms of certainly pain in the legs and certainly insomnia and anxiety can go away very quickly. And whereas most of the questionnaire things we do every six months, we don&rsquo;t wanna lose that piece of information. So but you fill out the questionnaire and then you hit the button that says, &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo; And then you send in the test kit which we then make sure it fits with what we need to have in it, and then we forward that to the labs that we work with, and they send us back the results and we send those to you just as quickly as we can. So sometimes it&rsquo;s a little hard to get started but then it goes very smoothly.</p></li><li><p>41:57 <strong>DD:</strong> Right. And this is very important. I think the whole questioning of consumers and patients and customers, it&rsquo;s a lost art. I know with a doctor having a seven-minute appointment, they&rsquo;re not even going to ask you more than one or two questions because they&rsquo;re not gonna get paid for&mldr; There&rsquo;s so much horror in the current medical model. When I was in practice, I would have hour long appointments and really find out what was going on. So this is what these questionnaires are about, they&rsquo;re uncovering what&rsquo;s really going on with the person and now with computer algorithms, it is amazing what information we can put together, the conclusions we can draw from this.</p></li><li><p>42:56 <strong>DD:</strong> And having an IRB, an Institutional Review Board, having the doctors and scientists on board, that Carole has accumulated. These papers are gonna be published. They&rsquo;re gonna be scientific papers and like she already mentioned about these pre-term births, trying to prevent them, she&rsquo;ll do all this work and then go to government and say, &ldquo;Hey look, isn&rsquo;t this amazing? Let&rsquo;s do something about it.&rdquo; And they say, &ldquo;Oh sorry, we&rsquo;re, this is our little box, this is, our blinkers go to here and we&rsquo;re not gonna be able to help you change any policies.&rdquo; So that means, again, and again, and again, we are on our own. But with a organization like GrassrootsHealth then we can be assured that we&rsquo;re gonna get the information that we need to make the right choices. So I&rsquo;m going to&mldr;</p></li><li><p>43:58 <strong>CB:</strong> The other part that I&mldr; Excuse me. Go ahead.</p></li><li><p>44:02 <strong>DD:</strong> I was just gonna get Ginny in on this to see if we had questions, but you finish up Carol. Please.</p></li><li><p>44:08 <strong>CB:</strong> Okay, I have one other thing I really want to highlight. One of the things that we talk about, or we hear about on the radio or whatever, a lot of times is personalized medicine. Not health, but medicine. And you look at what the current systems that are offered by the medical groups look like and they are not about you, they are about them and they are sending out you medical data. And one of the things that we have built is a system which is meant to be used by all users with scientific information and we&rsquo;ve already gotten lots of compliments on.</p></li><li><p>44:53 <strong>CB:</strong> Certainly you can show me my results, but you show me my results is the function of what I&rsquo;ve been doing, but we also present data to the user. Every single user is saying, &ldquo;Here is&mldr; " Let&rsquo;s make pain because that&rsquo;s such a common thing. Here are the pain ratings of a group of 10,000 people based on their responses and based on how much Vitamin D they&rsquo;re taking. And we plot, we stick a little blue button right where your result is and your pain level is and then that enables the individual to say, &ldquo;Hmm looks like if I take more Vitamin D, it might reduce my pain a lot.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;It looks like I&rsquo;m already at the level where it&rsquo;s probably as good as I&rsquo;m gonna get because I can see thousands of other people really right there.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>45:45 <strong>CB:</strong> So that personalized self, really is a matter of being able to take information that&rsquo;s based on other people doing things like you are doing and you&rsquo;re being able to see it, analyze and presented directly to you. The thing we&rsquo;d like to see in the future is that the medical profession or whoever, your&mldr; I will call them a partner right now, not a doctor even. I don&rsquo;t&mldr; I&rsquo;m getting hung up on the word sometime, forgive me, but I really want consultants out there for individuals to say, &ldquo;The individual can print out one of these reports.&rdquo; They can take it to their consultant or whatever and say, &ldquo;This is what&rsquo;s happening. I need a little bit of personal one-on-one advice because you know more about X than I do.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where we see this going. That&rsquo;s what personalized health means to me personally.</p></li><li><p>46:46 <strong>DD:</strong> Very good. Very good. Okay, Ginny, what&rsquo;s going on on chat or on the phone lines?</p></li><li><p>46:53 <strong>GS:</strong> Excellent. 602-6666-227 is the phone number to call this evening if you do have a question for Dr. Dean or Carol about tonight&rsquo;s topic and things that apply to you personally. I want to give you a chance if you&rsquo;re on the line right now, &lsquo;cause I see a lot of new callers. You&rsquo;ve gotta hit star five on your keypad, star five to raise your hand in the studio, and that will give&mldr; Let me know you&rsquo;re on the phone, and then I can put you on so we can fit you in here during the course of the show. Now, the other thing is we&rsquo;ve got a couple of questions here Carolyn about Vitamin D in general, people are always interested in how to interact Carol, with the sun. What is your view on suntan lotion and what do you think about the sad lamps or sun tanning in a tanning booth to boost Vitamin D. And I know those are all kind of just a melee of questions, but they&rsquo;re kind of cobbled together. Can you address those?</p></li><li><p>47:58 <strong>CB:</strong> I would love to. Thank you for asking. First of all, looking to the future, ever so slightly, May is our Sunshine month. So we will be putting out a whole bunch of newsletters and specific information on the value of the sun for your health. I&rsquo;m a total believer kind of like I started with, which is we were meant to use the sun. The biggest negative is that you don&rsquo;t wanna burn. Period. That&rsquo;s it. It creates more than Vitamin D in your body and we don&rsquo;t even know yet all the things it does. There was a presentation by Dr. Weller most recent&mldr; Or not recently, really some years ago, saying that being out in the sun creates nitric oxide in your body which helps reduce the risk of heart attacks.</p></li><li><p>48:53 <strong>CB:</strong> Nitric oxide isn&rsquo;t even an outfit of Vitamin D. It&rsquo;s from the sunshine&rsquo;s interaction with your body, and we need it. We desperately need it. So we have to take advantage of the opportunity to get it. And the other thing to be informed about is the current medical profession or whatever says, &ldquo;Oh yeah, make sure you&rsquo;re in the morning or the evening.&rdquo; Well, facts are that the UVB rays from the sun aren&rsquo;t even available to you no matter what latitudes you&rsquo;re at except kind of between 10:00 and 2:00, which is when you&rsquo;re told to stay out. There&rsquo;s a lot of misinformation out there about the sunshine.</p></li><li><p>49:38 <strong>CB:</strong> So, I think you should get it when you can but 10:00 to 2:00 is the prime time to get something that happens. Be aware that the older you get your skin becomes less able to create the Vitamin D for your body in your skin because it has, in one sense less fatty tissue, so you may still need to take a supplement. And we have a number of people in our projects that use tanning booths and they&rsquo;re perfectly fine. But one of the interesting things there is they use them regularly, except in the winter they have to boost their Vitamin D with some kind of supplement because they don&rsquo;t have time to do that kind of tanning, so forth and so on.</p></li><li><p>50:18 <strong>CB:</strong> I am pretty negative about sunscreen because all of sunscreens have chemicals in them which&mldr; Almost all of them, not all, are not good for your body, and mostly people do not put on enough to really help prevent anyway. And what they end up with <span>[chuckle]</span> unfortunately is a sunburn because they think they&rsquo;ve been protected from the sun when as a matter of fact they haven&rsquo;t. So, basically get what you can. We published a paper after a beautiful seminar we did, a continuing education seminar a couple of years ago. Dr. Alexander Wunsch flew over from Germany to talk about the treatment of health with light, not sunshine but light, different light and wavelengths, what they can do for this, this, this, and this. It was a beautiful presentation, and he knows an awful lot about what the whole light spectrum of the sun can do for you. Take a look at that and we will highlight that again in May.</p></li><li><p>51:35 <strong>GS:</strong> Okay, wonderful. Excellent. Excellent responses. Let&rsquo;s just say five minutes to the top of the hour. Carole, you&rsquo;ll be with us into the next hour, correct?</p></li><li><p>51:45 <strong>CB:</strong> I cannot give up the opportunity. Thank you so much. <span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>51:49 <strong>GS:</strong> Okay, very good. Excellent. Alright wonderful. So we&rsquo;ll pull over into the next hour. Now, our guest is asking, &ldquo;I take all the complement formulas. I&rsquo;m 64, I do not take additional Vitamin D. What is the recommended dosage?&rdquo; Carole, you wanna take that?</p></li><li><p>52:11 <strong>CB:</strong> Sure. We get asked it all the time. I have to respond with I don&rsquo;t know. It depends if you take any Vitamin D&mldr; I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hear clearly Ginny if you&mldr; Has she taken any Vitamin D at all?</p></li><li><p>52:26 <strong>GS:</strong> She does not take additional Vitamin D. None.</p></li><li><p>52:29 <strong>CB:</strong> Does she know what her serum level is?</p></li><li><p>52:34 <strong>GS:</strong> I would imagine not &lsquo;cause she says that Medicare does not pay for Vitamin D screening.</p></li><li><p>52:40 <strong>CB:</strong> Okay, okay. Again, on our website, you can take a look at a chart we have out there which shows that in order to get up to that minimum of about 40 nanograms per milliliter, which really is a minimum which the scientists on our panel, 48 of them worldwide have agreed is&mldr; It would take about 5,000 international units a day for about 50% of the population to get there, alright? If you wanna go for 80% or 90% of the population, that&rsquo;s also on the chart and that&rsquo;s gonna take closer to 8,000-10,000 international units a day. So somewhere in that range is what we have seen as being a result of intake and the only way to know if it&rsquo;s right for you really is to measure, however both of those numbers, the 10,000 IU a day is considered by the Institute of Medicine, we know observable adverse event level. And we have lots of people in our project taking that as well as lots of people taking 50,000, so that&rsquo;s the beginning.</p></li><li><p>54:02 <strong>DD:</strong> And what you&rsquo;ve already mentioned is that people who take extra Vitamin C might need less, people who take magnesium might need less to achieve the 40 nanograms.</p></li><li><p>54:17 <strong>CB:</strong> Exactly, exactly, exactly.</p></li><li><p>54:19 <strong>DD:</strong> So this is what we&rsquo;re trying to find out and it&rsquo;s not being done by any other institution or any other body. We are the experiment.</p></li><li><p><span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>54:34 <strong>CB:</strong> We&rsquo;re also more healthy than most. If you look at some of our published papers to be able to say that, you know, those who are at this level had a considerably lower occurrence of some disease. So we&rsquo;re delighted.</p></li><li><p>54:47 <strong>DD:</strong> Right. And let me just say in the last minute before the top of the hour, go to grassrootshealth.com and the get the news&mldr;</p></li><li><p>55:00 <strong>CB:</strong> Dot net.</p></li><li><p>55:01 <strong>DD:</strong> Grassrootshealth.net. And how do people get your newsletter, which is quite wonderful?</p></li><li><p>55:09 <strong>DD:</strong> They need to authorize us to send it to them at this point in time. If you kind of go down to the bottom of the home page, there&rsquo;s a little box you can click that sign up for the news, and you enter your email. And go from there.</p></li><li><p>55:25 <strong>DD:</strong> Perfect. Okay, we&rsquo;re at the top of the hour, we&rsquo;ll be back in&mldr; What did you say Ginny? It&rsquo;s only a 90-second break, so off you go.</p></li><li><p><span>[music]</span></p></li><li><p>55:38 S?: We&rsquo;ll be back with hour two of the Dr. Carolyn Dean live radio show.</p></li><li><p>55:44 S?: Along with host Ginny Sanders, right after these brief station breaks.</p></li><li><p>55:54 S?: You can also get updates and resources online by visiting drcarolyndean.com.</p></li><li><p><span>[music]</span></p></li><li><p>56:14 S?: Psychic radio, holistic radio, spiritual radio, this is achieveradio.com.

Hour two, Dr. Carolyn Dean Live here this Monday, April 6, 2020, and we&rsquo;re so glad to have you along. Those who&rsquo;ve listened through the archives, if you&rsquo;re inspired by what you&rsquo;re hearing and would like to participate in our GrassrootsHealth project, knowing that, yes, it&rsquo;s research, but first and foremost, the thing that&rsquo;s most important about it is that you&rsquo;re going to get your own metric. You&rsquo;re going to have an&mldr; I&rsquo;ll tell you, the staff is fantastic that works with GrassrootsHealth, and of course, our customer service team is fantastic.</p></li><li><p>01:17 <strong>GS:</strong> You&rsquo;re gonna buy the kit which is on our website, rnareset.com, you can go to the page that says &ldquo;research&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re gonna learn all about it, you&rsquo;re gonna buy the kit. You are going to get $214 worth of discount on our products that match the things that we&rsquo;re evaluating for, which is your magnesium level, your TSH, your vitamin D, your omega acids, fatty acids which is fantastic.</p></li><li><p>01:46 <strong>GS:</strong> So you&rsquo;re gonna have your own health metric. You&rsquo;re gonna get trackers that you can answer on a regular basis, they&rsquo;re more simple than the big questionnaire going into the gate, that is gonna help you track your symptoms. We see this all the time. People, they get on our products, and they come on for one thing like, &ldquo;I have high blood pressure.&rdquo; And then the next thing you know, they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m sleeping better, and my skin is cleared up, and my hair is thicker, but my blood pressure is still so high.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Well, your body&rsquo;s responding to what&rsquo;s happening, and if you keep track of your improvements, pretty soon you&rsquo;re gonna expect an overall improvement and that improvement is gonna happen.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>02:28 <strong>GS:</strong> In addition to that, you&rsquo;re gonna get tons of support from their staff, our staff, and you&rsquo;re gonna have these incredible things. Now, as it was mentioned earlier, yes, that&rsquo;s right, doctors don&rsquo;t&mldr; Medicare and things like that, they don&rsquo;t pay for vitamin D screening. But here, let me just say it for everybody who&rsquo;s missed the recent bulletin, &ldquo;Welcome to a new planet.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re on a new planet, people. Okay, everybody pay attention to what&rsquo;s happening. Institutions have collapsed, the medical community isn&rsquo;t what everybody thought it was. You are in charge of your health now, like it or not.</p></li><li><p>03:09 <strong>GS:</strong> Participate in the program, Dr. Dean graciously giving you an equal&mldr; And by the way, I&rsquo;m just gonna get Carolyn to second this and say, &ldquo;No other sponsor is doing this.&rdquo; No other sponsor is practically paying for your testing by giving you all these product coupons so you can afford to actually do the program and then be responsible for your health, which I know a lot of people here are on there. That&rsquo;s the great thing about what we&rsquo;re offering. It&rsquo;s incredible what you can do participating, and the support that you&rsquo;re gonna get by participating in this.</p></li><li><p>03:49 <strong>GS:</strong> Okay, now, welcome back to Carole Baggerly, GrassrootsHealth, welcome back to Dr. Carolyn Dean.</p></li><li><p>03:56 Speaker 3: Hey, Ginney, I wanna complete the story. When Carolyn was talking about in her early years of practice that she would see a patient for an hour, and she was only supposed to do for seven minutes, she was called in, this is in 1984, by the authorities and disciplined for spending an hour with a patient.</p></li><li><p><span>[chuckle]</span></p></li><li><p>04:19 S3: She was ruining the&mldr; It&rsquo;s like real estate. You sell your house for a lower&mldr; The other neighbors get mad, you&rsquo;ve lowered the fee. She was put&mldr; Because she physically was doing an hour with each patient, it ruined&mldr; Ruined what, Carolyn, ruined the profile?</p></li><li><p><span>[chuckle]</span></p></li><li><p>04:36 Carolyn Dean: Yeah. Okay, yeah, there&rsquo;s a couple of things there, yes. I informed them&mldr; When I started to go in practice, I guess naively I just said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be doing counseling to keep people healthy. What are the codes I can use, how much time can I spend?&rdquo; So they told me and then about six months later investigated me, because I was spending too much time with my patients. And then the other shoe dropped when the Revenue Canada investigated me for being a low-income doctor. They thought I must be hiding something, &lsquo;cause I was reporting a low income, but I had a full practice.</p></li><li><p>05:22 <strong>DD:</strong> So, yeah, they get you coming and going, because you&rsquo;re not fitting into the general zeitgeist, and this is what Carole has dug herself out of having the horror of being diagnosed with breast cancer and being told, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do but this surgery, and this drug, and this chemical.&rdquo; And how did you find out about vitamin D in your search right at the beginning?</p></li><li><p><span>[chuckle]</span></p></li><li><p>05:52 <strong>CB:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t find out right at the beginning.</p></li><li><p>05:55 <strong>DD:</strong> Yeah.</p></li><li><p>05:56 <strong>CB:</strong> After I had the treatment using <span>[06:00]</span> **** and had seen what damage it did to me, the treatment. And I read a lot, I&rsquo;m a science person by nature, and I could see that the treatment itself had long-lasting effects. I currently have permanent damage to my lungs and my heart as a result of the chemo and the radiation that I got. So it&rsquo;s like, I could see that.</p></li><li><p>06:23 <strong>CB:</strong> And my motto with starting new things, and I&rsquo;ve started a number of new organizations, has always been, there&rsquo;s gotta be a better way. And I didn&rsquo;t know what it was. I truly did not know what it was. And two years after having had the breast cancer, I was still researching all day, every day, to see what&rsquo;s out there. And one of my sons at the time was a very un-endowed staff person at MD Anderson as a biostatistician. And he made the beautiful statement to me one time, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good enough.&rdquo; So two years, 2007, I went and had a normal kind of ordinary routine physical and my doctor at that time told me I was low in vitamin D. She actually measured it. How about that? And I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; And she says, &ldquo;Well, you have osteomalacia.&rdquo; And she says that&rsquo;s connected with that. And that surprised me somewhat &lsquo;cause I exercised then, I exercise now. And I&rsquo;m reasonable weight, so forth and so on.</p></li><li><p>07:37 <strong>CB:</strong> But anyway, I went home. I went back to research and then&mldr; I still apologize this very day. It took me two more hours before I keyed in&mldr; Google was still around those days. I keyed in vitamin D and cancer. And up came a publication of a paper that Dr. Cedric Garland, right here in San Diego, had just published showing that with a vitamin D serum level of about 16 anagrams per milliliter you could prevent 50% of breast cancer. And I sat there and I looked at it and I said, &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo; And I started to shake and whatever and I called up a friend. I know a lot of university people, and I said, &ldquo;Is this guy a flake?&rdquo; And <span>[chuckle]</span> she&rsquo;s said, &ldquo;Carole, he&rsquo;s not only not a flake, he&rsquo;s been doing this for 20 years, and he&rsquo;s been discouraged because he thinks nobody is listening.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>08:40 <strong>CB:</strong> So then started the whole excursion of meeting with the researchers and there was a beautiful trial at the National Cancer Institute in March that Dr. Tony Norman one of the starters of the whole vitamin D research invited me to. And I went and there were several days of listening to beautiful research about vitamin D and cancer, some of it in test tubes, some of it with people, some of it whatever. And I cannot say it was all exciting. But it was all, &ldquo;Oh, my gosh. This has tremendous opportunities with it.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>09:18 <strong>CB:</strong> And then at the very end Dr. John Milner, a very delightful person who was leading the research group, said, &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; And this was 2007 and I was totally unfamiliar with what came next was, &ldquo;We need to do more research.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>09:38 <strong>CB:</strong> And I</p></li><li><p><span>[09:39]</span> **** . I just pressed my speaker button and I stood up and I said, &ldquo;Where is your sense of urgency?&rdquo; And I sat down. I was ready to give up. And then the most phenomenal thing in the world happened. And this is the blessing I have of with working with all these researchers now. The meeting was over. And all of a sudden I had a line, a line of vitamin D researchers standing with me saying, &ldquo;How can you help us?&rdquo; The researchers care. They know it and they need help this day in getting the word out in all fields and it&rsquo;s not vitamin D. It&rsquo;s everything. So we were delighted to do that.</p></li><li><p>10:24 <strong>DD:</strong> Oh, boy. Amazing. And let me clear something up. When you said vitamin D was low and your doctor said you had some form of osteo, which osteo was it?</p></li><li><p>10:36 <strong>CB:</strong> She said osteomalacia which would be the beginning of osteoporosis as I understand it.</p></li><li><p>10:42 <strong>DD:</strong> No, malacia is different. Do you think she said&mldr;</p></li><li><p>10:45 <strong>CB:</strong> Oh osteopenia.</p></li><li><p>10:46 <strong>DD:</strong> Osteopenia? Penia.</p></li><li><p>10:47 <strong>CB:</strong> That&rsquo;s what she said. That&rsquo;s what she said. Thank you. Thank you.</p></li><li><p>10:51 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay, good. Just clear that. And you gave the date of that NIH Cancer Institute. So then what date did you begin grassrootshealth.net?</p></li><li><p><span>[chuckle]</span></p></li><li><p>11:04 <strong>CB:</strong> About a week later.</p></li><li><p>11:06 <strong>DD:</strong> See. <span>[laughter]</span> See Ginney? See Ginney? That&rsquo;s so cool. Good for you. Okay.</p></li><li><p>11:13 <strong>CB:</strong> I had several other businesses, so I knew how to go about that part. <span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>11:18 <strong>DD:</strong> Wow. Ginney any questions, and then&mldr;</p></li><li><p>11:22 <strong>GS:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p></li><li><p>11:23 <strong>DD:</strong> You can take over? Go ahead <span>[chuckle]</span></p></li><li><p>11:24 <strong>GS:</strong> Questions and phone calls. No, that&rsquo;s great Carole. Thank you so much for sharing that. That&rsquo;s wonderful. Okay. Now we&rsquo;ve got a couple of people asking for a recommendation on vitamin D. What brand to take and this and that. We&rsquo;re gonna get to that in a minute, so just hold on to that. We will get to that. I&rsquo;ve got a couple of questions here I wanna do before we miss and then we&rsquo;re gonna go to our phone calls as well. One question, &ldquo;Is vitamin D necessary for weight loss? And does a lack of vitamin D contribute with weight gain?&rdquo; Carole? Carolyn? Either one.</p></li><li><p>11:56 <strong>CB:</strong> I here you. I don&rsquo;t currently have any information that validates that. I think the weight issue is much more complex than just vitamin D. As many people who tried it know it&rsquo;s the diet that you eat. It&rsquo;s certainly sometimes the genetics and so forth, and so on. So there&rsquo;s no immediate feeling like you don&rsquo;t need to eat so much or whatever the reason is there. So unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t address that. I would like to&mldr;</p></li><li><p>12:34 <strong>DD:</strong> But that would&mldr; That could be something that would come up in the research, wouldn&rsquo;t it? If people&mldr;</p></li><li><p>12:40 <strong>CB:</strong> Right. Right. Exactly, &lsquo;cause we haven&rsquo;t seen any major things there.</p></li><li><p>12:45 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay.</p></li><li><p>12:46 <strong>CB:</strong> We are putting modules together for a ketogenic diet though because a coaching group wants to have that. So we will be doing that as well. I do have one comment I&rsquo;d like to make though on&mldr; We read a lot on the web and whatever that you can get vitamin D from your food, etcetera. I would like to respond to that if I may. In currently food substances, the biggest source of vitamin D probably is fatty fish and like salmon or something like that. And the most it has in it per serving is somewhere between 400 and 500 international units per serving, and I have just told you that you need at least 5000 IU a day. That means you&rsquo;d have to have 10 servings of salmon a day. So our food development over the years has not&mldr; Except if you wanna go to whale blubber, okay? If you wanna do that, you can actually get toxic. <span>[laughter]</span> But do not look to food for a main source of vitamin D right now, because our food is not fortified well enough to do that.</p></li><li><p>14:05 <strong>DD:</strong> What about cod liver oil? I&rsquo;m in the generation that grew up with a teaspoon of cod liver oil every morning.</p></li><li><p>14:14 <strong>CB:</strong> And if they have measured how much vitamin D is in it, that&rsquo;s good, and take a look at what it says on the bottle. It doesn&rsquo;t automatically have vitamin D in it anymore.</p></li><li><p>14:26 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay. Back to you, Ginney.</p></li><li><p>14:31 <strong>GS:</strong> Excellent. Excellent, okay let&rsquo;s do this. Let&rsquo;s take a couple phone calls. Let&rsquo;s go out to area code 732. 732, you&rsquo;re on the line with Dr. Carolyn Dean and Carole Baggerly, GrassrootsHealth. If you could give us your name and then state your question or comment.</p></li><li><p>14:48 Diana: Hi, my name is Diana. It&rsquo;s so nice to speak with you again. I have two questions actually. One is for Carole, and I wanted to ask&mldr; The other question is for Dr. Dean. My first question is, I was&mldr; I had myself tested twice in 2019 and my vitamin D 25-hydroxy levels were at 67ng in September 2019, which was reduced from 135ng, and my doctors were very scared because they thought I was toxic. So my doctor at the time told me, &ldquo;Do not take any more vitamin D. We need your levels to come down to 30 or 40ngs.&rdquo; But then he also said, &ldquo;Once we get the levels down, I want you to supplement with a Blue Bonnet Liquid Calcium Magnesium Citrate.&rdquo; Now I haven&rsquo;t started doing that &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve been taking all of Dr. Dean&rsquo;s supplements, but I&rsquo;m wondering, should I actually be retested and then follow the doctors protocol or what would you suggest Carole?</p></li><li><p>16:00 <strong>CB:</strong> What we have presented is, again on our website, our recommendation of a group of vitamin D very experienced researchers who are both MDs and biological researchers that say the level that we see based on health outcomes is between 40 and 60 nanograms per milliliter, and that&rsquo;s what that recommendation is based on. It is safe. Different conditions really do require different serum levels, so that&rsquo;s why many people very simply refer or go for the highest one.</p></li><li><p>16:39 Diana: Okay.</p></li><li><p>16:39 <strong>CB:</strong> And 30, back again to why there&rsquo;s a cut off at 40, if you take a look at the data we have, even on pre-term births there is such a beautiful curve that shows the number of weeks gestation, the higher the vitamin D level just goes up and up and up until it gets to 40 and then it&rsquo;s essentially plateaus. After that, more than 40 doesn&rsquo;t really buy you anything for pre-term birth. On the other hand, we have demonstrated with our research, as well as our CT research on breast cancer, that getting up to 60 nanograms per milliliter greatly helps reduce the cancer. So anyway, I would not ever go less than that myself.</p></li><li><p>17:33 Diana: Okay, so I think the reason why&mldr; I have osteoporosis and my numbers were really, really low, so they wanted to put me on Prolia, but I&rsquo;m trying to do it all without Prolia, because I don&rsquo;t wanna be on an injection for the rest of my life.</p></li><li><p>17:48 <strong>CB:</strong> So I think that&rsquo;s very wise.</p></li><li><p><span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>17:52 Diana: I mean, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s&mldr; I don&rsquo;t wanna depend on that, I prefer to do things naturally, so I&rsquo;m trying to follow Dr. Dean&rsquo;s protocol, which I think would be better. But I&rsquo;m a little concerned because every time I go see them, they say, &ldquo;We need to get these numbers lower or we need to get these numbers at a certain level. You need to go on Prolia. You have no choice. You&rsquo;re gonna fracture.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>18:15 <strong>CB:</strong> You always have a choice. <span>[laughter]</span> The other thing that I would like to highlight&mldr; Well, you do, don&rsquo;t you? I mean that&rsquo;s how we live our lives</p></li><li><p><span>[18:22]</span> **** .</p></li><li><p>18:23 Diana: Yeah, I do believe so. Well, I&rsquo;ve actually&mldr; Exactly, yes.</p></li><li><p>18:26 <strong>CB:</strong> One of the really saddest moments I&rsquo;ve had in a long time, was I did a report, actually I was in Europe at this time, and I was showing, here&rsquo;s what the results are of the participants who have had breast cancer occurrences while they were in our project, and at that point in time, there were seven of them. And what their data showed was, six out of the seven, six had stopped taking vitamin D. Now why on earth would they do that? Because their doctor, not being informed enough, told them to stop. So we&rsquo;ve got to&mldr; To me, my mind says individuals have to be educated enough to know what they need and consult with the doctors as opposed to depending upon them so much for everything. Anyway, thank you for listening.</p></li><li><p>19:28 Diana: Yeah, I understand what you&rsquo;re saying. However, I don&rsquo;t know if I need more vitamin D. How do I know? How do I determine whether I do? I know when I need more magnesium, because I start to feel&mldr;</p></li><li><p>19:39 <strong>DD:</strong> Well this is what the research is about, Diana. This is what Carole is saying. Based on the experience and the research and the data, women, to prevent a recurrence of breast cancer, should have stayed with their vitamin D and should have stayed with the level of 60 nanograms. Breast cancer seems to be a specific cohort of people, whereas something like pre-term birth they were okay at 40 nanograms. But to prevent cancer, if you&rsquo;ve got a family history of cancer, if you&rsquo;ve had cancer, the research is showing you need to be at 60 nanograms.</p></li><li><p>20:27 <strong>DD:</strong> And as for this business about the doctors just say, &ldquo;Well, this is what you have to do.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s all they know. They don&rsquo;t know this research, they aren&rsquo;t here on the call studying it and this is where you&rsquo;re getting more information. And it is difficult when you go into the doctor and they say, &ldquo;Well, you have to do this,&rdquo; it just messes with your mind and gives you another conflict that your brain and body has to deal with. And as we&rsquo;re taking a magnesium and calcium because of your bones, well, yes, you need the magnesium in the form of ReMag and yes, you do need some calcium but it&rsquo;s the 600 milligrams you get in your diet and/or with ReCalcia because the magnesium that they&rsquo;re recommending is only 4% absorbed, and what&rsquo;s not absorbed is gonna go into calcification in your soft tissues.</p></li><li><p>21:27 <strong>DD:</strong> So that&rsquo;s it. You can go to the archives and re-listen to that 10 times and really get it into your brain that we&rsquo;re here to support you with common sense rather than what&rsquo;s come down the pike in allopathic medical information, where they base&mldr; What do they base their information on? Nothing to do with nutrients and only to do with what drugs will treat what symptoms.</p></li><li><p>21:58 Diana: Exactly. Yes. That&rsquo;s very true. I agree with you. Yeah, very true. Okay.</p></li><li><p>22:03 <strong>DD:</strong> And that&rsquo;s why the institution is broken for health, and that&rsquo;s why I really want to help us all set up totally different health institutions so that you can not only get the tests, you can get the knowledgeable treatment, you can actually get a special kind of insurance to cover it, rewarding you for being healthy.</p></li><li><p>22:27 Diana: Exactly. Well it&rsquo;s a totally different thing in this country. It&rsquo;s not&mldr; You don&rsquo;t get rewarded for being healthy. They want to take the drugs.</p></li><li><p>22:36 <strong>DD:</strong> Right, yeah. Yeah, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re not important to them unless you follow their recommendations and prescriptions and unless they can find something wrong with you. They&rsquo;re very gleeful to find something wrong with you so that they can prescribe. So did you have a question for me or did I answer that in my little rant?</p></li><li><p>23:00 Diana: I did. No, actually no, but I&rsquo;m glad that you gave that additional feedback Dr. Dean. The other question I have is I usually get regular bottled water at the supermarket, at Whole Foods, but this time my son and daughter went to pick up some water and they didn&rsquo;t have it available. So I wanna know if I need to adjust my magnesium into this new water because it has magnesium chloride in it? So do I need to&mldr; I&rsquo;m now at three teaspoons of magnesium&mldr; I&rsquo;m sorry, no it&rsquo;s magnesium sulfate, I&rsquo;m sorry. So this one has magnesium sulfate. Do I need to reduce the amount of magnesium that I use in my&mldr;</p></li><li><p>23:35 <strong>DD:</strong> How much? How much? How much?</p></li><li><p>23:38 Diana: How much? Let&rsquo;s see what if it says. It doesn&rsquo;t really say, it just says that it&rsquo;s made up of reverse osmosis purified water electrolytes which are a potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate.</p></li><li><p>23:52 <strong>DD:</strong> It wouldn&rsquo;t have anything in it. They have to put the amount if it&rsquo;s above a certain number of milligrams, so they&rsquo;ve just sort of splashed some magnesium sulfate near the processing, near the bottling. So it&rsquo;s got nothing in it. Okay?</p></li><li><p>24:12 Diana: Oh okay. So I don&rsquo;t need to worry about reducing it. Okay, great, thank you. I appreciate it. Have a wonderful night ladies.</p></li><li><p>24:17 <strong>DD:</strong> Good to hear from you again, Diana. And you&rsquo;re sounding stronger and stronger. It&rsquo;s wonderful to watch you flourish. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p></li><li><p>24:26 Diana: Thank you.</p></li><li><p>24:28 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay, bye hon.</p></li><li><p>24:29 Diana: Have a great night, thank you.</p></li><li><p>24:33 <strong>DD:</strong> Over to Ginney.</p></li><li><p>24:34 <strong>GS:</strong> Excellent, wonderful, thank you. Yes, here I am and I wanna just read a couple of questions off the chat line, then we&rsquo;re gonna go to our next callers. One of the&mldr; Carole that came for you is&mldr; Excuse me, I&rsquo;ll read that in a minute. I&rsquo;m in the same boat as the previous e-mailer. That must have been the email that you read earlier Carolyn. I bought NATURELO Vitamin D and took a capsule of 2500 IU for two weeks. My heart palpitations increased. I&rsquo;ve been on the completement formulas for over a year, so I need to figure out that balance, and I think what we wanna reinforce Carole and Carolyn is that this is when you do the testing, is that right?</p></li><li><p>25:19 <strong>CB:</strong> Exactly, exactly. You&rsquo;ve got to.</p></li><li><p>25:22 <strong>GS:</strong> Yeah. It&rsquo;s something&mldr;</p></li><li><p>25:25 <strong>DD:</strong> Yes. And let me just&mldr; Let me just say to Charlie, yes, with that history of taking vitamin D and it affecting you, and I know the NATURELO form, that&rsquo;s the one I take, 2500 units, you&rsquo;d have to try to find something with a much smaller dosage and build up, or just take one 2500 every three days, and just sort of sneak up on this as you determine how much ReMag that you have to take to keep everything in balance. So it&rsquo;s just taking smaller amounts, taking smaller steps and knowing that yes your, as you said, your levels are low, so your body probably needs the vitamin D, but then you just have to do the experiment with yourself to know the balance between the vitamin D and the ReMag and make sure, you probably should be taking three teaspoons of ReMag. Did you have something on that, Carole?</p></li><li><p>26:24 <strong>CB:</strong> No, I think you very clearly said it. I do have a bias towards, or bias isn&rsquo;t exactly the word, it&rsquo;s I think that the deficiency in vitamin D and the levels are very, very clearly associated with health outcomes, and so the urgency that I see is for taking more magnesium as fast as he can to get that up in order to help reduce the palpitations.</p></li><li><p>27:04 <strong>DD:</strong> Right. Very good. Okay, Ginney?</p></li><li><p>27:07 <strong>GS:</strong> Okay, very good, all right, excellent. All right, back to our phone lines area code 480. 480, great state of Arizona, you&rsquo;re on the line with Carole and Dr. Carolyn Dean this evening, if you could give us your name and then state your question or comment.</p></li><li><p>27:29 <strong>GS:</strong> Hello our precious 480 person. Okay, we will press on and we will go to area code 619. 619, you&rsquo;re on the line, great state of California, San Diego.</p></li><li><p>27:43 Cedric Garland: Hi, this is Cedric Garland. And I&rsquo;ve really been enjoying this program because I see Carole, who has led the zeitgeist, it&rsquo;s an obscure scientific finding that we had in a medical journal, that could have stayed on a dusty shelf for decades if not a century, and created a zeitgeist, or&mldr; Someone, it was either Dr. Dean or Ginney mentioned that word earlier. And she&rsquo;s driving this zeitgeist today. So it&rsquo;s just it couldn&rsquo;t be more exciting to meet her and talking about it, and Carole telling that story of it. And there were a few meetings that I ever attended at NIH that made my heart beat faster. And the one that did was when Carole Baggerly spoke truth to power and asked the assembled scientific literati of the National Cancer Institute, &ldquo;Where is your sense of urgency?&rdquo; It just stopped the room. A room of maybe a 100 scientists were frozen when someone asked that question as she so eloquently did, launching this zeitgeist. But anyway, so much for the comment. I&rsquo;d like to ask Carole and Dr. Dean, and others who might wish to comment on it, is there gonna be a zeitgeist for vitamin D with respect to <strong>COVID-19</strong> or the prevention of acute respiratory disease, as has happened with the use of vitamin D and other micronutrients for the prevention of cancer?</p></li><li><p>29:12 <strong>CB:</strong> That&rsquo;s certainly&mldr;</p></li><li><p>29:13 <strong>DD:</strong> Yes, Carole. Please, we do have to get to that question. Thank you so much for bringing it up. Go ahead, Carole.</p></li><li><p>29:24 <strong>CB:</strong> First of all, we would not exist without Dr. Garland. So anybody who can clap or complement this gentleman, he&rsquo;s marvelous. Thank you, Cedric. We want to set up a very special program for, as I mentioned earlier, and it&rsquo;s not clear enough to give it a name, but yes, we need to institute an entirely new trial and everything to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to start tackling cures and halt.&rdquo; We can&rsquo;t just bring people&rsquo;s serum levels up, we&rsquo;re really going to be targeting the prevention and or cure of this with using nutrients especially starting on this one, since we know so much about vitamin D and we know people are so deficient. So yes, there will be a new one.</p></li><li><p>30:22 <strong>CG:</strong> Good, thank you Carole.</p></li><li><p>30:25 <strong>CB:</strong> Thank you, Cedric.</p></li><li><p>30:26 <strong>DD:</strong> And I know with the group that I&rsquo;m working with, the Orthomolecular Medicine Group, we&rsquo;re talking about vitamin C and we definitely talk about vitamin D and magnesium and zinc. So the levels for vitamin D, let&rsquo;s just give out some numbers. Are you saying that you tell people to go to the 50,000 vitamin D3? Because as I understand it, 50,000 is a D2, which is synthetic.</p></li><li><p>31:00 <strong>CB:</strong> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p></li><li><p>31:03 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay.</p></li><li><p>31:03 <strong>CB:</strong> There are 50,000 IU D3 products and that definitely is what you should have.</p></li><li><p>31:09 <strong>DD:</strong> Yes, very good.</p></li><li><p>31:11 <strong>CB:</strong> For this, and those are available. So, we want that to be part of it. One of the things that we are ready for as a society and as health people, and certainly healthcare people that are interested in nutrients, there is another significant effort going on down in Brazil that I&rsquo;ve been familiar with for years. Dr. Coimbra has helped reduce the incidents of and&mldr; Or not the incidents but the side effects of and in some cases, actually cure multiple sclerosis by having very, very large doses and consequently levels of vitamin D in these people and it has to be under medical supervision. This is not something you do on your own. But regardless, what he&rsquo;s demonstrated has been phenomenal. They can actually show brain lesions that existed prior to such treatment, and they&rsquo;re gone afterwards. This is enormous.</p></li><li><p>32:25 <strong>CB:</strong> The other thing is the&mldr; They actually have a user group on the prevention or the cure, as it were, of autism. So it has effects there, higher vitamin D level. And if you take a look at what he has done, what I see Carole, as a result of what he has done and what we&rsquo;ve been able to do, and certainly other people with large groups of people is it&rsquo;s time to move on to disease cures or disease <span>[32:56]</span> **** or whatever you wanna call it, with nutrients. We are currently stuck with, &ldquo;Oh, taking more than that is dangerous.&rdquo; Well, it&rsquo;s not. You do have to watch it. And you do have to measure parathyroid hormone levels, PTH levels and calcium levels. And back again, to the Orthomolecular thing, we also would like to work with them to put together this next phase of a monster way to help make people healthy.</p></li><li><p>33:33 <strong>DD:</strong> Yeah, that&rsquo;s perfect. That&rsquo;s wonderful. And so important because I know the pushback we&rsquo;re getting just for saying that people should take more vitamin C is ridiculous. We have fake news headlines saying that our group of women as is promoting fatal doses of vitamin C. It&rsquo;s a big mountain to climb because there&rsquo;s something about, I guess, the pervasiveness of medicine that has put down nutrients for so long in order to gain their foothold that people, they&rsquo;re in a quandary, they don&rsquo;t know who to believe. So we&rsquo;re here to move this zeitgeist along, Dr. Garland.</p></li><li><p>34:30 <strong>CG:</strong> I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing it. It&rsquo;s so important to the future of humanity.</p></li><li><p>34:38 <strong>DD:</strong> Yes, yes. Now, can you give us some more words Dr. Garland on your work or&mldr; Carole thinks so highly of you. Tell us what you&rsquo;re doing.</p></li><li><p>34:50 <strong>CG:</strong> Well we&rsquo;re doing actually with the GrassrootsHealth cohort is having in existence the only cohort in the world where we can actually catch the effect of people who are taking doses of vitamin D such as 20,000 or 40,000 international units per day, which you cannot find in any other cohort. So if there&rsquo;s a question such as, &ldquo;Is <strong>COVID-19</strong> less likely to attack people who are taking say 20,000, or 40,000, or even 50,000 IU a day of vitamin D3 USP?&rdquo; Is that, judging from serum levels and self reports from the cohort, does that prevent the disease or does it reduce its incidence, and also does it reduce its case fatality rate? And at right now, short of a clinical trial, which would take quite a while to get going, with respect to the time course of this epidemic, the only way to get this information quickly about larger doses of vitamin D against COVID is this cohort.</p></li><li><p>36:03 <strong>CG:</strong> So that, I think, is an exciting consequence of having the cohort. And it&rsquo;s also demonstrated that you&rsquo;d need to get into the high dose range 60 to 80 nanograms per mil to produce very substantial effect on the incidence of cancer, particularly of the breast and colon. But also, we think it&rsquo;s quite likely that you need to be at substantially higher loads of vitamin D in your serum, than have been traditionally in the population, to inhibit the reproduction of viruses and stop either incidence of <strong>COVID-19</strong> or keep it from killing people.</p></li><li><p>36:47 <strong>CG:</strong> And as we see the pattern move through the world, it&rsquo;s almost identical to that of the cancers that we&rsquo;ve been studying, breast and colon. For example, Northern Italy is known for having a high degree of air pollution and a high latitude in the 40s and above, and they were ravaged by COVID-17, 19. But the southern half of Italy, below Rome, seems to have almost escaped it. And the main difference is partly Chinese migrants being more frequent in the North, but it&rsquo;s much greater than that because it&rsquo;s spread from the industrial centers, even places where there were no Chinese migrants. And to us, as people, scientists have looked at the role of sun light and vitamin D deficiency in the genesis of cancer when we see the identical pattern for this disease, we&rsquo;re struck by it. The parallel in the United States is the New York experience, which is awful and going on now. And it was exactly the same story for breast cancer, the mortality rates for breast cancer was more than double in the Borough of Manhattan, New York then it was say in Arizona or New Mexico, in any county. And we&rsquo;re seeing the same pattern, this high latitude plus air pollution combination, which characterizes the New York Metropolitan area as the place where the COVID is prevalent. We just saw it move from the Borough of Manhattan out to Long Island which is also heavily hit with breast cancer and colon cancer for the same reason.</p></li><li><p>38:32 <strong>CG:</strong> It&rsquo;s a generation of electricity by a number of sources in the New York area needed to support the high density of the New York population, which results in the inability of the atmosphere to transmit ultraviolet beam light, which is needed to make vitamin D. So New Yorkers in general are almost undetectable, or at least down way low on the vitamin D scale. And I&rsquo;m guessing at this time of year, around seven or eight, maybe 10 at most as an average, and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve been so ravaged, in my opinion, by COVID. And we need to prove it. We can&rsquo;t conjecture about it without having at least a means of proof, and the cohort that Carole and her staff has assembled is the answer to that question. So I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with Carole and the cohort to provide an answer as soon as we can as to whether we should be supplementing to prevent the incidence or death from COVID-17. And to me, that&rsquo;s the biggest question that we face now.</p></li><li><p>39:38 <strong>CG:</strong> I think we&rsquo;ve established that it prevents breast cancer, and also prevents it from spreading in a patient who has breast cancer, which is a very hard thing to do, and the same for colorectal cancer. If you look deeper it&rsquo;s also true for bladder cancer, and lung cancer and several others that are kind of almost unexpected would be related to vitamin D deficiency, but on a world scope are. So that&rsquo;s been established. It&rsquo;s now a matter of dissemination of those findings, but we still have to establish that vitamin D can maybe save us from the repeated scourge of COVID and other Coronaviruses.</p></li><li><p>40:20 <strong>DD:</strong> Right, right. Now, my brain lit up when you said high levels of electricity in the New York atmosphere blocking UV radiation. Please tell us about that.</p></li><li><p>40:32 <strong>CG:</strong> High levels of <strong>air pollution</strong> .</p></li><li><p>40:34 <strong>DD:</strong> Oh, air pollution.</p></li><li><p>40:35 <strong>CG:</strong> Largely ammonium sulfate. That&rsquo;s air pollution.</p></li><li><p>40:38 <strong>DD:</strong> Got it. Ah, of course. Yes, yes, yes. And&mldr;</p></li><li><p>40:41 <strong>CG:</strong> When you have so many people confined to a small area, all of whom use electricity, whether it&rsquo;s for their lights or their elevators or their electric ranges, you have to produce a lot of electricity right nearby, and there are companies in the vicinity in New York, also in adjoining states, in Connecticut, that produce a huge amount of electricity, but they do it&mldr; Historically, have done it by burning coal from the Ohio Valley and Pennsylvania, and that leaves a substance in the air, sulfur dioxide, which is converted to ammonium sulfate, and we call it acid haze, it&rsquo;s the precursor of acid rain, and one thing it does is to acidify the lakes of New York. But the worst thing that it does is to prevent the people who live there from making vitamin D in the natural way by photosynthesis in skin, and so the atmosphere there blocks the making of vitamin D, it also provides condensation nuclei to form clouds making the area much cloudier than it would be under normal conditions.</p></li><li><p>41:48 <strong>CG:</strong> That also blocks the vitamin D synthesis, and to make matters even worse, there&rsquo;s an arctic air mass that comes down from Canada during the winter and some of the spring that also makes it impossible to get outside and expose any skin just because it&rsquo;s too cold. You take all those things together, and the indoor lifestyle, most dramatic in Manhattan, in the concrete canyons where almost no sunlight is available, and you end up with the highest rates in the world of cancer of the breast and colon, and now we&rsquo;re seeing exactly that pattern for COVID and nobody knowing just where to turn. But we think there is a place for people to turn. It&rsquo;s not exactly a panacea, it probably would not eliminate COVID, <strong>COVID-19</strong> infection or death, but it&rsquo;s pretty likely that it would substantially reduce it and the more we reduce it, pending the discovery of a vaccine, the more lives we can save. But we need to test it.</p></li><li><p>42:52 <strong>DD:</strong> Right.</p></li><li><p>42:52 <strong>CB:</strong> There is one other&mldr; There are so many opportunities with vitamin D. One quick thing, Carolyn, is the&mldr; Dr. Garland has put together a lot of graphs, one of which he calls the smiley curve. And we are currently&mldr; One of the reasons we got into the omega-3 testing was because really the vitamin D curve of the incidence of type 1 diabetes is almost zero at the equator and it goes up very rapidly around the&mldr; As you get higher or higher up in the latitudes. And so the</p></li><li><p><span>[43:33]</span> **** have been working with research groups that maybe all of those expensive and very&mldr; Whatever drugs that you are taking for type 1 diabetes&mldr; I mean just, it&rsquo;s enormous. So thank you again, Cedric, and for all the work that Carolyn you&rsquo;re doing with all of your magnesium as well. Excuse me.</p></li><li><p>43:57 <strong>CG:</strong> Oh, thank you for getting this word out.</p></li><li><p>44:03 <strong>DD:</strong> The timing is perfect because this is not our first virus, the <strong>COVID-19</strong> . This is not our first rodeo. We are developing the resources and the cohorts and these projects for what may come and we may be able to prevent it. We&rsquo;ve created such a perfect storm of nutrient deficiencies on all levels: Selenium, zinc, magnesium, the vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids. We&rsquo;ve processed our food out of all recognition, and now we are reaping those benefits, and this is what we&rsquo;re trying to get across. And, Dr. Garland, you&rsquo;ll like this quote, &ldquo;The scientist rigorously defends his right or her right to be ignorant of almost everything except their own specialty.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re running up against, is&mldr;</p></li><li><p><span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>45:07 <strong>CG:</strong> It&rsquo;s true.</p></li><li><p>45:08 <strong>DD:</strong> It&rsquo;s true. And what you and Carole are doing, is creating this project, where we&rsquo;re looking at as many nutrients as we can, and with the computers we&rsquo;re able to sift out this data. This is incredible, what you&rsquo;re telling us about New York and incidence of breast cancer and other cancers, and COVID accumulation. So it&rsquo;s all beginning to make sense, and we&rsquo;re here to help bring people out of this storm.</p></li><li><p>45:50 <strong>CG:</strong> I believe it. Thank you for doing it.</p></li><li><p>45:51 <strong>CB:</strong> And you are a delight to work with. <span>[laughter]</span> Thank you.</p></li><li><p>45:54 <strong>DD:</strong> Thank you.</p></li><li><p><span>[laughter]</span></p></li><li><p>45:57 <strong>DD:</strong> Yeah, it&rsquo;s great.</p></li><li><p>46:00 <strong>CB:</strong> All of you.</p></li><li><p>46:00 <strong>DD:</strong> Ginney, get in here, we&rsquo;re having a little love fest. What do you want to say?</p></li><li><p>46:02 <strong>GS:</strong> I&rsquo;m just basking in the glow. I&rsquo;m just basking in the glow. It&rsquo;s absolutely glorious, and it is so true, and it is perfect. And the only thing I wish we could do would be the Vulcan Mind Meld to take all three of your brains, and then put them in the general vicinity of everybody else&rsquo;s brain, so that they could hook in, hook up, hook on, and get with the program, and not wait around for medicine or anybody else that&rsquo;s standing at any press conference at 5 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon to figure out what the heck&rsquo;s going on but to really take control of their health. That&rsquo;s what we want, and even if you&rsquo;ve cobbled a handful of some vitamin D, some magnesium, get some zinc rolling, and a little Pico Silver, you&rsquo;re gonna be Aeons ahead of this game. Agreed?</p></li><li><p>46:55 <strong>CG:</strong> I would certainly enthusiastically vote for that.</p></li><li><p>46:58 <strong>CB:</strong> I agree.</p></li><li><p>47:01 <strong>DD:</strong> Okay, Dr. Garland stay on, we&rsquo;ll see if we have any callers with questions or chat questions. We don&rsquo;t wanna waste your resources. This is wonderful, I&rsquo;m so glad you came on.</p></li><li><p>47:15 <strong>CG:</strong> I&rsquo;m glad to be a part of this.</p></li><li><p>47:18 <strong>DD:</strong> Ginney any chats <span>[47:20]</span> **** phone?</p></li><li><p>47:21 <strong>GS:</strong> One of the questions that came up was, can you talk about the relationship and the use of&mldr; Again, going through the multiple nutrients, we haven&rsquo;t talked about zinc tonight and can we talk a little bit about vitamin D and zinc?</p></li><li><p>47:36 <strong>CG:</strong> Carole would you like to do that?</p></li><li><p>47:41 <strong>DD:</strong> Let me start out, what we&rsquo;ve been doing on my Monday radio shows. We had a group from Orthomolecular Medical Society and Dr. Tom Levy brought up that it was the association of hydroxychloroquine and zinc that was really helping people, because hydroxychloroquine will open up the cells and then the zinc will shoot into the cells and disrupt the virus. So, he was saying that around exposure to COVID, people could be taking 30 or 40 milligrams of zinc. And certainly, there are zinc lozenges that people use for any virus, any throat infections. So there&rsquo;s a long history of zinc and the immune system, but I&rsquo;m not aware of zinc and vitamin D, Carole or doctor.</p></li><li><p>48:46 <strong>CB:</strong> I am not, at this point in time, aware of that. I do have another research paper that I have read that I think is significant that brings in yet another thing that we are doing with our diets and things, which is, there was a paper published quite some years ago that said that the virus&mldr; Coronavirus, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t 19, would not even attach to the cells of the lungs or any place else, if the pH level was in a normal alkaline range. And obviously, you can&rsquo;t go in and test your pH level, whatever, but it appears that there is some validity to the assertion that if you do a urine sample first thing in the morning that what you have is an alkaline based urine, then that is a good reflection of what&rsquo;s in your bladder, which could possibly refer back to the cell&rsquo;s ability to even accept this COVID virus. It&rsquo;s beyond my biochemistry, but I wanted to bring up the whole alkaline thing up because I know that you pay attention to that, as do other people. So be healthy in many ways, I think can help that.</p></li><li><p>50:25 <strong>CG:</strong> I have nothing to add to that, I agree with you.</p></li><li><p>50:29 <strong>GS:</strong> Very good. And let&rsquo;s talk about the optimal form of vitamin D that everybody&mldr; Product recommendations or Carolyn, what are you recommending right now and where are we at with that? &lsquo;Cause several of our callers and listeners have chatted in about that.</p></li><li><p>50:50 <strong>DD:</strong> Right, and someone already mentioned the one that I&rsquo;ve gone to. I was just taking the Blue Ice Royal which is a fermented cod liver oil and butter oil, but I was afraid our people weren&rsquo;t getting enough vitamin D, and that&rsquo;s why we joined Grassroots&rsquo; project. And now, when I found out the abysmal level of my vitamin D, I went to the NATURELO vitamin D, which is from plant lichens. So I&rsquo;m doing a 2500, two of them a day to get my 5000, and I&rsquo;ll do my testing soon and see where I&rsquo;m at. I like&mldr; I&rsquo;m glad to hear that at 50,000 IUs of vitamin D, you can get a vitamin D3. I always recommend that because the synthetic D2, you may get your levels up and then they&rsquo;ll just plummet, apparently. So Carole and Dr. Garland have much more experience with different types. What are you recommending Carole?</p></li><li><p>52:02 <strong>CB:</strong> The only thing that we recommend there, is really vitamin D3. What we have had the value of doing with our project also though, is the&mldr; If it&rsquo;s listed as D3 and it is a brand that people can trust for various reasons, we really don&rsquo;t see any real difference in the brands, other than that person&rsquo;s preference or availability and are mixed with other products. So, the other thing about vitamin D though is what people recommend is, &ldquo;Oh, well I buy this and it&rsquo;s got this, this and this in it,&rdquo; and we always recommend to buy something with only vitamin D in it, because you might need twice as much as somebody else and you don&rsquo;t wanna take twice as much of X, along with that. So I think that&rsquo;s really important as well.</p></li><li><p>53:08 <strong>DD:</strong> Dr. Garland?</p></li><li><p>53:11 <strong>CG:</strong> I agree completely. I notice there are some vitamin D3 products out now that are USP, that have been tested for purity and correct concentration by the US Pharmacopeia. If you wanted to go beyond&mldr; Well Carole just mentioned that might be one choice, but the reality is, it seems like, so far, the vitamin D3 is vitamin D3. And as long as it&rsquo;s vitamin D3 and it&rsquo;s labelled, ideally it&rsquo;s a product that&rsquo;s used to interstate commerce, so there&rsquo;s some protection for the validity of the label claim. Then it&rsquo;s good. When I buy vitamin D, I do make sure to get it from a supplier that&rsquo;s outside of my state because then I know I&rsquo;ve got the federal protection that comes from the interstate transfer.</p></li><li><p>54:03 <strong>CG:</strong> But other than that, vitamin D3 is vitamin D3. The important thing is to take the right amount to raise the level in the blood to, my view now, 60 to 80 nanograms particularly in the context of the <strong>COVID-19</strong> virus. And not worry too much about the brand as much as whether you&rsquo;re getting enough of it and confirming it in the blood. Because it doesn&rsquo;t matter in a sense how much you take, what matters is the level that you achieve. And we found this in study after study, if there&rsquo;s anything to be learned in addition to that, it&rsquo;s that vitamin D works on a daily basis. So people who are not necessarily totally on board with all the findings, will sometimes give people vitamin D on a monthly or a weekly basis. And you know what? It does not work. A nature of vitamin D3, it has to be taken daily. It&rsquo;s pretty rapidly metabolized the 25-hydroxy vitamin D and various other metabolites. And unless it&rsquo;s taken on a daily basis it does not work. And we can say that with great certainty because enough people have tried it to know it doesn&rsquo;t work, whereas the studies that administer it on a daily basis, find an effect starting with 10,000 IU and then working up.</p></li><li><p>55:20 <strong>DD:</strong> So what I said to Charlie earlier, Charlie if you&rsquo;re still there, I said, &ldquo;Well take you 2,500 and take it every three days.&rdquo; So no, it would be better to get a 500 or 1,000 units of D3 and take one every day. So thank you for that.</p></li><li><p>55:37 <strong>CG:</strong> Absolutely.</p></li><li><p>55:38 <strong>DD:</strong> Very good.</p></li><li><p>55:39 <strong>CG:</strong> Oh good, I&rsquo;m glad you have that, you&rsquo;re making that point and I agree with it.</p></li><li><p>55:44 <strong>GS:</strong> And just with two minutes to the top of the hour, can I ask Dr. Garland, Carole, Carolyn does a person need to take K2 with their vitamin D3?</p></li><li><p>55:56 <strong>CG:</strong> I&rsquo;m happy to answer that one first and others may add. It&rsquo;s a very good idea to do that particularly for men who have&mldr; Not that many ways of preventing cancer of the prostate or limiting it&rsquo;s threat, and so the number one treatment for someone who has prostate cancer to prevent spread and threatening of the life of the patient is enough vitamin D, assuming that whatever surgery was needed has been done and it&rsquo;s gonna work way better according to some studies in Europe if there&rsquo;s also vitamin K2 or menaquinone present. So absolutely, we should have both if we can stand taking that many pills. But particularly if you&rsquo;re a man it&rsquo;s worth it. And it&rsquo;s probably gonna be beneficial in women too.</p></li><li><p>56:45 <strong>GS:</strong> And do we know the relationship there? What&rsquo;s the ratio or&mldr;</p></li><li><p>56:50 <strong>DD:</strong> The dose.</p></li><li><p>56:51 <strong>CG:</strong> Well, normally we&rsquo;re thinking about somewhere between 150 and 250 micrograms per day as vitamin K2 along with whatever the amount of vitamin D you need as to maintain 60 nanograms, which for most people is gonna be at least 6,000 IU per day, and for many it&rsquo;s gonna be 10,000 IU. And for some people who are just terrible absorbers of vitamin D they might need 20,000 IU a day of vitamin D. But the serum test is the way to determine what the dose is and we&rsquo;re kind of in the dark unless we actually measure the vitamin D in the serum, which isn&rsquo;t so hard anymore.</p></li><li><p>57:29 <strong>GS:</strong> Okay, we&rsquo;ve got one minute left. It&rsquo;s been such an extraordinary show. Carolyn your final thoughts, and then everybody go back and listen to this again. Carolyn, your final thoughts?</p></li><li><p>57:39 <strong>DD:</strong> My final thoughts. Bob, you&rsquo;re gonna be taking your vitamin D okay? And I&rsquo;m gonna get you some vitamin K2. Okay. Carole.</p></li><li><p>57:52 <strong>CB:</strong> I just am so thankful for all the scientists that I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with to help them get the word out. And so, be aware everybody that the scientists of the world care and they&rsquo;re doing their best to try to get this message out.</p></li><li><p>58:10 <strong>DD:</strong> Very good, excellent. Thank you Carole. Thank you Dr. Garland. Thank you Ginney. Thank you Bob. Thank you Bill in the chamber there, making this all happen.
