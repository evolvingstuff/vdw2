#### Omega-3 reduced lipids even in those getting  rosuvastatin - RCT Jan 2018

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of adding ω-3 fatty acids to rosuvastatin in patients with residual hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment.

Methods

This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a 4-week run-in period of rosuvastatin treatment, the patients who had residual hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to receive rosuvastatin 20 mg/d plus ω-3 fatty acids 4 g/d (ROSUMEGA group) or rosuvastatin 20 mg/d (rosuvastatin group) with a 1:1 ratio and were prescribed each medication for 8 weeks.

Findings

A total of 201 patients were analyzed (mean <span>[SD]</span> age, 58.1 <span>[10.7]</span> years; 62.7% male). After 8 weeks of treatment, the percentage change from baseline in triglycerides (TGs) and non–HDL-C was significantly greater in the ROSUMEGA group than in the rosuvastatin group (TGs: −26.3% vs −11.4%, P < 0.001; non–HDL-C: −10.7% vs −2.2%, P = 0.001). In the linear regression analysis, the lipid-lowering effect of ω-3 fatty acids was greater when baseline TG or non−HDL-C levels were high and body mass index was low. The incidence of adverse events was not significantly different between the 2 groups.

Implications

In patients with residual hypertriglyceridemia despite statin treatment, a combination of ω-3 fatty acids and rosuvastatin produced a greater reduction of TGs and non−HDL-C than rosuvastatin alone. Further study is needed to determine whether the advantages of this lipid profile of ω-3 fatty acids actually leads to the prevention of cardiovascular event.
