Published online 2009 April 23. [doi:  10.1111/j.1399-0012.2009.00989.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-0012.2009.00989.x)

Introduction: Although patients with end-stage organ failure are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency because of limited sunlight exposure and hepatic dysfunction, few studies have measured 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) at the time of transplantation.

Methods: We measured serum 25OHD immediately after transplantation in 69 heart and liver transplant recipients.

Results: Forty-six heart and 23 liver transplant recipients were evaluated (mean age 53 yr). Mean 25OHD was well below the lower limit of the normal range (43.2 ± 21.2 nmol/L). 

Ninety-one percent had levels below 75 nmol/L, the threshold commonly used to denote sufficiency, and 71% had levels below 50 nmol/L. Severe deficiency (25OHD <25 nmol/L) was found in 16%. Vitamin D levels did not differ by race, age, gender, or season. Mean 25OHD was lower among liver than heart transplant recipients (34.4 ± 17.5 vs. 47.7 ± 20.7 nmol/L; p < 0.03). Among liver transplant recipients, 22% had undetectable levels (<17 nmol/L).

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among heart and liver transplant recipients; those with liver failure are at greatest risk. As vitamin D deficiency has many serious skeletal and extra-skeletal sequelae, physicians who treat transplant patients should maintain a high degree of vigilance for this problem.
