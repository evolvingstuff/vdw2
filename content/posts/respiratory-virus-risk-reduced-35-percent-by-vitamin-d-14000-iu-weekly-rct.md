 **Comments on the study by VitaminDWiki** 

1. They appeared to start counting the infections immediately after starting the vitamin D, rather than waiting 4-6 months for the blood levels to plateau

1. Virtually all of the children had a high level of vitamin D to start with, so raising it even more should not be expected to result in a large benefit

1. They used the amount of Vitamin D independent of age/weight

> Suspect that at least 2800 IU Vitamin D would be needed for the older/heavier children

*  **<span style="color:#00F;">Suspect > 50% reduction if </span>  
had used more Vitamin D (to get most about 40 ng),   
had started before flu season,   
had used dose size was proportional to weight,   
children did not have such a high level to start with**
