 **[Trial Site News](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/18.6k-school-children-to-get-suspended-for-lack-of-updated-vaccination-1526e270)** 

* "According to Canadian media accounts, 18,643 elementary school students who don't have updated vaccination records are getting suspension orders from the Region of Waterloo Public Health.  Apparently, the parents/families of the children have six weeks to update vaccination records, obtain the necessary vaccines or apply for an exemption prior to the March 27 effect date. Secondary students may face suspension starting May 1."
