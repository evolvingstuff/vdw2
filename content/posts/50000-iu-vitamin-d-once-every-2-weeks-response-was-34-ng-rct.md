Objective: To compare between weekly and daily cholecalciferol in patients with hypovitaminosis D and to determine the optimal maintenance dose.

Methods: Seventy-one volunteers with hypovitaminosis D were randomly assigned to 2 dose regimens: cholecalciferol 50 000 IU weekly for 8 weeks, then 50 000 IU monthly for 2 months (group A ) and 7000 IU daily for 8 weeks, then 12 500 IU weekly for 2 months (group B ). Cholecalciferol was stopped for 2 months and reintroduced as 50 000 IU bimonthly for group A and 50 000 IU monthly for group B.

Results: Two months after therapy, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level increased from 11.4 to 51.2 ng/mL and from 11.7 to 44.9 ng/mL in groups A and B, respectively ( P = .065). The levels of 25(OH)D declined similarly in both groups during maintenance and after holding therapy. After resuming cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D levels increased to 33.8 and 28.8 ng/mL in groups A and B, respectively ( P = .027). There was a negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and body mass index (BMI; P = .040).

Conclusion: Timing and frequency of the dosing (daily vs weekly) have no effect on the rise in serum 25(OH)D levels as long as the accumulative dose of cholecalciferol is similar. Cholecalciferol 50 000 IU bimonthly is required to maintain sufficient 25(OH)D levels.
