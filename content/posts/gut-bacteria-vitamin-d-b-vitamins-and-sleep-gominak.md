#### The SURPRISING Connection Between Vitamin D, GUT BACTERIA & Sleep" with Dr. Stasha Gominak

 **[211 minutes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Do2GTWhpA)**

##### Key points by [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/share/bf44e957-ed39-424b-b847-30f5e2012412) (includes transcript)

•  **Vitamin D receptors exist in brain "sleep switches"** , indicating D plays a crucial role in regulating sleep. Sleep isn't just about unconsciousness but requires specific deep phases (slow-wave sleep and REM sleep) for proper restoration.

•  **Vitamin D deficiency correlates with sleep disorders** . Dr. Gominak found that when patients' vitamin D levels reached 60-80 ng/ml, their sleep quality significantly improved.

•  **Vitamin D is a hormone, not a vitamin** . It was incorrectly classified, and D3 (not D2) is what humans naturally produce from sunlight. D2 supplementation can actually block D3 utilization.

•  **The microbiome connection is crucial** . After about 2 years of vitamin D supplementation alone, many patients developed new symptoms (joint pain, burning sensations). This led to the discovery that  **vitamin D affects gut bacteria, which produce B vitamins.** 

•  **The B vitamin complex, especially B5 (pantothenic acid)** , is essential for acetylcholine production. 

   * &nbsp; Acetylcholine is vital for proper sleep cycles, inflammation control, and autonomic nervous system function.

•  **Supplementation protocol timing matters** . Dr. Gominak found patients needed B vitamins temporarily (about 3 months), after which the restored gut bacteria began producing sufficient amounts, making continued high supplementation counterproductive.

•  **Modern indoor lifestyle has disrupted this system** . Lack of sun exposure leads to vitamin D deficiency, which affects gut bacteria, leading to B vitamin deficiencies and a cascade of health problems including sleep disorders, autoimmune conditions, and inflammation.

•  **Personalized approach is necessary** . Testing vitamin D levels (ideally using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy) and B12 levels helps determine individual supplementation needs, which vary widely based on deficiency history and severity.

•  **Many "modern diseases" may link to this pathway** . Dr. Gominak suggests conditions like 

   * hypertension, 

   * autoimmunity, 

   * anxiety, 

   * depression, and 

   * chronic pain 

   * &nbsp; often connect to acetylcholine deficiency stemming from this D-microbiome-B vitamin cascade.
