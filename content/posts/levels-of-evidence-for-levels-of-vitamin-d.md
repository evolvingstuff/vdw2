Objective: Clarify the concept of vitamin D sufficiency, the relationship between efficacy and vitamin D status and the role of Vitamin D supplementation in the management of non-skeletal diseases. We outline reasons for anticipating different serum vitamin D levels are required for different diseases. Method: Review the literature for evidence of efficacy of supplementation and minimum effective 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in non-skeletal disease. 

Results: Evidence of efficacy of vitamin supplementation is graded according to levels of evidence. Minimum effective serum 25-OHD levels are lower for skeletal disease, e.g., rickets (25 nmol/L), osteoporosis and fractures (50 nmol/L), than for premature mortality (75 nmol/L) or non-skeletal diseases, e.g., depression (75 nmol/L), diabetes and cardiovascular disease (80 nmol/L), falls and respiratory infections (95 nmol/L) and cancer (100 nmol/L). 

Conclusions: Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation at serum 25-OHD levels ranging from 25 to 100 nmol/L has been obtained from trials with vitamin D interventions that change vitamin D status by increasing serum 25-OHD to a level consistent with sufficiency for that disease. This evidence supports the hypothesis that just as vitamin D metabolism is tissue dependent, so the serum levels of 25-OHD signifying deficiency or sufficiency are disease dependent.

### 5. Findings

* Premature mortality—There is Level I evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces premature mortality. A Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a 6% reduction in all-cause mortality <sup>[23]</sup>, with observational data from the NHANES and ESTHER studies suggesting a minimum 25-OHD concentration of 75 nmol/L for preventing premature mortality <sup>[24,25]</sup>.

* Cancer—There is Level II evidence from one RCT that vitamin D supplementation leads to a substantial reduction in overall risk of internal cancers <sup>[26]</sup>. The reported minimum 25-OHD concentration for cancer prevention is 100 nmol/L <sup>[27]</sup> whilst a review shows an inverse, non-linear relationship between 25-OHD levels and cancer risk <sup>[28]</sup>.

* Muscle function and falls—There is Level I evidence from a meta-analysis that demonstrated a 26% reduction in falls with vitamin D supplementation <sup>[29]</sup>. Other meta-analyses <span>[30-32]</span> that included RCTs with design limitations reached a null conclusion <sup>[33]</sup>. The optimal 25-OHD concentration for lowest risk of falls is 95 nmol/L <sup>[34]</sup>.

* There is Level II evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D deficiency for lower limb muscle strength <sup>[35]</sup>.

* Cardiovascular disease—There is Level III-2 evidence that vitamin D protects against cardiovascular disease from three meta-analyses of cohort studies <sup>[36,37]</sup>. One study of 300,000 person years demonstrated a 39% reduction in IHD in people with high 25-OHD concentrations in comparison with those with severe deficiency and a similar effect on incidence of ischaemic stroke <sup>[38]</sup>. In another study, Vitamin D supplementation conferred substantial survival benefit (OR for death 0.39p < 0.0001) in cardiac patients <sup>[39]</sup>. These estimates are very similar to those proposed in an earlier systematic review and meta-analysis by Parker et al. <sup>[40]</sup>. The reported minimum 25-OHD concentration associated with lowest CVD risk is 80 nmol/L <sup>[41]</sup>.

* Respiratory infections—There is Level II evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces rates of respiratory infections including pneumonia <sup>[42]</sup>, influenza <sup>[43]</sup> and upper respiratory infections <sup>[44]</sup>. This is supported by epidemiological studies for tuberculosis <sup>[45,46]</sup> and other respiratory infections <span>[47-49]</span>. The reported minimum 25OH-D concentration associated with a reduced incidence of viral respiratory infections is 95 nmol/L <sup>[50]</sup>.

* Diabetes—There is Level II evidence from two randomized controlled trials that vitamin D supplementation improves insulin sensitivity and decreases insulin resistance <sup>[51,52]</sup>. This is supported by three meta-analysis of cohort studies, which found low 25-OHD concentrations predicted increased risk of type 2 diabetes <span>[53-55]</span>. The reported minimum vitamin D concentration for reducing insulin resistance is 80 nmol/L <sup>[56]</sup>.

* Depression—There is Level II evidence that vitamin D supplementation is effective in treating depression from four RCTs in which supplementation significantly reduced depression in vitamin D deficient depressed patients <span>[56-59]</span>. The reported minimum 25OH-D concentration associated with reduced depression is 95 nmol/L <sup>[58]</sup>.

* Dental disease—There is Level II evidence from a RCT for dental caries <sup>[60]</sup>. There is also evidence from the NHANES database showing that attachment loss (AL) is significantly and inversely correlated with serum 25-OHD concentrations in those aged over 50 years AL was lowest in individuals whose 25-OHD levels exceeded 84 nmol/L <sup>[61]</sup>.

* Pain—There is Level II evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients who are also vitamin D deficient <sup>[62]</sup>. An RCT in vitamin D insufficient non-Western immigrants in the Netherlands showed a clinically meaningful positive effect on pain 6 weeks after high-dose vitamin D supplementation <sup>[63]</sup>. No threshold level has been proposed.

* Health service utilisation and costs—There is Level III-2 evidence that vitamin D deficiency increases health care utilisation and cost. A large study of health care costs in US veterans found that vitamin D deficiency predicted increased health care costs at all six participating sites <sup>[64]</sup>. Another study estimated that health care utilisation was 39% higher in vitamin D deficient patients <sup>[65]</sup>. Vitamin D supplementation may be more cost effective than currently funded prevention programs; single studies show that supplementation appears to be more cost effective than screening programs for bowel cancer <sup>[66]</sup> and more cost effective than multifactorial interventions for preventing falls in the elderly <sup>[67]</sup>. Considering the economic burden of disease due to vitamin D deficiency, the estimated benefit of increasing vitamin D status across Western Europe was said to be €187b per year <sup>[68]</sup>, calculated on a population basis the equivalent figure for Australia was $14b per year.
