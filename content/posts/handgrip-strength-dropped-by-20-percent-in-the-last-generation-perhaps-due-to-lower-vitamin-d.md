*  **Longish interesting article in which vitamin D is not mentioned once** 

* They speculate that the 20% decrease in a generation was due to less exercise.

* However, they mentioned [handgrip testing of infants less than 1 month old in 1892](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ST18920123.2.30%20)

> Most newborns were able to hang from a horizontal pole for more than 10 seconds

> It seems unlikely that newborns can hang that long now, more than 120 years later

* Grip strength was not only “inversely associated with  **all-cause mortality** ”—every 5 kilogram (kg) decrement in grip strength was associated with a  **17 percent risk increase**  — but as the team, led by McMaster University professor of medicine Darryl Leong, noted: “ **Grip strength was a stronger predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than systolic blood pressure** .”

* Another article [Millennials May Be Losing Their Grip](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/13/481590997/millennials-may-be-losing-their-grip) NPR June 2016

> “In 1985, men ages 20-24 had an average right-handed grip of 121 pounds and left-handed grip of 105 pounds. Today, men that age had grips of only 101 and 99 pounds, the study found.

> Summary: In a generation - handgrip strength 121 lbs ==> 101 lbs

 **VitaminDWiki speculates that the reduced strength is in part due to decreased Vitamin D in a generation** 

 **20% increase in muscle strength found with vitamin D supplementation**

> Just 1600 IU vitamin D + Calcium was 16X more likely to increase grip strength in 10 months
