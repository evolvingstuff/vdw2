Background: Vitamin D is commonly used in clinical practice, while its clinical significance in critically ill patients remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systemic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of vitamin D on this patient population.

Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases from inception until August 15, 2024. Studies evaluating critically ill adult patients who received vitamin D compared to controls were included. The primary outcome was short-term mortality. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool and GRADE system to evaluate the study quality and evidence. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, mechanical ventilation (MV) duration, and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU or hospital. We also conducted meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) to explore the potential heterogeneity among the included trials.

Results: Nineteen RCTs with 2,754 patients were eligible. Overall, vitamin D significantly increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and significantly reduced the short-term mortality (risk ratio <span>[RR]</span> = 0.83; 95%CI, 0.70–0.98; p = 0.03, I2 = 13%), duration of MV (MD = −2.96 days; 95% CI, −5.39 to −0.52; I2 = 77%; p = 0.02) and ICU LOS (MD = −2.66 days; 95% CI, −4.04 to −1.29, I2 = 70%; p = 0.0001) but not hospital LOS (MD = −0.48 days; 95% CI, −2.37 to 1.40; I2 = 31%; p = 0.61). The meta-regression analysis revealed that the proportion of MV (MV%) accounted for the source of heterogeneity, and the subgroup analyses based on MV% suggested that the MV group was more likely to benefit from vitamin D applications than the partly MV group in all the predefined outcomes (all p values<0.05). TSA for short-term mortality suggested that more data is required to confirm our main conclusion.

Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and significantly benefited critically ill patients, especially those with MV.
