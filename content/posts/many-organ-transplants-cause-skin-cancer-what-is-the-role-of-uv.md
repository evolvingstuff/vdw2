Skin cancers remain the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms among organ transplant recipients (OTRs), comprising nearly 40% of all posttransplant malignancies. 

The occurrence of skin tumors has a considerable impact on the quality of life and the overall survival of OTRs. 

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the major environmental cause of nonmelanoma skin cancers, and it is therefore pivotal to protect the skin from UVR in order to prevent de novo and progression of preinvasive and invasive malignancies. 

The present chapter delivers background information on UVR, photoprotection and accompanying concerns regarding vitamin D, as well as educational and behavioral aspects of photoprotection in OTRs; some common misconceptions and mistakes regarding photoprotection are addressed as well.
