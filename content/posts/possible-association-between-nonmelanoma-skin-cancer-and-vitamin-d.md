BACKGROUND: Based on empirical evidence, a personal history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has been hypothesized to be a risk factor for other cancers. Others hypothesize that NMSC may be a marker of high cutaneous vitamin D synthesis and therefore inversely associated with risk of other malignancies. To reconcile these divergent views, we carried out a systematic review to determine the association between NMSC and subsequent risk of other cancers. 

METHODS: Bibliographic databases were searched through March 2009. Studies were included if sufficient information was presented to estimate the risk of developing other cancers following NMSC. Studies were reviewed and data were abstracted independently in duplicate with disagreements resolved by consensus. 

RESULTS: Of the 21 included studies, 15 reported the association between NMSC and risk of all other cancers combined. NMSC was significantly associated with increased risk of another malignancy among cohort studies based on cancer registries <a href="/posts/overview-suntans-melanoma-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1462">Overview Suntans melanoma and vitamin D</a>
