# [USANA](http://www.usana.com/) is a large supplement provider.  "Nutritionals you can trust"

### Started in 1992, in 14 countries in 2010, pricey but very nice

### They do not appear to sell 5,000 IU capsules, yet their chart shows that 5,000 is how much many people need

### Their solid tablet has 2000 IU and 30 mg of vitamin K (does not say: K1 vs K2)

There have been several reports of problems with vitamin D in solid tablets - about 1/3 the benefit as capsule form

But, the chart below implies that USANA solid tablet is OK

This assumes that most of the USANA customers were taking USANA supplements, and not just those at the left side of the graph.

Note the great number of USANA customers taking 2,000  or 4,000 on the graph. 

This correlates with USANA selling 2,000 IU tablets

# [USANA's comment on Institute of Medicine Dec 6 pronouncement](http://usanaleads.blogspot.com/2010/12/iom-report-on-vitamin-d.html)

## USANA "continues to recommend that supplemental vitamin D in the range of <span style="color:#F00;">2000 to 4000 IU</span> per day is much more appropriate for maintaining overall health."
