#### how does Fluoride in the water reduce Vitamin D in the blood?[Asked Perplexity AI Nov 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-does-fluoride-in-the-water-uZrIQENPQjmOfP_WoEalZA)

Based on the search results, fluoride in drinking water can significantly impact vitamin D levels through several mechanisms:** Direct Correlation **Research has demonstrated a strong negative correlation between water fluoride levels and vitamin D in the blood. People living in areas with high fluoride concentrations (>1.5 mg/L) are five times more likely to develop severe vitamin D deficiency &nbsp; [1 (VitaminDWiki)](https://VitaminDWiki.com/High%20fluoride%20in%20water:%205X%20more%20likely%20to%20be%20Vitamin%20D%20deficient%20–%20Jan%202023) &nbsp; [3](https://iwaponline.com/jwh/article/21/1/125/92696/Vitamin-D-deficiency-in-patients-with-diabetes-and)** Mechanisms of Action **** Calcium Disruption *** Fluoride interferes with calcium metabolism and transport across cell membranes  &nbsp; [2](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154164)

* This disruption affects the renal tubules and plasma membrane function  &nbsp; [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32814853/)

* The interference leads to calcium depletion in bone structures and abnormal calcium concentrations in blood  &nbsp; [2](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154164)** Hormonal Impact *** High fluoride exposure can damage the parathyroid gland, leading to hyperparathyroidism &nbsp; [2](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154164)

* This affects the regulation of both calcium and vitamin D metabolism &nbsp; [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32814853/)

* The disruption creates a cascade effect on vitamin D-related hormones &nbsp; [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32814853/)** Clinical Evidence **Multiple studies have confirmed this relationship:

* Hospital-based studies show significant negative correlation between water fluoride and vitamin D levels (correlation coefficient = -0.777)  &nbsp; [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36705502/)

* Research demonstrates that people in fluoride-endemic areas have higher odds of severe vitamin D deficiency  &nbsp; [3](https://iwaponline.com/jwh/article/21/1/125/92696/Vitamin-D-deficiency-in-patients-with-diabetes-and)

* The association remains significant even when controlling for diet, sunshine exposure, and supplementation  &nbsp; [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32814853/)** Historical Context **Interestingly, there is evidence that the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and dental health was historically downplayed in favor of fluoride treatments, despite clinical trial evidence supporting vitamin D's role in dental health  &nbsp; [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706833/)

#### Maternal Urinary Fluoride and Child Neurobehavior at Age 36 Months (Vit D, Mg not mentioned) - May 2024

JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(5):e2411987. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.11987

Ashley J. Malin, PhD1,2; Sandrah P. Eckel, PhD3; Howard Hu, MD, MPH, ScD3; et alE. Angeles Martinez-Mier, PhD, DDS, MSD4; Ixel Hernandez-Castro, PhD3; Tingyu Yang, MS3; Shohreh F. Farzan, PhD3; Rima Habre, ScD3; Carrie V. Breton, ScD3; Theresa M. Bastain, PhD3

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/maternal-floiride.webp" alt="image" width="600">** Key Points *** Question  Is prenatal fluoride exposure associated with child neurobehavior in a US-based sample?

* Findings  In this cohort study of 229 pregnant women and their children, a 0.68 mg/L (ie, 1 IQR) increase in specific gravity–adjusted maternal urinary fluoride during pregnancy was associated with nearly double the odds of T scores for total child neurobehavioral problems being in the borderline clinical or clinical range.

* Meaning  These findings suggest that prenatal fluoride exposure may increase risk of neurobehavioral problems among children living in an optimally fluoridated area in the US.** Abstract **Importance  Recent studies in Canadian and Mexican populations suggest an association of higher prenatal fluoride exposure with poorer neurobehavioral development, but whether this association holds for US-based populations is unknown.

Objective  To examine associations of third trimester maternal urinary fluoride (MUF) with child neurobehavior at age 3 years in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This prospective cohort study utilized urine samples archived from 2017 to 2020 and neurobehavioral data assessed from 2020 to 2023 from the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) pregnancy cohort, which consisted of predominately Hispanic women residing in Los Angeles, California. Cohort eligibility criteria at recruitment included being 18 years of age or older, less than 30 weeks’ gestation, and a fluent English or Spanish speaker. Exclusion criteria included having a disability preventing participation or provision of informed consent, being HIV positive or incarcerated, and having a multiple gestation pregnancy. There were 263 mother-child pairs who completed the 3-year study visit. In this analysis, women who reported prenatal smoking were excluded. Data analysis was conducted from October 2022 to March 2024.

Exposure  Specific gravity-adjusted MUF (MUFSG), a biomarker of prenatal fluoride exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Neurobehavior was quantified using the Preschool Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which included composite scores for Total Problems, Internalizing Problems, and Externalizing Problems. CBCL composite T scores range from 28 to 100. T scores from 60 to 63 are in the borderline clinical range, whereas scores above 63 are in the clinical range. Linear and logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were conducted.

Results  A total of 229 mother-child pairs (mean <span>[SD]</span> maternal age, 29.45 <span>[5.67]</span> years; 116 female children <span>[50.7%]</span> and 113 male children <span>[49.3%]</span>) who had MUFSG measured were included in the study. Median (IQR) MUFSG was 0.76 (0.51-1.19) mg/L, and 32 participants (14.0%) had a Total Problems T score in the borderline clinical or clinical range.** A 1-IQR (0.68 mg/L) increase in MUFSG was associated with nearly double the odds of the Total Problems T score being in the borderline clinical or clinical range **(odds ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.86; P = .008), as well as with a 2.29-point increase in T score for the Internalizing Problems composite (B = 2.29; 95% CI, 0.47-4.11; P = .01) and a 2.14-point increase in T score for the Total Problems composite (B = 2.14; 95% CI, 0.29-3.98; P = .02).

Conclusions and Relevance  In this prospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in Los Angeles, California, prenatal fluoride exposure was associated with increased neurobehavioral problems. These findings suggest that there may be a need to establish recommendations for limiting fluoride exposure during the prenatal period.
