Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the major cause of dementia worldwide, is characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognition. The sporadic form of AD accounts for nearly 90% of the patients developing this disease. The last century has witnessed significant research to identify various mechanisms and risk factors contributing to the complex etiopathogenesis of AD by analyzing postmortem AD brains and experimenting with animal and cell culture based models. However, the treatment strategies, as of now, are only symptomatic. Accumulating evidences suggested a significant association between vitamin D deficiency, dementia, and AD. This review encompasses the beneficial role of vitamin D in neurocognition and optimal brain health along with epidemiological evidence of the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among aged and AD population. Moreover, disrupted signaling, altered utilization of vitamin D, and polymorphisms of several related genes including  **vitamin D receptor**  (VDR) also predispose to AD or AD-like neurodegeneration. 

This review explores the relationship between this gene-environmental influence and long term vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for development of sporadic AD along with the role and rationale of therapeutic trials with vitamin D. It is, therefore, urgently warranted to further establish the role of this potentially neuroprotective vitamin in preventing and halting progressive neurodegeneration in AD patients.

* Despite several experimental in vivo or in vitro models of AD explaining its molecular pathogenesis which have led to different types of drug treatment strategies and tests in animal and cell-based models and in clinical trials, the treatment of AD in general is terribly inadequate at present. 

* A 7-year follow-up study by Annweiler et al. confirms that higher vitamin D dietary intake was associated with lower risk of developing AD among older women <sup>[94]</sup>. 

* The AD-IDEA trial, a randomized placebo- controlled trial, was the first of such trials, on the effectiveness of vitamin D in ADRD patients <sup>[118]</sup>.

* The trial of vitamin D alone or in combination with other agents/anti-AD drugs have shown positive results in some recent works. Fiala and Mizwicki have shown that combined use of vitamin D3 and DHA . . . 

* In contrast, one randomized control by Stein et al. showed that neither cognition nor disability changed significantly after high-dose vitamin D in mild to moderately severe AD cases <sup>[121]</sup>

> ~~#00F:Note by VitaminDWiki: the study used less than 6,000 IU  **D2**  for only 8 weeks, and kept vitamin D levels < 70 ng.  

> Suspect far more Vitamin D is needed when the Vitamin D genes partially block the Vitamin D getting to the cells

* (from conclusion) However, it is worth noting that a very recent study has identified vitamin D  **binding protein**  to be a potential blood biomarker for the diagnosis of AD <sup>[125]</sup>.However, further verification with larger epidemiological and molecular evidences is eagerly awaited before targeting DBP as a possible therapeutic modulation in AD.
