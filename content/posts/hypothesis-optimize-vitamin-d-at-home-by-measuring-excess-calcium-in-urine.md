### It is difficult to determine [how much](/tags/how-much.html) vitamin D an individual needs

### Need to add vitamin D for each of the following reasons

### Even within the same risk group the vitamin D needed will vary by 4X

According to [Dr. Vieth - May 2011](/tags/dr-vieth-may-2011.html) (see charts below) the body starts dumping calcium via the urine long before serum levels of calcium become elevated.

 **Hypothesis:**  The body starts exponentially dumping calcium via the urine would at the top of the personal optimal serum vitamin D range.  

Thus we can interpret the urine dump of calcium as a precursor to the optimal D range.

### Calcium increases in urine before increasing in blood if too much vitamin D - Veith

### Calcium/Creatinine ratio in urine vs vitamin D - Veith

OBJECTIVE:To characterize the effect of vitamin D(3) intake on urinary calcium:creatinine ratios across predefined ranges of serum 25(OH)D.

DESIGN:Patients with multiple sclerosis (n=25) received escalating doses of vitamin D(3) (4000-40,000IU/d) with calcium (1200mg/d).

RESULTS: Urinary calcium:creatinine was driven by increased 25(OH)D when concentrations were <75nmol/L (r=0.424, p=0.009) and >200nmol/L (r=0.281, p=0.01), but no relationship existed when 25(OH)D concentrations were 76-200nmol/L.

CONCLUSIONS: A "safe", physiological range of 25(OH)D concentrations is 75-200nmol/L.

## Low-cost test for Calcium in the urine

#### Sulkowitch Urine (Calcium) Test  – see attached PDF – very low cost ($1.30 per test) and can do at home

#### [10 tests for $10 + shipping](https://osumex.com/order.php) most anywhere in the world

 **Test is very simple - but will have to guess conversion between units on the graph and turbidity**
