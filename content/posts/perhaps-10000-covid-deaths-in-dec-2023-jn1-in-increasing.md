* "There was a 42% increase in hospitalizations   
and a 62% increase in ICU admissions from the previous month"

* "Trends are based on data reported to the WHO from fewer than 50 countries, mostly in Europe and the Americas, said Tedros, who noted that  **this is not the full picture** ."

* "The new dominant variant appears to be  **much more adept than earlier ones at infecting**  those who are vaccinated or who have been previously infected, The Washington Post reported"
