Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to cardiovascular disease and risk factors including hypertension. The authors sought to determine prevalence rates of hypertension in adults tested for 25-hydroxyvitamin D categorized by their levels and evaluate odds ratios for hypertension at lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared with optimal levels. 

A cross-sectional study was conducted January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006, of patients aged 18?years and older within a large ethnically diverse population. Diagnosis of hypertension was determined by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems codes. 

Patients were categorized into quartiles according to 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: ideal (?40?ng/mL), adequate (30-39?ng/mL), deficient (15-29 ng/mL), and severely deficient (<15?ng/mL). Prevalence rates of hypertension and odds ratios were calculated for each 25-hydroxyvitamin D quartile, adjusting for age, sex, race, and renal insufficiency. 

A total of 2722 individuals met the inclusion criteria for the study. The overall prevalence of hypertension in the study population was 24%. 

Hypertension rates were 52%, 41%, 27%, and 20% in 25-hydroxyvitamin D quartiles <15?ng/mL, 15 to 29?ng/mL, 30 to 39?ng/mL, and ?40?ng/mL, respectively (P<.001). 

Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for hypertension adjusting for age, sex, race, and renal insufficiency were 2.7 (1.4-5.2), 2.0 (1.5-2.6), and 1.3 (1.2-1.6) for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <15 ng/mL, 15 to 29 ng/mL, and 30 to 39?ng/mL, respectively, compared with the ?40 ng/mL group. 

This study demonstrates increased rates of hypertension in individuals who tested for lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D starting at levels <40 ng/mL. This retrospective analysis raises the question of whether supplementing to optimal vitamin D levels can prevent or improve hypertension.

Vitamin D has been suggested to have an effect on erythropoiesis. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of anemia in a population of individuals with vitamin D deficiency compared with those with normal levels in a population of a large integrated healthplan. A cross-sectional analysis in the period 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2006 of subjects with documented concurrent levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hemoglobin were evaluated. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as <30 ng/mL and anemia was defined as a hemoglobin <11 g/dL. A total of 554 subjects were included in the analysis. Anemia was present in 49% of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-deficient subjects compared with 36% with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (p < 0.01). Odds ratio for anemia in subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency using logistic regressions and controlling for age, gender, and chronic kidney disease was 1.9 (95% CI 1.3-2.7). 25-hydroxyvitamin D-deficient subjects had a lower mean Hb (11.0 vs. 11.7; p = 0.12 ) and a higher prevalence of erythrocyte stimulating agent use (47% vs. 24%; p < 0.05). This study demonstrates an association of vitamin D deficiency and a greater risk of anemia, lower mean hemoglobin, and higher usage of erythrocyte-stimulating agents. Future randomized studies are warranted to examine whether vitamin D directly affects erythropoiesis. PMID: 19841921   [full text on-line](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19841921)
