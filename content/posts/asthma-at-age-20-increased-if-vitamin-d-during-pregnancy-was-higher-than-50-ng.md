 **Compared to 30 to 50 ng of vitamin D** 

80% increased chance of asthma if mother had > 50 ng of vitamin D

70% less risk of asthma hospitalizations if mother had < 20 ng of vitamin D

 **This seems to conflict with previous studies** 

Comments:

* How did the women get such high levels of vitamin D decades ago?

* Was the high vitamin D due to cod-liver oil, which results in high Vitamin A.

* Notice that one of the authors is from Iceland – where cod-liver oil is used.

* Tried to buy a copy of the PDF to investigate, but the publisher’s system had an error

* There is a possibility that the high level of vitamin D during pregnancy programmed the child/adule to expect a lot of vitamin D in the environment, which it did not get. (epigenetics)

BACKGROUND:

High prenatal vitamin D status has been linked to decreased risk of atopic diseases in early childhood, but whether such relations persist until adulthood has not been explored.

OBJECTIVE:

We sought to examine the association between maternal 25-hydryxovitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) concentrations and outcomes of allergic airway disease and lung function in offspring with 20 to 25 years of follow-up.

METHODS:

In a prospective birth cohort with 965 pregnant women enrolled in 1988-1989, maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were quantified in serum from gestational week 30 (n = 850 <span>[88%]</span>). Offspring were followed in nationwide registries with complete follow-up to the age of 25 years (n = 850 <span>[100%]</span>). Additionally, at age 20 years, outcomes of allergic airway disease and lung function were assessed in a subset of offspring by using blood samples and spirometry (n = 410 <span>[45%]</span>) and a questionnaire (n = 641 <span>[70%]</span>).

RESULTS:

Exposure to a high maternal 25(OH)D concentration (≥125 nmol/L) was associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalizations in offspring (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span>, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.78-4.16) during 25 years of follow-up compared with the reference group (75-<125 nmol/L). Furthermore, there were lower risks of asthma hospitalizations (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-1.02) and asthma medication use (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.95) in those exposed to a low maternal 25(OH)D concentration (<50 nmol/L). In a reduced set of participants, we found no associations between maternal 25(OH)D concentrations and offspring allergen-specific IgE, total IgE, and eosinophil cationic protein levels; self-reported doctor's diagnosis of asthma or hay fever; or lung function at 20 years of age.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our study does not provide support for a protective effect of a high maternal 25(OH)D concentration on outcomes of allergic airway disease and lung function at 20 to 25 years of age. In contrast, a high maternal 25(OH)D concentration might be associated with an increased risk of allergic diseases in offspring.
