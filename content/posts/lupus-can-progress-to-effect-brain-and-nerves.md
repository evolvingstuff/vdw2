Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect several organs and systems. The central and/or peripheral nervous system can suffer from complications known as neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE). Studies have associated the manifestations of SLE or NPSLE with vitamin D deficiency. It has been shown that hypovitaminosis D can lead to cognition deficits and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with NPSLE. In this review article, we will address the main features related to vitamin D supplementation or serum vitamin D levels with neuropsychiatric manifestations, either in patients or in animal models of NPSLE.
