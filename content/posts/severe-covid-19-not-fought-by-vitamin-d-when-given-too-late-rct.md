__Most Clinical Trials give Vitamin D upon entering the hospital%%%Participants of this RCT in Brazil had severe COVID-19 %%%Number of days in hospital until the Vitamin D intervention is not specified%%%Possble reasons for Vitamin D not helping include:%%%~~#F00:1)~~ Patients with severe COVID-19 have poor digestion, so less vitamin D into body%%% ~~#F00:2)~~ Difficult to improve the immune system after it is already storming%%%~~#F00:3)~~ Participants all had very low Vitamin D levels__

This was the 4th RCT in VitaminDWiki to report results
Did not see any indication of the elapsed time between intervention and test

__Severe COVID-19 patients might have benefited from faster-acting Vitamin D__
