This chronic condition affects multiple organs and systems, including the skin, blood vessels, muscles, and internal organs like the heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>The exact cause of systemic sclerosis is not well understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors that trigger an abnormal immune response. This immune response leads to inflammation and excessive collagen production, resulting in the fibrosis and thickening of tissues.</p><p>Systemic sclerosis is classified into two main subtypes:</p><ul><li><p>Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc): This subtype primarily affects the skin on the hands, arms, face, and legs. It progresses more slowly and is generally associated with a better prognosis.</p></li><li><p>Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc): This subtype is more severe, as it affects not only the skin but also internal organs. It progresses more rapidly and can cause significant complications.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Symptoms of systemic sclerosis may include:</strong></p><p>Skin thickening, hardening, and tightness</p><p>Raynaud&rsquo;s phenomenon (extremities turning blue or white in response to cold or stress)</p><p>Joint pain and stiffness</p><p>Muscle weakness</p><p>Fatigue</p><p>Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., acid reflux, difficulty swallowing)</p><p>Shortness of breath and pulmonary issues</p><p>Kidney problems</p><p>Heart complications</p><p>Diagnosis typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, blood tests (to detect specific autoantibodies), and imaging studies to assess internal organ involvement. Treatment options may include medications to manage symptoms and slow disease progression, physical therapy, and, in some cases, immunosuppressive drugs. As systemic sclerosis can be a complex and potentially life-threatening condition, it is crucial for patients to receive ongoing care and monitoring from a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamindwiki-sometimes-autoimmune-diseases-generate-vitamin-d-antibodies---jan-2025postssometimes-autoimmune-diseases-generate-vitamin-d-antibodies>VitaminDWiki: <a href=/posts/sometimes-autoimmune-diseases-generate-vitamin-d-antibodies>Sometimes Autoimmune diseases generate Vitamin D antibodies - Jan 2025</a></h4><hr><h4 id=systemic-sclerosis-and-vitamin-d-meta-analysis---oct-2024>Systemic Sclerosis and vitamin D meta-analysis - Oct 2024</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D association with systemic sclerosis and its clinical features: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression</strong></p><p>Journal of Scleroderma and Related Disorders <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/23971983241288591>61 references, PDF behind paywall</a></p><p>Tarak Dhaouadi <a href=mailto:dhaouaditarak@yahoo.fr>dhaouaditarak@yahoo.fr</a>, Awatef Riahi,&mldr;</p><p>Objectives:</p><p>The aim of this review was to summarize existing data on the contribution of Vitamin D level and/or deficiency/insufficiency to systemic sclerosis susceptibility and its clinical features.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>An electronic literature search for eligible studies among all papers published prior to 30 June 2024 was conducted through PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune condition defined by a complex pathobiology, comprising excessive fibrosis of skin and internal organs, peripheral vasculopathy with endothelial cell dysfunction, inadequate vascular repair and neovascularization, and aberrant immunity. Vitamin D is a steroid hormone with pleiotropic effects beyond its traditional role in calcium and bone homeostasis. Since vitamin D has immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, and antifibrotic properties, it could potentially interfere with SSc pathogenesis. Suboptimal vitamin D levels are classically recognized in scleroderma, irrespective of clinical and serological phenotype. Aim. This systematic review is aimed at investigating and clarifying the role of vitamin D in SSc and emphasizing the association of vitamin D status with different clinical settings.</p><p>Methods and Results. A systematic online search was performed, using PubMed databases to collect articles on the topic of vitamin D in SSc. The final analysis included 40 eligible articles.</p><p>Conclusions. Hypovitaminosis D is common in SSc patients and could be associated with clinical and serologic patterns of the disease.

We investigated the 25-OH-vitamin D (25-OH-vitD) levels in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, in correlation with disease’s features. We measured the 25-OH-vitD serum levels in 140 consecutive patients (F/M 126/15; mean age 61 ± 15.1 years), 91 without (group A ) and 49 with (group B ) 25-OH-cholecalciferol supplementation. Patients of group A invariably showed low 25-OH-vitD levels <strong>(9.8 ± 4.1 ng/ml vs. 26 ± 8.1 ng/ml</strong> of group B ); in particular, 88/91 <strong><span style=color:#00f>(97%)</span> patients showed vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/ml),</strong> with very low vitamin D levels (&lt;10 ng/ml) in 40 (44%) subjects. Only 15/49 (30.6%) patients of group B reached normal levels of 25-OH-vitD (=30 ng/ml), whereas vitamin D deficiency persisted in 12/49 (24.5%) individuals. Parathormone levels inversely correlated with 25-OH-vitD (r = -0.3, p &lt; 0.0001). Of interest, hypovitaminosis D was statistically associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (p = 0.008), while calcinosis was more frequently observed in patients of group A (p = 0.057). Moreover, we found significantly higher percentage of serum anticentromere antibodies in group B patients with 25-OH-vitD level =30 ng/ml (8/15 vs. 6/34; p = 0.017).</p><p>In literature, hypovitaminosis D is very frequent in SSc patients. An association with disease duration, calcinosis, or severity of pulmonary involvement was occasionally recognized. Hypovitaminosis D is very frequent in SSc and severe in a relevant percentage of patients; furthermore, less than one third of supplemented subjects reached normal levels of 25-OH-vitD. The evaluation of 25-OH-vitD levels should be included in the routine clinical work-up of SSc. The above findings expand previous observations and may stimulate further investigations.</p><p><strong><a href=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10067-016-3535-z>Publisher wants $40 for the PDF, but the references online are free</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=systemic-sclerosis-and-low-vitamin-d--june-2016>Systemic sclerosis and low vitamin D – June 2016</h4><p><strong>Low vitamin D status in systemic sclerosis and the impact on disease phenotype.</strong></p><p>Eur J Rheumatol. 2016 Jun;3(2):50-55.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of vitamin D in patients with systemic sclerosis and to analyze the associations between the concentration of vitamin D and the features of systemic sclerosis.</p><p>MATERIAL AND METHODS:</p><p>Fifty-one consecutive patients were evaluated for visceral involvement, immunological profile, activity, severity scores, and quality of life. The vitamin D status was evaluated by measuring the 25hydroxy-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>The mean vitamin D level was 17.06±9.13 ng/dL. Only 9.8% of the patients had optimal vitamin D levels; 66.66% of them had insufficient 25(OH)D levels, while 23.52% had deficient levels.</p><p>No correlation was found between vitamin D concentration and age, sex, autoantibody profile, extent of skin involvement, or vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D levels were correlated with the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (p=0.019, r=0.353), diastolic dysfunction (p=0.033, r=-0.318), digital contractures (p=0.036, r=-0.298), and muscle weakness (p=0.015, r=-0.377) and had a trend for negative correlation with pulmonary hypertension (p=0.053, r=-0.29).</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Low levels of vitamin D are very common in systemic sclerosis.

Peripheral vascular (p = 0.03), kidney (p = 0.02), gastrointestinal (p = 0.05) Medsger&rsquo;s DSS parameters were found to correlate with 25(OH)D serum concentrations. No significant correlations were observed with digital ulcers incidence, strictly correlated to patterns of microangiopathy, defined at NVC analysis (p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, no effects of treatment with oral colecalciferol (Dibase <strong>1,000 IU daily for at least 6 month</strong> s) were found on 25(OH)D serum concentrations in treated (18.8 ±10 ng/ml) or untreated (18.7 ±9 ng/ml) SSc patients (p = 0.81). A significant difference was observed among seasonal 25(OH)D serum concentrations (winter: 14.6 ±7.8 ng/ml, spring: 17.2 ±7.9 ng/ml, summer: 21.43 ±10 ng/ml, autumn: 20.2 ±10 ng/ml; p = 0.032) in all patients.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D deficiency was found to correlate with lung involvement, peripheral vascular, kidney and gastrointestinal Medsger&rsquo;s DSS parameters and with seasonality In SSc patients. Supplementation with oral colecalciferol was found not effective in increasing 25(OH)D serum concentrations. Therefore, for successful replacement, supra-physiological vitamin D3 doses or programmed UVB light exposure should be tested.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/systemic-sclerosis-plos.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=raynauds--systemic-sclerosis-gi-etc---2016>Raynaud’s ==> Systemic Sclerosis, GI, etc - 2016</h4><p><a href=http://sclerodermanews.com/2016/10/13/systemic-sclerosis-patients-with-raynauds-syndrome-often-develop-other-conditions>Many Systemic Sclerosis Patients with Raynaud’s Syndrome Soon Develop Other Conditions</a> Oct 2016</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Of the initial 9,891 SSc patients followed during the EUSTAR study, 695 patients with a median age of 52.7 years had a baseline visit within one year after Raynaud’s onset, and developed skin sclerosis (75%); GI symptoms (71%); impaired diffusing capacity for monoxide below 80% (65%); DU (34%); cardiac involvement (32%); FVC below 80% (31%); increased PAPsys (14%); and renal crisis (3%).&rdquo;</li></ul><hr><h4 id=see-also-vitamindwiki>See also VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/rare-diseases-hit-fewer-than-1-in-1500-people-but-1-in-12-people-have-a-rare-dis-in-might-d-help>Rare diseases hit fewer than 1 in 1500 people, but 1 in 12 people have a rare disease (vitamin might D help)</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/sclerodoma-and-vitamin-d-deficiency>Sclerodoma and vitamin D deficiency</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/autoimmune-disease-clusters-run-in-families-polyautoimmunity-are-associated-with-low-vitamin-d>Autoimmune disease clusters run in families (polyautoimmunity) are associated with low vitamin D</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=11900-studies-of-systemic-sclerosis-vitamin-d--in-google-scholar-as-of-march-2025>11,900 studies of &ldquo;Systemic Sclerosis&rdquo; &ldquo;vitamin d&rdquo; in Google Scholar as of March 2025</h4><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=%22Systemic+Sclerosis%22+%22vitamin+d%22&amp;btnG=%20">Google Scholar</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-also-web>See also web</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=http://www.scleroderma.org>http://www.scleroderma.org</a></strong></li></ul><blockquote><p>“The word “scleroderma” comes from two Greek words: “sclero” meaning hard, and “derma” meaning skin.
