## <a href="/posts/the-institute-of-medicine" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1193">The Institute of Medicine</a> proposed 20 ng/ml in Nov 2010]

# Dr. Veith presented an interesting hypothesis in May 2011

## Some people (Caucasians?) living in high latitudes (which have a large variation in UV during the year)

## get adverse reactions to high (50 ng+) levels of vitamin D for the entire year

## It MIGHT be OK to have higher levels during the summer.

## The data only hints that having > 50NG/ml all year long might be a problem
