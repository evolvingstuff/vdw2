Background

Alopecia areata (AA) is a hair follicle‐specific autoimmune disorder. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with various autoimmune disorders for its immunomodulatory effects. However, in previous studies, there had been inconsistent association found between AA and vitamin D deficiency.

Objective: To demonstrate the differences of the mean serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D level and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency between AA subjects and non‐AA controls.

Methods: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational studies on AA and serum vitamin D levels and/or prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was performed searching MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases.

Results

In all, 14 studies including a total of 1,255 AA subjects and 784 non‐AA control were analyzed. The mean serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D level was significantly lower in AA subjects (‐8.52 ng/dL; 95% confidential interval; ‐5.50 to ‐11.53). The subjects with AA had higher odds of vitamin D deficiency of vitamin D deficiency (odds of 3.55; 2.03 to 6.20, mean prevalence of 75.5%; 60.8 to 86.0%). However, it was difficult to find clear correlation between serum 25‐hydroxyvtamin D level and extent of hair loss in AA.

Conclusion

The AA subjects had lower serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D level and vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent compared to non‐AA controls. Hence, Vitamin D deficiency should be assessed in AA patients. Furthermore, nutritional supplementation of vitamin D or topical vitamin D analogues can be considered for AA patients with vitamin D deficiency. The limitation of this study is the highly heterogeneity of the included studies.
