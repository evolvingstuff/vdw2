# [Report Finds Most Errors at Hospitals Go Unreported](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/health/study-of-medicare-patients-finds-most-hospital-errors-unreported.html%20) New York Times

## " . . estimated that more than 130,000 Medicare beneficiaries experienced one or more adverse events in hospitals in a single month.”

## Adverse events include

* medication errors, 

* severe bedsores, 

* infections that patients acquire in hospitals, 

* delirium resulting from overuse of painkillers and 

* excessive bleeding linked to improper use of blood thinners.

## Reasons for not reporting the error included:

* employees do not recognize “what constitutes patient harm” 

* do not realize that particular events harmed patients 

* employees assumed someone else would report the episode

* they thought it was so common that it did not need to be reported

* “suspected that the events were isolated incidents unlikely to recur.”
