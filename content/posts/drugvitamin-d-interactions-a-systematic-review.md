Extensive media coverage of the potential health benefits of vitamin D supplementation has translated into substantial increases in supplement sales over recent years. Yet, the potential for drug–vitamin D interactions is rarely considered. This systematic review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the extent to which drugs affect vitamin D status or supplementation alters drug effectiveness or toxicity in humans. Electronic databases were used to identify eligible peer-reviewed studies published  **through September 1, 2010** . Study characteristics and findings were abstracted, and quality was assessed for each study. 

A total of 109 unique reports met the inclusion criteria. 

The majority of eligible studies were classified as class

* C (nonrandomized trials, case-control studies, or time series) or 

* D (cross-sectional, trend, case report/series, or before-and-after studies). 

> &nbsp; &nbsp;Only 2 class C and 3 class D studies were of positive quality. 

 **Insufficient evidence**  was available to determine whether 

* lipase inhibitors, 

* antimicrobial agents, 

* antiepileptic drugs, 

* highly active antiretroviral agents, or 

* H2 receptor antagonists 

> &nbsp; &nbsp;alter serum 25(OH)D concentrations. 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">{However,}</span>** 

* Atorvastatin appears to increase 25(OH)D concentrations, whereas 

* concurrent vitamin D supplementation decreases concentrations of atorvastatin. 

* Use of thiazide diuretics in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplements 

> &nbsp; &nbsp;may cause hypercalcemia in the elderly or those with compromised renal function or hyperparathyroidism. 

Larger studies with stronger study designs are needed to clarify potential drug–vitamin D interactions, 

 **especially for drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)** .

Healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for drug–vitamin D interactions.
