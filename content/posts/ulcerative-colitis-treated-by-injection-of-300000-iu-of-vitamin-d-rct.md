#### Ulcerative Colitis  reduced by half with probiotic [VSL #3](https://www.amazon.com/Potency-Probiotic-Capsules-Ulcerative-Colitis/dp/B0014R4RZW/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1506282762&sr=8-1&keywords=VLS%233%20)

From C o nsumer LABS Sept 2017

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in countries such as South Korea and Canada currently recommend against the use of probiotics for treatment and/or to induce or maintain "complete remission" ([Choi, Intest Res 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5323310/%20) <span>[free PDF]</span>; Bressler, [Gastroenterology 2015](http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(15)00303-0/fulltext#sec3.5.7%20) <span>[free PDF]</span>). These positions were taken despite an analysis showing that three randomized, controlled trials among people with active ulcerative colitis receiving standard medications found that those who took the probiotic VSL #3 (3.6 trillion cells daily) for an average of 3 months had a higher remission rate compared to those who took placebo (43.8% vs. 24.8%, respectively) ([Mardini Inflamm Bowel Dis 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918321%20)). The American Gastroenterological Association has not issued an official guideline on the use of probiotics for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, but plans on releasing one in the spring of 2019
