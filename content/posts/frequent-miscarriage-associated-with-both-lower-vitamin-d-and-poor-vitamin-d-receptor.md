Immunological mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the pathogenesis of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). Vitamin D has a potent immunomodulatory effect, which may affect pregnancy outcome. The objective of this study was to investigate 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> concentration and vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in the decidual tissues of RSA patients. Thirty women with RSA (RSA group) and thirty women undergoing elective abortion (control group) were recruited during 2016 from gynecology outpatient clinics. We measured 25(OH) D, interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), VDR and 1-α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) in decidual tissues collected during the abortion procedure. In the RSA group, 25(OH) D and TGF-β were significantly decreased while IL-17 and IL-23 were significantly increased compared with the control group. 

VDR expression was significantly decreased in the RSA group compared with the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between 25(OH) D in decidual tissues and RSA. These results indicated that vitamin D concentrations in the decidua are associated with inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting that vitamin D and VDR may play a role in the etiology of RSA.
