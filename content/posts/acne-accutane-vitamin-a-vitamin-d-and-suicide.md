#### Report of increased suicides in patients taking Accutane to reduce acne (128 of 5,700)

http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/news/20101111/severe-acne-raises-suicide-risk-study-finds 

#### Many previous reports on the internet of Accutane causing dental problems  [CLICK HERE for example](http://www.topix.com/forum/drug/accutane/TFK9IFHR6UE7CUGHL)

* [Accutane is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin A](http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/accutane.html)

> Vitamin A is an antagonist for Vitamin D - that is, vitamin A reduces the amount of vitamin D in the body

### So it appears

#### acne==> use accutane  ==> many dental cavities, birth defects, depression, and suicide

#### which are all associated with very low levels of vitamin D

#### Another [Vitamin D Council newsletter](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/newsletter/2008-october.shtml) had the following comment

#### A person who had taken vitamin D for diabetes and found that in addition to losing weight that the acne went away

I have had some reports that vitamin D cured acne but frankly, I didn't believe them. Then I ran across this 1938 paper entitled Vitamin D in Acne: A Comparison with X-Ray Treatment (PDF format). You can read the entire paper yourself and see what 5,000–14,000 IU per day did for these patients with severe acne. When I was a kid, I always wondered why my pimples got better in the summer and worse in the winter.

* [Vitamin A may thwart the ability of vitamin D to reduce risk of osteoporosis – June 2010](/posts/vitamin-a-may-thwart-the-ability-of-vitamin-d-to-reduce-risk-of-osteoporosis)

This same concept was confirmed 3 days later on Nov 16 by [FoodConsumer](http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite/Nutrition/Vitamins/acne_drug_may_boost_suicide_risk_1611101226.html)

#### Update from [FoodConsumer May 2011](http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite/Non-food/Disease/the_root_cause_of_acne_0531110631.html)
