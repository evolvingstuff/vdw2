Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, results in a sustained decline in cognition. There are currently few effective disease modifying therapies for AD, but insights into the mechanisms that mediate the onset and progression of disease may lead to new, effective therapeutic strategies. Amyloid beta oligomers and plaques, tau aggregates, and neuroinflammation play a critical role in neurodegeneration and impact clinical AD progression. The upstream modulators of these pathological features have not been fully clarified, but recent evidence indicates that the gut microbiome (GMB) may have an influence on these features and therefore may influence AD progression in human patients. 

In this review, we summarize studies that have identified alterations in the GMB that correlate with pathophysiology in AD patients and AD mouse models. 

Additionally, we discuss findings with GMB manipulations in AD models and potential GMB-targeted therapeutics for AD. 

Lastly, we discuss diet, sleep, and exercise as potential modifiers of the relationship between the GMB and AD and conclude with future directions and recommendations for further studies of this topic.
