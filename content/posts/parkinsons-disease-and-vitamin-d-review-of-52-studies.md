Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid, traditionally considered a key regulator of bone metabolism, calcium and phosphorous homeostasis. Its action is made possible through the binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), after which it directly and indirectly modulates the expression of thousands of genes. Vitamin D is important for brain development, mature brain activity and associated with many neurological diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). 

High frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients with Parkinson’s disease compared to control population was noted nearly twenty years ago. This finding is of interest given vitamin D’s neuroprotective effect, exerted by the action of neurotrophic factors, regulation of nerve growth or through protection against cytotoxicity. 

Vitamin D deficiency seems to be related to disease severity and disease progression, evaluated by Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale, but not with age of PD onset and duration of disease. 

Additionally, fall risk has been associated with lower vitamin D levels in PD. However, while the association between vitamin D and motor-symptoms seems to be possible, results of studies investigating the association with non-motor symptoms are conflicting. In addition, very little evidence exists regarding the possibility to use vitamin D supplementation to reduce clinical manifestations and disability in patients with PD. 

However, considering the positive balance between potential benefits against its limited risks, vitamin D supplementation for PD patients will probably be considered in the near future, if further confirmed in clinical studies.

##### Summary from PDF

In summary, as low serum 25(OH)D levels might be correlated with an increased risk of developing PD, higher 25(OH)D levels seems to be associated with better motor symptoms, especially with improved balance control. It is not yet clear if vitamin D is related to the severity of symptoms of PD and with clinical progression; therefore, its role as disease progression biomarker for PD is not yet clear. Further studies are needed to establish the role of vitamin D etiology of PD, and its relationship with motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life and progression of disease.

It is not yet proven if vitamin D reintegration could be an appropriate support to pharmacological and rehabilitative therapy in PD patients. However, though insufficient evidence is available to introduce vitamin D as supportive therapy in PD patients, con­sidering its limited risks, we are confident enough to insinuate, as a dietary intervention, that vitamin D supplementation would act at three different levels: 

* (1) improve public health considering its possible role in brain development and its influence in pathogenesis of many neurological disorders, including PD;

* (2) slowing down the worsening of some PD symptoms; 

* (3) finally, considering the increased risk of falls during disease progression, reduce the risk of fracture in PD patients.
