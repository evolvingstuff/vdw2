The German Nutrition Society published new estimated requirements for daily vitamin D intake 

For all age groups  **beyond infancy** , a daily intake of 20 µg is recommended in case of absent UV-B-exposure. 

With respect to the prevention of vitamin D deficiency (25<span>[OH]</span>D < 30 nmol/l) this is a clear progress compared to the former recommendation of 5 µg per day.

Research results in recent years provided evidence for a role of vitamin D for the prevention of several chronic diseases. A working group of the German Society for Nutrition Association (DGE) has evaluated the scientific data on this. Current evidence clearly confirms that a good vitamin D intake may reduce the risk in older people for falls, fractures, loss of strength, mobility and balance loss, and premature death. Hypotheses such as a reduction in risk for cancer or diabetes mellitus with vitamin D could not be proved.

In Germany, there are approximately 60% of the population according to international criteria, insufficient vitamin D supply. 

For them, the marker is for the supply in the blood, the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), below the desired value of 50 nmol / l. 

To achieve this concentration in the blood indicates the DGE as a new reference value for vitamin D intake, assuming a lack of endogenous formation of 20 micrograms vitamin D per day. 

About the diet with the usual food take young people and adults 2-4 micrograms vitamin D per day. 

The difference between the intake of food and the appraised value in the absence of endogenous formation must be covered by the vitamin D formation in skin and / or through the ingestion of a vitamin D preparation. For frequent outdoor exercise, especially during physical activity outdoors and uncovered skin with sufficient parts, the desired vitamin D supply without taking a vitamin D supplements can be achieved.

# 200 IU ==> 800 IU beyond infancy

A good step in the right direction - a long ways to go, especially for those with dark skins
