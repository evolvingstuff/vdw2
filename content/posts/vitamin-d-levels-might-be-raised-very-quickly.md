#### Quickly raising Vitamin D levels has been proven to  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save lives, &nbsp; &nbsp; Reduce pain, &nbsp; &nbsp; Reduce ICU & hospital time/costs

 **Proven ways which take 2 days & possible ways which might take 2 hours** 

 **Injection** 

Proven to raise vitamin D levels in 2 days with a single injection of standard vitamin D into muscle

Possibly faster if inject into multiple locations at the same time

Possibly faster if inject multiple times over a 3 day period

Possibly faster if inject near to trauma location (exploiting local paracrine and autocrine activation)

 **Intravenous - possible** 

Inject directly into blood (should be faster than injection into the muscle)

 **Oral Loading dose** 

[Proven to raise Vitamin D levels in 3-5 days](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d)

[150,000 IU seem to respond in 1 day](/posts/response-to-150000-iu-vitamin-d-once-vs-5000-iu-daily-rct)

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

 **Topical loading dose near trauma site** 

Vitamin D is quickly absorbed thru the skin and becomes activated locally, without needing liver and kidney

Apply as a spray or liquid

DMSO might speed it up

Nanoemulsion appears to be good

 **Sublingual loading dose** 

20-30 sprays of 6,000 IU per spray - under the tongue, inside cheek

Standard form - nanoemulsion may be much faster

 **Which form should be used when?** 

Oil-based and Water-based forms probably have similar response times

Semi-activated (Calcidiol) - probably get benefits sooner - perhaps 12 hours

* [Calcifediol soft capsules](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10525018B2/en) US Patent application]

* <img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/calcifediol-response-time.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

* Note: In many countries Calcidiol is available only by prescription - which can take many days

Fully-activated (Calcitriol)- probably get benefits sooner

* probable prescription delay as above

Nanoemulsion swished in the mouth or topical appears to create a response in just a few hours

 **Magnesium might speed-up the healing** 

The body requires [Magnesium during 8 stages of Vitamin D processing](/posts/magnesium-is-needed-by-vitamin-d-in-8-places-2013)

Having an adequate level of Magnesium might speed up processing

A majority of people are low in both Magnesium and Vitamin D

Magnesium injections have been routine in hospitals for decades

Should consider giving Magnesium as an injection or orally when getting emergency Vitamin D

 **Non-emergency - raise the vitamin D level in a week or so** 

[Scheduled surgery](/posts/trauma-and-surgery)

Chronic pain/health problem which wants to be treated in days, not months

[Pregnancy](/posts/ensure-a-healthy-pregnancy-and-infant-with-as-little-as-20-of-vitamin-d) - many fetal deaths and infant problems can be avoided if have good level of vitamin D during the 1st trimester, vsthe  2nd trimester

 **Future? spray vitamin D during surgery** 

I anticipate that Vitamin D will be applied to many body tissues in future surgeries

As of 2017 topical Vitamin D has improved tooth transplants in dogs

Future: Other transplants, spinal cord surgery, wounds, sutures, bone healing. . . 

&nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps even have suture thread covered with Vitamin D
