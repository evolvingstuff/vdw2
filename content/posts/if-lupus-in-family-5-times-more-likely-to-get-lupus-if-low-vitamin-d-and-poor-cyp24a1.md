OBJECTIVE:

We examined whether measures of vitamin D were associated with transitioning to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in individuals at risk for SLE.

METHODS:

 **436 individuals who reported having a relative with SLE but who did not have SLE themselves**  were evaluated at baseline and again an average of 6.3 (±3.9) years later. Fifty-six individuals transitioned to SLE (=4 cumulative American College of Rheumatology criteria). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were measured by ELISA. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in four vitamin D genes were genotyped. Generalised estimating equations, adjusting for correlation within families, were used to test associations between the vitamin D variables and the outcome of transitioning to SLE.

RESULTS:

Mean baseline 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels (p=0.42) and vitamin D supplementation (p=0.65) were not different between those who did and did not transition to SLE. 

Vitamin D deficiency (25<span>[OH]</span>D <20 ng/mL) was greater in those who transitioned compared with those who did not transition to SLE (46% vs 33%, p=0.05). 

The association between 25<span>[OH]</span>D and SLE was modified by CYP24A1 rs4809959, where for each additional minor allele increased 25<span>[OH]</span>D was associated with decreased SLE risk: zero minor alleles (adjusted OR: 1.03, CI 0.98 to 1.09), one minor allele (adjusted OR: 1.01, CI 0.97 to 1.05) and two minor alleles (adjusted OR: 0.91, CI 0.84 to 0.98). Similarly, vitamin D deficiency significantly increased the risk of transitioning to SLE in those with two minor alleles at rs4809959 (adjusted  **OR: 4.90** , CI 1.33 to 18.04).

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D status and CYP24A1 may have a combined role in the transition to SLE in individuals at increased genetic risk for SLE.
