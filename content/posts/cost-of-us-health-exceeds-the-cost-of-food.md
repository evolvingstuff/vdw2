#### Looking at the previous two charts, we see

~~#F00:||Year|Food as % of  
  Disposable income| Health care as   
 % of GDP|Cost of   
 Health care vs. food

1970 |14 %| 6 %|Health care = 0.4X of food

2009|10 %|16 %|Health care = 1.6X of food ||~~

 **The cross-over point was about 1990, when both were 12 %** 

Note: Disposable personal income = about 73% of GDP (average) for that time period [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2011/tables/11s0672.pdf)
