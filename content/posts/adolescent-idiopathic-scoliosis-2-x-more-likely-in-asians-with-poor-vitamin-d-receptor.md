#### Vitamin D receptor problems increases risk of AIS by 2X to 3X in Asians - Meta-analysis Jan 2018

 **Association of vitamin D receptor BsmI rs1544410 and ApaI rs7975232 polymorphisms with susceptibility to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.** 

Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Jan;97(2):e9627. [doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009627](https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000009627)

BACKGROUND:

AIS is the most common spinal deformity disease, yet its etiology remains uncertain. Significant associations have been found between AIS risk and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms; however, some of these results are controversial. The aim of this study was to determine whether VDR BsmI rs1544410 and ApaI rs7975232 polymorphisms are correlated with AIS.

METHODS:

Databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Wanfang Database, were systematically searched, and eligible case-control studies that explored the association of VDR (BsmI and ApaI) and the susceptibility to AIS were selected. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated to assess the associations, and subgroup meta-analyses were performed according to the ethnicity of the study population.

RESULTS:

A total of 5 studies with 717 cases and 554 controls fulfilled the inclusion criteria after assessment by 2 reviewers. Generally, significant correlations were found between the BsmI polymorphism and AIS risk in overall populations and in Asian populations (overall population: B vs b:OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.21-3.75, P = .009; BB vs bb: OR = 3.38, 95% CI = 1.08-10.57, P = .036; Bb vs bb: OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.29-4.82, P = .006; BB/Bb vs bb: OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.31-5.63, P = .007; Asian population: B vs b: OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.27-4.61, P = .007; BB vs bb: OR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.03-16.22, P = .045; Bb vs bb: OR =  2.94, 95% CI = 1.42-6.10, P = .004; BB/Bb vs bb: OR = 3.23, 95% CI = 1.42-7.35, P = .005). There was no significant association observed in Caucasian populations (all P > .05). With regard to the ApaI polymorphism, we found that it significantly decreased the risk of AIS (Aa vs AA: OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.24-0.77, P = .004; Aa/aa vs AA: OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30-0.91, P = .023); however, we could not draw a definitive conclusion for Caucasian populations, as no studies have been conducted in this group to determine the role of the VDR ApaI polymorphism in AIS etiology and development.

CONCLUSION:

VDR BsmI was significantly associated with AIS susceptibility in the overall and Asian populations, while the VDR ApaI polymorphism only played a key role in AIS etiology and development in Asian populations.

#### AIS 2X more likely in Asians if poor Vitamin D Receptor - May 2018

 **Association between polymorphisms in vitamin D receptor gene and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a meta-analysis** 

European Spine Journal, Online: 04 May 2018  https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-018-5614-0

Purpose:This meta-analysis was performed to clarify whether the two single nucleotide polymorphisms (ApaI and BsmI) in vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene conferred susceptibility to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

Methods: A comprehensive literature search in five online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang) was performed to identify studies that analyzed the association between VDR gene polymorphisms and risk of AIS. Observational studies met the predetermined inclusion criteria were selected for meta-analysis. The most appropriate genetic model was identified using a genetic model-free approach. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software.

Results

Five eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis, which involved a total of 717 cases and 554 controls. A statistically significant association was observed between BsmI polymorphism and AIS (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.32, 2.62).

In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the association between BsmI polymorphism and AIS was significant in  **Asians (OR 2.06** , 95% CI 1.56, 2.73) but not in Caucasians (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.23, 2.19). However, the ApaI polymorphism was not associated with AIS. Moreover, no evidence of association between BMD and the two VDR gene polymorphisms was detected.

Conclusions: Meta-analysis of existing data suggested that BsmI was associated with increased risk of AIS in Asian populations. Nevertheless, further studies with rigorous design and more ethnic groups are encouraged to validate our findings.

#### Dark skinned AIS girls were 3.6 X more likely to have low vitamin D - May 2019

 **Impact of Race Subgroups on the Assessment of Vitamin D Status in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.** 

Orthopedics. 2019 May 1;42(3):158-162. [doi: 10.3928/01477447-20190424-07.](https://doi.org/10.3928/01477447-20190424-07.)

The authors' main objective was to demonstrate the confounding effect of combining subgroup data, specifically race, on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). This was a retrospective chart review. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) less than 20 ng/mL. Data were compared between white patients and black and Hispanic patients. Vitamin D status in girls with AIS was also compared with that in girls without AIS who had a history of fracture and with the medical literature to determine if deficiency in AIS was equal to or greater than other cohorts. Mean age was 13.9±2.3 years for the white girls with AIS (n=221) and 13.6±2.2 years for pooled non-whites (n=134). Significant racial differences were found that biased interpretation of the total pooled cohort. Mean 25(OH)D was 27.9±8.5 ng/mL for white girls with AIS vs 21.9±10.3 ng/mL for non-whites (P<.0001). Deficiency was present in  **13.1% of white girls vs 47.8% of non-white girls**  (P<.0001). Compared with girls with fractures and with the published literature, the race-matched deficiency rates were not abnormally high in girls with AIS. Prevalence of deficiency was greater in non-whites with AIS than in whites. However, percent deficiency was not greater in girls with AIS than in race-matched cohorts without AIS. Without separating data by race, interpretation of vitamin D status can be confounded.
