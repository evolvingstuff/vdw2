Background: The occurrence of allergic conditions, for example allergic asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, is rising worldwide. These allergic conditions are associated with poor life quality. Vitamin D is proposed to be linked with increased risk and severe forms of allergic diseases.

Aims: This review article aimed to evaluate the vitamin D level role and polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) in atopy.

Methods & materials: We analyzed publications that were focusing on levels of vitamin D and/or polymorphism analysis of vitamin D receptor gene in allergic asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis patients.

Results: We noticed that levels of vitamin D are extensively studied in atopy by many research groups, however, polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene and their link with levels of vitamin D lack comprehensive data. There is evidence that vitamin D may be associated with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic diseases. Some of VDR polymorphisms also may play a role in pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the data from different studies are controversial.

Discussion: The results of different studies are usually inconsistent, most probably due to populational bias or differences in methodology. Even though, more evidence shows a positive impact of vitamin D on the risk and outcomes of allergic diseases, especially atopic dermatitis, and asthma.

Conclusions: There is controversial data about the level of vitamin D and its role in atopy; however, more evidence shows a positive impact on the risk and outcomes of allergic diseases.
