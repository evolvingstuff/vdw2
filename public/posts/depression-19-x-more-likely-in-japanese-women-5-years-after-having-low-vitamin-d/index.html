<p>Background</p>
<p>Association between vitamin D levels and the occurrence of depression are not always consistent. The present cohort study aimed to determine this association in older adults, using a method for measuring vitamin D levels which is more accurate than those used in previous studies.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Participants were 3447 individuals aged 40–74 years without depressive symptoms at baseline who participated in the 5-year follow-up survey. The baseline investigation, including a self-administered questionnaire survey and blood collection, was conducted in 2011–2013. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were measured, and divided into overall quartiles summed up by sub-quartiles and stratified by age, sex, and season. The outcome was depressive symptoms determined by the CES-D (11-item, cut-off score of 6/7) 5 years later. Covariates were demographics, lifestyles, baseline CES-D score, and disease history.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Mean plasma 25(OH)D levels were 58.0 nmol/L in men and 45.7 in women (P &lt; 0.0001), and cumulative incidences of depressive symptoms were 249/1577 (15.8 %) in men and 313/1870 (16.7 %) in women (P = 0.4526). The lower 25(OH)D quartile group had higher adjusted ORs in men and women combined (P for trend = 0.0107) and women (P for trend = 0.0003), but not in men. Adjusted ORs of the lowest quartile group were significantly higher than the highest group in men and women combined (OR = 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.06–1.81) and women ( <strong>OR = 1.89</strong> , 95 % CI: 1.31–2.72).</p>
<p>Limitation</p>
<p>Depressive symptoms were self-reported.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Low vitamin D levels were associated with a high risk of depressive symptoms, especially in women. Women are thus considered a major target for preventing vitamin D deficiency to address depression.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Depression is a common mental disorder that affects 322 million people worldwide, corresponding to roughly 4.4 % of the global population in 2015 (World Health Organization, 2017). The total estimated number of people living with depression increased by 18 % between 2005 and 2015 (GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2016). Depression is widely known as a major risk factor for suicide (Moitra et al., 2021). Furthermore, late-life depression is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality among community-dwelling older people (Wei et al., 2019). For these reasons, prevention of depression is a high-priority public health issue.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin synthesized in the skin by sunlight and/or supplied from vitamin D-containing food. Levels of vitamin D are inversely associated with the risk of non-communicable chronic diseases, such as cancer (Han et al., 2019), cardiovascular diseases (Zhang et al., 2017), and diabetes (Lucato et al., 2017). Moreover, vitamin D is reportedly associated with mental health, consistent with the expression of vitamin D receptors and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes in the central nervous system (Humble, 2010). Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D is associated with the occurrence of depression. For instance, Li et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis of six cohort studies and concluded that vitamin D levels are inversely and dose-dependently associated with depression in older adults. However, relatively few published cohort studies have examined the association between vitamin D and depression, and results of the six cohort studies were not necessarily consistent with each other (Li et al., 2019). Results from two other recently published cohort studies on this theme were also conflicting (Briggs et al., 2019; Sahasrabudhe et al., 2020). Moreover, sex-dependent differences in the association between vitamin D levels and depression have been reported (Milaneschi et al., 2010; Rhee et al., 2020), but were not in mutual agreement.</p>
<p>One reason for the variability observed in the association between vitamin D levels and risk of depression is that vitamin D levels, evaluated by measuring blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D), are influenced significantly by demographic and environmental factors, such as age, sex, and season (Nakamura et al., 2015). To investigate the longitudinal association between blood 25(OH)D levels and diseases in community-dwelling individuals, we established a cohort study (Nakamura et al., 2018) which classified 8497 blood samples into quartile groups of 25(OH)D levels, stratified by age, sex, and season. This allowed us to determine accurately the vitamin D status by adjusting for its major correlates. The present study aimed to determine the longitudinal association between vitamin D levels and depressive symptoms over a 5-year follow-up period in middle-aged and older Japanese adults.</p>

Background

Association between vitamin D levels and the occurrence of depression are not always consistent. The present cohort study aimed to determine this association in older adults, using a method for measuring vitamin D levels which is more accurate than those used in previous studies.

Methods

Participants were 3447 individuals aged 40–74 years without depressive symptoms at baseline who participated in the 5-year follow-up survey. The baseline investigation, including a self-administered questionnaire survey and blood collection, was conducted in 2011–2013. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span&gt;[OH]&lt;/span&gt;D) levels were measured, and divided into overall quartiles summed up by sub-quartiles and stratified by age, sex, and season. The outcome was depressive symptoms determined by the CES-D (11-item, cut-off score of 6/7) 5 years later. Covariates were demographics, lifestyles, baseline CES-D score, and disease history.

Results

Mean plasma 25(OH)D levels were 58.0 nmol/L in men and 45.7 in women (P &lt; 0.0001), and cumulative incidences of depressive symptoms were 249/1577 (15.8 %) in men and 313/1870 (16.7 %) in women (P = 0.4526). The lower 25(OH)D quartile group had higher adjusted ORs in men and women combined (P for trend = 0.0107) and women (P for trend = 0.0003), but not in men. Adjusted ORs of the lowest quartile group were significantly higher than the highest group in men and women combined (OR = 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.06–1.81) and women ( **OR = 1.89** , 95 % CI: 1.31–2.72).

Limitation

Depressive symptoms were self-reported.

Conclusions

Low vitamin D levels were associated with a high risk of depressive symptoms, especially in women. Women are thus considered a major target for preventing vitamin D deficiency to address depression.

Introduction

Depression is a common mental disorder that affects 322 million people worldwide, corresponding to roughly 4.4 % of the global population in 2015 (World Health Organization, 2017). The total estimated number of people living with depression increased by 18 % between 2005 and 2015 (GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2016). Depression is widely known as a major risk factor for suicide (Moitra et al., 2021). Furthermore, late-life depression is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality among community-dwelling older people (Wei et al., 2019). For these reasons, prevention of depression is a high-priority public health issue.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin synthesized in the skin by sunlight and/or supplied from vitamin D-containing food. Levels of vitamin D are inversely associated with the risk of non-communicable chronic diseases, such as cancer (Han et al., 2019), cardiovascular diseases (Zhang et al., 2017), and diabetes (Lucato et al., 2017). Moreover, vitamin D is reportedly associated with mental health, consistent with the expression of vitamin D receptors and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes in the central nervous system (Humble, 2010). Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D is associated with the occurrence of depression. For instance, Li et al.

However, relatively few published cohort studies have examined the association between vitamin D and depression, and results of the six cohort studies were not necessarily consistent with each other (Li et al., 2019). Results from two other recently published cohort studies on this theme were also conflicting (Briggs et al., 2019; Sahasrabudhe et al., 2020).

Background
Association between vitamin D levels and the occurrence of depression are not always consistent. The present cohort study aimed to determine this association in older adults, using a method for measuring vitamin D levels which is more accurate than those used in previous studies.

Methods
Participants were 3447 individuals aged 40–74 years without depressive symptoms at baseline who participated in the 5-year follow-up survey. The baseline investigation, including a self-administered questionnaire survey and blood collection, was conducted in 2011–2013. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured, and divided into overall quartiles summed up by sub-quartiles and stratified by age, sex, and season. The outcome was depressive symptoms determined by the CES-D (11-item, cut-off score of 6/7) 5 years later. Covariates were demographics, lifestyles, baseline CES-D score, and disease history.

Results
Mean plasma 25(OH)D levels were 58.0 nmol/L in men and 45.7 in women (P &lt; 0.0001), and cumulative incidences of depressive symptoms were 249/1577 (15.8 %) in men and 313/1870 (16.7 %) in women (P = 0.4526). The lower 25(OH)D quartile group had higher adjusted ORs in men and women combined (P for trend = 0.0107) and women (P for trend = 0.0003), but not in men. Adjusted ORs of the lowest quartile group were significantly higher than the highest group in men and women combined (OR = 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.06–1.81) and women (__OR = 1.89__, 95 % CI: 1.31–2.72).

Limitation
Depressive symptoms were self-reported.

Conclusions
Low vitamin D levels were associated with a high risk of depressive symptoms, especially in women. Women are thus considered a major target for preventing vitamin D deficiency to address depression.

Introduction
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects 322 million people worldwide, corresponding to roughly 4.4 % of the global population in 2015 (World Health Organization, 2017). The total estimated number of people living with depression increased by 18 % between 2005 and 2015 (GBD 2015 DALYs and HALE Collaborators, 2016). Depression is widely known as a major risk factor for suicide (Moitra et al., 2021). Furthermore, late-life depression is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality among community-dwelling older people (Wei et al., 2019). For these reasons, prevention of depression is a high-priority public health issue.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin synthesized in the skin by sunlight and/or supplied from vitamin D-containing food. Levels of vitamin D are inversely associated with the risk of non-communicable chronic diseases, such as cancer (Han et al., 2019), cardiovascular diseases (Zhang et al., 2017), and diabetes (Lucato et al., 2017). Moreover, vitamin D is reportedly associated with mental health, consistent with the expression of vitamin D receptors and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes in the central nervous system (Humble, 2010). Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D is associated with the occurrence of depression. For instance, Li et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis of six cohort studies and concluded that vitamin D levels are inversely and dose-dependently associated with depression in older adults. However, relatively few published cohort studies have examined the association between vitamin D and depression, and results of the six cohort studies were not necessarily consistent with each other (Li et al., 2019). Results from two other recently published cohort studies on this theme were also conflicting (Briggs et al., 2019; Sahasrabudhe et al., 2020). Moreover, sex-dependent differences in the association between vitamin D levels and depression have been reported (Milaneschi et al., 2010; Rhee et al., 2020), but were not in mutual agreement.

One reason for the variability observed in the association between vitamin D levels and risk of depression is that vitamin D levels, evaluated by measuring blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), are influenced significantly by demographic and environmental factors, such as age, sex, and season (Nakamura et al., 2015). To investigate the longitudinal association between blood 25(OH)D levels and diseases in community-dwelling individuals, we established a cohort study (Nakamura et al., 2018) which classified 8497 blood samples into quartile groups of 25(OH)D levels, stratified by age, sex, and season. This allowed us to determine accurately the vitamin D status by adjusting for its major correlates. The present study aimed to determine the longitudinal association between vitamin D levels and depressive symptoms over a 5-year follow-up period in middle-aged and older Japanese adults.
