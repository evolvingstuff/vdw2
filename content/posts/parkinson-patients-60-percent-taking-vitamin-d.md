**Note by the founder of VitaminDWiki** 

A friend of mine got Parkinson's Disease

He started taking my recommendation of 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily

&nbsp; &nbsp;  4,000 IU seemed like a big dose back in 2012

&nbsp; &nbsp; His symptoms almost went away

&nbsp; &nbsp; He got back to working in his machine shop. playing his guitar, and singing

Unfortunately, his doctor thought it was too much

My friend reduced his dose to 2,000 IU daily - Dr. orders

&nbsp; &nbsp; His symptoms came back and have gotten much worse.

&nbsp; &nbsp;No longer any guitar, no singing, no driving, very weak voice,
