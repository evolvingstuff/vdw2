## Vitamin D

In 1923, Harry Steenbock and James Cockwell discovered exposure to ultraviolet light increased the Vitamin D concentration in food. After discovering that irradiated rat food cured the rats of rickets, Steenbock sought a patent. Steenbock then assigned the patent to the newly established Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. WARF then licensed the technology to Quaker Oats for use in their breakfast cereals. In addition, WARF licensed the technology for use as a pharmaceutical, Viosterol. WARF's commercialization of Vitamin D culminated in its enrichment of milk.

Through innovations from Hector DeLuca, Vitamin D continues to be a large percentage of WARF's income, around 70%.

Vitamin D Research at UW–Madison 

WARF founder Harry Steenbock WARF and UW-Madison have a long history of outstanding work with vitamin D. The licensing and commercial development of a vitamin D discovery made by UW-Madison biochemist Harry Steenbock is WARF's first success story. Steenbock founded WARF as a result of his 1923 breakthrough discovery that irradiating foods with ultraviolet light increased their vitamin D content. His discovery virtually eliminated rickets, a crippling bone disease of children caused by vitamin D deficiency.
