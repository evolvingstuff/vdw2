We tested whether maternal vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is related to the autism phenotype. Serum 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations of 929 women were measured at  **18 weeks' pregnancy** . The mothers of the three children with a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder had 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations above the population mean. 

The offspring of 406 women completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient in  **early adulthood** . Maternal 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations were unrelated to offspring scores on the majority of scales. 

However, offspring of mothers with low 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations (<49 nmol/L) were at increased risk for 'high' scores (?2SD above mean) on the Attention Switching subscale (odds ratio:  **5.46** , 95 % confidence interval: 1.29, 23.05). The involvement of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy in autism requires continued investigation.
