Early and prompt interventions are crucial in management of AP. Vitamin D, being a prominent actor in calcium metabolism, also takes part in immunity and thus in immune-system related disorders, ranging from infections to cancer. In this study, the role of vitamin D status of a patient on the severity of AP was investigated.</p><p>This study was conducted between June 2021 to August 2022 with a total of 315 patients. Blood samples were obtained upon admission. A 25-(OH)D3 level less than 10 ng/ml was defined as vitamin D deficiency. 10â€“19 ng/ml was defined as vitamin D insufficiency whereas 20 ng/ml or above was considered to be sufficient. Scoring systems (Ranson score, CTSI, BISAP, Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC) were applied.</p><p>Serum 25-(OH)D3 levels of patients with AP were found to be negatively correlated with severity of the disease according to RAC (p &lt; 0.001). In concordance to this finding, both Ranson score and BISAP were found to be statistically significantly related to 25-(OH)D3 levels. Both scoring systems revealed higher scores in patients with insufficient or deficient levels of 25-(OH)D3. Serum 25-(OH)D3 levels were not found to be related to intensive care unit admission or mortality.</p><p>This study revealed that serum 25-(OH)D3 level is related to the severity of AP. In the future, interventional studies with vitamin D therapy in otherwise serum 25-(OH)D3 deficient AP patients might reveal a new potential therapeutic agent in this mechanically complex, burdensome disorder.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a serious and complex disorder with varying disease course and severity. It is a major cause of hospital admissions and the incidence of the disease, which is 34 per 100,000 people in the general population, is rising <sup>[1,2]</sup>. AP is both a local and systemic disease and organ failure is seen in 20 % of patients. Organ failure is the hallmark of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and the major determining factor of prognosis <sup>[3]</sup>.</p><p>Leading causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol. Gallstones obstructing the pancreatic and/or biliary ducts lead to an increase in ductal pressure which ends up in uncontrolled activation of digestive enzymes. On the other hand, ethanol has direct effects on aciner cells <sup>[4]</sup>. Regardless of the various etiological factors underlying AP, end picture is both local and systemic inflammation with a wide spectrum of severity <sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Since AP is a disease with organ failure potential and mortality risk, scoring systems were developed in order to recognize patients who are at risk for severe disease. Early and prompt interventions are crucial in management of AP and commonly used scoring systems such as BISAP, Ranson&rsquo;s, CTSI, APACHE-II and Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC) help the clinician define the under-the-risk population with a probable severe disease course <sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Vitamin D is an essential molecule in human physiology. The hormonal and active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, is synthesized after a series of reactions in different organs and acts on nuclear receptors to exert its functions. Vitamin D is a prominent actor in calcium homeostasis and is responsible for maintaining a constant level of plasma calcium concentration through mobilization and increased absorbtion of calcium <sup>[7]</sup>. Vitamin D also takes part in immunity and thus in immune-system related disorders, ranging from infections to cancer. Vitamin D deficiency and in turn supplementation of a deficient state of it is being thought and studied as an independent determinant of mortality in various clinical pictures <sup>[8]</sup>, <sup>[9]</sup>, <sup>[10]</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the role of vitamin D status of a patient on the severity and disease course of AP was investigated. Given the strong link of vitamin D and inflammation, vitamin D was hypothesized to be a causative and/or a prognostic factor in AP, a disease in which inflammation is the main factor in disease course and patient outcome.</p><p><strong>Section snippets</strong></p><p>Patients</p><p>This prospective study was conducted in Antalya Training and Research Hospital between June 2021 to August 2022 in patients with AP. Patients above the age of 18 who presented to the emergency department or outpatient clinic and were hospitalized with AP diagnosis were involved in the study.

<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/cp-table-4.jpg alt=image width=900><p>Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disease of the pancreas. The incidence of CP is increasing worldwide but the effective therapies are lacking. Hence, it is necessary to identify economical and effective agents for the treatment of CP patients. Vitamin D (VD) and its analogues have been confirmed as pleiotropic regulators of cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and autophagy. Clinical studies show that VD deficiency is prevalent in CP patients. However, the correlation between VD level and the risk of CP remains controversial. VD and its analogues have been demonstrated to inhibit pancreatic fibrosis by suppressing the activation of pancreatic stellate cells and the production of extracellular matrix. Limited clinical trials have shown that the supplement of VD can improve VD deficiency in patients with CP, suggesting a potential therapeutic value of VD in CP. However, the mechanisms by which VD and its analogues inhibit pancreatic fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. We are reviewing the current literature concerning the risk factors for developing CP, prevalence of VD deficiency in CP, mechanisms of VD action in PSC-mediated fibrogenesis during the development of CP and potential therapeutic applications of VD and its analogues in the treatment of CP.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-a-potential-star-for-treating-chronic-pa-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-and-pancreatitis-a-narrative-review-of-current-evidence---may-2022>Vitamin D and Pancreatitis: A Narrative Review of Current Evidence - May 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(10), 2113; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14102113>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14102113</a></p><p>by Fei Cai 1,â€ ORCID,Cheng Hu 1,â€ ORCID,Chan-Juan Chen 1,Yuan-Ping Han 2,Zi-Qi Lin 1,Li-Hui Deng 1,* andQing Xia 1</p><p>1 Department and Laboratory of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Sichuan Provincial Pancreatitis Centre and West China-Liverpool Biomedical Research Centre, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China</p><p>2 The Center for Growth, Metabolism and Aging, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610017, China</p><p>Emerging research indicates that vitamin D metabolic disorder plays a major role in both acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). This has been demonstrated by studies showing that vitamin D deficiency is associated with pancreatitis and its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by binding with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). However, the role of vitamin D assessment and its management in pancreatitis remains poorly understood. In this narrative review, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in vitamin D/VDR signaling in pancreatic cells; the evidence from observational studies and clinical trials that demonstrate the connection among vitamin D, pancreatitis and pancreatitis-related complications; and the route of administration of vitamin D supplementation in clinical practice. Although further research is still required to establish the protective role of vitamin D and its application in disease, evaluation of vitamin D levels and its supplementation should be important strategies for pancreatitis management according to currently available evidence.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/pancreatitis-narrative.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=osteoporosis-is-19x-more-likely-if-have-acute-pancreatitis---2020>Osteoporosis is 1.9X more likely if have Acute Pancreatitis - 2020</h4><p><strong>The Risk of Vitamin D Deficiency, Osteoporosis, and Fractures in Acute Pancreatitis</strong></p><p>Pancreas: 5/6 2020 - p 629-633 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/MPA.0000000000001538>doi: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000001538</a> PDF behind paywall</p><p>Abou Saleh, Mohannad MDâˆ—; Alkhayyat, Motasem MDâ€ ; Mansoor, Emad MDâ€¡; Khoudari, George MDâ€ ; Simons-Linares, C.

Although vitamin D deficiency is widespread among the general population, vitamins A, E, and K deficiencies may more uniquely present in patients with CP. Yet, it is unclear whether fat-soluble vitamin status should be routinely monitored in all patients with CP or limited to those with EPI. The purpose of this review is to describe the laboratory status of vitamins A, E, and K in adult patients with CP and their association with exocrine pancreatic function. Five primary, observational studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Biochemical deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins were observed across trials but results varied with respect to whether EPI increased risk. Challenges related to the diagnosis and treatment of EPI along with potential confounders may contribute to the heterogeneity among study results. Although more studies are needed to determine the influence of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy on fat-soluble vitamin status as well as effective vitamin repletion strategies, clinicians should consider periodically screening for deficiencies in all patients with CP regardless of EPI to avoid associated health effects of vitamin depletion.</p><hr><h4 id=fat-soluble-vitamin-deficiencies-and-disruption-of-the-immune-system-in-pancreatic-cancer--a-vicious-cycle---sept-2022>Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies and Disruption of the Immune System in Pancreatic Cancer- A Vicious Cycle - Sept 2022</h4><p>Pancreas 51(8):p 923-929, September 2022. | DOI: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000002128</p><p>Aziz, Mohammad Hosein MDâˆ—; van der Meulen, Jan MD, PhDâ€ ; Mustafa, Dana A.M.

Despite advances in cancer treatment, PDAC survival rates have remained roughly unchanged over the years. Specifically, late diagnosis and insensitivity to currently available therapeutic regimens have been identified as the main causes for its poor survival. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) is a typical complication associated with PDAC diagnosis and pancreatic surgery. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, a major contributor to maldigestion in PDAC, is often not treated because it remains undetected because of lack of overt signs and symptoms. In this review, we will focus on the major consequences of PEI, including the inadequacy of lipase excretion, which results in deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Because PDAC is known for its immune-high jacking mechanisms, we describe key features in which deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins may contribute to the aggressive biological behavior and immune evasion in PDAC. Because PEI has been shown to worsen survival rates in patients with PDAC, detecting PEI and the related fat-soluble vitamin deficits at the time of PDAC diagnosis is critical. Moreover, timely supplementation of pancreatic enzymes and fat-soluble vitamins may improve outcomes for PDAC patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document/pancreatic-cancer---a-vicious-cycle.docx>Download the DOCX file from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=pancreatitis-associated-with-poor-vitamin-d-binding-protein-and-receptor-in-dogs-july-2023>Pancreatitis associated with poor Vitamin D Binding Protein and Receptor (in dogs) July 2023</h4><p>DOI: 10.1111/jvim.16809 FREE PDF</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-and-pancreatitis-a-narrative-review-of-current-evidence---may-2022-1>Vitamin D and Pancreatitis: A Narrative Review of Current Evidence - May 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(10), 2113; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14102113>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14102113</a></p><p>by Fei Cai 1,â€ ORCID,Cheng Hu 1,â€ ORCID,Chan-Juan Chen 1,Yuan-Ping Han 2,Zi-Qi Lin 1,Li-Hui Deng 1,* and Qing Xia 1</p><p>Emerging research indicates that vitamin D metabolic disorder plays a major role in both acute pancreatitis (AP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). This has been demonstrated by studies showing that vitamin D deficiency is associated with pancreatitis and its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by binding with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). However, the role of vitamin D assessment and its management in pancreatitis remains poorly understood. In this narrative review, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in vitamin D/VDR signaling in pancreatic cells; the evidence from observational studies and clinical trials that demonstrate the connection among vitamin D, pancreatitis and pancreatitis-related complications; and the route of administration of vitamin D supplementation in clinical practice. Although further research is still required to establish the protective role of vitamin D and its application in disease, <strong>evaluation of vitamin D levels and its supplementation should be important strategies for pancreatitis management according to currently available evidence.</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/pancreatitis-narrative-review-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
