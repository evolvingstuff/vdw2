Introduction:

Recent  evidence  suggests  that  long-chain  omega-3  polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC n-3) supplementation may enhance training adaptations associated with athletic performance. This study examined the impact of LC n-3 supplementation on body composition, strength, and power in collegiate athletes.

Methods: Athletes (n = 27)were assigned to one of two conditions for eight weeks: fish oil (FO, 3.0 gâˆ™d-1<span>[1.75g EPA and 1.1g DHA]</span>, n = 15) or placebo (PL, high-oleic safflower oil, 3g, n = 12)for 8-weeks. Athletes completed a three-day food log and questionnaire,  provided  a  blood  sample  via  fingerstick  to  determine  their  LC  n-3 status,    conducted    body    composition    analysis    through    dual    energy    x-ray absorptiometry, and had their handgrip strength (HGS) and countermovement jump assessed. 

Results: In  the FO  group,  the  omega-3  index,  EPA  and  DHA  increased  by  73%, 332% and 64%, respectively, while there was no change in the placebo group. HGS significantly improved in the FO group (p= .018, +9.1%) and did not change in the placebo group (p= .615, -1.8%). Body composition and power were similar between groups. The change in HGS was positively correlated with the relative change in EPA and EPA:AA ratio.

Conclusions: For  in-season  athletes,  the  addition  of  LC  n-3  supplementation  to  a dietary regime increases blood LC n-3 status and may preserve or improve muscular performance while in-season
