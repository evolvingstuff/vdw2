#### [Fructose alters hundreds of brain genes, which can lead to a wide range of diseases](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160422091900.htm)

Science Daily April 2016 reporting on a study which is on this page

 **Scientists report that diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reverse the damage** 

 **Snips** 

* “A range of diseases -- from diabetes to cardiovascular disease, and from Alzheimer's disease to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- are linked to changes to genes in the brain. A new study by UCLA life scientists has found that hundreds of those genes can be damaged by fructose, a sugar that's common in the Western diet, in a way that could lead to those diseases”

 **Rats trained to escape from maze, then drank 1 of 3 liquids for 6 weeks** 

1. Water

1. Water + fructose (equiv to 1 liter of soda/day)

1. Water+ fructose + Omega-3

* The animals that had been given only the fructose  **navigated the maze about half as fast than the rats that drank only water**  -- indicating that the fructose diet had impaired their memory. The rats that had been given fructose and DHA, however, showed very similar results to those that only drank water -- which strongly suggests that the DHA eliminated fructose's harmful effects.
