## Osteoporosis Prevention—A Worthy and Achievable Strategy

- - - - 

^The workshop title in March 2010 was <span style="color:#F00;">Osteoporosis Prevention ...Vitamin D...</span> .

The conclusions published in Oct 2010 only talk about the need to DETECT Osteoporosis with a $250 test for Bone Mineral Density

rather than PREVENTING Osteoporosis with $10 of vitamin D. 

For more on BMD see: [Bone density measurements were never meant to be treatment guidelines](http://www.betterbones.com/blog/post/bone-density-and-bone-drugs.aspx?) 

by Dr. Susan Brown at BetterBones.com, where she had 34 items on vitamin D and bones such as [Calcium, Vitamins K2, D3](http://www.betterbones.com/bonenutrition/vitamin-k.aspx)

We cannot expect a profession to eliminate their jobs.  

Or, as one person said in an email to me:  **No silo of bureaucrats will enable or expedite their own unemployment.** 

The more time it takes to learn a job, the more resistance the job holder will have to the elimination of the job.

This has been true for train caboose engineers, aircraft navigators, telephone operators, buggy whip manufacturers, ulcer doctors who tried to minimize stomach acid, etc. etc.

We should expect strong resistance for decades by doctors to the use of vitamin D to PREVENT osteoporosis, cancers, MS, ..., much less treat it.

The more time it takes to learn a profession, the more resistance there will be to the reduction or elimination of the profession^

This  special  issue  of  Nutrients  records  seven  of  the  presentations  made  to  the  very  successful meeting titled  **<span style="color:#F00;">“Osteoporosis Prevention: A Workshop on Calcium, Vitamin D and other Nutritional Aspects”</span>**   held  in  Adelaide,  Australia  on  5  and  6  March  2010  <span>[1-7]</span>.  Seventy  six  delegates  attended from  across  Australia  and  New  Zealand  to  review  the  current  evidence  that   **dietary  calcium  intake, vitamin D status** , other nutrients and exercise play a significant role in bone mineral homeostasis and act to prevent the development of osteoporosis. The Workshop promoted the concept that osteoporosis is a predictable and preventable disease and that significant benefit would be achieved to reduce the incidence  of  osteoporosis  and  the  risk  of  fractures  from  nutrition  and  life  style  activities.  Such  an achievement will not only save considerable pain, suffering and morbidity but will also have a major financial benefit for the healthcare system for which the cost of treatment for osteoporotic fractures already amounts to billions of dollars.

A  concrete  proposal  arising  from  the  Workshop  was  the  adoption  by  way  of  signing  a  petition addressed to the Federal Australian Government stating the following:

We   recommend   to   the   Screening   Subcommittee   of   the   Australian   Population   Health Development Principal Committee (APHDPC) of the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council that   **all  women  should  be  screened  for  bone  density  at  the  menopause**   with  the  aim  of  reducing post-menopausal  bone  loss  and  age-related  fractures  by  adopting  lifestyle  measures,  particularly diet and exercise.

The  session  of  the  Workshop  devoted  to  discussion  of  this  statement  agreed  that  the  strongest evidence   that   lifestyle   measures   could   improve   bone   status   and   prevent   fractures   was   in postmenopausal women, since this is the time at which bone loss starts. 

It was agreed that women with below average Bone Mineral Density at the hip or spine, as indicated by a T-score below zero, were the most likely to benefit from lifestyle advice to preserve bone and reduce the risk of fractures. Issues identified  for  further  investigation  included  whether  it  could  be  beneficial  to  measure  bone  density again at 5 and/or 10 years later. The actual interventions to be recommended and the optimal practices to ensure the highest adoption rate of such lifestyle measures would need further research and review.

Professor B E Christopher Nordin was a driving force for instigating and organizing the Workshop. Speakers  acknowledged  his  major  contribution  to  osteoporosis  research  over  some  60  years.  In particular  he  was  recognized  for  his  inspirational  leadership  for  research  and  advocacy  of  the importance  of  calcium  deficiency  in  the  etiology  of  postmenopausal  osteoporosis.  His  prodigious productivity as a medical researcher includes his outstanding publishing output of over 500 scientific papers  and  his  achievement  of  an  h-index  of  67  (Web  of  Science)  with  8  of  these  publications accumulating over 200 citations. This volume is dedicated to Professor Chris Nordin in recognition of his immense contribution to osteoporosis research and its prevention.
