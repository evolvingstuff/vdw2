### Summary of article and observations after searching the web in Jan 2012

* Magnesium L-Threonate has been found to deliver Magnesium to the brains of rats. 

* This appears to reverse brain problems like Alzheimer’s – at least in rats. 

* No studies so far on humans.  

* No indication that Magnesium L-Threonate is better absorbed outside of the brain – in rats or humans.  

* Many supplement companies are selling the patented compound

> Example: [Swansons](http://www.swansonvitamins.com/SWU700/ItemDetail%20)

* Seems like the rats were given a LOT of the stuff. [Calculation](http://osdir.com/ml/health-discussion-help/2011-01/msg02577.html) by a person on the internet found that the equivalent for humans would be 7 grams per day. 

> Unsure of that persons assumptions (Rat = 6, human = 37?)
