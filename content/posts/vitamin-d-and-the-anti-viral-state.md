Vitamin D has long been recognized as essential to the skeletal system. Newer evidence suggests that it also plays a major role regulating the immune system, perhaps including immune responses to viral infection. Interventional and observational epidemiological studies provide evidence that vitamin D deficiency may confer increased risk of influenza and respiratory tract infection. Vitamin D deficiency is also prevalent among patients with HIV infection. Cell culture experiments support the thesis that vitamin D has direct anti-viral effects particularly against enveloped viruses. Though vitamin D's anti-viral mechanism has not been fully established, it may be linked to vitamin D's ability to up-regulate the anti-microbial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin 2. Additional studies are necessary to fully elucidate the efficacy and mechanism of vitamin D as an anti-viral agent.

Although few studies have examined the effects of vitamin D on Hepatitis B infection, a study of 2015 Gambian tuberculosis patients identified a silent T to C base change polymorphism in codon 352 of the VDR that was correlated with significantly lowered rates of persistent Hepatitis B infection and tuberculosis, but not malaria.96 This polymorphism affects vitamin D levels, VDR mRNA stability, and VDR mRNA levels.97-100 The antiHepatitis B response in these patients may be cathelicidin mediated, much like the cathelicidin-mediated anti-tuberculosis response recently described.25

In a Vietnamese dengue study, the same polymorphism was associated with resistance to severe  **dengue** .101 At least one study has demonstrated administration of oral vitamin D3 reduces the severity and length of dengue fever, but the small sample size (n = 5) makes it difficult to draw any robust conclusions.102

A study conducted by Bitetto et al. showed that in immune competent patients 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/l) are significantly associated with poorer response to the standard antiviral hepatitis C therapy of ribavirin and pegylated interferon.103 An earlier study by Petta et al. revealed an association between lower vitamin D levels and failure to clear virus during treatment in chronic hepatitis C patients.104 The same study showed that low vitamin D levels were also associated with liver fibrosis. Therefore, this makes it difficult to determine whether lower vitamin D levels correlate with lower viral clearance or are just a consequence of damaged livers.
