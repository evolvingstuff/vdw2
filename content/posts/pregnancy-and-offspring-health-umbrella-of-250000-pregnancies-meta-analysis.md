Background

Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with several adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

Objective

To summarize systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the effects of vitamin D deficiency and of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy on maternal and offspring health-related outcomes.

Methods

Prior to conducting this umbrella review, we registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42022368003). We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on vitamin D in pregnancy, from database inception to October 2, 2023. All outcomes related to vitamin D in pregnancy obtained from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were extracted. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently chose studies and collected information on health outcomes. The quality of the included articles’ methodology was assessed using AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews–2).

Results

We identified 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which included 250,569 women. Our results demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, small-for gestational age/low birth weight infants, recurrent miscarriage, bacterial vaginosis and gestational diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy increases birth weight, and reduces the risk of maternal pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, and vitamin D deficiency, fetal or neonatal mortality, as well as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder in childhood. In women with gestational diabetes mellitus, vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy can reduce the risk of maternal hyperbilirubinemia, polyhydramnios, macrosomia, fetal distress, and neonatal hospitalization.

Conclusion

Due to the association with adverse maternal and offspring health outcomes, we recommend the vitamin D status in pregnancy should be monitored, particularly in women at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. It is suggested that pregnant women take a dose of >400 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to prevent certain adverse outcomes.

Background
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked with several adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

Objective
To summarize systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the effects of vitamin D deficiency and of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy on maternal and offspring health-related outcomes.

Methods
Prior to conducting this umbrella review, we registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42022368003). We conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on vitamin D in pregnancy, from database inception to October 2, 2023. All outcomes related to vitamin D in pregnancy obtained from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were extracted. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently chose studies and collected information on health outcomes. The quality of the included articles’ methodology was assessed using AMSTAR 2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews–2).

Results
We identified 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which included 250,569 women. Our results demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, small-for gestational age/low birth weight infants, recurrent miscarriage, bacterial vaginosis and gestational diabetes mellitus. Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy increases birth weight, and reduces the risk of maternal pre-eclampsia, miscarriage, and vitamin D deficiency, fetal or neonatal mortality, as well as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder in childhood. In women with gestational diabetes mellitus, vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy can reduce the risk of maternal hyperbilirubinemia, polyhydramnios, macrosomia, fetal distress, and neonatal hospitalization.

Conclusion
Due to the association with adverse maternal and offspring health outcomes, we recommend the vitamin D status in pregnancy should be monitored, particularly in women at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. It is suggested that pregnant women take a dose of &gt;400 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy to prevent certain adverse outcomes.
