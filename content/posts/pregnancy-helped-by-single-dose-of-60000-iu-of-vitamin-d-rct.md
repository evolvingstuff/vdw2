CONTEXT: Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent throughout the world. Pregnant women, neonates and infants form most vulnerable groups for vitamin D deficiency.

OBJECTIVE: (1) To find prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women. (2) To evaluate the effect of supplementation with cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D levels in pregnant women and evaluate its correlation with feto-maternal outcome.

DESIGN: Randomized control trial from years 2010 to 2012.

SETTING: Tertiary care centre, Delhi, India.

PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred and eighty pregnant women. Study population divided randomly into two groups: group A: nonintervention (60 women) and group B: intervention (120 women).

INTERVENTION: The intervention group received supplementation of vitamin D in dosages depending upon 25(OH)-D levels.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of maternal complications such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes associated with vitamin D deficiency and risk of low birthweight and poor Apgar score in infants of mothers with vitamin D deficiency.

RESULTS: Adjusted serum 25(OH)-D concentration was lower in group A as compared to group B (mean 46·11 ± 74·21 nmol/l vs 80 ± 51·53 nmol/l). Forty-four percent patients in group A and 20·3% patients in group B developed preterm labour/pre-eclampsia/gestational diabetes. Newborns of mothers in group A had lower cord blood levels of 25(OH)-D levels as compared to group B (mean 43·11 ± 81·32 nmol/l vs 56·8 ± 47·52 nmol/l). They also had lower birthweight of mean 2·4 ± 0·38 kg as compared to group B 2·6 ± 0·33 kg.

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of maternal comorbidities and helps improve neonatal outcomes.

[RCT: Are vitamin D levels associated with pregnancy outcomes?](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/rct-are-vitamin-d-levels-associated-with-pregnancy-outcomes/) Report on study at Vitamin D Council

Given large doses of vitamin D ( not daily) depending on deficiency level

&nbsp; &nbsp;Sufficient  (> 20 ng) 60,000 IU vitamin D at 20 weeks - not much left after 19 weeks!!

&nbsp; &nbsp;Insufficient:  120,000 IU at 20 and 24 weeks 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Deficient:120,000 IU of vitamin D at 20, 24, 28, and 32 weeks.(about only half had > 20 ng at birth)
