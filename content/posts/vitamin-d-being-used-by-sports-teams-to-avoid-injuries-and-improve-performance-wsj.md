#### Comment by Dr. Matthews on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lrmatthews1/posts/10217237593844357) 3.5 years later (June 2019)

With millions of dollars at stake, Wall Street Journal ( WSJ) was one of the first to catch on to my pioneering work of " **vitamin D3 improves athletic performance, reduces athletic injuries, concussions/ CTE, and saves sports teams millions of dollars.** " As a trauma surgeon at the busiest Level I trauma center in the U.S. ( Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia), I have seen 30 years of the worst of the worst trauma patients. The Wall Street Journal gets it! Using vitamin D3 saves millions of dollars, keeps sports teams healthy, reduce injuries and concussions, improves athletic performance, and increase chances of winning more games and championships. Not taking vitamin D3 is putting your players and team's health at risk. The NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, and other professional, college, and sports at all levels will have to sit down and talk to me at some point. I am approximately 10 years ahead of everybody on this subject matter. I pioneered it.
