**Note: This survey found that children in Poland often only get Vitamin D supplments in the winter**

Objective

The study aimed to assess the association between parental-reported vitamin D supplementation and caries in a national sample of 3-year-olds in Poland.

Materials and methods

A total of 1900 children, representing all provinces of Poland, were invited. The questionnaires concerned vitamin D supplementation, socio-demographics, and oral health behaviours. Based on dental examination, caries scores (dmft/dmfs), prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) and severe ECC (S-ECC) were calculated. The Spearman’s correlation, linear regression and logistic regression were used to assess the association between various factors and caries (p < 0.05).

Results

A total of 1638 children were tested. Of this number, 99.1% infants were supplemented with vitamin D. Supplementation had been continued seasonally in 55.2% children. ECC/S-ECC prevalence were significantly lower in children receiving vitamin D (ECC 38.3% vs. 44.7%, OR = 0.77; S-ECC 20.5% vs. 27.1%, OR = 0.69; p < 0.05). Mean dmft/dmfs were lower in those with supplementation (1.54 ± 2.72 vs. 2.24 ± 3.55; 2.40 ± 5.56 vs. 3.72 ± 7.56, respectively; p < 0.001). After controlling for confounding factors, supplementation was not significantly associated with caries; only dt/ds were still associated. Maternal education, sweetened beverages before bedtime, bottle use were significantly associated with S-ECC.

Conclusions

Lower caries prevalence was observed in those with vitamin D supplementation. The association between parental-reported vitamin D and ECC/S-ECC was not significant in Polish children. Decayed teeth and supplementation were still associated. Dietary habits can modify the association with caries.

Clinical relevance

There may be an association between vitamin D supplementation and lower caries in children. Parents should supplement their children during periods of significant growth and development.
