#### [Wikipedia â€“ Cortisol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol%20)

* It is released in response to stress

* It is synthesized from cholesterol

* It suppresses the immune system by "muting" the white blood cells

* It also decreases bone formation

#### [The role of vitamin D deficiency in thyroid disorders](http://thehealthyskeptic.org/the-role-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-thyroid-disorders) Healthy Skeptic Aug 2010

When the body is in an active stress response, most of the cholesterol is used to make cortisol and not enough is left over for vitamin D production.

#### Hypothesis: High stress results in

* Increased Cortisol

   * Reduced immune system and

   * Reduced Cholesterol

      * Reduced Vitamin D production from skin and bio-availability from gut (see reference below)

         * Reduced Immune System (for a second reason)
