!!!Vitamin D Nutritional Status and Antenatal Depressive Symptoms in African American Women
Journal of Women&amp;#39;s Health. Online Ahead of Print: July 23, 2012

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with depression; however, no studies have examined the relationship of vitamin D and antenatal depression. Antenatal depression increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes and poorer postpartum maternal and infant health. African American women are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and antenatal depression. Thus, we examined if early pregnancy vitamin D nutrition (VDN) was associated with antenatal depressive symptoms among African American women in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Methods: Women (n=178) were recruited from obstetrics clinics of a large health system. VDN was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). 
Depression symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale; 
CES-D?16 equates with criteria for __clinical depression__. 
Logistic regression was used to examine the association of log-transformed 25-OHD and elevated depression symptoms (CES-D?16).

Results: Mean 25-OHD was 13.4±8.4?ng/mL; most women (82.6%, n=147) were vitamin D inadequate or deficient (25-OHD&amp;lt;20?ng/mL). 
Mean CES-D was 15.2±10.7, and 74 (41.6%) women had a CES-D?16, suggestive of clinical depression.
A significant inverse relationship was found between log (25-OHD) and CES-D?16 (odds ratio __[OR] 0.54__, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.99, p=0.046). 

__For every 1-unit increase in log (25-OHD) (corresponding to 2.72?ng/mL increase in 25-OHD), the odds of CES-D?16 decreased by 46%.__

Conclusions: African American women with lower VDN exhibit increased depressive symptoms. 
Research on vitamin D supplementation for reducing antenatal depressive symptoms is needed.

!!Summary by VitaminDWiki
#Fact: Depresion is associated with low levels of vitamin D
#Fact: Dark skin women have lower vitamin D than those with white skins
#Fact: Pregnancy decreases vitamin D
*1+2+3 = The direction of the results of this study
*Note: Without supplementation vitamin D levels drop in early pregnancy and remain low for up to a year after birth,

!!!!Season of Birth and Exceptional Longevity: Comparative Study of American Centenarians, Their Siblings, and Spouses

This study explores the effects of month of birth (a proxy for early-life environmental influences) on the chances of survival to age 100. Months of birth for 1,574 validated centenarians born in the United States in 1880–1895 were compared to the same information obtained for centenarians&amp;#39; 10,885 shorter-lived siblings and 1,083 spouses. Comparison was conducted using a within-family analysis by the method of conditional logistic regression, which allows researchers to control for unobserved shared childhood or adulthood environment and common genetic background. It was found that months of birth have significant long-lasting effect on survival to age 100: siblings born in September–November have higher odds to become centenarians compared to siblings born in March. A similar month-of-birth pattern was found for centenarian spouses. These results support the idea of early-life programming of human aging and longevity.

Many studies have [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1336|proven that taking more vitamin D] decreases incidence of many diseases and even [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1886|treats a few of them].
