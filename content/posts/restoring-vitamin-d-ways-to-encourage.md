* [Esther Dyson: We Need to Fix Health Behavior](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/518901/esther-dyson-we-need-to-fix-health-behavior/) Fast Company, Sept 2013

* In March, Dyson(a health investment angel) released a [manifesto](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/how-communities-can-hold-down-health-care-costs-by-esther-dyson) describing new idea:

> create a challenge among small U.S. cities to see which can most improve its health, measured by factors like weight, blood pressure, and sick days.

> First paragraph in manifesto: It is hard to find anyone in health care who does not believe that spending $100 now on healthy behavior – exercise and proper nutrition, counseling for pre-diabetics, risk monitoring, and so on – could yield more than $200 in reduced costs and improved outcomes later.
