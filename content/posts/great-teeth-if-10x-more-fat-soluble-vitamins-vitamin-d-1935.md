> 1)  **gum disease** , 2) tooth decay, 3) periodontitis and 4) weak teeth. 

> “The most obvious sign of vitamin D deficiency on the mouth is **gum disease** , and in more extreme cases tooth decay.

> “A very high proportion of cases of gum disease that we see are caused by a vitamin D deficiency.

> “It is rare that a vitamin D deficiency would affect the appearance of the teeth - only if it is both severe and occurs when teeth are developing i.e. you only see it in patients who have rickets (bone disease caused by a vitamin D deficiency).”

 **60 years<span style="color:#00F;">bleeding gums</span> disappeared after oral application of Vitamin D - by the founder of VitaminDWiki** 

* I had bleeding gums all of my life. 

* Bleeding gums continued after raising my vitamin D blood level was raised to 100 ng/ml

   * Note - Like ~20% of the population, I have a poor vitamin D receptor

   * so not all of the Vitamin D in my blood actually gets to my tissues

* Topical Vitamin D had eliminated the psoriasis on my right knee (bike injury)

* Decided to try topical vitamin D on my gums

* Made up a black tooth powder from charcoal, Bentonite Clay, and Vitamin D

   * Charcoal = teeth whitener

   * [Bentonite Clay](https://wellnessmama.com/5915/bentonite-clay-benefits/) =  bacteria killer & abrasive & remineralizer of teeth

   * ~100,000 IU Vitamin D per tablespoon of powder - from Bio-Tech capsules

* Brushed my teeth daily with the black powder

* Used regular toothpaste before or after the black powder - several times a week

   * Once a week used interdental brush dipped in the black powder between my teeth

   * Note: I use the small size - not much space between my teeth

* After a few months no more bleeding gums!!
