OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the vitamin D status in patients with occlusive or aneurysmatic arterial disease in relation to clinical cardiovascular risk profiles and markers of atherosclerotic disease.

METHODS: We included 490 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD, n = 254) or aortic aneurysm (n = 236). Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), ankle-brachial index (ABI), serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and vitamin D were assessed. Patients were categorised into severely (?25 nmol l(-1)) or moderately (26-50 nmol l(-1)) vitamin D deficient, vitamin D insufficient (51-75 nmol l(-1)) or vitamin D sufficient (>75 nmol l(-1)).

RESULTS: Overall, 45% of patients suffered from moderate or severe vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was similar in patients with PAD and those with an aortic aneurysm. Low levels of vitamin D were associated with congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. 

Adjusting for clinical cardiovascular risk factors, multivariable regression analyses showed that low vitamin D status was associated with 

* higher CIMT (P = 0.001),  <span style="color:#00F;">(carotid intima-media thickness)</span>

* lower ABI (P < 0.001)  <span style="color:#00F;">(ankle-brachial index)</span> and 

* higher hs-CRP (P = 0.022). <span style="color:#00F;">(high-sensitive C-reactive protein)</span>

CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows a strong association between low vitamin D status and arterial disease, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and irrespective of the type of vascular disease, that is, occlusive or aneurysmatic disease.
