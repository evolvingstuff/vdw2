#### How Long Can the Coronavirus Keep Reinfecting Us? - July 2022

 **[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/07/coronavirus-will-never-run-out-ways-reinfect-us/670976/?utm_source=feed)** 

* "This will keep happening. “There’s not a lot of things I’m confident about in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, but I think I’m extremely confident we’ll keep seeing new variants that are progressively eroding antibody neutralization,” says Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center."

* "Instead of always trying to catch up to the virus though, could we broaden our immunity and get ahead of it? "

   *  **Founder of VitaminDWiki says YES!  strengthen the INNATE immume system with Vitamin D**

#### You Are Going to Get COVID Again … and Again …<span style="color:#F00;">and Again</span>- May 2022

 **[The Atlantic - May 27,2022](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/covid-reinfection-research-immunity/639436/?utm_source=feed) &nbsp; &nbsp;  <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/you-are-going-to-get-covid-again-and-again-and-again---the-atlantic-compresspdf.pdf">PDF</a>** 

* "Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, told me that her best guess for the future has the virus infiltrating each of us, on average,  **every three years or so** ."

* "If Gordon is right about this thrice(ish)-per-decade pace, that would be on par with what we experience with flu viruses, which scientists estimate hit us about every two to five years, less often in adulthood. It also matches up well with the documented cadence of the four other coronaviruses that seasonally trouble humans, and cause common colds. "

* However "This virus seems capable of tangling into  **just about every tissue in the body** , affecting organs such as the heart, brain, liver, kidneys, and gut; it has already claimed the lives of millions, while saddling countless others with symptoms that can linger for months or years. Experts think the typical SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to get less dangerous, as population immunity builds and broadens"

* " **Long COVID** , too, might remain a possibility with every discrete bout of illness."
