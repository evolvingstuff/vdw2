**1) After mass vaccination, most countries eliminate mask and social distancing  
2) Vaccination has not been documented to decrease asymptomatic infection for COVID-Delta  
3) Vaccines are less effective against stopping COVID-Delta infections  
4) Patients with COVID-Delta may have 1,000 times more viral particles than those with COVID-19 &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/1000-x-more-viral-particles-in-delta-variant---july-2021.pdf">July 7 preprint</a>** 

 **Summary: Populations not required to wear masks after vaccination become COVID-Delta vectors to both unvaccinated and vaccinated, This was not nearly as much of a problem before the Delta variant that has perhaps 1000X higher viral load**

* "On 4 July, Dr Anthony Fauci had told NBC that "it's feasible that a  **fully vaccinated person can be an asymptomatic carrier of COVID** , and potentially transmit the virus, including the more contagious delta variant"."

* "...WHO chief scientist, said, “There are reports coming in that  **vaccinated populations have cases of infection, particularly with the Delta variant** . The majority of these are mild or asymptomatic infections.”

* The WHO chief scientist said that the organisation is urging people to  **continue wearing masks**  and practice social distancing because it "certainly reduces your chances of severe hospitalisation and death significantly”.

* "Yan Li, Jun Yuan, Jianfeng He, Jing Lu and their colleagues then assessed the level of viral loads during the first positive PCR test. They reveal that viral loads were  **1,260 times higher**  than those recorded during infections with historical strains 19A and 19B on the day SARS-CoV-2 was first detected"

* "These results resulted in the fact that more than  **80%**  of oropharyngeal samples taken from patients with a Delta variant infection contained more than 6 x 105 viral RNA copies / mL. Only  **19%**  of samples from people infected with historical strains 19A or 19B contained such a high viral load."

   * This seems to indicate that the viral load happened about 4X as often
