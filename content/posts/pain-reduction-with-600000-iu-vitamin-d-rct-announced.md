### Comment by VitaminDWiki

 **This is essentially a 600,000 IU loading dose, which, based on previous studies, should work well.** 

 **The loading dose amount and time period is very similar to what VitaminDWiki is proposing in the video being created** 

 **No update on trial as of Jan 2024 since 2013 - suspect it was cancelled**
