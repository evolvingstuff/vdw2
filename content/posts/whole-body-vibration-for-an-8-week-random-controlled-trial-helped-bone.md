Purpose. To examine the effects of two doses of low-frequency (12?Hz), low-magnitude (0.3?g), whole body vibration on markers of bone formation and resorption in postmenopausal women. Methods. Women were recruited and randomized into a sham vibration control group, one time per week vibration group (1×/week), or three times per week vibration group (3×/week). Vibration exposure consisted of 20 minutes of intermittent vibration for the 1×/week and 3×/week groups, and sham vibration (<0.1?g) for the control group for eight weeks. Double-blinded primary outcome measures were urine markers of bone resorption: N-telopeptide X normalised to creatinine (NTx/Cr) and bone formation: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP). 

Results. Forty-six women (59.8 ± 6.2 years, median 7.3 years since menopause) were enrolled. NTx/Cr was significantly reduced (34.6%) in the 3×/wk vibration group but not in the 1×/wk vibration group compared with sham control ( x x x x) group. No effect of time or group allocation was observed on the bone formation marker ALP ( x x x x)

Conclusion. We have shown for the first time that low-frequency, low-magnitude vibration 3×/week for eight weeks in postmenopausal women results in a significant reduction in NTx/Cr, a marker of bone resorption, when compared with sham vibration exposure.

# [Whole Body Vibration](http://www.henrylahore.com/Health/WBV/index.html) is another excellent way to prevent falls.

## Random Controlled Trials found that with just 5 minutes a day the amount of elderly falls was reduced by 2X.

## Such a low amplitude of vibration was used that the participants could not notice if the platform was vibrating or not.

The wife of the administrator of this web site takes 10,000 IU of vitamin D AND uses the Whole Body Vibration Platform while doing dishes several times per week.

Parts cost of the platform is less than $200
