Hypovitaminosis C and D are highly prevalent in acute-care hospitals, but their clinical implications have not been investigated. Because deficiencies of these vitamins can adversely affect mood, we conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of vitamin C (500 mg twice daily) or D (5000 IU daily) supplementation on psychological status, as assessed using two different validated instruments. 

At baseline, 73% of patients had a subnormal plasma vitamin C concentration (< 28.4 μM) and 79% had a subnormal plasma 25OHD concentration (< 75 nM). 

Vitamin C provision for a mean of 8.2 days (n = 26) normalized plasma vitamin C concentrations (P < 0.0001) and resulted in a 71% reduction in Profile of Mood States ® total mood disturbance score (from 24.0 ± 18.2 to 6.9 ± 14.4, mean ± SD; P = 0.0002) and a 51% reduction in psychological distress as measured using the Distress Thermometer (from 4.5 ± 2.9 to 2.2 ± 2.2; P = 0.0002). 

By contrast, high-dose vitamin D provision for a mean of 8.1 days (n = 26) increased plasma 25OHD concentrations (P < 0.0001), but not into the normal range, and had statistically insignificant effects on mood (21.7 ± 17.3 to 14.6 ± 17.7; P = 0.067) and distress (3.7 ± 2.6 to 3.4 ± 2.8; P = 0.45).

Conclusion: Hypovitaminosis C and D are highly prevalent in acutely hospitalized patients. Vitamin C supplementation improves mood and reduces distress in these patients. Supported by the Lotte and John Hecht Foundation and a Faculty of Medicine student research bursary.
