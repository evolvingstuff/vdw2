* Arterial stiffness measure (PWM) reduced from 12.2 to 12.0 by a single injection of 100,000 IU Vitamin D

* Even though only 6% of the people got above 30 ng level of vitamin D

* VitaminDWiki expects that far less hypertension if more vitamin D was used and a higher % of people had gotten to > 30 ng

* Injection does not appear to be necessary

Aims

Vitamin D deficiency may lead to impaired vascular function and abnormalities in central arterial stiffness. We compared the effects of two different doses of vitamin D3 on arterial stiffness in an elderly population with deficient serum 25OHD levels.

Methods

119 known vitamin D deficient(<50nmol/L) subjects were randomised to receive either 50,000IU or 100,000IU single IM vitamin D3.

Results

In the group that received 100,000IU vitamin D, median PWV 

* decreased from 12.2(5.1-40.3) m/sec 

* to 11.59(4.3-14.9) m/sec after 8 weeks (p=0.22). 

A mean decrease of 3.803+/-1.7(p=0.032) in Augmentation Index (Aix)( a measure of systemic stiffness) was noted. 

 **Only 3/51(5.8%) who received 100,000IU vitamin D reached levels of  sufficiency (>75nmol/L).** 

Conclusions

A significant decrease in Augmentation index was seen in the group that received 100,000IU vitamin D. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were still deficient at 8 weeks in the majority of patients which may be attributable to impaired bioavailability.
