&lt;p>The relationship between sunlight and allergies in children has received limited attention from researchers. We sought to explore how early exposure to solar radiation is associated with allergic morbidity within the PARIS birth cohort study. Our research dealt with children who attended at least one of two health checkups: at 18 months (n = 2012) and at 8-9 years (n = 1080).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>More muscle strength 80 years after being born in warm season (no surprise)</title><link>/posts/more-muscle-strength-80-years-after-being-born-in-warm-season-no-surprise.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/more-muscle-strength-80-years-after-being-born-in-warm-season-no-surprise.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Background. Vitamin D is involved in muscle health and function. This relationship may start from the earliest stages of life during pregnancy when fetal vitamin D relies on maternal vitamin D stores and sun exposure. Our objective was to determine whether there was an effect of the month of birth (MoB) on muscle mass and strength in older adults.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Season of birth associated with many health problem (UK Biobank)</title><link>/posts/season-of-birth-associated-with-many-health-problem-uk-biobank.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/season-of-birth-associated-with-many-health-problem-uk-biobank.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Early-life conditions play an important role in human development, affecting health status and survival. Conditions in utero partly depend on the external environment and thus vary in relation to the season of birth. The aim of this study was to investigate if people born in different seasons of the year differ in values of biomarkers that reflect conditions during fetal development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preterm birth varies with season: 25 percent more likely if conception in autumn</title><link>/posts/preterm-birth-varies-with-season-25-percent-more-likely-if-conception-in-autumn.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/preterm-birth-varies-with-season-25-percent-more-likely-if-conception-in-autumn.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Season of birth, a marker of in utero vitamin D exposure, has been associated with a wide range of health outcomes. Using a dataset of ∼450,000 participants from the UK Biobank study, we aimed to assess the impact of this seasonality on birth weight, age at menarche, adult height and body mass index (BMI). Birth weight, age at menarche and height, but not BMI, were highly significantly associated with season of birth. Individuals born in summer (June–July–August) had higher mean birth weight (P = 8 × 10−10), later pubertal development (P = 1.1 × 10−45) and taller adult height (P = 6.5 × 10−9) compared to those born in all other seasons. Concordantly, those born in winter (December–January–February) showed directionally opposite differences in these outcomes. A secondary comparison of the extreme differences between months revealed higher odds ratios &lt;span>[95% confidence intervals (CI)]&lt;/span> for low birth weight in February vs. September (1.23 &lt;span>[1.15–1.32]&lt;/span>, P = 4.4 × 10−10), for early puberty in September vs. July (1.22 &lt;span>[1.16–1.28]&lt;/span>, P = 7.3 × 10−15) and for short stature in December vs. June (1.09 &lt;span>[1.03–1.17]&lt;/span>, P = 0.006). The above associations were also seen with total hours of sunshine during the second trimester, but not during the first three months after birth. Additional associations were observed with educational attainment; individuals born in autumn vs. summer were more likely to continue in education post age 16 years (P = 1.1 × 10−91) or attain a degree-level qualification (P = 4 × 10−7). However, unlike other outcomes, an abrupt difference was seen between those born in August vs. September, which flank the start of the school year. Our findings provide support for the ‘fetal programming’ hypothesis, refining and extending the impact that season of birth has on childhood growth and development. Whilst other mechanisms may contribute to these associations, these findings are consistent with a possible role of in utero vitamin D exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Health problems are related to birth month</title><link>/posts/health-problems-are-related-to-birth-month.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/health-problems-are-related-to-birth-month.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Anorexia nervosa and Vitamin D - several studies</title><link>/posts/anorexia-nervosa-and-vitamin-d-several-studies.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/anorexia-nervosa-and-vitamin-d-several-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Anorexia Nervosa appears to be associated with&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Association studies form the backbone of biomedical research, with almost every effort in the field ultimately boiling down to a comparison between groups, coupled with some form of statistical test intended to determine whether or not any observed difference is more or less than would be expected by chance. Unfortunately, although the paradigm is powerful and frequently effective, it is often forgotten that false positive association can easily arise if there is any bias or systematic difference in the way in which study subjects are selected into the considered groups. To protect against such confounding, researchers generally try to match cases and controls for extraneous variables thought to correlate with the exposures of interest. However, if seemingly homogenously distributed exposures are actually more heterogeneous than appreciated, then matching may be inadequate and false positive results can still arise. In this review, we will illustrate these fundamental issues by considering the previously proposed relationship between month of birth and multiple sclerosis. This much discussed but false positive association serves as a reminder of just how heterogeneous even easily measured environmental risk factors can be, and how easily case&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Season of birth associated with Pneumonia (10 %) and Multiple Sclerosis (30 %)</title><link>/posts/season-of-birth-associated-with-pneumonia-10-percent-and-multiple-sclerosis-30-percent.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/season-of-birth-associated-with-pneumonia-10-percent-and-multiple-sclerosis-30-percent.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Suicide is a complex behaviour contributing to a significant number of unnecessary deaths worldwide. Accordingly, the quest for suicide risk factors is one of the most intensively developing issues of psychiatric research. In the last few decades a number of interesting results have been published about associations between season of birth (SOB) and several physiological and pathological aspects of human life, while, in regard to neuroscience, several investigations confirmed that SOB is associated with the risk of several major neuropsychiatric disorders and suicide as well. Research concerning the possible causative factors behind these associations were also performed suggesting that&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7 percent less likely to get immune mediated disease if born in the fall</title><link>/posts/7-percent-less-likely-to-get-immune-mediated-disease-if-born-in-the-fall.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/7-percent-less-likely-to-get-immune-mediated-disease-if-born-in-the-fall.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) varies with latitude. Ebers has co-ordinated a study &lt;sup>[46]&lt;/sup> that examined more than 40,000 Canadian, British, Danish and Swedish patients with multiple sclerosis. The results show that in the Northern hemisphere, significantly fewer (8.5%) people with MS were born in November and significantly more (9.1%) were born in May. In the Southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed and November is the peak month and May the lowest. There are several clues as to the cause. An important study &lt;sup>[47]&lt;/sup> compared the risk of two or more siblings having multiple sclerosis to the risk of its occurrence in both twins in a non-identical pair. There should be no difference, but non-identical twins do have a significantly higher risk of both having MS than non-twin siblings. This suggests that the pre-natal and post-natal environment affects the overall risk. Pinpointing the actual environmental factor has been problematic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is the variation in winter babies due to vitamin D – 2009</title><link>/posts/is-the-variation-in-winter-babies-due-to-vitamin-d-2009.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/is-the-variation-in-winter-babies-due-to-vitamin-d-2009.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="new-light-on-the-plight-of-winter-babies--wsj-2009">New Light on the Plight of Winter Babies – WSJ 2009&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Children born in the winter months already have a few strikes against them. Study after study has shown that they test poorly, don&amp;rsquo;t get as far in school, earn less, are less healthy, and don&amp;rsquo;t live as long as children born at other times of year. Researchers have spent years documenting the effect and trying to understand it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypothesis: Low vitamin D linked to Myopia</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-low-vitamin-d-linked-to-myopia.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-low-vitamin-d-linked-to-myopia.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>The White House mentioned 2010 that myopia was rapidly increasing in recent decades along with obesity.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
