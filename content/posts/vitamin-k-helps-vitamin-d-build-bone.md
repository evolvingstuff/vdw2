Comment on the web

After a year of supplementation, subjects in the K1 and K2 groups showed significantly lower ratios of undercarboxylated (inactivated) osteocalcin to carboxylated osteocalcin than subjects in the other groups, suggesting better bone utilization of available calcium. 

Deoxypyridinoline, a common marker of bone breakdown, was significantly lower in the vitamin K groups compared to the placebo group and the calcium and vitamin D group.

Total-body bone mineral density was improved in all test groups compared to placebo, but lumbar spine bone mineral density improved only in the vitamin K groups.

Wish it said if there was any difference between K1 and K2
