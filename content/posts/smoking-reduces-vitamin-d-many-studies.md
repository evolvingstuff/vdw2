 **Two pathways are often proposed for how smoking decreases vitamin D:** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Smoking decreases Calcium. and Vitamin D is used up in replacing the Calcium

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Smoking injures the body, and vitamin D is used up in repairing the body

 **It appears that taking Vitamin D while smoking will:** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Decrease the incidence of the many health problems associated with smoking - even [lung cancer](/posts/lung-cancer-risk-decreases-5-percent-for-every-25-nanogram-increase-in-vitamin-d-meta-analysis)

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Decrease the desire to smoke (perhaps take fewer smoking breaks?)

&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Increase breathing capacity

 **Opinion: If you must smoke, have recently smoked, or are getting 2nd hand smoke:  
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  take Vitamin D and perhaps Omega-3   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They will extinguish much of the inflammation caused by inhaling tobacco smoke.** 

 **Vitamin D should also help people quit smoking**   

&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Reduces weight gain associated with quitting smoking

&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Reduces depression associated with quitting smoking

#### Black women smokers have the lowest vitamin D levels – Feb 2020

 **History of Tobacco, Vitamin D and Women** 

Int J Vitam Nutr Res, 1-6 2020 Feb 24, DOI: 10.1024/0300-9831/a000640

Kiano Reza Manavi 1, Brenda Pauline Alston-Mills 2, Marvin Paul Thompson 3

Tobacco usage kills more than 8 million people a year. Approximately 7 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use, while approximately 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. About 200 million of the world's one billion smokers are women and usage among women is increasing in some countries. Nicotine from smoking tobacco, specifically its metabolite cotinine, has negative effects on human health causing lung cancer, COPD and non-respiratory problems. Over a billion people worldwide are Vitamin D deficient or insufficient, which is prevalent across all age-groups, geographic regions, and sunlight. With the discovery of Vitamin D in 1919, a new chapter in the prevention of rickets was introduced opening the door to its therapeutic properties for other diseases. Since 1919, there have been many clinical and epidemiolocal studies performed globally on the effect of the vitamin on prevention of other diseases, including but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and osteoporosis. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has been associated with reduced levels of Vitamin D in the bloodstream and sinus tissues. Manavi et al. (2015) demonstrated that among three smoking categories (heavy, light, and non-smokers),

* black female heavy smokers have lower vitamin D (13.374 ng/ml), than 

* Hispanic (19.213 ng/ml) or 

* white (24.929 ng/ml) 

females are correlating to higher levels of cotinine. Therefore, blood serum concentrations of cotinine contribute to decreased Vitamin D concentrations in addition to other factors such as gender and ethnicity.

#### 40% less likely to have tobacco-related cancer if > 30 ng of vitamin D - Oct 2015

 **Prospective associations between vitamin D status, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.** 

Am J Clin Nutr. 2015 Oct 7. pii: ajcn110510

Deschasaux M1, Souberbielle JC2, Latino-Martel P3, Sutton A4, Charnaux N4, Druesne-Pecollo N3, Galan P3, Hercberg S5, Le Clerc S6, Kesse-Guyot E3, Ezzedine K7, Touvier M3.

BACKGROUND:

Experimental evidence has suggested that vitamin D may be protective against tobacco-related cancers through the inhibition of the formation of tumors induced by tobacco carcinogens. To our knowledge, only one previous epidemiologic study investigated the association between vitamin D status and tobacco-related cancer risk, and no study has focused on vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms.

OBJECTIVE:

Our objective was to prospectively study the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations, vitamin D-related gene polymorphisms, and risk of tobacco-related cancers.

DESIGN:

A total of 209 tobacco-related cancers were diagnosed within the SU.VI.MAX (Supplémentation en vitamines et minéraux antioxidants) cohort (1994-2007) and were matched with 418 controls as part of a nested case-control study. Tobacco-related cancers (i.e., cancers for which tobacco is one of the risk factors) included several sites in the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, and urinary systems. Total plasma 25(OH)D was assessed with the use of an electrochemoluminescent assay. Polymorphisms were determined with the use of a TaqMan assay. Conditional logistic regression models were computed.

RESULTS:

A 25(OH)D concentration ≥30 ng/mL was associated with  **reduced risk of tobacco-related cancers (OR for ≥30 vs. <30 ng/mL: 0.59;**  95% CI 0.35, 0.99; P = 0.046). This association was observed in former and current smokers (OR for ≥30 vs. <30 ng/mL: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.84; P = 0.01) but not in never-smokers (P = 0.8). The vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI AA genotype and retinoid X receptor (RXR) rs7861779 TT genotype were associated with increased risk of tobacco-related cancers <span>[OR for homozygous mutant type (MT) vs. wild type (WT): 1.87; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.23; P-trend = 0.02; OR for heterozygous type (HT) plus MT vs. WT: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.38; P = 0.02]</span>.

CONCLUSIONS:

In this prospective study, high vitamin D status [25(OH)D concentration ≥30 ng/mL](25(OH)D%20concentration%20≥30%20ng/mL) was associated with decreased risk of tobacco-related cancers, especially in smokers. These results, which are supported by mechanistic plausibility, suggest that vitamin D may contribute to the prevention of tobacco-induced cancers in smokers and deserve additional investigation. The SU.VI.MAX trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428.

#### Vitamin D deficiency, Smoking, and Lung Function in the Normative Aging Study; 2012

 **Measurements and Main Results** : In the overall cohort, there was no significant effect of vitamin D deficiency on lung function nor on lung function decline. 

In both cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariable models there was effect modification by  **vitamin D status on the association between smoking and lung function** . 

Cross-sectional analysis revealed lower lung function in current smokers with vitamin D deficiency (FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC, p? 0.0002) and longitudinal analysis showed more rapid rates of decline in FEV1 (p=0.023) per pack-year of smoking in subjects with vitamin D deficiency as compared to subjects who were vitamin D sufficient.

 **Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower lung function and more rapid lung function**  decline in smokers over 20 years in this longitudinal cohort of elderly men. This suggests that vitamin D sufficiency may have a protective effect against the damaging effects of smoking on lung function. Future studies should seek to confirm this finding in the context of smoking and other exposures that affect lung function.

#### Why is vitamin D beneficial when quitting smoking?

Vitamin D has a wide range of health benefits, including being associated with lower rates of cancer. 

This beneficial vitamin has also been proven to have mental health benefits, such as stress reduction. 

Anybody who has attempted to quit smoking is able to tell you the importance of reducing stress during the process.

#### DID YOU KNOW (Magnesium)?

 **Magnesium**  supplements are sometimes recommended for those trying to quit smoking. 

Taking magnesium helps ease anxiety and reduce intense nicotine cravings.

#### Active form of vitamin D actually counteracts the effects of cigarette smoke in th lab - March 2015

 **1α, 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 counteracts the effects of cigarette smoke in airway epithelial cells**

a Department of Respiratory, Chronic Airways Diseases Laboratory, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China

b School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China

Received 5 December 2014, Revised 18 February 2015, Accepted 13 March 2015, Available online 18 March 2015

Cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) alter calpain-1 expression via ERK signaling pathway in bronchial epithelial cells. 1α, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D3) inhibits cigarette smoke-induced epithelial barrier disruption.

This study was aimed to explore whether the 1,25D3 counteracted the CSE effects in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE). In particular, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and permeability, expression and distribution of E-cadherin and β-catenin, calpain-1 expression, and ERK phosphorylation were assessed in the CSE-stimulated 16HBE cells. The CSE induced the ERK phosphorylation, improved the calpain-1 expression, increased the distribution anomalies and the cleaving of E-cadherin and β-catenin, and resulted in the TER reduction and the permeability increase. The 1,25D3 reduced these pathological changes. The 1,25D3 mediated effects were associated with a reduced ERK phosphorylation.

In conclusion, the present study provides compelling evidence that the 1,25D3 may be considered a possible valid therapeutic option in controlling the cigarette smoke-induced epithelial barrier disruption.

#### Mice exposed to smoke for weeks, mice with low Vitamin D got many lung problems - Sept 2015

[Vitamin D deficiency exacerbates COPD-like characteristics in the lungs of cigarette smoke-exposed mice](http://www.respiratory-research.com/content/16/1/110)

| --- | --- | --- |
| Vitamin D deficient diet  | <100 IU/kg | 17–20 ng/ml. |
| Control diet  | 1000 IU/kg  | 75–90 ng/ml |

Mice exposed to the smoke were  **second-generation mice on the diet** 

 **From Background** 

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive expiratory airflow limitation and is associated with chronic inflammation in the airways and lung parenchyma . In the majority of cases, this inflammatory response in COPD is initiated by long-term exposure to cigarette smoke (CS), which triggers a series of events that damage the airways and terminal airspaces, leading to lung function decline and emphysema.

 **Note: My mother smoked most of her life and died of lung cancer.   
She had tried several times to quit the addiction.   
Every time she tried quitting she gained too much weight, so went back to smoking.

 **Note: Your Vitamin D levels must be > 30 ng to be of any benefit.  
 You cannot just stop smoking and start taking 4,000 IU of vitamin D and expect any help in stopping smoking.    
Must either start taking 4,000-5,000 IU two months BEFORE stopping smoking OR start with a [loading dose](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) when stopping** 

 **"It took more than 7,000 studies ... before the first Surgeon General report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s"  
Then it took the AMA another 10 years to agree with the Surgeon General**

#### Lower vitamin D levels in mother and neaonate if 2nd-hand smoke - Aug 2022

 **Comparison of Vitamin D Levels and Related Factors in Pregnant Women and Neonates Exposed to Second-Hand Smoke** 

Cureus . 2022 Aug 23;14(8):e28287. [doi: 10.7759/cureus.28287.](https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.28287.)

Introduction: Exposure to second-hand smoke, a significant public health issue today, may lead to various health problems, especially in pregnant women and their infants. Low vitamin D levels during pregnancy may lead to preeclampsia and gestational diabetes in the mother, while it may cause low birth weight and respiratory problems in the infant.

Method: The study group consisted of 42 mothers, who smoked regularly, and their infants and 45 mothers (passive smokers), who were regularly exposed to second-hand smoke in their home environment, although they did not smoke, and their infants. Meanwhile, the control group consisted of 46 healthy mothers, who did not smoke and were not exposed to second-hand smoke at home, and their infants with similar gestational age and birth weight. Blood samples were taken as two different samples, from the mother and the baby, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and related blood parameters were studied and compared statistically.

Results: 25(OH)D, calcium, and magnesium levels of mothers who smoked were significantly lower than those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who did not. Moreover, the vitamin D levels of mothers and babies exposed to second-hand smoke in the non-smoker group were significantly lower than mothers and babies who were not exposed to second-hand smoke. In the babies of these three groups, a significant decrease was observed only in vitamin D levels.

Conclusion: The present study shows that pregnant women and their infants exposed to second-hand smoke have lower vitamin D levels. Hence, more emphasis should be put on vitamin D monitoring and supplementation to prevent severe health problems in pregnant women and their infants exposed to tobacco smoke. Further studies are needed to assess the associated risks for maternal and fetal health as well as possible long-term implications for the infant.

#### Faster decline in lung function when smokers had low vitamin D – April 2021

 **Vitamin D deficiency and lung function decline in healthy individuals: A large longitudinal observation study** 

Respir Med. 2021 Apr 20;182:106395. [doi: 10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106395](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106395)

Aim: A reliable evidence from a comprehensive large-scale study supporting associations between serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) level (SVDL) and lung function decline (LFD) in healthy individuals has been unavailable. Using a well-established health screening database, we assessed the associations between SVDL and LFDs, measured as the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC ratio.

Methods: Serial SVDL and lung function data were analyzed using linear mixed models, which were performed in smokers and non-smokers separately. Vitamin D-deficient individuals (VDDs) were defined when their SVDLs were consistently lower than 20 ng/mL at all measurements.

Results: A total of 1371 individuals were analyzed. The mean FEV1 decline rates of VDDs and vitamin D-normal individuals (VDNs) in smokers were -33.35 mL/year (95% CI: 39.44 to -27.26 mL/year) and -15.61 mL/year (95% CI: 27.29 to -4.21 mL/year) respectively, over a mean of 6.29 years of observation with statistical significance (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant differences observed between decline rates of FEV1 in non-smokers. Similarly, FVC decline rates of VDDs were significantly greater than those of VDNs only in smokers (P < 0.001). However, FEV1/FVC ratio decline rates showed no significant difference between VDDs and VDNs regardless of their smoking status.

Conclusions: Consistently low SVDLs predicted more rapid FEV1 and FVC declines in smokers. However, FEV1/FVC decline rate was not associated with SVDL. SVDL may be used to identify healthy smoking individuals at high risk for accelerated LFD.
