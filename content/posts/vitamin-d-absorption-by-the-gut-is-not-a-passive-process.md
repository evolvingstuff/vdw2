#### INTESTINAL ABSORPTION OF VITAMIN D: FROM THE MEAL TO THE ENTEROCYTE

Food and Function,  Accepted Manuscript. DOI: 10.1039/C4FO00579A, First published online 13 Oct 2014

Vitamin D plays key roles in bone, infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases. As most people get inadequate sun exposure for sufficient vitamin D status, they need adequate intake of dietary vitamin D. Many studies see optimizing vitamin D status as a public health priority. It is thus vital to gain deeper insight into vitamin D intestinal absorption. It was long assumed that vitamin D intestinal absorption is a  **passive process** , but new data from our laboratory showed that it is actually far more complex than previously thought. 

This review describes the fate of vitamin D in the human upper gastrointestinal lumen during digestion and focus on the proteins involved in the intestinal membrane and cellular transport of vitamin D across the enterocyte. 

Although recent data significantly improve our understanding of vitamin D intestinal absorption, further studies are still needed to increase our knowledge the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
