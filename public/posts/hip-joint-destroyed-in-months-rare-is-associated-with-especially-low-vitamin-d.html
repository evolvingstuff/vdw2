Background:  **Rapidly destructive osteoarthritis (RDO) of the hip joint**  is characterised by the rapid destruction of the femoral head with or without acetabular involvement. There has been increasing interest in this disease over the past years; however, the entity is still poorly understood, and its pathophysiology remains unknown. Yet, there is ample evidence today that increased bone metabolism might play a role in the onset and progression of the disease. Vitamin D is of utmost importance to maintain a balanced bone metabolism. However, whether vitamin D deficiency is involved in disease development remains to be elucidated. Further, the vitamin D status of patients with RDO has not yet been analysed. For this reason, the objective of this study was to assess the vitamin D status of patients with RDO. Moreover, the aim was to clarify whether there is a difference in the vitamin D status of patients with RDO compared with patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA). 

Methods: In this single-centre analysis, the 25(OH)D, PTH, and calcium levels of 29 patients who presented with RDO between 2020 and 2022 were assessed. Results: Altogether, 97% of patients (28/29) were vitamin D deficient, a further 3% (1/29) were vitamin D insufficient, and not a single patient presented with a sufficient vitamin D status. Notably, the vitamin D levels of RDO patients (mean = 11.04 ng/mL) were significantly lower than the vitamin D levels of patients with OA (mean = 22.16 ng/mL, p = 0.001). 

Conclusion: In conclusion, we found a widespread and high rate of vitamin D deficiency in patients with RDO. Hence, we believe that 25(OH)D status should routinely be analysed in these patients.

 **Would be interesting to go back and see what the D levels were months before the RDO**

Background: __Rapidly destructive osteoarthritis (RDO) of the hip joint__ is characterised by the rapid destruction of the femoral head with or without acetabular involvement. There has been increasing interest in this disease over the past years; however, the entity is still poorly understood, and its pathophysiology remains unknown. Yet, there is ample evidence today that increased bone metabolism might play a role in the onset and progression of the disease. Vitamin D is of utmost importance to maintain a balanced bone metabolism. However, whether vitamin D deficiency is involved in disease development remains to be elucidated. Further, the vitamin D status of patients with RDO has not yet been analysed. For this reason, the objective of this study was to assess the vitamin D status of patients with RDO. Moreover, the aim was to clarify whether there is a difference in the vitamin D status of patients with RDO compared with patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA). 

Methods: In this single-centre analysis, the 25(OH)D, PTH, and calcium levels of 29 patients who presented with RDO between 2020 and 2022 were assessed. Results: Altogether, 97% of patients (28/29) were vitamin D deficient, a further 3% (1/29) were vitamin D insufficient, and not a single patient presented with a sufficient vitamin D status. Notably, the vitamin D levels of RDO patients (mean = 11.04 ng/mL) were significantly lower than the vitamin D levels of patients with OA (mean = 22.16 ng/mL, p = 0.001). 

Conclusion: In conclusion, we found a widespread and high rate of vitamin D deficiency in patients with RDO. Hence, we believe that 25(OH)D status should routinely be analysed in these patients.
