Topics that are discussed in-depth by leading researchers and clinicians range from the newest findings in endocrinology, <a href=http://epidemiology.researchtoday.net/>epidemiology</a>, histology, photobiology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular pathology to new concepts for prophylaxis and treatment. Experts in the field as well as health care professionals not intimately involved in these specialized areas are provided with the most significant and timely information related to these topics. It is the aim of this book to summarize essential up-to-date information for every clinician or scientist interested in how to balance between positive and negative effects of UV-exposure to minimize the risks of developing <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>vitamin D</a> deficiency and <a href=http://skincancer.researchtoday.net/>skin cancer</a>.</p><p><br><p><img src=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/images/vitamind-0309063507.jpg alt=Dietary width=105 height=160> <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0309063507/research-20><b>Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride</b></a> Since 1941, Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) has been recognized as the most authoritative source of information on nutrient levels for healthy people. Since publication of the 10th edition in 1989, there has been rising awareness of the impact of nutrition on chronic disease. In light of new research findings and a growing public focus on nutrition and health, the expert panel responsible for formulation RDAs reviewed and expanded its approach - the result: &ldquo;Dietary Reference Intakes&rdquo;. This new series of references greatly extends the scope and application of previous nutrient guidelines. For each nutrient the book presents what is known about how the nutrient functions in the human body, what the best method is to determine its requirements, which factors (<a href=http://caffeine.researchtoday.net/>caffeine</a> or exercise, for example) may affect how it works, and how the nutrient may be related to chronic disease. The first volume of &ldquo;Dietary Reference Intakes&rdquo; includes calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>vitamin D</a>, and <a href=http://fluoride.researchtoday.net/>fluoride</a>. The second book in the series presents information about thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, <a href=http://vitaminb12.researchtoday.net/>vitamin B12</a>, pantothenic acid, biotin, and choline. Based on analysis of nutrient metabolism in humans and data on intakes in the U.S. population, the committee recommends intakes for each age group - from the first days of life through childhood, sexual maturity, midlife, and the later years. Recommendations for pregnancy and lactation are also made, and the book identifies when intake of a nutrient may be too much. Representing a new paradigm for the nutrition community, &ldquo;Dietary Reference Intakes&rdquo; encompasses: Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) - these are used to set Recommended Dietary Allowances. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), and intakes that meet the RDA are likely to meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all individuals in a life-stage and gender group; Adequate Intakes (AIs) - these are used instead of RDAs when an EAR cannot be calculated, and both the RDA and the AI may be used as goals for individual intake; Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) - intakes below the UL are unlikely to pose risks of adverse health effects in healthy people. This new framework encompasses both essential nutrients and other food components thought to pay a role in health, such as dietary fiber. It incorporates functional endpoints and examines the relationship between dose and response in determining adequacy and the hazards of excess intake for each nutrient.</p></p><p> <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0751331961/research-20></a><img src=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/images/vitamind-B0015KGWVU.jpg alt=The width=118 height=160> <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0015KGWVU/research-20><b>The Latest Research on Vitamin D</b></a></p><p><span style=color:red><strong><span>[March 2008 Kindle $7 ]</span></strong></span></p><p>An interview with Dr. John Cannell, Executive Director of the <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> Council.</p><p>Dr. John Cannell is founder of the non-profit <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> Council and www.cholecalciferol-council.com, both established to alert the public and physicians to this terribly underappreciated issue.</p><p>Topics Covered:</p><ul><li><a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> is not a vitamin - find out what it really is.</li><li>Find out how to have your D levels tested - and what to do with the result.</li><li>Learn how you can produce adequate <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> in your body.</li><li>Should you sunbathe?</li><li>Get the best recommendation here.</li><li>Learn the difference between -plant- <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> and -human- <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a>.</li><li>Discover the link between <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> deficiency, <a href=http://depression.researchtoday.net/>depression</a>, <a href=http://autism.researchtoday.net/>autism</a>, and other neuro-developmental disorders.</li><li>Find out how <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> supports heart health.</li><li>Learn about the vital link between <a href=http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/>Vitamin D</a> and the absence of most cancers.</li><li>Have you been taking cod liver oil?

However, one cannot obtain these amounts from most dietary sources unless one is eating oily fish frequently.
