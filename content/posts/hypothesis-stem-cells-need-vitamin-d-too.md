The majority of patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are expected to have vitamin-D deficiency early post-HSCT due to poor nutritional status and limited sun exposure. 

The importance of vitamin D in the immune system has been well defined over the past several years, as vitamin-D has demonstrated modulatory effects on the immune system through B- and T-lymphocyte, macrophage, monocyte and dendritic cell regulations, which are the effector cells involved in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) pathophysiology after HSCT. 

High dose early replacement of vitamin D might attenuate autoimmune reactions and may decrease the severity of GVHD. In this article, we discuss the hypothetical link between early vitamin-D deficiency and GVHD and its potential therapeutic role in GVHD and long term bone loss after HSCT.
