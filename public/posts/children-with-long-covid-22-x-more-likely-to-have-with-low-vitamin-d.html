Given the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties of vitamin D, understanding its role in long COVID symptoms is of growing interest. This study aimed to determine vitamin D status in children with COVID-19 and assess its impact on the clinical course of disease and long COVID development.</p><p>Methods: A prospective cohort study included hospitalized children with confirmed COVID-19, aged 1 month to 18 years, diagnosed between September 2022 and March 2024. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were measured upon hospital admission, and follow-up was done to identify long COVID symptoms.</p><p>Results: In total, 162 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were examined. Vitamin D deficiency was determined in 8.0%, insufficiency in 25.3%, and optimal levels in 66.7% of children with COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was observed in 73% of children over 6 years and 21.6% of children under 6 years of age. Comorbid conditions were 1.4 times more frequent in children with vitamin D insufficiency, with undernutrition and obesity playing the most significant roles (p = 0.0023, p = 0.0245, respectively). Serum 25(OH)D concentration depends on COVID-19 severity (p = 0.0405) and children with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency had a longer hospital stay (4 vs. 3 days, p = 0.0197). The vitamin D status affected the median levels of neutrophils, lymphocytes, their ratio, prothrombin time, fibrinogen levels, and the frequency of increased immunoglobulins M and E levels. Among 134 children who agreed to follow up, 56 (41.8%) experienced long COVID symptoms, while 78 (58.2%) recovered fully. Long COVID was frequently observed in children with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency (p = 0.0331).</p><p>The odds of developing long COVID were <strong>2.2 times</strong> higher (p = 0.0346) in children with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency compared to those with optimal levels.</p><p>Children with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency</p><ul><li><p>more often exhibited neurological (80% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.0040) and</p></li><li><p>musculoskeletal symptoms (16% vs. 0%, p = 0.0208).</p></li></ul><p>Conclusion: The 25(OH)D concentrations in children with COVID-19 depended on their age. Comorbid conditions affect the vitamin D status in children with COVID-19. Vitamin D influenced the COVID-19 severity and duration of hospitalization. There was an increased risk of developing long COVID in children with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, and its impact on the development of neurological symptoms associated with long COVID was established.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/long-covid-in-children-and-low-vitamin-d-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382327"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382327",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382327"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382327"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382327"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382327"></script></body></html>
