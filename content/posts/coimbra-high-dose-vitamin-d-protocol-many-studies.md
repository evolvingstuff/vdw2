#### [Interview with Dr. Menendez - Coimbra Protocol and Vitamin D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxf0BlKdnYI&t=97s) 66 minutes  Sept 2024

* (01:13) Dr. Sergio Menendez is a specialist in autoimmune diseases who studied medicine in Havana, completed his PhD in neurological science in Brazil, and  **has treated over 4,500 patients with the Coimbra Protocol since 2012.** 

* (09:28) The Coimbra Protocol was created by neurologist Dr. Coimbra in 2002 and is based on high doses of vitamin D to control autoimmune diseases, with  **approximately 90% of patients experiencing disease remission.** 

* (10:15) Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, producing autoantibodies that cause inflammation and tissue damage in specific regions (examples: multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus).

* (18:23) Dr. Coimbra discovered that  **patients with autoimmune diseases have resistance**  to converting inactive vitamin D to active vitamin D, requiring much higher doses than typically prescribed to receive therapeutic benefits.

* (22:40) Vitamin D has three key functions in controlling autoimmune diseases: increasing defense against pathogens, improving immune tolerance, and blocking autoimmune inflammatory responses.

* (24:51) The main potential toxicity concern with high-dose vitamin D is excessive calcium absorption, which can damage kidneys. Patients must follow dietary restrictions (avoiding dairy products, certain seeds) and drink plenty of water to maintain calcium balance.

* (36:42) Symptoms of excessive calcium include persistent thirst, nausea, vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, and loss of appetite. If these occur, patients should stop the protocol and contact their doctor.

* (42:54) The protocol requires ongoing supervision by doctors specifically trained in the Coimbra Protocol through blood and urine tests. Patients can find qualified doctors worldwide (though they are limited in France).

* (45:02) Treatment duration varies, as autoimmune diseases are chronic.  **Some patients need high doses for many years while others can eventually reduce to maintenance doses of 10,000 IU daily** .

* (59:28) Beyond the protocol, patients should manage stress levels, get adequate rest, maintain physical activity, and follow a healthy lifestyle to reduce autoimmune disease risk factors.

#### [Coimbra Protocol: Multiple Sclerosis & Tumor Diseases | Dr. Petra Wiechel ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tos8UVtzmWs&t=29s) July 2024 29 minutes

* (00:00-00:45) Introduction to the "Coimbra Protocol," a revolutionary approach developed by Professor Coimbra, a neurologist at the University of St. Paul.

* (01:27-03:12) The protocol focuses on vitamin D's role in autoimmune diseases, particularly MS. Vitamin D affects 249 gene expressions per cell and controls hundreds of thousands of immune reactions, but modern lifestyles limit our sun exposure and vitamin D production.

* (04:07-05:37) Professor Coimbra discovered that increasing vitamin D dosage gradually (from 5,000 to 40,000+ units) can help MS patients by saturating cells with vitamin D, as people with autoimmune diseases have vitamin D receptor issues.

* (06:59-08:22) The protocol requires medical supervision and should not be attempted by laypeople. It involves careful monitoring and personalized dosing, which has reportedly helped many MS patients regain mobility.

* (09:18-10:49) Following the protocol requires dietary changes, particularly limiting calcium intake from dairy products, as vitamin D increases calcium absorption, which could potentially cause kidney issues if not monitored properly.

* (12:30-14:18) The protocol has shown benefits for various autoimmune conditions beyond MS, including psoriasis, vitiligo, and other neurodegenerative diseases, with dosages reaching up to 300,000 units per day in some cases.

* (16:42-19:26) Despite numerous studies on vitamin D's importance, there's a "knowledge resistance" in mainstream medicine. Many doctors don't routinely check vitamin D levels, though it was once common practice to supplement children.

* (20:10-22:37) Vitamin D supplementation can have dramatic effects on other conditions like depression. Dr. Wiechel recommends measuring vitamin D levels in March and October and supplementing accordingly.

* (23:26-25:41) Vitamin D acts like "police" in the body, helping natural killer cells recognize and  **eliminate cancer cells** . Studies show 30% fewer tumors in people with adequate vitamin D levels.

* (26:29-28:19) Conclusion encourages viewers to check their vitamin D levels and consider the Coimbra Protocol if dealing with MS or autoimmune conditions, emphasizing the importance of expert supervision.

#### [The Coimbra Protocols of Vitamin D in Managing Autoimmune Diseases, What is Vitamin D Resistance?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSd19bFhB7w&t=33s) 23 minutes Jan 2025

* (00:00) The Coimbra Protocol uses therapeutic doses of vitamin D to manage various autoimmune conditions including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, IBS, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes.

* (01:19) Autoimmune disorders involve either immunodeficiency (immune system too weak) or hypersensitivity (immune system misdirected), with 60-80 chronic inflammatory diseases affecting 5-8% of the US population, with 75% of cases occurring in women.

* (03:21) Autoimmunity can affect any organ system and has been dramatically increasing since the 1950s, with environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and vitamin D deficiency as major contributing factors.

* (09:52) A case study from Finland showed an inverse relationship between recommended vitamin D intake and type 1 diabetes incidence - as vitamin D recommendations decreased from 4,500 IU (1964) to 400 IU (1992), diabetes cases significantly increased.

* (11:39) Vitamin D modulates immune response by promoting a shift from Th1 to Th2, suppressing inflammatory Th17 reactions, and facilitating T-regulatory cells that balance immune response.

* (13:39) Vitamin D deficiency contributes to gut dysbiosis and leaky gut, which can trigger autoimmune responses; proper vitamin D supplementation helps reduce inflammation and strengthen gut barrier function.

* (16:39) Research shows that doubling serum vitamin D concentration decreases multiple sclerosis exacerbation rates by 27%, with similar benefits demonstrated for psoriasis, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.

* (19:54) Many autoimmune patients have "vitamin D resistance" due to genetic polymorphisms, requiring much higher therapeutic doses than typically recommended to achieve immunomodulatory effects.

* (21:43) Case studies show lesions in multiple sclerosis patients completely disappearing after high-dose vitamin D therapy, with Dr. Coimbra describing vitamin D deficiency as "a disaster for the immune system."
