#### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory response in patients with cancer and precancerous lesions: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials

Clin Nutr. 2023 May 17;S0261-5614(23)00151-6. [doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2023.05.009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2023.05.009)

Background & aims: Inflammation plays a key role in tumor development and progression. Vitamin D has potential tumor suppressing effects through modulation of inflammatory processes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to summarize and evaluate the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation (VID3S) on serum inflammatory biomarkers among patients with cancer or pre-cancerous lesions.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases until November 2022. The effects of VID3S were estimated from pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for inflammatory biomarker follow-up levels between intervention and control groups.

Results: Meta-analysis of eight RCTs (total of 592 patients with cancer or pre-cancerous conditions) showed that VID3S significantly lowered levels of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (SMD <span>[95%CI]</span>: -1.65 <span>[-3.07; -0.24]</span>). VID3S also resulted in statistically non-significantly lower serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 (SMD <span>[95%CI]</span>: -0.83, <span>[-1.78; 0.13]</span>) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD <span>[95%CI]</span>: -0.09, <span>[-0.35; 0.16]</span>), whereas IL-10 levels were unaltered (SMD <span>[95%CI]</span>: -0.00, <span>[-0.50; 0.49]</span>).

Conclusion: Our study shows evidence of a significant reduction of TNF-α levels by VID3S for patients with cancer or precancerous lesions. Patients with cancer or precancerous lesions may benefit from personalized VID3S in suppressing tumour-promoting inflammatory response.

#### Note: Many of the trials used too little vitamin D to be of any possible benefit
