Recalcitrant warts are refractory to treatment with often disappointing response and high recurrence rates. Lately, treatment with intralesional injections has gained momentum due to its effectiveness in clearing warts by stimulating the cell-mediated immunity. Vitamin D, when applied topically, regulates epidermal cell proliferation and is involved in the formation of antimicrobial peptides. We have attempted to use vitamin D3 to exploit its reported action as an immunotherapeutic molecule in addition to its topical effects. To our knowledge, there are no reports of intralesional vitamin D3 injections used in the treatment of extragenital recalcitrant warts.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>Sixty-four patients with recalcitrant warts of varying sizes and duration were included in the study. About 0.2- to 0.5-mL vitamin D3 solution (600,000 IU, 15 mg/mL) was injected to the base of the wart. A maximum of 5 warts were injected per session at 3-week intervals until resolution or for a maximum of 4 treatments. Patients were followed up for 6 months after the last injection to detect any recurrence.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Sixty patients completed the study. Complete response was seen in 54 of 60 (90%), partial response in 4 of 60 (6.66%), and no response in 2 of 60 (3.33%). The average number of injections required to achieve a complete resolution was 3.66. Complete resolution of distant warts was noticed in all patients.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Intralesional vitamin D3 is a safe, effective, and an inexpensive treatment option for recalcitrant warts.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-injection-cured-a-variety-of-warts-on-skin---2017-b>Vitamin D injection cured a variety of warts on skin - 2017 B</h4><p><strong>Safety and efficacy of intralesional vitamin D3 in cutaneous warts: An open uncontrolled trial</strong></p><p>J Cutan Aesthet Surg 2017;10:90-4 Year : 2017 | Volume : 10 | Issue : 2 | Page : 90-94</p><p>Manjunath Kavya, Basavapura Madegowda Shashikumar, Muddanahalli Rajegowda Harish, Bhadbhade P Shweta</p><p>Department of Skin and STD, Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences, Mandya, Karnataka, India</p><p><strong>Two images in study via Google Images</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/warts-b1.jpg alt=image width=500>
<img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/warts-b2.jpg alt=image width=500><p>Background: Cutaneous warts are treated primarily with destructive methods such as cryotherapy or electrocautery. These modalities of treatment are time-consuming and may be associated with scarring in multiple warts. Immunotherapy is emerging as a new modality of treatment which acts on enhancing cell-mediated immunity against human papillomavirus for clearance of both treated and distant warts.</p><p>Aims: This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intralesional Vitamin D3 for the treatment of cutaneous warts. Materials and Methods: Patients with multiple warts were selected for immunotherapy. Vitamin D3 (0.2 ml, 15 mg/ml) was injected to the base of warts after injecting with lignocaine (0.2 ml, 20 mg/ml). <strong>The injections were repeated 2 weeks apart for a maximum of 4 sessions or until complete clearance, whichever was earlier</strong> . A maximum of 2 warts were treated per session and patients were followed up for 6 months after the last injection.</p><p>Results: Forty-two patients with multiple warts were recruited for the study who completed the 6-month follow-up period and were available for analysis. Of these, 23 had palmoplantar warts, 18 had verruca vulgaris and 1 patient had filiform wart. In total, <strong>33 of 42 patients (78.57%) showed complete response</strong> , 6 patients (14.28%) showed moderate response and three patients (7.14%) showed mild response. Recurrence was observed in one patient with the palmoplantar wart. No serious adverse effects were reported. Limitations: Lack of control group was the main drawback in our study.</p><p>Conclusion: Intralesional Vitamin D3 is safe and effective for treatment of multiple cutaneous warts.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/wart-b.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=warts-eliminated-in-80-percent-of-those-getting-vitamin-d-injection--aug-2015>Warts eliminated in 80 percent of those getting vitamin D injection – Aug 2015</h4><ul><li><a href=/posts/warts-eliminated-by-vitamin-d-injections>Warts eliminated by vitamin D injections</a></li></ul><hr><h4 id=67-of-warts-cleared-by-vitamin-d-injections---jan-2020>67% of warts cleared by Vitamin D injections - Jan 2020</h4><p><strong>Comparative clinical study of the efficacy of intralesional MMR vaccine vs intralesional vitamin D injection in treatment of warts</strong></p><p>Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13272>https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13272</a></p><p>Dalia R.
