Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation can contribute greatly to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and progression of the disease. Recent literature highlights that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a kinase mutated in both autosomal-dominantly inherited and sporadic PD cases, modulates inflammation in response to different pathological stimuli. In this review, we outline the state of the art of LRRK2 functions in microglia cells and in neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we discuss the potential role of LRRK2 in cytoskeleton remodeling and vesicle trafficking in microglia cells under physiological and pathological conditions. We also hypothesize that LRRK2 mutations might sensitize microglia cells toward a pro-inflammatory state, which in turn results in exacerbated inflammation with consequent neurodegeneration.</p><p>PMID: 24655756</p><hr><h3 id=the-kinase-lrrk2-mutated-in-parkinsons-disease-is-required-for-vitamin-d3-and-phosphate-metabolism--june-2013>THE KINASE LRRK2, MUTATED IN PARKINSONS DISEASE, IS REQUIRED FOR VITAMIN D3 AND PHOSPHATE METABOLISM = June 2013</h3><p>Acta Physiologica 2013; Volume 207, Supplement 694, 92nd Annual Meeting of the German Physiological Society, 02/03/2013-05/03/2013, Heidelberg, Germany</p><p>Abstract number: O15</p><p>Mühlemann 1 R. , Minder 1 N., Bettoni 1 C., Ruminska 1 J., Daryadel 1 A., Schnitzbauer 1 U., Kumar 1 M., Mohebbi 1 N., Biber 1 J., Hernando 1 N., Rovelli 2 G., Shimshek 2 D., van der Putten 2 H., Wagner 1 *C.</p><p>1 University of Zurich, Institute of Physiology, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p>2 Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland</p><p>Mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase (LRRK2, Park8) underlie about 5 % of familial and 1-2 % of sporadic cases of Parkinson disease (PD). LRRK2 is almost ubiquitously expressed with particularly high levels in kidney, lung, and brain. The role of LRRK2, its up- and downstream regulators and targets are unknown. Here we show in mice either lacking Lrrk2 or expressing the G2019S mutant (the most common mutation in PD patients) and in rats deficient for LRRK2 that phosphate metabolism is highly disturbed. The levels of PTH, FGF23, and 1,25OH2-vitamin D3 are altered in all three animal models. Renal phosphate excretion is increased in animals lacking Lrrk2 and decreased in G2019S mutants. Expression of the vitamin D receptor and the vitamin D activating and inactivating enzymes Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1, as well as of klotho (coligand for FGF23) are altered in most organs expressing LRRK2. Changes in dietary phosphate intake in Lrrk2 WT and KO mice alter phosphate and vitamin D target genes in a LRRK2 dependent manner and application of vitamin D3 to wildtype mice increases LRRK2 expression. In vitro, inhibition of LRRK2 alters expression of Cyp24a1 and the intestinal phosphate transporter NaPiIIb. Our data suggest that LRRK2 plays a central role in regulating phosphate metabolism and hormones involved in its control.</p><hr><h3 id=genetic-insights-into-sporadic-parkinsons-disease-pathogenesis-dec-2013-pdf-attached>Genetic insights into sporadic Parkinson&rsquo;s disease pathogenesis.

Importantly, the functional characterization of these genes has shed considerable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. Collectively; these studies implicate aberrant protein and mitochondrial homeostasis as key contributors to the development of PD, with oxidative stress likely acting as an important nexus between the two pathogenic events. Interestingly, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed variations in at least two of the identified familial PD genes (i.e. α-synuclein and LRRK2) as significant risk factors for the development of sporadic PD. At the same time, the studies also uncovered variability in novel alleles that is associated with increased risk for the disease. Additionally, in-silico meta-analyses of GWAS data have allowed major steps into the investigation of the roles of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in sporadic PD. The emergent picture from the progress made thus far is that the etiology of sporadic PD is multi-factorial and presumably involves a complex interplay between a multitude of gene networks and the environment. Nonetheless, the biochemical pathways underlying familial and sporadic forms of PD are likely to be shared.</p><p>PMID: 24532982</p><hr><h3 id=review-of-early-onset-pd-and-gene-mutations--oct-2012>Review of Early onset PD and gene mutations – Oct 2012</h3><p><strong>_Systematic review and UK-based study of PARK2 (parkin), PINK1, PARK7 (DJ-1) and LRRK2 in early-onset Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</strong></p><p>Mov Disord. 2012 Oct;27(12):1522-9. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.25132.>doi: 10.1002/mds.25132.</a> Epub 2012 Sep 6.</p><p>Kilarski LL1, Pearson JP, Newsway V, Majounie E, Knipe MD, Misbahuddin A, Chinnery PF, Burn DJ, Clarke CE, Marion MH, Lewthwaite AJ, Nicholl DJ, Wood NW, Morrison KE, Williams-Gray CH, Evans JR, Sawcer SJ, Barker RA, Wickremaratchi MM, Ben-Shlomo Y, Williams NM, Morris HR.</p><p><strong>Approximately 3.6% of patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease develop symptoms before age 45.</strong> Early-onset Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (EOPD) patients have a higher familial recurrence risk than late-onset patients, and 3 main recessive EOPD genes have been described. We aimed to establish the prevalence of mutations in these genes in a UK cohort and in previous studies. We screened 136 EOPD probands from a high-ascertainment regional and community-based prevalence study for pathogenic mutations in PARK2 (parkin), PINK1, PARK7 (DJ-1), and exon 41 of LRRK2. We also carried out a systematic review, calculating the proportion of cases with pathogenic mutations in previously reported studies. We identified 5 patients with pathogenic PARK2, 1 patient with PINK1, and 1 with LRRK2 mutations. The rate of mutations overall was 5.1%. Mutations were more common in patients with age at onset (AAO) &lt; 40 (9.5%), an affected first-degree relative (6.9%), an affected sibling (28.6%), or parental consanguinity (50%). In our study EOPD mutation carriers were more likely to present with rigidity and dystonia, and 6 of 7 mutation carriers had lower limb symptoms at onset. Our systematic review included information from >5800 unique cases. Overall, the weighted mean proportion of cases with PARK2 (parkin), PINK1, and PARK7 (DJ-1) mutations was 8.6%, 3.7%, and 0.4%, respectively. PINK1 mutations were more common in Asian subjects. The overall frequency of mutations in known EOPD genes was lower than previously estimated. Our study shows an increased likelihood of mutations in patients with lower AAO, family history, or parental consanguinity.</p><p>Copyright © 2012 Movement Disorder Society.</p><p>PMID: 22956510</p><hr><h3 id=what-genetics-tells-us-about-the-causes-and-mechanisms-of-parkinsons-disease--oct-2011-pdf-attached>What genetics tells us about the causes and mechanisms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. – Oct 2011 PDF attached</h3><p>Physiol Rev. 2011 Oct;91(4):1161-218. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00022.2010.>doi: 10.1152/physrev.00022.2010.</a></p><p>Corti O1, Lesage S, Brice A.</p><p>1Université Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, Centre de Recherche de l&rsquo;Institut du Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale U.975, Paris, France.</p><p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is a common motor disorder of mysterious etiology. It is due to the progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and is accompanied by the appearance of intraneuronal inclusions enriched in α-synuclein, the Lewy bodies. It is becoming increasingly clear that genetic factors contribute to its complex pathogenesis. Over the past decade, the genetic basis of rare PD forms with Mendelian inheritance, representing no more than 10% of the cases, has been investigated. More than 16 loci and 11 associated genes have been identified so far; genome-wide association studies have provided convincing evidence that polymorphic variants in these genes contribute to sporadic PD. The knowledge acquired of the functions of their protein products has revealed pathways of neurodegeneration that may be shared between inherited and sporadic PD. An impressive set of data in different model systems strongly suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in clinically similar, early-onset autosomal recessive PD forms caused by parkin and PINK1, and possibly DJ-1 gene mutations.</p><p>In contrast, α-synuclein accumulation in Lewy bodies defines a spectrum of disorders ranging from typical late-onset PD to PD dementia and including sporadic and autosomal dominant PD forms due to mutations in SCNA and LRRK2.</p><p>However, the pathological role of Lewy bodies remains uncertain, as they may or may not be present in PD forms with one and the same LRRK2 mutation. Impairment of autophagy-based protein/organelle degradation pathways is emerging as a possible unifying but still fragile pathogenic scenario in PD. Strengthening these discoveries and finding other convergence points by identifying new genes responsible for Mendelian forms of PD and exploring their functions and relationships are the main challenges of the next decade. It is also the way to follow to open new promising avenues of neuroprotective treatment for this devastating disorder.</p><p>PMID: 22013209</p><hr><h3 id=what-genetics-tells-us-about-the-causes-decreased-in-rats-with-curcumin-lrrk2-gene--jan-2010>What genetics tells us about the causes decreased in rats with curcumin (LRRK2 gene) – Jan 2010</h3><p><strong>Curcumin exposure induces expression of the Parkinson&rsquo;s disease-associated leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in rat mesencephalic cells.</strong></p><p>Neurosci Lett. 2010 Jan 4;468(2):120-4.

While it is likely that many of these are truly pathogenic mutations, proof of pathogenicity is difficult, and only 5 LRRK2 mutations (G2019S, R1441C, R1441G, I2020T, and Y1699C) are unequivocally linked to disease based on disease segregation in large families and functional studies.<sup>[4, 5, 6, 7]</sup></p><p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p><p>Comprehensive mutation screening has shown that frequencies of LRRK2 mutations vary significantly across different ethnic groups. A good example is the G2019S mutation, the most common LRRK2 mutation in Caucasian populations. Within outbred Caucasian populations, this single change is believed to underlie approximately 5% of PD cases with a family history of PD and approximately 2% of apparently sporadic PD cases,<sup>[8, 9]</sup> thus accounting for approximately half of all LRRK2 mutations in these populations.</p><p>In Ashkenazi Jewish communities, about 40% of familial and 13% of sporadic cases carry this mutation, and, in North African Berber Arabs, the frequency is even higher; specifically, 39% of familial cases and 40% of sporadic cases. In contrast, in Asian populations, this mutation is only rarely detected.<sup>[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]</sup> Of note, genetic data point toward a single founder for the vast majority of the G2019S PD cases.<sup>[15]</sup></p><p><strong>Genetic risk modifiers</strong></p><p>In addition to the above-mentioned disease-causing mutations characterized by segregation with disease in large families, there are 2 lines of evidence that support the idea that the LRRK2 locus also contains risk-modifying variants. The first line of evidence comes from studies within Asian populations showing that 2 protein-coding variants, G2385R and R1628P, increase the risk for PD approximately 2-fold; these mutations are present at a frequency of approximately 6% in cases, and approximately half that in controls.<sup>[16, 17]</sup></p><p>The second line of evidence comes from genome-wide association studies that implicate noncoding variants close to LRRK2 with altered risk for PD and that suggest this risk may be mediated by altering the expression and/or splicing of LRRK2.<sup>[18]</sup></p><p><strong>Penetrance</strong></p><p>The penetrance of LRRK2 mutations has been a topic of intense study and debate.</p><p>The most parsimonious models employ age-based penetrance estimates, which suggest that the <strong>G2019S</strong> mutation has a penetrance of</p><ul><li><p>28% at age 59 years,</p></li><li><p>51% at age 69 years, and</p></li><li><p>74% at age 79 years.</p></li></ul><p>For the <strong>R1441G</strong> change, a mutation with high prevalence in the Basque population, penetrance estimates are</p><ul><li><p>13% at age 65 years, increasing to</p></li><li><p>83% at age 80 years.<sup>[19, 20]</sup></p></li></ul><p>Penetrance estimates have not been established for other LRRK2 mutations.</p><p><strong>Disease presentation</strong></p><p>Clinically, the presentation of typical LRRK2 -related PD is indistinguishable from idiopathic PD with late-onset, levodopa-responsive parkinsonism.</p><p>In some cases, however, atypical features have been observed, including the following <sup>[2, 15, 21, 22]</sup> :</p><p>Early disease onset</p><p>Amyotrophy</p><p>Dementia</p><p>Hallucinations</p><p>Delusions</p><p>Dystonia of lower extremities</p><p>Variability also exists with respect to the neuropathology, ranging from Lewy body PD to nigral degeneration without distinctive histopathology, or tau-positive neurofibrillary tangle pathology.<sup>[2, 23]</sup></p><p><strong>Clinical Implications and Genetic Testing</strong></p><p>To date, knowledge about LRRK2 -mutation status does not alter therapeutic management, since targeted, neuroprotective therapies are still at an experimental stage. Clinical implications are, therefore, limited to the identification of mutation carriers for research studies. Thus, routine genetic testing for LRRK2 mutations remains a controversial topic; this is particularly true when testing of asymptomatic relatives of PD patients is considered.</p><p>Within the context of a research study, information on the ethnic background of a proband allows testing for mutations that are most prevalent in that ethnic population, thereby avoiding excessive and costly screening. In individuals of Caucasian, Ashkenazi Jewish, or North African Berber ancestry, testing for the G2019S mutation would be recommended, while patients of Spanish or Hispanic descent should also be evaluated for R1441G mutations. Given the limited knowledge on clinical consequences of the common risk-modifying variants G2385R and R1628P, genetic screening for these mutations should not be encouraged.</p><p>PD associated with LRRK2 mutations is an autosomal-dominant disease. It therefore follows that each child of an LRRK2 mutation carrier has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. However, due to incomplete penetrance, only a fraction of these individuals will develop disease, and age is the main risk factor influencing disease penetrance.</p><p>Current therapy for PD focuses on drugs that manage the symptoms but do not affect the disease progression. Research is being conducted that involves inhibitors of kinases (enzymes that regulate cellular signaling) and how they may affect the neurologic pathways associated with PD. Unfortunately, at this time, the repeated failure of neuroprotective drugs in animal models suggests that there are likely multiple processes involved. A coalescing molecular pathway for the disease still remains elusive.<sup>[24, 25, 26]</sup></p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li><p>Funayama M, Hasegawa K, Kowa H, Saito M, Tsuji S, Obata F.
