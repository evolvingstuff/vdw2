Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men with > 1,100,000 new cases and 300,000 deaths worldwide each year. The disease is more common among older men, with a median age at diagnosis around age above 60 years. Prostate cancer is a major medical problem that needs immediate attention as the disease is indolent, shows prolonged latency in association with high morbidity and mortality. Administration of diagnostic tests including PSA test and biopsies and the advances in other diagnostic procedures have led to early detection of the disease with therapeutic steps being taken early on, there has been a steady decline in the disease-specific mortality. Global incidence and mortality rates show that the disease is  **more prevalent among black people,**  even though the differences cannot be attributed entirely to race, as the influence of socioeconomic situation and the resultant limited access to medical technologies and treatment could not be ruled out completely. Several genes have been identified that when mutated confer high risk for the disease. Besides the genetic factors, family history and nutritional factors such as lack of enough vitamin D, high intake of calcium,  **obesity**  and high fat diets have been implicated as risk factors for prostate cancer. Therapeutic measures for prostate cancer involve mostly radical prostatectomy followed by radiotherapy in combination with hormonal treatment as needed.

 **Portion of PDF which concentrates on Obesity as well as Vitamin D** 

"Obesity was found to be associated with increased incidence of aggressive prostate cancer as well as prostate cancer recurrence. Prostate cancer-specific mortality is also likely to be elevated significantly by obesity33. The overall evidence for a protective role of vitamin D against prostate cancer is weak, when only the circulating levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D are considered without the inclusion of genetic factors 34. However, in areas where there is higher probability of vitamin D deficiency, such as high latitude regions, there appears to be stronger link between vitamin D status and prostate cancer incidence 35. Considering the relatively shorter (3 weeks) half life of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in blood, the studies on the association of serum vitamin D and prostate cancer need to be examined cautiously, as the levels of vitamin D measured may not reflect either the risk or the onset of prostate cancer."
