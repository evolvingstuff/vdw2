### Vitamin D and chronic widespread pain in a white middle-aged British population: evidence from a cross-sectional population survey

Ann Rheum Dis 2009;68:817-822 doi:10.1136/ard.2008.090456

 **Background:** Identified aetiological factors for chronic widespread pain (CWP) are largely related to emotional and behavioural factors, but current management leads to modest improvement in symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency has been suggested as a new modifiable risk factor for CWP.

 **Objective:**  To examine the association between vitamin D status (measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)) and CWP in a nationwide population sample of white British adults, accounting for potential mediating and confounding lifestyle factors.

Methods: 9377 participants born 1 week in March 1958, in England, Scotland or Wales and completing a biomedical assessment at age 45; 6824 eligible participants had data on 25(OH)D and completed pain manikins.

 **Results:**  Prevalence of CWP varied by 25(OH)D concentration in women but not in men, with the lowest prevalence observed for women with 

* 14.4% for <25 nmol/l, 

* 14.8% for 25–49 nmol/l, 

* 11.6% for 50–74 nmo/l, 

* 8.2% for 75–99 nmol/l and 

* 9.8% for participants with ?100 nmol/l). 

There was an interaction between 25(OH)D concentration and gender in relation to CWP (interaction, p?=?0.006), which was not fully explained by differences in lifestyle or social factors (adjusted interaction, p?=?0.03). For women, the association between 25(OH)D concentration and CWP persisted after full adjustment (odds ratio (OR) for <75 nmol/l vs 75–99 nmol/l 1.57, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.26), while no evidence for an association was apparent in men (OR?=?1.03, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.43).

 **Conclusion:**  Current vitamin D status  **was associated with CWP in women but not in men.**  

Follow-up studies are needed to evaluate whether higher vitamin D intake might have beneficial effects on the risk of CWP.
