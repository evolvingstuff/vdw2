#### The effects of magnesium supplementation in diets with different calcium levels on the bone status and bone metabolism in growing female rats.

Biol Trace Elem Res. 2013 Dec;155(3):431-8. [doi: 10.1007/s12011-013-9798-1.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-013-9798-1.)

Previous studies have revealed that magnesium (Mg) plays a significant role in bone health; however, few studies have investigated the effects of Mg supplementation in diets with different calcium (Ca) levels on the bone status and bone metabolism in a growing stage. In this present study, we tested the effects of Mg supplementation on bone status in growing female rats, relative to Ca intake levels. A total of 40 Sprague-Dawley female rats aged 6 weeks were divided into the following four groups and fed for 12 weeks as indicated: 

* (1) LCaAMg: low Ca (Ca, 0.1 % of total diet) and adequate Mg (Mg, 0.05 % of total diet), 

* (2) LCaHMg: low Ca and high Mg (  **Mg, 0.1 % of total diet** ), 

* (3) ACaAMg: adequate Ca (Ca, 0.5 % of total diet) and adequate Mg, and 

* (4) ACaHMg: adequate Ca and high Mg. 

Our results showed that Mg supplementation with the adequate Ca diet significantly increased the 

* bone mineral contents, 

* bone size (bone area and bone thickness), and 

* bone mineral density of femur or tibia 

> by improving bone metabolism without changing Ca absorption. 

Mg supplementation significantly increased the serum osteocalcin in the adequate-Ca-diet group (p < 0.05), while the Mg supplementation significantly decreased the serum level of C-telopeptide cross-links of type I collagen in the adequate-Ca-diet group (p < 0.001). This study suggests that Mg supplementation with adequate Ca intake in the growing stage may increase the bone mineral density and bone size by improving bone metabolism.

1 lbs (assumed) X 0.1% = .001 lbs

Since there are 454 grams per pound

Magnesium = 454 gram
