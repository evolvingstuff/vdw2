#### Typical Pregnancy Now 39 Weeks, Not 40

* [WebMD – March of Dimes](http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20060323/typical-pregnancy-now-39-weeks-not-40#1)  2006

> “The most common length of a pregnancy in the U.S. is a week shorter than it was  **just over a decade ago** , dropping from 40 weeks to 39 weeks, according to a new analysis from the March of Dimes”

> Possible reasons postulated includes better fetal monitoring, obesity, and maternal age

> No mention of increased Omega-6 which blocks Omega-3

 **Highlights** 

* N-3 PUFA improves maternal and neonatal health, and increases gestation length.

* N-3 PUFA inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines that are vital at early and late gestation.

* Cytokine profile in the uterus during pregnancy may affect pregnancy establishment and outcomes.

* Effects of n-3 PUFA on different stages of pregnancy needs to be established.

Emerging evidence suggests that omega (n)-3 PUFA and their metabolites improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes by modifying gestation length, and reducing the recurrence of pre-term delivery. N-3 PUFA has been associated with prolonged gestation and increased birth dimensions such as birth weight and head circumference. However, mothers giving birth to larger babies are at an increased risk of having dysfunctional labour, genital tract laceration, and delivery via caesarean section. Likewise, high infant weight at birth has been linked to several metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in the offspring. Prolonged gestation also leads to reduced placental function which has been implicated in fetal distress, and perinatal death. Till date, the mechanism through which high n-3 PUFA intake during pregnancy increases gestation length and birth weight is vaguely understood. Early and later stages of pregnancy is characterised by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are required for pregnancy establishment and labour regulation respectively. Conversely, mid-stage of pregnancy requires anti-inflammatory cytokines necessary for uterine quiescence, pregnancy maintenance and optimal fetal growth. Apparently, changes in the profiles of local cytokines in the uterus during different stages of pregnancy have a profound effect on pregnancy progression. This review focuses on the intake of n-3 and n-6 PUFA during pregnancy and the impact it has on gestation length and infant weight at birth, with a particular emphasis on the expression of inflammatory cytokines required for timely pregnancy establishment (embryo reception and implantation) and labour induction. It is concluded that an appropriate dose of n-3 and n-6 PUFA needs to be established during different stages of pregnancy.

Women supplemented with high n-3 PUFA had their gestation

length extended by 6 days <sup>[34]</sup> and 8.3 days longer in high risk pregnancies <sup>[35]</sup>

Of keen interest in the intervention studies is the observation

that n-3 PUFA treatment were generally administered after the

pregnancy had been established (Table 2). Data from observational

studies, where mothers consumed  **high amount of n-3 PUFA prior to conception** , 

revealed a significantly higher infant weight at birth.

Corrected average birth weight among Faroese woman was

3610 ± 603 g, and the frequency of having new born infants heavier

than 4.5 kg was 3  **(three) times higher**  than Denmark where n-3

PUFA consumption was very low <sup>[73]</sup>. It can therefore be argued

that n-3 PUFA supplementation at the early stage of pregnancy may

have a significant influence on gestation length and other pregnancy outcomes; 

perhaps by regulating pregnancy establishment activities, leading to gestation

length prolongation and consequently high infant weight at birth.

#### Omega-3 restored 2 days to pregnancies - RCT April 2019

 **Fish Oil Supplementation in Pregnancy Increases Gestational Age, Size for Gestational Age, and Birth Weight in Infants: A Randomized Controlled Trial.** 

J Nutr. 2019 Apr 1;149(4):628-634. [doi: 10.1093/jn/nxy204.](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy204.)

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have reported that supplementation with n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in pregnancy can prolong pregnancy and thereby increase birth weight.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the relations of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnancy with duration of pregnancy, birth weight, and size for gestational age (GA).

METHODS: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in 736 pregnant women and their offspring, from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010cohort. They were recruited between weeks 22 and 26 in pregnancy and randomly assigned to either of  **2.4 g n-3 LCPUFA**  or control (olive oil) daily until 1 wk after birth. Exclusion criteria were endocrine, cardiovascular, or nephrologic disorders and vitamin D supplementation intake >600 IU/d. In this study we analyzed secondary outcomes, and further excluded twin pregnancies and extrauterine death. The primary outcome for the trial was persistent wheeze or asthma.

RESULTS: The random assignment ran between 2008 and 2010. Six hundred and ninety-nine mother-infant pairs were included in the analysis. n-3 LCPUFA compared with control was associated with a  **2-d prolongation of pregnancy**  <span>[median (IQR): 282 (275-288) d compared with 280 (273-286) d, P = 0.02]</span>, a 97-g higher birth weight (mean ± SD: 3601 ± 534 g compared with 3504 ± 528 g, P = 0.02), and an increased size for GA according to the Norwegian population-based growth curves-Skjærven (mean ± SD: 49.9 ± 28.3 percentiles compared with 44.5 ± 27.6 percentiles, P = 0.01).

CONCLUSION: Supplementing pregnant women with n-3 LCPUFAs during the third trimester is associated with prolonged gestation and increased size for GA, leading to a higher birth weight in this randomized controlled trial. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00798226.
