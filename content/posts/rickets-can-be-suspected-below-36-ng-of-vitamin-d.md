OBJECTIVE: To study the role of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the early diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency rickets.

METHODS: Concentrations of serum 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase were measured in normal control (n=73), suspected rickets (n=45) and confirmed rickets groups (n=65). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum 25(OH)D for rickets.

RESULTS:  **Serum 25(OH)D levels in the suspected and confirmed rickets groups were 83±30 and 72±31 nmol/L**  respectively, which was lower than in the normal control group (112±37 nmol/L) (P<0.01). There was no significant difference between the suspected and confirmed rickets groups (P>0.05). Vitamin D deficiency rates in the suspected and confirmed rickets groups were higher than in the control group (P<0.01). The ROC curve area of serum 25(OH)D for the diagnosis of rickets was 0.760 (95%CI 0.692-0.820, P<0.01), and the optimal operating point was 90.70 nmol/L (sensitivity 68.49%, specificity 72.73%). There was no significant difference in levels of calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase between the three groups (P>0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D levels in infants with suspected and confirmed rickets are significantly reduced and this may reflect vitamin D deficiency . Therefore, it may be useful to check serum 25(OH)D levels in screening for rickets.

Weaving organ function  J. The rickets diagnosis based on dimensional

Lack of vitamin D intake history and clinical manifestations, and further confirmed by the carpal bone X-ray and blood biochemical tests. The early clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations are the lack of specificity and sensitivity. The pathogenesis of rickets is vitamin D deficiency caused by calcium and phosphorus metabolism disorders, leading to a series of pathological changes. So, whether through the monitoring of vitamin D

Level of early diagnosis is worth studying. In addition a large number of $ clinical findings have been confirmed by clinical manifestations and wrist X-ray rickets in children

Serum 25 (OH) D levels were normal. Thus serum 25 (OH) D testing

For the rickets diagnosis still make sense, need to be further explored.

In this study, the analysis of serum 25 (OH) D concentration, to explore its significance in the early diagnosis of rickets and problems of, and access to the critical point of the diagnostic value of clinical application of the indicators to carry out the diagnosis and treatment of rickets provide the basis for .

3 Discussion

Rickets diagnosis of multiple serum markers as calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase, but the lack of specificity and sensitivity <span>[7-8]</span>, this study also confirmed this point. This may be related to the role of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, the latter two collaborative vitamin D to maintain the body's calcium and phosphorus balance. 25 (OH) D has the features of high concentration, stability and long half-life, is considered an important indicator to reflect the body's vitamin D metabolism <sup>[9]</sup>, serum 25 (OH) D detection diagnostic value of rickets more and more attention . The this study rickets serum 25 (OH) D level of 72 ± 31 nmollL higher than that of vitamin D deficiency (<50nmol / L) of the diagnostic criteria. Combined with the object of study of medical history, consider primarily related to health care workers and parents of rickets prevention knowledge to understand fully and actively its taking vitamin D supplements related to the baby after birth. Confirmed in the regular, long-term medical environment to add vitamin D, rickets in children with serum 25 (OH) D7 level also increased. Nevertheless, rickets serum 25 (OH) D levels are still significantly lower than the control group, indicating that serum 25 (OH) D levels decreased still prompt the baby may occur rickets a more reliable indicator. ROC curve can be used as a diagnostic method in clinical epidemiology accuracy evaluation index. AUC - like the diagnostic value lower than 0.9 means that a higher diagnostic value between 0.5-0.7. The results of this study serum 25 (OH) D AUC = 0.760, showed that serum 25 (OH) D detection of some diagnostic value. It is noteworthy that the suspicious group and rickets serum 25 (OH) D level was no significant difference, suggesting in typical rickets before, already exists in children, even vitamin D deficiency may be a long time. Further illustrate the serum 25 (OH) D levels decreased for the early detection of rickets significant. At this point, even better than the classic X line. Because the latter can be displayed only when the bone mass loss of 30% to 50% decrease in bone mineral content <span>[W]</span>.

Researchers refer to the majority of expert consensus as vitamin D nutritional status evaluation criteria <sup>[1115]</sup>: serum 25 (OH) D levels <50 nmoZL vitamin D deficiency, 50 -75 nmoZL lack of vitamin D, 75 nmoZL sufficient. 2011, published by the American College of Endocrinology vitamin D deficiency assessment, treatment, and prevention of clinical practice guidelines recommend serum 25 (OH) D levels <50 nmoZL diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency <sup>[16]</sup>. In fact, no such study in children serum 25 (OH) D the normal uniform standards. Due to the experimental method, latitude, season and vitamin D intake persons and other factors, countries, different children around the serum 25 (OH) D level <span>[17-23]</span>. Which is the limit of the check in the pediatric clinical wider application of one of the factors. Diagnosed rickets in children in this study only 31% (20/65) consistent with vitamin D deficiency, to

ROC curve select the best critical point for a detection means to achieve maximum sensitivity and specificity, while reducing the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rate. In this study, 90 7 nmoZL as the diagnostic value of the critical point of view from a sensitivity of 68.49% and 72.73% specificity, there are certain clinical value. Both as soon as possible to prevent and detect the occurrence of rickets, it will not increase the psychological and economic burden of the parents. Due to a limited number of the observed object, needed more time large-scale & randomized, controlled trials testing. Recent Liangguan Yu et al <sup>[24]</sup> proposed Nanjing 0-10 age group children, serum 25 'OH) D level 50 -60 nmoZL may be the optimal concentration to maintain normal bone metabolism, in addition to still rare in the open literature reports of national laboratories establish its own reference range.

In summary, with the prevention of health literacy, domestic severe rickets is rare, early or atypical rickets is more common. Serum 25 (OH) D level of testing for the detection of early rickets and
