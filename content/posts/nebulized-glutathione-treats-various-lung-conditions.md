#### The use of nebulized glutathione to treat lung conditions - Perplexity AI - Deep Research March 2025

 **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nebulized-glutathione-therapy-for-respiratory-cond-compresspdf.pdf">Perplexity Report</a>** 

 **Clipped from the Report** 

 **For patients with <span style="color:#00F;">COPD, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or environmental exposures,</span> nebulized glutathione may offer benefits with an acceptable safety profile. However, for <span style="color:#00F;">asthma </span>patients, particularly those with sulfite sensitivities, the risk of severe bronchoconstriction necessitates careful screening and potential pretreatment with bronchodilators.**
