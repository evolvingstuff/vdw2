Aims:

We aimed to study the vitamin D status of the population of Arkhangelsk, a city in northwestern Russia.

Methods:

A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate serum 25(OH)D concentrations in Arkhangelsk residents, including 55 neonates and their mothers, 214 children <3 years, 191 schoolchildren (7–8 years), 403 adolescents (13–17 years), 260 university students (18–22 years) and 85 adults (24–60 years). The data were collected from March 2013 to November 2014 and from January 2016 to May 2016.

Results:

Normal levels of 25(OH)D (>30 ng/ml) were found in 5% of neonates, 43% of their mothers, 43% of children <3 years, 9% of schoolchildren, 1% of adolescents, 17% of students and 26% of adults. There was a moderate positive correlation (rs = 0.563, p = 0.001) between 25(OH)D levels in mother’s blood and umbilical cord blood.

Conclusions:

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the population of Arkhangelsk, particularly in neonates, schoolchildren and adolescents.
