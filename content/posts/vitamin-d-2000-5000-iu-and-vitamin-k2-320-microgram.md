#### [The Vitamin D and Vitamin K2 Connection: Understanding the Mechanisms, What to Test, and How Much D3 and K2 to Take](https://info.dralexrinehart.com/articles/vitamin-d-and-vitamin-k2-benefits-connection) Dr. Alex Rinehart

* Recommends Vitamin D 40-80 ng/mL, with 50-70ng/mL being an even more optimal sweet spot

* “Once calcium is absorbed or released in the blood, it still needs to be told where to go! That is why vitamin K2 status is crucial to healthy calcium balance in the body.”

* “K2-4 is only available as a synthetic supplement and metabolized quickly by the body. The longer K2-7 is non-synthetic & stays in your blood for 24-72 hours. K2-7 can be taken once daily to maintain K2 levels, whereas K2-4 is taken a few times per day.”

* “If you're looking for a baseline recommendation for D3 and K2 supplementation. 2000-5000 IU of D3 ("cholecalciferol) and up to 320mcg/day of vitamin K2-7 (found in Megaquinone K2-7) are popular and safe ways to go as long as you're periodically checking at least your 25-OH vitamin D levels (storage; calcidiol).”

* He uses active Vitamin D as an indicator of Vitamin K2 needs
