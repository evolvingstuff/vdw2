 **Some other factors that are known to decrease the ability to convert dietary vitamin D to 25-VitD:** 

* Polyunsaturated fats can decrease the bioavailability of vitamin D

* Fluoride (which is present in many pet foods and water supplies) 

> decreases magnesium, which is an essential cofactor for vitamin D

* Strong magnetic fields can reduce vitamin D levels

* PCBs increase the risk of deficiency by 3%

* Roundup (glyphosate, which is present in foods and the environment) decreases vitamin D

* Flame retardants (which are 10 times higher in dogs than humans) inactivate vitamin D

* Low magnesium in foods

* Spay/Neuter (spayed females have 10% less 25VitD than intact females and neutered males have  **30% less than intact males** )

* Kidney disease (prevents the conversion of 25VitD to the usable form of vitamin D)

* Exposure to DDT and other pesticides

* Certain drugs (as well as St Johns wort and mineral oil) can consume or block vitamin D
