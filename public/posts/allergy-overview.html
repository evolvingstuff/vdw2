Several studies have explored this relationship, indicating that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in the development of food allergies, including peanut allergy.</p><p><strong>Evidence Supporting the Association</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Australian Study</strong> :</li></ol><blockquote><p>An Australian study found that infants with low vitamin D levels were more likely to have egg or peanut allergies and multiple allergies compared to those with normal vitamin D levels. This suggests that vitamin D might have a protective role against the development of food allergies.</p></blockquote><ol><li><strong>Role of Vitamin D in Immune Function</strong> :</li></ol><blockquote><p>Vitamin D is known to play a crucial role in the immune system. It helps modulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which are essential in preventing allergic reactions. Deficiency in vitamin D has been associated with increased autoimmunity and susceptibility to infections, which could indirectly contribute to the development of allergies.</p></blockquote><ol><li><strong>Geographical and Seasonal Variations</strong> :</li></ol><blockquote><p>Research has shown that areas with lower ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which results in lower vitamin D synthesis, have higher rates of childhood food allergies, including peanut allergy. Additionally, being born in seasons with less UVR exposure (autumn or winter) has been linked to a higher risk of food allergies and anaphylaxis.</p></blockquote><ol><li><strong>Direct Measures of Vitamin D</strong> :</li></ol><blockquote><p>Studies using direct measures of vitamin D from blood samples have shown an association between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of allergic sensitization in children and adolescents, as well as food allergies in infants.</p></blockquote><ol><li><strong>Specific Study on Peanut Allergy</strong> :</li></ol><blockquote><p>A study by Mullins et al. found that higher neonatal 25(OH)D levels were associated with a reduced risk of peanut allergy in children. Specifically, levels of 75 to 99.9 nmol/L were linked to a reduced risk, while levels lower than 50 nmol/L did not show a significant difference from the reference group.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Contradictory Findings</strong></p><p>While there is substantial evidence supporting the association between low vitamin D and increased risk of food allergies, including peanut allergy, some studies have presented contradictory findings. For example, some research suggests that higher vitamin D levels might increase the likelihood of allergic sensitization and food allergies. This indicates the need for further well-designed randomized controlled trials to clarify the relationship.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Overall, the current body of research suggests that there might be an association between low vitamin D levels and an increased risk of peanut allergy. However, the relationship is complex and not entirely understood, with some studies showing contradictory results. Ensuring adequate vitamin D levels through sensible sun exposure and dietary intake might be beneficial, but more research is needed to establish definitive guidelines and understand the underlying mechanisms</p><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/might-peanut-allergy-be-associ-9N7hNAqZRiu.daUILvceZg>Perplexty references, images, videos</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=7-of-many-studies-about-egg-or-peanut-allergy-and-vitamin-d---july-2024>7 of many studies about egg or peanut allergy and Vitamin D - July 2024</h3><ul><li><p>Association of food allergy in children with vitamin D insufficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis - Feb 2023 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-023-04843-2>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-023-04843-2</a> <strong>YES</strong></p></li><li><p>A narrative review of vitamin D and food allergy in infants and children - Oct. 2021 [doi: <a href=https://doi.org/%5B10.21037/tp-21-396>10.21037/tp-21-396</a>|FREE PDF]</p><ul><li>" A lot of laboratory studies have confirmed that vitamin D is involved in the immune regulation of food allergy.

Epidemiological evidence from the past decade suggests a role of vitamin D in food allergy pathogenesis. Links have been made between variations in sunlight exposure, latitude, birth season and vitamin D status with food allergy risk. Despite the heightened interest in vitamin D in food allergies, it remains unclear by which exact mechanism(s) it acts. An understanding of the roles vitamin D plays within the immune system at the cellular and genetic levels, as well as the interplay between the microbiome and vitamin D, will provide insight into the importance of the vitamin in food allergies. Here, we discuss the effect of vitamin D on immune cell maturation, differentiation and function; microbiome; genetic and epigenetic regulation (eg DNA methylation); and how these processes are implicated in food allergies.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/food-allergies-and-vitamin-d-and-genes.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h2 id=rti-36-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-during-pregnancy---meta-analysis---may-2018>RTI 36% more likely if low Vitamin D during pregnancy - meta-analysis - May 2018</h2><p><strong>Prenatal vitamin D status and respiratory and allergic outcomes in childhood: A meta-analysis of observational studies.</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/rti-meta.jpg alt=image width=400><p>Pediatric allergy and immunology, DOI:10.1111/pai.12876</p><p>not on sci-hub as of Jan 2019 <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/wiley/prenatal-vitamin-d-status-and-respiratory-and-allergic-outcomes-in-em4sq4Sa03?articleList=%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3D%2522Prenatal%2Bvitamin%2BD%2Bstatus%2Band%2Brespiratory%2Band%2Ballergic%2Boutcomes%2Bin%2Bchildhood%2522">but can be read in DeepDive</a></p><p>Rosa M Pacheco-González, L Garcia-Marcos, Eva Morales</p><p>BACKGROUND: Prenatal vitamin D status may influence offspring&rsquo;s respiratory and allergic outcomes; however, evidence is inconclusive.

Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.</p><p>RESULTS: A total of 34 from 547 retrieved articles were included. Increased prenatal exposure to 25(OH)D was inversely associated with risk of RTIs. Comparing the highest with the lowest category of 25(OH)D levels, the pooled odds ratio was <strong>0.64</strong> (95% CI 0.47, 0.87). A positive borderline association was found for lung function at school age (FEV1 z-score coefficient 0.07, 95% CI -0.01, 0.15). No associations were found for wheeze, asthma, atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization.</p><p>CONCLUSION: The introduction of public health measures to tackle vitamin D status in pregnancy may reduce the burden of RTIs in offspring.
