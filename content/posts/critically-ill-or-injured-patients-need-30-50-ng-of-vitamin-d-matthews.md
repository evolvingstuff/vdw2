 **[Vitamin D, trauma, and blacks - Dr. Matthews interview with transcript - Jan 2019](/posts/vitamin-d-trauma-and-blacks-dr-matthews-interview-with-transcript) notes** 

* Grady (where he works) is one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the entire United States

* He works between 80 to 100 hours a week

* 98.8% of our ICU patients were vitamin D deficient

* Interviewer: So vitamin D works sort of across the board in helping you survive whatever it is that is wrong with you

* I've had to go as high as like 70 to 80 on some patients to get the proper response

* UN presentation – They had never heard anything, how vitamin D can affect the whole nation, the country, the world, or the world health organizations. So they had no clue

* US…can probably save over $800 Billion a year if we got everybody's vitamin D level above 40

* Vitamin D is “most common nutritional deficiency in the world”

* Many blacks believe that they get more VItamin D from the sun, rather than 5X less
