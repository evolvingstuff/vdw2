&lt;p>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) uses a photosensitizing drug in combination with visible light to kill cancer cells. PDT has an advantage over surgery or ionizing radiation because PDT can eliminate tumors without causing fibrosis or scarring. Disadvantages include the dual need for drug and light, and a generally lower efficacy for PDT versus surgery. This minireview describes basic principles of PDT, photosensitizers available, and aspects of tumor biology that may provide further opportunities for treatment optimization. An emerging biomodulatory approach, using methotrexate or Vitamin D in combination with aminolevulinate-based PDT, is described. Finally, current clinical uses of PDT for solid malignancies are reviewed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D Deficiency may be an Independent Risk Factor for Arterial Disease</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-may-be-an-independent-risk-factor-for-arterial-disease.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-may-be-an-independent-risk-factor-for-arterial-disease.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg. 2012 Jul 25.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Background: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD and vascular disease are etiologically linked. Evidence suggests deficiencies of vitamins D and K may adversely affect the cardiovascular system, but data from longitudinal studies are lacking. We hypothesized that deficiencies of vitamins D and K may be associated with incident CKD and/or incident albuminuria amongst members of the general population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cystic fibrosis helped with single dose of 250,000 IU of vitamin D – RCT</title><link>/posts/cystic-fibrosis-helped-with-single-dose-of-250000-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cystic-fibrosis-helped-with-single-dose-of-250000-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;pre style="background-color: #e0e0e0; white-space: pre-wrap;">

!!!Impact of vitamin D supplementation on markers of inflammation in adults with cystic fibrosis hospitalized for a pulmonary exacerbation
Short Communication; European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , (18 July 2012) | doi:10.1038/ejcn.2012.82

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic lung infection and inflammation leading to respiratory failure. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with CF, and correction of vitamin D deficiency may improve innate immunity and reduce inflammation in patients with CF. We conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of high-dose vitamin D to assess the impact of vitamin D therapy on antimicrobial peptide concentrations and markers of inflammation. 

We randomized 30 adults with CF hospitalized with a pulmonary exacerbation to 250?000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo, and evaluated changes in plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers and the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 at baseline and 12 weeks post intervention. In the vitamin D group, there was a 
*50.4% reduction in tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) at 12 weeks (P&amp;lt;0.01), 
*and there was a trend for a 64.5% reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P=0.09). 
There were no significant changes in 
*IL-1?, 
*IL-8, 
*IL-10, 
*IL-18BP and 
*NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin). 
We conclude that a large bolus dose of vitamin D is associated with reductions in two inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-?. 
This study supports the concept that vitamin D may help regulate inflammation in CF, and that further research is needed to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved and the impact on clinical outcomes.

Ziegler and Vin Tangpricha \n\nBackground: Vitamin D insufficiency is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and vitamin D repletion may have an important role in improving clinical outcomes in CF. This randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study examined the feasibility and impact of a single, large dose of cholecalciferol on vitamin D status and clinical outcomes in subjects with CF.\n\nMethods: Thirty adults with were randomized in a double-blinded, pilot study to receive 250,000 IU cholecalciferol or placebo within 48 h of hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), clinical outcomes and potential adverse events were assessed up to 1-y after randomization. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to evaluate the difference in mean serum concentrations and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate survival.\n\nResults: Data from all subjects was analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from a mean of 30.6 ± 3.2 ng/mL to 58.1 ± 3.5 ng/mL (p &amp;lt; 0.001) at one week and 36.7 ± 2.6 ng/mL by 12 weeks (p = 0.06) in the vitamin D group; in contrast, serum 25(OH)D concentrations remained unchanged in the placebo group. Unadjusted, one-year survival and hospital-free days were increased in the vitamin D group (p = 0.029, p = 0.036; respectively). There was also a trend toward increased IV antibiotic therapy-free days in the vitamin D group (p = 0.073). There were no signs of hypervitaminosis D or adverse events. Serum PTH and calcium concentrations were similar across both groups.\n\nConclusions: In this pilot study, a single, oral bolus of cholecalciferol increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations and was associated with a trend toward improved clinical outcomes in CF subjects hospitalized for a pulmonary exacerbation. Further investigation is needed into the clinical impact of improved vitamin D status in patients with CF.\n`

!!!!Pilot study of vitamin D supplementation in adults with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation: A randomized, controlled trial
[https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=2930|Dermato-Endocrinology Volume 4, Issue 2 April/May/June 2012]
Authors: Ruth E. Grossmann, Susu M. Zughaier, Meena Kumari, Shabnam Seydafkan, Robert H. Lyles, Shuling Liu, Viranuj Sueblinvong, Michael S. Schechter, Arlene A. Stecenko, Thomas R. Ziegler and Vin Tangpricha 

Background: Vitamin D insufficiency is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and vitamin D repletion may have an important role in improving clinical outcomes in CF. This randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot study examined the feasibility and impact of a single, large dose of cholecalciferol on vitamin D status and clinical outcomes in subjects with CF.

Methods: Thirty adults with were randomized in a double-blinded, pilot study to receive 250,000 IU cholecalciferol or placebo within 48 h of hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), clinical outcomes and potential adverse events were assessed up to 1-y after randomization. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to evaluate the difference in mean serum concentrations and log-rank analyses were used to evaluate survival.

Results: Data from all subjects was analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased from a mean of 30.6 ± 3.2 ng/mL to 58.1 ± 3.5 ng/mL (p &amp;lt; 0.001) at one week and 36.7 ± 2.6 ng/mL by 12 weeks (p = 0.06) in the vitamin D group; in contrast, serum 25(OH)D concentrations remained unchanged in the placebo group. Unadjusted, one-year survival and hospital-free days were increased in the vitamin D group (p = 0.029, p = 0.036; respectively). There was also a trend toward increased IV antibiotic therapy-free days in the vitamin D group (p = 0.073). There were no signs of hypervitaminosis D or adverse events. Serum PTH and calcium concentrations were similar across both groups.

Conclusions: In this pilot study, a single, oral bolus of cholecalciferol increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations and was associated with a trend toward improved clinical outcomes in CF subjects hospitalized for a pulmonary exacerbation. Further investigation is needed into the clinical impact of improved vitamin D status in patients with CF.
!!Approx 4X less risk of death due to single dose of Vitamin D

__Example: Give 250,000 IU vitamin D every 2 months.__

__~~#090:Suspect that it will be difficult to get approval for a large CF RCT in the future.~~__

Experimental studies suggest that vitamin D modulates the activity of adipocytes. The authors examined baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in relation to prevalent and cumulative incident obesity in Norway. A cohort of 25,616 adults aged 19-55 years participated in both the second and third surveys of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 2 (1995-1997) and HUNT 3 (2006-2008)). Serum 25(OH)D levels measured at baseline and anthropometric measurements taken at both baseline and follow-up were available for a random sample of 2,460 subjects. Overall, 40% of the 2,460 subjects had a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L, and 37% had a level of 50.0-74.9 nmol/L. The prevalence and cumulative incidence of obesity, defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) ?30, were 12% and 15%, respectively. Lower serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a higher prevalence of obesity. 

In the 2,165 subjects with baseline BMI less than 30, a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L was associated with a significantly increased odds ratio for incident obesity during follow-up (adjusted odds ratio = __1.73__, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 2.41). 

When prevalent and incident obesity were classified according to waist circumference (?88 cm for women, ?102 cm for men), similar results were obtained. In addition to prevalent obesity, a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L was significantly associated with new-onset obesity in adults.

!Interferon-? and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D interact to modulate relapse risk in MS.
Neurology. 2012 Jul 17;79(3):254-60. Epub 2012 Jun 13.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether interferon-? (IFN-?) medication use is associated with vitamin D levels and whether the two interact in exerting effects on relapse risk.

METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 178 persons with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) living in southern Tasmania in 2002-2005, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured biannually, with assessment by questionnaire for relevant factors, including IFN-? treatment.

RESULTS: Subjects reporting IFN-? use had significantly higher mean 25(OH)D than persons who did not (p &amp;lt; 0.001). This was mediated by an interaction between personal sun exposure and IFN-?, with treated persons realizing nearly __three times 25(OH)D per hour of sun__ exposure of persons not on therapy. The association between 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D did not differ by IFN-? therapy (p = 0.82). 

25(OH)D was associated with a reduced relapse risk only among persons on IFN-? (p &amp;lt; 0.001). 

Importantly, IFN-? was only protective against relapse among persons with higher 25(OH)D (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.98]), while among 25(OH)D-insufficient persons, IFN-? increased relapse risk (HR 2.01 [95% CI 1.22-3.32]).

CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that IFN-? therapy is associated with greater production of vitamin D from sun exposure, suggesting part of the therapeutic effects of IFN-? on relapse in MS may be through modulation of vitamin D metabolism. These findings suggest persons being treated with IFN-? should have vitamin D status monitored and maintained in the sufficiency range. Classification of evidence: This study provided Class III evidence that IFN-? is associated with reduced risk of relapse, and this effect may be modified by a positive effect of IFN-? on serum 25(OH)D levels.

!!!Vitamin D Nutritional Status and Antenatal Depressive Symptoms in African American Women
Journal of Women&amp;#39;s Health. Online Ahead of Print: July 23, 2012

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with depression; however, no studies have examined the relationship of vitamin D and antenatal depression. Antenatal depression increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes and poorer postpartum maternal and infant health. African American women are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and antenatal depression. Thus, we examined if early pregnancy vitamin D nutrition (VDN) was associated with antenatal depressive symptoms among African American women in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Methods: Women (n=178) were recruited from obstetrics clinics of a large health system. VDN was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). 
Depression symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale; 
CES-D?16 equates with criteria for __clinical depression__. 
Logistic regression was used to examine the association of log-transformed 25-OHD and elevated depression symptoms (CES-D?16).

Results: Mean 25-OHD was 13.4±8.4?ng/mL; most women (82.6%, n=147) were vitamin D inadequate or deficient (25-OHD&amp;lt;20?ng/mL). 
Mean CES-D was 15.2±10.7, and 74 (41.6%) women had a CES-D?16, suggestive of clinical depression.
A significant inverse relationship was found between log (25-OHD) and CES-D?16 (odds ratio __[OR] 0.54__, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.99, p=0.046). 

__For every 1-unit increase in log (25-OHD) (corresponding to 2.72?ng/mL increase in 25-OHD), the odds of CES-D?16 decreased by 46%.__

Conclusions: African American women with lower VDN exhibit increased depressive symptoms. 
Research on vitamin D supplementation for reducing antenatal depressive symptoms is needed.

They also provide dioxin and polychlorinated dioxin-like compounds (dl-compounds), which may interfere with vitamin D homeostasis. We investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) might be compromised by concomitant intake of dl-compounds.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 182 adults participating in the Norwegian Fish and Game Study. Participants who consumed fish liver and/or seagull eggs had higher dl-compound intake and blood concentrations than non-consumers (p &amp;lt; 0.001). \n\nVitamin D intake was higher (p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas serum 25(OH)D was lower (p = 0.029) in consumers than in non-consumers. \n\nAmong non-consumers, vitamin D intake was associated with serum 25(OH)D (?=1.06; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.63).

The association between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D did not seem to be compromised by intake of dl-compounds.\n\nCONCLUSION: To secure adequate vitamin D status while keeping the intake of dioxins and dl-polychlorinated biphenyls low, a healthy diet should include both supplemental vitamin D and oily fish. \n`

!!!!Fish liver and seagull eggs, vitamin D-rich foods with a shadow: results from the Norwegian Fish and Game Study.

SCOPE: Fish liver, fish liver oil, oily fish and seagull eggs have been major sources of vitamin D for the coastal population of Norway. They also provide dioxin and polychlorinated dioxin-like compounds (dl-compounds), which may interfere with vitamin D homeostasis. We investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) might be compromised by concomitant intake of dl-compounds.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 182 adults participating in the Norwegian Fish and Game Study. Participants who consumed fish liver and/or seagull eggs had higher dl-compound intake and blood concentrations than non-consumers (p &amp;lt; 0.001). 

Vitamin D intake was higher (p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas serum 25(OH)D was lower (p = 0.029) in consumers than in non-consumers. 

Among non-consumers, vitamin D intake was associated with serum 25(OH)D (?=1.06; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.63). This association was weaker among consumers (? = 0.52; 95% CI: -0.05, 1.08), but strengthened when adjusted for retinol intake (? = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.12, 1.21). The association between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D did not seem to be compromised by intake of dl-compounds.

CONCLUSION: To secure adequate vitamin D status while keeping the intake of dioxins and dl-polychlorinated biphenyls low, a healthy diet should include both supplemental vitamin D and oily fish. 
__Despite high nutrient content, dietary fish liver and seagull eggs should be restricted, due to dl-compounds and possible vitamin A-D antagonism.__

!!!! £ 5,000 funding for nursery staff who run Vitamin D projects: Date of article: 25-Jul-12
[http://www.daynurseries.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1557577/5000-pounds-funding-for-nursery-staff-who-run-vitamin-d-projects|Article by: Sue Learner, News Editor]

Nursery staff who run projects that support vitamin supplements and the promotion of vitamin D intake in children under five, could be eligible for £5,000 grants.

The Feeding for Life Foundation (FfLF) has launched a Promoting Best Practice Grant Scheme to provide a total of £20,000 worth of funding for grass roots projects.

The issue of vitamin D deficiency has been placed back on the public health agenda as a result of the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), which found toddlers are only achieving an average of 27 per cent of the recommended dietary intake of vitamin D from food sources.

The recent FfLF &amp;#39;Mind the Gap&amp;#39; report found 51 per cent of health care professionals and 74 per cent of parents surveyed were unaware of the Department of Health recommendations that all pregnant and breastfeeding women and children aged six months to five years should take a vitamin D supplement.

In response to the growing concern over poor vitamin D intake, the UK’s chief medical officers wrote to health care professionals to remind them of the importance of vitamin D supplementation and to highlight the groups most at risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Pinki Sahota, professor of nutrition and obesity at Leeds Metropolitan University and chair of the FfLF, said: &amp;quot;The issue of vitamin D deficiency is becoming an increasing problem in the UK.

&amp;quot;This scheme aims to help health care professionals and early years professionals tackle this issue and share best practice, by funding initiatives that raise awareness of the importance of vitamin D supplementation amongst parents of young children.&amp;quot;

You can find out further information on the Promoting Best Practice Grant Scheme on the Feeding for Life Foundation website.

Closing dates for 2012 applications are Friday 14th September and Monday 31st December.

&lt;p>In this issue of Journal of Clinical Oncology, Crew et al 1 report results of an examination of vitamin D in 103 premenopausal breast cancer patients who participated in a 1-year trial of zoledronate compared with placebo, in which all women received daily vitamin D (400 IU) and calcium (1,000 mg). Seventy-four percent of women were vitamin D deficient at study entry shortly after diagnosis; deficiency was more common in black and Hispanic women than in white women. After 1 year, less than 15% of the white women (but no Hispanic or black women) who had been vitamin D deficient at baseline achieved sufficient levels in their blood. The authors conclude, “…our study suggests that a dose of 400 IU daily is inadequate in breast cancer patients even to maintain skeletal health, and is probably too low for meaningful anticancer effects.” They go on to comment that controversy exists as to the upper safe daily limit of vitamin D supplementation and suggest “…it may be prudent to follow serum levels of 25-OHD &lt;span>[25-hydroxyvitamin D]&lt;/span>…” This carefully conducted study echoes results recently reported by Neuhouser et al 2 (that approximately three fourths of patients with breast cancer from Los Angeles had inadequate blood levels of vitamin D) and by our group3 (that the same proportion of patients with breast cancer in Toronto had inadequate levels).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>98 percent of black women had less than 20 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/98-percent-of-black-women-had-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/98-percent-of-black-women-had-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="determination-of-vitamin-d-in-relation-to-body-mass-index-and-race-in-a-defined-population-of-black-and-white-women">Determination of vitamin D in relation to body mass index and race in a defined population of black and white women.&lt;/h1>

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension. Vitamin D deficiency activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which affects the cardiovascular system. For this reason, it could be suggested that there is a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and atrial fibrillation (AF). In our study, we compared 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels between nonvalvular AF, valvular AF, and control groups in sinus rhythm. 

Method: A total of 102 patients with nonvalvular chronic AF without any other cardiovascular disease (mean age 62.51 ± 5.88; group I) and 96 patients with AF, which is associated with mitral valve disease (mean age 61.51 ± 5; group II) were included in our study. Of all, 100 age-matched healthy people with sinus rhythm were accepted as control groups (mean age 61.35 ± 5.44). Routine biochemical parameters, 25-OHD and parathormone levels were performed. 

Results: Baseline characteristics of the study groups were comparable. Group I patients had a lower vitamin D level than group II and the control group (6.51 ± 4.89, 9.24 ± 7.39, and 11.18 ± 6.98 ng/mL, P &amp;lt; .001, respectively). In groups I and II, the patients’ left atrium diameter and systolic pulmonary artery pressure are higher than the control group. 

Conclusion: As a result, our study revealed a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and nonvalvular AF.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in whether vitamin D inhibits breast cancer development. Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D promotes cell differentiation and retards or terminates proliferation of breast cancer cells. However, there is little evidence supporting the association of vitamin D and prognosis of breast cancer.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this analytic-descriptive study, 119 female patients with histological proven breast cancer were recruited in Tabriz oncology clinics in a 15-month period of time. History of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or receiving vitamin D/Ca supplements and presence of other malignancies were exclusion criteria. Serum level of 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured in all patients.

RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen patients with a mean age of 50.4?12.6 (26-76) years were enrolled in the study. Metastasis was present in 21.8% of the cases. 

Stage of tumor was I, II, III and IV in 11, 56, 26 and 26 patients, respectively. 

The Tumor grade was low in 37 cases, intermediate in 46 cases, and high in 36 cases. 

The P53, Ki-67, HER2, ER and PR were positive in 30.3%, 49.6%, 17.6%, 61.2% and 55.5% of the patients, respectively. 

The mean serum level of 25(OH)D was 15.7?17.8 (4-122) ng/ml, deficient in 66 cases, insufficient in 36 cases and normal level in 17 cases. 

The median level of 25(OH)D was lower in the P53+ group in a borderline trend (17.3 vs. 13.6 ng/ml; p=0.07). 

__The median level of 25(OH)D was significantly higher in the patients with metastasis, as well (27.7 vs. 12.0 ng/ml; p=0.03). __

There was no significant association between the serum level of 25(OH)D and other studied parameters.

CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, there may be an association between the serum level of 25(OH)D and prognosis of breast cancer.

!Vitamin D metabolism, sex hormones, and male reproductive function
Reproduction August 1, 2012 144 135-152

The spectrum of vitamin D (VD)-mediated effects has expanded in recent years, and VD is now recognized as a versatile signaling molecule rather than being solely a regulator of bone health and calcium homeostasis. One of the recently identified target areas of VD is male reproductive function. The VD receptor (VDR) and the VD metabolizing enzyme expression studies documented the presence of this system in the testes, mature spermatozoa, and ejaculatory tract, suggesting that both systemic and local VD metabolism may influence male reproductive function. However, it is still debated which cell is the main VD target in the testis and to what extent VD is important for sex hormone production and function of spermatozoa. 

This review summarizes descriptive studies on testicular VD metabolism and spatial distribution of VDR and the VD metabolizing enzymes in the mammalian testes and discusses mechanistic and association studies conducted in animals and humans. The reviewed evidence suggests some effects of VD on estrogen and testosterone biosynthesis and implicates involvement of both systemic and local VD metabolism in the regulation of male fertility potential.

&lt;p>We evaluated the prevalence of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> deficiency and the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected patients in the South-Central United States. The study consisted of a cross-sectional assessment of vitamin D levels in HIV-infected patients receiving routine clinical care from a private practice in Houston, Texas (latitude 29°N). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 20?ng/ml (&amp;lt;50?nmol/liter). Two-hundred enrolled patients were surveyed with a vitamin D questionnaire to determine daily supplemental vitamin D intake, dietary vitamin D intake, and average sunlight exposure (minutes/day). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Median 25(OH)D was 15.5?ng/ml (interquartile range 10.9-24.6) for the total population (n=200).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bone health markers generally not improved by 550 IU of vitamin D after birth</title><link>/posts/bone-health-markers-generally-not-improved-by-550-iu-of-vitamin-d-after-birth.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/bone-health-markers-generally-not-improved-by-550-iu-of-vitamin-d-after-birth.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="impact-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-on-markers-of-bone-mineral-metabolism-in-term-infants">Impact of vitamin D supplementation on markers of bone mineral metabolism in term infants.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) may influence bone turnover. We compared the dynamics of bone markers in 30 infants on vitamin D supplementation (?550IU/d) with different degrees of hypovitaminosis D (25OHD &amp;lt;11ng/ml - deficiency vs. ?11&amp;lt;20ng/ml - insufficiency). Baseline and follow-up (after 10 weeks), 25OHD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), PTH, osteocalcin (OC), N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), amino-terminal propeptide of C-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proCNP) were measured.

Accepted March 19, 2012.\n\nBackground Hypovitaminosis D is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). \nEffects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D replenishment in CKD are not well described.\n\nMethods An 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel intervention study was conducted in haemodialysis (HD) and non-HD CKD patients. Treatment consisted of 40 000 IU of cholecalciferol orally per week. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-diOHD), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum phosphate, ionized serum calcium and serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) were analysed. We also investigated biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (plasma D-dimer, plasma fibrinogen, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, plasma interleukin 6, plasma C-reactive protein, blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, aortic pulse wave velocity and 24-h urinary protein loss). Objective and subjective health variables were assessed (muscle function tests, visual analogue scores and Health Assessment Questionnaire).\n\nResults Fifty-two CKD patients with 25-OHD &amp;lt;50 nmol/L at screening were included. Cholecalciferol supplementation led to a significant increase to a median of 155 nmol/L 25-OHD (interquartile range 137–173 nmol/L) in treated patients (n = 25, P &amp;lt; 0.001). \n\nIn non-HD patients, we saw a significant increase in 1,25-diOHD (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and a lowering of PTH (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.001). \n\nThis was not observed in HD patients. Cholecalciferol supplementation caused a significant increase in serum calcium and FGF-23.\n\nConclusions 25-OHD replenishment was effectively obtained with the employed cholecalciferol dosing. In non-HD patients, it had favourable effects on 1,25-diOHD and PTH. Vitamin D-supplemented patients must be monitored for hypercalcaemia. \n\nThe present study could not identify significant pleiotropic effects of 25-OHD replenishment.\n\n`

Background Hypovitaminosis D is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D replenishment in CKD are not well described.

Methods An 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel intervention study was conducted in haemodialysis (HD) and non-HD CKD patients. Treatment consisted of 40 000 IU of cholecalciferol orally per week. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-diOHD), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum phosphate, ionized serum calcium and serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) were analysed. We also investigated biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (plasma D-dimer, plasma fibrinogen, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, plasma interleukin 6, plasma C-reactive protein, blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, aortic pulse wave velocity and 24-h urinary protein loss). Objective and subjective health variables were assessed (muscle function tests, visual analogue scores and Health Assessment Questionnaire).

Results Fifty-two CKD patients with 25-OHD &amp;lt;50 nmol/L at screening were included. Cholecalciferol supplementation led to a significant increase to a median of 155 nmol/L 25-OHD (interquartile range 137–173 nmol/L) in treated patients (n = 25, P &amp;lt; 0.001). 

In non-HD patients, we saw a significant increase in 1,25-diOHD (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and a lowering of PTH (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.001). 

This was not observed in HD patients. Cholecalciferol supplementation caused a significant increase in serum calcium and FGF-23.

Conclusions 25-OHD replenishment was effectively obtained with the employed cholecalciferol dosing. In non-HD patients, it had favourable effects on 1,25-diOHD and PTH. Vitamin D-supplemented patients must be monitored for hypercalcaemia. 

The present study could not identify significant pleiotropic effects of 25-OHD replenishment.

!!Summary by author for VitaminDWiki
*40,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for just 8 weeks to 25 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D levels below 20 nanograms/mL) , placebo to 24 matched controls 
*Active treatment corrected hypovitaminosis in all patients with final average vitamin D levels of 62 nanograms/mL versus 9 nanograms/mL in the placebo group. 
+Note: Vitamin D levels would probably have been much higher if the trial had lasted longer 
+Vitamin D half-life is 4-8 weeks.
*Beneficial effects on bone metabolism were seen in the subgroup of patients who were NOT undergoing dialysis, but not in patients undergoing dialysis

+It is amazing that such excellent results were buried in the paper. They were not in the title nor abstract.
+This is the result of about 10 trials with about 5,000 kidney disease patients.
+Note: some of the trials were terminated as they felt it was __~~#30F:morally wrong to not give vitamin D to all of the Kidney patients~~__

!The relationship between vitamin d and severe early childhood caries: a pilot study.
Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2012 Jan;82(1):53-62.
Schroth R, Jeal N, Kliewer E, Sellers E.
University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and Manitoba Institute of Child Health, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Introduction: Children with Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC) routinely require dental surgery. S-ECC is known to affect childhood health and well-being. The objective of this pilot study was to assess vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and determine whether differences exist between children with and without S-ECC. 

Methods: During July-September 2008, children undergoing surgery for S-ECC &amp;lt; 72 months of age from southern Manitoba were recruited. Age-matched controls were caries-free. Parents completed an interviewed questionnaire. A serum sample was obtained for 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This study was approved by the University of Manitoba?s Ethics Board. Statistics included chi-square analysis, t-tests, and multiple and logistic regression. A p value of &amp;lt;= 0.05 was significant. 

Results: Thirty-eight children participated (50 % with S-ECC). There was no significant age difference between groups (p = 0.82). 

The majority of the entire sample (84.2 %) had inadequate vitamin D levels. 

Children with S-ECC had lower concentrations of 25(OH)D (52.9 ± 15.1 nmol/L vs. 64.4 ± 21.3, p = 0.032) and were at __twice the odds of having inadequate levels (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L)__. Children with S-ECC also had significantly higher PTH levels than caries-free children (53.5 ± 17.6 cm/L vs. 33.9 ± 12.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001). A greater number with S-ECC had elevated PTH levels (68.4 % vs. 21.1 %, p &amp;lt; 0.01). 

Conclusions: This pilot study is the first to report differences in 25(OH)D between those with S-ECC and cavity-free controls. Children with S-ECC have lower vitamin D levels and increased PTH levels compared to age-matched controls.

!!!Comment by VitaminDWiki
Vitamin D [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1270|Cofactors] such as Calcium, Magnesium, and Vitamin K2, are also very important in making bone and teeth.
Also helpful are elements which are non cofactors, such as Boron, Silicon, and Strontium

This review summarizes evidence from studies that evaluated thresholds for serum 25(OH)D concentrations in relation to bone mineral density (BMD), lower-extremity function, dental health, and risk of falls, fractures, and colorectal cancer. For all endpoints, the most advantageous serum concentrations of 25(OH)D begin at 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), and the best are between 90 and 100 nmol/L (36-40 ng/mL). In most persons, these concentrations could not be reached with the currently recommended intakes of 200 and 600 IU vitamin D/d for younger and older adults, respectively. A comparison of vitamin D intakes with achieved serum concentrations of 25(OH)D for the purpose of estimating optimal intakes led us to suggest that, for bone health in younger adults and all studied outcomes in older adults, an increase in the currently recommended intake of vitamin D is warranted. An intake for all adults of &amp;gt; or =1000 IU (25 microg) &lt;span>[DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED]&lt;/span> vitamin D (cholecalciferol)/d is needed to bring vitamin D concentrations in no less than 50% of the population up to 75 nmol/L. The implications of higher doses for the entire adult population should be addressed in future studies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D not associated with PAD after adjusting for race, diabetes and BMI</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-not-associated-with-pad-after-adjusting-for-race-diabetes-and-bmi.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-not-associated-with-pad-after-adjusting-for-race-diabetes-and-bmi.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-status-and-functional-performance-in-peripheral-artery-disease">Vitamin D status and functional performance in peripheral artery disease&lt;/h2>

!!Why Vitamin D?
I used to think of Vitamin D as one of those things that was obviously good for me, but not something I had to think about too deeply. I never purposely avoided it, but I didn’t go out of my way to consume it either. I thought if I just drank my milk and got a bit of sun each day, then I was providing my body with enough Vitamin D. wellbeing 

Turns out, I was kind of right. For the 18 year old me.

Background: High vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of relapses and disease progression in multiple sclerosis.

Methods: This 96-week randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone mineral density in persons with multiple sclerosis. Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly raised median serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) to 121 nmol/L. The modified intention to treat analysis included 35 persons in the vitamin D3 group and 33 in the placebo group. Participants were age 21 to 50 years and fully ambulatory (median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 2.5). We studied the effect of supplementing vitamin D3 on the exploratory outcomes annualised relapse rate (ARR), EDSS, multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC) components, grip strength, and fatigue.

Results: After 96 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in ARR (absolute difference 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; p = 0.25), EDSS (absolute difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.35; p = 0.97), MSFC components, grip strength, or fatigue.

Conclusion: Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly did not result in beneficial effects on the measured multiple sclerosis-related outcomes. This study was not powered to address clinical outcomes, but none of the results were suggestive of an effect in this unselected population of fully ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis.

&lt;p>In Jan 2012 I became aware of a &lt;strong>pill&lt;/strong> which provides some protection of damage of the skin from the sun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pill contains natural &lt;strong>antioxidents&lt;/strong> which reduce skin damage for both UVA and UVB rays WITHOUT decreasing the amount of UVB (read that as Vitamin D) that the skin receives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blackouts due to low blood pressure associated with 8 nanograms lower vitamin D</title><link>/posts/blackouts-due-to-low-blood-pressure-associated-with-8-nanograms-lower-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/blackouts-due-to-low-blood-pressure-associated-with-8-nanograms-lower-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-orthostatic-hypotension">Vitamin D and orthostatic hypotension&lt;/h3>

Aims To compare depressive symptoms in participants with low and high serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and to examine whether supplementation with vitamin D3 would improve symptoms in those with low serum 25(OH)D levels.

Method Participants with low 25(OH)D levels were randomised to either placebo or 40 000 IU vitamin D3 per week for 6 months. Individuals with high serum 25(OH)D levels were used as nested controls. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Seasonal Pattern Assessment Scale and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ([http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00960232|NCT00960232]).

Results Participants with low 25(OH)D levels (n = 230) at baseline were more depressed (P&amp;lt;0.05) than participants with high 25(OH)D levels (n = 114). 
In the intervention study no significant effect of high-dose vitamin D was found on depressive symptom scores when compared with placebo.

Conclusions Low levels of serum 25(OH)D are associated with depressive symptoms, but no effect was found with vitamin D supplementation.

Here we compare weighted UV irradiances relevant to erythema (sunburn) and vitamin-D production from 2 phototherapy units and 2 commercial solaria with those under clear-skies in summer and winter at Lauder New Zealand (45°S). We find that weighted irradiances from one solarium are an order-of-magnitude greater than for summer sunlight whereas the others are comparable with summer sunlight, and an order-of-magnitude greater than winter sunlight. For most solaria, UV-A irradiances far exceed those in sunlight, constituting a potentially serious health risk. The calculated vitamin D benefit to erythema risk ratios for the solaria are comparable to, or greater than for with summer sunlight, and significantly greater for one of the phototherapy booths (the predominantly UV-B booth). Exposure times to maintain sufficient vitamin-D without inducing erythema are extremely short for the latter solarium, whereas for the others they are comparable to, or less than, those for summer sunlight. For winter sunlight, deduced exposure times for vitamin-D sufficiency are impractically long. In conclusion, the solaria tested should be capable of helping to maintain vitamin-D sufficiency. However there is an attendant risk of erythema; and exposure times are sensitive to the choice of action spectrum. For all solaria the spectrum differs greatly from sunlight with unnaturally high irradiances at some wavelengths, which could have adverse health effects.

Both are strongly peaked in the UV-B region, but while the production of vitamin D is confined to UV-B wavelengths, the induction of erythema extends to longer UV-A wavelengths. The figure also shows the ratio of these two weighting functions (RDE(1)). For wavelengths less than 298 nm, RDE is close to unity. It increases towards longer wavelengths reaching a peak value of 3.5 near 308 nm, and then decreases to zero by 330 nm. Thus the optimal wavelength range for vitamin D synthesis without inducing erythema is between 305 and 312 nm. The overall weighted irradiances are calculated by integrating the spectral irradiance weighted by the action spectra.\n`

In solaria the radiation field is approximately isotropic, but in sunlight it is not. For example, when the SZA is small (e.g., at noon in summer) the UV dose received by a person standing vertically is less than for a person lying horizontally.

As shown by Figure 3, future revisions in the action spectrum for production of pre-vitamin could affect the inferred benefits. These ratios are also influenced significantly by the factor 0.35 used for summer sun. For cloudy skies, or for horizontal orientation, the benefits from summer sunlight could be significantly larger, making the ratios for other sources smaller. For single-sided sunbeds the benefits would be halved.\n\nRecently it was argued that differences in spectral output between the artificial source used in Holick&amp;#39;s study(2002) and sunlight were not properly taken into account, and that the exposure periods necessary in summer sunlight may be significantly less than noted above (Dowdy et al. 2010). Further, when estimating absolute exposure times, possible non-linearity in UV dose versus response in pre-vitamin D must be considered. Because the products of 7-DHC photolysis absorb UV-B, there is a threshold above which continued irradiation is less effective in producing pre vitamin D (Holick et al. 1981). Early work showed that non-linearities become important for exposures longer than 15 to 30 minutes to summer sunlight (MacLaughlin et al. 1982), which corresponds to a threshold typically greater than 1 MED. More recently it was found that the production of in-vitro cholecalciferol from 4 MED was only 50% more than that from 2 MED (Olds et al. 2008). Subsequent work found that the change in vitamin D remained linear up to 1 MED in sunlight (Olds 2010). The studies used to derive the dose-responses used here were from simulated sunlight for an exposure of 1 MED (Holick 2004b). Any departures from linearity would lead to over-estimates of the exposure times for smaller doses. There are several other significant contributions to the error budget in the derived exposure times. These include uncertainties in spectral measurements, non-uniformities of the radiation fields, and geometric considerations. We estimate the overall uncertainty in the derived exposure times to be ±50%. That uncertainty applies only to skin for which 1 MED = 2.5 SED. In practice, even for the same skin sensitivities there will be further variations in response as a function of other factors such as age and obesity (Holick 2004a). The exposure times also scale with MED and the UV sun blocking factor (SPF) of any sunscreens used; and skin sensitivity is likely to change with acclimation to UV exposure due to skin-thickening and the build-up of melanin.\n`

One possible benefit is to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D in the winter months when natural levels of UV relevant for its production are less than 10% of those in summer. However, caution is advised. The use of these solaria poses unknown health risks for the unnaturally high irradiances at some wavelengths in both the UV-B and UV-A regions. For both of the sunbeds tested and one phototherapy booth, the integrated UV-A irradiances far exceed those ever experienced in sunlight.\n\nBiologically weighted irradiances from three UV-A solaria tested are comparable with summer sunlight, while that from the UV-B solarium was about a factor of 10 greater. After corrections are applied to account for the geometric differences inherent in each source, the benefit/risk ratios for vitamin D production compared with erythema are comparable to, or slightly larger than, summer sunlight for the two sunbeds and for the UV-A phototherapy booth; but are significantly greater for the UV-B phototherapy booth.\n\nGiven evidence of association with increased melanoma risk (Cust et al. 2011), poor adherence to protective standards in an unregulated commercial environment (Paul et al. 2005) and the possibility of other unquantified risk factors that may arise from the unnaturally high irradiances that occur at some wavelengths from these sunbeds, their use cannot be advocated as a means of ensuring vitamin D sufficiency. More effective methods, which come at much lower financial costs and health risk, include prudent exposure to natural sunlight in summer, with possible dietary supplementation in the winter.

!!Comments on chart by VitaminDWiki
*Blue area is &amp;lt; 1,000 IU per day from UVB with full body exposure 
+many organizations have found that adults need at least 2,000 IU daily
+Also, need much longer time if not getting daily UV. 
+Example: if get UV only twice per week then will need 7/2 = 3.5X longer time
*Booth B - phototherapy booth with UV__B__ has 20 tubes
*Booth A - phototherapy booth with UV__A__ has 36 tubes
*Beds are tanning beds
*Erythema = slight pinking of the skin the next day, which is a very mild sunburn, not skin cancer
*Assumes: person is lying down (this incorporates 35% more time in the winter to compensate for sun angle)
+Need more time if standing up (not perpendicular to the rays of the sun)
*Assumes: Skin type II (darker skin need 4X to 10X longer times), 
*Assumes: Youth (Skin over age 70 appears to need 3X longer times)
*Assumes: Not obese (obese people need 2X to 3X as much to get the same response from XXX IU)
*Assumes: Standard level of cholesterol
*Assumes: Not use suncream (decrease) nor sun tan oil (increase)
*Assumes: That the person does not turn over in the middle of sessions in the sun
+which would decrease by half the amount of sun on any portion of skin ==&amp;gt; raise the pink line
*Assumes: increased UVB intensity is proportional to the amount of vitamin D generated

!!People evolved under the following conditions (which have changed a lot)
*People were outdoors everyday (so we could slowly adjust to the annual increase of UVB without sunburn)
*The bright sun was available throughout the year (this assumes during the last 20,000 years that most people lived within 30 degrees of the equator)
*That each person would not live very long (seniors get far less vitamin D from the sun than youth)
*That people were not obese (obese people need at least 2X more vitamin D, which is secreted away in their fat)
+If there was any weight gain, it happened near harvest time when there was lots of vitamin D and that added weight/vitamin D was gone before the next harvest
*People ate animals which lived out-of-doors, so there was lots of vitamin D in the meat, especially the organ meats
+Also, the animals generally ate green grass, etc. had lots of [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=765|vitamin K2], which is a vitamin D [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1270|cofactor]

Exposures to UV radiation from solaria and sunlight have potentially damaging and beneficial effects that are not yet fully quantified. Here we compare weighted UV irradiances relevant to erythema (sunburn) and vitamin-D production from 2 phototherapy units and 2 commercial solaria with those under clear-skies in summer and winter at Lauder New Zealand (45°S). We find that weighted irradiances from one solarium are an order-of-magnitude greater than for summer sunlight whereas the others are comparable with summer sunlight, and an order-of-magnitude greater than winter sunlight. For most solaria, UV-A irradiances far exceed those in sunlight, constituting a potentially serious health risk. The calculated vitamin D benefit to erythema risk ratios for the solaria are comparable to, or greater than for with summer sunlight, and significantly greater for one of the phototherapy booths (the predominantly UV-B booth). Exposure times to maintain sufficient vitamin-D without inducing erythema are extremely short for the latter solarium, whereas for the others they are comparable to, or less than, those for summer sunlight. For winter sunlight, deduced exposure times for vitamin-D sufficiency are impractically long. In conclusion, the solaria tested should be capable of helping to maintain vitamin-D sufficiency. However there is an attendant risk of erythema; and exposure times are sensitive to the choice of action spectrum. For all solaria the spectrum differs greatly from sunlight with unnaturally high irradiances at some wavelengths, which could have adverse health effects. Their use is not advocated as a way of ensuring vitamin-D sufficiency.

!Introduction
The health risks from excessive exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation are well documented, and include an increased incidences of sunburn and skin cancer (Lucas 2010, Norval et al. 2011). However, despite these risks, there has been increased interest in intentional exposure to UV for cosmetic uses such as inducing a tan, or for possible health benefits such as increased vitamin D status, particularly in view of the multiple roles that vitamin D may play in maintaining human health, including protection against rickets, and possible protection against some forms of cancer (e.g., colon cancer) (Chu et al. 2010, Holick 2007). Dietary intake of vitamin D is generally small in populations such as New Zealand&amp;#39;s where there is little food fortification. The main source of vitamin D is initiated by photo conversion of 7 dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)a in the skin to form pre-vitamin D, which is subsequently converted to vitamin D, then serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] (Holick 2007).

The relatively high UV irradiances in the New Zealand summer, combined with the relatively light skin colouring of a significant proportion of the population and outdoor lifestyle are all contributing factors to New Zealand, along with Australia, having the highest rate of melanoma skin cancer in the world (Brougham et al. 2010). However, in the New Zealand winter, peak UVI values are only 5 to 10% of those in summer, and this low winter UV is a contributing factor to sub-optimal vitamin D status, especially in the winter and spring months (Chatfield et al. 2007, Rockell et al. 2006).
Here we compare UV irradiances from four solaria, typical of what is found in New Zealand, with solar noon clear-sky irradiances from sunlight measured at Lauder New Zealand (45°S) close to the summer and winter solstices.

!!2. Methods
!!!2.1 Scope of Study
We compare the outputs of the various sources of UV radiation in terms of their spectral irradiances, and their unweighted UV-B and UV-A outputs. Differences in these may lead to health issues in their own right. There is a wide range in possible benefits and risks of UV exposure, but the physiological effects discussed here are limited to the capacity of the sources to induce erythema (sunburn), or to initiate the production of vitamin D. Erythema from sun exposure is a clear indicator of excessive UV, and the association between sunburn history and skin cancer (Gandini et al. 2005) is the basis of sun-advisory messages such as &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let your kids get burnt&amp;quot; which are promoted by health agencies such as the Cancer Societies in New Zealand and Australia. We emphasise that other positive and negative health outcomes from UV exposures, with wavelength dependencies, may also be important.

!!!2.2 Weighting Functions
The relative importance of different wavelengths (l) in inducing biological effects is described by the &amp;quot;action spectrum&amp;quot;. Figure 1 compares the action spectra for erythema(McKinlay &amp;amp; Diffey 1987, Webb et al. 2011) and for the production of pre-vitamin D from 7-DHC in the skin (Bouillon et al. 2006, MacLaughlin et al. 1982). Both are strongly peaked in the UV-B region, but while the production of vitamin D is confined to UV-B wavelengths, the induction of erythema extends to longer UV-A wavelengths. The figure also shows the ratio of these two weighting functions (RDE(1)). For wavelengths less than 298 nm, RDE is close to unity. It increases towards longer wavelengths reaching a peak value of 3.5 near 308 nm, and then decreases to zero by 330 nm. Thus the optimal wavelength range for vitamin D synthesis without inducing erythema is between 305 and 312 nm. The overall weighted irradiances are calculated by integrating the spectral irradiance weighted by the action spectra.

!!!2.3 Solaria
The solaria evaluated in this study comprise two walk-in phototherapy booths used in an Auckland dermatological practice, and two commercial sunbeds which were until recently located at the Moana Pool recreational facility in Dunedin.

The two phototherapy booths are designated as Booth A and Booth B, depending in whether they primarily emit primarily UV-A or UV-B radiation. 
The UV-A chamber (model Daavlin Spectra 305/350) comprises 36 tubes of type &amp;quot;Philips F 72 T12 BL-HO&amp;quot;, 
and the UV-B chamber (model Daavlin Spectra 726-SP-2X) comprises 20 tubes of type &amp;quot;Philips TL 100W/01-FS72&amp;quot;. 
The booths are used for treatment of skin disorders.

Note that since both action spectra include an arbitrary normalisation neither they nor their ratios relate directly to specific physiological changes.

The two sunbeds, which are used for cosmetic purposes, are designated as Bed 1 and Bed 2. 
Users lying on these beds are irradiated from above and below.
Both beds emit primarily UV-A radiation. 
Bed 1 is Hapro Luxura model, with 26 &amp;quot;Hapro 100 W R&amp;quot; tubes and a face tube. 
Bed 2 is an older unlabelled sun bed fitted with 24 newly-purchased &amp;quot;100W Cosmedico brilliant&amp;quot; tubes and a face tube. 
The fluorescent tubes used in the sunbeds are typical for solaria in common use in New Zealand. 
The irradiances measured here are comparable with those measured from sunbeds in Australia (Gies et al. 2011) and elsewhere(Nilsen et al. 2011). 
These latter studies show that there is a wide variability in output between beds. 
The outputs can also vary substantially over time as the fluorescent tubes age.

!!!2.4 Spectral measurements
Spectral irradiances from the solaria and from sunlight were determined using calibration procedures that are traceable to the USA&amp;#39;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The uncertainty in solar spectral irradiances is ±5%. Spectra from the solaria were measured with a diode array spectrograph which was cross calibrated against the spectroradiometer. There is considerable spatial variability within the solaria, and we use the means of at least 20 spectra taken from different sites and directions in the chambers. Although the overall spatial variability is large (~20%), the uncertainties in differences between solaria will be smaller because geometric effects are common to all. Further details of the measurement method and the stability of the booths will be described elsewhere.

!!!2.5 Geometric corrections
In the solaria, the irradiance measurements apply to all surface orientations, whereas in sunlight they apply to the upper horizontal surface only. Surfaces oriented towards the sun receive higher irradiances, while those oriented away from the sun receive lower irradiances. In downwelling radiation, these directional effects are large for visible radiation, but less important for UV-B radiation for which at least half of the total is from diffuse skylight, with the fraction from direct sunlight decreasing rapidly as the solar zenith angle (SZA) increases. For example, in the winter spectrum, when the noon SZA is 67°, the direct beam component of UV-B is less than 15% of the total (Zeng et al. 1994). Consequently, the downwelling UV-B radiation is much more isotropic than visible radiation. On the other hand, the upwelling component reflected from the surface is much smaller for UV-B radiation than for visible radiation because of the much lower reflectivity (albedo) of most surfaces in the UV-B region. The overall effect of these factors depends on the SZA, the ozone amounts, and the orientation of surfaces.

For erythema, directional peak irradiances are more important than mean irradiances. In solaria, these peaks are typically 1.15±0.05 greater than the means due to tube-to-tube variability. In sunlight, the peak irradiances occur on surfaces oriented towards the sun, rather than on a horizontal surface. The geometric factors (fp) to convert to peak irradiances is close to unity for the summer spectrum when the sun is nearly directly overhead, but is __1.35 for the winter spectrum__ (McKenzie et al. 1997).

Conversely, for pre vitamin D production, mean values are more important than peak values because the production of vitamin D is proportional to the area of skin irradiated. In solaria the radiation field is approximately isotropic, but in sunlight it is not. For example, when the SZA is small (e.g., at noon in summer) the UV dose received by a person standing vertically is less than for a person lying horizontally. But when the SZA is large (e.g., in winter) the vertical orientation receives more than the horizontal orientation. Further, the total UV dose received depends on posture, with a probable minimum for the fetal position, and a maximum when limbs are widely splayed. To characterise these effects it would be preferable to measure omnidirectional fluxes (e.g., the actinic flux) rather than irradiances. However, even then it would be impractical to fully characterise these effects for all conditions. Here we use factors calculated for a cylindrical approximation to the human form (Pope and Godar, 2010). Using this approximation, the geometric correction factors (fm) to convert to mean irradiances over the skin area are 0.35 and 0.55 for summer and winter sunlight respectively, 0.9 for the horizontal sunbeds where lateral radiation is less intense, and 1.0 for the phototherapy booths.

There is a huge variability in these UVIb values, covering more than two orders-of-magnitude. __The UVI from Booth B is more than 10 times that for summer sunlight__, and for winter sunlight it is less than 10% of that for summer sunlight. The ratio of erythemally-weighted and pre-vitamin D irradiances (RDE = UVVitD/UVEry) also varies greatly between sources. The geometric factors (fp, and fm respectively) are applied to convert to peak values that are most relevant to erythema, and to mean skin-area weighted values that are most relevant to the production of pre-vitamin D.

!!3. Results 3.1 Irradiances
Figure 2 shows spectral irradiances from the two phototherapy booths and sunlight for clear skies at solar noon (about 12:45 NZST) near the summer and winter solstices at Lauder, Central Otago, New Zealand (45 °S, 170°E, alt 370 m). There are marked differences between all sources. The spectrum of Booth B is dominated by a strong emission at 311 nm. Spectra from the two commercial sunbeds are broadly similar to that for Booth A.

For the solaria, irradiances at some wavelengths within the UV region far exceed those from summer sunlight. Compared with erythema, the weighted irradiances for vitamin D production tend to be larger in the UV-B region, but are smaller in the UV-A region, reducing to zero for wavelengths greater than 330 nm.

Weighted irradiances are shown in Table 1. For three solaria, the UV-B irradiances are similar to that from summer sunlight; but the UV-A irradiances far exceed those from sunlight, and may constitute an unknown health risk that is not quantified further here.

!!!3.2 Benefits for Vitamin D Production versus Risks of Erythema Induction
RDE in Table 1 provides an estimate of the benefit-to-risk ratio for each source, where the benefit is for the production of vitamin D, and the risk is against the induction of erythema. The values in Table 1 assume equal skin areas are exposed to the mean irradiances from each source. By this criterion the UV-A sources (i.e., Booth A, and the two sun-beds) are comparable with winter sunlight, while the ratio is twice as large for the UV-B source (Booth B ) and summer sunlight.

In Table 2 we show the geometrically-adjusted risks and benefits from each source relative to summer sunlight. For winter sunlight, both the risks and benefits are reduced by a factor of 10 compared with summer sunlight. For one of the UV-A beds (Bed 1) both the risks and benefits are less than for summer sunlight. For the other two UV-A solaria (Booth A and Bed 2) the risk is slightly greater than for summer sunlight, while the benefits are more than twice as great. For the UV-B booth (Booth B ), the risk is increased by more than a factor of ~15 compared with sunlight, while the benefit is increased a factor of ~45. The benefit/risk ratios for each source are comparable with summer sunlight, except for Booth B, which lower for winter sunlight and slightly larger is three times larger. The ratio is slightly lower for winter sunlight and slightly higher for the other three solaria

!!3.3 Estimated Range of Optimal Exposure Times
The ratios in Table 2 can be converted to approximate exposure times necessary for erythema and vitamin D sufficiency, using published values of the respective times from summer sunlight (McKenzie et al. 2009). These exposure times depend on skin type, and additionally the skin-area exposed for vitamin D sufficiency. The results are approximate, because in practice, the critical exposure times for both the end-points vary greatly between individuals, depending on their skin sensitivity and other factors in the case of vitamin D.

The maximum exposure time (Tmax) is that needed to induce erythema (sunburn). The recommended threshold exposure between Fitzpatrick&amp;#39;s skin type I and II is 2.5 SEDc (ANZS 2008, Fitzpatrick 1988) was used because individuals with skin type I are advised against using sunbeds. For the summer sunlight spectrum, the time taken to receive 2.5 SED is approximately 15 minutes.

The minimum exposure time (Tmin) is that needed to maintain blood serum vitamin D sufficiency. We adopt the criterion that vitamin D sufficiency is equivalent to a daily dietary intake of 1000 IUd (Vieth et al. 2007). It has been shown that 1 MED of full-body exposure to simulated sunlight is equivalent to 20,000 IU (Holick 2004b), so vitamin D sufficiency is achieved with a daily exposure of 6% of the body to 1 MED, or equivalently, an exposure of 25% of the body to 0.25 MED (Holick 2002), or a full-body exposure to 0.06 MED, which corresponds to about 1 minute per day of full body exposure to summer noon sunlight.
*c 1 SED = 1 Standard Erythemal Dose = 100 Jm-2 of erythemally-weighted irradiance. 
+d IU = International Unit, where 1000 IU corresponds to 25 mg of vitamin D. One teaspoon of cod-liver oil contains approximately 400 IU of vitamin D (Hollis 2005).
The resulting ranges of approximate exposure times are shown in Figure 3. The red shaded area represents exposure periods longer than those that would induce erythema in fair skins. The blue shaded area represents exposure periods shorter than those needed to maintain vitamin D sufficiency for daily full-body exposures. The unshaded area between these extremes represents the window of opportunity in exposure times for each source for optimal outcomes according to these two criteria.

To illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of action spectrum, the dashed blue lines show exposure times for vitamin D sufficiency as calculated from an alternative action spectrum measured at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), for the conversion from 7-DHC to pre-vitamin D (Olds 2010). If that spectrum were valid, then the time required to maintain vitamin D sufficiency would be shorter for the three UV-A solaria, but longer for the UV-B booth (Booth B ) and for winter sunlight.

For different skin types, the exposure times in Figure 3 should be scaled according to the number of SEDs per MED (Fitzpatrick 1988). This is valid for pre-vitamin D production as well as erythema because the wavelengths involved are similar in each case. For the most sensitive skin type (skin type I), the exposure times should be decreased, and for darkest skin types they should be increased by a factor of 10 or more (Holick 2004b). Similarly, the times should be scaled according the effective sun protection factor (SPF) of any sunscreens while recognising that, because of the application thickness is usually somewhat less that the application design criterion 2 mg/cm2 (Gies 2011), the effective SPF is usually less than the advertised value. The exposure times must also be increased markedly for exposures through glass windows, which in New Zealand sunlight typically transmit less than 10% of UVEry and less than 1% of UVVitD.
!!!Figure 3. 
Approximate exposure time in minutes for erythema and to maintain vitamin D sufficiency (equivalent to 1000IUper day) for full-body exposure.

If smaller skin areas are exposed as is likely in sunlight (especially in winter), then the exposure times for vitamin-D sufficiency will be longer. It may not be reasonable to simply assume that the times scale with body area. Firstly, different areas of the body have different levels of pigmentation. Further, the thickness of the skin and variations in the skin transmission as a function of wavelength may also be important. Nevertheless it is clear that if just the hands and face are exposed; representing ~10% of the total skin surface area, then the blue curves would shift up by approximately one order of magnitude. In that case, there would be only a very small window in time between receiving too little UV to maintain vitamin D sufficiency without erythema.

!4. Discussion
There has been discussion in the literature (Norval et al. 2009) about the validity of the action spectrum for pre vitamin D (Bouillon et al. 2006). For example, there is an inconsistency regarding summer/winter differences in vitamin D production (McKenzie et al. 2009 ). As shown by Figure 3, future revisions in the action spectrum for production of pre-vitamin could affect the inferred benefits. These ratios are also influenced significantly by the factor 0.35 used for summer sun. For cloudy skies, or for horizontal orientation, the benefits from summer sunlight could be significantly larger, making the ratios for other sources smaller. For single-sided sunbeds the benefits would be halved.

Recently it was argued that differences in spectral output between the artificial source used in Holick&amp;#39;s study(2002) and sunlight were not properly taken into account, and that the exposure periods necessary in summer sunlight may be significantly less than noted above (Dowdy et al. 2010). Further, when estimating absolute exposure times, possible non-linearity in UV dose versus response in pre-vitamin D must be considered. Because the products of 7-DHC photolysis absorb UV-B, there is a threshold above which continued irradiation is less effective in producing pre vitamin D (Holick et al. 1981). Early work showed that non-linearities become important for exposures longer than 15 to 30 minutes to summer sunlight (MacLaughlin et al. 1982), which corresponds to a threshold typically greater than 1 MED. More recently it was found that the production of in-vitro cholecalciferol from 4 MED was only 50% more than that from 2 MED (Olds et al. 2008). Subsequent work found that the change in vitamin D remained linear up to 1 MED in sunlight (Olds 2010). The studies used to derive the dose-responses used here were from simulated sunlight for an exposure of 1 MED (Holick 2004b). Any departures from linearity would lead to over-estimates of the exposure times for smaller doses. There are several other significant contributions to the error budget in the derived exposure times. These include uncertainties in spectral measurements, non-uniformities of the radiation fields, and geometric considerations. We estimate the overall uncertainty in the derived exposure times to be ±50%. That uncertainty applies only to skin for which 1 MED = 2.5 SED. In practice, even for the same skin sensitivities there will be further variations in response as a function of other factors such as age and obesity (Holick 2004a). The exposure times also scale with MED and the UV sun blocking factor (SPF) of any sunscreens used; and skin sensitivity is likely to change with acclimation to UV exposure due to skin-thickening and the build-up of melanin.

!5. Conclusions
Solaria in common use in New Zealand have potential benefits as well as their well-known risks. One possible benefit is to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D in the winter months when natural levels of UV relevant for its production are less than 10% of those in summer. However, caution is advised. The use of these solaria poses unknown health risks for the unnaturally high irradiances at some wavelengths in both the UV-B and UV-A regions. For both of the sunbeds tested and one phototherapy booth, the integrated UV-A irradiances far exceed those ever experienced in sunlight.

Biologically weighted irradiances from three UV-A solaria tested are comparable with summer sunlight, while that from the UV-B solarium was about a factor of 10 greater. After corrections are applied to account for the geometric differences inherent in each source, the benefit/risk ratios for vitamin D production compared with erythema are comparable to, or slightly larger than, summer sunlight for the two sunbeds and for the UV-A phototherapy booth; but are significantly greater for the UV-B phototherapy booth.

Given evidence of association with increased melanoma risk (Cust et al. 2011), poor adherence to protective standards in an unregulated commercial environment (Paul et al. 2005) and the possibility of other unquantified risk factors that may arise from the unnaturally high irradiances that occur at some wavelengths from these sunbeds, their use cannot be advocated as a means of ensuring vitamin D sufficiency. More effective methods, which come at much lower financial costs and health risk, include prudent exposure to natural sunlight in summer, with possible dietary supplementation in the winter. Fortification of foods can also contribute.

!Vitamin D, UV, and skin cancer in the elderly: to expose or not to expose?
Glossmann H.
Gerontology. 2011;57(4):350-3. Epub 2010 Dec 22.
Institute for Biochemical Pharmacology, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria. Hartmut.Glossmann@i-med.ac.at

There is mounting concern about vitamin D insufficiency, especially in the ageing population. Increases in indoor lifestyle, obesity, car travel, clothing habits, the use of photo-protective makeup, and campaigns driven by dermatologists, governments, and the cosmetic industry to avoid or protect against the sun as much as possible are contributing to this trend. 

In a recent article in Gerontology, Barysch et al. [1] recommend that the ageing population avoid any &amp;#39;intentional&amp;#39; UV radiation as well as &amp;#39;minimize sun exposure&amp;#39; based on known dangers of developing skin cancer. They warn that &amp;#39;studies with vitamin D supplements reported increased risks of prostate and esophagus cancer as well as atopy in childhood&amp;#39; and concluded that &amp;#39;adequate levels of vitamin D are essential for the elderly&amp;#39;, but do not suggest which level is optimal. I will argue that the ageing population should keep their serum 25-(OH)-vitamin D(3) (25-(OH)-D) levels in the 75-100 nmol/l range. An oral cholecalciferol intake of ?2,000 IU/day is recommended as a supplement throughout the year for those who cannot enjoy the sun in summer or only during &amp;#39;vitamin D winter&amp;#39; for the others.

!!Interesting statements in the paper
*Intense (with sunburns) and intermittent (vacation or weekend) UVR exposure, especially in early childhood, predispose to MM
*The MM risk of the trunk and limbs increases with a higher socioeconomic status (more recreational, intermittent sun exposure) but is surprisingly largely uninfluenced by latitude and ambient UV-B radiation [15]
*. . the incidence has been rising continuously since as early as 1940, but this increase has mainly occurred in indoor but not outdoor workers. . .
*. .higher 25-(OH)-D levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with both thinner tumors and better survival . . .
*’Nitric oxide production in the skin is increased at the same time by UV-A, which lowers the system blood pressure, indicating that there are many activities of natural sunlight extending beyond vitamin D
*Are your chances of dying – compared to a population without BCC or SCC – better or worse? 
+The answer is surprising and unexpected: 
+you are going to live longer, by ~9%, if you have been diagnosed with a BCC based on a 10–year mortality rate ratio (MRR = 0.91)

(all of the following are on the VitaminDWiki, but do not have time to make all of the hyperlinks)
*Seniors need 3X as much time in the sun to get same amount of vitamin D
*Need about 2X more if overweight
*Various anti-oxidants reduce the chance of sunburns
*Maximize the amount of vitamin D while minimizing the chance of sunburn 
+by spending a small amount of time out in the hot sun with a minimum of clothing.
*Perhaps having enough vitamin D reduces chance of sunburning

&lt;p>Accumulating epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested that vitamin D insufficiency may be associated with hypertension. Blacks tend to have lower vitamin D levels than Whites, but it is unclear whether this difference explains the higher blood pressure (BP) observed in Blacks in a population with healthy lifestyle practices.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>One of the 4 vitamin D metabolites increases faster than the others</title><link>/posts/one-of-the-4-vitamin-d-metabolites-increases-faster-than-the-others.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/one-of-the-4-vitamin-d-metabolites-increases-faster-than-the-others.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="simultaneous-quantification-of-four-vitamin-d-metabolites-in-human-serum-using-high-performance-liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry-for-vitamin-d-profiling">Simultaneous quantification of four vitamin D metabolites in human serum using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for vitamin D profiling.&lt;/h4>

!!Highlights from [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/got-milk-you-dont-need-it/ |New York Times blog on Milk July 2012] 
!!!By Bittman, author of book: Food Matters
*US Department of Agriculture, encouraged by the Dairy lobby, had recommended 2 lbs of milk per day ( four 8 ounce glasses)
*We do not consume 2 lbs of anything else per day
+Even the per-capita consumption of soda is only 1 lb per day
*Now they have reduced the recommendation to [http://www.choosemyplate.gov/food-groups/dairy-amount.html| 3 cups] = 1.5 lbs per day
*But, 50 million Americans are lactose intolerant
+90% of Asian-Americans
+75% of African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Jews
+__~~#090:Note: 100 IU of vitamin D in one 8 ounce glass of milk, so 3 glasses per day = a paltry 300 IU~~__
!!! Highlights from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001321/|NIH]
*Premature babies sometimes have lactose intolerance.
*Approximately 30 million American adults have some amount of lactose intolerance by age 20.
!!!Highlights from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_intolerance|Wikipedia]
*Most mammals normally become lactose intolerant after weaning, but some human populations have developed
+ __lactase persistence__, in which lactase production continues into adulthood. 
*It is estimated that __75% of adults worldwide show some decrease in lactase activity during adulthood__
*It has now been shown that lactase persistence is caused by several independently occurring mutations.
+__~~#090:Hmm! Having problems with lactose is the norm for all animals, tolerance is the mutation in some humans~~__
||Dairy product|	Serving size	|% Lactose
Milk, regular	|250 ml	|4.8%
Milk, reduced fat|	250 ml	|5.2%
Yogurt, plain, regular|	200 g	|4.5%
Yogurt, plain, low-fat	|200 g	|6.0%
Ice cream	|50 g|6.0%
Butter	|1 tsp (5.9ml)	|0.5%
Cottage cheese	|30 g	|0.3%
Cheddar cheese	|30 g	|0.07%||

!!!!Calcium bioavailability highlights from [http://www.livestrong.com/article/454597-how-much-calcium-is-absorbed-at-a-time/|LiveStrong]
*&amp;lt; 5 % spinach, rhubarb and Swiss chard is absorbed, due to oxalates
*20% almonds, sesame seeds, sweet potatoes and pinto beans
*30 % milk, cheese and yogurt __~~#00F:{Note: probably varies with vitamin D fortification and fat content}~~__
*50% Brussels sprouts, kale, mustard greens, broccoli, bok choy, cauliflower
!!!!Speculation by VitaminDWiki
*Back when milk was fortified with vitamin D perhaps 85% of Americans could drink milk
*Now it appears only about 63% of American can drink milk.
*Wonder when alternate foods will be fortified with vitamin D - in the US and around the world?

&lt;p>Background:Vitamin D, classically involved in calcium homeostasis, has garnered recent interest for its potential role in cancer prevention and therapy. Although few risk factors have been established in the development of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, some would argue that no clear modifiable risk factor exists. Our study is one of the first to explore the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3X more abdominal obesity among Korean children having low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/3x-more-abdominal-obesity-among-korean-children-having-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/3x-more-abdominal-obesity-among-korean-children-having-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-levels-obesity-and-the-metabolic-syndrome-among-korean-children">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, obesity and the metabolic syndrome among Korean children.&lt;/h4>

!!!!Season of Birth and Exceptional Longevity: Comparative Study of American Centenarians, Their Siblings, and Spouses
Journal of Aging Research, Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 104616, 11 pages
Leonid A. Gavrilov and Natalia S. Gavrilova
Center on Economics and Demography of Aging, NORC at the University of Chicago, 1155 East 60th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA

This study explores the effects of month of birth (a proxy for early-life environmental influences) on the chances of survival to age 100. Months of birth for 1,574 validated centenarians born in the United States in 1880–1895 were compared to the same information obtained for centenarians&amp;#39; 10,885 shorter-lived siblings and 1,083 spouses. Comparison was conducted using a within-family analysis by the method of conditional logistic regression, which allows researchers to control for unobserved shared childhood or adulthood environment and common genetic background. It was found that months of birth have significant long-lasting effect on survival to age 100: siblings born in September–November have higher odds to become centenarians compared to siblings born in March. A similar month-of-birth pattern was found for centenarian spouses. These results support the idea of early-life programming of human aging and longevity.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>15 reasons to think that schizophrenia is associated with low vitamin D&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>97% of patients with schizophrenia are vitamin D deficient&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia varies with latitude (UVB) by 10X (controversy)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is more common in those with dark skin (when away from the equator)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is associated with low natal vitamin D&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia has been increasing around the world when vitamin D has been decreasing (controversy)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Schizophrenia is associated with low birth rate, which is associated with low vitamin D&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Survey finds that Non-Caucasians do not feel that people need sun exposure</title><link>/posts/survey-finds-that-non-caucasians-do-not-feel-that-people-need-sun-exposure.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/survey-finds-that-non-caucasians-do-not-feel-that-people-need-sun-exposure.html</guid><description>&lt;pre style="background-color: #e0e0e0; white-space: pre-wrap;">

Abstract: The main objective of this study was to examine certain beliefs about vitamin D and associations with sun exposure, sun protection behaviors, and sunburns. A total of 3,922 lifeguards, pool managers, and parents completed a survey in 2006 about beliefs regarding vitamin D and sun-related behaviors. Multivariate ordinal regression analyses and linear regression analysis were used to examine associations of beliefs and other variables. Results revealed that Non-Caucasian lifeguards and pool managers were less likely to agree that they needed to go out in the sun to get enough vitamin D.

 Lifeguards and parents who were non-Caucasian were less likely to report that sunlight helped the body to produce vitamin D. 
A stronger belief about the need to go out in the sun to get enough vitamin D predicted more sun exposure for lifeguards. 
For parents, a stronger belief that they can get enough vitamin D from foods predicted greater sun protection and a stronger belief that sunlight helps the body produce vitamin D predicted lower sun exposure. This study provides information regarding vitamin D beliefs and their association with certain sun related behaviors across different demographic groups that can inform education efforts about vitamin D and sun protection.

&lt;p>Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) levels have been associated with lower FEV(1), impaired immunologic control, and increased airway inflammation.

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is a serious global issue. Although the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> test is generally the most accurate way to assess vitamin D levels, the optimal range of 25(OH)D has yet to be established. Moreover, the optimal level may vary according to race, region, and age. Suboptimal vitamin D status is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are the major risk factors for cardiovascular disorders; however, these relationships in children and adolescents have yet to be clearly determined. Therefore, we identified the best predictive cut-off value for reflecting abdominal obesity and, based on this value, we investigated the relationship between suboptimal 25(OH)D status and the risk for having abdominal obesity, being overweight or obese, and having metabolic syndrome in Korean adolescents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Probability of getting TB reduced 60 percent with just 800 IU of vitamin D – RCT</title><link>/posts/probability-of-getting-tb-reduced-60-percent-with-just-800-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/probability-of-getting-tb-reduced-60-percent-with-just-800-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct.html</guid><description>&lt;pre style="background-color: #e0e0e0; white-space: pre-wrap;">

Background: By modulating immune function, vitamin D might increase innate immunity and inhibit the growth of initial bacterial invasion and protect against tuberculosis infection.

Objective: We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion.

Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 120 Mongol schoolchildren. We estimated the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection at baseline and examined the effect of vitamin D (800 IU/d) on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and TST conversion.

Results: At baseline, the mean (±SD) 25(OH)D concentration was 7 ± 4 ng/mL, and all concentrations were &amp;lt;20 ng/mL. 
Vitamin D supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D by a mean of 12.7 ng/mL compared with placebo (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). 

At baseline, 16 children in the vitamin D group and 18 in the placebo group were TST positive (P = 0.7). 
Over 6 mo, TSTs converted to positive in 5 (11%) children receiving vitamin D compared with 11 (27%) receiving placebo (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.09; P = 0.06). 

Only one TST conversion occurred among those whose serum 25(OH)D concentration increased to &amp;gt;20 ng/mL, 
whereas 8 TST conversions occurred in those whose final 25(OH)D concentration remained &amp;lt;10 ng/mL (P = 0.05). 

The mean increase in stature was 2.9 ± 1.6 cm in the vitamin D group and 2.0 ± 1.7 cm in the placebo group (95% CI: 2.16, 2.81; P &amp;lt; 0.003).

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation for 6 mo had significant favorable effects on serum 25(OH)D concentrations and on growth in stature. 
A trend was seen toward fewer TST conversions in the vitamin D group. 

This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01244204|NCT01244204.]

!!Clipped from [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/247320.php |Severe Sleep Loss Affects Immune System Like Physical Stress Does] Medical News Today

!Note – no mention of vitamin D in the abstract 

Found a link between lack of sleep and the development of certain diseases and conditions, such as 
*high blood pressure (hypertension), 
*diabetes and 
*obesity.

Study deprived 15 men of sleep for 27 hours. When deprived of sleep &amp;quot;The granulocytes reacted immediately to the physical stress of sleep loss and directly mirrored the body&amp;#39;s stress response.&amp;quot;

A granulocyte is a type of white blood cell that is full of microscopic granules - tiny sacs that contain enzymes for digesting microorganisms. Granulocytes form part of our innate immune system.

!!Diurnal Rhythms in Blood Cell Populations and the Effect of Acute Sleep Deprivation in Healthy Young Men

The sleep/wake cycle is accompanied by changes in circulating numbers of immune cells. The goal of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of diurnal rhythms in different blood cell populations and to investigate the effect of acute sleep deprivation on the immune system, as an indicator of the body&amp;#39;s acute stress response.

Setting: Home environment and Clinical Research Centre.

Participants: 15 healthy male participants aged 23.7 ± 5.4 (standard deviation) yr.

Interventions: Total sleep deprivation.

Measurements and Results:

Diurnal rhythms of several blood cell populations were assessed under a normal sleep/wake cycle followed by 29 hr of extended wakefulness. The effect of condition (sleep versus sleep deprivation) on peak time and amplitude was investigated. Interindividual variation of, and the level of correlation between, the different cell populations was assessed.

Comprehensive nonlinear curve fitting showed significant diurnal rhythms for all blood cell types investigated, with CD4 (naïve) cells exhibiting the most robust rhythms independent of condition. For those participants exhibiting significant diurnal rhythms in blood cell populations, only the amplitude of the granulocyte rhythm was significantly reduced by sleep deprivation. Granulocytes were the most diverse population, being most strongly affected by condition, and showed the lowest correlations with any other given cell type while exhibiting the largest interindividual variation in abundance.

Conclusions:
Granulocyte levels and diurnal rhythmicity are directly affected by acute sleep deprivation; these changes mirror the body&amp;#39;s immediate immune response upon exposure to stress.

__Figure 1. The percent drop in the ability to make vitamin D3 in human skin with age.__
	 {img fileId=2162}
We normalized values to 100% using the children&amp;#39;s values (0-20 yr). 
The data plotted is the average of vitamin D3 formed in the epidermis and dermis from 0-20 yr (100%), 22-40 yr (83%), 41-59 yr (66%) and 60+ yr (49%); calculated from the data in Figure 1 of MacLaughlin and Holick (1985). 
Note that some seniors over 70 yr make less than 25% of the vitamin D that children &amp;lt;21 yr can make.67 {[tiki-download_file.php?fileId=2163|__~~#090:In VitaminDWiki}~~__]

│ full_match: `. We investigated the relationship between serum calcifediol levels and vertebral fractures (VF), vascular calcifications (VC) and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Within a multicenter, cross-sectional study in 18 hospital based dialysis centers in Italy, we included 387 hemodialysis patients (143 F, 37% ; 244 M, 63%), mean age 64±14 (SD) years, median dialytic age 49 months, BMI 25± 4 Kg/m2. We determined total 25(OH)D using the LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D kit (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater MN, USA). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis of scanned L-L vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of &amp;gt; 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). Fracture severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20–25%, 25–40% or &amp;gt;40%, respectively). VC assessments were also centralized. Witteman’s method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe &amp;gt;10 cm). We also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe &amp;gt;5cm). Any differences in VC were resolved by consensus. Follow up was 2.7±0.5 years. \n\nBone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L and median PTH 244 pg/ml. We found a median 25(OH)D level of 28.9 ng/ml. Nine ( 2.3%) patients had vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;10 ng/ml), 198 (51.2%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency (between 10-29.9 ng/ml) and 180 (46.5%) patients had normal levels ( &amp;gt;30 ng/ml). We found that 55% of patients had VF and 30.9% of patients had BF. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and 55,1% in the iliac arteries. Males had more VF than Females (60% versus 48%, P=0.019). \n- - - - - - - - - -\n`

!!!ASSOCIATION OF CALCIFEDIOL LEVELS WITH VERTEBRAL FRACTURES, VASCULAR CALCIFICATIONS AND MORTALITY.
Kidney Research and Clinical Practice, Volume 31, Issue 2, Page A31

The best biomarker of Vitamin D status is calcifediol [25(OH)D]. We investigated the relationship between serum calcifediol levels and vertebral fractures (VF), vascular calcifications (VC) and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Within a multicenter, cross-sectional study in 18 hospital based dialysis centers in Italy, we included 387 hemodialysis patients (143 F, 37% ; 244 M, 63%), mean age 64±14 (SD) years, median dialytic age 49 months, BMI 25± 4 Kg/m2. We determined total 25(OH)D using the LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D kit (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater MN, USA). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis of scanned L-L vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of &amp;gt; 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). Fracture severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20–25%, 25–40% or &amp;gt;40%, respectively). VC assessments were also centralized. Witteman’s method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe &amp;gt;10 cm). We also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe &amp;gt;5cm). Any differences in VC were resolved by consensus. Follow up was 2.7±0.5 years. 

Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L and median PTH 244 pg/ml. We found a median 25(OH)D level of 28.9 ng/ml. Nine ( 2.3%) patients had vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;10 ng/ml), 198 (51.2%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency (between 10-29.9 ng/ml) and 180 (46.5%) patients had normal levels ( &amp;gt;30 ng/ml). We found that 55% of patients had VF and 30.9% of patients had BF. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and 55,1% in the iliac arteries. Males had more VF than Females (60% versus 48%, P=0.019).

No associations were found between VF and biochemical parameters including calcifediol levels (p=0.662), 
while we found an association between low calcifediol levels and a higher prevalence of severe aortic calcifications (36.8 vs 28.2, p=0.0044). 

Furthermore, we found a __OR 1.85__ (1.04-3.29 CI, p=0.0367) for Aortic Calcification in patients with calcifediol levels lower than the median value of 29 ng/ml. 

During follow-up (2.7±0.5 years) mortality was of 19.9%. 

No association was found between mortality and calcifediol levels (p=0.5394). 

In conclusion, despite good control of bone and mineral metabolism parameters, hemodialysis patients showed high prevalence of VF and VC. Our study suggests that high calcifediol levels could be protective against progression of severe aortic calcification

!The Female Athlete Triad
Sports Health: A Multidisciplinary Approach July/August 2012 vol. 4 no. 4 302-311

Context: The __female athlete triad__ (the triad) is an interrelationship of 
#menstrual dysfunction, 
#low energy availability (with or without an eating disorder), and 
#decreased bone mineral density; 
it is relatively common among young women participating in sports. 

Diagnosis and treatment of this potentially serious condition is complicated and often requires an interdisciplinary team.

Evidence Acquisition: Articles from 1981 to present found on PubMed were selected for review of major components of the female athlete triad as well as strategies for diagnosis and treatment of the conditions.

Results: The main goal in treatment of young female athletes with the triad is a natural return of menses as well as enhancement of bone mineral density. While no specific drug intervention has been shown to consistently improve bone mineral density in this patient population, maximizing energy availability and __optimizing vitamin D and calcium intake__ are recommended.

Conclusions: Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach involving health care professionals as well as coaches and family members. Prevention of this condition is important to minimize complications of the female athlete triad.

!!Wonder: 
#Is this triad is more prevalent with __indoor __female athletes – who get less sunshine?
#Is this triad is more prevalent at higher latitudes? – who get less sunshine?
#Is this triad is more prevalent with women with darker skins? – who get less benefit from sunshine?
#Is this triad less prevalent in women on the pill - as they lose less blood/iron
!!Notes:
*All three elements of the triad have been separately associated with low vitamin D
*Vitamin D is very important for athletes

An evaluation of the vitamin D status of adult Americans (22-40, 41-59, 60+ yr) show many have deficient or insufficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, indicating they are not getting enough from sunlight or dietary sources. Those findings are in conflict with calculated values that insist people make “ample” vitamin D3 (?1,000 IU/day) from their “casual” or everyday outdoor exposures.\n\nObjective: We investigated this situation using the outdoor UV doses of indoor-working adult Americans (~7,000) in the north (45°N) and south (35°N) to calculate how much vitamin D3 they produce each season of the year with and without vacationing.\n\nMethod: To do vitamin D3 calculations properly, we used action spectrum and geometric conversion factors, not previously incorporated into other calculations.\n\nResults: Few indoor-working adults over 21 yr meet their daily vitamin D needs from everyday outdoor exposures anytime during the year, including summer. Only a few “outdoorsy” Caucasians (22-60 yr) can meet their vitamin D3 needs (~2,000 IU/day) during the summer, but only if they do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations.\n\nConclusions: Most indoor-working adult Americans do not go outside enough to meet their vitamin D3 needs all year. Only some outdoor-working adults can make enough vitamin D3 without using sunscreen but other adults cannot, even with a vacation during the summer. Indoor-working African Americans can never make enough vitamin D3 during the year even with a 3-week vacation.\n`

In addition, they only measured the UV exposures and 25(OH)D blood levels of 25 people, but they failed to disclose how many of those people worked outdoors. In contrast, a very large European study (&amp;gt;12,000 people) found about 60% of the English workers at 52°N had blood levels of 25(OH)D below 75 nmol/L during the summer months.57 Their findings agree with our estimates that about half the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; (clothing) amount of vitamin D, Caucasian Americans make at 40°N (&amp;lt;800 IU/day) can be made at 52°N (&amp;lt;400 IU/day) based on erythemally-weighted doses measured at the same latitude in the Netherlands.58 People at 52°N receive about half the annual erythemally-weighted UV dose that Americans get at ~40°N, and consequently would make about half the amount of vitamin D Americans make during any season of the year.\n\nThe epidemiology results and our calculated amounts of vitamin D/day produced by Americans (&amp;gt;21 yr) significantly differ from what the American Academy of Dermatology claims.42 They claim people can make &amp;quot;ample&amp;quot; vitamin D, (&amp;gt;1,000 IU/day) from &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; sun exposure, even if they diligently wear SPF 15 sunscreen. However, they did not convert the erythemally-weighted UV doses to previtamin D -weighted UV doses and they did not convert horizontal plane doses to full-cylinder or actual body doses; they also did not take age into account. In contrast to their claims, we find the majority of indoor-working adult Americans are not going outside enough all year to get adequate everyday sun exposure to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) they need. Only some &amp;quot;out-doorsy&amp;quot; indoor-working Caucasians can make optimal vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) during the summer and some other skin types if they wear sporty clothing to work, take a 2—3 week vacation at latitudes &amp;lt;40°N (see Fig. 5), and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. The only other people who can make enough vitamin D are some of the outdoor-working adult Americans (~5% of the population). The most serious situation occurs with seniors (60+ yr) who cannot even make the minimum amount of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) all year even with a 3-week vacation. Furthermore, if anyone wears sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D (see in ref. 44).\n\nWe also find that almost all indoor-working adult Americans are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures all year to make optimal amounts of vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day).53,59-61 Some people with skin type II and some men with skin types III and IV can make the optimal amounts of vitamin D3 during the summer if they also take a 2—3 wk vacation (Fig. 5). However, if they wear sunscreen of SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D all year including during the summer (see in ref. 44). Thus, as found in the NHANES III study, Caucasian adult Americans with Fitzpatrick skin type II, and especially the darker skin types III, IV and V/VI, are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures for most of the year to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D, to prevent deficiency. The situation would be much worse if they diligently wore sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15. The African-Americans have a similar situation from melanin protection, which may explain the disparity in health found between whites and blacks.62 Furthermore, neither diet nor supplements correct this situation.63-65 In fact, 83% of Australian dermatologists, who advise people to take vitamin D supplements rather than get more UV exposure, have insufficient blood levels of 25(OH) D.66 Because the UV doses of indoor-working people around the world are similar to ours at similar latitudes (25—50°N),58 vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L or 30 ng/ml) is also found around the world, especially at higher latitudes (&amp;gt;50°N) and in countries that do not fortify foods.63 As a result, vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem with serious health consequences,67 which occurs from too little sun exposure.\n`

In addition, they only measured the UV exposures and 25(OH)D blood levels of 25 people, but they failed to disclose how many of those people worked outdoors. In contrast, a very large European study (&amp;gt;12,000 people) found about 60% of the English workers at 52°N had blood levels of 25(OH)D below 75 nmol/L during the summer months.57 Their findings agree with our estimates that about half the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; (clothing) amount of vitamin D, Caucasian Americans make at 40°N (&amp;lt;800 IU/day) can be made at 52°N (&amp;lt;400 IU/day) based on erythemally-weighted doses measured at the same latitude in the Netherlands.58 People at 52°N receive about half the annual erythemally-weighted UV dose that Americans get at ~40°N, and consequently would make about half the amount of vitamin D Americans make during any season of the year.\n\nThe epidemiology results and our calculated amounts of vitamin D/day produced by Americans (&amp;gt;21 yr) significantly differ from what the American Academy of Dermatology claims.42 They claim people can make &amp;quot;ample&amp;quot; vitamin D, (&amp;gt;1,000 IU/day) from &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; sun exposure, even if they diligently wear SPF 15 sunscreen. However, they did not convert the erythemally-weighted UV doses to previtamin D -weighted UV doses and they did not convert horizontal plane doses to full-cylinder or actual body doses; they also did not take age into account. In contrast to their claims, we find the majority of indoor-working adult Americans are not going outside enough all year to get adequate everyday sun exposure to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) they need. Only some &amp;quot;out-doorsy&amp;quot; indoor-working Caucasians can make optimal vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) during the summer and some other skin types if they wear sporty clothing to work, take a 2—3 week vacation at latitudes &amp;lt;40°N (see Fig. 5), and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. The only other people who can make enough vitamin D are some of the outdoor-working adult Americans (~5% of the population). The most serious situation occurs with seniors (60+ yr) who cannot even make the minimum amount of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) all year even with a 3-week vacation. Furthermore, if anyone wears sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D (see in ref. 44).\n\nWe also find that almost all indoor-working adult Americans are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures all year to make optimal amounts of vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day).53,59-61 Some people with skin type II and some men with skin types III and IV can make the optimal amounts of vitamin D3 during the summer if they also take a 2—3 wk vacation (Fig. 5). However, if they wear sunscreen of SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D all year including during the summer (see in ref. 44). Thus, as found in the NHANES III study, Caucasian adult Americans with Fitzpatrick skin type II, and especially the darker skin types III, IV and V/VI, are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures for most of the year to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D, to prevent deficiency.

We obtained the outdoor solar doses every season of the year for indoor-working adults (~95% population) from reference 46.\n\nThe equation for calculating the amount of vitamin D produced by people from an average daily, erythemally-weighted UV exposure during each season of the year is: Vitamin D3 (IU)/day = VDD x (4,861 IU/SED for skin type II) x STF x from outdoor UV exposures will depend on how much skin they expose to the sun while they are outside or their Fraction Body Exposed (FBE), so that one needs to multiply the FBE by the amount made from a whole body exposure (4,861 IU/ SED).44 We get the best estimates of how much body area adult Americans expose during each season of the year using the &amp;quot;rule of nines,&amp;quot; originally developed to estimate burn areas.70 To make these estimates, we assumed most adults would expose their face (3.5%), the front half of their neck (1%) and the front and back of both their hands (5%) during all seasons of the year, including winter (FBE is 9.5%; long-sleeved shirts/blouses and long pants/skirts). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose their lower arms (6%) during the spring and fall (FBE is 15.5%). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose half of their upper arms (4%; short-sleeved shirts or tee shirts) and all of their lower legs (14%; knee-length shorts/skirts) during the entire summer (FBE is 33.5%). However, adults have to work during the summer, so that they tend to expose only about 9.5—15.5% of their body (face, neck, hands and sometimes their lower arms) during their workweek. Thus, the amounts made during the summer are closer to half the values shown in the figures. For the children and adult body percentages exposed during each season see Table 1 of reference 44. The FBE is the percent body area exposed divided by 100%.\nThe final part of the calculation involves the ability of an adult to make vitamin D with age because it decreases with increasing age due to epidermal thinning.51 Because children (&amp;lt;22 yr) have the highest ability to make vitamin D , they have an age factor (AF) of unity compared to older adults; all other values are relative to theirs (Fig. 1): 0—20 yr (100% or 1.0), 22—40 yr (83% or 0.83), 41—59 yr (66% or 0.66) and 60+ yr (49% or 0.49). Note that adults over 70 yr can make as little as 25% of what children can make,67 so that our calculations are on the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; side for the eldest adults (60+ yr).\n\nOne can do the sunscreen calculations by simply dividing the amount of vitamin D made without sunscreen (equation above) by the SPF factor.71 These numbers only apply to people who diligently wear sunscreens correctly, i.e., they generously apply them prior to going outdoors, covering their entire body and they reapply them every 2 hours.\n\nTo convert IU of vitamin D to ng/ml blood levels of 25(OH) D multiply by 0.01,60 and to convert 25-(OH)D ng/ml to 25(OH) D nmol/L multiply by 2.599,71 or multiply IU of vitamin D by 0.0385 to get 25-(OH)D nmol/L directly.\n\nBasically, 100 IU of ingested vitamin D raises blood levels of 25(OH)D by 0.6—1 ng/ml.52,53\n`

Background: Sunlight contains UV radiation that affects human health in both detrimental (skin cancers) and beneficial (vitamin D3) ways. An evaluation of the vitamin D status of adult Americans (22-40, 41-59, 60+ yr) show many have deficient or insufficient serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, indicating they are not getting enough from sunlight or dietary sources. Those findings are in conflict with calculated values that insist people make “ample” vitamin D3 (?1,000 IU/day) from their “casual” or everyday outdoor exposures.

Objective: We investigated this situation using the outdoor UV doses of indoor-working adult Americans (~7,000) in the north (45°N) and south (35°N) to calculate how much vitamin D3 they produce each season of the year with and without vacationing.

Method: To do vitamin D3 calculations properly, we used action spectrum and geometric conversion factors, not previously incorporated into other calculations.

Results: Few indoor-working adults over 21 yr meet their daily vitamin D needs from everyday outdoor exposures anytime during the year, including summer. Only a few “outdoorsy” Caucasians (22-60 yr) can meet their vitamin D3 needs (~2,000 IU/day) during the summer, but only if they do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations.

Conclusions: Most indoor-working adult Americans do not go outside enough to meet their vitamin D3 needs all year. Only some outdoor-working adults can make enough vitamin D3 without using sunscreen but other adults cannot, even with a vacation during the summer. Indoor-working African Americans can never make enough vitamin D3 during the year even with a 3-week vacation.

!Introduction
Sunlight can affect human health because it contains UV radiation (290—400 nm) that has both detrimental (skin cancers) and beneficial (vitamin D_) health effects. Vitamin D, is formed in human skin when the UVB photons (290—315 nm) in sunlight break the B ring of the precursor molecule, 7-dehydrocholes-terol or provitamin D forming previtamin D , which thermally isomerizes (37°C) to vitamin D, by a membrane enhanced mechanism.1,2

Vitamin D affects a variety of adult health problems besides osteoporosis and osteomalcia. It lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients3,4 and the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disorders.5-8 Vitamin D decreases the incidence of type 2 diabetes,9,10 rheumatoid arthritis,11,12 and it prevents tooth loss13 and falls that can result in hip fractures of the elderly.14-16 The most hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvi-tamin D (1,25(OH) D), can affect a variety of cancers because cancer cells produce 1,25(OH)„D from either 25(OH)D17 or vitamin D,18 which can kill them via apoptotic cell death. This hormonal conversion to 1,25(OH) D inside the cancer cell may be responsible for reducing the mortality from different cancers:19 colon, breast, prostate, ovarian and melanoma.20-26 In support of those findings, is the reverse observation that about half the patients attending an outpatient, cancer-care clinic in Boston were vitamin D deficient during the summer.27 Production of 1,25(OH)„D in skin cells may be important for decreasing the incidence of melanoma28 because it causes growth inhibition and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo of melanoma cells.29-31 Ironically, regular, moderate sun exposures increase the survival of melanoma patients.20 In fact, more deaths occur from internal cancers and disorders associated with low UV exposures (50,000—63,000/yr), which are often related to lower serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D), than from high UV exposures that are often related to skin cancers, especially melanoma (about 10,000/yr).32,33 
doses relative to the horizontal plane to UV doses relevant to the human body using geometric conversion factors (GCF).49 We calculated both male and female indoor-working adult Americans&amp;#39; (22—40, 41—59, 60+ yr) vitamin D production in international units (IU) produced by Fitzpatrick skin types II, III, IV and V50 during each season of the year in the north (45°N) and south (35°N). We also take the decreasing capacity to make vitamin D with increasing age into account 51 and calculate the average amount people make everyday during the summer with or without a 1—3-week mixed vacation.

We normalized values to 100% using the children&amp;#39;s values (0-20 yr). 
The data plotted is the average of vitamin D3 formed in the epidermis and dermis from 0-20 yr (100%), 22-40 yr (83%), 41-59 yr (66%) and 60+ yr (49%); calculated from the data in Figure 1 of MacLaughlin and Holick (1985). 
Note that some seniors over 70 yr make less than 25% of the vitamin D that children &amp;lt;21 yr can make.67 {[tiki-download_file.php?fileId=2163|__~~#090:In VitaminDWik)i~~__]

For most people, their major source of vitamin D comes from exposing their skin to sunlight,34 which creates a public health dilemma because the UV radiation in sunlight also causes skin cancers. Skin cancers have been increasing at the alarming rate of about 4% (±1%) each year, so that health organizations have been warning the public to avoid sun exposure between 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. and have been advising them to wear protective clothing, sunglasses and sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) &amp;gt;15 while outdoors.35 However, the vitamin D status, measured in serum as 25(OH)D (where the &amp;#39;D&amp;#39; represents D or D), shows many American adults have insufficient levels (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L or &amp;lt;30 ng/ml) 17 for most of the year, especially during and after winter.36-41 These observations disagree with a recent publication by the American Academy of Dermatology that claims Americans are getting adequate &amp;quot;casual,&amp;quot; or everyday, UV exposures even if they diligently wear SPF 15 sunscreen, to make ample (&amp;gt;1,000 IU/day) vitamin D .42

However, we found many American children (&amp;lt;20 yr) are not getting enough everyday outdoor UV exposures43 to meet either their minimum (600 IU/day) or optimum (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) vitamin D needs for most of the year, except some Caucasian children during the summer, but only if they do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations.44 African American children are not even making the minimum amount of vitamin D all year due to the increased sunscreening effect of the melanin in their skin.45

Here we investigated the indoor-working adult American&amp;#39;s (&amp;gt;22 yr) situation by calculating the amount of vitamin D, they make from their everyday exposure to sunlight. We used UV doses calculated46 from an Environmental Protection Agency two-year survey of 9,386 Americans,47 over 7,000 of which were adults, located all over the contiguous United States (US). We first adjusted their erythemally-weighted UV doses to previtamin D -weighted UV doses using action spectrum conversion factors (ASCF),48 and then adjusted those previtamin D -weighted UV
Figure 1 shows a decreasing capacity to make vitamin D with increasing age. We normalized the data from MacLaughlin and Holick (1985) 51 using the American children (0—20 yr) because they have the highest capacity to make vitamin D, (100% or 1.0). Compared to American children (&amp;lt;22 yr), the youngest adult Americans (22—40 yr) have 83% (or 0.83) and the middle-aged adults (41—59 yr) have 66% (or 0.66), while the senior adults (60+ yr) only have 49% (or 0.49) their capacity to make vitamin D . We used these fractions in the vitamin D3 calculations for the different age groups of adults presented in Figures 2—5.

!!Figure 2A Northern US

shows the average amounts of vitamin D, (IU/day) made by indoor-working adult Americans of reproductive/child-rearing ages (22—40 yr) with Fitzpatrick skin types II—V during each season of the year, excluding vacations and sunscreen use (see in ref. 44) in the north (45°N, Fig. 2A) and south (35°N, Fig. 2B). 
Caucasians with skin type II (also includes type I) can make the minimum amount of vitamin D, (~600 IU/day) during the summer so that they are not deficient, but only if they wear &amp;quot;sporty&amp;quot; clothing and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. 
Almost no one else, except some outdoor workers, in the young adult age group can make enough vitamin D to meet his or her needs all year.

!!Figure 3 
shows the average amounts of vitamin D, (IU/day) made by middle-aged (41—59 yr) indoor-working Americans with Fitzpatrick skin types II—V during each season of the year, excluding vacations and sunscreen use, in the north (45°N; Fig. 3A) and south (35°N, Fig. 3B). Again, only Caucasians with skin type II (and type I) can make enough vitamin D to meet their needs during the summer, but only if they wear &amp;quot;sporty&amp;quot; clothing and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. Almost no one else, except some outdoor workers, can make enough vitamin D to meet his or her needs all year.

!!Figure 4 
shows the average amounts of vitamin D, (IU/day) made by senior (60+ yr) indoor-working or retired Americans with Fitzpatrick skin types II—V during each season of the year, excluding vacations and sunscreen use, in the north (45°N; Fig. 4A) and south (35°N; Fig. 4B). Almost no one in the senior group can make the minimum amount of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) all year so that they are not deficient. No senior can meet their vitamin D need all year from everyday exposures even with a 3-week vacation (see Fig. 5), unless they either work or stay outdoors for most of the day, to have sufficient blood levels of 25(OH)D (&amp;gt;50 nmol/L or &amp;gt;20 ng/ml).

!!Figure 5 
{img fileId=2164}
shows the average amount of vitamin D indoor-working adults over 21 yr can make each day during the summer without and with a 1-, 2- or 3-week summer vacation. These vacation estimates include the use of the equivalent of SPF 4 sunscreen only during a beach vacation and are averages of four different types of vacations: beach, sightseeing, country and home.46 Only some skin type II Caucasians (22—40 yr) will meet their minimum vitamin D needs (~600 IU/day) during the summer, and some can possibly meet their optimum vitamin D needs (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/ day) if they take a 2-week vacation. The older Caucasians (60+) and skin type III will need at least a 3-week vacation. However, no other indoor-working adult will meet their minimum vitamin D needs (600—800 IU/day), let alone their optimum needs (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day), all year even with a 3-week vacation at 40°N.

!!Discussion
According to current findings, people need ~2,000 IU/day to maintain blood levels of 25(OH)D above 75 nmol/L or 30 ng/ml.52,53 Our calculations revealed that only some &amp;quot;outdoorsy&amp;quot; indoor-working Caucasians of skin type II (22—59 yr) may make optimal amounts of vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) during the summer, but only if they expose more than 30% of their body every day to sunlight, take a 2—3 week vacation at latitudes &amp;lt;40°N, and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. The summer values shown in the figures are very optimistic because most adults work indoors (&amp;gt;90%) and, consequently, wear more clothing during their workweek, exposing only ~10—15% of their body to UV. Thus, most indoor-working adults that wear professional clothing will actually make about half the values shown in the figures during the summer and will not meet their minimum vitamin D needs. As people age, their ability to make vitamin D from the same UV exposure decreases (Fig. 1) so that only the most active &amp;quot;outdoorsy&amp;quot; Caucasian adults over 60 yr can make the minimum amount of vitamin D (800 IU/day) they need during the summer to prevent deficiency (&amp;gt;50 nmol/L; Figs. 2—4). Caucasians over 60 yr with skin type II, and all other skin types over 21 yr do not meet their minimum vitamin D needs from everyday outdoor exposures all year and would need to be supplemented,54 except some people during the summer if they wear sporty clothing to work and also take a 2—3 week vacation (see Fig. 5).

Overall our findings agree with reports of vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;50 nmol/L; &amp;lt;20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L;

!!Figure 2. 
The average amount of vitamin D3 (IU/day) indoor-working adult men and women of reproductive age (22-40 yr) with skin types II-V make from everyday outdoor UV exposures each season in the (A) Northern (45°N) and (B) Southern (35°N) US.

&amp;lt;30 ng/ml) among adults in the US.36-41 Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency increases with increasing latitude, age and skin color, so that almost all adult African Americans are deficient in vitamin D during and after winter and about half have insufficient levels during the summer. Unless an adult works outdoors for most of the day, especially the darker skin types, they cannot get enough UV exposure to make the minimum amount of vitamin D (~600 IU/day) so that they are not deficient, and they cannot possibly make optimal amounts of vitamin D to be sufficient (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) without supplementation unless they work outdoors (~5% US population).

The average time indoor-working adults stay outdoors during the summer months in the US is 93.5 ± 2.5 min/day in the south at ~35°N and 102.5 ± 5.5 min/day in the north at ~45°N.46 If that increasing time trend from south-to-north continues during the summer, we would expect people living around 55°N to stay outdoors for about 111.5 ± 9 min/day or less than 2 hr/day. However, Thieden et al. (2009) found Danish workers at ~56°N stay outdoors for almost 3 hr/day during the summer and have 25(OH)D blood levels ~82 nmol/L, similar to outdoor workers.56

!!Figure 3. 
The average amount of vitamin D3 (IU/day) indoor-working adult men and women of middle age (41-59 yr) with skin types II-V make from everyday outdoor UV exposures each season in the (A) Northern (45°N) and (B) Southern (35°N) US.

Their study mixed outdoor worker&amp;#39;s (gardeners) times with indoor worker&amp;#39;s times, which increased the overall time outdoors. In addition, they only measured the UV exposures and 25(OH)D blood levels of 25 people, but they failed to disclose how many of those people worked outdoors. In contrast, a very large European study (&amp;gt;12,000 people) found about 60% of the English workers at 52°N had blood levels of 25(OH)D below 75 nmol/L during the summer months.57 Their findings agree with our estimates that about half the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; (clothing) amount of vitamin D, Caucasian Americans make at 40°N (&amp;lt;800 IU/day) can be made at 52°N (&amp;lt;400 IU/day) based on erythemally-weighted doses measured at the same latitude in the Netherlands.58 People at 52°N receive about half the annual erythemally-weighted UV dose that Americans get at ~40°N, and consequently would make about half the amount of vitamin D Americans make during any season of the year.

The epidemiology results and our calculated amounts of vitamin D/day produced by Americans (&amp;gt;21 yr) significantly differ from what the American Academy of Dermatology claims.42 They claim people can make &amp;quot;ample&amp;quot; vitamin D, (&amp;gt;1,000 IU/day) from &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; sun exposure, even if they diligently wear SPF 15 sunscreen. However, they did not convert the erythemally-weighted UV doses to previtamin D -weighted UV doses and they did not convert horizontal plane doses to full-cylinder or actual body doses; they also did not take age into account. In contrast to their claims, we find the majority of indoor-working adult Americans are not going outside enough all year to get adequate everyday sun exposure to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) they need. Only some &amp;quot;out-doorsy&amp;quot; indoor-working Caucasians can make optimal vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day) during the summer and some other skin types if they wear sporty clothing to work, take a 2—3 week vacation at latitudes &amp;lt;40°N (see Fig. 5), and do not wear sunscreens except on beach vacations. The only other people who can make enough vitamin D are some of the outdoor-working adult Americans (~5% of the population). The most serious situation occurs with seniors (60+ yr) who cannot even make the minimum amount of vitamin D (600—800 IU/day) all year even with a 3-week vacation. Furthermore, if anyone wears sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D (see in ref. 44).

We also find that almost all indoor-working adult Americans are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures all year to make optimal amounts of vitamin D (&amp;gt;1,200 IU/day).53,59-61 Some people with skin type II and some men with skin types III and IV can make the optimal amounts of vitamin D3 during the summer if they also take a 2—3 wk vacation (Fig. 5). However, if they wear sunscreen of SPF &amp;gt;15, they will make virtually no vitamin D all year including during the summer (see in ref. 44). Thus, as found in the NHANES III study, Caucasian adult Americans with Fitzpatrick skin type II, and especially the darker skin types III, IV and V/VI, are not getting adequate everyday UV exposures for most of the year to make the minimum amounts of vitamin D, to prevent deficiency. The situation would be much worse if they diligently wore sunscreens with SPF &amp;gt;15. The African-Americans have a similar situation from melanin protection, which may explain the disparity in health found between whites and blacks.62 Furthermore, neither diet nor supplements correct this situation.63-65 In fact, 83% of Australian dermatologists, who advise people to take vitamin D supplements rather than get more UV exposure, have insufficient blood levels of 25(OH) D.66 Because the UV doses of indoor-working people around the world are similar to ours at similar latitudes (25—50°N),58 vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml) and insufficiency (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L or 30 ng/ml) is also found around the world, especially at higher latitudes (&amp;gt;50°N) and in countries that do not fortify foods.63 As a result, vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem with serious health consequences,67 which occurs from too little sun exposure.

Note that senior&amp;#39;s &amp;gt;70 yr might only make about half the amount shown in the figure.

However, too much sun exposure can result in skin cancer, which is also a potentially serious health consequence. Paradoxically, while intermittent UVB sunburns increases indoor workers incidence of melanoma, regular, moderate UVB exposures keeps outdoor workers incidence of melanoma at the same level68,69 although they get 3—10 times more UV exposure as indoor workers get.58 Furthermore, regular moderate outdoor UV exposures increase the survival of melanoma patients.20 Thus, complete avoidance of or protection from all peak hour (10 A.M.—4 P.M.) UVB exposures and the diligent use of SPF &amp;gt;15 sunscreens may not only increase the incidence of a variety of adult diseases and the mortality from some internal cancers, but may also paradoxically be increasing the incidence of and mortality from melanoma.28 However, fair-skinned people who are prone to burning should wear sunscreens during beach vacations or if they are outside for a while in the strong midday summer sun (11 A.M.—3 P.M.) to prevent sunburn and the initiation of melanoma. Because the overall population probably should not increase their UV exposure and consequently their risk of getting skin cancers, and because most people do not take 

FBE x AF. Where VDD is the &amp;quot;Vitamin D Dose&amp;quot; or the person&amp;#39;s standard erythemally-weighted, average seasonal solar UV dose in SED/day at either 45°N or 35°N multiplied by its corresponding ASCF48 to convert it to a standard vitamin D dose (SVD), and then multiplied by its corresponding GCF.49 The later step converts it from a horizontal plane dose to a person&amp;#39;s body dose. The ASCF for each season in the northern (45°N) and Southern (35°N) US are 1.034 and 1.104 for summer, 0.879 and 1.029 for fall, 0.565 and 0.842 for winter, and 0.9 and 1.049 for spring, respectively.48 The GCF conversion factors in the northern (45°N) US are 0.434 for clear skies during the summer and spring, and 0.508 for clear skies during the winter and fall. The GCF conversion factors in the Southern (35°N) US are 0.417 for clear skies during the summer and spring and 0.484 for clear skies during the winter and fall.49 Note here that although the typical effect of cloud cover is a slight increase (&amp;lt;3%) in the average GCF, it can reduce UVB radiation drastically (up to ~50%).58 FBE is the fraction body exposed (described below), and AF is the age factor (described below and see Fig. 1 ).
The amount of vitamin D adults make

The average amount of vitamin D3 made by indoor-working adults every day during the summer without taking a summer vacation compared to the amount made by indoor-working adults of different ages and skin types if they take a 1-, 2- or 3-week &amp;quot;mixed&amp;quot; summer vacation at latitude ~40°N in the continental US. The dashed lines indicate the recommended IU/ day of vitamin D for people under (600 IU/day) and people over 70 yr (800 IU/day). A mixed summer vacation is the average of four types of vacations: beach, country, sightseeing and home; (A) skin types II and III and (B) skin types IV and V.
supplements on a regular basis, the best approach for maintaining healthy blood levels of 25(OH)D may be to supplement foods and drinks.

!!Materials and Methods
We give the details of these calculations in Godar et al.44 so that only the changes needed for the adult calculations are included below. We obtained the outdoor solar doses every season of the year for indoor-working adults (~95% population) from reference 46.

The equation for calculating the amount of vitamin D produced by people from an average daily, erythemally-weighted UV exposure during each season of the year is: Vitamin D3 (IU)/day = VDD x (4,861 IU/SED for skin type II) x STF x from outdoor UV exposures will depend on how much skin they expose to the sun while they are outside or their Fraction Body Exposed (FBE), so that one needs to multiply the FBE by the amount made from a whole body exposure (4,861 IU/ SED).44 We get the best estimates of how much body area adult Americans expose during each season of the year using the &amp;quot;rule of nines,&amp;quot; originally developed to estimate burn areas.70 To make these estimates, we assumed most adults would expose their face (3.5%), the front half of their neck (1%) and the front and back of both their hands (5%) during all seasons of the year, including winter (FBE is 9.5%; long-sleeved shirts/blouses and long pants/skirts). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose their lower arms (6%) during the spring and fall (FBE is 15.5%). In addition to those body areas, we assumed most adults would also expose half of their upper arms (4%; short-sleeved shirts or tee shirts) and all of their lower legs (14%; knee-length shorts/skirts) during the entire summer (FBE is 33.5%). However, adults have to work during the summer, so that they tend to expose only about 9.5—15.5% of their body (face, neck, hands and sometimes their lower arms) during their workweek. Thus, the amounts made during the summer are closer to half the values shown in the figures. For the children and adult body percentages exposed during each season see Table 1 of reference 44. The FBE is the percent body area exposed divided by 100%.
The final part of the calculation involves the ability of an adult to make vitamin D with age because it decreases with increasing age due to epidermal thinning.51 Because children (&amp;lt;22 yr) have the highest ability to make vitamin D , they have an age factor (AF) of unity compared to older adults; all other values are relative to theirs (Fig. 1): 0—20 yr (100% or 1.0), 22—40 yr (83% or 0.83), 41—59 yr (66% or 0.66) and 60+ yr (49% or 0.49). Note that adults over 70 yr can make as little as 25% of what children can make,67 so that our calculations are on the &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; side for the eldest adults (60+ yr).

One can do the sunscreen calculations by simply dividing the amount of vitamin D made without sunscreen (equation above) by the SPF factor.71 These numbers only apply to people who diligently wear sunscreens correctly, i.e., they generously apply them prior to going outdoors, covering their entire body and they reapply them every 2 hours.

To convert IU of vitamin D to ng/ml blood levels of 25(OH) D multiply by 0.01,60 and to convert 25-(OH)D ng/ml to 25(OH) D nmol/L multiply by 2.599,71 or multiply IU of vitamin D by 0.0385 to get 25-(OH)D nmol/L directly.

Basically, 100 IU of ingested vitamin D raises blood levels of 25(OH)D by 0.6—1 ng/ml.52,53

!!!!Vitamin D intake in young children with acute lower respiratory infection
Karen S Leis, J Dayre McNally, Matthew R Montgomery, Koravangattu Sankaran, Chandima Karunanayake, Alan M Rosenberg
Translational Pediatrics

Objective: To determine if vitamin D intake is associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children.

Methods: The vitamin D intakes of children younger than 5 years of age admitted to hospital with either bronchiolitis or pneumonia were compared to an unmatched control group of the same age without respiratory infection. 

Caregivers of 197 children completed a questionnaire collecting information on demographic variables, ALRI risk factors and diet.

Associations of ALRI with vitamin D intake and other ALRI risk factors were determined.

Results: The mean vitamin D intake of children with ALRI was 48 IU/kg/d compared to 60 IU/kg/d in the control group.

When controlling for age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, northern residence, breastfeeding, immunizations and smoking contact, children with a vitamin D intake of less than 80 IU/kg/d were greater than 4 times more likely to have ALRI compared to children with a vitamin D intake exceeding __80 IU/kg/day (OR 4.9__, CI: 1.5, 16.4).

Conclusions: A higher vitamin D intake than currently recommended might be needed to offer protection against diseases such as ALRI. 
Increased vitamin D supplementation could have important public health consequences, as bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common reasons for hospitalization in young children.

This article provides updated guidance to clinicians and health professionals on the role of vitamin D in health for adults. The guideline development process is outlined in Box 1.\n\nThe generic term “vitamin D” is generally applied to two molecules: cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is formed through the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (wavelength, 290 – 315 nm) on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. This process is the major determinant of vitamin D status, as most adults are unlikely to obtain more than 5% – 10% of their vitamin D requirement from dietary sources. Cholecalciferol is also the major form of supplemental vitamin D currently available in Australasia. The other form of vitamin D, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), is produced by UV irradiation of the plant sterol ergosterol. Few vitamin D supplements now contain this form. Both forms of vitamin D are transported to the liver and metabolised to 25-OHD. This is the major circulating form and the metabolite routinely used to assess overall vitamin D status. It is also likely to be the metabolite responsible for hypercalcaemia when vitamin D is given in excess.3\n\nFurther hydroxylation occurs in the kidney to form the biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D), also known as calcitriol. This compound promotes absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gut, contributes to extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis directly and through an interaction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), facilitates mineralisation of the skeleton, and is important for muscle function.4 In addition, almost every nucleated cell expresses the vitamin D receptor, and many extrarenal tissues have the capacity to make 1,25-(OH)2D. Thus, vitamin D can operate via classical endocrine pathways (renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D under the control of calcium concentration via PTH, or phosphate, with secretion into the bloodstream to increase intestinal calcium absorption), as well as through autocrine and paracrine pathways involving local synthesis and actions.\n`

The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the amount of UV radiation exposure that just causes faint redness of the skin (erythema). At low wavelengths, in the UVB range, the action spectrum for production of erythema is similar to that for production of vitamin D. However, erythema, but not vitamin D, can also be produced by higher-wavelength UVA radiation. This limits the usefulness of MED as an index of vitamin D dose.5 Nevertheless, there are experimental data indicating that exposure of around 15% of the body surface (arms and hands or equivalent) to one-third of an MED near the middle of the day will result in the production of about 1000 IU (25 ?g) of vitamin D. Achieving this exposure on most days should generally, though not always, be sufficient to maintain vitamin D levels in the body.5,6\n\nThe amount of sun exposure required to produce one-third of an MED depends on several factors (Box 2). Less vitamin D is synthesised in winter, particularly at latitudes further from the equator. There is minimal transmission of UVB radiation through normal window glass. Although sunscreens also markedly reduce transmission in the UVB range, these are often inadequately applied and may have little impact on vitamin D status.7 Lack of any skin exposure to sunlight, through confinement indoors or from clothing, is a more common issue. Short UV radiation exposures (of a few minutes) may be more efficient at producing vitamin D, as prolonged exposure to UV radiation results in the production of sterols that have little effect on mineral metabolism.4\n\nFor people with moderately fair skin, adequate vitamin D levels are likely to be maintained in summer by a walk outside with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon, on most days. In winter the task is more difficult but, depending on latitude, walking outside at lunchtime for 7–40 minutes, with as much bare skin exposed as feasible, on most days, is likely to be helpful although at very southern latitudes, relatively little vitamin D would be formed 5(Box 2). Care needs to be taken by people in the far north of Australia where the UV intensity remains moderate to high throughout the year. Given the high incidence of skin cancer in Australasia, sunscreens and other UV radiation avoidance measures should be used if exposure is likely to be prolonged when the UV index is 3 or above and/or there is a risk of skin damage, even for people with vitamin D deficiency. Some people are at particularly high risk of skin cancer, including those with a past history of skin cancer and those who are immunosuppressed.

If adequate levels are not achieved, consideration should be given to possible underlying gastrointestinal disorders, such as coeliac disease.

As low calcium intake and associated hyperparathyroidism increase the degradation of vitamin D compounds,67,69,84 a daily intake of 1000–1300 mg of calcium, preferably from calcium-rich foods, should be encouraged.\n\nAccording to the best evidence currently available, adequate serum 25-OHD levels of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer to allow for a seasonal decrease), along with recommended dietary calcium intakes and weight-bearing or muscle strengthening exercise, are required for optimal bone and muscle function, at least in older age groups. Although it is likely that serum 25-OHD levels that are somewhat higher than those required for musculoskeletal health play a small role in prevention of some disease states, there is evidence emerging of potential adverse effects of higher serum 25-OHD levels under some circumstances.

!Summary
*The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies, with the groups at greatest risk including housebound, community-dwelling older and/or disabled people, those in residential care, dark-skinned people (particularly those modestly dressed), and other people who regularly avoid sun exposure or work indoors.
*Most adults are unlikely to obtain more than 5 % – 10 % of their vitamin D requirement from dietary sources. The main source of vitamin D for people residing in Australia and New Zealand is exposure to sunlight.
*A serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer, to allow for seasonal decrease) is required for optimal musculoskeletal health.
*Although it is likely that higher serum 25-OHD levels play a role in the prevention of some disease states, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend higher targets.
*For moderately fair-skinned people, a walk with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon in summer, and with as much bare skin exposed as feasible for 7–40 minutes (depending on latitude) at noon in winter, on most days, is likely to be helpful in maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in the body.
*When sun exposure is minimal, vitamin D intake from dietary sources and supplementation of at least 600 IU (15 ?g) per day for people aged ? 70 years and 800 IU (20 ?g) per day for those aged &amp;gt; 70 years is recommended. People in high-risk groups may require higher doses.
*There is good evidence that vitamin D plus calcium supplementation effectively reduces fractures and falls in older men and women. 

Vitamin D status has emerged as a significant public health issue in Australia and New Zealand. An estimated 31% of adults in Australia have inadequate vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-OHD] level &amp;lt; 50 nmol/L), increasing to more than 50% in women during winter–spring and in people residing in southern states.1 This field of research is fast-moving, and it is timely to re-examine past recommendations 2 in light of the increasing number of medical conditions associated with low vitamin D status, and indications that higher levels of circulating serum 25-OHD may be required for optimal health. This article provides updated guidance to clinicians and health professionals on the role of vitamin D in health for adults. The guideline development process is outlined in Box 1.

The generic term “vitamin D” is generally applied to two molecules: cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is formed through the action of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (wavelength, 290 – 315 nm) on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin. This process is the major determinant of vitamin D status, as most adults are unlikely to obtain more than 5% – 10% of their vitamin D requirement from dietary sources. Cholecalciferol is also the major form of supplemental vitamin D currently available in Australasia. The other form of vitamin D, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), is produced by UV irradiation of the plant sterol ergosterol. Few vitamin D supplements now contain this form. Both forms of vitamin D are transported to the liver and metabolised to 25-OHD. This is the major circulating form and the metabolite routinely used to assess overall vitamin D status. It is also likely to be the metabolite responsible for hypercalcaemia when vitamin D is given in excess.3

Further hydroxylation occurs in the kidney to form the biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D), also known as calcitriol. This compound promotes absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gut, contributes to extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis directly and through an interaction with parathyroid hormone (PTH), facilitates mineralisation of the skeleton, and is important for muscle function.4 In addition, almost every nucleated cell expresses the vitamin D receptor, and many extrarenal tissues have the capacity to make 1,25-(OH)2D. Thus, vitamin D can operate via classical endocrine pathways (renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D under the control of calcium concentration via PTH, or phosphate, with secretion into the bloodstream to increase intestinal calcium absorption), as well as through autocrine and paracrine pathways involving local synthesis and actions.

!!Sunlight as a source of vitamin D
For most people, the main source of vitamin D is skin exposure to sunlight. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the amount of UV radiation exposure that just causes faint redness of the skin (erythema). At low wavelengths, in the UVB range, the action spectrum for production of erythema is similar to that for production of vitamin D. However, erythema, but not vitamin D, can also be produced by higher-wavelength UVA radiation. This limits the usefulness of MED as an index of vitamin D dose.5 Nevertheless, there are experimental data indicating that exposure of around 15% of the body surface (arms and hands or equivalent) to one-third of an MED near the middle of the day will result in the production of about 1000 IU (25 ?g) of vitamin D. Achieving this exposure on most days should generally, though not always, be sufficient to maintain vitamin D levels in the body.5,6

The amount of sun exposure required to produce one-third of an MED depends on several factors (Box 2). Less vitamin D is synthesised in winter, particularly at latitudes further from the equator. There is minimal transmission of UVB radiation through normal window glass. Although sunscreens also markedly reduce transmission in the UVB range, these are often inadequately applied and may have little impact on vitamin D status.7 Lack of any skin exposure to sunlight, through confinement indoors or from clothing, is a more common issue. Short UV radiation exposures (of a few minutes) may be more efficient at producing vitamin D, as prolonged exposure to UV radiation results in the production of sterols that have little effect on mineral metabolism.4

For people with moderately fair skin, adequate vitamin D levels are likely to be maintained in summer by a walk outside with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon, on most days. In winter the task is more difficult but, depending on latitude, walking outside at lunchtime for 7–40 minutes, with as much bare skin exposed as feasible, on most days, is likely to be helpful although at very southern latitudes, relatively little vitamin D would be formed 5(Box 2). Care needs to be taken by people in the far north of Australia where the UV intensity remains moderate to high throughout the year. Given the high incidence of skin cancer in Australasia, sunscreens and other UV radiation avoidance measures should be used if exposure is likely to be prolonged when the UV index is 3 or above and/or there is a risk of skin damage, even for people with vitamin D deficiency. Some people are at particularly high risk of skin cancer, including those with a past history of skin cancer and those who are immunosuppressed. Such people need more rigorous sun protection and should discuss with their medical practitioner whether supplements might be more appropriate than sun exposure to maintain vitamin D levels.

!!Groups at high risk of vitamin D deficiency
Adult groups at high risk of vitamin D deficiency are shown in Box 3. 
Although older people are an at-risk group for developing vitamin D deficiency, because they have less substrate (7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin) and lower production rates of vitamin D from high levels of UV radiation exposure,13 they synthesise similar amounts of vitamin D as younger people at normal levels of UV radiation exposure.14 
A major reason for vitamin D deficiency in older people is limited sun exposure.9

Vitamin D synthesis is reduced in those who have dark skin due to the presence of melanin, which absorbs UV radiation.7 
People with dark skin are likely to need sun exposures 3–6 times longer than the times shown in Box 2. 
Vitamin D synthesis is also reduced by clothing,7,15,16 and people who wear covering clothing for cultural or religious reasons are an at-risk group. 
The sun avoidance behaviour of fair-skinned people increases their risk of vitamin D deficiency.11,17 
Reduced sun exposure is also likely to contribute to increased risk of vitamin D deficiency in people with chronic illness and those confined indoors. 
There is some evidence that sun exposure and vitamin D status may have separate roles in the development of disease.18

!!Dietary sources of vitamin D
Vitamin D3 is found naturally in small quantities in a few foods, such as wild-caught fatty fish (eg, North Sea salmon, herring, mackerel). Liver, eggs and fortified foods such as margarine and some low-fat milk products also contain very small amounts of vitamin D3. In Australia, there is one specially supplemented milk product with 200 IU (5 ?g) of vitamin D per 250 mL serve, and some mushrooms that have been exposed to UV radiation provide 800 IU (20 ?g) of vitamin D2 per 100 g.4 However, for most people, dietary vitamin D intake is limited.

Although accurate, comprehensive data on the vitamin D content of foods in Australasia are not available, vitamin D intake from dietary sources is likely to be insufficient to meet requirements, as the average estimated daily dietary intake for adults is only between 80 and 120 IU (2–3 ?g).19 This is considerably lower than in other countries (eg, Canada and the United States, where average intake ranges between 120 and 240 IU [3–6 ?g] per day) where more extensive vitamin D fortification of the food supply is mandated or permitted.20 It is acknowledged that the current (2006) guidelines for recommended dietary intakes (ie, adequate intakes) of vitamin D in Australia and New Zealand21 __are out of date__. The recently revised recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for vitamin D in the US are 600 IU (15 ?g) for people aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 ?g) for those aged ? 71 years, with an upper limit (that includes a generous safety factor) of 4000 IU (100 ?g).22

Effect of vitamin D on mineral metabolism, bone health and muscle function
The most clearly established effects of vitamin D are to maintain calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and to optimise bone health and muscle function.23-25 The hormonal form, 1,25-(OH)2D, increases active intestinal calcium (and phosphate) absorption, which helps offset obligatory calcium losses from the kidneys, gut and skin. Calcium concentrations in blood are maintained within narrow limits, so if inadequate calcium is absorbed from dietary sources, bone resorption increases under the influence of PTH, to maintain circulating calcium levels. Severe vitamin D deficiency causes impaired bone mineralisation, resulting in rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. There is Level II evidence that optimal mineral metabolism, bone density and muscle function is achieved at serum 25-OHD concentrations of 50–60 nmol/L,23-26 with no consistent evidence that higher levels are beneficial. Although most of these studies have been in older people, there is some evidence of improvement in bone mineral content from vitamin D supplementation in children and adolescents aged between 1 month and 20 years with low vitamin D levels (&amp;lt; 35 nmol/L).27 Further, a recent histomorphometric study of 675 German adults showed increased osteoid (unmineralised bone matrix) in some people with 25-OHD concentrations &amp;lt; 75 nmol/L, suggesting that this may be an appropriate cut-off for optimal bone health.28

Vitamin D deficiency is an independent predictor of falls in older people, and circulating 25-OHD levels &amp;lt; 60–75 nmol/L have been associated with lower-extremity muscle weakness and impaired balance, and accelerated losses in muscle mass, strength and physical function.25,29 A recent meta-analysis indicated that a minimum serum 25-OHD level of 60 nmol/L is required to effectively reduce the rate of falls,30 although this analysis has been disputed.22 Most Level I evidence indicates that vitamin D (at daily doses of &amp;gt; 800 IU [20 ?g]) needs to be combined with adequate calcium (&amp;gt; 1000 mg per day), rather than vitamin D alone, to reduce the risk of falls and fractures; although there may be benefits with single therapies.30-34 Therefore, older people would be recommended to consume adequate (1000–1300 mg per day) but not excessive dietary intakes of calcium, together with maintaining adequate vitamin D status (within the 25-OHD range 50–60 nmol/L, allowing for seasonal variation), to reduce risk of falls and fracture. This recommendation is consistent with the recent review conducted by the US Institute of Medicine that recommends a minimum serum level of 50 nmol/L, which can be achieved by meeting the RDA for vitamin D.22,35

!!Relationship of serum 25-OHD levels to disease
A wide range of diseases have been associated with low levels of circulating serum 25-OHD,4,13 including autoimmune diseases,36,37 cardiovascular and metabolic diseases,4,38-40 some cancers,41,42 microbial and respiratory diseases,4,43-45 and some neurological and mental health conditions 46-48 including schizophrenia,49 as well as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality 50,51 (Box 4). Most of these studies were observational and did not adjust for important confounders. While there are studies in animal models that support the epidemiological evidence, and plausible mechanisms to explain the effects of vitamin D, there are very few randomised controlled trials (RCTs), most of which have marked limitations, on which to base recommendations.39,41,44 Accordingly, proposals that recommend serum 25-OHD levels of 75–80 nmol/L or higher 56 are not supported by a significant amount of data from RCTs.22

Other epidemiological studies have recently provided Level III evidence of U-shaped exposure–risk relationships between serum 25-OHD levels and disease outcomes (ie, increased risk at both low [&amp;lt; 30 nmol/L] and high [&amp;gt; 75 or &amp;gt; 125 nmol/L] concentrations) for mortality,57,58 schizophrenia,49 prostate cancer,59 and frailty in women.60 These U-shaped curves may in part reflect a mixture of common genetic variants,61 but further RCTs are needed.

!!Other factors affecting vitamin D status
Vitamin D enters adipose tissue and may not be readily released, unless there is fat breakdown, so obesity results in lower vitamin D levels after receipt of oral or cutaneously synthesised vitamin D.12 Physical activity is a predictor of vitamin D status,62 which could be due to alteration in the storage and mobilisation of vitamin D in fat 63 or to greater exposure to sunlight when exercising. Polymorphisms in the genes for vitamin D-binding protein, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (which affects the amount of substrate 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin) and 25-hydroxylase may contribute as much to variation in 25-OHD levels as the summer–winter difference.61,64 The half-life of 25-OHD is long and, for reasons that are not entirely known, varies between 15 and 50 days.65 Some medications, such as cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, including some anticonvulsants, accelerate degradation of vitamin D compounds.66

One important factor is calcium intake, with low intakes of calcium or high levels of PTH (either primary or secondary) linked to accelerated degradation of 25-OHD and a shorter half-life.67 In contrast, increased dietary calcium intake leads to higher 25-OHD concentrations.68,69 Low calcium absorption may be the reason why people with malabsorption, or who undergo gastrectomy or related procedures,69 have reduced 25-OHD levels, as there is no evidence for clinically significant enterohepatic circulation of vitamin D compounds.70

!!Toxicity
The main concerns with excessive vitamin D levels are hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D toxicity can be caused by excess oral intake through supplementation, but not by prolonged exposure of the skin to sunlight, which produces 25-OHD values in the range 150–200 nmol/L.4,5,71 Hypercalcaemia is not seen until serum 25-OHD levels reach 220 nmol/L and is generally not reported until levels reach 500 nmol/L.71 There is no evidence of toxicity, based on blood calcium concentrations, at vitamin D doses up to 5000 IU per day or 50 000 IU per month.72-74

However, adverse effects can probably no longer be defined solely by hypercalcaemia, as a large RCT in older Australian women found that a single annual dose of 500 000 IU vitamin D3 for 3–5 years resulted in a 15% increase in falls and 26% increase in fractures.75 The increased risk of falls was pronounced in the first 3 months after taking the dose, and fracture risk also tended to be higher during this 3-month post-dose period, when serum 25-OHD levels would have been highest. Annual megadose vitamin D is thus not recommended, although a 5-year community study providing 100 000 IU (2500 ?g) of oral vitamin D3 every 4 months to older people did show benefits for fracture reduction.76 Furthermore, intramuscular administration of vitamin D (100 000 or 150 000 IU) may be appropriate in patients with malabsorption, although intramuscular preparations are not readily available in Australia. Administration of vitamin D is contraindicated in most cases of hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D treatment is not contraindicated in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency.77 Cod liver oil, which can be used for vitamin D supplementation, also contains vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses.

!!Serum 25-OHD status and target values
Based on our review of the available evidence, vitamin D status can be defined according to the following levels of serum 25-OHD:

!!Vitamin D adequacy: ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (level may need to be 10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer, to allow for seasonal decrease).
*Mild vitamin D deficiency: 30–49 nmol/L
*Moderate vitamin deficiency: 12.5–29 nmol/L
*Severe vitamin D deficiency: &amp;lt; 12.5 nmol/L
On the basis of the evidence discussed above, a target level for vitamin D adequacy for mineral homeostasis, bone health and muscle function would seem to be &amp;gt; 50 or 60 nmol/L,22,24 although optimal values, even for bone and muscle health, are not clear. Ideally, the target value should allow for a decrease in vitamin D levels during winter.17 An international consensus statement recently agreed on a 25-OHD serum concentration range between 50 and 62.5 nmol/L (20–25 ng/mL) to prevent adverse musculoskeletal outcomes, including falls and fractures.78 The target serum level for prevention of other diseases is not clear but may be higher, in the range of 75–80 nmol/L (30–32 ng/mL). However, there is currently limited high-level evidence to support these higher 25-OHD serum levels.56

Clinicians, researchers and policymakers should be aware of the imprecision of current 25-OHD testing, and exercise caution when interpreting results in clinical practice. Although the performance of radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked assays is acceptable, the bias and imprecision of many automated methods may be problematic at the lower, clinically and analytically important range (&amp;lt; 50 nmol/L) of the assay. While adoption and alignment of assays to the National Institute of Standards and Technology reference material should reduce bias,79 imprecision will remain problematic. Consequently, some laboratories are using more exacting methods of analysis, such as liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.79 All Australian and New Zealand laboratories offering 25-OHD testing are required to be enrolled in external proficiency programs (such as the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme [DEQAS]), which allow each laboratory to monitor its performance compared with its peers.

!!Supplemental vitamin D doses required to achieve targets
Some studies have shown that with supplemental vitamin D3, 25-OHD levels reach a plateau at about 8 weeks, after rising by, on average, about 0.7 nmol/L for each 40 IU (1 ?g) per day of supplemental vitamin D3 (ie, an increase of about 17 nmol/L for each 1000 IU [25 ?g] per day).73,80 However, at any given dose there is considerable individual variation in the plateau level achieved. Although the increment is negatively correlated to the baseline 25-OHD concentration, it is not significantly affected by race, sex or age.80,81 Obesity, however, is associated with lower levels of 25-OHD and a reduced dose response to oral vitamin D or UV radiation.7,12 As it may take up to 2–5 months for serum levels of 25-OHD to plateau,80,82 retesting should not take place before 3 months.

There appears to be little difference in 25-OHD values whether the total amount of vitamin D is given as a daily, weekly or monthly dose, with no clear indication that one dosing schedule is more effective than another. Intermittent dosing may be more convenient in some settings, such as nursing homes,83 and may also achieve better long-term compliance.73 There is conflicting evidence about whether vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D2 in raising 25-OHD levels,84,85 but virtually all oral vitamin D supplements available in Australia and New Zealand are vitamin D3. There are currently no generally available, Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved parenteral preparations of vitamin D, although these might be helpful where ability to swallow, malabsorption or compliance are problems.

Recommendations for assessment and management of vitamin D deficiency are shown in Box 5. To treat moderate to severe deficiency, it would be reasonable to use 3000–5000 IU (75–125 ?g) of vitamin D per day for at least 6–12 weeks, although there are no long-term safety data for these doses. This will usually return serum 25-OHD levels to the target range, although smaller daily doses of 2000 IU might be expected to increase 25-OHD levels by 34 nmol/L, as noted earlier. As there is such an individual variation of response to vitamin D supplementation, 25-OHD levels should be checked after 3 months. If adequate levels are not achieved, consideration should be given to possible underlying gastrointestinal disorders, such as coeliac disease. Most patients whose 25-OHD levels have normalised will need ongoing treatment at a maintenance dose of around 1000–2000 IU (25–50 ?g) per day or equivalent.

For adults in disadvantaged communities at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as dark-skinned migrants from low socioeconomic backgrounds, a strong case could be made to routinely provide vitamin D supplements, at the same dose used to treat moderate to severe deficiency, as early as possible, without initially measuring serum 25-OHD levels. As low calcium intake and associated hyperparathyroidism increase the degradation of vitamin D compounds,67,69,84 a daily intake of 1000–1300 mg of calcium, preferably from calcium-rich foods, should be encouraged.

According to the best evidence currently available, adequate serum 25-OHD levels of ? 50 nmol/L at the end of winter (10–20 nmol/L higher at the end of summer to allow for a seasonal decrease), along with recommended dietary calcium intakes and weight-bearing or muscle strengthening exercise, are required for optimal bone and muscle function, at least in older age groups. Although it is likely that serum 25-OHD levels that are somewhat higher than those required for musculoskeletal health play a small role in prevention of some disease states, there is evidence emerging of potential adverse effects of higher serum 25-OHD levels under some circumstances. RCTs to test these hypotheses need to be undertaken before higher targets can be recommended with confidence.

!Box 1 – Position statement development process
This position statement was developed by a Working Group (joint Chairs, C N and R M) commissioned by the Australian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society (ANZBMS) and Osteoporosis Australia (OA). All members of the Working Group have published extensively in the field of vitamin D. Specific expertise includes: nutrition (C N, K S), brain (J M), endocrinology (P E, A H, R M), exercise (R D), measurement (M S) and sunlight exposure (R M).

The Working Group prepared an initial evidence-based draft statement that was circulated to senior colleagues in clinical bone research in Australia for comment. The statement was subsequently modified, and all members of the ANZBMS and Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) were notified by email that a draft statement had been posted on the ANZBMS website for widespread comment and feedback. Suggested revisions were incorporated with consensus from the Working Group. The medical and scientific affairs committees of the ANZBMS, OA and ESA reviewed the final manuscript. This edited version of the full position statement has been reviewed by all members of the Working Group and senior representatives of ANZBMS, OA and ESA.

!Box 5 – Recommendations for assessment and management of vitamin D deficiency states
!!High-risk groups
*Screening blood test for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level performed by a reputable laboratory participating in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS) proficiency program, followed by appropriate vitamin supplementation
*Supplementation without initial screening may be appropriate in some high-risk groups (eg, dark-skinned migrants, people in residential care establishments)
!!Minimum sun exposure to prevent deficiency
*For moderately fair-skinned people, a walk with arms exposed for 6–7 minutes mid morning or mid afternoon in summer, and with as much bare skin exposed as feasible for 7–40 minutes (depending on latitude) at noon in winter, on most days, is likely to be helpful in maintaining adequate vitamin D levels in the body
!!Vitamin D intake required from dietary sources and supplementation to prevent deficiency
*At least 600 IU (15 ?g) per day for those aged ? 70 years, and 800 IU (20 ?g) per day for those aged &amp;gt; 70 years 22
*Those in high-risk groups or with substantial sun avoidance may require higher doses
*Vitamin D supplementation of 1000 IU (25 ?g) per day, combined with adequate calcium intake, is required to reduce fracture risk in older people
!!Vitamin D supplementation required to treat moderate to severe deficiency
*3000–5000 IU (75–125 ?g) per day for at least 6–12 weeks, with a check on 25-OHD concentrations for most people after 3 months, 
+followed by ongoing treatment with a lower dose of around 1000–2000 IU per day 
+(eg, 3–5 × 1000 IU vitamin D3 capsules per day or 0.6–1 mL of 5000 IU/mL liquid vitamin D3 for 6–12 weeks, followed by 1 capsule of 1000 IU or 0.2 mL of 5000 IU/mL liquid per day) 
+and adequate calcium intake
*An alternative is 50 000 IU vitamin D3 (eg, Calciferol Strong, API Consumer Brands, New Zealand only), 1 tablet, once per month for 3–6 months 74*
*Most patients will need ongoing treatment with a lower dose (eg, 1000 IU per day or equivalent)
* Monthly dosing is similarly effective and apparently safe but takes 3–5 months for plateau 25-OHD levels to be reached.

Introduction: COPD patients may be at increased risk for vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency, but risk factors for deficiency among COPD patients have not been extensively reported.

Methods: Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured by liquid chromatography double mass spectrometry in subjects aged 40–76 years from Western Norway, including 433 COPD patients (GOLD stage II-IV) and 325 controls. Levels &amp;lt;20 ng/mL defined deficiency. Season, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), smoking, GOLD stage, exacerbation frequency, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), respiratory symptoms, depression (CES-D score?16), comorbidities (Charlson score), treatment for osteoporosis, use of inhaled steroids, and total white blood count were examined for associations with 25(OH)D in both linear and logistic regression models.

Results: COPD patients had an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to controls after adjustment for seasonality, age, smoking and BMI. 
Variables associated with lower 25(OH)D levels in COPD patients were 
*obesity ( = ?6.63), 
*current smoking ( = ?4.02), 
*GOLD stage III- IV ( = ?4.71, = ?5.64), and
* depression ( = ?3.29). 
Summertime decreased the risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR = 0.22).

Conclusion: COPD was associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, and important disease characteristics were significantly related to 25(OH)D levels.

!!COPD 4X more likely among former smokers having low vitamin D – April 2012

!!Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, oral health and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
J Clin Periodontol. 2012 Apr;39(4):350-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2012.01852.x. Epub 2012 Feb 1.

AIM: To evaluate the associations of serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels with periodontal health and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 193 COPD patients and 181 controls. 
Their periodontal status and lung function were examined, and serum 25(OH)D levels were measured.

RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in the COPD group than in the controls (32.1 versus 35.8 nmol/l; p = 0.002). 
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively correlated with lung function among non-smokers and negatively correlated with plaque index (PLI) among former smokers. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, season and smoking status, periodontal indexes were significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D concentrations (number of remaining teeth among all groups; probing depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding index, PLI and alveolar bone loss among COPD group). 

Lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with an increased risk of COPD among former smokers (__Odd ratio 4.11__; 95% confidence interval 1.47-11.5; p = 0.007) after adjustment for periodontal indexes and other variables.

CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly associated with poor periodontal health and an increased risk of COPD.

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and associated with dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The impact is unknown of correcting vitamin D deficiency on blood lipids, strong cardiovascular disease prognostic factors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lipids, we analyzed 4.06 million de-identified patient laboratory test results from September 2009 through February 2011.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
