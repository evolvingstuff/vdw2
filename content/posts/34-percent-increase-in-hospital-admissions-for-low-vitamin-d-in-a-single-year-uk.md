#### [Most supplements for (UK) children do not contain enough vitamin D](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/02/26/supplements-children-do-not-contain-enough-vitamin-d/) 2019

* "... 67 multivitamin products made by 24 different manufacturers were included in the study"

* Purchased from Asda, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Boots, Holland and Barrett, Lloyds Pharmacy and Superdrug

* "Only one multivitamin was suitable for use from birth and this supplied  **200 IU**  per day – around half the recommended amount"

* :For children >6 months, just 25 - 36 %t of the available multivitamins provided the recommended 400 IU per day of vitamin D, the experts said.:

* "The team also looked at the Government's  **Healthy Start**  scheme, which provides free multivitamins to low-income families, but these provide only **300 IU**  per day of vitamin D"
