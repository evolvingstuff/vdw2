This study points out the huge loss of income resulting from hospitilization, which is not covered by insurance

Analysis is primarily on 2700 adults aged 50-59 for all types of hospitalizations

Note: It does not seem to consider those who died in the hospital

* Prevent the hospitalization

* Reduce the stay in the hospital (and thus the deductables and co-pays)

* Improve the outcome ==> less likely to lose job
