#### The use of vitamin D for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases

As Vitamin D (VD) plays an essential role in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, this systematic review aimed to update the participation of this vitamin in the prevention or remission of these diseases. This review has included studies in MEDLINE-PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The authors have followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, twenty-two randomized clinical trials were selected. In all, 1,209 patients were included in this systematic review: 1034 received only VD and 175 received VD in combination with calcium. 

The average doses of VD supplementation were from oral 400 IU daily to 10,000 IU per kilogram of body weight. Single injection of 300,000 IU of VD was also used. Several studies have shown the crucial role that VD plays in the therapeutic approach of IBD due to its  **effects on the immune system** . It effectively decreased inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ (p<0.05) and provided a reduction in disease activity assessed through different scores such as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (p<0.05) and Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) (p<0.05). 

Unfortunately, the available clinical trials do not have standardization of doses and routes of administration.  **Existing meta-analyses are biased because they compare studies using different doses or treatments**  in combination with different drugs or supplements such as calcium. Even though VD has crucial effects on inflammatory processes, there is still a need for standardized studies to establish how the supplementation should be performed and the doses to be administered.
