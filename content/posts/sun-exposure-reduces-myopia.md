### [Seeing the Light: Why Sun Exposure May Be Good for Your Eyes](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/sunlight-myopia/) June 2011 Marks Daily Apple

Huge amount of information

Author wants to keep most of the information at his site

So, here are just a few items

Sunlight and circadian rhythm - (do not have bright light at night)

Kathryn Rose, points to the weak or inconsistent epidemiology that attempts to link time 

* spent on the computer, 

* watching television, 

* reading, and 

* studying 

to myopia. She suggests that the real problem is lack of sunlight.

## References (linked at his website)

* In Chinese school children, myopia progression was inversely correlated with outdoor activity.

* Near work (studying, reading) did not correlate with myopia progression, but American kids who played fewer sports outdoors had more myopia.

* In Taiwanese rural children, outdoor activities might be “an important protecting factor for myopia.”

* In teens from Singapore, outdoor activity appeared to protect against myopia progression.
