Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased fracture risk. The observational study aimed to investigate vitamin D status and supplementation in ambulatory patients. Only 20% of patients had optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels. Commonly recommended dosages were insufficient to achieve clinically relevant increase of 25(OH)D levels. Higher dosages were safe and effective under clinical practice conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse health outcome. The study aimed to investigate vitamin D status and supplementation in ambulatory patients. 

METHODS: Nine hundred seventy-five women and 188 men were evaluated for bone status from January 2008 to August 2008 within an observational study; 104 patients (n = 70 osteoporosis) received follow-up after 3 months. Dosage of vitamin D supplementation was documented and serum 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) determined. 

RESULTS: In all patients (age, 60.4 +/- 14.1 years), distribution of 25(OH)D was 56.3 +/- 22.3 nmol/L (normal range, 52-182 nmol/L) and PTH 53.8 +/- 67.5 ng/L (normal range, 11-43 ng/L). The proportion of patients with 25(OH)D < 25, 25 to <50, 50 to <75, >/=75 nmol/L was 7.5%, 33.3%, 38.9% and 20.2% in the total group and 20.1%, 38.5%, 30.8%, 10.6% at baseline in the follow-up group, respectively. After 3 months, 3.9% had still 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L; only 12.5% achieved 25(OH)D >/= 75 nmol/L. 

In osteoporosis patients, 25(OH)D increased more in those taking >/=1,500 (median, 3,000) IU vitamin D per day (33.1 +/- 14.7 nmol/L) compared with /=1,500 IU/day (-13.2 +/- 15.2 ng/L) compared with /= 75 nmol/L resulted in normalised PTH. 

CONCLUSION: Supplementation with higher vitamin D dosages (2,000-3,000 IU/day) is required to achieve a relevant increase of 25(OH)D and normalisation of PTH. DOI: 10.1007/s00198-010-1214-5      PMID: 20556359
