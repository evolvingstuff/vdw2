#### Vitamin D protects against diet-induced obesity by enhancing fatty acid oxidation

The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. Available online 21 June 2014

Prospective studies reported an inverse correlation between 25 hydroxy-vitamin D plasma levels and prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition, 25 hydroxy-vitamin D status may be a determinant of obesity onset. However, the causality between these observations is not yet established. We studied the preventive effect of vitamin D3 supplementation (15000 IU/kg of food for 10 weeks) on onset of obesity in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. 

We showed that the vitamin D3 supplementation limited weight gain induced by high-fat diet, which paralleled with an improvement of glucose homeostasis. The limitation of weight gain could further be explained by an increased of lipid oxidation, possibly due to an up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism, leading to increased energy expenditure. 

Altogether, these data show that vitamin D3  **regulates energy expenditure** , and suggest that vitamin D3 supplementation may represent a strategy of preventive nutrition to fight the onset of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

##### How much Vitamin D would this be for a human

It appears that the average human adult consumes 4 lbs of food per day

We assume the same amount of food consumed per body weight for humans and mice.

Then we can compute the vitamin D daily dose equivalent for a human

15,000 *4 / 2.5 =  **24,000 IU/day**
