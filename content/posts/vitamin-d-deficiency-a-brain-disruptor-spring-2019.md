 **Comment on 2 studies in Feb 2019** 

* :Vitamin D deficiency disrupts structural brain connectivity and harms learning and memory by destabilizing  **perineuronal nets**  (PNNs) that provide scaffolding for neurons, new research suggests."

* "PNNs are made of proteins and sugar molecules that form a strong, supportive mesh around certain neurons. In so doing, they stabilize the contacts these cells make with other neurons."
