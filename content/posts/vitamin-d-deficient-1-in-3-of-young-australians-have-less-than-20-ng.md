Background/Objectives

Vitamin D deficiency is a public health concern worldwide. Maintaining vitamin D sufficiency during growth periods is essential. We aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of vitamin D deficiency in Australian adolescents and young adults.

Subject/Methods

We used data from adolescents (12–17 years, n = 692) and young adults (18–24 years, n = 400) who participated in the nationally representative 2011–2013 Australian Health Survey. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured using a method certified to international standards, with prevalence reported for <50 (vitamin D deficiency), 50–<75, ≥75 and >125 nmol/L. Independent predictors of vitamin D deficiency were determined using a survey-weighted Poisson regression model.

Results

Overall, 17% of adolescents and 32% of young adults were vitamin D deficient. In models adjusted for sex, age, region of birth, socioeconomic status, BMI and season (and education, smoking status and physical activity in young adults only), the  **prevalence ratio (PR)**  for vitamin D deficiency was more than double in participants born outside Australia (adolescents: PR 2.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.59, 3.81; young adults: PR 2.12; 95% CI = 1.46, 3.07), and also varied by season (adolescents: spring vs summer PR 2.47; 95% CI = 1.22, 5.01 and winter vs summer PR 2.01; 95% CI = 1.03, 3.92; young adults:  **winter vs summer; PR 3.32** ; 95% CI = 1.69, 6.53). Other predictors of vitamin D deficiency were overweight compared with healthy weight (adolescents) and lower physical activity (young adults).

Conclusions

Strategies based on safe sun exposure and dietary approaches are needed to achieve and maintain adequate vitamin D status, particularly in young adults.
