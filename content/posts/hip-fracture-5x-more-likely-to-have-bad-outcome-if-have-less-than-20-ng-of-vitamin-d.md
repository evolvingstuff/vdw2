The aim was to assess prognostic value of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span> D) levels in older Chinese patients with hip fracture. From June, 2012 to February, 2014, older patients with hip fracture were included. Serum 25(OH) D levels were measured at admission. The functional evaluation at the time of discharge was performed by the Barthel Index. 

 **In the 66 patients with an unfavorable outcome, serum 25(OH) D levels were lower compared with those with a favorable outcome** . 

In multivariate analyses, there was an increased risk of unfavorable outcome associated with serum 25(OH) D levels ≤20 ng/ml (OR  **5.25** , 95% CI: 3.12-8.16). Our data supported an association between serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels at admission and short-term prognosis in Chinese older patients with hip fracture.
