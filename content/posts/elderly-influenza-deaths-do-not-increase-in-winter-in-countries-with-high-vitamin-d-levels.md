#### [FLU SEASON OR VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY SEASON](https://thepricklypilotswife.com/2018/01/flu-season-vitamin-d-deficiency-season/) Jan 2018

*  **"Did you know that there’s no seasonal difference in elderly deaths from influenza in the winter compared to summer in <span style="color:#F00;">Norway</span>? Did you also know that Norway has the highest Vitamin D levels in Europe – attributed to their high consumption of Cod Liver Oil? And that Great Britain has a low Vitamin D level and has TWICE as many elderly deaths due to influenza? I think I want my kids to take some cod liver"**
