### Limited exposure to ambient ultraviolet radiation and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: a systematic review.

Vitamin D can be synthesized following exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), ingested in the diet or provided through oral supplementation. The medical literature frequently states that humans obtain most of their vitamin D from sunshine and that UVR exposure is essential to maintain vitamin D levels. A systematic review was conducted to determine the requirement for UVR in maintaining adequate (> 50 nmol L-1 ) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels. Studies reporting serum 25(OH)D during situations of negligible UVR exposure were sought. 

Forty-one studies (from a search yielding 42 698 articles) with a total of 4211 healthy adults met the inclusion criteria, providing 56 datasets from different population groups. 

* Over 50% of subjects had > 50 nmol L-1 25(OH)D in 10 of 19 datasets reporting winter levels in areas with limited UVR. 

* In addition, > 50% of subjects had adequate 25(OH)D levels in 

> four of 12 datasets from polar regions during periods of negligible UVR, 

> one of nine datasets documenting clothing-related minimal UVR and 

> two of eight datasets detailing employment-related minimal UVR. 

The data demonstrate that many adults maintain adequate serum vitamin D levels despite negligible UVR exposure  **for several months** . However, we acknowledge that preceding UVR exposure leading to vitamin D storage and delayed release may account for this maintenance of adequate serum vitamin D levels. There remains a need for further research on whether UVR exposure is required for longer-term maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels.
