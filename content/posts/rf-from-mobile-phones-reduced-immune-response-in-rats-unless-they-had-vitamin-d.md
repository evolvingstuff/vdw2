| Group |  |

| II  | Vitamin D (1000 IU/kg/day) orally,  |
| III:  | Exposed to EMF 1h/day,  |
| IV:  | Exposed to EMF 2h/day,  |
| V:  | Exposed to EMF 1h/day and vitamin D (1000 IU/kg/day),  |
| VI:  | Exposed to EMF 2h/day and vitamin D (1000 IU/kg/day) |

There are considerable public concerns about the relationship between mobile phone radiations and human health. The present study assesses the effect of electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted from mobile phone on the immune system in rats and the possible protective role of vitamin D. Rats were randomly divided into six groups. Group I: control group, Group II: Received vitamin D (1000 IU/kg/day) orally, Group III: Exposed to EMF 1h/day, Group IV: Exposed to EMF 2h/day, Group V: Exposed to EMF 1h/day and received vitamin D (1000 IU/kg/day), Group VI: Exposed to EMF 2h/day and received vitamin D (1000 IU/kg/day). 

 **After 30 days of exposure time, 1h/day EMF exposure resulted in   
significant decrease in   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgE, IgM and IgG),   
&nbsp; &nbsp; total leukocyte,   
&nbsp; &nbsp; lymphocyte,   
&nbsp; &nbsp; eosinophil and basophil counts   
significant increase in   
&nbsp; &nbsp;neutrophil and monocyte counts.** 

These changes were more increased in 2h/day EMF exposed group.  **Vitamin D supplementation in EMF-exposed rats reversed these results when compared to EMF-exposed groups** . In contrast, 7, 14 and 21 days of EMF exposure produced non-significant difference in these parameters among all experimental groups. We concluded that exposure to mobile phone radiations compromises immune system of rats and vitamin D appears to have protective effect.

1. Around 2005 I read through the literature on rats and RF from mobile phones. There was something there, but I did not realize at the time that it might be connected with Vitamin D

1. I can understand why no vitamin D affect was noticed at days < 30 – Vitamin D levels take a month or so to reach a new level after supplementation

> If the rats had started a high level of vitamin D I suspect that the researchers would have seen a benefit of vitamin D in even as little as 7 days
