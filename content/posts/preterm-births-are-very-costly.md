* “In 2005 the estimated cost for preterm birth in the United States was $26.2 billion annually, above the average cost of term births.”

* “Preterm babies are <span>[also]</span> at higher risks for complications and health issues such as jaundice, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic lung disease.”

 **Average employer expenditures for newborn care** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/premature-lbw-costs.jpg" alt="image">

* "Costs per infant include all employer payments for newborn medical care during the  **first year of life** ."

* "Employers pay  **12 times as much in health care costs for premature/low birthweight**  (LBW) babies as for babies born without complications."

* "Each premature/LBW baby costs employers an additional $49,760 in newborn health care costs. 

> When maternal costs are added, employers and their employees pay $58,917 more when a baby is born prematurely."

* "With 1 in 9 babies born prematurely, employers spend more on that one premature baby than on the remaining eight babies combined."

* figures from Truven Health Analytics, Inc. Costs of Preterm Birth. Prepared for March of Dimes, 2013

 **Premature/low birth weight infants stay in hospital almost two seeks longer**

#### Economics of preterm birth reduction

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

 **Assumptions: additional $50,000 per premature birth, $100 for education & supplements per pregnancy**

Does not include additional [savings to infant](/posts/healthy-pregnancies-need-lots-of-vitamin-d)  beyond the first year

&nbsp; &nbsp;  such as reductions in Autism, MS, Respiratory Tract Infection, Asthma, Allergies

Does not include additional [savings to mother](/posts/healthy-pregnancies-need-lots-of-vitamin-d) 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  such as reduction in preeclampsia, miscarriage, gestational diabetes, depression

&nbsp; &nbsp; nor does it assign any costs for anguish of possible premie death, stillbirth, time off from work, job productivity

<!-- ~tc~ end ~/tc~ -->

Of course, the percentages cannot add up to 100%, which would = ZERO premature births

However, guess that the combination might result in a $3,500 average savings per birth

&nbsp; &nbsp; including reduction of preterm as well as other benefits to mother and child
