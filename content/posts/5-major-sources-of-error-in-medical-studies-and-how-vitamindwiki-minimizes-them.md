### It Ain't Necessarily So: Why Much of the Medical Literature Is Wrong

[Medscape Sept 2014](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/829866?src=wnl_edit_specol&uac=138704MX#2)

Nice study - here are the topics covered along with a few examples

1. Reverse Causality

2. The Play of Chance and the DICE Miracle

* Review of 45 highlighted studies in major medical journals. 

> 24% were never replicated, 

> 16% were contradicted by subsequent research,

> 16% were shown to have smaller effect sizes than originally reported. 

3. Bias: Coffee, Cellphones, and Chocolate

4. Confounding

5. Exaggerated Risk

* Example: risk ratio = 7% but odds ratio (which was reported) = 40%,

* Relative risk of drinking a cup of coffee and then getting heart attack 1.5X

> However, absolute risk  of heart attack after a cup of coffee is 1 in 2,000,000 cups

^ **A Dirty Dozen: Twelve P-Value Misconceptions (2008) is referenced by the article and is attached below** 

1 If P .05, the null hypothesis has only a 5% chance of being true.

2 A nonsignificant difference (eg, P>.05) means there is no difference between groups.

3 A statistically significant finding is clinically important.

4 Studies with P values on opposite sides of .05 are conflicting.

5 Studies with the same P value provide the same evidence against the null hypothesis.

6 P.05 means that we have observed data that would occur only 5% of the time under the null hypothesis.

7 P.05 and P <.05 mean the same thing.

8 P values are properly written as inequalities (eg, “P<.02” when P .015)

9 P.05 means that if you reject the null hypothesis, the probability of a type I error is only 5%.

10 With a P.05 threshold for significance, the chance of a type I error will be 5%.

11 You should use a one-sided P value when you don’t care about a result in one direction, or a difference in that direction is impossible.

12 A scientific conclusion or treatment policy should be based on whether or not the P value is significant^

 **VitaminDWiki conclusions minimize the above errors** 

* Emphasize RCT

* Minimize observational studies unless it was clear which came first

> If  3+ different studies have the same conclusion ==> FACT 

> If the studies disagree ==> lack of consensus (example lack of consensus: 5 say yes, 2 say no)

 **VitaminDWiki also does not report on studies which used too little vitamin D or for too short of time** 

* One study used 40 IU intervention and found no affect

* One study only gave Vitamin D for 1 month and found no affect

* One study had all patients with very low level of vitamin D, and found no difference in disease with 1 nanogram difference between the groups

* One study raised vitamin D levels by 10 ng and found no improvement: levels went to 10 ng to 20 ng – no where near to the 40 ng needed to make a difference
