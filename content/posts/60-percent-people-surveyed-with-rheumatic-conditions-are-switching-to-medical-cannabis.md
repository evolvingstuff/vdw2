#### [Cannabis Often Used as a Substitute for Traditional Medications](https://www.mdedge.com/rheumatology/article/271421/rheumatoid-arthritis/cannabis-often-used-substitute-traditional?ecd=WNL_EVE_241106_mdedge&uac=138704MX&sso=true) MdEdge

Overall, 62.5% reported substituting medical cannabis for certain medications, including

* NSAIDs (54.7%),

* opioids (48.6%),

* sleep aids (29.6%),

* muscle relaxants (25.2%),

* benzodiazepines (15.5%), and

* gabapentinoids (10.5%).

The most common reasons given for substituting medical cannabis were

* fewer side effects (39%),

* better symptom control (27%), and

* fewer adverse effects (12%).

Participants who substituted medical cannabis reported significant improvements in symptoms such as pain, sleep, joint stiffness, muscle spasms, and inflammation, and in overall health, compared with those who did not substitute it for medications.

The substitution group was more likely to use inhalation methods (smoking and vaporizing) than the nonsubstitution group; they also used medical cannabis more frequently and preferred products containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.

#### What is the definition of a rheumatic condition? - [Asked Perplexity AI Nov 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-what-of-states-is-medical-c-qY_d9BHlSNKarVqJBdAJQw)

A rheumatic condition is a complex group of disorders that primarily affects the musculoskeletal system.

Here's a comprehensive definition:

&nbsp; &nbsp; Rheumatic conditions are disorders that cause chronic, often intermittent pain affecting the joints, muscles, bones, and connective tissues

These conditions encompass more than 200 different diseases and can be inflammatory, autoimmune, or degenerative in nature

 **Key Characteristics** 

* They typically affect joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, and muscles

* Can cause inflammation, tissue degeneration, and autoimmune dysfunction

* May also impact internal organs and other body systems

* Often involve systemic inflammation and immune system dysregulation

 **Common Features** 

The primary symptoms of rheumatic conditions include:

* Joint pain, soreness, and tenderness

* Inflammation, swelling, and warmth in affected areas

* Morning stiffness and limited joint motion

* Chronic fatigue

* Symptoms that fluctuate with weather conditions

 **Scope** 

In the United States alone, rheumatic conditions affect approximately:

* 54 million adults

* 300,000 children

The term "rheumatism" itself comes from the Late Latin "rheumatismus" and Greek roots meaning "to suffer from a flux," historically referring to the belief that these conditions were caused by the flow of bodily fluids into joints
