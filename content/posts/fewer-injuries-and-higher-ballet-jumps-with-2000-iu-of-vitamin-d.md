Objectives: Athletes who train indoors during the winter months exhibit low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations due to a lack of sunlight exposure. This has been linked to impaired exercise performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of oral vitamin D3 supplementation on selected physical fitness and injury parameters in elite ballet dancers.

Design Controlled prospective study.

Methods 24 elite classical ballet dancers (intervention n = 17; control n = 7) participated in a controlled 4-month oral supplementation of vitamin D3 (2000 IU per day). Isometric muscular strength and vertical jump height were measured pre and post intervention. Injury occurrence during the intervention period was also recorded by the in-house medical team. Repeated measures ANOVA and Mann–Whitney-U statistical tests were used and significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.

Results Significant increases were noted for the intervention group for 

* isometric strength (18.7%, p < 0.01) and 

* vertical jump (7.1%, p < 0.01). 

The intervention group also sustained significantly less injuries than the controls during the study period (p < 0.01).

Conclusions Oral supplementation of vitamin D3 during the winter months has beneficial effects on muscular performance and injury occurrence in elite ballet dancers.
