Bivalent vaccine boosters were used widely during 2022-23, but the outbreaks persisted. Despite this, hospitalizations, mortality, and outbreaks involving dominant mutants like Alpha and Delta increased during winters when the population&rsquo;s vitamin D levels were at their lowest.</p><p>Notably, 75% of human immune cell/system functions, including post-vaccination adaptive immunity, rely on adequate <strong>circulatory vitamin D levels</strong> . Consequently, hypovitaminosis compromises innate and adaptive immune responses, heightening susceptibility to infections and complications. COVID-19 vaccines primarily target SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins, thus offering limited protection through antibodies. mRNA vaccines, such as those for COVID-19, fail to generate secretory/mucosal immunity-like IgG responses, rendering them ineffective in halting viral spread. Additionally, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 binding domain reduce immune recognition by vaccine-derived antibodies, leading to immune evasion by mutant viruses like Omicron variants. Meanwhile, the repeated administration of bivalent boosters intended to enhance efficacy resulted in the immunoparesis of recipients. As a result, relying solely on vaccines for outbreak prevention became less effective. Dominant variants exhibit increased affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor-2, enhancing infectivity but reducing virulence. Meanwhile, spike protein-related viral mutations do not impact the potency of widely available, repurposed early therapies, like vitamin D and ivermectin. With the re-emergence of COVID-19 and impending coronaviral pandemics, regulators and health organizations should proactively consider approval and strategic use of cost-effective adjunct therapies mentioned above to counter the loss of vaccine efficacy against emerging variants and novel coronaviruses and eliminate serious adverse effects. Timely implementation of these strategies could reduce morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs and provide a rational approach to address future epidemics and pandemics. This perspective critically reviews relevant literature, providing insights, justifications, and viewpoints into how the scientific community and health authorities can leverage this knowledge cost-effectively.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/1-s2.0-s2405844024107220-main-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=10-related-studies-in-vitamindwiki>10 related studies in VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/excess-death-rates-in-high-vaccinated-countries-exceeded-covid-death-rates-by-34-x-in-2023>Excess death rates in high-vaccinated countries exceeded COVID death rates by 3.4 X in 2023 - May 2024</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/multiple-covid-vaccinations-might-increase-cancer-incidence-many-studies style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Multiple COVID vaccinations might increase Cancer Incidence - many studies">Multiple COVID vaccinations might increase Cancer Incidence - many studies</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/vaccines-increased-your-risk-of-dying-of-covid-in-nz-official-data>Vaccines increased your risk of dying of COVID in NZ - official data - Feb 2024</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/covid-infections-and-vaccinations-decrease-vitamin-d-many-studies style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: COVID infections and vaccinations decrease Vitamin D – many studies">COVID infections and vaccinations decrease Vitamin D – many studies</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/covid-vaccination-problems-1000-x-worse-than-thalidomide style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: COVID vaccination problems 1000 X worse than Thalidomide - Dec 2023">COVID vaccination problems 1000 X worse than Thalidomide - Dec 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/hospital-utilization-australia-nsw-1415-vaccinated-0-unvaccinated style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Hospital utilization Australia (NSW) 1415 Vaccinated, 0 unvaccinated - Dec 2022">Hospital utilization Australia (NSW) 1415 Vaccinated, 0 unvaccinated - Dec 2022</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/excess-deaths-in-34-countries-probably-due-to-covid-vaccination-preprint style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Excess deaths in 34 countries (probably due to COVID vaccination) – preprint Aug 2023">Excess deaths in 34 countries (probably due to COVID vaccination) – preprint Aug 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/prevent-a-covid-death-9-dollars-of-vitamin-d-or-900000-dollars-of-vaccine style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Prevent a COVID death: 9 dollars of Vitamin D or 900,000 dollars of vaccine - Aug 2023">Prevent a COVID death: 9 dollars of Vitamin D or 900,000 dollars of vaccine - Aug 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/problems-with-vaccine-use-during-a-pandemic-dr-bossche-2021-2023 style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Problems with vaccine use during a pandemic - Dr. Bossche 2021 - 2023">Problems with vaccine use during a pandemic - Dr. Bossche 2021 - 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/more-covid-vaccinations-more-infections-cleveland-clinic style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: More COVID vaccinations, more infections - Cleveland Clinic - Dec 2022">More COVID vaccinations, more infections - Cleveland Clinic - Dec 2022</a></p></li></ul></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382322"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382322",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382322"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382322"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382322"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382322"></script></body></html>
