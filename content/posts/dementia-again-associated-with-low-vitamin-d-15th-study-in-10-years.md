##### Dementia 40 percent less-likely in seniors supplementing with Vitamin D - VitaminDWiki summary

Introduction: Despite the association of vitamin D deficiency with incident dementia, the role of supplementation is unclear. We prospectively explored associations between vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia in 12,388 dementia-free persons from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center.

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="700">

Methods: Baseline exposure to vitamin D was considered D+; no exposure prior to dementia onset was considered D-. Kaplan-Meier curves compared dementiafree survival between groups. Cox models assessed dementia incidence rates across groups, adjusted for age, sex, education, race, cognitive diagnosis, depression, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) z4. Sensitivity analyses examined incidence rates for each vitamin D formulation. Potential interactions between exposure and model covariates were explored.

Results: Across all formulations, vitamin D exposure was associated with significantly longer dementia-free survival and lower dementia incidence rate than no exposure (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.55-0.65). The effect of vitamin D on incidence rate differed significantly across the strata of sex, cognitive status, and APOE z4 status.

Discussion: Vitamin D may be a potential agent for dementia prevention.
