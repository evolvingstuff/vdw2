Glob J Health Sci. 2012 Nov 11;5(1):107-11. [doi: 10.5539/gjhs.v5n1p107.](https://doi.org/10.5539/gjhs.v5n1p107.)

BACKGROUNDS: Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, including Iran. It has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency is associated with non-specific musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this study is evaluation of the association of musculoskeletal pain with vitamin D deficiency and the response of the patients to vitamin D supplementation. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty two adult patients with chief complaint of musculoskeletal pain were enrolled in the study. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, Calcium, Phosphate, Alkaline Phosphatase and PTH were determined. If there was vitamin D deficiency, oral vitamin D supplementation was given. Assessment of pain and its response to therapy was carried out using Visual assessment score (VAS). SPSS software version 15.0 was used for statistical analyses. 

FINDINGS: Most of the patients (95.4%) had vitamin D deficiency. 

Pain in 53 patients  **(85.5%)**  with responded to the proposed treatment. In responder group post treatment vitamin D concentration was significantly higher than non responder group (60.6±27.6and 39.2±9.6 nmol/l respectively, p&lt;0.01) pretreatment vitamin D and minerals concentrations and pain characteristics did not have significant differences in responder and non responder group.

CONCLUSION:  **Treatment with vitamin D can relieve the pain in majority of the patients with vitamin D deficiency.**  Lack of response can be due to insufficient increase in serum vitamin D concentration.  Reassessment of serum 25(OH)D concentration is recommended in nonresponsive patients.
