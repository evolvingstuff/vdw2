Background Vitamin D deficiency is common in the general public and athletic populations and may impair skeletal muscle function. We therefore assessed the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D concentrations and physical performance.

Methods 30 club-level athletes were block randomised (using baseline 25<span>[OH]</span>D concentrations) into one of three groups receiving either a placebo (PLB), 20 000 or 40 000 IU/week oral vitamin D3 for 12 weeks. Serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D and muscle function (1-RM bench press and leg press and vertical jump height) were measured presupplementation, 6 and 12 weeks postsupplementation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined in accordance with the US Institute of Medicine guideline (<50 nmol/l).

Results 57% of the subject population were vitamin D deficient at baseline (mean±SD value 51±24 nmol/l). Following 6 and 12 weeks supplementation with 20 000 IU (79±14 and 85±10 nmol/l, respectively) or 40 000 IU vitamin D3 (98±14 and 91±24 nmol/l, respectively), serum vitamin D concentrations increased in all participants, with every individual achieving concentrations greater than 50 nmol/l. In contrast, vitamin D concentration in the PLB group decreased at 6 and 12 weeks (37±18 and 41±22 nmol/l, respectively). Increasing serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D had no significant effect on any physical performance parameter (p>0.05).

Conclusions Both 20 000 and 40 000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation over a 6-week period elevates serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D concentrations above 50 nmol/l, but neither dose given for 12 weeks improved our chosen measures of physical performance.

## Summary and comment by VitaminDWiki

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Initial  | 12 weeks |
| Placebo | 20 ng | 16 ng |
| 2900 IU | 20 ng  | 34 ng |
| 5700 IU  | 20 ng | 36 ng |

### The athletes needed one of more of the following

1. more vitamin D - to get to > 40 ng

1. to test for measures other than strength

> endurance, muscle reaction time, reduced injuries, faster injury recovery time, etc. have all been found to be improved by vitamin D
