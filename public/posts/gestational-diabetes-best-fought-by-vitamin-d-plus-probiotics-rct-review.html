#### Advancements in Nutritional Strategies for Gestational Diabetes Management: A Systematic Review of Recent Evidence

J Clin Med . 2023 Dec 20;13(1):37. [doi: 10.3390/jcm13010037.](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13010037.)

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as hyperglycaemia first detected at any time during pregnancy with values lower than those determined by the WHO for diabetes diagnosis in adults. This pathology, with a worldwide prevalence of 13.4%, causes significant maternal and foetal risks. The first line of treatment consists of maintaining normo-glycaemia through an adequate diet and lifestyle changes. The aim is to synthesize the scientific evidence updating the nutritional recommendations for the effective management of GDM. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. 

Randomized clinical trials published within the last five years and providing information on nutritional recommendations to achieve an effective management of gestational diabetes were selected. The databases searched were PubMed, the WOS Core Collection, SCOPUS, and CINAHL, using the MeSH terms: &quot;Diabetes, Gestational&quot;; &quot;Nutrition Assessment (nutrition*)&quot;; &quot;Diet&quot;; &quot;Eating&quot;; and &quot;Food&quot;; with the Boolean operators &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot;. The PEDro scale (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) was used to assess the scientific quality of the studies, with a mean score of 8.9, indicating an average good scientific quality. 

Results: A total of 809 papers were collected, of which, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria,  **14 randomized clinical trials were selected** . Probiotic supplementation and co-supplementation with vitamin D have been found to be the most beneficial options for both mothers with GDM and neonates, but the most effective regimens are not known. 

Diets enriched with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and oat bran, as well as some recommendations focused on carbohydrates also seem effective, as well as diets designed for this group of women with GDM such as &quot;CHOICE&quot;. 

Conclusions: Although there are numerous proposals that have been published in recent years focused on the diet of women with GDM in order to improve their results and those of their children, it is the supplementation with probiotics and the co-supplementation with vitamin D that is most agreed upon as beneficial; however, more research is needed into which protocols are most effective. Other proposals that could also be beneficial should be further studied.

!!!!Advancements in Nutritional Strategies for Gestational Diabetes Management: A Systematic Review of Recent Evidence
J Clin Med . 2023 Dec 20;13(1):37. doi: 10.3390/jcm13010037.
Juan Carlos Sánchez-García 1 2, Ines Saraceno López-Palop 2, Beatriz Piqueras-Sola 1 3, Jonathan Cortés-Martín 1 2, Elena Mellado-García 1 4, Inmaculada Muñóz Sánchez 5, Raquel Rodríguez-Blanque 1 2 6

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as hyperglycaemia first detected at any time during pregnancy with values lower than those determined by the WHO for diabetes diagnosis in adults. This pathology, with a worldwide prevalence of 13.4%, causes significant maternal and foetal risks. The first line of treatment consists of maintaining normo-glycaemia through an adequate diet and lifestyle changes. The aim is to synthesize the scientific evidence updating the nutritional recommendations for the effective management of GDM. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. 
Randomized clinical trials published within the last five years and providing information on nutritional recommendations to achieve an effective management of gestational diabetes were selected. The databases searched were PubMed, the WOS Core Collection, SCOPUS, and CINAHL, using the MeSH terms: &quot;Diabetes, Gestational&quot;; &quot;Nutrition Assessment (nutrition*)&quot;; &quot;Diet&quot;; &quot;Eating&quot;; and &quot;Food&quot;; with the Boolean operators &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot;. The PEDro scale (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) was used to assess the scientific quality of the studies, with a mean score of 8.9, indicating an average good scientific quality. 

Results: A total of 809 papers were collected, of which, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, __14 randomized clinical trials were selected__. Probiotic supplementation and co-supplementation with vitamin D have been found to be the most beneficial options for both mothers with GDM and neonates, but the most effective regimens are not known. 
Diets enriched with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and oat bran, as well as some recommendations focused on carbohydrates also seem effective, as well as diets designed for this group of women with GDM such as &quot;CHOICE&quot;. 

Conclusions: Although there are numerous proposals that have been published in recent years focused on the diet of women with GDM in order to improve their results and those of their children, it is the supplementation with probiotics and the co-supplementation with vitamin D that is most agreed upon as beneficial; however, more research is needed into which protocols are most effective. Other proposals that could also be beneficial should be further studied.
