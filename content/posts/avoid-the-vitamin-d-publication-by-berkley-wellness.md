# DO NOT BUY IT

I did, and will be asking for a refund

# Here are just a few of the huge number of problems

(not bothering to provide links to the correct material on the VitaminDWiki)

Author considers 20 ng/ml be to good

Time in the sun 5-20 minutes twice a week on face, arms, and legs

No comment about more needed by elderly, dark skinned

Food: does not distinguish farmed from wild salmon

Considers D2 to be acceptable Mushrooms are great

No apparent mention of co-factors

Pregnancy – seems to need more than 400 IU

Vitamin D supplements (at 400 IU) did not relieve arthritis pain

Vitamin D supplements (at 400 IU) did not prevent breast cancer

Vitamin D supplements (at 400 IU) did not prevent colon cancer

Vitamin D supplements (at 400 IU) DID prevent skin cancer – but study was too small

Vitamin D supplements (at 3000 IU average)  did not stop COPD

Systematic reviews found no evidence that Cognition helped by vitamin D – again far too low 

Vitamin D supplements (at 800 IU) did not stop depression

Vitamin D supplements (at 800 IU) did not stop falls by the elderly

Vitamin D supplements (at 400 IU) did not reduce risk of heart problems

Vitamin D2 (did not state how much) given annually did not help the heart

Vitamin D supplements (at 400 IU) did not reduce risk of bone fractures

Bottom line: middle ground take 800 to 1,000 IU per day
