#### Vitamin D and assisted reproduction: should vitamin D be routinely screened and repleted prior to ART? A systematic review - 2014

Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics December 2014

Purpose

To review the current literature regarding the role of vitamin D status in pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) and to assess cost-effectiveness of routine vitamin D deficiency screening and repletion prior to initiation of ART.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed. Relevant study outcomes were compared among the selected studies. A cost-benefit analysis was performed using a decision tree mathematical model with sensitivity analyses from the perspective of direct societal cost. Published data were used to estimate probabilities and costs in 2014 US dollars.

Results

Thirty-four articles were retrieved, of which eight met inclusion criteria. One study demonstrated a negative relationship between vitamin D status and ART outcomes, while two studies showed no association. The remaining five studies concluded that ART outcomes improved after vitamin D repletion.

Conclusion

The majority of reviewed studies reported a decrement in ART outcomes in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Cost-benefit analyses suggested that screening and supplementing vitamin D prior to ART  **might be cost effective** , but further evidence is needed. Given the absence of Level I evidence regarding vitamin D status and ART outcomes, full endorsement of routine vitamin D screening and supplementation prior to ART is premature.

 **Capsule** 

Vitamin D has been shown to play important roles in reproduction and vitamin D deficiency is a prevalent condition. A systematic review of vitamin D and ART outcomes yielded five studies that reported ART outcomes improved after vitamin D repletion, two studies found no association, and one study reported a negative association. Currently, Level I evidence is insufficient and a recommendation for routine vitamin D screening and supplementation prior to ART cannot be supported. There is a pressing need for additional studies of vitamin D replacement in this clinical scenario.

#### ART helped by Vitamin D: 2 studies say yes, 1 study says no - May 2014

 **Vitamin D and assisted reproduction technologies: current concepts.** 

Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2014 May 31;12:47. [doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-12-47.](https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7827-12-47.)

Accumulating evidence from animal and human studies suggests that vitamin D is involved in many functions of the human reproductive system in both genders, but no comprehensive analysis of the potential relationship between vitamin D status and Assisted Reproduction Technologies (ART) outcomes is currently available. On this basis, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to perform an in-depth evaluation of clinical studies assessing whether vitamin D status of patients undergoing ART could be related to cycle outcome variables. This issue is of interest considering that vitamin D deficiency is easily amenable to correction and oral vitamin D supplementation is cheap and without significant side effects. Surprisingly, no studies are currently available assessing vitamin D status among male partners of couples undergoing ART, while seven studies on vitamin D status of women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for ART were found and included in the review. Results show that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among women undergoing COH, ranging from 21% to 31% across studies conducted in Western countries and reaching 75-99% in Iranian studies. Data on vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels <20 ng/ml) in relation to ART outcomes could be extracted from three studies and included in the meta-analysis, yielding a common risk ratio (RR) of 0.89 (95% CI 0.53-1.49) and showing a lower but not statistically significant likelihood of clinical pregnancy for vitamin-D-deficient women compared with vitamin-D-sufficient patients. In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine assessment of vitamin D status to predict the clinical pregnancy rate in couples undergoing ART. The partly conflicting results of the available studies, potentially explaining the lack of statistical significance for a negative influence of vitamin D deficiency on clinical pregnancy rate, are likely secondary to confounders and insufficient sample size, and further larger cohort and randomised controlled studies are required.
