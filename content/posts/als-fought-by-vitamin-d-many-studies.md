#### Worse ASL at diagnosis associated with low Vitamin D - May 2020

 **Low 25OH Vitamin D Blood Levels Are Independently Associated With Higher Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Severity Scores: Results From a Prospective Study**

Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. Prognosis is highly variable, ranging from a few months to more than 30 years. 25OH vitamin D (25OH VD) blood levels have been associated with a worse prognosis of ALS, but these results remain in dispute. We addressed this controversy with a prospective study and multivariate analysis to study the influence of known clinical prognostic factors of the disease and 25OH VD levels on Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) severity score (ALS-SS), as defined by the monthly rate of decline of ALSFRS-R score, to identify the factors most closely linked to the risk of worsening of the disease.

Results: This prospective cohort of ALS patients recruited 127 individuals, and 105 of them met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of onset was 62.2 ± 12.1 years, 32% of subjects had bulbar onset, and the gender ratio was 1.44 (male/female). Mean 25OH VD level was 26.8 ± 10.8 ng/ml and was similar between males and females.

Patients with 25OH VD levels <15 ng/ml had significantly higher ALS-SS at inclusion (ALS-SSi) than those with normal levels (>30 ng/ml), p = 0.011. The study of ALS-SS as calculated at the end of follow-up (ALS-SSe) was not found to correlate to initial 25OH VD levels (r = −0.19; p = 0.084). Univariate analysis showed that ALS-SSe correlated with 25OH VD levels, ALS duration at inclusion, slow vital capacity (SVC) at inclusion, and SVC loss. The multivariate model showed that 25OH VD levels were independently associated with ALS-SSe: r = −0.0125, p = 0.033. Log-rank test with Kaplan–Meier curves did not show significant differences in survival between the groups defined by 25OH VD levels: <15, >15 and <30, and > 30 ng/ml, p = 0.88.

Conclusions: This prospective study in ALS patients confirmed previous retrospective results: ALS-SSi is significantly higher in patients with severe VD deficiency. For the first time, multivariate analysis showed that 25OH VD level was an independent prognostic factor correlated to ALS-SSe, suggesting that discrepancies between previous works could be due to confounders. It would be important that the present work be replicated in larger samples to confirm the present findings.

#### Even 2,000 IU helped all 20 ALS patients in the clinical trial - in 2013

 **Vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.** 

J Clin Neurosci. 2013 Jun 28. pii: S0967-5868(13)00149-5. [doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2013.01.011.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2013.01.011.)

We studied 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) levels in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the effect of vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D levels were checked in 37 consecutive patients with ALS. Demographic data, vitamin D supplementation, change in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) score, and side effects from vitamin D were noted over a 9-month follow-up period. ALSFRS-R scores were compared between patients who took vitamin D and those who did not. The median age was 55 years, and the median time since symptom onset was 61 months. The mean vitamin D level was 22.3ng/mL (normal range, 30-80ng/mL). Eighty-one percent of patients had a vitamin D level lower than 30ng/mL, and 43% had a vitamin D level lower than 20ng/mL.

Twenty patients took  **2000 international units of vitamin D daily** . After adjustment for age and baseline vitamin D levels in a linear regression model, the ALSFRS-R score decline was smaller in patients taking vitamin D at 9 months (p=0.02) but was not significantly different at 3 or 6 months. Median vitamin D levels rose from 18.5 to 31.0ng/mL at 6 months in the group taking vitamin D. No side effects secondary to vitamin D supplementation were reported. Vitamin D supplementation at 2000 international units daily was safe over a period of 9 months and may have a beneficial effect on ALSFRS-R scores. Further studies are warranted to determine whether there is a benefit in vitamin D supplementation for all ALS patients.

#### Vitamin D as a potential therapy in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (mouse ALS) – Feb 2014

CNS Neurosci Ther. 2014 Feb;20(2):101-11. [doi: 10.1111/cns.12204.](https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.12204.)

Gianforcaro A1, Hamadeh MJ.

1School of Kinesiology and Health Science, Faculty of Health, and Muscle Health Research Centre, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Vitamin D has been demonstrated to influence multiple aspects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology.

Both human and rodent central nervous systems express the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and/or its enzymatic machinery needed to activate the hormone fully.

Clinical research suggests that vitamin D treatment can improve compromised human muscular ability and increase muscle size, supported by the loss of motor function and muscle mass in animals following VDR knockout, as well as increased muscle protein synthesis and ATP production following vitamin D supplementation.

Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce the expression of biomarkers associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with

* multiple sclerosis,

* rheumatoid arthritis,

* congestive heart failure,

* Parkinson's disease and

* Alzheimer's disease;

diseases that share common pathophysiologies with ALS.

Furthermore, vitamin D treatment greatly attenuates hypoxic brain damage in vivo and reduces neuronal lethality of  **glutamate**  insult in vitro, a hallmark trait of ALS glutamate excitotoxicity.

We have recently shown that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation improved, whereas vitamin D3 restriction worsened functional capacity in the G93A  **mouse model of ALS** .

In sum, evidence demonstrates that vitamin D, unlike the anti glutamatergic agent Riluzole, affects multiple aspects of ALS pathophysiology and could provide a greater cumulative effect.

#### ALS worse if a lower level of vitamin D - June 2015

 **Vitamin D is Not a Protective Factor in ALS** 

CNS Neurosci Ther. 2015 Jun 20. doi 10.1111/cns.12423

Blasco H1,2, Madji Hounoum B1, Dufour-Rainfray D1,3, Patin F1, Maillot F4,5, Beltran S6, Gordon PH7, Andres CR1,2, Corcia P1,6.

AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with poorer prognosis in ALS. A better understanding of the role of vitamin D in ALS is needed to determine whether trials of systematic supplementation are justified. Our aim was to report vitamin D levels during the course of ALS and to evaluate its relationship with clinical parameters at diagnosis and with disease progression.

METHODS: We prospectively collected vitamin D serum concentrations from 125 consecutive ALS patients. Cox proportional hazard models analyzed the relationship between vitamin D concentrations, clinical parameters, and survival.

RESULTS: The mean vitamin D concentration was below our laboratory's lower limit of normal (P < 0.0001) and did not change during the course of the disease. The concentrations were higher in patients with bulbar onset (P = 0.003) and were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.0095).  **Models with ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised) and BMI as covariates showed that vitamin D concentrations predicted a worse prognosis.** 

CONCLUSION: .Our cohort's distribution of vitamin D concentrations was consistent with previous reports.  **Surprisingly, we noted a negative effect of higher vitamin D levels on prognosis in ALS** . More detailed research is warranted to determine whether vitamin D manipulation could benefit patients. PMID: 26096806

#### ALS survival does not vary with vitamin D level (greater or less than 10 nanograms) - Aug 2016

 **Vitamin D levels are not predictors of survival in a clinic population of patients with ALS.** 

J Neurol Sci. 2016 Aug 15;367:83-8. [doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2016.05.007.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2016.05.007.) Epub 2016 May 7.

Yang J1, Park JS2, Oh KW2, Oh SI3, Park HM4, Kim SH5.

OBJECTIVE:

This study aimed to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations, bone mineral density (BMD), and the parameters of bone metabolism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and their correlation with survival.

METHODS:

We retrospectively analyzed data from 100 ALS patients who consecutively visited a single referral ALS clinic between January and December 2011. Sex, age, and site of symptom onset and death were recorded. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was dichotomized as <10ng/ml and ≥10ng/ml.

RESULTS:

There was absent relationship between serum 25(OH)D and concentration of bone turnover parameters or between 25(OH)D and BMD. According to the results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test, the survival rates of patients without (≥10ng/ml) and of those with severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10ng/ml) were not significantly different. Cox regression analysis showed that a poor prognosis was most correlated with older age at onset and bulbar onset after adjustment for all the clinical factors.

CONCLUSIONS:

In conclusion, vitamin D levels were not correlated to other bone markers and survival in a clinic population of ALS patients.

#### ALS is not helped by 25,000 IU every 15 days (no surprise). RCT Jan 2017

Vitamin D in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Funct Neurol. 2017 Jan/Mar;32(1):35-40.

Libonati L, Onesti E, Gori MC, Ceccanti M, Cambieri C, Fabbri A, Frasca V, Inghilleri M.

Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a potential treatment to delay amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression. The aims of this study were to retrospectively compare vitamin D blood levels in ALS patients with those in healthy subjects, correlate vitamin D blood levels with clinical functions in patients, and evaluate whether vitamin D administration could modify the disease's clinical progression. Vitamin D blood levels were evaluated in 57ALS patients and in 57 healthy subjects. In the ALS patients, the following clinical variables were evaluated every 3 months: Medical Research Council scale (MRC) score, revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) score and forced vital capacity (FVC). Twenty-four patients were treated with high doses of cholecalciferol. No significant differences were found between the vitamin D blood levels in the ALS patients (18.8 ± 12.2) and the healthy subjects (20.7 ± 10.1). The vitamin D levels in ALS patients did not correlate with recorded clinical parameters. No clinical differences in terms of ALSFRS-R, MRC, or FVC were found between the treated and the untreated patients over time. In ALS, as in other chronic neurological diseases, vitamin D levels in blood appeared reduced, but no difference was found between the levels in ALS patients and healthy subjects. Oral vitamin D supplementation in ALS patients was not associated with a better prognosis than in untreated ALS patients. Further prospective controlled studies are needed to clarify the effect of vitamin D on the progression of ALS disease.

* When Amylyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. snagged US approval for a $158,000-a-year drug to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, it was a controversial decision. The company had completed only one small efficacy trial in 137 patients. The first time the drug went before a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel in March 2022, the panel voted 6-4 that the drug had not been proven to be effective.

The FDA, under pressure from patient groups to approve the medicine, took the unusual move of convening a second panel hearing on the same drug less than six months later. At the second hearing, Amylyx co-founder Justin Klee promised to take the drug off the market if it was approved and later studies failed to confirm the medicine’s effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine whether serum vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels are associated with disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

METHODS:

25(OH)D was measured in subjects enrolled in a multicenter study to validate ALS biomarkers. Baseline 25(OH)D levels were correlated with baseline ALSFRS-R scores. Average 25(OH)D levels from baseline and month 6 visits (seasonally asynchronous) were used to predict the subsequent rate of change in ALSFRS-R from month 6 to month 18.

RESULTS:

Most subjects had either insufficient or deficient 25(OH)D levels. Lower 25(OH)D was associated with lower ALSFRS-R gross motor scores but not lower ALSFRS-R total scores at baseline. 25(OH)D levels were not predictive of disease progression over the next 12 months.

CONCLUSION:

25(OH)D was associated with baseline gross motor ALSFRS-R scores but did not predict the rate of disease progression. Vitamin D levels may reflect poor mobility in patients with ALS. Muscle Nerve, 2017 Muscle Nerve 56: 726-731, 2017.

#### ALS motor functions not helped by monthly 100,000 IU - June 2019

 **Vitamin D supplementation has no effects on the progression of motor dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).** 

Eur J Clin Nutr. 2019 Jun 13. [doi: 10.1038/s41430-019-0448-3](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-019-0448-3)

OBJECTIVES:

To investigate the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on the progression of motor disability in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels, on the basis of the hypothesis of potential neuroprotective effects of vitamin D supplementation.

METHODS:

Forty-eight ALS patients, 34 with deficient (<20 ng/mL) and 14 with insufficient (20-29 ng/mL) serum levels of 25(OH)D, were randomized and treated by 3 different doses of cholecalciferol [50.000, 75.000 and 100.000 international units (IU) /month](50.000,%2075.000%20and%20100.000%20international%20units%20(IU)%20/month) and evaluated after 6-months. Assessment of motor dysfunction at baseline and after 6 months included ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALFRS-R) and upper motor neuron (UMN) scores and blood samples for 25(OH)D levels.

RESULTS:

Clinical data of 33 patients were available after 6 months. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), with pre-treatment measurements included as a covariate, did not show statistically significant differences in the ALSFRS-R (p > 0.05) and UMN (p > 0.05) among the patient groups who underwent 3 different doses of cholecalciferol. Conversely, the treatment with 75.000 IU/month or 100.000 IU/month induced a significant increase in serum levels of 25(OH)D in comparison with the supplementation with 50.000 IU/month; no significant differences were found between 75.000 IU/month and 100.000 IU/month.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings highlighted that 6-month supplementation of vitamin D in ALS patients had no significant effects on motor dysfunction. However, it is recommended to prevent medical complications of vitamin D deficiency in ALS patients as well as in other populations of neurodegenerative patients characterized by low mobility and decreased sun exposure.

 **Comment by the founder of VitaminDWiki: Only half of the participants got to a good level of vitamin D (> 40 ng) by the end of the trial, probably due to poor response associated with poor gut function. Anticipate far better results if you use any of the many <a href="/posts/overview-gut-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Gut and vitamin D">gut-friendly</a> forms of vitamin D for a longer time and/or use a loading dose.**

#### Asked CHAT-GPT June 2023: What is the commonality of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with Muscular Dystrophy.

1. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Muscular Dystrophy (MD) are both neuromuscular disorders but distinct diseases with different causes and manifestations. However, they do share several similarities:

1. Neuromuscular Disorders: Both ALS and MD are classified as neuromuscular disorders. This means that they both affect the muscles and the nerves that control them.

1. Progressive Disease: ALS and MD are progressive diseases, meaning symptoms tend to worsen over time. In both cases, this progression increases muscle weakness and functional disability.

1. Genetic Factors: Some forms of both ALS and MD can be caused by inherited genetic mutations. However, not all cases are inherited; most ALS cases are sporadic, meaning they occur randomly without a clear cause.

1. Muscle Weakness: Both diseases lead to muscle weakness, though the progression, distribution, and specific muscles affected can vary. In ALS, muscle weakness often starts in the limbs, while Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (the most common form of MD in children) usually begins in the hips and pelvis.

1. No Known Cure: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there are no known cures for either ALS or MD. Managing both diseases involves treating symptoms, preventing complications, and maintaining the quality of life as much as possible.

1. Life Expectancy: Both diseases can impact life expectancy, though the degree can vary widely. ALS often progresses more rapidly than most forms of MD, leading to life-threatening complications more quickly.

1. Research: Both diseases are the focus of intense research efforts aimed at better understanding their causes, finding more effective treatments, and, ultimately, discovering a cure.

* Despite these commonalities, it's important to note that ALS and MD are distinct diseases with different causes and disease processes. If you or someone else has been diagnosed with either condition, it's crucial to speak with a healthcare provider to understand the specific disease and its management.
