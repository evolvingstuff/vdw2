Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common disorder in the reproductive age that negatively significant impacts on women’s quality of life. This randomized clinical trial study was undertaken to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory and antioxidant markers in 44 vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) students with PMS. Participants received either 50,000 IU vitamin D3 or a placebo pearl fortnightly for 4 months. At the baseline and in the last 2 months of intervention, participants were asked to complete the PMS Daily Symptoms Rating form along with taking the pearls and their blood samples were collected to assess serum levels of 25(OH)D3, Interleukin10 and 12 (IL-10, IL-12) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). In vitamin D group, serum levels of IL-10 and IL-12 significantly decreased while TAC significantly increased post-intervention. There were significant differences regarding serum IL-12 and TAC levels between the two groups. Mean score of the total PMS symptoms showed significant improvement in 25(OH)D. Vitamin D supplementation seems to be an effective strategy to improve inflammation and antioxidant markers in vitamin D deficient women with PMS. 

This clinical trial was registered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials on 20/06/2018 (IRCT20180525039822N1).
