#### Advances in the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Current and Promising Strategies

Curr Med Chem. 2024 Feb 6;31(12):1485–1511. [doi: 10.2174/0109298673252910230920151332](https://doi.org/10.2174/0109298673252910230920151332)

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term for developmental disorders characterized by social and communication impairments, language difficulties, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Current management approaches for ASD aim to resolve its clinical manifestations based on the type and severity of the disability. Although some medications like risperidone show potential in regulating ASD-associated symptoms, a comprehensive treatment strategy for ASD is yet to be discovered. To date, identifying appropriate therapeutic targets and treatment strategies remains challenging due to the complex pathogenesis associated with ASD. Therefore, a comprehensive approach must be tailored to target the numerous pathogenetic pathways of ASD. From currently viable and basic treatment strategies, this review explores the entire field of advancements in ASD management up to cutting-edge modern scientific research. A novel systematic and personalized treatment approach is suggested, combining the available medications and targeting each symptom accordingly. Herein, summarize and categorize the most appropriate ways of modern ASD management into three distinct categories: current, promising, and prospective strategies.

##### Is there any association between Risperidone and Vitamin D?  asked [Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-any-association-betwe-Wo_ZtspoS7q8u7IzmRoSRA)

 **Yes** , there is an association between risperidone and vitamin D, primarily in the context of bone health and metabolic effects. Several studies have explored this relationship:

 **Bone Health** 

Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, has been associated with impaired bone mineralization, partially mediated by hyperprolactinemia&nbsp;[1](https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0031/ea0031p17)&nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112461/)

Long-term use of risperidone may increase the risk of:

1. Hyperprolactinemia

1. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD)

1. Vitamin D deficiency

A study of patients on long-term risperidone treatment found that 30% had vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) and 61% had vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/ml)&nbsp;[1](https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0031/ea0031p17)

 **Supplementation Effects** 

Researchers have investigated whether calcium and vitamin D supplementation could mitigate the negative skeletal effects of risperidone:

* A 9-month pilot study on risperidone-treated boys with hyperprolactinemia found that supplementation with 1250 mg calcium carbonate and 400 IU of vitamin D3 did not significantly increase bone mass accrual&nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29112461/)&nbsp;[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5831755/)

* This suggests that alternative approaches may be needed to optimize bone health in risperidone-treated individuals.

 **Metabolic Effects** 

Vitamin D may play a role in modulating some of the metabolic side effects associated with atypical antipsychotics like risperidone:

* A study published in Scientific Reports found that vitamin D might help reduce the risk of hyperglycemia associated with atypical antipsychotics&nbsp;[5](https://www.ajmc.com/view/vitamin-d-reduces-hyperglycemia-risk-associated-with-atypical-antipsychotics)

* However, another study observed a negative relationship between vitamin D and dose-adjusted antipsychotic drug concentrations, which could potentially counteract its beneficial effects on psychopathology&nbsp;[7](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.15223)&nbsp;[9](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bcp.15223)

 **Dosage Relationship** 

Interestingly, one study found that vitamin D deficient patients received a significantly higher dose of risperidone, although this association needs to be studied in a larger sample size&nbsp;[6](https://10.5958/2394-2061.2017.00003.9)

In conclusion, while there is a clear association between risperidone use and vitamin D in terms of bone health and metabolic effects, the relationship is complex. More research is needed to fully understand the interactions and to develop effective strategies for managing the potential negative impacts of risperidone on vitamin D status and related health outcomes.

#### Autism Causes, Prevention & Treatment: Vitamin D Deficiency and the Explosive Rise of Autism Spectrum Disorder  - book, 2015

 **[By Dr. John Cannell](https://www.amazon.com/Autism-Causes-Prevention-Treatment-Deficiency-ebook/dp/B00PSSDSVC/ref=sr_1_1tag=vdw-20?) who is autistic** 

 **His 27 reasons as of 2013** 

1. Both have strong inheritance features  – Vitamin D about 60%

1. Both have gotten substantially worse in last 30 years

1. Vitamin D is known to be involved in brain development

1. All autistic children are VitD deficient, but not all children who are deficient are autistic: genes are involved 

1. When giving vitamin D to cure children of rickets “mental dullness” decreases as well

1. Children with genes which give them too much (Williams Syndrome) have to reverse of autism – too sociable

1. Mothers having lots of fish (and thus more vitamin D) give birth to kids with less autistic symptoms

1. Both associated with weak bones

1. Both worse around the age of weaning 

1. Autism is more common in rich families – more likely to apply sun screen and stay indoors

1. Autism increases with drugs which lower levels of vitamin D

1. Seizures are common with Autism - Vitamin D has been shown to reduce seizures

1. Fewer autistic symptoms (such as sleep problems) during summer: when child gets more vitamin D from the sun

1. Both worse with latitude

1. Both vary with Ultraviolet light 

1. Both vary with time of year (more birth of autistics in March in Northern hemisphere)

1. 2X more urban autism  – less UVB in urban environments

1. Both worse with pollution

1. Both worse with increased clouds and rain

1. Both worse with closely spaced pregnancies

1. Autistics have abnormal immune response – similar to that of vitamin D deficiency

1. Low levels of vitamin D in mother animals reduces brain function in offspring

1. Vitamin deficient rat pups have similar brain abnormalities to that of human autistic children

1. Autistic children get less vitamin D in their blood for the same amount of sun exposure

1. The 4 males/1 female  ratio  - Note estrogen increases vitamin D in the brain (testosterone does not)

1. Both worse in African Americans (A-A 2-3 increased autism rate)

1. Both worse in Dark-skinned immigrants in Europe
