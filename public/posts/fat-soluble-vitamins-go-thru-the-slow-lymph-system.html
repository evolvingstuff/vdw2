Some people believe that the vitamin D has to go thru the lymph system before getting into the blood. Which is correct?</strong></p><p><strong>Answer</strong> Vitamin D is absorbed through both the lymphatic system and directly into the bloodstream, depending on its form and the circumstances of absorption. The primary pathway for the absorption of vitamin D (specifically vitamin D3) involves its incorporation into chylomicrons, which are lipoprotein particles formed in the enterocytes (intestinal cells). These <strong>chylomicrons, containing vitamin D</strong> , are then secreted into the lymphatic system, bypassing the portal circulation initially. From the lymphatics, they eventually enter the bloodstream, where vitamin D can be transported to various tissues, including the liver for further metabolism</p><p>.However, it&rsquo;s also been shown that certain metabolites of vitamin D, such as <strong>25-hydroxyvitamin D3, can be absorbed directly into the portal blood</strong> , independent of fat absorption and the lymphatic system</p><p>This suggests that there are differential pathways for the absorption of vitamin D and its metabolites, with some forms entering the bloodstream directly and others being transported via the lymphatic system.In summary, both beliefs are correct in that vitamin D can enter the bloodstream both directly and through the lymphatic system, depending on the form of vitamin D and the metabolic processes involved.</p><p><strong>Follow-on question:</strong> What is the role of chylomicrons in vitamin d absorption</p><p><strong>Answer</strong></p><p>Chylomicrons play a crucial role in the absorption and transport of vitamin D. After vitamin D is ingested, it is absorbed in the small intestine, where it is incorporated into chylomicrons, which are lipoprotein particles formed within the enterocytes (intestinal cells). These chylomicrons are then secreted into the lymphatic capillaries, effectively bypassing the hepatic portal circulation during their initial phase of transport.</p><p>The chylomicrons, containing vitamin D along with other dietary lipids, travel through the lymphatic system and eventually enter the bloodstream. Once in the systemic circulation, the chylomicron lipids are metabolized in peripheral tissues, particularly in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which are rich in the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. During the hydrolysis of the chylomicron triglycerides, a fraction of the vitamin D contained within the chylomicron can be taken up by these tissues.</p><p>This process accounts for the rapid postprandial disappearance of vitamin D from plasma, as it is taken up by tissues or stored. What remains of the original chylomicron after lipolysis is a chylomicron remnant, which still contains a fraction of its vitamin D content. These remnants are then cleared from the circulation by the liver, where vitamin D can be further metabolized to its active forms.</p><p>In summary, chylomicrons are essential for the absorption and initial transport of vitamin D from the intestine to the bloodstream and peripheral tissues, where it can be utilized or stored.</p><p><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Vitamin-D-in-EUI8mgpHQS6E6uZCYSOyqQ>References, images, videos, etc</a></p><hr><h5 id=summary-fat-soluable-vitamin-d-cholecalciferol-goes-thru-slow-lymph-system>Summary: Fat soluable Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) goes thru slow lymph system</h5><p>Since the lymph system does not have a pump, you might speed up the response to oral vitamin D by walking/movement</p><p><strong>Path: gut ==> lymph system ==> thoracic duct ==> blood</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/lymph-system.png alt=image width=600><hr><h5 id=semi-activated-vitamin-d-calcifediol-and-perhaps-water-soluable-and-emulsion-forms-quickly-get-into-bloodstream>Semi-activated Vitamin D (Calcifediol) and perhaps water-soluable and emulsion forms, quickly get into bloodstream</h5><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/can-get-50000-iu-vitamin-d-anywhere-on-the-globe style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Can get 50,000 IU Vitamin D anywhere on the globe">Can get 50,000 IU Vitamin D anywhere on the globe</a></p><ul><li>many of them, such as Bio-innovations Pharmacal and Bio-Tech Pharmacal, are water soluable = faster</li></ul></li><li><p><a href=/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-is-faster-and-better-many-studies style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Nanoemulsion Vitamin D is faster and better - many studies">Nanoemulsion Vitamin D is faster and better - many studies</a></p></li><li><p>Calcidiol = 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 = 25(OH)D = Calcifediol</p><ul><li><a href=/posts/calcifediol-calcidiol-semiactivated-vitamin-d-many-studies style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Calcifediol (Calcidiol, semiactivated Vitamin D) - many studies">Calcifediol (Calcidiol, semiactivated Vitamin D) - many studies</a></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Suspect: Both sublingual and emulsion forms of the vitamins get into the blood stream much faster</strong></p><hr><h4 id=asked-gemni-ai-which-of-the-fat-soluable-vitamins-go-thru-the-lymph-system-before-getting-to-the-blood-april-2024>Asked Gemni AI: Which of the fat-soluable vitamins go thru the lymph system before getting to the blood?
