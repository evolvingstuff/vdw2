#### Lanolin gets nod for Allergen of the Year

 **[MDedge March 2021](https://www.mdedge.com/dermatology/article/261868/contact-dermatitis/lanolin-gets-nod-allergen-year?ecd=WNL_EVE_230320_mdedge%20)** 

* "“From my perspective, this was a timely year to think about lanolin, as there is significant ongoing controversy about whether it is allergenic,” Dr. Jenkins said in an interview. “Numerous companies market lanolin-containing topicals as safe and effective emollients,” she said."

* "Notably, modern wool textiles do not contain lanolin, and lanolin-allergic patients need not avoid wool, Dr. Belsito added."

* "Current evidence suggests that the prevalence of contact allergy in the western European population is  **0.4%,**  wrote Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Belsito."
