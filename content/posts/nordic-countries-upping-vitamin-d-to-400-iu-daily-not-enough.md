### [New study: we're not getting enough vitamin D](http://sciencenordic.com/new-study-were-not-getting-enough-vitamin-d) ScienceNordic

* Had been 300 IU/day

* In 2010 the average intake was <  150 IU/day 

* It is unlikely that recommendation will make much of a change

* The study stopped looking at data after 2010 (suspect it is just following behind the US increase to 600 IU for bones in 2010)
