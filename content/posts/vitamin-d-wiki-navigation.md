## Information on this wiki is primarily in Wikis and Files

Clicking on file will download it to your computer - you can also copy the link and use Google Translate for first 9 pages of PDF files

Clicking on Wiki will allow Google translation (in the future)

Rather than having links to other location we have tried to put much on this web site so that it can be found by a search 

– even inside of PDF with Google Search. 

## Categories – are available in the left column – which contain File Galleries and individual wiki pages

* Category Overviews – as they become available – Overview and links to best of the category and File

## File Gallery

### You can sort on most of the columns

Default sort is by Name, but you can sort on any column by just clicking on it

* Column = Type include: PDF, RTF, GIF, WORD…

* Column = Hits = popularity ( number of times visitors have clicked on a file) 

* Column = File Size – smaller files tend to be text or graphics, largest ones PDF and occasional PowerPoint

## How to see more

* Tiki specific– click on the icon in upper left - this hides the left column and the upper portion of this web site

* Most browsers: Ctrl & F11 hides most of the upper portion of the browser - gaining lots more page visibility without scrolling

## Increase the size of text and graphics

Most browsers: CTRL & + – probably increasing your need to use the scroll bars

Note: clicked links are underlined  **<span style="color:#f00;">in red</span>**
