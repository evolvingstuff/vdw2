#### During the past 40 years there have been big increased in

* Incidence of 34+ diseases - [diseases associated with low vitamin D](/posts/incidence-of-22-health-problems-related-to-vitamin-d-have-doubled-in-a-decade)

* [use of Antibiotics](/posts/antibiotics-and-vitamin-d-are-associated-with-many-of-the-same-diseases)

* [Roundup](/posts/investigation-on-roundup-glyphosate-at-vitamindwiki)

* Vitamin D deficiency

There are many studies showing the risk factors for antibiotics, roundup and low vitamin D

The risk factors vary from 1.5X to 15X – depends on the disease

Often it is the same disease: examples - autism, obesity, etc.

### Roundup

* Kills all plants (GMO = Genetically Modified Organism) which have not be designed to resist it (roundup-ready)

* The weed which have evolved to resist it are sometimes called superweeds

* [>90% of all soy, corn, grown in the US  is roundup-ready](/posts/investigation-on-roundup-glyphosate-at-vitamindwiki)

* These crops are both directly consumed as food and indirectly via farm animals.

* There have been a variety of country-wide bans on the use of roundup or GMO foods

* China experienced [20 X increase in Parkinson's and 100X in Autism before banning GMO soy in 2013](/posts/20-x-more-parkinsons-and-100x-more-autism-with-gmo-soy-in-china)

> China then banned corn and soy from the US, Argentina, etc.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently Japan has not had the problem, and they have always banned GMO foods.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: soy does not increase risk of Breast Cancer in Japan(no GMO), but soy does in the US (GMO)

* Roundup is also now used just before harvest of some crops

* [Monsanto banned from EU parliament (they refused to respond to Glosophate safety questions) – Oct 2017](/posts/monsanto-banned-from-eu-parliament-they-refused-to-respond-to-glosophate-safety-questions)

* [The “inactive ingredients” in Roundup cause it to be 125X more toxic than glyphosate](/posts/off-topic-roundup-found-to-be-125x-more-toxic-than-its-active-ingredient-glyphosate)

* [Documentation of Roundup and birth defects goes back 30 years](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/roundup-and-birth-defects-public-being-kept-dark?) 

### Antibiotics

* First used in the early 1950’s

* particularly bad is the use of antibiotics  before gut/brain communication is established (infant)

* 10X more tons of antibiotics are used to increase weight of farm animals

* Antibiotics often substantially reduce the diversity of  gut bacteria

* Antibiotics were recently greatly increased in Australia 

> Australia subsequently experience a huge increase in autism

* Antibiotics have been proven to cause the creation of superbugs

* To minimize the threat of superbugs Europe tried (2000?, unsuccessfully) to reduce use of antibiotics for feed animals.

### Vitamin D

* Lack of vitamin D results in a poor immune system and great increase in many diseases

#### Prevention options for individuals

* Reduce use of antibiotics – especially for infants 

* Eat organic foods

* Increase vitamin D levels – supplementation/sunshine

#### Treatment options for individuals

* Increase vitamin D levels – supplementation/sunshine

* Probiotics and prebiotics may restore some of the gut biotics lost due to antibiotics

* Promising future option: get gut bionome from a healthy person (fecal transplant)

   * Example: fecal transplant from thin mice made obese mouse thin

Unaware of any Vitamin D study which also considered Antibiotics or Roundup

They could have, but failed to ask participants

 **How to tease it out?**  

Have there been big changes in antibiotics/Roundup in a country?

Has that country experienced a large change in incidence of any of the associated diseases?

Note: it appears that the change in incidence of Autism at age 2 would be the quickest indicator

In April 2014 I read an excellent book:  **Missing Microbes** , which resulted in my making 

[Antibiotics and Vitamin D are associated with many of the same diseases](/posts/antibiotics-and-vitamin-d-are-associated-with-many-of-the-same-diseases)

* Average of 17 antibiotic treatments by age 20  in the US

* The page has multiple extremely strong proofs linking increased obesity to increased antibiotics
