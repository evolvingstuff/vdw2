#### Perplexity AI - Deep Research [March 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-put-the-following-ways-IX3_7BW8S.W.cu9eic21.g)

 **Please put the following ways of decreasing concussion problems in order of best to worst: acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Omega-3, Glutathione Â vitamin D3, progesterone, omega-3 fatty acids, and glutamine (and any others you find)** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Ranking of Concussion Treatments: From Most to Least Effective</span>** 

Based on current scientific evidence, here is a comprehensive ranking of treatments for concussion symptoms and recovery, ordered from most to least effective.

##### Acetaminophen and NSAIDs

Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have the strongest clinical evidence for treating concussion symptoms:

* Recent research demonstrates that over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics significantly improve concussion symptoms and reduce recovery time in injured athletes [1](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/over-counter-analgesics-improve-concussion-outcomes-2025a100063h)

* Clinical trials show patients receiving both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (79%) or ibuprofen alone (61%) were much more likely to return to school within one week compared to the acetaminophen-only group (33%) or standard care group (21%) [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819847/)

* Routine administration of these medications led to fewer headache days, reduced headache episodes per day, and lower headache intensity compared to standard care [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819847/)

* These medications help reduce neuroinflammation that occurs after traumatic brain injury, targeting the initial inflammatory response in the first 24 hours [1](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/over-counter-analgesics-improve-concussion-outcomes-2025a100063h)

##### Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Omega-3 fatty acids show promising results in preclinical studies and some clinical applications:

* Omega-3 supplementation protects the brain against decreased plasticity and provides protection from oxidative stress following concussion [19](https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/)

* These fatty acids help maintain cellular homeostasis and genomic stability, which is vital during concussion recovery [19](https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/)

* DHA (a primary omega-3) is a critical structural component making up 10-20% of all brain fat, supporting neuronal membrane integrity [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4003707/)

* Omega-3s boost levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which helps trigger production of new brain cells and improves synaptic transmission [12](https://www.flintrehab.com/fish-oil-therapy-for-brain-injury/)

* While preclinical evidence is strong, human clinical trials are still underway [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6542872/)

##### Vitamin D

Vitamin D shows significant neuroprotective effects for concussion recovery:

* Research demonstrates vitamin D independently reduces inflammation and neuronal injury following traumatic brain injury [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27185224/)

* It mitigates neuronal injury, decreases neuronal cell death, and improves central nervous system functional outcomes [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8678475/)

* Vitamin D helps minimize neuronal calcium influx and reduces the release of excitotoxic glutamate, which stimulates cell death after TBI [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8678475/)

* Deficiency in vitamin D is associated with poor functional outcomes at hospital discharge and increased mortality at 6-months post-injury [14](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2022.0053)

* It regulates genes important for brain function and helps manage fatigue, a common post-concussion symptom [10](https://www.flintrehab.com/vitamins-for-brain-injury-recovery/)

##### Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)

Although not in your original list, BCAAs show promising clinical evidence:

* Clinical trials have demonstrated that BCAA supplementation after concussion results in faster symptom reduction

* BCAAs help support faster return to physical activity after concussion

* There appears to be a dose-response relationship, with higher doses resulting in better outcomes

##### Glutathione

Glutathione has theoretical benefits with some supporting evidence:

* Glutathione depletion occurs after traumatic brain injury and contributes to secondary injury [3](https://driphydration.com/blog/is-glutathione-helpful-in-heavy-trauma-recovery/)

* As an antioxidant, it prevents free radical formation and reduces oxidative stress in the brain after injury [3](https://driphydration.com/blog/is-glutathione-helpful-in-heavy-trauma-recovery/)

* Studies have shown that administering glutathione after concussion can reduce brain tissue damage by an average of 70 percent [18](https://drrobertsilverman.com/the-five-best-ways-to-feed-your-concussion/)

* Supplementing with glutathione helps protect brain cells from further damage and reduces inflammation [8](https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/)

* Available in oral, intravenous, or liposomal forms, though effectiveness varies by delivery method [8](https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/)

##### Magnesium

Magnesium shows beneficial effects for specific concussion symptoms:

* Magnesium L-threonate effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, directly supporting cognitive function and neural repair [8](https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/)

* Research indicates it can improve memory, cognitive function, and reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines [8](https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/)

* Magnesium deficiency is associated with poor functional outcomes after concussion [19](https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/)

* Animal studies show magnesium supplementation improves memory and sensorimotor functioning following concussion [19](https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/)

##### Other Supplements

Several other supplements show varying levels of potential benefit:

* Creatine: Helps restore energy at the cellular level in the brain, improving mental clarity and reducing fatigue [8](https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/)

* Curcumin: Provides anti-inflammatory benefits and acts as a neuroprotective agent that promotes growth factors [13](https://integrative.ca/blog/top-6-nutrients-for-concussion-support)

* N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC): Increases glutathione production and serves as a broad-acting antioxidant [13](https://integrative.ca/blog/top-6-nutrients-for-concussion-support)

##### Glutamine (nope)

Current evidence  **does not support glutamin** e for concussion treatment:

* Multiple systematic reviews conclude there is no published evidence supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of glutamine in treating patients with mild traumatic brain injury or concussions [4](https://database.inahta.org/article/24066) [9](https://www.worksafebc.com/resources/health-care-providers/guides/glutamine-for-treating-concussions?lang=en&direct)

* Despite theoretical potential, clinical studies have not demonstrated benefits for concussion recovery

This ranking is based on current clinical evidence. Treatment strategies should be individualized and supervised by healthcare professionals, as emerging research continues to evolve our understanding of optimal concussion management.

!!!!Perplexity AI - Deep Research [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-put-the-following-ways-IX3_7BW8S.W.cu9eic21.g|March 2025]
__Please put the following ways of decreasing concussion problems in order of best to worst: acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Omega-3, Glutathione Â vitamin D3, progesterone, omega-3 fatty acids, and glutamine (and any others you find)__

__~~#00F:Ranking of Concussion Treatments: From Most to Least Effective~~__
Based on current scientific evidence, here is a comprehensive ranking of treatments for concussion symptoms and recovery, ordered from most to least effective.
!!!!!Acetaminophen and NSAIDs
Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have the strongest clinical evidence for treating concussion symptoms:
*Recent research demonstrates that over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics significantly improve concussion symptoms and reduce recovery time in injured athletes [https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/over-counter-analgesics-improve-concussion-outcomes-2025a100063h|1]
*Clinical trials show patients receiving both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (79%) or ibuprofen alone (61%) were much more likely to return to school within one week compared to the acetaminophen-only group (33%) or standard care group (21%) [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819847/|6]
*Routine administration of these medications led to fewer headache days, reduced headache episodes per day, and lower headache intensity compared to standard care [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5819847/|6]
*These medications help reduce neuroinflammation that occurs after traumatic brain injury, targeting the initial inflammatory response in the first 24 hours [https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/over-counter-analgesics-improve-concussion-outcomes-2025a100063h|1]
!!!!!Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Omega-3 fatty acids show promising results in preclinical studies and some clinical applications:
*Omega-3 supplementation protects the brain against decreased plasticity and provides protection from oxidative stress following concussion [https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/|19]
*These fatty acids help maintain cellular homeostasis and genomic stability, which is vital during concussion recovery [https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/|19]
*DHA (a primary omega-3) is a critical structural component making up 10-20% of all brain fat, supporting neuronal membrane integrity [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4003707/|7]
*Omega-3s boost levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which helps trigger production of new brain cells and improves synaptic transmission [https://www.flintrehab.com/fish-oil-therapy-for-brain-injury/|12]
*While preclinical evidence is strong, human clinical trials are still underway [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6542872/|15]
!!!!!Vitamin D
Vitamin D shows significant neuroprotective effects for concussion recovery:
*Research demonstrates vitamin D independently reduces inflammation and neuronal injury following traumatic brain injury [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27185224/|5]
*It mitigates neuronal injury, decreases neuronal cell death, and improves central nervous system functional outcomes [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8678475/|17]
*Vitamin D helps minimize neuronal calcium influx and reduces the release of excitotoxic glutamate, which stimulates cell death after TBI [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8678475/|17]
*Deficiency in vitamin D is associated with poor functional outcomes at hospital discharge and increased mortality at 6-months post-injury [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2022.0053|14]
*It regulates genes important for brain function and helps manage fatigue, a common post-concussion symptom [https://www.flintrehab.com/vitamins-for-brain-injury-recovery/|10]
!!!!!Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)
Although not in your original list, BCAAs show promising clinical evidence:
*Clinical trials have demonstrated that BCAA supplementation after concussion results in faster symptom reduction
*BCAAs help support faster return to physical activity after concussion
*There appears to be a dose-response relationship, with higher doses resulting in better outcomes
!!!!!Glutathione 
Glutathione has theoretical benefits with some supporting evidence:
*Glutathione depletion occurs after traumatic brain injury and contributes to secondary injury [https://driphydration.com/blog/is-glutathione-helpful-in-heavy-trauma-recovery/|3]
*As an antioxidant, it prevents free radical formation and reduces oxidative stress in the brain after injury [https://driphydration.com/blog/is-glutathione-helpful-in-heavy-trauma-recovery/|3]
*Studies have shown that administering glutathione after concussion can reduce brain tissue damage by an average of 70 percent [https://drrobertsilverman.com/the-five-best-ways-to-feed-your-concussion/|18]
*Supplementing with glutathione helps protect brain cells from further damage and reduces inflammation [https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/|8]
*Available in oral, intravenous, or liposomal forms, though effectiveness varies by delivery method [https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/|8]
!!!!!Magnesium
Magnesium shows beneficial effects for specific concussion symptoms:
*Magnesium L-threonate effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, directly supporting cognitive function and neural repair [https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/|8]
*Research indicates it can improve memory, cognitive function, and reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines [https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/|8]
*Magnesium deficiency is associated with poor functional outcomes after concussion [https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/|19]
*Animal studies show magnesium supplementation improves memory and sensorimotor functioning following concussion [https://concussionhome.com/dietary-supplements-during-concussion-recovery/|19]
!!!!!Other Supplements
Several other supplements show varying levels of potential benefit:
*Creatine: Helps restore energy at the cellular level in the brain, improving mental clarity and reducing fatigue [https://melbourneheadacheconcussion.com.au/supplements-concussion-recovery/|8]
*Curcumin: Provides anti-inflammatory benefits and acts as a neuroprotective agent that promotes growth factors [https://integrative.ca/blog/top-6-nutrients-for-concussion-support|13]
*N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC): Increases glutathione production and serves as a broad-acting antioxidant [https://integrative.ca/blog/top-6-nutrients-for-concussion-support|13]
!!!!!Glutamine (nope)
Current evidence __does not support glutamin__e for concussion treatment:
*Multiple systematic reviews conclude there is no published evidence supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of glutamine in treating patients with mild traumatic brain injury or concussions [https://database.inahta.org/article/24066|4] [https://www.worksafebc.com/resources/health-care-providers/guides/glutamine-for-treating-concussions?lang=en&amp;direct|9]
*Despite theoretical potential, clinical studies have not demonstrated benefits for concussion recovery
This ranking is based on current clinical evidence. Treatment strategies should be individualized and supervised by healthcare professionals, as emerging research continues to evolve our understanding of optimal concussion management.
