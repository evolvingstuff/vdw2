Introduction: This study investigated the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels and the occurrence of hip fractures in the elderly using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach.

Materials and methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were used to identify studies that outlined an association between serum 25OHD and the occurrence of a hip fracture in a geriatric patient. The analysis calculated odds ratios (OR) for a hip fracture using a random-effects model.

Results: In this study, 28 studies were included, 61,744 elderlies and 9767 cases (15.81%) of hip fractures. 

In the lowest vs. highest categories of vitamin D in the elderly, pooled OR of hip fractures was  **1.80** (95% CI 1.56-2.07, P = 0.001), and

modified OR was equal to 1.40 (95% CI 1.20-1.63 P = 0.001). 

A subgroup analysis showed that the OR of a hip fracture was  **2.16**  (1.49-3.11, P = 0.001) in case-control studies; 

1.52 (1.29-1.79, P = 0.001) in cohort studies; and 1.41 (1.18-1.70, P = 0.001) in case-cohort studies.

Conclusion: Low serum vitamin D levels in the elderly are associated with an increase in the odds of hip fracture.
