## Email from author to VitaminDWiki Jan 2011

I have conducted research on vitamin D for the past 48 years here at the University of California Riverside. You can find the URL to my personal website, below in my address box.  Also I have organized Vitamin D Workshops since 1973.  They meet every three years and alternate back-and-forth between the USA and Europe. They are attended by 450 - 550 delegates from over 25 countries of the world.  The 14th Workshop was held in Brugge, BE in October of 2009.  Here is the URL to the Workshop's website >>   http://vitamind.ucr.edu/
