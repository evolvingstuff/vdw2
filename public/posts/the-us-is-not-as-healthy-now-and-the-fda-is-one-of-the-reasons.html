#### Medical Monopolies

 **[MidWestern Dr Substack](https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-space-to-create-wealth?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=748806&amp;post_id=151036754&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=ofo3r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email)** 

If you take a step back, it’s clear our medical system has failed disastrously as  [the cost for it keeps going up](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/healthcare_spending) (on [average 4.8% per year](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet)), but the quality of care gets worse (e.g., despite spending far more than any other country, currently we [rank 69&lt;sup&gt;th &lt;/sup&gt;in healthcare outcomes](https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/))

To a large extent, I believe this resulted from [a misguided attempt by Congress in 1962 to prevent toxic drugs from entering America](https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-fdas-war-against-dmso-and-america) where they not only gave the FDA the power to block anything they deemed unsafe, but also gave the FDA the discretion to determine what constituted a pharmaceutical being “effective.” In turn, [the FDA decided](https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-fdas-war-against-dmso-and-america) that extensive and costly (and  **not necessarily relevant** ) data needed to be compiled, which resulted in the cost of drugs skyrocketing and the number of new drugs reaching the market grinding to a halt.

Note: as best as I can tell (as I have to infer the number from incomplete data), the 1962 law caused the 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; cost of bringing a drug to market to go up roughly 1000 times 

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; and take almost 10 times as long.

This was a huge problem as (due to the immense cost of developing new drugs) it effectively created a “pay-to-play” system that:

* •Encouraged pharmaceutical companies to doctor trials and bribe drug regulators to get their drugs approved (as otherwise they could not afford to risk sinking that much money into developing them).

* •Encouraged pharmaceutical companies to doctor trials and bribe drug regulators to get their drugs approved (as otherwise, they could not afford to risk sinking that much money into developing them).

* Encouraged pharmaceutical companies to pursue drugs that were likely to get approved (e.g., by being very similar to an existing drug or by having a very minor specific benefit that could be “proven”) rather than maverick ones that could significantly improve the standard of care (particularly since doing so would displace other costly drug franchises and hence motivate their manufacturers to lobby against the novel drug&#39;s approval).

* Changed the pharmaceutical business to revolve around sales rather than drug efficacy, as this was something that could be reliably implemented (regardless of how ineffective or unneeded the drug was) and hence made the business remain sustainable.

* Incentivized the pharmaceutical companies to spend a lot of money eliminating “unapproved” competitors from the marketplace (e.g., by lobbying the government to target those who didn’t pay to play).

If you take a step back, it’s clear our medical system has failed disastrously as  [https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/healthcare_spending|the cost for it keeps going up] (on [https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet|average 4.8% per year]), but the quality of care gets worse (e.g., despite spending far more than any other country, currently we [https://www.internationalinsurance.com/health/systems/|rank 69{SUP()}th {SUP}in healthcare outcomes])

To a large extent, I believe this resulted from [https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-fdas-war-against-dmso-and-america|a misguided attempt by Congress in 1962 to prevent toxic drugs from entering America] where they not only gave the FDA the power to block anything they deemed unsafe, but also gave the FDA the discretion to determine what constituted a pharmaceutical being “effective.” In turn, [https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-fdas-war-against-dmso-and-america|the FDA decided] that extensive and costly (and &#39;&#39;__not necessarily relevant__&#39;&#39;) data needed to be compiled, which resulted in the cost of drugs skyrocketing and the number of new drugs reaching the market grinding to a halt.

&#39;&#39;Note: as best as I can tell (as I have to infer the number from incomplete data), the 1962 law caused the 
 ~hs~ ~hs~ cost of bringing a drug to market to go up roughly 1000 times 
 ~hs~ ~hs~ and take almost 10 times as long.&#39;&#39;

This was a huge problem as (due to the immense cost of developing new drugs) it effectively created a “pay-to-play” system that:
*•Encouraged pharmaceutical companies to doctor trials and bribe drug regulators to get their drugs approved (as otherwise they could not afford to risk sinking that much money into developing them).
*•Encouraged pharmaceutical companies to doctor trials and bribe drug regulators to get their drugs approved (as otherwise, they could not afford to risk sinking that much money into developing them).
*Encouraged pharmaceutical companies to pursue drugs that were likely to get approved (e.g., by being very similar to an existing drug or by having a very minor specific benefit that could be “proven”) rather than maverick ones that could significantly improve the standard of care (particularly since doing so would displace other costly drug franchises and hence motivate their manufacturers to lobby against the novel drug&#39;s approval).
*Changed the pharmaceutical business to revolve around sales rather than drug efficacy, as this was something that could be reliably implemented (regardless of how ineffective or unneeded the drug was) and hence made the business remain sustainable.
*Incentivized the pharmaceutical companies to spend a lot of money eliminating “unapproved” competitors from the marketplace (e.g., by lobbying the government to target those who didn’t pay to play).
