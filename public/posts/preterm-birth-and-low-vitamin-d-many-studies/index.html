<p><strong>Post-hoc Analysis of NICHD Vitamin D Pregnancy Cohort and The Role of Functional Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnancy</strong></p>

<p>Objective: Conduct a secondary, post-hoc analysis of NICHD vitamin D (vitD) pregnancy study by Hollis et al. (Hollis, 2011), which reported on the effect of vitD supplementation in pregnant women, and determine the potential interaction between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations, vitD status, and various comorbidities associated with pregnancy.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: Women with low 25(OH)D concentrations and high iPTH concentrations during pregnancy, known as  <strong>functional vitD deficiency (FVDD)</strong> , were more likely to acquire complications also affecting their neonates.</p>
<p>Study design: This post-hoc analysis of data collected from a diverse group of pregnant women participating in the NICHD vitD pregnancy study, was applied to investigate the applicability of the concept of FVDD in pregnancy (Hemmingway, 2018) in identifying potential risks for certain comorbidities of pregnancy. This analysis defines FVDD as maternal serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 20 ng/mL and iPTH concentrations above 65 pg/mL creating a definitive ratio number, 0.308, to classify mothers as having FVDD prior to delivery (PTD). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).</p>
<p>Results: 281 women (85 African American, 115 Hispanic, 81 Caucasian) with 25(OH)D and iPTH concentrations measured at monthly visits were included in this analysis. No statistically significant association was found between mothers classified as having FVDD at baseline or one-month PTD and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, infection, or admittance to the NICU. When combining all comorbidities of pregnancy in this cohort, results showed those with FVDD at baseline, 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation, and one-month PTD were more likely to experience a comorbidity (p=0.001; p=0.001; p=0.004, respectively).</p>
<p><strong>Those with FVDD one-month PTD were 7.1 times (CI 1.71-29.81) more likely to have preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks)</strong> than women without FVDD.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Participants were more likely to have experienced preterm birth if they met the criteria for FVDD. This study supports the importance of FVDD during pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong>National, regional, and worldwide estimates of preterm birth rates in the year 2010 with time trends since 1990 for selected countries: a systematic analysis and implications</strong></p>
<p>Published:June 09, 2012 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60820-4</p>
<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="500">
<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="900">
<p>Background</p>
<p>Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth (&lt;37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by UN agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during WHO&rsquo;s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10 000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3–18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5% in several European countries to 18% in some African countries. More than 60% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, USA has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990–2010.</p>
<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks&rsquo; gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.</p>

<p>Premature babies, often referred to as &ldquo;preemies,&rdquo; can face a range of health issues in adulthood, which are partly determined by the degree of prematurity and the medical complications they experienced as infants. Some of the common long-term health problems that preemies may encounter as adults include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Respiratory Problems:</strong>  Premature babies are at a higher risk for developing respiratory issues, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because their lungs may not have fully developed before birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular Issues:</strong>  Adults who were born prematurely may have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. This increased risk is thought to be related to the underdevelopment of the heart and vascular system in preemies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neurological Problems:</strong>  Premature birth can affect brain development, leading to a higher risk of neurological disorders in adulthood, such as cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metabolic Disorders:</strong>  Being born prematurely is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, in adulthood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual and Hearing Impairments:</strong>  Premature infants are at a higher risk for vision and hearing problems, which can persist into adulthood. Conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can lead to visual impairment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental Health Issues:</strong>  There is evidence suggesting that adults who were born prematurely may have an increased risk of mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dental Problems:</strong>  Preemies might face a higher risk of dental issues, including enamel hypoplasia (defective enamel), which can lead to an increased risk of cavities and other dental problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproductive Challenges:</strong>  Women who were born prematurely may experience reproductive issues, such as a higher risk of giving birth prematurely themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that while preemies are at a higher risk for these health problems, not all premature babies will experience them. Advances in neonatal care have significantly improved the outcomes for premature babies, and many go on to lead healthy lives. Regular medical follow-up and a healthy lifestyle can help mitigate some of these risks.</p>

#### Preterm birth 7 times more likely if low vitamin D 1 month before – May 2023

 **Post-hoc Analysis of NICHD Vitamin D Pregnancy Cohort and The Role of Functional Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnancy** 

Am J Perinatol. 2023 May 22. [doi: 10.1055/a-2097-2098](https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2097-2098) PDF is behind paywall

Study design: This post-hoc analysis of data collected from a diverse group of pregnant women participating in the NICHD vitD pregnancy study, was applied to investigate the applicability of the concept of FVDD in pregnancy (Hemmingway, 2018) in identifying potential risks for certain comorbidities of pregnancy. This analysis defines FVDD as maternal serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 20 ng/mL and iPTH concentrations above 65 pg/mL creating a definitive ratio number, 0.308, to classify mothers as having FVDD prior to delivery (PTD). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

Results: 281 women (85 African American, 115 Hispanic, 81 Caucasian) with 25(OH)D and iPTH concentrations measured at monthly visits were included in this analysis. No statistically significant association was found between mothers classified as having FVDD at baseline or one-month PTD and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, infection, or admittance to the NICU. When combining all comorbidities of pregnancy in this cohort, results showed those with FVDD at baseline, 24 weeks&#39; gestation, and one-month PTD were more likely to experience a comorbidity (p=0.001; p=0.001; p=0.004, respectively).

 **Those with FVDD one-month PTD were 7.1 times (CI 1.71-29.81) more likely to have preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks)** than women without FVDD.

Conclusions: Participants were more likely to have experienced preterm birth if they met the criteria for FVDD. This study supports the importance of FVDD during pregnancy.

Background

Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth (&lt;37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by UN agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.

Methods

We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during WHO&#39;s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10 000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.

Findings

In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3–18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5% in several European countries to 18% in some African countries. More than 60% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, USA has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990–2010.

Interpretation

The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks&#39; gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

#### Asked Chat-GPT: &quot;What health problems do preemies have as adults?&quot; (Dec 2023)

Premature babies, often referred to as &quot;preemies,&quot; can face a range of health issues in adulthood, which are partly determined by the degree of prematurity and the medical complications they experienced as infants. Some of the common long-term health problems that preemies may encounter as adults include:

1.  **Respiratory Problems:**  Premature babies are at a higher risk for developing respiratory issues, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because their lungs may not have fully developed before birth.

1.   **Cardiovascular Issues:**  Adults who were born prematurely may have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. This increased risk is thought to be related to the underdevelopment of the heart and vascular system in preemies.

1.   **Neurological Problems:**  Premature birth can affect brain development, leading to a higher risk of neurological disorders in adulthood, such as cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

1.   **Metabolic Disorders:**  Being born prematurely is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, in adulthood.

1.   **Visual and Hearing Impairments:**  Premature infants are at a higher risk for vision and hearing problems, which can persist into adulthood. Conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can lead to visual impairment.

1.   **Mental Health Issues:**  There is evidence suggesting that adults who were born prematurely may have an increased risk of mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.

1.   **Dental Problems:**  Preemies might face a higher risk of dental issues, including enamel hypoplasia (defective enamel), which can lead to an increased risk of cavities and other dental problems.

1.   **Reproductive Challenges:**  Women who were born prematurely may experience reproductive issues, such as a higher risk of giving birth prematurely themselves.

It&#39;s important to note that while preemies are at a higher risk for these health problems, not all premature babies will experience them. Advances in neonatal care have significantly improved the outcomes for premature babies, and many go on to lead healthy lives. Regular medical follow-up and a healthy lifestyle can help mitigate some of these risks.

#####  &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange;&quot;&gt;Note: Many of these health problems have been treated by Vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;

Yet, data regarding preterm birth (&lt;37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by UN agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.\nMethods\nWe assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during WHO&#39;s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10 000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.\n\nFindings\nIn 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3–18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5% in several European countries to 18% in some African countries. More than 60% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, USA has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990–2010.\n\nInterpretation\nThe burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks&#39; gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.\n`

__Post-hoc Analysis of NICHD Vitamin D Pregnancy Cohort and The Role of Functional Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnancy__
Am J Perinatol. 2023 May 22. doi: 10.1055/a-2097-2098 PDF is behind paywall
Shellie Davis 1, Elliott Lyles 2, Judy Shary 3, Myla Ebeling 4, Susan G Reed 1, John E Baatz 1, Bruce W Hollis 3, Carol L Wagner 1

Objective: Conduct a secondary, post-hoc analysis of NICHD vitamin D (vitD) pregnancy study by Hollis et al. (Hollis, 2011), which reported on the effect of vitD supplementation in pregnant women, and determine the potential interaction between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations, vitD status, and various comorbidities associated with pregnancy.

Hypothesis: Women with low 25(OH)D concentrations and high iPTH concentrations during pregnancy, known as __functional vitD deficiency (FVDD)__, were more likely to acquire complications also affecting their neonates.

Study design: This post-hoc analysis of data collected from a diverse group of pregnant women participating in the NICHD vitD pregnancy study, was applied to investigate the applicability of the concept of FVDD in pregnancy (Hemmingway, 2018) in identifying potential risks for certain comorbidities of pregnancy. This analysis defines FVDD as maternal serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 20 ng/mL and iPTH concentrations above 65 pg/mL creating a definitive ratio number, 0.308, to classify mothers as having FVDD prior to delivery (PTD). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

Results: 281 women (85 African American, 115 Hispanic, 81 Caucasian) with 25(OH)D and iPTH concentrations measured at monthly visits were included in this analysis. No statistically significant association was found between mothers classified as having FVDD at baseline or one-month PTD and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, infection, or admittance to the NICU. When combining all comorbidities of pregnancy in this cohort, results showed those with FVDD at baseline, 24 weeks&#39; gestation, and one-month PTD were more likely to experience a comorbidity (p=0.001; p=0.001; p=0.004, respectively).
__Those with FVDD one-month PTD were 7.1 times (CI 1.71-29.81) more likely to have preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks) __than women without FVDD.

Conclusions: Participants were more likely to have experienced preterm birth if they met the criteria for FVDD. This study supports the importance of FVDD during pregnancy.

__National, regional, and worldwide estimates of preterm birth rates in the year 2010 with time trends since 1990 for selected countries: a systematic analysis and implications__
Published:June 09, 2012 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60820-4

Background
Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth (&lt;37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by UN agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
Methods
We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during WHO&#39;s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10 000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.

Findings
In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3–18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5% in several European countries to 18% in some African countries. More than 60% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, USA has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990–2010.

Interpretation
The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks&#39; gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

!!!!Asked Chat-GPT: &quot;What health problems do preemies have as adults?&quot; (Dec 2023)
Premature babies, often referred to as &quot;preemies,&quot; can face a range of health issues in adulthood, which are partly determined by the degree of prematurity and the medical complications they experienced as infants. Some of the common long-term health problems that preemies may encounter as adults include:
#__Respiratory Problems:__ Premature babies are at a higher risk for developing respiratory issues, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because their lungs may not have fully developed before birth.
# __Cardiovascular Issues:__ Adults who were born prematurely may have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. This increased risk is thought to be related to the underdevelopment of the heart and vascular system in preemies.
# __Neurological Problems:__ Premature birth can affect brain development, leading to a higher risk of neurological disorders in adulthood, such as cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
# __Metabolic Disorders:__ Being born prematurely is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, in adulthood.
# __Visual and Hearing Impairments:__ Premature infants are at a higher risk for vision and hearing problems, which can persist into adulthood. Conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can lead to visual impairment.
# __Mental Health Issues:__ There is evidence suggesting that adults who were born prematurely may have an increased risk of mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.
# __Dental Problems:__ Preemies might face a higher risk of dental issues, including enamel hypoplasia (defective enamel), which can lead to an increased risk of cavities and other dental problems.
# __Reproductive Challenges:__ Women who were born prematurely may experience reproductive issues, such as a higher risk of giving birth prematurely themselves.
It&#39;s important to note that while preemies are at a higher risk for these health problems, not all premature babies will experience them. Advances in neonatal care have significantly improved the outcomes for premature babies, and many go on to lead healthy lives. Regular medical follow-up and a healthy lifestyle can help mitigate some of these risks.
