AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency is a highly prevalent, global phenomenon. The prevalence in heart failure (HF) patients and its effect on outcome are less clear. We evaluated vitamin D levels and vitamin D supplementation in patients with HF and its effect on mortality.

METHODS AND RESULTS: 25-Hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels were evaluated in HF patients from a health maintenance organization (HMO), and compared them with those of the rest of the members of the HMO. Patients with HF (n = 3009) had a lower median 25(OH)D level compared with the control group (n = 46 825): 36.9 nmol/L (interquartile range 23.2-55.9) vs. 40.7 nmol/L (26.7-56.9), respectively, P < 0.00001. 

The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D <25 nmol/L](25(OH)D%20<25%20nmol/L) was higher in patients with HF compared with the control group (28% vs. 22%, P < 0.00001). 

Only 8.8% of the HF patients had optimal 25(OH)D levels (?75 nmol/L). Median clinical follow-up was 518 days. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was an independent predictor of increased mortality in patients with HF <span>[hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.92, P < 0.001]</span> and in the control group (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.48-2.46, P < 0.00001). 

Vitamin D supplementation was independently associated with reduced mortality in HF patients (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.85, P < 0.0001). 

Parameters associated with vitamin D deficiency in HF patients were 

* decreased previous solar radiation exposure, 

* body mass index, 

* diabetes, 

* female gender, 

* pulse, and 

* decreased calcium and haemoglobin levels.

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in HF patients and is a significant predictor of reduced survival. 

Vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved outcome.

## Improved survival due to 1000 IU of vitamin D if initially less than 10 nanograms

* Without supplementation: start 333,   finish 31 ==>  **9% survival** 

* With supplementation  start 458,  finish 227 ==>  **50% survival**
