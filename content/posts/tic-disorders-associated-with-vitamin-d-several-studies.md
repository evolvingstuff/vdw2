Background: Vitamin D‚ÇÉ has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for alleviating tic symptoms in children with chronic tic disorders (CTDs). This study aims to evaluate the comparative efficacy of high-dose and low-dose vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation on tic severity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D levels in children with CTDs.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 83 children aged 4 to 15 years diagnosed with CTDs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose vitamin D‚ÇÉ (5,000 IU/day) or low-dose vitamin D‚ÇÉ (1,000 IU/day) for three months. The primary outcome was tic severity, assessed using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), while secondary outcomes included changes in serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels. Tic severity and biochemical markers were measured at baseline and after the intervention to assess the effects of vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation.

Results: Both the high-dose and low-dose groups showed significant improvements in tic severity and increases in serum 25(OH)D levels (ùëù < 0.05). The high-dose group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in tic severity and a more substantial increase in serum 25(OH)D levels compared to the low-dose group (ùëù < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in serum calcium levels between the group (ùëù > 0.05). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between increases in serum 25(OH)D levels and reductions in tic severity (ùë° = -2.816, ùëù < 0.05).

Conclusion: High-dose vitamin D‚ÇÉ supplementation is more effective than low-dose supplementation in reducing tic severity and increasing serum 25(OH)D levels in children with CTDs. These findings suggest that high-dose vitamin D‚ÇÉ may serve as a valuable adjunctive therapy for managing CTDs.

#### Vitamin D status and tic disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies - May¬†2023

Front Pediatr . 2023 May 30;11:1173741. [doi: 10.3389/fped.2023.1173741.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2023.1173741.) eCollection 2023.

Objective: Tic disorders (TD) are a common neurodevelopmental disorder, it can be divided into transient tic disorder (TTD), chronic motor or vocal tic disorder (CTD), and Tourette syndrome (TS). Our research is to evaluate the clinical relationship between tic disorders and vitamin D level in children.

Methods: Online databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Embase digital knowledge service platform, were checked up to June 2022 for relevant observational studies published in Chinese and English. A random-effects model was incorporated to summarize the study results. The RevMan5.3 software was used for meta-analysis.

Results: Out of 132 retrieved articles, 13 observational studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis, comparing serum Vitamin D levels between children with TD and HC (healthy controls), including different subtypes of TD (TTD, CTD and TS). The results showed that the serum vitamin D levels in the TD group were lower than those in the HC group (MD = -6.64, 95% CI: -9.36 to -3.93, P < 0.001, Heterogeneity test: P < 0.001, I2 = 94%). There were no statistically significant differences in serum vitamin D levels between the TTD group and the CTD group (MD = 3.84, 95% CI: -0.59 to 8.26, P = 0.09, Heterogeneity test: P < 0.001, I2 = 90%), or between the CTD group and the TS group (MD = 1.06, 95% CI: -0.04 to 2.16, P = 0.0, Heterogeneity test: P = 0.54, I2 = 0%). However, there was a statistically significant difference in serum vitamin D levels between the TTD group and the TS group (MD = 5.24, 95% CI: 0.68-9.80, P = 0.02, Heterogeneity test: P < 0.001, I2 = 92%). The study also found a statistically significant difference in the ratio of male children between the TD group and the HC group (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.07-2.03, P = 0.02, Heterogeneity test: P < 0.001, I2 = 74%), but no statistically significant difference in the age of children between the TD group and the HC group (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: -0.33 to 1.24, P = 0.25, Heterogeneity test: P < 0.001, I2 = 96%).

Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed that the vitamin D level of children with TD was lower than that of healthy children. However, there was no difference between the subgroup. Due to the limitations of included studies in research design and diagnostic criteria, large samples, multi-center and high-quality studies are still needed for further analysis and confirmation.

Objective: To explore the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and tic disorders (TDs) in Chinese children.

Methods: We selected 2960 children with TD and 2665 healthy controls, aged 5-14 years, from the Department of Neurology of the Shanghai Children's Hospital. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and degrees of vitamin D deficiency were compared between patients with TD and healthy children.

Results: The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the TD group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in the TD group was significantly higher than that in the control group. However, there was no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and the severity of TD. In addition, for age-wise comparison, mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and its deficiency in the TD group were the most significant in children over 9 years of age.

Conclusion: There is a correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and TD in Chinese children, but not between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and the severity of TD. There was a correlation between age and deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D; this deficiency was most pronounced among those over the age of 9 years.

#### Correlation between Serum Levels of Vitamin A and Vitamin D with Disease Severity in Tic Disorder Children - May¬†2022

Evid Based Complement Alternat Med . 2022 May 31;2022:7121900. [doi: 10.1155/2022/7121900](https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7121900)

Helin Wang 1, Yali Yang 1, Dandan Zhou 1, Chengjie Bai 1, Minqiang Shi 1

Purpose: To explore and analyze the correlation between serum vitamins A and D levels and disease severity in children with tic disorder.

Methods: A total of 59 children with tic disorders treated in the Linping Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from April 2018 to May 2021 were selected as the observation group. 55 healthy children with matched age and sex who underwent physical examination were selected as the control group. Children in the observation group were subdivided to the mild group (n = 35) and moderate-to-severe group (n = 24) according to the Yale comprehensive tic severity scale. Afterwards, they were grouped into the temporary group (n = 25), persistent group (n = 22), and Tourette's syndrome group (n = 12) according to their clinical characteristics and course of disease. The severity and serum vitamins A and D levels were collected and compared, and then, Spearman correlation analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the severity and serum vitamins A and D levels.

Results: Compared with the control group, the serum vitamin A and D levels in the observation group were lower. Compared with the mild group, the serum vitamins A and D levels were lower in the moderate-to-severe group. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between disease severity and serum vitamins A and D levels. Regarding the serum D levels, the temporary group > the persistent group > Tourette's syndrome group. There was no significant difference in serum vitamin A levels among the three groups.

Conclusion: Vitamins A and D deficiency in children is strongly associated with tic disorders, and vitamins A and D demonstrate a negative correlation with the severity of tic disorders. Vitamin D is also linked to the clinical type of tic disorder.

#### Tic Disorders (1 in 5 children) described by [Perplexity AI March 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-describe-tic-disorder-2PVDIaXMQ4G3vqDzlYA9oQ)

Tic disorders are neurological conditions that cause people to make repetitive, sudden, rapid movements or sounds called tics, which are difficult to control [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches) [4](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317950). These involuntary actions affect the nervous system and can occur in any part of the body, though they often involve the face, head, and neck [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches) [5](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Tic-Disorders-035.aspx).

 **Types of Tic Disorders** 

There are three main classifications of tic disorders according to the DSM-5:

*  **Provisional (transient) tic disorder** : Motor or vocal tics present for less than one year. 

> This is the most common type, affecting up to 10% of school-age children [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders) [8](https://www.cdc.gov/tourette-syndrome/diagnosis/index.html).

*  **Persistent (chronic) tic disorder** : Either motor OR vocal tics present for more than one year. 

> This affects less than 1% of school-age children [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders) [8](https://www.cdc.gov/tourette-syndrome/diagnosis/index.html).

*  **Tourette syndrome** : Both motor AND vocal tics present for more than one year. This is the most severe and least common form of tic disorder [6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5554-tourette-syndrome) [8](https://www.cdc.gov/tourette-syndrome/diagnosis/index.html).

 **Types of Tics** 

Tics are categorized based on complexity and whether they involve movements or sounds:

 **Simple Motor Tics**  (involving limited muscle groups):

* Eye blinking

* Head jerking

* Shoulder shrugging

* Facial grimacing

* Nose twitching [1](https://choc.org/programs-services/mental-health/tic-disorders/) [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches) [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

 **Complex Motor Tics**  (coordinated patterns involving several muscle groups):

* Touching or smelling objects

* Mimicking others' movements

* Stepping in specific patterns

* Making socially inappropriate gestures

* Bending or twisting [1](https://choc.org/programs-services/mental-health/tic-disorders/) [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches) [6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5554-tourette-syndrome)

 **Simple Vocal Tics** :

* Throat clearing

* Sniffing

* Grunting

* Coughing [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches) [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

 **Complex Vocal Tics** :

* Repeating words or phrases

* Shouting obscenities (coprolalia, affecting 10-15% of children with Tourette syndrome)

* Echoing others' words [1](https://choc.org/programs-services/mental-health/tic-disorders/) [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

 **Characteristics and Patterns** 

Tics typically:

* Begin between ages 4-6, with symptoms most noticeable around ages 10-12 [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches)

* Are preceded by an urge or sensation that builds up in the body [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

* Can be voluntarily suppressed for brief periods, though this often causes discomfort [5](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Tic-Disorders-035.aspx) [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

* Worsen during stress or fatigue, but may also worsen when relaxed [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

* Often improve or diminish during concentration on tasks [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

* Don't typically occur during sleep [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders)

* Frequently improve or resolve completely as children get older [5](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Tic-Disorders-035.aspx) [10](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tics/)

 **Associated Conditions** 

People with tic disorders often have co-occurring conditions, including:

* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

* Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)

* Anxiety disorders

* Depression or bipolar disorder

* Learning disorders [1](https://choc.org/programs-services/mental-health/tic-disorders/) [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches) [4](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317950)

 **Prevalence** 

 **Tic disorders affect approximately 1 in 5 children at some point** , with males being three to four times more likely than females to develop Tourette syndrome [2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tourette-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350465) [3](https://www.webmd.com/brain/tic-disorders-and_twitches). Most cases of tics are temporary and resolve within a year, but chronic tic disorders affect about 1 out of 100 people [4](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317950) [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders).

While some tics can be disruptive or even harmful (like those causing self-injury), many are mild and hardly noticeable [5](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Tic-Disorders-035.aspx) [7](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/tics-and-tic-disorders). Understanding that tics are involuntary is important, as punishment or teasing can worsen symptoms and negatively impact self-esteem [5](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Tic-Disorders-035.aspx).
