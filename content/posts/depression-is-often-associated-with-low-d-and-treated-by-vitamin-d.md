Depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by various symptoms that can impact one's quality of life. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, is well-known for its role in bone health, and research on its effects on mental health has only recently emerged. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread worldwide, and it has been linked to an increased risk of depression. In this article, we have discussed different hypotheses that explain the role of vitamin D in gene expression and its effects on neurotransmitters and different brain functions. We have reviewed literature that shows us that Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for depression and explored studies that show us the effects of using or supplementing Vitamin D in preventing depression among various populations.
