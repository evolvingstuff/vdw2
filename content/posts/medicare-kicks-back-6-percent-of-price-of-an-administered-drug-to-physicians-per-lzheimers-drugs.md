**I had wondered why the FDA approved the Alz. drug while NONE of the FDA neurology advisors voted for it   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3 advisors resigned in protest later that week).** 

 **“<span style="color:#F00;">Follow the money</span>”  
Cost of drug that might slow the progression of Alzheimer's in an individual by 20% =  $56,000/year  
Assume that 1/3 of Alzheimer’s of the 6 million patients get the drug (2 million)  
Cost of the drug to Medicare for 2 million people = $112 Billion  
Kickbacks to doctors administering the drug =  $6.7 Billion** 

Suspect 

1) When that person at the FDA retires he will go to work for the drug company/AMA with a salary of over $2 million a year

2) UD Alzheimer doctors in the future may get more income than Chemo doctors

Note:

VitaminDWiki predicted that by 2024 Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s patients will start to be treated by Vitamin D, Omega-3, etc – The dose size to be adjusted on an individual basis as has been the case for Multiple Sclerosis
