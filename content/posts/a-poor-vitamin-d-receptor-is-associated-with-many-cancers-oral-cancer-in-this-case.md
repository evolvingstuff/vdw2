#### Role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in oral cancer.

Biomed Pharmacother. 2019 Jan;109:391-401. [doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.102.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.10.102.) Epub 2018 Nov 3.

##### After activated Vitamin D gets past the 3 levels of VDR it can fight Cancer in 6 ways

Oral cancer is known as one of the most common cancers, with a poor prognosis, related to delayed clinical diagnosis, either due to the lack of particular biomarkers related to the disease or costly therapeutic alternatives. Vitamin D executes its functions by interacting with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), both in healthy and diseased individuals, including oral cancer. This review discusses the role of vitamin D and VDR on tumorigenesis, emphasizing on oral cancer. Furthermore, regulation of VDR expression, mechanisms of anticancer effects of calcitriol, oral cancer chemoresistance and its relation with VDR and polymorphisms of VDR gene will be discussed. The manuscript is prepared mainly using the information collected from PubMed and MEDLINE.

"It have been reported that there are significant associations in VDR polymorphisms within cancers of 

* bladder (Fok1), 

* colorectal (Fok1, Bsm1), 

* ovary (Fok1, Apa1),

* skin (Fok1, Bsm1, A-1210), 

* renal cell carcinoma (Taq1, Apa1), 

* prostate (Bsm1, Fok1, Taq1, poly (A)) and 

* breast (Taq1, Fok1, Bsm1, Apa1, poly (A)"

#### Various cancers have evolved to protect themselves by deactivating the VDR

 **A deactivated VDR limits the amount of Vitamin D (Calcitriol) actually getting to the tissues** 

 **The risk of <span style="color:#F00;">44 </span> diseases at least double with poor [Vitamin D Receptor](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor) as of Oct 2019** 

#### [Vitamin D Receptor](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor) Activation can be increased by any of:
