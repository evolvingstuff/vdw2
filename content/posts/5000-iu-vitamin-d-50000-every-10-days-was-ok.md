OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a 10-day, high-dose v a 3-month, continuous low-dose oral cholecalciferol course in a vitamin D deficient population. The primary end points were the change in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations at 3 months and the development of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine vitamin D deficient inpatients (serum 25(OH)D < or = 50 nmol/L) were enrolled in a prospective, randomised, open-label trial. Participants were randomly assigned to a high-dose regimen of cholecalciferol 50 000 IU daily for 10 days or a 3-month, continuous low-dose cholecalciferol regimen of 3000 IU daily for 30 days, followed by 1000 IU daily for 60 days. Both groups received calcium citrate 500 mg daily.

RESULTS: Twenty-six patients completed the study within 3 - or + 1 months. The mean increases in serum 25(OH)D were similar in both the high- and low-dose groups (to 55 v 51 nmol/L, respectively; P = 0.9). There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects who attained serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 50 nmol/L between the high- and low-dose groups (9/10 v 13/14, respectively; P = 1.0). Hypercalciuria (urine calcium > 7.5 mmol/day) occurred in three patients (two low-dose, one high-dose), while renal impairment worsened in one patient. 

 **No patient developed hypercalcaemia (corrected calcium > 2.6 mmol/L), vitamin D toxicity (25(OH)D > 200 nmol/L) or nephrolithiasis during the study.** 

CONCLUSION: Both the 10-day, high-dose and the 3-month, low-dose cholecalciferol regimens effectively increased serum 25(OH)D to within the normal range. The high-dose regimen may be an effective and cheap alternative for patients with vitamin D deficiency.
