Bone Mineral Density in Adults Disabled Through Acquired Neurological Conditions: A Review

Áine Carroll

Received 10 June 2010; received in revised form 12 December 2010; accepted 13 December 2010. published online 07 April 2011.

This article is a review of the changes in bone mineral density (BMD), which occur in a number of acquired neurological conditions resulting in disability. 

For each of 

* spinal cord injury, 

* stroke, 

* multiple sclerosis, 

* Parkinson’s disease, and 

* traumatic brain injury, 

the following aspects are discussed, where information is available: 

* prevalence of low BMD according to World Health Organization diagnostic categories and recommended diagnostic method, 

* prevalence based on other diagnostic tools, 

* comparison of BMD with a control population, 

* rate of decline of BMD following onset of the neurological condition, 

* factors influencing decline; 

   * mechanism of bone loss, and 

   * fracture rates. 

The common risk factors of immobilization and vitamin D deficiency would appear to cross all disability groups, with the most rapid phase of bone loss occurring in the acute and subacute phases of each condition.
