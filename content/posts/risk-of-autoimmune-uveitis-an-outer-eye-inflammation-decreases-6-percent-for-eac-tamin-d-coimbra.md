#### Serum Vitamin D Levels as Biomarkers in Patients with Autoimmune Uveitis and their Possible Correlation with Disease Activity

Ocul Immunol Inflamm. 2024 Jul;32(5):628-635. [doi: 10.1080/09273948.2023.2184699](https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2023.2184699) PDF behind paywall

This study investigated the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and intraocular inflammation in patients with autoimmune uveitis (AIU). We evaluated 67 patients with active and inactive AIU and measured their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration, sun exposure habits, number of relapses, and complications. Of the patients evaluated, 85% had significantly lower vitamin D levels, and patients with active uveitis had lower 25(OH)D levels than those with inactive uveitis. 

The odds of developing active uveitis decreased by 6% with each 1-unit increase in 25(OH)D. Patients with recurrent active AIU had significantly lower 25(OH)D serum levels than inactive forms, indicating that low vitamin D levels may alter the clinical course of intraocular inflammation in AIU. Additionally, the study found that a higher mean BMI increased the chances of an individual having active uveitis by 14%. These results suggest that serum vitamin D concentration could be a prognostic clinical biomarker in AIU.
