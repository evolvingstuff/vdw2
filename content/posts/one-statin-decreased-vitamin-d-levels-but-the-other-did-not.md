Several studies have shown that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease and an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels protects against cardiovascular disease. 

In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of  **rosuvastatin and fluvastatin**  on vitamin D metabolism. The study population consisted of 134 hyperlipidemic patients who had not previously been treated with lipid lowering medications. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to rosuvastatin 10 mg or fluvastatin 80 mg XL during the study. Lipid parameters, 25 hydroxyvitamin-D, and bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of rosuvastatin and fluvastatin treatment. Sixty-nine patients were administered rosuvastatin, and 65 patients fluvastatin. Total Cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decreased after 8 weeks of both rosuvastatin and fluvastatin treatments. 

Rosuvastatin was significantly more effective than fluvastatin on lowering total (P < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (P < 0.001). 

There was a  **significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D with rosuvastatin treatment** (P < 0.001), whereas no significant change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D was observed with fluvastatin treatment. Mean BALP fell from 18.5 to 9.6 u/I (P < 0.001) with rosuvastatin and from 17.0 to 12.8 with fluvastatin (P= 0.004). There was no significant difference in BALP levels between rosuvastatin and fluvastatin treatment (P= 0.368). 

The present study demonstrated that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased with rosuvastatin treatment; whereas fluvastatin treatment had no effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 

This disparity could be related to the potency or the bioavailability of these two statins. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between statins and the vitamin D physiology. PMID: 20370794
