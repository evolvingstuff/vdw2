#### Consensus

* UV radiation at the ground consists mainly of UVA, some UVB, and a tiny amount of UVC

* Sun, sunbeds/tanning beds/some sun bulbs contain both UVA and UVB radiation

* UVA (315 -400 nm) radiation induces pigment tanning within seconds of UVA and light exposure

   * UVA tanning fades within 2 hours and does not increase melanin in skin

* UVB (280-315 nm) radiation

   * induces  vitamin D synthesis

   * delayed tanning (increases melanin in skin after several days)

   * is mainly responsible for sunburn (erythema), photoaging, photoimmunosuppression

* Windows (glass) block UVB radiation

* Modern sunscreens block UVB and UVA, but some of them block UVA poorly or are photo-unstable in this region

* There has been an increase in melanoma incidence in recent years

   * [Cancer Research on Skin Mortality](http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/skin/mortality/)

   * [IARC reference](http://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5plus/ci5plus.htm)

* Tanning beds produce higher levels of UVA radiation than the sun - even at the equator 

* UVB radiation, but not UVA radiation, induces melanoma in  **genetically modified animals** 

   * The newest epidemiological evidence suggest that UVA as well as UVB is associated with human melanoma

* Epidemiological studies published over the last years demonstrated the association between sunbed use and melanoma.

* Many countries restrict the amount of UVB (vitamin D) from tanning beds (due to mouse study) 

* UVB decreases faster than UVA when far from equator or winter season

#### Confusion/Disagreement

Sunburn (Erythema), cataracts, and development of skin cancer are related mostly to UVB radiation.

Ban all people under age 18 from using tanning beds

#### Spectrum

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

* Visible:  450 (deep violet) to 700 (deep red)

* UVA: a small amount gets thru the atmosphere (tan)

* UVB: a tiny amount gets thru the atmosphere (Vitamin D)

* UVC: none gets thru the atmosphere

#### UVB and UVA are very different
