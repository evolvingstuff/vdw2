Organic & Natural Health Association Urges Congress to Add Vitamin D to Farm Bill to Build Stronger Families via SNAP- - WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 8, 2023) - - In a dynamic effort to enhance the nutritional support provided through the farm bill’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ([SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program)), [Organic & Natural Health Association](https://organicandnatural.org/) (O&N Health) has launched the “[All for Vitamin D: Building Stronger Families in a SNAP](https://all4vitamind.com/)” campaign. This public awareness initiative calls on concerned voters to reach out to their respective members of Congress, particularly those serving on the influential [House Committee on Agriculture](https://agriculture.house.gov/about/committee_members.htm). The primary objective is to advocate for a crucial amendment: The inclusion of vitamin D3 dietary supplements as part of SNAP recipients’ benefits. With an unwavering commitment to empowerment and transformative impact, this campaign strives to ignite a profound shift in the lives of SNAP recipients, championing their well-being and unlocking a future of vibrant health.

Research shows achieving a vitamin D level of 40 ng/ml has significant health benefits such as, [reducing preterm birth by 60%](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/document/musc-preterm-birth-paper/) and [lowering cancer risk by 65%](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/document/cancer-risk/). Recent [meta-analyses link higher vitamin D levels to decreased COVID-19 incidence, severity, and morbidity rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9258852/). People of color face elevated risk due to melatonin blocking vitamin D absorption, making them more susceptible to chronic diseases and COVID-19 complications.

 **This will not be voted on until June 2024** 

 **Currently no supplement can be purchased with food stamps** 

TBD: email addresses of appropriate people in congress
