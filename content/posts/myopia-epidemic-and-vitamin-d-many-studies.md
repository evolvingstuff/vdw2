* Myopia and many other vision problems are associated with low Vitamin D.

* More Myopia if less sun exposure 

* More [Myopia if obese](http://ophthalmologica.perdami.or.id/index.php/journal/article/view/101513) (obese have lower levels of Vitamin D).

* One study found all children with Myopia had < 50ng/mL of Vitamin D.

* Suspect that Vitamin D will be proven to  **prevent**  Myopia.

* Suspect that Vitamin D plus eye exercise will be proven to  **treat**  Myopia.

#### Vitamin D and myopia: a review (behind paywall) Feb 2024

International Ophthalmology Volume 44, article number 95, (2024) [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-024-03009-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-024-03009-9) has 35 references

Myopia is a worldwide public health problem of vision disorder caused by multiple factors, which has posed a huge socioeconomic burden, raising concerns about sight-threatening ocular complications. Vitamin D, as a kind of fat-soluble vitamin, related to time-spent-outdoors, has been considered by extensive studies to have potential relationship with myopia. We reviewed studies published in a decade which estimated the association of blood vitamin D status with myopia and summarized the universality and individuality of all research articles. Several research articles suggested the known environmental risk factors of myopia, including age, gender, ethnicity, education level, parental and school conditions, time-spent-outdoors, and sunlight exposure, and recent epidemiological studies demonstrate that increased vitamin D levels, by virtue of the extended outdoor time, may be an important modifiable factor and a protective effect that delay the progression of myopia in children and adolescents rather than in adults. The genetic studies have been conducted to get access to the evidence of gene polymorphism for explaining the association of serum vitamin D status and myopia, but the precise genetic interpretation of vitamin D and myopia remains unclear so far; on the other hand, the possible mechanisms are various like copolymerization mechanism, calcium homeostasis and imbalance of ciliary muscle function regulation, but nearly all of the investigators are inclined to remain skeptical. This article reviews the age-related epidemiological proofs, existent genetics correlations, possible underlying biological mechanisms and further values for the protective association between vitamin D and myopia, providing the possibility of prevention or postponement for myopia.

#### Video screens, Lack of Sun Are Causing an Epidemic of Myopia - WSJ Aug 2023

 **[Wall St. Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/our-eyes-really-are-getting-worse-heres-how-to-save-your-kids-vision-de16d592?mod=hp_lead_pos5)** 

Screens include Video, TV, Computer, Gaming

* “There’s something in the spectrum of visible light that prevents the eyeball from growing too much,”

* Children spend [more than seven hours a day](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2785686) looking at screens, on average, and some studies find teens are [online almost constantly](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/).

* The International Myopia Institute recommends children spend [80 to 120 minutes](https://myopiainstitute.org/imi-whitepaper/imi-prevention-of-myopia-and-its-progression/) in daylight every day. This doesn’t have to be all at once, say doctors—15 minutes here and there adds up.

#### Myopia exploding: 3X increase in half a century in Asia - Sept 2022

 **[THE MYOPIA GENERATION - Why do so many kids need glasses now?](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/10/kids-glasses-vision-increased-nearsightedness-myopia/671244/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=atlantic-daily-newsletter&utm_content=20230731&utm_term=The%20Atlantic%20Daily)** 

* " In East and Southeast Asia, where this shift is most dramatic, the proportion of teenagers and young adults with myopia has jumped from roughly a quarter to more than 80 percent in just over half a century"

* In the U.S., 42 percent of 12-to-54-year-olds were nearsighted in the early 2000s—the last time a national survey of myopia was conducted—_up from a quarter in the 1970s.

   * About a 1.7 X increase

* Discusses 7 possible reasons and several expensive methods that stop the trend - 1 child at a time
