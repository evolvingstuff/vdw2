#### Effectiveness of prenatal vitamin D deficiency screening and treatment program: a stratified randomized field trial.

J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2018 May 18. [doi: 10.1210/jc.2018-00109.](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2018-00109.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Vitamin D did not get supplemented until the 14th week of pregnancy

 **This trial had 8 different treatment branches, but failed to report the results from each branch** 

 **Subjects with moderate deficiency:** 

* I1: 50,000IU oral D3 weekly for a total duration of 6 weeks.

   * 300,000 IU total

* I2: 50,000IU oral D3 weekly for a total duration of 6 weeks and then were on monthly maintenance dose of 50,000IU D3 until delivery.

   * 450,000 IU total

* I3: A single dose of intramuscular administration of 300,000IU D3.

* I4: A single dose of intramuscular administration of 300,000IU vitD3 and then were on monthly maintenance dose of 50,000IU D3 until delivery.

   * 450,000 IU total

   * &nbsp; &nbsp; 50% > 20 ng

 **Subjects with severe deficiency:** 

* I5: 50,000IU of oral D3 weekly for a total duration of 12 weeks.

   * 600,000 IU total

* I6: 50,000IU of oral D3 weekly for a total duration of 12 weeks and then were on monthly maintenance dose of 50,000IU D3 until delivery.

   * 750,000 IU total

* I7: Intramuscular administration of 300,000IU D3; 2 doses for 6 weeks.

   * 600,000 IU total

* I8: Intramuscular administration of 300,000IU D3; 2 doses for 6 weeks, followed by a monthly maintenance dose of 50,000IU vitD3 until delivery.

   * ~750,000 IU total

   * &nbsp; &nbsp; 53% > 20 ng

 **Across both? - only 2.3% > 30 ng** 

 **Clearly not enough vitamin D** 

 **Other studies getting to 40 ng have used 6,400 daily for 200 days = 1,300,000 IU total** 

Injection is one of the many ways to quickly restore vitamin D levels

Injections: 1 if deficient, 2 if very deficient  (300,000 IU)
