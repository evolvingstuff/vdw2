# Study of bone mineral density in resident  doctors working at a teaching hospital

available as non-PDF at http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani 

## The article claims that vitamin D was not associated with BMD, but claim was based on a decision point of 20ng/ml

## Look at the data - it appears that 15 ng/ml would have been much better decision point

 **Context** : The erratic lifestyle of resident doctors may affect their serum  25-hydroxy yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-0"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-0"&gt;vitaminD <span>[25-(OH)D]</span> levels and bone  mineral density (BMD).  **Aim** : To study BMD and the effect of  environmental factors on it in resident doctors.  **Settings and Design** : Prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary healthcare  centre.  **Materials and Methods** : BMD was obtained by dual-energy  X-ray absorptiometry and was correlated with various factors including  weight, height, body mass index (BMI), sun exposure, physical activity,  parathyroid hormone, 25-(OH)D, dietary factors.  **Statistical Analysis** : SPSS software Version 10 (Unpaired t test was used to compare BMD of  different groups and Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to  calculate correlation).  **Results** : Two hundred and fourteen  apparently healthy resident doctors were enrolled in the study. Based on  Caucasian normative data, osteopenia was noted in 104 (59.7%) males and  27 (67.5%) females. Thirty-two (18.39%) males and five (12.5%) females  had osteoporosis. The BMD values of males were 0.947±0.086,  0.911±0.129 and 1.016±0.133 at lumbar spine, femur neck and total hip  while those in females were 0.981±0.092, 0.850±0.101 and 0.957±0.103  respectively. BMD of our cohort was lesser by 12.5-18.2% and 4.2-14.5%  than the Caucasian and available Indian figures, respectively. BMD had  significant positive correlation with weight, height, BMI, physical  activity, and dietary calcium phosphorus ratio. 25-(OH)D levels were  insufficient in 175 (87.5%) subjects but had no correlation with BMD.  **Conclusions** : Young healthy resident doctors had significantly lower BMD,  contributors being lower BMI, lower height, reduced bioavailability of  dietary calcium and inadequate physical activity. Deficiency of yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-1"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-1"&gt;vitaminD did not contribute to low BMD.

The risk of osteoporosis and hence osteoporotic fractures is  related to peak bone mass (PBM) achieved.<sup>[{ANAME()}ft1{ANAME}[1](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref1)</sup>The precise age at which PBM is achieved is still controversial. Two  recent Indian studies report PBM to be achieved at an average age of  26-30 years.<sup>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref),[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref3|</sup>Several factors prevent realization of PBM. Genetic factors account  for up to 85% of the variation in bone mass, while environmental factors  such as calcium and yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-2"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-2"&gt;vitaminD  deficiency, poor physical activity and poor sunlight exposure account  for the rest.

Due to hectic and erratic work schedules, resident doctors are  more likely to have poor sun exposure and unhealthy dietary habits. They  are also likely to have inadequate physical activity owing to their  sedentary lifestyle. These factors may affect their yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-3"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-3"&gt;vitaminD status and bone mineral density (BMD). Hence,  we undertook a study to determine the BMD and effect of anthropometric  parameters, sunlight exposure, physical activity, dietary factors  including protein, calcium, and phosphorus intake, and yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-4"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-4"&gt;vitaminD status on it in resident doctors at a tertiary  teaching hospital in Mumbai.

| This prospective,  cross-sectional study was carried out between May and August 2003 after  obtaining the approval of the institutional ethics committee. The  research participants were enrolled after obtaining a written informed  consent.  |
| Pregnant and lactating women, those with medical  disorders that are likely to affect BMD, those who had received  steroids, antitubercular or antiepileptic medication within the last two  years, those who had fractures within the last two years and those who  were on calcium and yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-5"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-5"&gt;vitaminD  supplements for the last three months were excluded from the study. All  subjects were asked for history of smoking (number of cigarettes per  week), alcohol consumption (g/d) and history of osteoporosis or  non-traumatic fractures in the family. Dietary intake of calcium,  phosphorus, calories and protein from all dietary sources was evaluated  by 24-h dietary recall. Calculations were based on published food tables  detailing the nutritive value of Indian foods.<sup>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref5[5](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref5[5)</sup>Desired dietary calcium to protein ratio was taken as 16 to 20:1  (mg:g) for optimal utilization of dietary calcium,<sup>[[6](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref6)</sup>while desired dietary calcium to phosphorus ratio was taken as 1:1 for  better bioavailability of calcium.<sup>[[7](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref7)</sup> |
| Participation in various physical activities since the time of  admission in the medical college was recorded. It was assessed using  the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) developed by WHO ( [www.who.int/chp/steps](http://www.jpgmonline.com/www.who.int/chp/steps)) and expressed as minutes/week.  |
| Total sunlight exposure to the  face and the hands (around mid-arm downwards) per day between 8.00 am  and 5.00 pm in summer and between 9.00 am and 3.00 pm in winter was  calculated by using a questionnaire.<sup>[[8](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref8)</sup>Use of sunscreens was noted. Sun index was calculated as the product  of hours of sun exposure per week and fraction of body surface area  exposed to sunlight. Current sunlight exposure was calculated as  exposure in one year prior to enrolment in study. |
| Blood was  sampled between 8.00 am and 10.00 am in fasting state for determination  of hemoglobin, serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, albumin,  creatinine, 25-hydroxy yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-6"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-6"&gt;vitaminD  (25-(OH)D) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. Samples were  stored at -20?C until assayed. Serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin,  creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase were measured by semiautoanalyzer.  Serum 25-(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay (BioSource, Europe S.A.,  KIPI 1961, Belgium) with intra and inter-assay coefficients of  variations of 3.85% and 6.49% respectively. Since there is no available  normative data for Indians, subjects with 25-(OH)D concentration ?20  ng/ml were considered as yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-7"&gt;yer style="background-color: Yellow; color: black;" id="google-toolbar-hilite-7"&gt;vitaminD  sufficient and &lt;20ng/ml as insufficient, in this study. Serum iPTH  was estimated by two-site binding Immunoradiometric assay (Diagnostic  Systems Laboratories (DSL-8001), Webster, Texas, USA.). High iPTH values  were defined as &gt;55 pg/ml (upper limit of normal for assay kit). The  intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variations was 2% and 3.92% for  iPTH respectively.  |
| Bone mineral density was assessed at lumbar  spine and proximal femur by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry DXA using  Hologic inc. USA model Delphi W 70460. The short-term in vivo precision  (coefficient of variation %) in our unit was as follows; lumbar spine:  1.09%, femoral neck: 3.29% and total hip: 1.26%. Bone mineral density  was expressed as g/cm<sup>2</sup>as well as T scores and Z scores  using Caucasian normative data. Osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined  as per recommendations of The International Society for Clinical  Densitometry.<sup>[9](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref9)</sup>Absolute BMD of our study population was also compared with previously  available Indian data.<sup>[[10](http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=2010;volume=56;issue=2;spage=65;epage=70;aulast=Multani#ref10)</sup> |
| Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Version 10.  Continuous variables were expressed as mean±SD. Correlations between BMD  and various factors were calculated by Pearson's correlation  coefficient. Comparison of study population's BMD to that of Caucasian  and available Indian data was done by using independent t test  (P&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant). Power of the  overall study is 90% while that for males and females is 90% and 80%  respectively.  |

Two hundred and  fourteen (174 males and 40 females, M:F=4.35:1) resident doctors were  enrolled in the study. The baseline characteristics of the study  population are shown in <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t1.jpg')]</span>. When compared to Caucasian normative database (Manufacturer's  database), only 38 male and eight female resident doctors were found to  have normal BMD at all sites. While rest had osteopenia or osteoporosis <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t2.jpg')]</span>. Absolute BMD (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) at various sites is compared  with Caucasian and previously available Indian data in <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t3.jpg')]</span>and <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t4.jpg')]</span>. The absolute BMD of resident doctors was lower than that of  Caucasians and previously available Indian data at all measured sites.  It was lesser by 12.5-18.2% in males and 13.5-17.3% in females than that  of Caucasians and by 4.2-12.2% in males and 8.35-13.5% in females than  that of available Indian data. 

Bone mineral density of study  population is correlated with various factors separately in male <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t5.jpg')]</span>and female <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t6.jpg')]</span>resident doctors. Weight and body mass index (BMI) had  significant positive correlation with BMD of all measured sites in both  groups. Height had significant positive correlation with BMD of all  measured sites in males but not with BMD of any site in females. Age had  no significant positive correlation with BMD of any site in either sex.

Sunlight  exposure showed a decreasing trend over the years after entry into  medical profession as seen in <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_f7.jpg')]</span>. Current sunlight exposure/week was lower in both males and  females as shown in <span>[ja&lt;x&gt;vascript:omovimg('viewimaget.asp?img=jpgm_2010_56_2_65_65272_t1.jpg')]</span>. Current sunlight exposure had significant positive correlation  with serum 25-(OH)D in males (r=0.18, P=0.02) as well as females  (r=0.38, P=0.01) but not with BMD of any measured site in either group.
