Background: Vitamin D is essential for many functions of the body. In addition to its primary function of regulating the absorption of calcium in the small intestine, its role in the immune system has recently been studied. The current study aimed to test the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the rate of recurrent acute tonsillitis in children. 

Methods: According to Paradise criteria, two hundred forty-two children with recurrent acute tonsillitis were recruited. A group of healthy children (n = 262) was also recruited as controls. Poisson regression was run to predict the number of tonsillitis episodes per year based on vitamin D levels. The mean vitamin D level in the study group was lower than in the control group (p < 0.0001). Poisson regression of the rate of recurrent tonsillitis and vitamin D level (OR = 0.969 (95% CI, 0.962–0.975)) showed that for every single unit increase in vitamin D level, there was a 3.1% decrease in the number of tonsillitis episodes per year (p < 0.0001). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher rates of recurrent acute tonsillitis. Future controlled trials should investigate the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the rate of recurrent tonsillitis.

Objectives

The role of vitamin D deficiency has been linked with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, but its impact on the frequency of tonsillitis is not yet fully understood. The objective of this study is to determine the association between vitamin D deficiency and recurrent tonsillitis based on current literature.

Data Source

A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Data were collected from online medical databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials).

Review Methods

All studies addressing the association of vitamin D deficiency and recurrent tonsillitis prior to March 2019. The data were collected in different phases: screening review using search words and controlled vocabularies followed by detailed review of screened articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, then a full review that included screening the references of selected articles.

Results

Fifty-three studies were potentially eligible; of these, 4 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in the quantitative synthesis. There was a statistically significant reduction of vitamin D levels in patients with recurrent tonsillitis as compared to healthy controls (mean difference, −10.71; 95% CI, −19.12 to −2.31; P = .01). The odds of vitamin D insufficiency were significantly higher in patients with recurrent tonsillitis as compared to the control group ( **odds ratio, 4.37** ; 95% CI, 2.78-6.88; P < .001).

Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency was present in patients with recurrent tonsillitis and might be associated with an increase in the risk of recurrent tonsillitis. There is a need to explore these findings via clinical trials based on large populations.
