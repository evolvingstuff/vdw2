After 9 months of supplementation: 14 ng ==> 34 ng

Dose size varied only with degree of Vitamin D insufficiency

Abstract does not indicate what that exactly means.

Language in the abstract dose not appear to consistently use the same definition

Guessing at ng levels for  total insuficiency range of 10-30 ng

| --- | --- | --- |
| Insufficiency | ng guess<br> by VitaminDWiki | Dose size |
| Mild  | 23-30 ng  | 5,000 IU |
| Medium  | 17-23 ng  | 10,000 IU |
| Severe  | 10-17 ng  | 15,000 IU |

* [One pill every two weeks gives you all the vitamin D most adults need](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need) - no vitamin D test

* [Take vitamin D3 daily, weekly, or bi-weekly](/posts/take-vitamin-d3-daily-weekly-or-bi-weekly) weekly appears to be better than daily, for several reasons

* [Reasons for low response to vitamin D](/posts/reasons-for-low-response-to-vitamin-d)

   * far more variables than just pre-existing vitamin D insufficiency: such as skin color/race

   * Would need larger doses if the goal is 40 ... ng instead of just 30 ng

The incidence of vitamin D deficiency is high globally, and vitamin D supplementation draws particular attention. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of stratified vitamin D supplementation in middle-aged and elderly individuals with vitamin D insufficiency in Beijing. A total of 448 subjects aged over 40 years old were selected from a community in Beijing. Among them, 100 middle-aged and elderly people with  **vitamin D insufficiency** _ were randomly selected on a voluntary basis. They were further divided into control group and intervention group. The control group received health education and lifestyle guidance, and the intervention group received lifestyle guidance and vitamin D supplementation for nine months. 

The doses were stratified as follows: for vitamin D insufficiency, oral vitamin D3 supplement was given at 5000 IU/w; for mild vitamin D deficiency, oral vitamin D3 supplement was given at 10 000 IU/w; for severe vitamin D deficiency, oral vitamin D3 supplement was given at 15 000 IU/w. Safety evaluation was conducted after three-month treatment. The intervention group consisted of 8%, 62%, and 30% of cases who had vitamin D insufficiency, mild vitamin D deficiency, and severe vitamin D deficiency, respectively, which were similar with the control group. It showed that the blood 25(OH)D level increased significantly in the intervention group, from 14.30±4.30 ng/ml to 33.62±6.99 ng/ml (p<0.001), in contrast to insignificant change in the control group. Stratified vitamin D supplementation effectively increased the blood 25(OH)D level, as well as the number of cases with corrected vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.
