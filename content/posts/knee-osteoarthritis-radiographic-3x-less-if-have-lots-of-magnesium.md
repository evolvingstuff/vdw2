#### Association between Dietary Magnesium Intake and Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis.

PLoS One. 2015 May 26;10(5):e0127666. [doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127666.](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127666.) eCollection 2015.

OBJECTIVE:

To examine the cross-sectional associations between dietary magnesium (Mg) intake and radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA), joint space narrowing (JSN), and osteophytes (OST) respectively.

METHODS: A total of 1626 subjects were included in the study. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Radiographic knee OA was defined as Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) Grade 2 in at least one leg. JSN and OST were assessed individually according to the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas. A multivariable logistic analysis model was applied to test the various associations after adjusting for potentially confounding factors.

RESULTS: The relative odds of radiographic knee OA were decreased by 

* 0.53 times in the third quintile of Mg intake <span>[odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-1.01]</span>, 

* 0.40 times in the fourth quintile (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.94) and 

* 0.34 times in the fifth quintile (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.11-1.00) compared with those in the lowest quintile, while P for trend was 0.111. 

The relative odds of JSN were decreased by 0.49 times in the third quintile of Mg intake (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.88) and 0.37 times in the fifth quintile (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.98) compared with those in the lowest quintile, while P for trend was 0.088. There was no significant relationship between dietary Mg intake and the presence of OST.

CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this cross-sectional study indicate that Mg intake is inversely associated with radiographic knee OA and JSN. It supports potential role of Mg in the prevention of knee OA.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

LevelIII, cross-sectional study.

#### Unraveling the role of Mg(++) in osteoarthritis. - Feb 2016

Life Sci. 2016 Feb 15;147:24-9. [doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2016.01.029.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.01.029.) Epub 2016 Jan 19.

Mg(++) is widely involved in human physiological processes that may play key roles in the generation and progression of diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex joint disorder characterized by articular cartilage degradation, abnormal mineralization and inflammation. Magnesium deficiency is considered to be a major risk factor for OA development and progression. Magnesium deficiency is active in several pathways that have been implicated in OA, including increased inflammatory mediators, cartilage damage, defective chondrocyte biosynthesis, aberrant calcification and a weakened effect of analgesics.  **Abundant in vitro and in vivo evidence in animal models now suggests that the nutritional supplementation or local infiltration of Mg(++) represent effective therapies for OA** . The goal of this review is to summarize the current understanding of the role of Mg(++) in OA with particular emphasis on the related molecular mechanisms involved in OA progression.
