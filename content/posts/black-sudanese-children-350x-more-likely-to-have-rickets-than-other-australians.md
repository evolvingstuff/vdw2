### Highlights

* 75% of rickets cases were those were refugee children, 

* 63 % were born in Africa

* 47% Sudanese.

* 85 %were dark-skinned, 

* 13 % categorised as intermediate

* 2 % were fair skinned

* mothers who were veiled for cultural and religious reasons, contributed to low vitamin D levels

### Incidence of vitamin D deficiency rickets among Australian children: an Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit study

Med J Aust 2012; 196 (7): 466-468.

Objective: To determine the incidence of and factors associated with vitamin D deficiency rickets in Australian children.

Design: 18-month questionnaire-based prospective observational study, using Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) data.

Setting: Australian paediatricians and child health workers, January 2006 – July 2007.

Participants: Children aged ? 15 years with vitamin D deficiency rickets (25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25OHD]</span> ? 50 nmol/L, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels [> 229 IU/L](>%20229%20IU/L) and/or radiological rickets).

Main outcome measures: Incidence of vitamin D deficiency rickets. Description of demographics, clinical presentation, identification and further analysis of overrepresented groups, and treatment regimens compared with best-practice guidelines.

Results: We identified 398 children with vitamin D deficiency (55% male; median age, 6.3 years <span>[range, 0.2–15 years]</span>). 

The overall incidence in children ? 15 years of age in Australia was 4.9/100 000/year. All had a low 25OHD level (median, 28 nmol/L <span>[range, 5–50 nmol]</span>) and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level (median, 407 IU/L [range, 229–5443 IU/L](range,%20229–5443%20IU/L)), and 48 (12%) were hypocalcaemic. 

Ninety-five children had wrist x-rays, of whom 67 (71%) had rachitic changes. 

 **Most (98%) had dark or intermediate skin colour**  and 18% of girls were partially or completely veiled. 

Most children were born in Africa (252; 63%) and 75% of children were refugees. 

Duration of exclusive breastfeeding was inversely related to serum vitamin D levels in children < 3 years of age. 

Empirical vitamin D treatment was given to 4% of children before diagnosis.

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency rickets is a significant problem in Australia among known high-risk groups. Public health campaigns to prevent, identify and treat vitamin D deficiency, especially in high-risk groups, are essential.
