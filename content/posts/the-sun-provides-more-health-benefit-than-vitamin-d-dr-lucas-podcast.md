#### [Vitamin D Podcast 07: Dr. Robyn Lucas](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/vitamin-d-podcast-07-dr-robyn-lucas/) Vitamin D Council

* "In this episode, Dr. John Cannell talks to Dr. Robyn Lucas, a medically trained epidemiologist and public health physician. She is a professor at ANU medical school and supervises an ever growing number of doctoral students, not to mention she has contributed to over 100 published studies."

* "Dr. Lucas discuss the benefits of sunlight, beyond vitamin D production. Dr. Cannell and Dr. Lucas also talk about vitamin D pathway genes associated with multiple sclerosis, as well as her upcoming studies that independently measure vitamin D and sun exposure in patients with multiple sclerosis in order to reveal which exposure attributes to MS outcomes."

 **Notes by Henry Lahore at VitaminDWiki** 

Nitric Oxide is an example of known material generated in the skin by sun.

Have identified very few materials and mechanisms.

Vitamin D is by far the best known

Dr. Lucas looking at MS and sun (not just vitamin D)

Not see MS benefit until vitamin D level of 100 (nmol or ng?)

Dr. DeLuca also looking at non-Vitamin D benefits – around 311 nanometers

She is starting a UVB  and MS study– just trying 311 nanometers (narrowband UV)

Recruiting participants for the study during 2015

Results in perhaps 3 years

Surgeon General US (a dermatologist) recently said – do not let a single photon hit your skin
