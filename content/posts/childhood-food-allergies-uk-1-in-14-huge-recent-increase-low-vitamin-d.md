#### Why the world is becoming more allergic to food

 **[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46302780) Dec 2018** 

* “Food allergy now affects about 7% of children in the UK and 9% of those in Australia, for example.”

* “For example, there was a  **five-fold increase in peanut allergies**  in the UK between 1995 and 2016.”

* “One study found 9% of Australian one-year-olds had an egg allergy, while 3% were allergic to peanuts.”

* “Migrants appear to show a higher prevalence of asthma and food allergy in their adopted country compared to their country of origin, further illustrating the importance of environmental factors.”

   * Note: Migrants often have dark skin and thus lower levels of vitamin D

* “Another idea is that  **vitamin D**  can help our immune system develop a healthy response, making us less susceptible to allergies. Most populations around the world do not get enough vitamin D for several reasons, including spending less time in the sun. In the US, the rate of vitamin D deficiency is thought to have almost doubled in just over a decade.”
