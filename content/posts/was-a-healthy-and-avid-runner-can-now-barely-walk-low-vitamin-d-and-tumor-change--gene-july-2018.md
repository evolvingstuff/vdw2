#### [The Young Woman Was a Healthy and Avid Runner. Now She Could Barely Walk. Why](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/magazine/the-young-woman-was-a-healthy-and-avid-runner-now-she-could-barely-walk-why.html%20) New York Times

* “Hearing about her, Gorson recalled a recently discovered hormone called  **FGF23**  that controls phosphate levels in the body. If a person has too much of this hormone, her body will eliminate it through the urine”

Typically the Phoshate gene is bad from birth and bones are bad from birth

In this case a tumor altered her Phosphate gene

After tumor was removed and vitamin D was added the bones gradually became better
