#### Future Vitamin D gene studies could examine the gene changes:

* [to the 35+ genes associated with Vitamin D](/posts/vitamin-d-deficiency-is-associated-with-35-genes-only-7-of-are-commercially-tested)

   * Vitamin D Receptor, Vitamin D Binding Protein, etc.

* If also use any of the 12+ Vitamin D Receptor activators - such as Resveratrol

* Associated with the immune system

* In tissues rather than just the blood

* [Gut genes](/posts/gut-microbiome-massively-changed-by-weekly-vitamin-d)

* If start RCT with low levels of vitamin D

* If use infrequent dosing (non-daily)

   * Many studies have found better treatment when Vitamin D is [given less frequently](/categories/better-than-daily)

   * Due to genes?

* If use UVB instead of Vitamin D

* If the person has specific health problems

* If have a poor vitamin D response

* If add co-factors, e.g. Magnesium and Omega-3

* If use a loading dose
