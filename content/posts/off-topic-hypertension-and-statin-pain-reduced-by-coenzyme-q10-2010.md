Some small clinical trials seem to show that coenzyme Q10 supplements can be used to lower blood pressure and to treat or prevent myalgia caused by hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). However, larger trials are needed to determine if they are truly effective for these purposes. The authors examine the evidence and also discuss issues such as bioavailability, elimination, safety, and cost.

 **Key Points** 

* In some clinical trials, coenzyme Q10 supplements significantly lowered diastolic and systolic blood pressure.

* Statins may lower coenzyme Q10 serum levels, and some investigators have evaluated the relationship between coenzyme Q10 deficiency and statin-related myalgia, but more evidence is needed to support the use of coenzyme Q10 supplements to prevent or treat myalgia.

* Coenzyme Q10 supplementation appears to be relatively safe. Most clinical trials have not reported significant side effects that necessitated stopping therapy. Gastrointestinal effects include abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Allergic rash and headache have also been reported.
