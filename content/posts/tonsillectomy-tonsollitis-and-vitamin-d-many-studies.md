**Tonsils and Adenoids become inflamed when a child is fighting infection** 

 **&nbsp; &nbsp;  Adenoids are lymph nodes above the tonsils** 

 **When they become inflamed they need to be aided, by vitamin D?, but not removed** 

 **400,000 Tonsillectomies per year in US  costing $ 5,400 each average**

Note: Would need to breath thru the nose, not the mouth, to get any inhaled vitamin D to adenoids

 **<span style="color:#00F;">My opinion:</span>** 

 **Low vitamin D increases the risk of many immune system problems, such as Tonsillitis  
Tonsilitis might be treated vitamin D supplements  
Removal of tonsils result in increased risk of various health problems:  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; respiratory, cancers, allergies, deep neck infection, etc.  
Suspect that Vitamin D [spayed orally](/posts/vitamin-d-sprayed-inside-cheeks-buccal-spray-several-studies)  or [inhaled](/posts/inhaled-vitamin-d-help-lungs-many-studies) would be better  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting vitamin D to the spot that needs it is very important

Background

Studies have reported that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in children and adults is inversely related to serum vitamin D levels and supplementation with vitamin D reduces the incidence of this infection. This study aimed to examine if vitamin D serum levels were a risk factor for recurrent tonsillitis among adult patients.

Methods

Retrospective comparative analysis was carried out on 100 patients diagnosed with recurrent tonsillitis with 100 age- and sex-matched individuals as controls between June 2016 and May 2022. Tonsillar size was assessed based on Brodsky grading system. Serum levels of 25-hydroxy (25(OH)) vitamin D, total calcium, iron, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were analyzed.

Results

There was a statistically significant low vitamin D levels in tonsil size grades III+IV compared to grade I+II (p <0.001) among cases. There was a significantly lower serum value for 25(OH) vitamin D in the cases as compared to the control group (p <0.001). A high percentage (68%) of cases had vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and this was statistically significant (p <0.001). There were statistically significant higher values of CRP and ESR among cases compared to the control group (p <0.001).

At a cut off (≤21.2), serum vitamin D levels achieved 78% sensitivity, 65% specificity (p <0.001) to differentiate cases from controls. Following logistic regression analysis, the level of vitamin D was the only significant risk factor.

Conclusion

Findings from our study also suggest an association between recurrent tonsillitis among our adult cohorts and low serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Therefore, we opine that serum vitamin D levels should be considered in the management of adult patients with tonsillitis.

#### Increase risk of respiratory diseases: 3X if remove tonsils, 4X if also remove adenoids - June 2018

 **Association of Long-Term Risk of Respiratory, Allergic, and Infectious Diseases With Removal of Adenoids and Tonsils in Childhood** 

JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. Published online June 7, 2018. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2018.0614

Sean G. Byars, PhD1,2; Stephen C. Stearns, PhD3; Jacobus J. Boomsma, PhD2

 **Key Points** 

* Questions  Are there long-term health risks after having adenoids or tonsils removed in childhood?

* Findings  In this population-based cohort study of almost 1.2 million children, removal of adenoids or tonsils in childhood was associated with significantly increased relative risk of later respiratory, allergic, and infectious diseases. Increases in long-term absolute disease risks were considerably larger than changes in risk for the disorders these surgeries aim to treat.

* Meaning  The long-term risks of these surgeries deserve careful consideration.

Importance  Surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils to treat obstructed breathing or recurrent middle-ear infections remain common pediatric procedures; however, little is known about their long-term health consequences despite the fact that these lymphatic organs play important roles in the development and function of the immune system.

Objective  To estimate long-term disease risks associated with adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenotonsillectomy in childhood.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A population-based cohort study of up to 1 189 061 children born in Denmark between 1979 and 1999 and evaluated in linked national registers up to 2009, covering at least the first 10 and up to 30 years of their life, was carried out. Participants in the case and control groups were selected such that their health did not differ significantly prior to surgery.

Exposures  Participants were classified as exposed if adenoids or tonsils were removed within the first 9 years of life.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The incidence of disease (defined by International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision <span>[ICD-8]</span> and Tenth Revision <span>[ICD-10]</span> diagnoses) up to age 30 years was examined using stratified Cox proportional hazard regressions that adjusted for 18 covariates, including parental disease history, pregnancy complications, birth weight, Apgar score, sex, socioeconomic markers, and region of Denmark born.

Results  A total of up to 1 189 061 children were included in this study (48% female); 17 460 underwent adenoidectomy, 11 830 tonsillectomy, and 31 377 adenotonsillectomy; 1 157 684 were in the control group. Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were associated with a   **2- to 3-fold**  increase in diseases of the upper respiratory tract (relative risk <span>[RR]</span>, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.51-2.63 and RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.54-4.80; respectively). Smaller increases in risks for infectious and allergic diseases were also found: adenotonsillectomy was associated with a 17% increased risk of infectious diseases (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10-1.25) corresponding to an absolute risk increase of 2.14% because these diseases are relatively common (12%) in the population. In contrast, the long-term risks for conditions that these surgeries aim to treat often did not differ significantly and were sometimes lower or higher.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this study of almost 

* 1.2 million children, of whom 

* 17 460 had adenoidectomy, 

* 11 830 tonsillectomy, and 

* 31 377 adenotonsillectomy, 

surgeries were associated with increased long-term risks of respiratory, infectious, and allergic diseases. Although rigorous controls for confounding were used where such data were available, it is possible these effects could not be fully accounted for. Our results suggest it is important to consider long-term risks when making decisions to perform tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.

 **[Press Release](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/what-are-the-long-term-health-risks-of-having-your-tonsils-out)** 

* "a tonsillectomy, is the one of the most common paediatric surgeries performed worldwid"

*  **1 in 5 surgeries later had respiratory problem** 

> "Only 5 individuals needed to have the operation to cause an extra upper respiratory disease to appear in 1 of those individuals", Dr Boomsma added.

* "But we now know that adenoids and tonsils are strategically positioned in the nose and throat respectively, in an arrangement known as Waldeyer’s ring. They act as a first line of defence, helping to recognise airborne pathogens like bacteria and viruses, and begin the immune response to clear them from the body"

 **Study [reported on by GreenMedInfo](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/removing-childrens-tonsils-and-adenoids-increases-risk-28-diseases-study-finds) (Founder of which had severe respiratory problems after  A&T removal)** 

“Children who had undergone tonsillectomies were found to have a nearly  **three-fold**  increase in the risk of developing certain diseases of the upper respiratory tract, including 

* asthma, 

* influenza, 

* pneumonia, 

* chronic bronchitis, and 

* emphysema. 

Removal of  **adenoids in addition to tonsils more than quadrupled**  chances of developing 

* allergies, 

* inner-ear inflammation, and 

* sinusitis

Background: The exact etiology of recurrent tonsillopharyngitis in children is not clear. Recurrent tonsillitis in children has multifactorial etiology like most of the diseases in childhood. In this study, our aim was to determine the potential role of vitamin D in recurrent tonsillitis by measuring serum 25-OH vitamin D levels and determining the vitamin D receptor polymorphism among children with recurrent tonsillitis.

Methods: Eighty-four children with recurrent tonsillitis and seventy-one healthy children aging between 2 and 10 years were enrolled in this study. Serum 25-OH vitamin D level was measured with ELISA and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism (Apal, Taq 1, Fokl) was determined by PCR. Serum 25-OH vitamin D level below 50 nmol/L was accepted as deficiency. The vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism in each group was compared.

Results: The mean age was 5.6 ± 2.4 and 6.1 ±2.7 years in study and control group, respectively. The average serum 25-OH vitamin D level was  **142** .7±68.1 nmol/L in study group and  **192** .3 ±56.1 nmol/L in control group. There was significant difference between the groups (p < 0.01). 

* In study group, 4.7% (n=4) of children had serum 25 OH vitamin D levels below 50 nmol/L. 

* None of the children in control group had serum 25-OH vitamin D level below 50 nmol/L. 

There was no significant differences in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms between groups.

Conclusion:  **Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels in recurrent tonsillitis group were lower than those in healthy children** . But, there was no difference in the incidence of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism between the two groups.
