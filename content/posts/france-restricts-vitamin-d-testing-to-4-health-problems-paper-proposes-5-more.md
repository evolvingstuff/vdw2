 **There are many many more reasons for a vitamin D test** 

 **Supplementation is more important and lower cost that Testing to PREVENT diseases**

The number of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays has increased tenfold in France in less than 10 years, sometimes for invalidated reasons. In 2013, the French National Authority for Health (Haute autorité de santé, or HAS) limited the indications for serum 25OHD measurements to 

1. rickets/osteomalacia,

1. older adults with recurrent falls, 

1. monitoring of kidney transplant in adults, and 

1. surgical treatment of obesity in adults. 

Our aim here was to note that other indications for serum 25OHD measurements are supported by previous literature and by a number of national and international recommendations, in particular the following: 

1. any situation of bone fragility, 

1. any chronic renal failure <45 mL/min/1.73m2, 

1. any situation of malabsorption, 

1. clinical signs consistent with vitamin D deficiency or vitamin D overload, and 

1. calcium phosphorus evaluation. 

We suggest that the measurement of serum 25OHD concentration should remain reimbursed as part of these extended indications.
