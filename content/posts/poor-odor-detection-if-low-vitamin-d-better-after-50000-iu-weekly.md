Objective: In this study, we evaluated the olfactory function in individuals with vitamin D insufficiency and the effect of replacement therapy on olfactory function.

Methods: A total of 91 individuals with vitamin D insufficiency and 91 controls were assessed. Smell capacity was assessed with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test. An olfactory test was applied before and after replacement therapy. The olfactory test scores of both groups were compared with each other.

Results: The mean 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in the pre-replacement, control, and post- replacement groups were 12.88±5.90, 35.76±6.13, and 42.99±4.89 ng/mL, respectively. In the post-replacement group, mean threshold test scores (pre-replacement 3.75±1.2; 12th week post-replacement 5.29±1.02), mean identification test scores (pre-replacement 6.6±0.85; 12th week post-replacement 6.94±0.22), and mean total test scores (pre-replacement 5.17±0.89; 12th week post-replacement 6.12±0.54) demonstrated statistically significant increases when compared with the pre-replacement group (p<0.001). The mean total test scores of the pre-replacement group was significantly lower than the control (p<0.001). There was no considerable difference statistically between the mean total test scores of the post-replacement and control groups (p=0.4).

Conclusion: Low blood vitamin D levels can be associated with olfactory dysfunction. Vitamin D replacement therapy can improve olfactory function in patients with vitamin D insufficiency.

#### This study  concerns the ability to detect a smell, NOT the loss of smell

#### Loss of smell is associated with COVID, Long-Haul, andl Low Zinc
