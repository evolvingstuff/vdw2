#### [Plant-Based Diets for Multiple Sclerosis](https://nutritionfacts.org/2013/05/21/plant-based-diets-for-multiple-sclerosis/) Dr. Greger

He also mentions a study of 144 Mser’s who were put on a low meat and fat diet.  

95% had ZERO remissions in 34 years – 1990 10.1016/0140-6736(90)91533-g

* "But if they started slacking on their diet—even years in, their disease could become reactivated. They felt so great that some felt that they could cheat a little bit, since they had their disease so well under control. But eating just eight grams of saturated fat more a day was accompanied by a striking increase in disability and a near tripling of their death rate."

* "How about a 50 year follow-up! They were able to track down 15 of the original patients that stuck to the diet, now in their 70s and 80s, with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years, and 13 out of 15 were walking around normal in all respects. Conclusion: “This study indicated that, in all probability, MS is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat.”"

Followup of the study which was published in 2016 did not find a benefit  <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/swank-followup.pdf">PDF</a>

"The study diet was based on starchy plant foods (beans, breads,corn, pastas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and rice with the addition of fruits and non-starchy vegetables). Approximately 10% of calories were derived from fat, 14% from protein and 76% from carbohydrate (Anonymous, 2014). Meat, fish, eggs, dairy products and vegetable oils (such as corn and olive oil) were prohibited. We used monthly FFQ and telephone contact to assess diet adherence.  **Subjects were considered diet adherent if they consumed 20% or less of calories from fat at least 80% of the time during the study."**
