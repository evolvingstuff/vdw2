Investigators examined the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency among urban African-American youngsters with asthma compared with their African-American peers without asthma. They conducted the study at an urban pediatric medical center in Washington, DC, in 92 asthmatic but otherwise healthy children from 6 to 20 years old who had physician-diagnosed asthma for longer than a year. The control participants were 21 children from 6 to 9 years of age with no history of asthma.

Investigators performed a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on plasma (from cases) or serum (from control participants) to measure D2 and D3 isoforms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D; they defined insufficiency as less than  **30 ng/mL**  and deficiency as less than 20 ng/mL. After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index percentile, and season of sampling, the median vitamin D level of those with asthma was significantly lower than that of the control participants without asthma. Furthermore, the prevalence of vitamin D

 **insufficiency**  was significantly greater among cases than controls  **(86% vs 19%)** . Investigators observed a similar association for vitamin D 

 **deficiency** :  **54% versus 5%**  (Freishtat RJ, et al. J Pediatr. 2010;156<sup>[6]</sup>:948-952).

Commentary

Here is yet another interesting observation about vitamin D, one that raises more questions than it answers. Does asthma limit outside activity and decrease vitamin D levels or do low vitamin D levels exacerbate asthma? And how does obesity fit into this interaction? While all this is being sorted out, I may begin screening for vitamin D deficiency in hospitalized asthmatics. â€”Michael Burke, MD
