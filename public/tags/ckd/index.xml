&lt;p>Background: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD and vascular disease are etiologically linked. Evidence suggests deficiencies of vitamins D and K may adversely affect the cardiovascular system, but data from longitudinal studies are lacking. We hypothesized that deficiencies of vitamins D and K may be associated with incident CKD and/or incident albuminuria amongst members of the general population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5700 IU of vitamin D helped half with chronic kidney disease if not having dialysis</title><link>/posts/5700-iu-of-vitamin-d-helped-half-with-chronic-kidney-disease-if-not-having-dialysis.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/5700-iu-of-vitamin-d-helped-half-with-chronic-kidney-disease-if-not-having-dialysis.html</guid><description>&lt;pre style="background-color: #e0e0e0; white-space: pre-wrap;">

Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-diOHD), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum phosphate, ionized serum calcium and serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) were analysed. We also investigated biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (plasma D-dimer, plasma fibrinogen, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, plasma interleukin 6, plasma C-reactive protein, blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, aortic pulse wave velocity and 24-h urinary protein loss). Objective and subjective health variables were assessed (muscle function tests, visual analogue scores and Health Assessment Questionnaire).\n\nResults Fifty-two CKD patients with 25-OHD &amp;lt;50 nmol/L at screening were included. Cholecalciferol supplementation led to a significant increase to a median of 155 nmol/L 25-OHD (interquartile range 137–173 nmol/L) in treated patients (n = 25, P &amp;lt; 0.001). \n\nIn non-HD patients, we saw a significant increase in 1,25-diOHD (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and a lowering of PTH (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.001). \n\nThis was not observed in HD patients.

Background Hypovitaminosis D is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D replenishment in CKD are not well described.

Methods An 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel intervention study was conducted in haemodialysis (HD) and non-HD CKD patients. Treatment consisted of 40 000 IU of cholecalciferol orally per week. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-diOHD), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum phosphate, ionized serum calcium and serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) were analysed. We also investigated biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (plasma D-dimer, plasma fibrinogen, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, plasma interleukin 6, plasma C-reactive protein, blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, aortic pulse wave velocity and 24-h urinary protein loss). Objective and subjective health variables were assessed (muscle function tests, visual analogue scores and Health Assessment Questionnaire).

Results Fifty-two CKD patients with 25-OHD &amp;lt;50 nmol/L at screening were included. Cholecalciferol supplementation led to a significant increase to a median of 155 nmol/L 25-OHD (interquartile range 137–173 nmol/L) in treated patients (n = 25, P &amp;lt; 0.001). 

In non-HD patients, we saw a significant increase in 1,25-diOHD (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and a lowering of PTH (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.001). 

This was not observed in HD patients. Cholecalciferol supplementation caused a significant increase in serum calcium and FGF-23.

Conclusions 25-OHD replenishment was effectively obtained with the employed cholecalciferol dosing. In non-HD patients, it had favourable effects on 1,25-diOHD and PTH. Vitamin D-supplemented patients must be monitored for hypercalcaemia. 

The present study could not identify significant pleiotropic effects of 25-OHD replenishment.

!!Summary by author for VitaminDWiki
*40,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for just 8 weeks to 25 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D levels below 20 nanograms/mL) , placebo to 24 matched controls 
*Active treatment corrected hypovitaminosis in all patients with final average vitamin D levels of 62 nanograms/mL versus 9 nanograms/mL in the placebo group. 
+Note: Vitamin D levels would probably have been much higher if the trial had lasted longer 
+Vitamin D half-life is 4-8 weeks.
*Beneficial effects on bone metabolism were seen in the subgroup of patients who were NOT undergoing dialysis, but not in patients undergoing dialysis

+It is amazing that such excellent results were buried in the paper. They were not in the title nor abstract.
+This is the result of about 10 trials with about 5,000 kidney disease patients.
