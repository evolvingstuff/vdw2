Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a number of diseases, including influenza. Whether or not this reflects a causal relationship is unknown. We therefore wanted to examine if supplementation with vitamin D would affect the incidence and severity of influenza-like disease. 

Methods: Questionnaires on influenza were sent to subjects participating in ongoing placebo-controlled intervention studies with vitamin D supplementation, up until the end of April 2010. 

Results: Five hundred and sixty-nine subjects from 10 different clinical trials were included in the study, of whom 

289 were randomized to receive vitamin D  **(1111-6800 IU/day)**  and 

280 to receive placebo. 

Influenza-like disease during the previous fall/winter was reported in 

* 38 subjects in the vitamin D group and 

* 42 in the placebo group (non-significant), of whom 

* 25 and 26 subjects, respectively, fulfilled our clinical criteria for influenza. 

In these latter subjects, the duration of illness was significantly longer among those in the vitamin D group than among those in the placebo group (median 7 (range 2-60) days vs median 4 (range 2-18) days; p = 0.007). 

However, this difference was not statistically significant if all 38 (vitamin D) and 42 (placebo) subjects who reported symptoms were included. 

Conclusion: Our results do not support the hypothesis that high doses of vitamin D supplementation will have a pronounced effect on influenza-like disease in populations not targeted for high influenza risk.

## Abstract does not indicate

1. Existing vitamin D levels. We assume that subjects were all in Norway – so probably already had high level of vitamin D due to supplementation, cod liver oil, or tanning beds

1. If the subjects were  **<span style="color:#00F;">taking vitamin A</span>**  (cod liver oil) which cancels much of the benefit of Vitamin D

1. If vitamin D was given before the flu season started.– Vitamin D can take months to re-stock and then help

1. Difference results for different vitamin D doses

> Answer by author:<span style="color:#00F;">There was no significant difference between those taking high vs low dose.</span>
