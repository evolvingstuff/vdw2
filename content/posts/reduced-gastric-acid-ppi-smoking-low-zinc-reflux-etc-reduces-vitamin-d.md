Vitamin D3 deficiency is a global phenomenon, which can be managed with supplementation and food fortification. However, vitamin D3 bioaccessibility may depend on factors such as matrix composition and interactions throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This research focused on the effect of different matrices on vitamin D3 content during digestion, as well as the effect of pH on its bioaccessibility. The INFOGEST protocol was employed to simulate digestion. Three different types of commercial supplements, two foods naturally rich in vitamin D3, and three fortified foods were investigated. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography was used to determine the initial vitamin D3 content in the supplements and foods, as well as after each digestion stage. The results indicate that the foods exhibited higher bioaccessibility indices compared to the supplements and a higher percentage retention at the end of the gastric phase. The pH study revealed a positive correlation between an increased gastric pH and the corresponding content of vitamin D3. Interestingly, exposing the matrix to a low pH during the gastric phase resulted in an increased intestinal content of D3. Vitamin D3 is more bioaccessible from foods than supplements, and its bioaccessibility is susceptible to changes in gastric pH. Fasting conditions (i.e., gastric pH = 1) enhance the vitamin’s bioaccessibility.

#### What are reasons for decreased gastric acid? - asked [Perplexity AI Jan 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-reasons-for-decreased-lpF8Mj3sQiionMddRXiO0g)

Several key factors can lead to decreased gastric acid production (hypochlorhydria):

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Medical Conditions</span>** 

 **Atrophic Gastritis** 

The most common cause involves inflammation of the stomach lining, typically resulting from autoimmune disorders or H. pylori infection &nbsp;[4](https://zoe.com/learn/low-stomach-acid-symptoms) &nbsp;[8](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23392-hypochlorhydria)

 **Infections** 

H. pylori bacteria is particularly significant, as it neutralizes stomach acid and can damage acid-producing cells &nbsp;[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322491) &nbsp;[9](https://thefunctionalgutclinic.com/blog/news/low-stomach-acid-achlorhydria-is-it-real-how-can-we-test-and-how-can-we-treat/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Age-Related Factors</span>** 

People over 65 have the highest risk of developing low stomach acid, as the stomach naturally produces less acid with aging &nbsp;[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322491) &nbsp;[6](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-is-hypochlorhydria)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Medications</span>** 

Long-term use of certain medications can reduce stomach acid production:

* Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

* Antacids

* Medications for acid reflux or heartburn &nbsp;[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322491) &nbsp;[6](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-is-hypochlorhydria)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Nutritional Factors</span>** 

* Zinc deficiency, as zinc is necessary for stomach acid production

* Poor diet leading to vitamin deficiencies

* High sugar intake &nbsp;[3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-to-increase-stomach-acid) &nbsp;[5](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-increase-stomach-acid)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Other Contributing Factors</span>** 

 **Stress** 

Chronic stress can significantly decrease stomach acid production &nbsp;[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322491) &nbsp;[6](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-is-hypochlorhydria)

 **Surgical Procedures** 

Certain operations, particularly gastric bypass surgery, can reduce acid production capacity &nbsp;[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322491) &nbsp;[7](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypochlorhydria)

 **Lifestyle Factors** 

* Smoking

* Alcohol consumption

* Eating too quickly &nbsp;[5](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-increase-stomach-acid) &nbsp;[6](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-is-hypochlorhydria)

 **Autoimmune Conditions** 

Conditions that damage stomach acid-producing cells, including autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia &nbsp;[9](https://thefunctionalgutclinic.com/blog/news/low-stomach-acid-achlorhydria-is-it-real-how-can-we-test-and-how-can-we-treat/) &nbsp;[10](https://www.rupahealth.com/post/low-stomach-acid)

#### How does aging affect stomach acid production? = asked [Perplexity AI Jan 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-reasons-for-decreased-lpF8Mj3sQiionMddRXiO0g)

The relationship between aging and stomach acid production is more complex than traditionally believed:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Normal Acid Production</span>** 

Contrary to common belief,  **aging itself does not significantly decrease stomach acid production**  &nbsp;[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8612992/) &nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9272898/)

Studies show that nearly 90% of elderly people can adequately acidify their gastric contents, even in an unstimulated state &nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9272898/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Contributing Factors</span>** 

 **Atrophic Gastritis** 

The apparent decline in acid secretion among elderly populations is primarily related to a higher prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis, rather than age itself &nbsp;[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8612992/)

 **Digestive Changes** 

The aging digestive system experiences several changes that can affect acid-related processes:

* Slower digestion rates, causing digestive acids to remain in the stomach longer &nbsp;[6](https://midwestdigestivecenter.com/patient-education/aging-and-acid-reflux/)

* Decreased production of protective stomach juices that shield against harsh digestive acids &nbsp;[6](https://midwestdigestivecenter.com/patient-education/aging-and-acid-reflux/)

* Reduced muscle tone in the lower esophageal sphincter &nbsp;[4](https://www.shawlmd.com/blog/4-reasons-acid-reflux-can-worsen-as-you-age)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Clinical Implications</span>** 

While aging alone may not reduce acid production, older adults are more susceptible to:

* Bacterial overgrowth due to medication-induced hypochlorhydria &nbsp;[5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9692707/)

* Increased sensitivity to medications affecting stomach acid &nbsp;[8](https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/aging-and-digestive-health-6-factors-watch)

* Greater risk of complications from acid-related conditions &nbsp;[6](https://midwestdigestivecenter.com/patient-education/aging-and-acid-reflux/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Risk Factors</span>** 

Elderly individuals may experience decreased acid production due to:

* Use of acid-reducing medications like PPIs and antacids &nbsp;[9](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypochlorhydria)

* Higher prevalence of H. pylori infections &nbsp;[9](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypochlorhydria)

* Chronic stress effects on the digestive system &nbsp;[9](https://www.healthline.com/health/hypochlorhydria)
