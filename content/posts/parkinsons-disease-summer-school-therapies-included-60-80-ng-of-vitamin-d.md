#### [The Top Things I Learned in Parkinson’s Summer School](https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2019/09/03/top-six-parkinsons-summer-school/)

$5,000 for 1 week conference/summer school

Laurie K. Mischley, a naturopathic doctor, assembled approximately 60 people with Parkinson’s for a conference at Bastyr University’s Seattle campus in August. The six-day “summer school” included lectures, exercise classes, and nutrition advice designed to improve each patient’s experience with Parkinson’s and possibly slow progression

 **3. Disease progression may be slowed with some supplements** 

Mischley recommends the following to potentially slow disease progression:

Glutathione: intranasal is better than capsules, but much more expensive;

CoQ10: has mitochondrial/cellular protection properties;

Turmeric/curcumin: curcumin exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and may be neuroprotective;

DHA: has anti-inflammatory properties.

 **4. Absorption of nutrients and medications is important** 

Just taking medications and vitamins is not enough. The body must properly absorb them. Even though I was taking a lot of supplements (B, D, omega-3 fatty acids), my lab results showed that I was deficient in these substances, which may indicate that my body is not properly absorbing them. I have always felt that the carbidopa/levodopa (C/L) I was taking did not really help my symptoms. Perhaps my body was not absorbing that medication properly, either.

A suggested way to optimize C/L absorption is to take nonbuffered vitamin C, such as Emergen-C, with medication. CDP-choline  and a digestive enzyme supplement were also recommended to possibly improve nutrient and medication absorption.

 **5. People with Parkinson’s typically show common nutrient deficiencies** 

Through her research, Mischley has found that there is some commonality in out-of-range lab test results among people with Parkinson’s:

 **vitamin D* (Mischley recommends maintaining a level between 60 and 80 ng/ml, which is higher than the common reference range of 20-50 ng/ml.)** 

homocysteine*

high-sensitivity C-reactive protein*

EPA/DHA (omega-3 fatty acids)*

arachidonic acid* (The ratio of EPA omega-3s must be in line with this value.)

HbA1c*

uric acid

serum B12* 

* I was out of range in these areas
