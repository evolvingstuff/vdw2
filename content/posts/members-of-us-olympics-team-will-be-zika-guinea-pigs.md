#### [National Institute of Health Funded Study](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-funds-zika-virus-study-involving-us-olympic-team%20) July 5, 2016

[The $302,000 study](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9265224&icde=30176861%20) will track 1,000 members of the US Olympics team. &nbsp; &nbsp;[Description of the study](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9265224&icde=30176861)

 **Study may report on such things as:** 

* How many become infected

* How long the infection lasts in urine, semen, etc.

* How many of the infections result in birth defects

* Which types of birth defects: microcephaly, blind, poor muscle tone, etc.

No attempt, of course, at preventing the Zika bites.

The study will just report.

 **Note: indoor athletes have much lower vitamin D levels than outdoor athletes.** 

VitaminDWiki hypothesis is that people with lower levels of vitamin D are more likely to become symptomatic if infected with Zika

Prediction - there will be more indoor than outdoor  infected athletes

Examples: badmitton, basketball, gymnastics, fencing, handball, judo, table tennis, wrestling,
