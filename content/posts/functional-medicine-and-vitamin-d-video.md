Slides of vitamin D information with voice-over

Apparently much of it was from his recent book

[optimal health research](http://optimalhealthresearch.com/) Dr. Alex Vasquez

Brings a lot of stuff I knew about together in one place so you get a better overall view.

Hope people take the time to follow it through.
