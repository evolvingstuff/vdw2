#### [Monitoring the vitamin D package measure](https://english.zorginstituutnederland.nl/publications/reports/2023/12/01/monitoring-the-vitamin-d-package-measure)

* "...discontinue the reimbursement of all vitamin D products containing cholecalciferol or calcifediol from 1 January 2023"

 **People belong to this vulnerable group if they have at least 1 of these characteristics. %%%This was selected because people often have more than 1 issue.** 

people with difficulty keeping oversight of their medicines;

people with osteoporosis;

people with a language barrier or an immigration background;

people with a low level of education;

people with low socio-economic status;

people with generally ill health;

people with limited health literacy;

people with low-level literacy.

 **Study results: most people continued taking vitamin D%%%The study shows that a large proportion of vulnerable people have continued to take vitamin D:** 

* 65% continued to use vitamin D and now pay for it themselves. The main reason is that people consider vitamin D necessary for their health. 

* 5% stopped taking vitamin D. Half of them say they stopped because they cannot afford it. 

* 20% still had a supply of vitamin D and continued to use it. Of this group, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

* 70% say they will continue taking vitamin D when they run out of supply. 

  * 6 to 7% say they will stop.

* The remaining 10% did not enter any useful information.

* The study also shows that patient compliance in vulnerable vitamin D users is not optimal in 2023: some people take less vitamin D than they should. However, that was already the case in 2022, meaning that patient compliance has not changed as a result of the package measure. 

 **Patient compliance is not optimal** 

" **Almost half of the people using it forget to take it and part of them consciously takes it differently.** 

 **Half of the stoppers indicate they cannot afford the product** 

About 5% of the vulnerable group report that they have stopped taking vitamin D, half of them because they cannot afford it.

• If this is extrapolated to the Dutch situation, it affects about 25,000 vulnerable people who are forgoing vitamin D because of the costs (available over the counter from less than 10 euros per person per year).

 <span style="color:orange;"> **Note by VitaminDWiki: 50,000 IU pill every two weeks would cost <5 euros/person/year %%%AND there would be 13 fewer occasions to forget to take it** </span>

*&quot;...discontinue the reimbursement of all vitamin D products containing cholecalciferol or calcifediol from 1 January 2023&quot;
__People belong to this vulnerable group if they have at least 1 of these characteristics. %%%This was selected because people often have more than 1 issue.__
people with difficulty keeping oversight of their medicines;
people with osteoporosis;
people with a language barrier or an immigration background;
people with a low level of education;
people with low socio-economic status;
people with generally ill health;
people with limited health literacy;
people with low-level literacy.

__Study results: most people continued taking vitamin D%%%The study shows that a large proportion of vulnerable people have continued to take vitamin D:__
*65% continued to use vitamin D and now pay for it themselves. The main reason is that people consider vitamin D necessary for their health. 
*5% stopped taking vitamin D. Half of them say they stopped because they cannot afford it. 
*20% still had a supply of vitamin D and continued to use it. Of this group, 
+
*70% say they will continue taking vitamin D when they run out of supply. 
**6 to 7% say they will stop.
*The remaining 10% did not enter any useful information.
*The study also shows that patient compliance in vulnerable vitamin D users is not optimal in 2023: some people take less vitamin D than they should. However, that was already the case in 2022, meaning that patient compliance has not changed as a result of the package measure. 
__Patient compliance is not optimal__
&quot;__Almost half of the people using it forget to take it and part of them consciously takes it differently.__
__Half of the stoppers indicate they cannot afford the product__
About 5% of the vulnerable group report that they have stopped taking vitamin D, half of them because they cannot afford it.
• If this is extrapolated to the Dutch situation, it affects about 25,000 vulnerable people who are forgoing vitamin D because of the costs (available over the counter from less than 10 euros per person per year).
~~#00F:__Note by VitaminDWiki: 50,000 IU pill every two weeks would cost &lt;5 euros/person/year %%%AND there would be 13 fewer occasions to forget to take it__~~
