#### Efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on child and adolescent overweight/obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials

The global prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents has been increasing. Child and adolescent overweight/obesity has been demonstrated to be partially associated with vitamin D deficiency. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on child and adolescent overweight/obesity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science were searched from inception to June 20th, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of vitamin D on child and adolescent overweight/obesity were included. The Cochrane bias risk assessment tool was used to assess the bias risk of included studies, and subgroup analysis was conducted based on different administration dosages. All data-analyses were performed using R 4.2.1. 

There were 1502 articles retrieved, and 10 eligible studies were finally included, with a total of 595 participants.

Meta-analysis showed no differences in LDL, TC, TG, BMI, ALP, Ca, and PTH between vitamin-D (Vit-D) group and placebo, 

while Vit-D group resulted in improved HOMA-IR<span>[WMD =  - 0.348, 95%CI (- 0.477, - 0.219), p = 0.26]</span>. S

ubgroup-analysis showed no significant difference in the increase of 25-(OH)-D between subgroups (p = 0.39), whereas the serum 25-(OH)-D level was increased under different Vit-D doses <span>[WMD = 6.973, 95%CI (3.072, 10.873)]</span>. 

High daily dose (= 4000 IU/d) of Vit-D might decrease CRP and increase HDL levels.

Conclusion: High dose of Vit-D supplementation (over 4000 IU/d) would reduce several cardiometabolic risk indicators and improve insulin resistance. More high-quality and large-scale RCTs are needed to provide more robust evidence.
