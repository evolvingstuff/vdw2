* "One-third of the drugs approved from 2001 to 2010 were found to have major safety issues years after approval,,,"

* "The F.D.A. was once criticized for taking too long to approve drugs, but now it is much quicker to approve drugs than its European counterpart."

* "Part of the story may be the conflicts of interest baked into the structure of the F.D.A. In 1992, Congress allowed the agency to collect fees from the industry it oversees to pay for the high costs of drug approvals. These fees pay for much of the salaries of F.D.A. review workers responsible for the approval of new drugs."

* “You don’t survive as a senior official at the F.D.A. unless you’re pro-industry,”

* "And there is a lucrative reason to try to make it as a senior official at the F.D.A.: It could lead to a cushy second career as a consultant to the drug industry"

* "Between 2001 and 2010, according to one study, 26 F.D.A. reviewers who worked on cancer and hematology drugs left the agency; more than half of them went on to work or consult for the drug industry. Scott Gottlieb, who ran the agency from 2017 to 2019, is now on the board of directors of Pfizer."

* Oxytoxin killed nearly 500,000 Americans

   * "...Curtis Wright, the F.D.A. official who oversaw the process for OxyContin’s review"

   * "...it could seem that Wright had given up his role as impartial federal regulator and become a sort of in-house advocate for Purdue.” 

   * "Within two years of leaving the agency, Wright went to work for Purdue."
