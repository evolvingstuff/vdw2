Lower circulating vitamin D is common in older adults and may be a potential reversible risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older adults, however, presented controversial results.Database was searched update to February 2018. Key data were extracted from eligible studies. Dose-response meta-analysis were conducted for synthesizing data from eligible studies.A total of 13 eligible studies involving 21,079 participants were included in this meta-analysis. 

Person with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (25 (OH)D level <50 nmol/L) appeared to have higher mortality of CVD in older adults ( **RR = 1.54** , 95% CI 1.24-1.91).

Furthermore, a significantly higher mortality of CVD in older adults was observed for the 

* deficient (<25 nmol/L; RR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.81) and 

* nsufficient (25-50 nmol/L; RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.27) categories of 25 (OH)D, 

compared to the reference category of >75 nmol/L. 

Additionally, decrease of 10 nmol/L 25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with a 7% incremental in the risk of CVD mortality in older adults.Considering these promising results, circulating vitamin D is associated with CVD mortality increment in older adults.

#### Vitamin D is as good as conventional drugs at treating Chronic Heart Failure Meta-analysis Jan 2016

 **Vitamin D Supplementation in the Treatment of Chronic Heart Failure: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials** 

Clin Cardiol. 2016 Jan;39(1):56-61. [doi: 10.1002/clc.22473.](https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.22473.) Epub 2015 Sep 28.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with the development and progression of chronic heart failure (CHF).

HYPOTHESIS:  Additional supplementation of vitamin D may have protective effects in patients with CHF.

METHODS:

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases through June 2015 and included 7 randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CHF. Then, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to confirm whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in CHF patients. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models.

RESULTS:

Our pooled results indicated that additional supplementation of vitamin D was not superior to conventional treatment in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and 6-minute walk distance. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation was associated with significant decreases in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (WMD: -2.42 pg/mL, 95% CI: -4.26 to -0.57, P < 0.05), C-reactive protein (WMD: -0.72 mg/L, 95% CI: -1.42 to -0.02, P < 0.05), and parathyroid hormone (WMD: -13.44 pg/mL, 95% CI: -21.22 to -5.67, P < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may decrease serum levels of parathyroid hormone and inflammatory mediators in CHF patients, whereas it has no beneficial effects on improvement of left ventricular function and exercise tolerance.

#### Vitamin D helps remodeling after HF - meta-analysis Aug 2018

 **Effect of vitamin D on ventricular remodelling in heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.** 

BMJ Open. 2018 Aug 30;8(8):e020545. [doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020545.](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020545.)

OBJECTIVES: The level of vitamin D is considered to be associated with the development and progression of heart failure (HF). However, it is still unclear whether supplementation of vitamin D could improve ventricular remodelling in patients with HF. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the influence and safety of additional vitamin D supplementation on ventricular remodelling in patients with HF.

DESIGN: This study is a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

SETTING: The PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Cochrane library, Web of Science databases and grey literature were searched for RCTs regarding the effect of vitamin D on ventricular remodelling in patients with HF (from database creation to October 2017). RevMan V.5.3 software was employed for data analysis.

PARTICIPANTS: Seven RCTs with a total of 465 patients, including 235 cases in the vitamin D group and 230 cases in the control group, were included.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the incidence of adverse reactions.

RESULTS:

Compared with the control group, a decrease in the LVEDD (mean difference (MD)=-2.31 mm, 95% CI -4.15 to -0.47, p=0.01) and an increase in the LVEF (MD=4.18%, 95% CI 0.36 to 7.99, p=0.03) were observed in the vitamin D group. Subgroup analysis also revealed a reduced LVEDD in adults (>18 years) and adolescents (<18 years) of the vitamin D group relative to that in those of the control group. High-dose vitamin D (>4000 IU/day) was more effective at reducing the LVEDD than low-dose vitamin D (<4000 IU/day). Moreover, vitamin D supplementation was more effective at reducing the LVEDD and increasing the LVEF in patients with reduced ejection fraction than in patients without reduced ejection fraction.

CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation inhibits ventricular remodelling and improves cardiac function in patients with HF.
