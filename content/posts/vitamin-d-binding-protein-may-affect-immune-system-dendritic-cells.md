#### Transcriptomic analysis reveal the responses of dendritic cells to VDBP

Genes Genomics. 2022 Mar 12. [doi: 10.1007/s13258-022-01234-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13258-022-01234-z) (behind $40 paywall)

Background: Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) is an essential plasma carrier protein, which plays possible roles in reproductive health, disease and so on. However, the effects of VDBP on immunity have not been fully studied and the pertinent literatures remain very limited.

Objective: In this study, we introduced the exogenous VDBP into DC2.4 and established a stable DC2.4/VDBP cell line to explore the role of this gene in immunity.

Methods: Dendritic cells (DCs), as the most effective antigen presenting cells (APC) found so far, are directly involved in regulating some innate immunity. In order to evaluate the biological role of VDBP in DCs, we stably overexpressed VDBP in DCs, and conducted Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8 kit) and flow cytometry to detect changes in cell function. CCK-8 kit was used to monitor the viability of DCs after gene overexpression, and flow cytometry was used to detect changes in cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Subsequently, in order to reveal the mechanism of VDBP regulating DCs, we adopted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

Results: CCK-8 results revealed VDBP successfully inhibited viability of DCs. Besides, we found that overexpression of this gene greatly promoted apoptosis and obviously altered the cell cycle distribution of DCs in G1 and G2 phases. Moreover, RNA-seq was carried out and 151 differently expression genes (DEGs) were obtained. In addition, gene differential expression analysis showed that most of them were uniformly enriched in immunity-related pathways.

Conclusion: These results indicated that VDBP greatly repressed proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and changed cell cycle in DCs via altering the expression levels of gene associated with their cellular immunity.

>  **Abstract**  Although being discovered in 1959, the number of published papers in recent years reveals that vitamin D binding protein (DBP), a member of the albuminoid superfamily, is a hot research topic. Besides the three major phenotypes (DBP1F, DBP1S and DBP2), more than 120 unique variants have been described of this polymorphic protein. The presence of DBP has been demonstrated in different body fluids (serum, urine, breast milk, ascitic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva and seminal fluid) and organs (brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, placenta, spleen, testes and uterus). Although the major function is binding, solubilization and transport of vitamin D and its metabolites, the name of this glycoprotein hides numerous other important biological functions. In this review, we will focus on the analytical aspects of the determination of DBP and discuss in detail the multifunctional capacity <span>[actin scavenging, binding of fatty acids, chemotaxis, binding of endotoxins, influence on T cell response and influence of vitamin D binding protein-macrophage activating factor (DBP-MAF) on bone metabolism and cancer]</span> of this abundant plasma protein.
