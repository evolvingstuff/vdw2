Chronic pruritus is a distressing condition that significantly impacts patientsâ€™ quality of life. Recent research has increasingly focused on the potential role of vitamin D, given its immunomodulatory properties, in managing this condition. This meta-analysis seeks to systematically assess the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in alleviating chronic pruritus across diverse clinical contexts. We conducted an extensive search through multiple databases, covering literature up to July 2024, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of vitamin D on chronic pruritus. Eligible studies were those that provided data on changes in pruritus severity, as measured by standardized tools, before and after vitamin D treatment. The data were synthesized using a random-effects model to address variability among the studies. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024579353). The findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a significant reduction in pruritus severity, the skin lesion area, and levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), compared to controls. These results suggest that vitamin D could be a promising therapeutic option for chronic pruritus, though further rigorous studies are required to validate these findings and to elucidate the mechanisms involved.

#### Might topical vitamin D treat chronic pruritus?

 **[Perplexity AI Nov 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/might-topical-vitamin-d-treat-kVds.9HfRQqB3ZHKjBu.Fw)** 

Topical vitamin D shows significant promise as a treatment for chronic pruritus (itching) across multiple conditions. The therapeutic effects are particularly notable in several key areas:

 **Effectiveness** 

 **Clinical Improvement** 

Topical vitamin D application demonstrates significant reduction in pruritus severity compared to placebo treatments&nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

The treatment shows particularly strong results when applied for less than 8 weeks, with patients experiencing substantial itch relief&nbsp; [2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

 **Specific Conditions** 

The treatment has proven effective for several pruritus-related conditions:

* Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) &nbsp;[1](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-topical-vitamin-d-ease-ckd-associated.html)&nbsp;[6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25916632/)

* Psoriasis&nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

* Urticaria (hives)&nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

* Polymorphic light eruption&nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

 **Treatment Mechanisms** 

Topical vitamin D works through multiple pathways:

* Improves skin dryness and scaling &nbsp;[1](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-topical-vitamin-d-ease-ckd-associated.html)

* Reduces inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-6, and hs-CRP&nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

* Decreases skin lesion area&nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

 **Safety Profile** 

The treatment is generally well-tolerated, with studies reporting no clinically significant side effects during the treatment period&nbsp;[1](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-topical-vitamin-d-ease-ckd-associated.html)&nbsp;[6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25916632/)

This favorable safety profile makes it a promising therapeutic option for chronic pruritus management.

 **Administration** 

Topical application of vitamin D shows more pronounced relief from pruritus compared to oral supplementation &nbsp;[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9983)

Treatment typically involves twice-daily application, with improvements observable within the first few weeks of use&nbsp;[6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25916632/)

#### The founder of VitaminDWiki uses a topical Vitamin D for all of his skin concerns

Psorasis (from a bike injury), warts, wounds, <a href="/posts/shingles-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Shingles and vitamin D">shingles</a>, etc.

Each were treated by just a few drops of topical vitamin D 3 times a day for several day

[Nutrasal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESKNGCW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1?tag=vdw-20) claims 10X more bio-availabity than its competition

Vitamin D cream would probably work as well - many products on Amazon

Bentonite clay and EMU oil are also great for itritated skin - many products on Amazon
