 **This study used just a small injection of Vitamin D** 

 **Suspect they injected regular vitamin D into muscle or fat tissue** 

 **Expect faster response from injecting semiactivated or fully activated Vitamin D into the blood** 

 **100,000 IU of Vitamin D will raise the blood level a little bit** 

 **[Loading doses](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) of 400,000 and 600,000 IU of Vitamin D have been used >1 million times** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the way - I take 100,000 IU of vitamin D every 4 days (founder of VitaminDWiki May 2019)
