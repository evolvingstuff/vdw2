#### Bone loss during breastfeeding reduced by 6,400 IU of vitamin D daily - June 2024

Factors Affecting Postpartum Bone Mineral Density in a Clinical Trial of Vitamin D Supplementation

Background: Few studies evaluate the effects of vitamin D status and supplementation on maternal bone mineral density (BMD) during lactation and further lack inclusion of diverse racial/ethnic groups, body mass index (BMI), or physical activity. Objective: Determine the effects of vitamin D treatment/status, feeding type, BMI, race/ethnicity, and physical activity on postpartum women's BMD to 7 months. 

Methods: Women with singleton pregnancies beginning 4-6 weeks' postpartum were randomized into two treatment groups (400 or 6400 IU vitamin D/day). Participant hip, spine, femoral neck, and whole-body BMD using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA Hologic), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[2[5(OH)D]</span> (RIA; Diasorin), BMI, and physical activity were measured at 1, 4, and 7 months postpartum. A general linear mixed modeling approach was undertaken to assess the effects of vitamin D status <span>[both serum 25(OH)D concentrations and treatment groups]</span>, feeding type, race/ethnicity, BMI, and physical activity on BMD in postpartum women. 

Results: During the 6-month study period, lactating women had 1-3% BMD loss in all regions compared with 1-3% gain in nonlactating women. Higher maternal BMI was associated with less bone loss in femoral neck and hip regions. Black American women had less BMD loss than White/Caucasian or Hispanic lactating women in spine and hip regions. Exclusively breastfeeding women in the 6400 IU vitamin D group had less femoral neck BMD loss than the 400 IU group at 4 months sustained to 7 months. Physical activity was associated with higher hip BMD.

Conclusion: While there was BMD loss during lactation to 7 months, the loss rate was less than previously reported, with notable racial/ethnic variation. Breastfeeding was associated with loss in BMD compared with formula-feeding women who gained BMD. Higher BMI and physical activity independently appeared to protect hip BMD, whereas higher vitamin D supplementation appeared protective against femoral neck BMD loss.
