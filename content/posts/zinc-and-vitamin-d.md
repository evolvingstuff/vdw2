#### Zinc supplementation increased weight, height etc, of children - meta-analysis Oct 2023

 **The effect of zinc supplementation on anthropometric measurements in healthy children over two years: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Meta-Analysis BMC Pediatr . 2023 Aug 23;23(1):414. [doi: 10.1186/s12887-023-04249-x.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-023-04249-x.)

 **Small amount of Zinc increased weight** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/zinc-increased-weight.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

Background: Zinc deficiency is one of the most important micronutrient deficiencies in children that can affect the children's growth pattern. In this regard, different studies were conducted to assess the effect of zinc supplementation on growth patterns in healthy children. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has summarized the results of these studies. So, in the present study, we systematically reviewed the result of the studies that assessed the effect of zinc supplementation on anthropometric parameters in healthy, over 2-year-old children.

Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to November 2021. Data were pooled using the random-effects method and were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results: The pooled results of eight studies, including 1586 participants, showed that zinc supplementation significantly increases 

* height <span>[(WMD): 0.9, 95% CI: (0.27, 1.52), p < 0.001]</span>, 

* weight <span>[(WMD): 0.51, 95% CI: (0.06, 0.97), p < 0.001]</span>, 

* height for age (HAZ) <span>[(WMD): 0.07, 95% CI: (0.03, 0.10), p < 0.001]</span>. 

Also, meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant association between dose and duration of intervention and anthropometric parameters.

Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the beneficial effects of zinc supplementation on weight, height, and HAZ.

The purpose of the present clinical trial was to determine the impact of zinc supplementation on serum liver enzymes, steatosis severity, lipid profile, and inflammatory status in overweight or obese children with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This randomized controlled trial was conducted by enrolling 60 children with NASH, aged 10–18 years old. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups that received either 30 mg/day of elemental zinc or placebo for 16 weeks. The severity of liver steatosis was evaluated using liver ultrasonography. Fasting blood samples were collected from each patient at the beginning and after 16 weeks of intervention to measure biochemical parameters. Following a  **16-week intervention** , zinc supplementation compared with placebo significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and considerably enhanced HDL-cholesterol values. However, zinc intake had no considerable impact on aspartate aminotransferase, the severity of liver steatosis, anthropometric parameters, and other lipid indices versus the placebo group. 

Overall, zinc supplementation showed a promising impact on serum ALT, HDL-cholesterol, and inflammatory status in overweight or obese children suffering from NASH. Zinc supplementation may be a new strategy for the amelioration of NASH in overweight or obese children. This trial has been registered on the Iranian website for registration of clinical trials with the special ID of IRCT20200531047614N1

#### Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review - Dec 2022

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/zinc-and-prostate-cancer.jpg" alt="image" width="900">

Introduction-With the high global prevalence of prostate cancer and associated mortalities, it is important to enhance current clinical practices for better prostate cancer outcomes. The current review is towards understanding the value of Zn towards this mission. Method-General information on Zn in biology and multiple aspects of Zn involvement in prostate health and disease were referred to in PubMed. 

Results-The most influential feature of Zn towards prostate health is its ability to retain sufficient citrate levels for a healthy prostate. Zn deficiencies were recorded in serum, hair, and prostate tissue of men with prostate cancer compared to non-cancer controls. Zn gut absorption, albumin binding, and storage compete with various factors. There are multiple associations of Zn cellular influx and efflux transporters, Zn finger proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, and Zn signaling with prostate cancer outcomes. Such Zn marker variations associated with prostate cancer recorded from biological matrices may improve algorithms for prostate cancer screening, prognosis, and management when coupled with standard clinical practices. 

Discussion-The influence of Zn in prostatic health and disease is multidimensional, therefore more personalized Zn requirements may be beneficial. Several opportunities exist to utilize and improve understanding of Zn associations with prostate health and disease.

Zinc’s intestinal uptake is hindered by other minerals, including Calcium, Magnesium, and Iron, since they all use the same transporter. If the transporter’s uptake limit (800mg) is exceeding between these four minerals, absorption rates will fall. Taking less than 800mg of these four minerals at the same time is fine."

Zn is an essential trace element for all organisms. In human subjects body growth and development is strictly dependent on Zn. The nervous, reproductive and immune systems are particularly influenced by Zn deficiency, as well as by increased levels of Zn. The relationship between Zn and the immune system is complex, since there are four different types of influence associated with Zn. 

* (1) The dietary intake and the resorption of Zn depends on the composition of the diet and also on age and disease status. 

* (2) Zn is a cofactor in more than 300 enzymes influencing various organ functions having a secondary effect on the immune system.

* (3) Direct effects of Zn on the production, maturation and function of leucocytes. 

* (4) Zn influences the function of immunostimulants used in the experimental systems. 

Here we summarize all four types of influence on the immune function. Nutritional aspects of Zn, the physiology of Zn, the influence of Zn on enzymes and cellular functions, direct effects of Zn on leucocytes at the cellular and molecular level, Zn-altered function of immunostimulants and the therapeutic use of Zn will be discussed in detail.

#### 8 major uses of Zinc in the body - 2014

 **[Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140718114541.htm)  reporting on a 2014 study** 

* Brain: The blood zinc level is less in patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Brewer, and others 2010).In a rodent study, it was observed that zinc behaves like an antidepressant (Nowak and others, 2005).

* Cardiovascular System: Zinc performs a noteworthy role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure. Males and females were reported to metabolize zinc differently when suffering from hypertension (Tubek, 2007).

* Liver: Zinc deficiency in the liver occurs not only in those with liver cirrhosis, but also in less advanced alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease (Bode and others, 1998).

* Pregnancy: A mild deficiency of zinc during a pregnancy can cause increased maternal morbidity, abnormal taste sensation, prolonged gestation, inefficient labor, atonic bleeding, and an increased risk to fetuses (Jameson, 1993).

* Diabetes: Zinc is very important in the synthesis, storage, and secretion of insulin (Chausmer 1998). A low level of zinc has been shown to play a role in diabetics with associated disease conditions such as coronary artery disease and several related risk factors including hypertension, and elevated levels of triglycerides (Singh and others, 1998).

* Endocrine System: Studies show a correlation between zinc deficiency in geriatric patients and reduced activity of the thymus gland and thymic hormones, decreased response to vaccinations, and reduced  **immunity**  (Haase and Rink, 2009).

* Healing: Zinc deficiency has been linked with delayed wound healing, and has been found to be crucial to the healing of gastric ulcers especially at the early stage (Kennan and Morris, 1993; Andrews and Gallagher-Allred, 1999; Watanabe, 1995).

* Pneumonia: Zinc may shorten the duration of severe pneumonia and time in the hospital (Brooks, 2004).

#### Zinc and its role in Vitamin D function - April 2022

Current Research in Physiology, Volume 5, 2022, Pages 203-207 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crphys.2022.04.001

Zinc is an essential mineral with an important relationship with vitamin D. Studies have found that reduced blood zinc levels could predict vitamin D deficiency in adolescent girls, while zinc supplementation increased vitamin D levels in postmenopausal women. In vitro studies using human peritoneal macrophages have found that zinc induced the release of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). Zinc also acts as a cofactor for vitamin D functions, as the transcriptional activity of vitamin D-dependent genes relies on zinc to exert pleiotropic functions, including mineral ion regulation. Vitamin D could also induce zinc transporters to regulate zinc homeostasis. Together, zinc and vitamin D in adequate concentrations help maintain a healthy musculoskeletal system and beyond; however, deficiency in either of these nutrients can result in various disorders affecting almost all body systems. This brief article will focus on the role of zinc in vitamin D functions.

 **[WHO](https://www.who.int/whr/2002/chapter4/en/index3.html) as of 2018** 

* "Using food availability data, it is estimated that zinc deficiency affects about one-third of the world's population, with estimates ranging from 4% to 73% across subregions"

* "Worldwide, zinc deficiency is responsible for approximately 16% of lower respiratory tract infections, 18% of malaria and 10% of diarrhoeal disease"

* "Attributable DALYs were higher, with zinc deficiency accounting for about 2.9% of worldwide loss of healthy life years"

 **How To Test for Zinc** 

There are several ways to test zinc levels. One that I am a fan of due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness is the zinc sulfate taste test. All you do is purchase a bottle of zinc sulfate liquid (this a good one), place a capful in your mouth, and observe the sensations in your mouth.

 **Below are the possible outcomes and indications:** 

* You Notice No Metallic Taste: Zinc Deficiency

* You Notice A Delayed Metallic Taste: Slight Zinc Deficiency

* You Notice Slight Metallic Taste: Zinc Levels Are Adequate, But Could Be Higher

* You Notice Very Strong Metallic Taste: You Likely Have Optimal Zinc Levels

#### Cochraine Review - Zinc treats colds

 **[2013](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001364.pub4/abstract?utm_source=Cold+and+Flu+Season+is+Approaching+%28Part+4%29+-+Fri+10%2F11&utm_campaign=Newsletter&utm_medium=email) with free PDF** 

Zinc administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy people but some caution is needed due to the heterogeneity of the data. As the zinc lozenges formulation has been widely studied and there is a significant reduction in the duration of cold at a dose of ≥ 75 mg/day, for those considering using zinc it would be best to use it at this dose throughout the cold. Regarding prophylactic zinc supplementation, currently no firm recommendation can be made because of insufficient data. When using zinc lozenges (not as syrup or tablets) the likely benefit has to be balanced against side effects, notably a bad taste and nausea.

Background and objectives: Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25OHD) has a key role in the pathogenesis of several chronic disorders. Vitamin D deficiency is a common global public health problem. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency using a decision tree algorithm.

Methods: A total of 988 adolescent girls, aged 12-18 years old, were recruited to the study. Demographic characteristics, serum biochemical factors, all blood count parameters and trace elements such as Zinc, Copper, Calcium and SOD were measured. Serum levels of vitamin D below 20 ng/ml were considered to be deficiency. 70% of these girls (618 cases) were randomly allocated to a training dataset for the constructing of the decision-tree. The remaining 30% (285 cases) were used as the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of decision-tree.

In this model, 14 input variables were included: age, academic attainment of their father, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio,  **zinc** , copper, calcium, SOD, FBG, HDL-C, RBC, MCV, MCHC, HCT. The validation of the model was assessed by constructing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Results: The results showed that serum Zn concentration was the most important associated risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values were 79.3%, 64%, 77.8% and 0.72 respectively using the testing dataset.

Conclusions: The results suggest that the serum levels of Zn is an important associated risk factor for identifying subjects with vitamin D deficiency among Iranian adolescent girls.
