Introduction: There is little information about low vitamin D concentrations in apparently healthy  **indigenous children**  in South America.

Objectives:

* (a) To compare the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in SAC (San Antonio de los Cobres) versus BA (Buenos Aires) boys and 

* (b) to determine the association of serum vitamin D concentration with age, gender, and risk factors for diabetes.

Methods: This cross-sectional study compares 129 boys from SAC with a 98% indigenous population, versus 116 boys from BA with a mixed population. Anthropometric measures and serum levels of glucose, lipids, insulin, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> were measured in May 2011 and May 2010 (fall season). Optimal, insufficiency, deficiency, and severe deficiency of vitamin D were defined as [25(OH)D[levels ≥ 75 nmol/L, 50 to < 75 nmol/L, 25 to < 50 nmol/L, and < 25 nmol/L respectively.

Results: The mean age was 9.7 ± 2.7 in SAC and 11.3 ± 2.51 years in BA children. Seventeen (13.2%) SAC and 2 (1.7%) BA children were underweight; 99 (76.7%) SAC and 58 (50.0%) BA children were normal weight; 5 (3.9%) SAC and 15 (12.9%) BA children were overweight; and 8 (6.2%) SAC and 41 (35.3%) BA children were obese (p < 0.001). Sixty-six (51.2%) SAC and 1 (0.9%) BA children had vitamin D severe deficiency; 58 (45.0%) SAC and 53 (45.7%) BA children had deficiency; 5 (3.9%) SAC and 61 (52.6%) BA had insufficiency; and 0 (0%) SAC and 1 (0.9%) BA children had optimal vitamin D (p < 0.001). Therefore, there was a lower prevalence of overweight/obesity and a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in SAC than in BA children. Separate linear regression models showed an inverse association between glucose levels (beta = − 0.22; p = 0.01) and HOMA = IR (beta = − 0.21; p = 0.02) with vitamin D levels adjusted for age, z-BMI and community.

Conclusions: There was a higher prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency in SAC versus BA boys, suggesting that  **dark skin** , high altitudes, or genetic backgrounds could contribute to this problem. In addition, we found an inverse association between [25(OH)D](25(OH)D[levels%20≥%2075%20nmol/L,%2050%20to%20<%2075%20nmol/L,%2025%20to%20<%2050%20nmol/L,%20and%20<%2025%20nmol/L%20respectively.

### Highlights

* Indian children had healthier lifestyle behaviors than urban children.

* Indian children had lower vitamin D concentrations and higher prevalence of severe deficiency. 

* There was a clear inverse association between vitamin D and both HOMA-IR and glucose levels in Indian and urban children

#### Observation: Much less vitamin D from the sun with dark skin, even though closer to the equator and at a higher altitude
