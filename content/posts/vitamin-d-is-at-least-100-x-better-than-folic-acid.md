#### Summary Vitamin D vs Folic Acid

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supplement | Number needed to treat<br>(Eliminate one birth problem) | Lifetime cost<br> of each problem | Total costs saved<br>for 2,000 pregnancies |
| Folic acid  |  **NNT = 2000**  - Spina bifida | [$700,000](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/data.html) | $700,000 |
| Vitamin D  |  **NNT = 20**  - Premature birth | [$700,000](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2431-14-93),  &nbsp; &nbsp;  [Ref2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11391/) | 70,000,000 <br> just preterm births |

 **100 X fewer people need to take Vitamin D than Folic acid to eliminate a $700,000 lifetime risk  
And, Vitamin D eliminates far more risks/costs than just preterm birth**

#### Recommendation (Folate NOT FOLIC ACID) - starting 12 weeks before conception

~~#00F:1) Take 400 ug of FOLATE (not folic acid) daily thru 8th week of pregnancy

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not continue taking Folate after 8th week, there is a 3.2X risk of breast cancer if high Folate in blood

2) Take at least 4,000 IU of Vitamin D daily for the rest of life, but especially thru breastfeeding

&nbsp; &nbsp; (Use a vitamin D loading dose if had not supplemented before pregnancy)~~
