A recent systematic review indicates that food sensitization in early childhood is a risk factor, not only for food allergies, but also for developing an allergic march which can lead to airway allergic diseases1 . Over the past few decades, many groups have studied risk factors for allergic diseases, including sensitization. These risks include eczema, gut microbiome, timing of introduction of solid food, Vitamin D, etc.
