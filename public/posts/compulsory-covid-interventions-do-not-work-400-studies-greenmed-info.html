We knew that we could never eradicate this mutable virus (that has an animal reservoir) with lockdowns and that it would likely become endemic like other circulating common cold coronaviruses. When we knew an age-risk stratified approach was optimal (focused protection as outlined in the Great Barrington Declaration) and not carte blanche policies when we had evidence of a 1,000-fold differential in risk of death between a child and an elderly person. We knew of the potency and success of  <strong><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33387997/>early ambulatory outpatient treatment</a></strong>  in reducing the risk of hospitalization and death in the vulnerable.</p><p>It was clear very early on that Task Forces and medical advisors and decision-makers were not reading the evidence, were not up to speed with the science or data, did not understand the evidence, did not &lsquo;get&rsquo; the evidence, and were blinded to the science, often driven by their own prejudices, biases, arrogance, and ego. They remain ensconced in sheer academic sloppiness and laziness. It was clear that the response was not a public health one. It was a political one from day one and continues today. </p><p>A  <strong><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34401887/>recent study</a></strong>  (pre-print) captures the essence and catastrophe of a lockdown society and the hollowing out of our children by looking at how children learn (3 months to 3 years old) and finding across all measures that &ldquo;children born during the pandemic have significantly reduced verbal, motor, and overall cognitive performance compared to children born pre-pandemic.&rdquo; Researchers also reported that &ldquo;males and children in lower socioeconomic families have been most affected. Results highlight that even in the absence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness, the environmental changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly and negatively affecting infant and child development.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps  <strong><a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-failed-experiment-of-covid-lockdowns-11599000890>Donald Luskin of the Wall Street Journal</a></strong>  best captures what we have stably witnessed since the start of these unscientific lockdowns and school closures: &ldquo;Six months into the Covid-19 pandemic, the U.S. has now carried out two large-scale experiments in public health first, in March and April, the lockdown of the economy to arrest the spread of the virus, and second, since mid-April, the reopening of the economy. The results are in. Counterintuitive though it may be, statistical analysis shows that locking down the economy didn&rsquo;t contain the disease&rsquo;s spread and reopening it didn&rsquo;t unleash a second wave of infections.&rdquo;-</p><p>The <strong><a href=https://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Info-Site/Documents/Public_health_COVID-19_reports/Impact_School_Closures_COVID-19.pdf>British Columbia Center for Disease Control</a></strong>  (BCCDC) issued a full report in September 2020 on the impact of school closures on children and found para &ldquo;that i) children comprise a small proportion of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, have less severe illness, and mortality is rare ii) children do not appear to be a major source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households or schools, a finding which has been consistent globally iii) there are important differences between how influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted. School closures may be less effective as a prevention measure for COVID-19 iv) school closures can have severe and unintended consequences for children and youth v) school closures contribute to greater family stress, especially for female caregivers, while families balance child care and home learning with employment demands vi) family violence may be on the rise during the COVID pandemic, while the closure of schools and childcare centres may create a gap in the safety net for children who are at risk of abuse and neglect.&rdquo;&ndash;</p><p>Now places like Austria (November 2021) have re-entered the world of lockdown lunacy only to be outmatched by Australia. Indeed, an illustration of the spurious need for these ill-informed actions is that they are being done in the face of clear scientific evidence showing that during strict prior societal lockdowns, school lockdowns, mask mandates, and additional societal restrictions, the number of positive cases went up!&ndash;</p><p>The pandemic response today remains a purely political one.&ndash;</p><p>What follows is the current totality of the body of evidence (available comparative studies and high-level pieces of evidence, reporting, and discussion) on COVID-19 lockdowns, masks, school closures, and mask mandates. There is no conclusive evidence supporting claims that any of these restrictive measures worked to reduce viral transmission or deaths. Lockdowns were ineffective, school closures were ineffective, mask mandates were ineffective, and masks themselves were and are ineffective and harmful. &ndash;</p><p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Evidence showing that COVID-19 lockdowns, use of face masks, school closures, and mask mandates were largely ineffective and caused crushing harms&ndash;</p><nav id=TableOfContents></nav><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><br><strong>Study/report title, author, and year published and interactive url link</strong></td><td><br><strong>Predominant study/evidence report finding</strong></td></tr><tr><td><br>!!!!LOCKDOWNS</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><br><strong>1)</strong>   <strong><a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.20248936v1>Lockdown Effects on Sars-CoV-2 Transmission - The evidence from Northern Jutland</a></strong> , Kepp, 2021</td><td><br>&ldquo;Analysis shows that while infection levels decreased, they did so before lockdown was effective, and infection numbers also decreased in neighbour municipalities without mandates…direct spill-over to neighbour municipalities or the simultaneous mass testing do not explain this…data suggest that efficient infection surveillance and voluntary compliance make full lockdowns unnecessary.&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td><br><strong>2) <a href=https://thefatemperor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1.-LANCET-LOCKDOWN-NO-MORTALITY-BENEFIT-A-country-level-analysis-measuring-the-impact-of-government-actions.pdf>A country level analysis measuring the impact of government actions, country preparedness and socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 mortality and related health outcomes</a></strong> , Chaudhry, 2020</td><td><br>&ldquo;Analysis was conducted to assess the impact of timing and type of national health policy/actions undertaken towards COVID-19 mortality and related health outcomes…low levels of national preparedness, scale of testing and population characteristics were associated with increased national case load and overall mortality….in our analysis, full lockdowns and wide-spread COVID-19 testing were not associated with reductions in the number of critical cases or overall mortality.&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td><br><strong>3) <a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078717v1>Full lockdown policies in Western Europe countries have no evident impacts on the COVID-19 epidemic</a></strong> , Meunier, 2020</td><td><br>&ldquo;Extrapolating pre-lockdown growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the death toll in the absence of any lockdown policies, and show that these strategies might not have saved any life in western Europe.

This then leads to a second wave of infections that can result in more deaths, but later. Further lockdowns would lead to a repeating series of waves of infection unless herd immunity is achieved by <a href=https://www.greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all> <strong>vaccination</strong> </a>, which is not considered in the model. A similar result is obtained in some of the scenarios involving general social distancing.

Several reasons for such an autonomous decline have been suggested. One is that differences in host susceptibility and behavior can result in herd immunity at a relatively low prevalence level. Accounting for individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to the coronavirus yields a maximum of 17% to 20% of the population that needs to be infected to reach herd immunity, an estimate that is empirically supported by the cohort of the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

They have also caused an erosion of fundamental rights and the separation of powers in a large part of the world as both democratic and autocratic regimes have misused their emergency powers and ignored constitutional limits to policy-making (Bjørnskov and Voigt, 2020).

As a result of this approach current policy can be misdirected and with highly negative effects on human welfare. Moreover, such policies can inadvertently result in not minimizing death rates (incorporating externalities) at all, especially in the long run… such misdirected and sub-optimal policy is a product of policy makers using inappropriate mental models which are lacking in a number of key areas; the failure to take a more comprehensive macro perspective to address the virus, using bad heuristics or decision-making tools, relatedly not recognizing the differential effects of the virus, and adopting herding strategy (follow-the-leader) when developing policy.&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td><br><strong>23) <a href=https://www.aier.org/article/the-mystery-of-taiwan/>The Mystery of Taiwan</a>, <a href=https://www.aier.org/staffs/amelia-janaskie/>Janaskie</a></strong> , 2020<br><br><br><br> </td><td><br>&ldquo;Another fascinating outlier - often cited as a case in which a government handled the pandemic the correct way - was Taiwan.

As a result, most of the early cost/benefit studies arrived at conclusions that were refuted later by data, and which rendered their cost/benefit findings incorrect. Research done over the past six months has shown that lockdowns have had, at best, a marginal effect on the number of Covid-19 deaths. Generally speaking, the ineffectiveness of lockdown stems from voluntary changes in behavior. Lockdown jurisdictions were not able to prevent non-compliance, and non-lockdown jurisdictions benefited from voluntary changes in behavior that mimicked lockdowns. The limited effectiveness of lockdowns explains why, after one year, the unconditional cumulative deaths per million, and the pattern of daily deaths per million, is not negatively correlated with the stringency of lockdown across countries. Using a cost/benefit method proposed by Professor Bryan Caplan, and using two extreme assumptions of lockdown effectiveness, the cost/benefit ratio of lockdowns in Canada, in terms of life-years saved, is between 3.6-282.

A similar result is obtained in some of the scenarios involving general social distancing.

The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic…The calculus may be different, however, in health care settings. First and foremost, a mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) clinicians need when caring for symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infections, in conjunction with gown, gloves, and eye protection…universal masking alone is not a panacea. A mask will not protect providers caring for a patient with active Covid-19 if it&rsquo;s not accompanied by meticulous hand hygiene, eye protection, gloves, and a gown. A mask alone will not prevent health care workers with early Covid-19 from contaminating their hands and spreading the virus to patients and colleagues.

This generates an impulse to touch the eyes. 3) If your hands are contaminated, you are infecting yourself, 4) Face masks make breathing more difficult. Moreover, a fraction of carbon dioxide previously exhaled is inhaled at each respiratory cycle. Those phenomena increase breathing frequency and deepness, and they may worsen the burden of covid-19 if infected people wearing masks spread more contaminated air. This may also worsen the clinical condition of infected people if the enhanced breathing pushes the viral load down into their lungs, 5) The innate immunity&rsquo;s efficacy is highly dependent on the viral load. If masks determine a humid habitat where SARS-CoV-2 can remain active because of the water vapour continuously provided by breathing and captured by the mask fabric, they determine an increase in viral load (by re-inhaling exhaled viruses) and therefore they can cause a defeat of the innate immunity and an increase in infections.&rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td><br><strong>34) <a href="https://rc.rcjournal.com/content/65/5/658?ijkey=be3bebb8efce2d5522cba138974e0cd41951803f&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">Risks of N95 Face Mask Use in Subjects With COPD</a></strong> , Kyung, 2020</td><td><br>&ldquo;Of the 97 subjects, 7 with COPD did not wear the N95 for the entire test duration.
