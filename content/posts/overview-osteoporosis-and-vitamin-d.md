^ **WHY Vitamin D can PREVENT both Osteopenia and osteoporosis** 

 **but not TREAT Osteoporosis**  

Vitamin D, in combination with it’s co-factors of Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin K2, etc. is able to increase Bone Mass Density, that is, increase the amount of bone in the body. A bone is made up of a large number of tiny bridges. One a bridge is broken, adding bone bone does not repair the bridge, it just thickens the bridge supports.

This was found decades ago – medicines which increased Bone Mass Density (BMD) did not TREAT Osteoporosis. Suspect, but do no know, that this is true as well for vitamin D^

#### Hypothesis: Moderate osteoporosis itself is beneficial for bones - Oct 2019

Med Hypotheses. 2019 Oct 10;134:109427. [doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109427](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109427)

Xiong Z1, Wu J1, Liu Z1, Jing W2.

There have been increasing numbers of reports that anti-osteoporosis drugs cause osteonecrosis. A typical example is medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) which can cause massive necrosis and defects of the jaws. Thus, the dosage and effects of anti-osteoporosis drugs should be re-examined. Our hypothesis is that primary** moderate osteoporosis itself is beneficial for bones and should not be excessively treated other than vitamin D, calcium supplementation and functional exercises **. The self-repair and anti-infection abilities of bone depend on its organic tissues including stem cells, blood vessels, osteoclastic and osteogenic factors in bone, which jointly fight against invading pathogens and repair bone damage. Recent evidence supports age-related changes in mesenchymal stem cell including** loss of self-renewal **and increases in senescent cell numbers. Thus, the number of MSCs and vessels need to be increased to achieve functions similar to those in young people. This requires dissolving a portion of inorganic materials and providing extra space to hold more cells and blood vessels. In contrast,** anti-osteoporosis drugs prevent bone destruction, and increase mineralization that occupies the space of organic materials, reduces bone immunity and self-repair **. Moreover, long term use of anti-osteoporosis drugs also have negative effects on long bones and cartilages. Therefore, moderate age-related osteoporosis is natural in humans to protect bones. Excessive treatment of osteoporosis weakens immunity and self-repair.

400 mcg of Vitamin K daily in the form of menaquininone, MK4 or MK7,

2000 mg of calcium carbonate, (update: this is too much if you also take > 2000 IU of vitamin D)

1,000 mg of phosphorus,

800 msg of magnesium citrate,

350 mg of strontium citrate,

20 mg of zinc picolinate,

200 mg of silicon (Horsetail extract),
