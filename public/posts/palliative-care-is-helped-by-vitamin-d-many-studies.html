The overall goal is to improve quality of life, and it is thus important that side effects of medical treatment do not outweigh beneficial effects. Vitamin D has few and mild side effects, and vitamin D treatment has well defined uses in medicine. However, the role of vitamin D supplementation to patients with advanced or metastatic cancer has rarely been studied. The papers included in this thesis aim at understanding the possible effects and optimal use of vitamin D in symptom management in palliative cancer patients, and to study effects of antibiotics in end-of-life cancer patients.</p><p>In study I, we investigated the effect of antibiotic use in patients in the last week of life. Almost 50 % in the studied cohort were treated with antibiotics during the last week in life; 37% of all patients and 50% of patients with septic symptoms experienced symptom relief.</p><p>Based on a study showing association between lower vitamin D levels and higher doses of opioids in patients with advanced cancer, we performed a pilot study to investigate effects of vitamin D in pain management, Quality of Life (QoL) and infections in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer, study II. Participants (n=39, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 75 nmol/L) received vitamin D 4000 IU/day for twelve weeks and were matched to untreated controls. After one month, the mean change in opioid dose was significantly lower in the vitamin D supplemented group -46 μg/h (95% CI -24-78), and difference increased over time. Differences in antibiotic use and QoL were also significant, in favor of the supplementation group.</p><p>The encouraging results from study II were used to plan study III, a multicentre, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation <strong>(4000 IU/day)</strong> on pain, infections, fatigue and QoL for 12 weeks. Last patient out was in June 2020, and results (submitted but not yet accepted manuscript) indicate a significant effect on opioid use and fatigue, but not on infections and QoL.</p><p>In a post-hoc analysis of a previously studied cohort of immunodeficient patients, study IV, we compared the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation administered as oil drops versus powdered tablets in raising the individual’s vitamin D level. There was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.77). In a subgroup of patients without immunoglobulin replacement, vitamin D supplementation with oil drops (n = 34) but not with tablets (n = 60) resulted in significantly less antibiotic use (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.58</p><hr><h4 id=trial-eventually-got-most-20ng-a-2015-trial-below-found-much-better-results-when-40-ng>Trial eventually got most >20ng, a 2015 trial (below) found much better results when >40 ng</h4><p>Many cancers patients have very low levels of Vitamin D</p><p>Took 12 weeks of 4,000 IU daily to get most >20 ng</p><p><strong>They gave only 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily<br>Would have had much faster and better success by quickly restoring vitamin D levels<br>Example: start with 50,000 IU daily for a week followed by 50,000 weekly</strong></p><hr><h4 id=thesis-later-published-in-journal---2021>Thesis later published in Journal - 2021</h4><p><strong>‘Palliative-D’—Vitamin D Supplementation to Palliative Cancer Patients: A Double Blind, Randomized Placebo-Controlled Multicenter Trial</strong></p><p>Cancers (Basel). 2021 Aug; 13(15): 3707 <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13153707>doi: 10.3390/cancers13153707</a></p><p><strong>Maria Helde Frankling</strong> ,1,2 Caritha Klasson,1,2,3 Carina Sandberg,3 Marie Nordström,3 Anna Warnqvist,4 Jenny Bergqvist,5,6 Peter Bergman,7,8 and Linda Björkhem-Bergman1,2,3,*</p><p>Eduardo Bruera, Academic Editor</p><p>In this study, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on pain, infections, fatigue and quality of life in patients with advanced cancer with verified vitamin D deficiency was studied. To this end, a randomized controlled trial, ‘Palliative-D’, was conducted, comparing the effect of 4000 IU vitamin D3/day for 12 weeks to placebo in cancer patients admitted to palliative care. Pain was assessed as change in opioid dose and infections measured as days on antibiotics. Vitamin D-supplemented patients increased their opioid doses at a significantly slower rate than patients receiving placebo, i.e., 0.56 µg less fentanyl/h per week with vitamin D treatment. Vitamin D reduced self-assessed fatigue but did not affect antibiotic use or self-assessed Quality of life. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. In conclusion, correction of vitamin D deficiency may have positive effects on pain and fatigue in palliative cancer patients.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The aim of the ‘Palliative-D’ study was to test the hypothesis that correction of vitamin D deficiency reduces opioid use in cancer patients admitted to palliative care. A multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in three home-based palliative care facilities in Sweden was performed. Patients with advanced cancer and 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 50 nmol/L were randomized to vitamin D3 4000 IU/day or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the difference of long-acting opioid use (fentanyl ug/h) between the groups during 12 weeks, based on four time points. Secondary outcomes included changes in antibiotic use, fatigue and Quality of Life (QoL). A total of 244 patients were randomized, and 150 patients completed the 12 weeks. The major reason for drop-out was death due to cancer. The vitamin D-group had a significantly smaller increase of opioid doses compared to the placebo-group; beta coefficient −0.56 (p = 0.03), i.e., 0.56 µg less fentanyl/h per week with vitamin D treatment. Vitamin D-reduced fatigue assessed with ESAS was −1.1 points after 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.01). Antibiotic use or QoL did not differ significantly between the groups. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. In conclusion, correction of vitamin D deficiency may have positive effects on opioid use and fatigue in palliative cancer patients, but only in those with a survival time more than 12 weeks.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/palliative-d-2021-compresspdf.pdf>Download the 2022 PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=post-hock-analysis-of-the-palliative-d-trial---jan-2022>Post-Hock analysis of the ‘Palliative-D’ trial - Jan 2022</h4><p>Nutrients 2022, 14(3), 602; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14030602>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14030602</a></p><p>25-Hydroxyvitamin D in Cancer Patients Admitted to Palliative Care: A Post-Hoc Analysis of the Swedish Trial ‘Palliative-D’</p><p>by Maria Helde Frankling, Caritha Klasson, Linda Björkhem-Bergman</p><ul><li><p>Karolinska Institutet, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Blickagången 16, Neo Floor 7, SE-141 83 Huddinge, Sweden</p></li><li><p>Thoracic Oncology Center, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden</p></li><li><p>Stockholms Sjukhem, Palliative Medicine, Mariebergsgatan 22, SE-112 19 Stockholm, Sweden</p></li></ul><p>The purpose of this study is to explore 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in patients with cancer in the palliative phase in relation to season, sex, age, tumor type, colectomy, and survival. To this end, we performed a post-hoc analysis of ‘Palliative-D’, a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigating the effect of daily supplementation with 4000 IU of vitamin D for 12 weeks on pain in patients in palliative cancer care. In the screening cohort (n = 530), <strong>10% of patients had 25-OHD levels &lt; 25 nmol/L, 50% &lt; 50</strong> , and 84% &lt; 75 nmol/L. Baseline 25-OHD did not differ between seasons or tumor type and was not correlated with survival time. In vitamin D deficient patients supplemented with vitamin D (n = 67), 86% reached sufficient levels, i.e., >50 nmol/L, after 12 weeks. An increase in 25-OHD was larger in supplemented women than in men (53 vs. 37 nmol/L, p = 0.02) and was not affected by season. In the placebo-group (n = 83), decreased levels of 25-OHD levels were noted during the study period for patients recruited during the last quarter of the year. In conclusion, cancer patients in palliative phase have adequate increase in 25-OHD after vitamin D supplementation regardless of season, age, tumor type, or colectomy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/palliative-d-2022-compresspdf.pdf>Download the 2022 PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=palliative-and-hospice-compared>Palliative and Hospice compared</h4><ul><li><p>Hospice is comfort care without curative intent; the patient no longer has curative options or has chosen not to pursue treatment because the side effects outweigh the benefits.</p></li><li><p>Palliative care is comfort care with or without curative intent.</p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/antibiotics.html><span class=tag>antibiotics</span></a>
