Objective

The relationship between vitamin D levels and depressive symptoms has been explored, but the results are inconsistent. Epidemiological evidence concerning the relationship between dietary vitamin D intake and depressive symptoms in pregnancy is nonexistent. The current cross-sectional study examined this issue in Japan.

Methods

Study subjects were 1745 pregnant women. Depressive symptoms were defined as present when subjects had a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score of 16 or higher. Dietary intake during the preceding month was assessed using a self-administered diet history questionnaire. Adjustment was made for age; gestation; region of residence; number of children; family structure; history of depression; family history of depression; smoking; secondhand smoke exposure at home and at work; job type; household income; education; body mass index; intake of saturated fatty acids; and intake of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid.

Results

The prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy was 19.3%.  **Higher dietary vitamin D intake was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy** , independent of potential dietary and non-dietary confounding factors. Multivariate odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for depressive symptoms during pregnancy in the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of assessed intake of vitamin D were 1 (reference), 0.79 (0.55−1.11), 0.73 (0.49−1.07), and 0.52 (0.30−0.89), respectively (P for trend = 0.02).

Conclusion

The current cross-sectional study in Japan suggests that higher vitamin D intake may be associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy.
