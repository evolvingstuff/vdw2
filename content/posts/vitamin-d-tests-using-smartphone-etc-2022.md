**Some companies provide quantitative results by looking at a vitamin D test strip  
The cost of the test strip is about 1/2 the cost of a dried blood spot test  
The in-home or in-office method gives results in 15 minutes  
The dried blood spot test gives results in 3-5 days (mail-in and email back)**
