Three weeks ago I read Clint Obers book on the medical benefits of free electrons from the Earth via grounding. What grabbed my interest was the amount of people with auto immune diseases reporting a sustained reduction of symptoms from daily grounding. I bought a Clint Ober bed mat and brought it with me to Spain. After about 10 days I noticed my energy and sense of vitality had improved. I love to walk in the hills here but since a relapse 3 years ago my legs prefer not to walk for more than 2 hours. This year on the 2 hour walks my legs felt like normal and I decided to do a walk I thought I would never do again. It is a 5 hour walk with a 400 meter elevation which is intense. I set off at 9 am and enjoyed a peaceful wander in the hills. My legs and energy were perfect and I felt like I had a new body.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I was grounded (verified) by socket tester for** 9 hours a night and two hours a day **with bare feet on soil for 12 days before this walk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D RCT using 100,000 IU monthly for a variety of health problems – results of ViDA due in 2016</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-rct-using-100000-iu-monthly-for-a-variety-of-health-problems-results-of-vida-due-in-2016.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-rct-using-100000-iu-monthly-for-a-variety-of-health-problems-results-of-vida-due-in-2016.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="update">Update&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and vitamin D deficiency are extremely prevalent worldwide (Holick 2007; World Health Organization 2011). The potential link between vitamin D deficiency and CVD-related death in both healthy and diseased populations is a growing area of translational research. Historically, the traditional role of vitamin D in maintaining calcium homeostasis and mineral metabolism has been extensively studied (Lieben and Carmeliet 2013). Vitamin D, via its classical genomic transcriptional activity, is known to affect the physiological function of a number of target organs such as the heart, bone, and kidneys (Lieben et al. 2011). Furthermore, as highlighted in a paper published recently in Physiological Resports (Foong et al. 2014), there appears to be a link between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory symptoms in chronic lung disease. In addition, a number of nongenomic, rapid action roles of vitamin D are now known to affect tissue function, which fall outside the traditional role of regulating mineral metabolism (Gniadecki 1998; Brown et al. 1999; Norman et al. 2002; Haussler et al. 2011). While calcium and phosphate have long been regarded as the major players in the interactions observed between mineral metabolism dysfunction and CVD- related deaths, (Peacock 2010; Bolland et al. 2011; Brini et al. 2013), these newer nongenomic roles outside of the traditional target organs suggest that vitamin D itself may have intrinsic actions outside the realm of mineral metabolism (Gniadecki 1998; Brown et al. 1999; Norman et al. 2002; Haussler et al. 2011).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longer time to fall to sleep in winter unless eat salmon (vitamin D and Omega-3)</title><link>/posts/longer-time-to-fall-to-sleep-in-winter-unless-eat-salmon-vitamin-d-and-omega-3.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/longer-time-to-fall-to-sleep-in-winter-unless-eat-salmon-vitamin-d-and-omega-3.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="fish-consumption-sleep-daily-functioning-and-heart-rate-variability">Fish consumption, sleep, daily functioning, and heart rate variability.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>STUDY OBJECTIVES:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This study investigated the effects of fatty fish on sleep, daily functioning and biomarkers such as heart rate variability (HRV), vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in red blood cells. Moreover the relationship among sleep, daily functioning, HRV, vitamin D status, and levels of EPA+DHA was investigated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Salmon intervention (vitamin D and Omega-3) improved heart rate variability and reduced anxiety</title><link>/posts/salmon-intervention-vitamin-d-and-omega-3-improved-heart-rate-variability-and-reduced-anxiety.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/salmon-intervention-vitamin-d-and-omega-3-improved-heart-rate-variability-and-reduced-anxiety.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">
