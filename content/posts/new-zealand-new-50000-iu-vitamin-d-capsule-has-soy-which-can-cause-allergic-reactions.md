#### [NZ Pharmacy – login required](http://www.pharmacytoday.co.nz/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=/news/2016/march-2016/07/warning-to-allergy-sufferers-about-newly-funded-vitamin-d-drug.aspx&returnid=39258)

NZ changed the single vitamin D supplier in Feb 2016

NW apparently provides all prescribed drugs at a deep discount

Many children with peanut allergies are also allergic products containing soy

I am unaware of any other Vitamin D product which still uses soy.

#### On the positive side

50,000 IU capsule – a good size

They recommend 1 per day for 10 days if deficient = 500,000 IU – standard

NZ subsidizes the vitamin D capsule

#### On the negative side

Prescription probably required

Possibility of allergic reaction

No mention of forms of vitamin D for those with gut problems

No mention of smaller dose sizes for non-adults

No mention of more vitamin D needed for those who are obese, etc.

#### Suggestion: if you live New Zealand

Buy an over-the-counter Vitamin D capsule which does not require a prescription and which does not have soy (or any other additive which causes adverse reactions).  Example  Bio-Tech– Amazon, etc.
