# Confirmed 2011

[Australia Doctor, April 2011](http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/37/0c070437.asp)

For those with no or minimal exposure to sunlight, Australian recommendations set an 

adequate intake (AI) of 5µg a day for adults aged 19-50,   **(200 IU)** 

rising to 10µg a day for 51-70-year-olds and  **(400 IU)** 

15µg a day for those over 70.  **(600 IU)** 

An upper level (UL) has been set at 80µg a day.  **(3200 IU)** 

The higher levels for older people are because the efficiency of production via the skin declines with age.

The AI for adults (19-50 years) for Australia was based on the amount of vitamin D required to maintain serum vitamin D at a level of at least 27.5nmol/L with minimal exposure to sunlight. Exposure to sunlight would be expected to increase levels.
