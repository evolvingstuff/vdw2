#### Vitamin D and eye: Current evidence and practice guidelines

 Indian J Ophthalmol. 2023 Apr;71(4):1127-1134. [doi: 10.4103/IJO.IJO](https://doi.org/10.4103/IJO.IJO)_3174_22.

Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that has widespread role in human physiology, not only in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis but also in immunomodulation, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are well known and are applicable to the ocular surface immune cells and structural cells. 

The role of vitamin D in ocular surface conditions such as 

* dry eye disease (DED), 

* keratoconus (KC), and 

* post-surgical outcomes 

has received widespread and well-deserved attention. Vitamin D supplementation is shown to improve DED clinically as well as in experimental models. The anti-inflammatory properties may be crucial in the treatment of ocular surface conditions such as DED and KC. Vitamin D plays a multifaceted role in corneal wound healing with its anti-inflammatory and extracellular matrix remodeling properties. In this review, we discuss how to approach patients with DED and those undergoing refractive surgery with the available basic and clinical knowledge on the role of vitamin D in these conditions. We aim to highlight the importance of clinically harnessing vitamin D-mediated natural immuno-inflammatory modulation in combination with currently available standard of care strategies to reduce the morbidity and disease duration associated with ocular surface diseases.

##### Comments on the study by VitaminDWiki

Study recommends 50,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks if less than 30 ng (75 nmol) initially

Study fails to recommend alternatives for those who are obese, have poor vitamin D genes, poor gut, etc

Study fails to recommend on-going maintenance dosing 

Study assumes that 30 ng level is all that is needed for eye problems <span>[tiki-index.php?page_id=9939]</span>

Study fails to mention Vitamin D prevention of various eye problems

Study fails to mention non-oral vitamin D

Study fails to mention loading dose to more-quickly treat the problem

Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that has widespread role in human physiology, not only in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis but also in immunomodulation, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. The immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are well known and are applicable to the ocular surface immune cells and structural cells. 
The role of vitamin D in ocular surface conditions such as 
*dry eye disease (DED), 
*keratoconus (KC), and 
*post-surgical outcomes 
has received widespread and well-deserved attention. Vitamin D supplementation is shown to improve DED clinically as well as in experimental models. The anti-inflammatory properties may be crucial in the treatment of ocular surface conditions such as DED and KC. Vitamin D plays a multifaceted role in corneal wound healing with its anti-inflammatory and extracellular matrix remodeling properties. In this review, we discuss how to approach patients with DED and those undergoing refractive surgery with the available basic and clinical knowledge on the role of vitamin D in these conditions.
