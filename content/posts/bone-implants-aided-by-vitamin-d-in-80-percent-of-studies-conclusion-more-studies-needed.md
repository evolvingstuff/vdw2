#### Efficacy of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Osseointegration of Implants.

Implant Dent. 2016 Feb 15.

PURPOSE:

The aim was to systematically review the efficacy of vitamin D3 (VD3) supplementation on the osseointegration of implants.

METHODS:

The addressed focused question was "does VD3 supplementation affect osseointegration around implants?" Indexed databases were searched from 1969 up to and including March 2015 using various key words including: "Bone to implant contact"; "implant"; "vitamin D"; and "osseointegration." Letters to the editor, case reports/case series, reviews, and articles published in languages other than English were excluded. The pattern of the present systematic review was customized to primarily summarize the pertinent data.

RESULTS:

Six experimental studies (4 in rodents and 2 in rabbits) were included. Number of titanium implants placed ranged between 28 and 100 implants.  **Results from 5 studies showed that VD3 supplementation enhanced new bone formation and/or bone to implant contact (BIC) around implants** . One study showed no significant difference in BIC and new bone formation around VD3 coated and noncoated implants. One study reported that insulin therapy with adjunct VD3 supplementation enhances new bone formation around implants in diabetic rats than when insulin replacement therapy is used alone.

CONCLUSION:

Efficacy of VD3 supplementation on osseointegration of implants remains controversial and requires further investigations.
