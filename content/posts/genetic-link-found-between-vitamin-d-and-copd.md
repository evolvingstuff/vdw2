Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation and it is thought that neutrophils play a major role in the disease pathogenesis. Genetic polymorphism of the vitamin-D-binding protein (VDBP) gene is considered one of the candidates for variation in susceptibility to COPD. To evaluate the potential influences of VDBP gene polymorphisms on COPD, a case-control study was conducted in the Han population of north-east China. The VDBP polymorphic site was genotyped in 100 COPD patients and 100 controls. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. A significantly higher proportion of VDBP-1F homozygosity was found in COPD patients, while the frequency of VDBP-2 homozygosity was significantly lower in COPD patients, which seemed to suggest that VDBP-2 homozygocity provided a protective effect. These data suggest that the VDBP gene may be involved in COPD susceptibility in Chinese Han population.
