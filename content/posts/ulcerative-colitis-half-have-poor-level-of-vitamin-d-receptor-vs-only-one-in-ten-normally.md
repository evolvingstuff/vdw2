Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory condition of the colon and rectal mucosa marked by recurrent periods of remission and exacerbation. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid receptor family that mediates the effects of vitamin D by regulating transcription of multiple cellular genes. We aimed to evaluate vitamin d receptor level in biopsy specimen of patients with UC in this study.

Methods

VDR levels were retrospectively studied in colon biopsy specimens of UC patients. The Spearman's rho correlation analysis, The Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov, Mann Whitney U, and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. The p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Study included 112 UC patients (65 male and 47 female) and 30 controls (19 female and 11 male) who had normal results in biopsy examinations carried out due to various reasons. VDR levels of UC patients were statistically lower than control subjects, and was not associated with duration of the disease and place of involvement.

Conclusions

VDR is an important receptor in the pathogenesis of UC, and optimizing vitamin D levels could have a therapeutic role in UC.
