#### Attenuation of morphine conditioned place preference and reinstatement by vitamin D

Behav Pharmacol. 2023 Aug 15. [doi: 10.1097/FBP.0000000000000747](https://doi.org/10.1097/FBP.0000000000000747)

 **Opioid**  action in the brain involves the dopamine-reward system as well as non-dopamine pathways. Since vitamin D also modulates the brain's dopamine system, the question of this study was how vitamin D might affect the  **opioid**  influences on the reward system. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the possible effect of vitamin D on the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by  **morphine** , as a valuable model of assessment of the reinforcing properties of  **opioids**  by associating the context to the rewarding properties of the addictive drugs. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two main groups that either received saline ( **morphine**  vehicle) or  **morphine**  (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for CPP. Each of the main groups was divided into three vitamin D treatment subgroups: vitamin D vehicle and vitamin D (5 and 10 μg/kg, intraperitoneally). Vitamin D injections were started 1 week ahead of the experiment (two injections) or immediately after post-conditioning and in both cases, it was continued twice weekly throughout the CPP. Administration of vitamin D (10 μg/kg) before conditioning in CPP markedly attenuated  **morphine**  expression in the post-conditioning test. Receiving vitamin D (5 or 10 μg/kg) before or after conditioning significantly attenuated  **morphine**  reinstatement. Administration of vitamin D after  **opioid**  conditioning facilitated  **morphine**  memory extinction and attenuated  **morphine**  reinstatement. Vitamin D is probably a valuable addition to be considered as a part of the treatment for prevention or minimizing the dependency or relapse to  **opioids** .

#### Wikipedia description of [Conditioned place preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditioned_place_preference)

"Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a form of Pavlovian conditioning used to measure the motivational effects of objects or experiences. This motivation comes from the pleasurable aspect of the experience, so that the brain can be reminded of the context that surrounded the "encounter". By measuring the amount of time an animal spends in an area that has been associated with a stimulus, researchers can infer the animal's liking for the stimulus."
