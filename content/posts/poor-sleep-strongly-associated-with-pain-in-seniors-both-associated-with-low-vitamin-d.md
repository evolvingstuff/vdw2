 **Observations by Henry Lahore of VitaminDWiki** 

1. Many people believe Pain ==> Poor sleep

1. The 2014 study documents Poor sleep <==> Pain  (association)

1. The  Mercola article has the premis of Poor Sleep ==> Pain

1. I have found that Magnesium, Vitamin D both help with sleep

1. I just recently discovered the 4-7-8 sequencing of breathing which puts me to sleep in just a few minutes

> Google breathing sleep 4 7 8 for details
