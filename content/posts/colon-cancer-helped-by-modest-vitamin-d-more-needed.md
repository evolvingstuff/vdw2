   * High level of MEG3 (a gene) helps a lot

 **SUNSHINE Randomized Clinical Trial**  compared the effect of high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D3 supplementation on progression-free survival (PFS) among patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer

* Lots of Chemotherapy

* Started with 8,000 IU daily for 2 weeks then maintenance of 4,000 IU daily

* 35 ng average at trial end

* greater effect on survival if lower body mass index, more metastases, and KRAS wild-type tumors.

   *  **Needed more to get most people about 35 ng level, not just half** 

   * Also anticipate better survival if use larger loading dose ASAP

   * A typical loading dose protocol gives 400,000 IU in one week.  This study used 112,000 IU in 2 weeks

 **AMATERASU Randomized Clinical Trial**  investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on relapse-free survival (RFS) among patients with digestive tract cancers.

* stage I-III digestive tract epithelial carcinoma after surgical resection from the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, or rectum.

* 2,000 IU daily did not help, not a news item
