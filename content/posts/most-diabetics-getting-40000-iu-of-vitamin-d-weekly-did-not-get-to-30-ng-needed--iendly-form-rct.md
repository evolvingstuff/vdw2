We assessed the effect of different doses of vitamin D supplementation on microcirculation, signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Sixty-seven patients with T2DM and peripheral neuropathy (34 females) were randomized into two treatment groups: 

Cholecalciferol 5000 IU and 40,000 IU once/week orally for 24 weeks. Severity of neuropathy (NSS, NDS scores, visual analogue scale), cutaneous microcirculation (MC) parameters and inflammatory markers (ILs, CRP, TNFÎ±) were assessed before and after treatment. 

 **Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was detected in 78% of the 62 completed subjects.**  Following treatment with cholecalciferol 40,000 IU/week, a significant decrease in neuropathy severity (NSS, p = 0.001; NDS, p = 0.001; VAS, p = 0.001) and improvement of cutaneous MC were observed (p < 0.05). Also, we found a decrease in IL-6 level (2.5 pg/mL vs. 0.6 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and an increase in IL-10 level (2.5 pg/mL vs. 4.5 pg/mL, p < 0.001) after 24 weeks of vitamin D supplementation in this group. No changes were detected in the cholecalciferol 5000 IU/week group. High-dose cholecalciferol supplementation of 40,000 IU/week for 24 weeks was associated with improvement in clinical manifestation, cutaneous microcirculation and inflammatory markers in patients with T2DM and peripheral neuropathy.
