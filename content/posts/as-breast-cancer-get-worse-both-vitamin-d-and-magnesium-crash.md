Background: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed subtypes of breast cancer, representing the majority of breast cancer cases. This study investigates the levels of vitamin D, folic acid, and antioxidant minerals (zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)) in IDC patients across different disease stages to explore their potential roles in disease progression.

Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 150 female patients with IDC, aged between 30 and 67 years (51 ± 15.5 years). Blood samples were collected to measure levels of vitamin D, folic acid, Cu, Mg, and Zn. Patients were categorized into Stage 1 to Stage 4 of cancer. Variations in nutrient levels across these stages were statistically assessed using ANOVA and post-hoc tests.

Results: The study results revealed varying levels of key nutrients across different stages of the disease. Vitamin D levels averaged 17.7 ng/mL, with higher concentrations in early-stage patients, indicating a possible correlation with disease severity. Folic acid levels had a mean of 12.2 ng/mL, showing a decline in later stages, potentially linking it to cancer progression. Copper levels averaged 161.3μg/dL, peaking at 170μg/dL in Stage 3, suggesting a connection with cancer aggressiveness. Magnesium levels, with an average of 1.4 mg/dL, dropped notably to 0.6 mg/dL by Stage 4, highlighting its possible involvement in disease progression. Zinc levels averaged 69.4 μg/dL, with a significant decrease in advanced stages, emphasizing its importance for immune function and cellular health.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant variations in the levels of vitamin D, folic acid, and antioxidant minerals across different stages of IDC. These nutrients may influence cancer progression, underscoring the potential benefits of nutritional assessments and interventions in managing IDC.
