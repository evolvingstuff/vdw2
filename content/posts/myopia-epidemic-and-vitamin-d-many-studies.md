* Myopia and many other vision problems are associated with low Vitamin D.

* More Myopia if less sun exposure (combination of more Vitamin D and focusing at a distance).

* More [Myopia if obese](http://ophthalmologica.perdami.or.id/index.php/journal/article/view/101513) (obese have lower levels of Vitamin D).

* One study found all children with Myopia had < 50ng/mL of Vitamin D.

* Suspect that Vitamin D will be proven to prevent Myopia.

* Suspect that Vitamin D plus eye exercise will be proven to treat Myopia.

#### Video screens, Lack of Sun Are Causing an Epidemic of Myopia - WSJ Aug 2023

 **[Wall St. Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/our-eyes-really-are-getting-worse-heres-how-to-save-your-kids-vision-de16d592?mod=hp_lead_pos5)** 

Screens include Video, TV, Computer, Gaming

* “There’s something in the spectrum of visible light that prevents the eyeball from growing too much,”

* Children spend [more than seven hours a day](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2785686) looking at screens, on average, and some studies find teens are [online almost constantly](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/).

* The International Myopia Institute recommends children spend [80 to 120 minutes](https://myopiainstitute.org/imi-whitepaper/imi-prevention-of-myopia-and-its-progression/) in daylight every day. This doesn’t have to be all at once, say doctors—15 minutes here and there adds up.

#### Myopia exploding: 3X increase in half a century in Asia - Sept 2022

 **[THE MYOPIA GENERATION - Why do so many kids need glasses now?](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/10/kids-glasses-vision-increased-nearsightedness-myopia/671244/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=atlantic-daily-newsletter&utm_content=20230731&utm_term=The Atlantic Daily)** 

* " In East and Southeast Asia, where this shift is most dramatic, the proportion of teenagers and young adults with myopia has jumped from roughly a quarter to more than 80 percent in just over half a century"

* In the U.S., 42 percent of 12-to-54-year-olds were nearsighted in the early 2000s—the last time a national survey of myopia was conducted—_up from a quarter in the 1970s.

  * About a 1.7 X increase

* Discusses 7 possible reasons and several expensive methods that stop the trend - 1 child at a time
