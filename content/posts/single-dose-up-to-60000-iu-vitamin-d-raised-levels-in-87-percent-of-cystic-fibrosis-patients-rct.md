#### Single high-dose oral vitamin D3 (stoss) therapy--a solution to vitamin D deficiency in children with cystic fibrosis?

J Cyst Fibros. 2013 Mar;12(2):177-82. [doi: 10.1016/j.jcf.2012.08.007.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2012.08.007.) Epub 2012 Sep 19.

OBJECTIVES:

To determine the safety and efficacy of stoss therapy on vitamin D levels over a 12 month period in children with cystic fibrosis and vitamin D deficiency (<75 nmol/L).

STUDY DESIGN:

Retrospective chart review of 142 paediatric CF patients from 2007 till 2011.

RESULTS:

Thirty eight children received stoss therapy and 37 children with vitamin D deficiency were not treated and served as a control group. The stoss treated group had a significant and sustained increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels measured at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment compared to controls (94.82 ± 41.0 nmol/L, p=0.001; 81.54 ± 24.6 nmol/L, p=0.001; 92.18 ± 36.5 nmol/L, p=0.008 and 64.6 ± 20.0 nmol/L, p=0.006 respectively). At 12 months post intervention, the mean difference in vitamin D levels from baseline between the stoss treated group and controls was significant at 15 nmol/L compared to 5 nmol/L (p=0.038).

CONCLUSION:

Stoss therapy effectively achieves and maintains levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 75 nmol/L over 12 months.
