BACKGROUND:

The role of vitamin D in Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is ambiguous and clinical trials are needed to assess the role of vitamin D in the treatment of AD. The aim of this clinical trial study to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on patients with AD.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:

sixty AD patients were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study. They were randomly divided into two groups and treated for 60 days: group vitamin D (n=30), and placebo group (n=30). The two groups were as follows: Group D, 1600 IU cholecalciferol (vitamin D) and second group placebo. The severity of AD was evaluated based on SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) and TIS (Three Item Severity score) value by the same trained physician before and after the trial.

RESULTS:

According to SCORAD and TIS value index in the vitamin D group showed significant improvement in patients with mild, moderate and severe AD (P<0.05) and in patients who the intake placebo, this improvement didn't showed (P>0.05).

CONCLUSION:

Results mention that supplementation with oral vitamin D dramatically improved disease severity in AD patients.

PMID: 22395583
