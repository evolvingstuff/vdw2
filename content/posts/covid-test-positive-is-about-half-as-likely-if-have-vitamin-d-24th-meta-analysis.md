Introduction: Vitamin D levels have been reported to be associated with COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and mortality events. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the use of vitamin D intervention on COVID-19 outcomes.

Areas covered: Literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. We included RCTs reporting the use of vitamin D intervention to control/placebo group in COVID-19. The study was registered at PROSPERO: CRD42021271461.

Expert opinion: A total of 6 RCTs with 551 COVID-19 patients were included. The overall collective evidence pooling all the outcomes across all RCTs indicated the beneficial use of vitamin D intervention in COVID-19 (relative risk, RR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.92, Z=2.33, p=0.02, I2 = 48%). 

The rates of RT-CR positivity was significantly decreased in the intervention group as compared to the non-vitamin D groups (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.89, Z=2.31, p=0.02, I2 = 0%). Conclusively, COVID-19 patients supplemented with vitamin D are more likely to demonstrate fewer rates of ICU admission, mortality events and RT-PCR positivity.
