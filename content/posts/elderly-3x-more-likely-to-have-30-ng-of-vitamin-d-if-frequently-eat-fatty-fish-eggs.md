BACKGROUND:

Diet is a major exogenous source of vitamin D. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether the yes/no answer to a simple question exploring diet 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">("Do you eat fatty fish at least once a week and/or eggs several times per week?")</span>**  

could be associated with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D status among 261 older in- and outpatients (mean ± standard deviation, 83.5 ± 8.1 years).

METHODS:

Two groups were distinguished based on the binary yes/no answer. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤ 75 nmol/L.

RESULTS:

More participants with hypovitaminosis D answered "No" to the question on diet compared to their counterparts (p = 0.002). Answering "No" was associated with hypovitaminosis D (OR = 3.22, p = 0.001) after adjustment for potential confounders, with a positive predictive value = 79 %.

CONCLUSION:

A simple dietary question may identify older patients with hypovitaminosis D who should receive vitamin D supplements.
