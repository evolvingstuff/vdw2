Background/aim: Vitamin D3 (VD3) affects the regulation of the immune system, including the differentiation and function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Tregs play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The effects of VD3 on Treg-associated immune function were investigated in Thai patients in the early stages of CRC.

Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients were randomized to one of two groups: Untreated or treatment with VD3 for 3 months. Whole blood samples were collected at baseline, and at 1 and 3 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and the populations of forkhead box P3-positive Treg cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of Treg-associated cytokines, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

Results: Serum VD3 levels of the VD3-treated group were significantly increased at 1 (p=0.017) and 3 months (p<0.001) compared to the untreated control group. The mean percentage of Tregs was maintained between 1 and 3 months in the VD3-treated group. At 3 months, the untreated group had significantly lower Treg levels than the VD3-treated group (p=0.043). Serum IL-10 levels of the VD3-treated group were statistically increased at 1 month compared to the control group (p=0.032). No significant difference in serum TGF-β1 levels was observed between the two groups. However, the TGF-β1 level in the VD3-treated group at 1 month was lower than that of the control.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that VD3 supplementation can maintain immune responses in the early stages of CRC, helping to control Treg function. Therefore, VD3 should be supplemented to maintain immune homeostasis, especially in patients with vitamin D deficiency.
