 **Comments by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki** 

* This study shows that the people who got 10 micrograms of Vitamin D or Vitamin B12 had a 25% reduction in risk of getting Pancratic Cancer. The taking of the vitamins might have resulted in the decreased risk, but perhaps taking the vitamins was associated with some other health promotion behaviour which resulted in less pancratic cancer.

* Suspect that taking both vitamins will result in even less pancratic cancer

* Suspect that taking more of each vitamin would futher reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer
