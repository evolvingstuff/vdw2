[Publisher want $49 for the PDF](https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Abstract/publishahead/Increasing_Vitamin_D_Serum_Levels_Is_Associated.96707.aspx%20)

Must have been a small dose as vitamin D levels were raised from 21 ng to only 25 ng

25 ng is not enough to show a benefit for most health problems

CFF.ORG stated that at least 30 ng is needed for CF (see below)
