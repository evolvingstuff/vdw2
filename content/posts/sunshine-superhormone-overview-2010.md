# Vitamin D, The Sunshine Superhormone

 **Dr Peter J Lewis, Australia - Updated 15.04.10**     

 **The following is extracted from the PDF at the bottom of this page**               

#### Vitamin D is not a true vitamin, as it is not an essential dietary factor - it is actually a hormone precursor that is normally produced in the skin through the action of sunlight (UVB) on 7- dehydrocholesterol.

#### Vitamin D3, made in the skin, is transported to the liver where it is metabolised to 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D; aka calcidiol]</span>, the major circulating form. Further metabolism occurs in the kidney (and throughout the body) to form the highly biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D; aka calcitriol]</span>.

#### Vitamin D is stored in fat, and excess oral vitamin D is excreted in the bile.

#### It is largely through historical accident that vitamin D was classified in the early 1920s as a vitamin rather than a steroid hormone.   
The molecular structure of vitamin D is closely related to that of classic steroid hormones (e.g. oestradiol, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA and cortisol). 1,25(OH)2D is the most potent steroid hormone in the human body, active at 1/1,000,000,000,000 of a gram!

# Sources

 **Sunlight:** 

For people living in Australia, the main source of vitamin D is through exposure to sunlight.  Studies have shown that between 90-100% of the daily requirement for vitamin D comes simply from being in the sun for about 15-20 minutes a day.

 **Dietary sources:** 

Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, and it is exceptionally difficult to obtain adequate levels of vitamin D solely from the diet. Oily fish, such as salmon, sardines, mackerel and herring are the best sources. Other food sources include shitake mushrooms, egg yolk and fortified foods.

# Vitamin D deficiency

Vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem. 

A significant number of Australians are deficient in vitamin D - it is a fallacy that Australians receive adequate vitamin D from casual exposure to sunlight.

# Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency

Inadequate sun exposure

-        Time spent outdoors

-        Excessive ËœSlip, Slop, Slap"-ing (using sunscreen can reduce your body's vitamin D production by almost 100%)

-        Infants (especially if solely breast fed)

-        Elderly

-        Dark skin

-        Religious/cultural (covered-up style of dress)

-        Latitude

-        Seasonal variation

-        Global dimming (due to atmospheric pollution)

Washing after sun exposure

Ageing

Obesity

Pregnancy

Smoking

Malabsorption e.g. cystic fibrosis, coeliac disease, Crohn's disease

Liver disease (impaired conversion of vitamin D to 25-hydroxy vitamin D)

Kidney failure (impaired conversion of 25-hydroxy vitamin D to 1,25-dihdroxy vitamin D)

Calcium deficiency - results in increased 25-hydroxy vitamin D inactivation in the liver

Some drugs - statins, anticonvulsants, cholestyramine, colestipol, orlistat, ketoconazole

Vitamin A excess may antagonize the actions of vitamin D

Burn injury

Psychiatric disorders

Genetic variability accounts for 25-50% of the variation of vitamin D levels

# What are the consequences of lack of vitamin D?

 **Vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis D) is associated with numerous health problems, including:** 

Increased inflammation (elevated CRP)

Muscle weakness and pain - hypovitaminosis D myopathy (HDM)

Rotator cuff muscle degeneration

# What should my vitamin D level be?

A blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is the best indicator of vitamin D status.

25OHD level (nmol/L):

<100 = Deficient 

100-200 = Ideal 

135-225 = Normal in sunny countries

>250 = Excessive 

500+ = Potentially toxic 

# Treatment of vitamin D deficiency

## Adequate sun (UVB) exposure (20 minutes/day, without sunscreen)

## Diet: increase consumption of oily fish Vitamin D supplementation: Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the natural form of vitamin D in humans and animals.

To correct a deficiency, 4,000-15,000 IU of D3 a day for 3 months, may be required; thereafter, 2,000-10,000 IU/day will generally be sufficient as a maintenance dose (depending on sun exposure). Maintenance vitamin D supplementation may be taken as a single weekly dose.

# Toxicity

Vitamin D toxicity is also known as hypervitaminosis D. All known poisonings with vitamin D3 reflect misuse on an industrial scale. All reports of iatrogenic (doctor-caused) vitamin D intoxification of adults have involved large doses of vitamin D2 or calcitriol.

Safe level (25OHD) < 250 nmol/L

Potentially toxic level (25OHD) 500+ nmol/L [requires a sustained daily intake >/= 40,000 IU](requires%20a%20sustained%20daily%20intake%20>/=%2040,000%20IU)
