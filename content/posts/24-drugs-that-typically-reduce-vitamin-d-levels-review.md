| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  **Medication**  |  **Type**  |  **Effect on Vitamin D**  |
| Metformin | Antidiabetic | May lower vitamin D levels, with other oral antidiabetic medications |
| Thiazolidinediones (TDZs) | Antidiabetic | Increases risk of bone loss, especially in women |
| Thiazide Diuretics | Diuretic | Potential increased risk of hypercalcemia |
| Loop Diuretics | Diuretic | Potential increased risk of hyperparathyroidism and increased conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D |
| Potassium-Sparing Diuretics | Diuretic | Mixed findings |
| Calcium Channel Blockers | Cardiovascular | Increase risk of vitamin D deficiency |
| Angiotensin-ConvertingEnzyme (ACE) Inhibitors | Cardiovascular | May lower vitamin D levels |
| Statins | Cardiovascular | Mixed findings; some have shown increased vitamin D levels while others have found decreased levels with statin use |
| Bile Acid Sequestrants | Cardiovascular | May decrease vitamin D absorption, increase risk of osteomalacia at certain doses |
| Vitamin K Antagonists | Cardiovascular | May lower vitamin D levels |
| Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors | Cardiovascular | Mixed findings |
| Heparin | Cardiovascular | Negatively affects vitamin D metabolism, increases risk of osteoporotic fractures, especially seen with unfractionated heparin |
| Digoxin | Cardiovascular | Linked to lower vitamin D |
| Benzodiazepines | CNS | Linked to lower vitamin D |
| Antidepressants (SSRIs) | CNS | Linked to lower vitamin D |
| Enzyme-Inducing Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) | CNS | Linked to lower vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency |
| Newer Antiepileptic Drugs | CNS | Mixed findings; may lower bone mineral density and increase risk of fracture |
| Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) | Gastrointestinal | May increased risk of osteoporosis; vitamin D and calcium supplementation recommended |
| Histamine H2-Receptor Antagonists | Gastrointestinal | May decrease vitamin D, mixed findings |
| Lipase Inhibitors | Gastrointestinal | May inhibit vitamin D uptake and absorption |
| Laxatives | Gastrointestinal | Reduce vitamin D absorption, may result in osteomalacia |
| Corticosteroids | Anti-Inflammatory | May reduce vitamin D levels, increase risk of osteoporosis |
| Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) | Anti-Inflammatory | Mixed findings; long term use may negatively impact bone metabolism and bone mineral density, especially in those with COPD |
| Hydroxychloroquine | Anti-Inflammatory | May increase vitamin D levels |
| Antimicrobials | Anti-infectives/<br>Antivirals | May decrease vitamin D; increased risk of osteomalacia with prolonged use |
| Sulphonamides and Urea Derivatives | Anti-infectives/<br>Antivirals | Lower vitamin D levels |
| Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) | Anti-infectives/<br>Antivirals | Mixed findings, may lower vitamin D |
| Chemotherapeutic Agents | Cancer | May lower vitamin D levels; studies show vitamin D may enhance the effect of these therapies |
