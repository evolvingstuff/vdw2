A brief survey of recent literature was conducted with regard to vitamin D and pain. There is evidence for and against a role for vitamin D in the treatment of chronic pain. The contradictory findings may have to do with study design or perhaps the type and intensity of pain. To answer the question whether there is a role for vitamin D in the treatment of chronic pain, larger and longer duration studies need to be conducted. The design should also be such to assess whether vitamin D might act to increase the effectiveness of existing analgesics and/or reduce the dose and duration of their use, thereby increasing safety.
