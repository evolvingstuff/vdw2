Lungs can fully activate inhaled Vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp; Liver and kidneys not needed for activation

Vitamin D mists can be made by atomizers from diluted Vitamin D emulsions

Atomizers ($10-$20)  eject about 150 IU of Vitamin D per second

&nbsp; &nbsp; >5 million molecules of Vitamin D for each alveolus every second 

10 people tested as of May 2019 - all able to breathe better in 10 minutes 

&nbsp; &nbsp;   - initial testing with smoke, church incense, asthma, intense exercise, COPD ... 

Experimenting with 6 emulsions and 6 inhalers as of May 2019

Vitamin D levels (typically 100 ng with 12,000 IU daily) doubled to over 200 ng after 6 second daily inhalation for a month- very strange. The total inhaled vitamin D of 25,000 IU for the month had the effect of perhaps 25,000 IU daily,   **Thus inhaled creates about 30X more response than oral.**
