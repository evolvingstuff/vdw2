The relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels has emerged. Postmenopausal (PM) women are at increased risk of CAD and vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. To investigate the relationship between CAD and VitD levels in PM women.This case-control study included 93 consecutive female patients aged 50 to 79 years old undergoing coronary angiography for evaluation of CAD and 119 age-matched controls. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were classed as adequate (serum 25(OH)D: ≥20 ng/mL); insufficient (serum 25(OH)D: 10 to <20 ng/mL); and deficient (serum 25(OH)D: <10 ng/mL). 

Major cardiovascular risk factors were also explored.CAD occurred in 

* 67/127 (52.8%) patients with VitD deficiency; 

* 21/66 (31.8%) patients that were VitD insufficient; and in 

* 5/19 (26.3%) patients with adequate VitD levels. 

Multivariate regression analysis suggested that a deficiency of VitD increased CAD (odds ratio =  **2.891** ; 95% confidence interval = 1.459-7.139, P < .001).

VitD deficiency should be evaluated in PM women as a possible cause of CAD.
