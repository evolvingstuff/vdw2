Despite the high morbidity and mortality rate of osteoporosis, the proportion of patients who receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment remains very low. A specific osteoporosis program increased the percentage of patients receiving diagnosis and/or treatment for osteoporosis. We set up a program to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with low-trauma fractures or suspicion of osteoporosis. Two geriatricians were especially designated for this program. The program included patients admitted to the emergency room, inpatients and outpatients from the orthopedic department or the internal medicine/geriatric department. The assessment was performed over two visits and included an evaluation of risk factors for osteoporosis and falls, a physical examination, a collection of biological parameters, and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In the second visit the physician prescribed, if appropriate, anti-osteoporotic treatment. 

During a two-year period, 156 patients were included in the program; 85.4 % were women. 

Hip fracture was the most common fracture, followed by vertebral and arm (respectively 28.6%, 11.5%, and 7.6%). 

While half the patients had a personal history of low-trauma fractures,  **only 17% received osteoporosis treatment** . 

Anti-osteoporotic treatments were prescribed for 49% of the patients (p<0.001). 

It was mainly 

* vitamin D (35%), 

* calcium supplementation (31.2%), and 

* oral bisphosphonate (23.6%). 

Inclusion in our program increased the number of patients receiving anti-osteoporotic treatment from 17.2 to 49.7%. All fallers received falls - prevention counseling based on written materials and oral information. A specific program increases the percentage of patients receiving diagnosis and treatment for osteoporosis for patients with low-trauma fractures or suspicion of osteoporosis. Our next objectives are to develop this program to other health care's professionals.

## Probably would have PREVENTED many of the falls if they had enough vitamin D and co-factors
