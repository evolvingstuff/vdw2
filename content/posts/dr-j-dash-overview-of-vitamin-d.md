# Vitamin D Deficiency, the Ignored Epidemic of the Developed  World

by Jeffrey Dach MD::

<img src="http://images.quickblogcast.com/80618-70584/471px_Girl_in_the_Sunlight__Portrait_of_Maria_Simonovich__1888__Oil_on_canvas__The_Tretyakov_Gallery2C_Moscow2C_Russia_.jpg" alt="Vitamin" width="207" height="254">  **Is it a New Bio-Tech Drug, or is it  Vitamin D?** ~~::::

~~#330066:What if I told you I  discovered a Bio-Tech company with a new drug that could reduce the  number of cancer deaths in the US by 43,000 annually, reduce colon  cancer by 50%, and breast and ovarian cancer by 30%. Would you be  impressed?  What if I then told you this same drug could safely prevent  or alleviate the following medical conditions: Osteoporosis,  Hypertension, Cardiovascular disease, Cancer, Depression, Epilepsy, Type  One Diabetes, Insulin resistance, Autoimmune Diseases, Migraine  Headache, Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS), Musculoskeletal and bone  pain, Psoriasis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease  (Cohn’s), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)([15](http://clltopics.org/vitamin%20D3/vitamin%20D%20essential%20for%20health.htm)),  as well as improve calcium absorption and reduce hip fractures.([5A](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/PDFs/cme-clinical-importance-vit-d.pdf))

Would you then be even more impressed, and rush out to buy the company  stock and get rich quick?  Of course you would, but we don’t need a new  Bio-Tech drug to do this, because, all of the above benefits can be  obtained with Vitamin D, an inexpensive vitamin which is free with sun  exposure. 

 **Vitamin D Deficiency in Florida, Surely You must Be Joking:** 

We all know it’s a fact: Everyone in Florida gets plenty of Vitamin D  from the Florida Sun. This would have been true except for the fact that  as Floridians, we are all told to avoid the sun to prevent solar skin  damage (brown wrinkling) and to avoid skin cancer. 

So the question remains, do we get enough Vitamin D from sun exposure?  To answer this question, we actually measured blood Vitamin D levels,  and we were surprised to discover that the  **majority** showed  Vitamin D deficiency (less than 20 ng/ml), or insufficiency (less than  40 ng/ml). 

What if you are not fortunate to live in sunny Florida and you live up  north above the Mason Dixon Line, in Boston, New York, Chicago, Canada  or Scandinavia? Northern latitudes have an even more serious vitamin D  deficiency because of the lack of UV sunlight during the winter months.  The angle of the sun through the atmosphere closes off the UltraViolet  Light from reaching the earth. 

 **An Epidemic of Vitamin D Deficiency** 

Vitamin D deficiency has been reported in 57% of 290 medical inpatients  in Massachusetts, 93% of 150 patients with overt musculoskeletal pain in  Minnesota, 48% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis, 50% of patients  with lupus and fibromyalgia, 42% of healthy adolescents, 40% of African  American Women, and 62 % of the morbidly obese, 83% of 360 patients with  low back pain in Saudi Arabia, 73% of Austrian patients with Ankylosing  Spondylitis, 58% of Japanese girls with Graves's Disease, 40% of  Chinese adolescent girls, 40-70% of all Finnish medical patients. ([5A](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/PDFs/cme-clinical-importance-vit-d.pdf)) 

 **Vitamin D Toxicity** 

Vitamin D excess and toxicity requires daily dosage in excess of 40,000  units over a period of months, so 5,000 units a day is safe and far  below the level needed to develop vitamin D toxicity. Remember Vitamin D  is a fat soluble vitamin, so toxicity is possible with massive doses  over long periods of time. Vitamin D toxicity causes elevated calcium  levels. That’s why Vitamin D supplementation should done only under your  physician’s supervision with monitoring of serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D  levels. 

 **Space Satellite Maps** 

Maps of UV Sunlight exposure correlate with incidence of Cancer and  Multiple Sclerosis. 

If you take NASA space satellite photos of North America and color code  the UV sunlight exposure as Dr. Grant has done on his [web site, Sunarc.org](http://www.sunarc.org/) ([3](http://www.sunarc.org/)), you will see a pattern remarkably  similar to the incidence of cancer and multiple sclerosis. This is  thought to be due to differences in Vitamin D levels. The farther north  with less sun exposure and lower Vitamin D levels, there is an increased  incidence of cancer and multiple sclerosis. 

 **Diseases Caused By, or Associated With Vitamin D Deficiency:** 

Again here is the list: Osteoporosis, Hypertension, Cardiovascular  disease, Cancer, Depression, Epilepsy, Type One Diabetes, Insulin  resistance, Autoimmune Diseases, Migraine Headache, PolyCystic Ovary  Disease (PCOS), Musculoskeletal and bone pain, Psoriasis, and chronic  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)([15](http://clltopics.org/vitamin%20D3/vitamin%20D%20essential%20for%20health.htm)).  

The current recommendation for Vitamin D deficiency in those people who  must avoid the sun is 5,000 IU of Vitamin D per day which costs 5 cents a  day.. 

 **Vitamin D is not really a Vitamin, it is a Hormone.** 

<img src="http://images.quickblogcast.com/80618-70584/180px_Cholecalciferol_svg.png" alt="image" width="180" height="193"> Like all other steroidal hormones, vitamin D  is made from a cholesterol precursor, converted in the skin by sunlight.  Like all other hormones, Vitamin D enters the nucleus of the cell and  binds to the DNA where it gives a message to the DNA to manufacture  proteins.

 **Vitamin D And Multiple Sclerosis.** 

A review by Dr. Brown reported that Vitamin D supplementation prevented  the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalitis,  an animal model of MS, in mice. A large, prospective, cohort study  found that vitamin D supplementation was associated with a 40% reduction  in the risk of developing MS. Four small, noncontrolled studies  suggested that vitamin D supplementation may decrease exacerbation of MS  symptoms. ([20](http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/6/1158)) 

MRI studies of multiple sclerosis lesions show improvement during summer  months and worsening during winter months suggesting a Vitamin D link. ([36](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=10939587&amp;ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum))  

 **Vitamin D and Cancer** 

A four-year clinical [trial](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070428.wxvitamin28/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home),  involving 1,200 women found those taking the vitamin had about a  60-per-cent reduction in cancer incidence, compared with those who  didn't take it, a drop so large — twice the impact on cancer attributed  to smoking — it almost looks like a typographical error. The study was  done by professor of medicine Robert Heaney of Creighton University in  Nebraska and was published in June 2007. ([36A](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070428.wxvitamin28/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home))([36](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=10939587&amp;ordinalpos=5&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum))

 **Vitamin D and Total Mortality** 

A 2007 meta-analysis review of 18 studies showed a reduction in all  cause mortality of about 10% in people supplementing with commonly used  doses of Vitamin D.([39](http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/167/16/1730))

 **Vitamin D Supplementation for Adults** 

The RDA in America is only 400 IU per day, yet current research suggests  that our daily Vitamin D requirement is closer to 4,000 to 5,000 IU.  Twenty minutes of Sun exposure will give us ten to twenty thousand IU of  Vitamin D. 

Adult Supplementation with Carlson’s Cod Liver Oil can provide Vitamin D  along with Vitamin A . However, for an intake of 5,000 IU vitamin D per  day, inexpensive Vitamin D3 capsules are widely available for about 5  cents a day. We provide these as a convenience to our office patients. 

 **Vitamin D Testing at the Lab** 

Optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values are 45-50 ng/ml. Below 40 ng/ml  is called Vitamin D insufficiency, and below 20 ng/ml is deficiency. 

 **Conclusion** 

Our health care system is in crisis. We are spending billions on  expensive procedures like coronary artery bypass and organ  transplantation, yet measurements of health are lower than other  countries that spend less. In terms of getting more bang for your health  care buck, Vitamin D testing and supplementation for the population is  one solution which is guaranteed to improve overall health of the  population at a ridiculously low cost. 

The cost saving in reduced cancer rates, and lower osteoporotic fracture  rates would be enormous, and we would all enjoy improved health. My  goal as a physician in our community is to improve the health of of our  community, and Vitamin D testing and supplementation is one way to  achieve that goal with no adverse side effects and enormous cost  savings.
