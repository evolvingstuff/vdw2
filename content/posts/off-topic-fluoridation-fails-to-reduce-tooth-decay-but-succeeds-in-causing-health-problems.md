Includes video with transcript, references, comments, etc.

* 67 % of Americans receive fluoridated water

> More people drink fluoridated water in the US than in the rest of the world combined.

* >100 published studies have found fluoride's harm to the brain

* Fluoridated countries  **do not have**  less tooth decay than non-fluoridated countries.

* > 40 % of American teens show visible signs of fluoride overexposure (CDC)

> Outwardly visual signs of this condition include pitting and discoloration of your teeth, 

* African American and Mexican American children have significantly higher rates of dental fluorosis, (dark skin, vitamin D?)

 **Added the following** 

* 97 percent of the Western Europe drinks non-fluoridated water.

* >40 human studies and 100 animal studies linking fluoride to brain damage

* fluoride added to most water supplies is not the naturally occurring variety

* For Infants, Fluoridated Water Provides No Benefits, Only Risks

> Note - distilled water is available in many places for making infant formula

* Fluoride Supplements Have Never Been Approved by the FDA

### Note: Fluoride removes Magnesium  from the body by making Magnesium Fluoride

* Totally unknown: How much Magnesium is removed by Fluoridated water: 0.1%, 1%. 10% ?

* Unable to quickly find Magnesium deficiency in Europe to compare with the US

* NEVER mix infant formula with fluoridated tap water for example, as this may overexpose your child to  **100 times**  the proposed "safe" level of fluoride exposure for infants!

* "For over 50 Years, Fluoride Levels Were Too High, Government Admits"  **in April 2015**
