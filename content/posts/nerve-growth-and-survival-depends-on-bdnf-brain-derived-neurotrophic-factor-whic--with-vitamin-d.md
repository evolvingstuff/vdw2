> “BDNF itself is important for long-term memory.”

> “Various studies have shown possible links between BDNF and conditions, such as depression,<sup>[63]</sup><sup>[64]</sup> schizophrenia,<sup>[65]</sup> obsessive-compulsive disorder,<sup>[66]</sup> Alzheimer's disease,<sup>[67]</sup> Huntington's disease,<sup>[68]</sup> Rett syndrome,<sup>[69]</sup> and dementia,<sup>[70]</sup> as well as anorexia nervosa<sup>[71]</sup> and bulimia nervosa.<sup>[72]</sup>
