Note from PDF: A 3X increase in dementia for men aged 50-55 who had early ostoporosis

Do not recall hearing of this association before

Speculations by VitaminDWiki as to the causes include

* APOE4 gene (speculation by the study)

* Low Vitamin K  (speculation by the study)

* Osteo drugs increases chance of dementia

* Inflammation increases chance of dementia

* Calcium used for Osteo increases chance of dementia

   * [Calcium supplements INCREASE heart problems](/posts/calcium-supplements-proven-to-not-reduce-fractures-but-are-proven-to-increase-heart-problems)

* Both Osteo and Dementia were increased due to poor Vitamin D Receptor

   * [Osteoporosis 2.8 X more likely if Vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes altered â€“ Aug 2013](/posts/osteoporosis-28-x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-receptor-vdr-genes-altered)

Background:There has been in recent decades a growing interest in the relationship between osteoporosis and cognitive decline. 

Objective:The goal of this study was to analyze the impact of osteoporosis on the risk of dementia in patients followed for up to 20 years in general practices in Germany. 

Methods:This study included patients who received an initial diagnosis of osteoporosis and were followed by 1,215 general practitioners in Germany between January 1993 and December 2012 (index date). Controls were matched (1:1) to osteoporosis patients using propensity scores based on age, gender, index year, comorbidities, and co-therapies. Kaplan-Meier curves were performed to study the development of dementia separately in men and women with or without osteoporosis within 20 years of the index date. Cox proportional regression models were used to estimate the relationship between osteoporosis and dementia in men and women. 

Results:The present study included 29,983 cases and 29,983 controls. After 20 years of follow-up, 20.5% of women with osteoporosis and 16.4% of controls had been diagnosed with dementia (log-rank p-value <0.001). 

At the end of the follow-up period, dementia was found in  **22.0% of men**  previously diagnosed with osteoporosis and  **14.9% of men without**  this chronic condition (log-rank p-value <0.001). Osteoporosis was associated with a 1.2-fold increase in the risk of being diagnosed with dementia in women and a 1.3-fold increase in the risk of being diagnosed with dementia in men. 

Conclusions: There was a positive association between osteoporosis and dementia in patients followed in general practices in Germany.
