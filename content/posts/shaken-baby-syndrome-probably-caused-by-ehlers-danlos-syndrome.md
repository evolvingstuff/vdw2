#### What is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? [Dr. Holick, Aug 2024](https://drmichaelholick.org/what-is-ehlers-danlos-syndrome/)

* "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type: An Autosomal Dominant Genetic Disorder That Has Numerous Health Consequences That Is Poorly Understood by the Medical Community"

* "At this time there have been 13 different forms of EDS described"

* "EDS hypermobility type (hEDS) is the most common form.

   * Although it has been stated that one in 3000-5000 have this genetic disorder it is a lot more common as recently suggested i.e.  **1-3% of the population may have evidence for it.** "

* "Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is a autosomal dominant genetic disorder and therefore offspring of one parent having hEDS have a 50% chance of acquiring it whereas if both parents have it the offspring have a 75% chance."

* "Dr. Waney Squier is a renowned British pediatric neuropathologist and considered the UK’s leading scientist in the field of pediatric neuropathology."

* ... in March of 2016 the UK General Medical Council (GMC) found Dr. Waney Squier guilty of “misleading her peers, being irresponsible, dishonest and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute” and she was  **“struck off the medical register”**  which prevented her from practicing medicine.

* ...in October 2016, Dr. Waney Squier won her appeal and was reinstated. However, although Dr. Squier’s name was returned to the medical register, she has been prevented from giving evidence as an expert witness for another three years, which many believe was her punishment for standing up to the establishment."
