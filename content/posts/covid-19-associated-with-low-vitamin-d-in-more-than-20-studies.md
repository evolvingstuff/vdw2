**Rapid Response to:** 

Low vitamin D: high risk COVID-19 mortality? Seven preprints suggest that is case. Does low ‘D’ put BAME and elderly, at particular COVID-19 risk? Testing and Data Required.

 **Dear Editor** 

BMJ rapid response letters and supporting references  <sup>[1, 2]</sup> posited vitamin D deficiency disease features in COVID-19 severity and mortality risks. <sup>[3]</sup> Brown and Sakar, <sup>[4]</sup> in March, suggested vitamin D plasma deficiency differentials may help account for mortality rate differences between European countries.

There are now seven observational preprints (Abstracts and links below), based on COVID-19 positive patient data, indicating vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, do indeed factor significantly in COVID-19 severity and mortality – for example, and thought provokingly, 10 to 20 times increases were seen in ICU and mortality in Asian studies. <sup>[5, 6]</sup> One further USA based study observes vitamin D may factor in COVID-19 infection. <sup>[7]</sup> Whilst differing in, size and exact approach, results of all preprints point clearly in the same direction.

Concerningly, vitamin D is often low in high-risk COVID-19-groups, such as, BAME including African Americans, elderly in care-homes, and the obese. Low vitamin D is also increasingly common in young. <sup>[8]</sup> Studies suggest low ‘D’ factors in Kawasaki disease <sup>[9, 10, 11]</sup> ; occurrences are increasingly being linked with COVID-19. <sup>[12,13]</sup>

Vitamin D is a nutrient-hormone with a multiplicity of roles, well evidenced in voluminous and wide-reaching literature, spanning over a hundred years. The primary, and evolutionarily determined, source of vitamin D, including in; humans (D3), pets, livestock, and plants (D2), is not diet, but appropriate sun exposure. Dietary sources of vitamin D are limited, and particularly so for vegans and non ovo-lacto vegetarians. <sup>[14]</sup> Twenty minutes of sensible non-burning sunbathing by pale-skinned-humans, can produce 20,000 IU <sup>[15]</sup>; equivalent to 50 days intake of 400 IU supplementation. Production rate depends on skin pigmentation and other factors including gender. UVB blocking creams inhibit vitamin D production. Fat tissue accretes and stores vitamin D, reducing vitamin D in plasma.

Biology, physiology, and research, has proved that vitamin D has multiple roles, including in regulation of gene transcription, and inter-alia as a crucial factor in immune and respiratory function. The seven observational studies to date, using COVID-19 positive patient data, assessing the impact of vitamin D on COVID-19 severity and mortality, are listed and quoted below:

South Asia (Raharusun) <sup>[5]</sup>– preprint; ‘Patterns of COVID-19 Mortality and Vitamin D: An Indonesian Study’ - 780 COVID-19 positive patient cases concluded, “When controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, Vitamin D status is strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality outcome of cases.” Unadjusted increased risk of death in ‘D’ insufficient 12.55 (7.63 adjusted) and ‘D’ deficient 19.12 (10.12 adjusted).

South Asia (Alipio) <sup>[6]</sup> - preprint; ‘Vitamin D supplementation could possibly improve clinical outcomes of patients infected with Coronavirus-2019 (Covid-2019)’ - 212 COVID-19 patients, noted, “the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a severe outcome were approximately 7.94 times (OR=0.126, p<0.001) while interestingly, the odds of having a mild clinical outcome rather than a critical outcome were approximately 19.61 times (OR=0.051, p<0.001).”

India (Glicio) <sup>[16]</sup>– preprint; ‘Vitamin D Level of Mild and Severe Elderly Cases of COVID-19: A Preliminary Report’ - 176 COVID-19 patients age > 60, noted, “Majority of subjects classified as severe had 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/ml.”

USA (Lau) <sup>[17]</sup> – preprint; ‘Vitamin D insufficiency is prevalent in severe COVID-19’ – 20 COVID-19 patients noted, “VDI is highly prevalent in severe COVID-19 patients. VDI and severe COVID-19 share numerous associations including hypertension, obesity, male sex, advanced age, concentration in northern climates, coagulopathy, and immune dysfunction.”

Belgium (De Smet) <sup>[18]</sup> – preprint; ‘Vitamin D deficiency as risk factor for severe COVID-19: a convergence of two pandemics’- 186 COVID-19 confirmed patients noted, “Male COVID-19 patients, however, showed markedly higher percentage of vitamin D deficiency than controls (67.0% versus 49.2%, P=0.0006) and this effect was more pronounced with advanced radiological stage ranging from 55.2% in stage 1 to 74% in stage 3.”

Switzerland (D’Avolio) <sup>[19]</sup> – preprint; ‘25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations Are Lower in Patients with Positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2’ - 107 patients; 27 were COVID-positive; observed, “significantly lower 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.004) were found in PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median value 11.1 ng/mL) patients compared with negative patients (24.6 ng/mL); this was also confirmed by stratifying patients according to age >70 years.”

Ireland (Faul) <sup>[20]</sup> – preprint; ‘Vitamin D Deficiency and ARDS after SARS-CoV-2 Infection’- 33 patients observes, “twelve had a baseline 25OHD level less than 30 nmol.l-1. In patients with SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia a baseline serum 25OHD level less than 30 nmol.l-1 was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) for intubation of 3.19 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.05 to 9.7), (p = 0.03).”

It is thus urgent, even arguably imperative, vitamin-D-levels in COVID-19 patients in hospitals and care-homes, particularly the most at risk including, BAME, the elderly, obese, and young including those presenting with Kawasaki disease, are collected, related to outcomes, and reported, to determine if the above preprint data holds more widely.

Observations, not RCTs, resolved human deficiency related diseases, such as, goitre, rickets, beriberi, pellagra, and scurvy. RCTs were not completed before; parachute deployment, recommendations to drink only ‘clean’ water, sun cream approval, social distancing, steps to discourage smoking, or hand washing for infection control. <sup>[21, 22]</sup>

Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is referred to by some as a pandemic, and is a recognised disorder obliging prescribed existing recommended treatments and protocols, including by NICE. <sup>[23]</sup>
