#### Overview of the controversy

<!-- ~tc~ overstart ~/tc~ -->

* A few governments say 10 ng is OK

* Some governments say 20 ng is OK

* Some governments say 30 ng is OK

* Most experts say 40 ng is good

* Some experts say 50 ng is much better for disease prevention

* A few people think that > 80 ng is needed to deal with possible vitamin D restrictions due to genes

   * One doctor found that >80 ng was the right level for 2,000 patients in his clinic

   * [Health problems that run in families are often associated with low vitamin D](/posts/health-problems-that-run-in-families-are-often-associated-with-low-vitamin-d)

* Some experts say 50 ng is too much 

* Some concern that >40 ng may be too much if taking some fixed chemotherapy or not adjust cofactors

* Some experts feel 50 ng is not enough to TREAT some diseases

* Consensus: **<span style="color:#F00;">0 ng is bad</span>**  and  **<span style="color:#090;">30 ng is good/ok</span>** 

 **Notional Graph of Expert Opinions of levels with Vitamin D MONOTHERAPY**

Note: Monotherapy just increases vitamin D levels, and rarely adjusts the cofactor intake (Ca, Mg, Vitamin K2, Omega-3, etc)

#### U Shaped curve due to long follow-up time, not latitude - by Dr. Grant

The U-shaped relationship comes only from prospective studies with long follow-up times. 

In my considered opinion, it is an artifact of the long  follow-up time, not high latitude.
