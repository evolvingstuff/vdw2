## How to record

* Try to record without getting reverberation

* Set it near the sound source: presenter or near a speaker

* You can leave it recording continuously during all presentations - easy to edit the audio later

* Make a test recording ahead of time and play it back to check sound levels, sound quality, reverberation, etc.

## Benefits to a conference for recording:

1. Office-mates, bosses, friends, family, . . .  can see/hear what a particular person presented

1. A way to learn about vitamin D without the time/expensive of travel - experiencing 1, 3, 5, or perhaps all of the presentations

1. A way to advertise the current event, so as to get more future participation

1. Something concrete to show bosses so as to get travel money for future presentations.

## Why presenter would like it to be on the web

1. Office-mates, bosses, friends, family, . . .  a way to see/hear what he/she presented

1. Something concrete to support funding future projects or presentations

1. Initiate communication with other people with similar interests (who could not attend the workshop)

1. Workshop attendees send links of important/interesting presentations to others

## The increase in vitamin D information vs time is starting to look like a hockey stick
