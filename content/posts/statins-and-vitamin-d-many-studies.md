### Deep Research on Statins and Vitamin D - this wepage and the web - Perplexity AI Feb 2025

 **[What is the association between Statins and Vitamin D? Please include information from the attachment](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-association-betwee-_2j8RYd9Swu5NzdpDZOSpw)** 

 **Executive Summary** 

The relationship between statins and vitamin D has emerged as a critical area of investigation due to the widespread use of statins for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency globally. This report synthesizes evidence from clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses to explore the bidirectional interactions between statins and vitamin D. Key findings include statins' modest cardiovascular benefits (1.3% absolute risk reduction in heart attacks)1, their association with musculoskeletal side effects, and the role of vitamin D in mitigating statin-induced myopathy. Paradoxically, while observational studies suggest vitamin D supplementation improves statin tolerance<span>[VDW]</span> [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4525396/) [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5644425/), randomized controlled trials (RCTs) such as the VITAL study found no significant benefit [2](https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2022/11/23/vitamin-d-fails-to-reduce-statin-associated-muscle-pain/) [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9685544/). Mechanistic insights reveal that statins may alter vitamin D metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes, with lipophilic statins like atorvastatin reducing vitamin D levels <span>[VDW]</span> [6](https://journals.viamedica.pl/polish_heart_journal/article/download/79046/59025), whereas others like rosuvastatin increase them [7](https://ijcva.org/articles/is-vitamin-d-level-elevated-in-patients-on-statin-treatment/doi/IJCA.IJCA_42_19) [17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34296397/). Clinical recommendations emphasize individualized approaches, considering vitamin D status in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), though evidence remains contentious.

In recent years, the important role of vitamin D in muscle health maintenance has been highlighted. In addition, hypovitaminosis D is very prevalent and might be a reversible risk factor for SAMS occurrence.

Methods: In our controlled intervention study, patients suffering from both SAMS and hypovitaminosis D underwent vitamin D replacement for 6 months. SAMS intensity and its impact on the quality of life were evaluated with a questionnaire during follow-up. A subgroup of patients who were not at the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target attempted a statin rechallenge after 3 months. Control subjects, with SAMS only, were not treated.

Results: Blood vitamin D levels reached 261% of baseline values.

* Pain intensity was reduced by 63%, and

* all life quality indicators improved.

At follow-up, percentage variations in SAMS intensity and in vitamin D levels were inversely related (r = 0.57, P = 0.002). In a multiple regression analysis, this association was found to be independent. Among the rechallenge subgroup,** 75% successfully tolerated high-intensity statins during the follow-up **. The parameters of interest were unchanged in control subjects.

Conclusions: In our findings, the amount of increase in vitamin D concentrations is directly related to SAMS improvement. Although randomized studies are needed, 25(OH)D levels can be measured and eventually supplemented in all patients suffering from SAMS, and this can be done together with a statin rechallenge after 3 months for patients who are not at the LDL-C target.

BACKGROUND:

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on simvastatin-mediated changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content after exercise in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

METHODS:

Vitamin D-deficient T2DM patients aged 25-50 years performed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks and were randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg daily plus vitamin D 60 000 units once weekly or vitamin D 60 000 units once weekly. The primary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content (citrate synthase activity in the vastus lateralis) following simvastatin and/or vitamin D replacement therapy.

RESULTS:

Twenty-eight patients completed the study. C decreased by 8.4% (P < 0.05) following 12 weeks of simvastatin therapy. Vitamin D supplementation blunted the decline in cardiorespiratory fitness to 0.6% (P < 0.05 for between-group difference in change from baseline).

Similarly, skeletal muscle mitochondrial content decreased by 3.6% with simvastatin but improved by 12.1% on supplementation with vitamin D, although the between-group difference was not significant. Vitamin D alone increased cardiorespiratory fitness and mitochondrial content by 7.1% (P < 0.05) and 16.7%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:

Simvastatin tends to cause deterioration in exercise-associated cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content in adults with T2DM, which is blunted by vitamin D supplementation.

### People taking statins have 1.5 ng more Vitamin D (after adjustment) - July 2020** The Effect of Statins on Serum Vitamin D Concentrations Among Older Adults **Cureus. 2020 Jul 1;12(7):e8950. [doi: 10.7759/cureus.8950.](https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8950.)

Carlos H Orces 1, Martha Montalvan 2 3 4, Daniel Tettamanti 5 6 7

Background Randomized and observational studies have previously reported inconsistent results for the direct association between statin therapy and 25 hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the relationship between statin use and 25(OH)D and its metabolites concentrations in a large nationally representative sample of older adults.

Methods This study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were asked to show the medication containers of all the products used in the previous 30 days, and the prescription of statins was defined on the three-level nested therapeutic classification scheme of Cerner Multum's Lexicon. General linear models adjusted for potential confounders were created to compare 25(OH)D concentrations between older adults taking statins and those who did not.

Results A total of 6,261 participants with a mean age of 69.5 years comprised the study sample. Of those, 40.2% were taking statins with a median length of therapy of 5 years.** Adjusted mean 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D levels were 3.3 and 4.4 nmol/L higher among participants taking statins than those who did not **, respectively. Moreover, this association was consistently seen regardless of the duration of therapy and particularly in subjects taking simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin. In subgroup analyses according to BMI categories and vitamin D intake, higher 25(OH)D levels were also seen among statin users. By contrast, this association was attenuated among those with a daily vitamin D between 400 and 800 and >800 IU.

Conclusion Older adults on statin therapy had significantly higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Additional research should be conducted to define the mechanism of this association and determine if the pleiotropic effects attributed to statins may be mediated by vitamin D.

### 21% less vitamin D in those taking statins - 3 RCT Feb 2017** Statin Use and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Blood Level Response to Vitamin D Treatment of Older Adults. **J Am Geriatr Soc. 2017 Feb 27. [doi: 10.1111/jgs.14784.](https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.14784.)

Bischoff-Ferrari HA1,2, Fischer K1,2, Orav EJ3, Dawson-Hughes B4, Meyer U1,2, Chocano-Bedoya PO1,2, Meyer OW1,2, Ernst R1,2, Schietzel S1,2, Eberli F5, Staehelin HB6, Freystätter G1,2, Roas S1, Theiler R1,2, Egli A1,2, Wilson NM1,2.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether statin use alters the response of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level to vitamin D treatment.

DESIGN: Pooled analysis.

SETTING: Three double-blind randomized controlled trials that tested different doses of vitamin D.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants of three trials (N = 646; mean age 76.3 ± 8.4, 65% female).

MEASUREMENTS: In all three trials, 25(OH)D status and statin use were assessed repeatedly over time (baseline, 6 and 12 months). Repeated-measures analysis was used to compare 25(OH)D responses to vitamin D treatment at baseline and 6 and 12 months of statin users and nonusers, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, vitamin D dose, trial, and season.

RESULTS: At baseline, 17.5% were statin users, and 65% were vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL). Baseline 25(OH)D levels did not differ significantly between groups at baseline (18.8 for statin users, 17.2 ng/mL for nonusers, P = .07), but according to the longitudinal analyses, the total increase over 12 months in 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in statin users (13.1 ng/L) than nonusers (15.9 ng/mL; 21.4% difference; P = .009).** CONCLUSION: Of persons aged 60 and older at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, statin users had a 21.4% smaller increase in 25(OH)D serum concentrations over time than nonusers, independent of vitamin D dose and other covariates. **PMID: 28240766 DOI: 10.1111/jgs.14784** Publisher will rent the PDF for $6 **---

### Do statins increase the level of vitamin D in the blood in the short term?** Question: Is this a direct effect, or is it due to statins reducing cholesterol, which is needed to produce vitamin D from the skin, but cholesterol is not needed if the vitamin D is taken as a supplement **** Some people appear to think that vitamin D could serve the same function as statins at a much lower cost and much lower risk. **** Note: one statin is the top-selling US prescription drug - with more sales than the next two top-selling drugs **<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/list-of-best-selling-drugs-wikipedia---2006.gif" alt="image">

### Vitamin D reduces Statin pain - review April 2019** Vitamin D Supplementation to Treat Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms: A Review. **Sr Care Pharm. 2019 Apr 1;34(4):253-257. doi 10.4140/TCP.n.2019.253.

Lowe K, Kubra KT, He ZY, Carey K.

For the past 15 years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States and worldwide. With an aging population, there has been increasing use of statin therapy to reduce the risk of CVD. However, statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) remain an obstacle to this treatment, leading to discontinuation and nonadherence to statin therapy. Signs and symptoms of SAMS include muscle pain, tenderness, and increased serum creatine kinase. Despite the idiopathic pathophysiology of SAMS, some studies have shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and SAMS; the use of vitamin D supplements can lead to relief of these symptoms. The purpose of this review was to critique evidence for the association between low serum vitamin D and SAMS and the use of vitamin D supplementation for treatment.

### Statins associated with low vitamin D - Dec 2015** Statin therapy and Vitamin D **Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol. 2015; 4(6): 1113-1117[doi: 10.18203/2319-2003.ijbcp20151342](https://doi.org/10.18203/2319-2003.ijbcp20151342)

Background: Statins are well-known drugs used in dyslipidemia and cardiac disorders for several years. Recently, it has been reported that long-term use of statins reduces serum vitamin D levels. When statins are administered to patients with low vitamin D, more muscular side effects have been reported. On the contrary, a few studies report that statins might increase vitamin D levels competing with its metabolism. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the association between statins and vitamin D.

Methods: 125 participants who fulfilled the selection criteria were enrolled in the study. 65 subjects belonged to the control group and 60 to the statin group. The blood sample was collected for Vitamin D estimation. The results were correlated with a demographic profile, the nature of statin, and the muscular side effects and compared with the control group.

Results: The mean vitamin D level in the statin group was 15.82 ng/ml±11.51 and 20.57 ng/ml±7.007 in the control group. The difference was found to be statistically significant. 13.85% in the control group and 10% in the statin group had sufficient vitamin D levels. 18.33% and 36.92 % had insufficient levels, and 71.67% and 49.23% had a deficiency in the statin and control groups, respectively. Myalgia was reported by 30 among 60 subjects (50%) in the statin group and 5 among 65 subjects (7.69%) in the control group.

Conclusion: The present study has shown that statin therapy is associated with low vitamin D levels and that this could contribute to the increased incidence of myalgia in the statin group.** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/statin-and-vitamin-d.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> **---

### Statin intolerance ==> statin tolerance after adding lots of vitamin D - March 2016** ID: 86: SAFETY OF 50,000-100,000 UNITS OF VITAMIN D3 PER WEEK IN VITAMIN D DEFICIENT, HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC PATIENTS WITH STATIN INTOLERANCE **Journal of Investigative Medicine

V Jetty, G Duhon, P Shah, M Prince, K Lee, M Goldenberg, A Kumar, CJ Glueck, P Wang

DOI: 10.1136/jim-2016-000120.39 Published 22 March 2016

Background In ∼85–90% of statin-intolerant patients, vitamin D deficiency (serum 25 (OH) D <32 ng/ml) is a reversible cause of statin intolerance, usually requiring 50,000 to 100,000 units of vitamin D/week continuously to normalize serum vitamin D, and thus successfully allow reinstitution of statins which previously could not be tolerated because of myalgia-myositis.

Specific Aim In 274 statin-intolerant patients, all with low entry serum vitamin D (<32 ng/ml, median 21 ng/ml), we assessed safety and efficacy of vitamin D supplementation (50,000–100,000 units/week) over treatment periods of 3 months (n=274), 3 and 6 months (n=161), 3, 6, and 9 months (n=58), and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (n=22).

Results In the 385 patients with a 3-month follow-up, taking mean 61,000 and median 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/week, median serum vitamin D rose from 20 to 42 ng/ml (p<0.0001); vitamin D became high (>100 ng/ml) but not toxic-high (>150 ng/ml) in 4 patients (1.0%) (101, 102, 106, 138 ng/ml). Median serum calcium was unchanged from entry (9.6 mg/dl) to 9.6 at 3 months. On vitamin D supplementation, the trend of change in serum calcium from normal-to-high or from high to normal did not significantly differ (McNemar S=1.0, p=0.32), and there was no significant trend in change of the calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from entry to follow-up (McNemar S=2.6, p=0.11).

In the 161 patients with 3 and 6-month follow-up, taking mean 67,000 and median 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/week, median entry serum vitamin D rose from 21 to 42 to 44 ng/ml (p<0.0001), serum vitamin D was high (>100 but <150 ng/ml) in 2 patients at 3 months (1.2%, 101, 102 mg/ml) and in 3 (1.9%) at 6 months (101, 140, 140 ng/ml). Median serum calcium was unchanged from entry (9.7 mg/dl) at 3 and 6 months (9.7, 9.6 mg/dl, p>0.05). On vitamin D supplementation, the change in serum calcium from normal-to-high or high-to-normal was no significant trend (McNemar S=0.7, p=0.41), and no trend in change of eGFR (McNemar S=1.3, p=0.26).

In the 58 patients with 3, 6, and 9-month follow-up on mean and median 71,000 and 100,000 IU of D3/week, median entry vitamin D rose from 20 to 37, 41, and 44 ng/ml (p<0.0001), with 1 (1.7%, 102 ng/ml), 2 (3.5%, 140, 140 ng/ml), and 0 (0%) patients high. Median serum calcium was unchanged from entry, median 9.7, 9.8, 9.6, and 9.6 mg/dl. On vitamin D supplementation, the trend of change in serum calcium from normal-to-high or high-to-normal was not significant (McNemar S=1.8, p=0.18), and no trend in change of eGFR (McNemar S=2, p=0.16).

In the 22 patients with follow-up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months on mean and median 70,000 and 75,000 IU of D3/week, median serum vitamin D rose from 20 to 37, to 41, to 44, and to 43 ng/ml (p<0.0001), with 1 (5%, 102 ng/ml) high, 2 (9%, 140, 140) high, 0 (0%) high, and 1 (5%, 126 ng/ml) high. Serum calcium was unchanged, median at entry 9.6, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 9.7, 9.7, 9.5, and 9.7 mg/ml. At entry, serum calcium was normal in 21, none high, and one became high at 12-month follow-up. The trend of change in eGFR was insignificant, McNemar S=1.0, p=0.32.

When serum D rose above 100 ng/ml in the few cases, as above, it fell into the normal range within 2 weeks by reducing the vitamin D dose by 50%.

Conclusions When 50,000–100,000 units of vitamin D/week are given to reverse statin intolerance in statin-intolerant patients with low entry vitamin D (<32 ng/ml), it appears to be safe over up to 1-year follow-up, without toxic high serum vitamin D levels >150 ng/ml, and levels rarely >100 ng/ml, and without changes in serum calcium or eGFR.

### 15% more likely to continue to take statins if they have a monthly 100,000 IU Vitamin D supplement - RCT April 2018** Effects of vitamin D supplementation on adherence and persistence with long-term statin therapy: Secondary analysis from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ViDA study **Atherosclerosis, online 7 April 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2018.04.009

Zhenqiang Wua, Carlos A. Camargo Jr.b, Kay-Tee Khaw, Debbie Waayera, Carlene M.M. Lawesa, Les Toopd, Robert Scragga, ,** Highlights **•Long-term use of statins lowers cholesterol and prevents cardiovascular disease.

•Adherence to taking statins is compromised by adverse effects such as myalgia.

•Adherence and persistence to statin use were assessed in a vitamin D trial.

•Monthly vitamin D3 supplementation improved persistence in taking statins.

Results: Overall, 2494 participants were on long-term statins at follow-up (vitamin D = 1243, placebo = 1251). Compared with placebo, monthly vitamin D supplementation did not improve the proportion with adherence (risk ratio: 1.01, p=0.62) but improved the persistence probability of taking all statins after 24 months (hazard ratio: 1.15, p=0.02). In further analyses, significant differences were observed in the adherence to simvastatin, the first-line statin therapy.

Conclusions: Monthly vitamin D supplementation improved persistence with taking statins over a 24-month measurement period in older adults on long-term statin therapy, especially for participants on simvastatin. The role of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunct therapy for patients on long-term statins merits further investigation.

### JAMA is finally questioning Statins - 2016** [Nov 15 2016 - JAMA](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/issue/316/19) is finally questioning Statins **** Four of the papers in that issue (Free online PDFs) *** What to Believe and Do About Statin-Associated Adverse Effects

* Statins for Primary Prevention in Older Adults - Uncertainty and the Need for More Evidence

* Evolving Approaches for Statins in Primary Prevention- Progress, but Questions Remain

*** Statins for Primary Prevention - The Debate Is Intense, but the Data Are Weak **> "The evidence for treating asymptomatic persons with statins does not appear to merit a grade B or even a grade C recommendation.”

> “Benefits of any preventive therapy accrue according to the risk of disease (greater benefit in higher-risk patients). The harms of therapy usually distribute equally overall risk levels. Thus, persons at low risk have little chance of benefit but equal chance of harms and thus are more likely to have net harm.”

> “Other studies have estimated that closer to 20% of statin users have muscle problems.”

> “The decision aid <span>[available from the Mayo Clinic website]</span> shows that of 100 people who take a statin for 5 years, only 2 of 100 will avoid a myocardial infarction, and 98 of the 100 will not experience any benefit.”

> “At the same time, 5 to 20 of the 100 will experience muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and increased risk of diabetes.”

> “The rate of statin use for primary prevention among persons older than 79 years had increased from 8.8% in 2000 to 34.1% in 2012.”

> The** number needed to treat **is 244 for the target group and is much worse for younger women and the elderly.
