### Highlights (By GrassrootsHealth)

* In 1933 common medicine recognized 133 different conditions that were treated by sunlight.

* Sun exposure is healthy! (Watch this video to understand how the sun works and not burn.)

* In the winter the sun is at too low of an angle over most of the US (above Los Angeles/Atlanta) and all of Canada for us to produce vitamin D from sun exposure.

* Cats don't make vitamin D.

* Reptiles have sun lamps for their health.

* Diet alone won't provide enough vitamin D to become vitamin D sufficient.

* Sunscreen reduces vitamin D production by 98%.

* Black (dark) skin pigment needs 5-10 times more sun exposure than Caucasian (light) skin pigment to produce the same amount of vitamin D.

### Holick Podcast at Vitamin D Council Feb 2015

 **[Vitamin D Podcast 06: Dr. Michael Holick](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/blog/vitamin-d-podcast-06-dr-michael-holick/)** 

 **Notes by VitaminDWiki** 

* 291 genes activated - in just the white blood cells - unknown in other portions of the body

> Grant request in process to update the test: using 600 IU, 4,000 IU and 10,000 IU

* Many of the genes were activated above the 20 ng  level recommended by the IoM

* 3,000 IU daily – his general recommendation  

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Confusion 50,000 IU twice a week? Does not compute) 

* Many benefits of sunlight over and above the benefits of vitamin D – see video

* Nitic oxide allows you to relax 

* Holick testified in two cases of child abuse/broken bones.  

> He has been involved in 20 cases

> Black moms so low during pregnancy that unlikely that infant could have gotten normal  bone density.  During the birthing process the ribs could fracture.  Rickets – lucer zones (sp?) can look like fractures in children with rickets.   Not really fractures. Dr. Holick won both cases = child given back to parents.

* Lax joints – person feels that they can bend joints backward.  This can lead to osteo problems later in life.  

> EDS – underdiagnosed.  Perhaps lots of people in Yoga.  Estimated 1 in 1,000 have EDS 

> EDS = [Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndrome)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Wikipedia: People who suffer from EDS are often misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and other conditions

> EDS – also have bone fractures – often unaware of them.

* His day: start 3AM. Clinic starting 8AM, 

> Has setup 4 biomedical companies, and 2 recently

> About 60% of his day involves vitamin D

* He suspects that genes are turned on/off due to visible light in the body.  Visible light can get to the heart, etc.  There can be whole systems of interactions like vitamin D system that we are not aware of.

* He suspects that < 10% of the molecules in the blood have been identified

* Sunlight is important,  We feel better in sunlight

* People can become addicted to sugar, cigarettes, suntan parlors, – lots of things.  But most tanners are not addicted.

* Holick is against the high pressure tanning beds (which are also more expensive) which have only UVA – all downside, no health upside.  

> If use a tanning bed totally cover face and use only about 50% of the suggested session time

* No need to test vitamin D – just supplement. 

* Probable 10,000 IU upper limit – unless extenuating circumstance like obesity

Other professionals.wonder if EDS is the cause
