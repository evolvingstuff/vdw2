#### Study name Radiosensitization of breast cancer cells by Vitamin D3 and Vitamin D analogs

A new study recently presented at the annual  American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Meeting in Washington,  D.C. has reported that [vitamin D3](http://foodforbreastcancer.com/articles/how-important-is-vitamin-d-before-and-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis%3f)can enhance sensitivity to [radiation treatment](http://foodforbreastcancer.com/articles/what-should-breast-cancer-patients-eat-during-radiation-treatment%3f)in breast cancer cells, thereby increasing the proportion of breast  cancer cells killed by radiation. Previous studies conducted by the authors demonstrated that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-di hydroxy  vitamin D3 (D3), or its analogs such as EB 1089, can confer enhanced  sensitivity to ionizing radiation. (The vitamin D3 sold to consumers in  supplement form is cholecalciferol, which is metabolized in the human  body to calcitriol, otherwise known as 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D3.) The  present study was designed to extend the previous findings to ZR-75-1  breast cancer cells (a p53 wild type ER positive cell line) using D3  combined with ionizing radiation.

The effects of D3 alone, ionizing radiation delivered over a period  of 3 days, and D3 administered 72 hours prior to radiation treatment  were evaluated.

Radiation alone was found to reduce total cell number by  approximately 30%. 

 **Pretreatment with D3 enhanced radiation sensitivity,  so that the combination reduced total cell number by approximately 75%.** 

Cell death was followed by a prolonged period of growth arrest under either ionizing radiation treatment alone or ionizing radiation preceded  by D3. 

Surviving cells were in a state of senescence after having undergone either regimen. 

Taken together with the authors' previous  work, the results support the theory that D3 or its analogs 

enhance radiation sensitivity in breast cancer cells through the promotion of multiple cell death pathways.

Comments regarding the study

The authors attempt to uncover the mechanism of action by which  cancer cell death occurred in the study. They provide evidence that the  cell death was not normal apoptosis in cells treated either with  ionizing radiation alone or pretreated with D3. They also reject  autophagy, a type of cell self-digestion which can lead to cell death,  as responsible for radiation sensitization in this experiment. In fact,  they speculate that autophagy may prove to be cytoprotective instead of  cytotoxic and could be involved in regulating senescence. They note that  the addition of vitamin D markedly increased the formation of cells  with small, double nuclei, which is indicative of mitotic catastrophe.

Vitamin D has been shown to influence the expression of breast  cancer-related gene activity, including cell differentiation, cell  growth, and angiogenesis, all of which are related to cancer development  and progression. While some compounds that prevent breast cancer can  actually be harnessed for use by cancer cells in ways that promote tumor  growth or metastasis once a tumor has become established, vitamin D  appears to act synergistically to increase cancer cell death during  chemotherapy and adjuvant hormonal treatment, as well as radiation  treatment for breast cancer.

The present study was designed to examine how  vitamin D can enhance sensitivity to radiation treatment in breast  cancer cells. Previous studies conducted by the authors demonstrated  that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D3 (D3), or  its analogs such as EB 1089, can confer enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation. (The vitamin D3 sold to consumers in supplement form is  cholecalciferol, which is metabolized in the human body to calcitriol,  otherwise known as 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D3.) The present study was  designed to extend the previous findings to ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells  (a p53 wild type ER positive cell line) using D3 combined with ionizing radiation. The effects of 100nM D3 alone, fractionated ionizing  radiation (5 x 2 Gy) delivered over a period of 3 days, and 100nM D3 72  hours prior to ionizing radiation were evaluated. Radiation alone was  found to reduce total cell number by approximately 30%. Pretreatment with D3 enhanced radiation sensitivity, so that the combination reduced  total cell number by approximately 75%. There was no evidence of  apoptosis in cells treated either with ionizing radiation alone or  pretreated with D3 (as evidenced by an absence of nuclear fragmentation  or chromatin condensation or cleavage of caspase-3). Cell death was  followed by a prolonged period of growth arrest under either ionizing  radiation treatment alone or ionizing radiation preceded by D3. Positive  ?-galactosidase staining, cell flattening and enlargement demonstrated  that surviving cells after undergoing either regimen were in a state of senescence. Autophagy did not appear to be responsible for radiation  sensitization in this experiment. Surprisingly, the formation of binucleated cells with micronuclei (morphology indicative of mitotic  catastrophe) was evident primarily in cells pretreated with D3 prior to  ionizing radiation but not in cells treated with ionizing radiation  alone. The authors conclude that pretreatment with vitamin D3 has the  capacity to radiosensitize ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells by increasing the  rate and extent of cell killing. Residual surviving cells after both  radiation treatment alone and vitamin D pre-treatment appear to be in a  state of prolonged growth arrest or senescence. While the initial mode  of cell death has yet to be determined, it appears that mitotic  catastrophe may play a role in vitamin D3â€™s radiosensitization of  ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Taken together with the authors' previous  work, the results support the theory that D3 or its analogs enhance radiation sensitivity in breast cancer cells through the promotion of multiple cell death pathways.
