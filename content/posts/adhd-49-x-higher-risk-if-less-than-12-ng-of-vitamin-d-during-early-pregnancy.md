Objective:

The objective was to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cord blood and pregnancy and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in 5-year-old offspring.

Method:

In Odense Child Cohort, Denmark, 944 mother–child pairs had data on pregnancy or cord serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parent-rated attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score by Child Behavior Checklist for ages 1.5–5 years. Adjusted multiple linear regression and two-stage exposure analyses were performed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D associations to the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score.

Results:

The mean (standard deviation) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cord blood was 48.0 (21.8) nmol/L; early pregnancy was 65.5 (20.2) nmol/L and late pregnancy was 79.3 (25.7) nmol/L. The median (interquartile range) age of child at examination was 5.2 (5.1–5.4) years and median (interquartile range) attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score was 2 (0–3) points. In adjusted analyses, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of <25 nmol/L and <32 nmol/L in cord blood and <25 nmol/L in early pregnancy was associated with 0.9 <span>[95% confidence interval: 0.4, 1.3]</span>, 0.5 <span>[0.1, 0.9]</span> and 2.1 <span>[0.8, 3.4]</span> points higher attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score vs reference. In the two-stage exposure analysis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score decreased by 0.4 points per 25 nmol/L increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 

Moreover, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of <25 nmol/L in early pregnancy and cord was associated with a five-fold and a two-fold risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score ⩾90th percentile, adjusted odds ratio <span>[95% confidence interval]</span> = **4.9**  <span>[1.3, 19.0]</span> and 2.2 <span>[1.2, 3.9]</span>.

Conclusion:

In this cohort, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <25 nmol/L in cord blood and early pregnancy were risk factors for higher attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptom score in 5-year-old children, suggesting a protective effect of vitamin D on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder traits at preschool age.
