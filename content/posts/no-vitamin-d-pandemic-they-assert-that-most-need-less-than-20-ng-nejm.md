Christine L. Taylor, Ph.D.

I purchased the NEJM paper ($20) which dozens of websites were reporting on

 **Report content was virtually identical due to copying from a NEJM news release.** 

Example titles include

* Too many people are worried about vitamin D deficiency, experts say

> "Only 13 percent of Americans aged 1 to 70 are at risk of being deficient in vitamin D — and less than 6 percent are deficient."

* Vitamin D deficiency is widely overestimated, doctors warn"

* Vitamin D deficiency may be widely overestimated

* Doctors warn about overdosing on Vitamin D

* Don’t Worry About Getting More Vitamin D, Doctors Reassure

* Why you probably don't need more Vitamin D

* Too many people are being told they have a vitamin D deficiency

The paper cannot be posted on the web - The paper is behind a $20 paywall

 **My comment** 

They think that  **600 IU** will provide 97% of the non-seniors (including obese, pregnant, dark skinned, etc) with enough Vitamin D (for bone health).  They believe that 97% of non-seniors need LESS than 20 ng (for bone health)

"Less than 6% are deficient in vitamin D [serum 25(OH)D levels <12.5 ng per milliliter"

&nbsp; &nbsp; Their reference is the IoM report - that data for which is now 8 years out of date

 **Here are a few papers papers which strongly disagree** 

* Bone fractures reduced by a minimum of  **800 IU**  vitamin D and Calcium – meta-meta-analysis March 2014

* Professor who concluded that vitamin D ( **800 IU** ) does not help bones got 324,000 dollar prize- Nov 2015

* Bone health best with  **40 nanograms**  of vitamin D – Oct 2015

*  **800 IU** Vitamin D proven again to not be enough to stop bone loss - Aug 2015
