Background

Vitamin D is a multifunctional pro-hormone and has widespread actions in human body. Several studies showed a possible association between vitamin D deficiency and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but no definite conclusion was available.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively assess the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data from eligible studies were pooled using meta-analysis.

Results

Six studies that involved a total of 1,484 type 2 diabetic patients were finally included into the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that there were obviously decreased serum 25(OH)D levels in DPN patients [weighted mean difference (WMD) =  **−6.36 ng/ml** , 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) −8.57 to −4.14, P < 0.00001](weighted%20mean%20difference%20(WMD)%20=%20__−6.36%20ng/ml__,%2095%20%%20confidence%20interval%20(95%20%%20CI)%20−8.57%20to%20−4.14,%20P%20<%200.00001). 

Vitamin D deficiency was also significantly associated with increased risk of DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes <span>[odds ratio (OR) __2.88__, 95 % CI 1.84–4.50, P < 0.00001]</span>. 

Meta-analysis of three studies with adjusted estimates showed that vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with increased risk of DPN in patients with type 2 diabetes ( **OR 2.68** , 95 % CI 1.67–4.30, P < 0.0001). Sensitivity analysis showed that there was no obvious change in the pooled estimates.

Conclusion

Vitamin D is involved in the development of DPN in type 2 diabetic patients, and vitamin D deficiency is very likely to be associated with DPN in type 2 diabetic patients. Further studies are needed to validate the association between vitamin D deficiency and DPN.
