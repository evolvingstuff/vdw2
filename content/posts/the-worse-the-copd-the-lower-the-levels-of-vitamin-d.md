OBJECTIVE:

To survey the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to determine the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the quality of life in COPD patients.

METHODS:

Thirty-six patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD group), 38 outpatients with stable COPD (stable COPD group), and 30 healthy subjects (control group) in the Third Hospital of Changsha were enrolled in our study from Dec. 2011 to Mar. 2012. The serum levels of 25-(OH)D were measured in all subjects by ELISA. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was calculated and compared among the 3 groups. Scores of COPD assessment test (CAT) were measured and compared in the AECOPD group and the stable COPD group and the relation between 25-(OH)D and CAT scores was analyzed.

RESULTS:

1) The levels of 25-(OH)D in the AECOPD group and the stable COPD group were significantly lower than those in the control group. 

The level of 25-(OH)D in the AECOPD group was significantly lower than that in the stable COPD group (P<0.05). 

2) The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 52.78% in the AECOPD group and that was 39.47% in the stable COPD group. 

The total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 45.95% in COPD patients. 

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 16.67% in the control group. 

There was significant difference in the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among the 3 groups (P<0.05).

3) The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the AECOPD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.01) and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the stable COPD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05). 

There was no significant difference between the AECOPD group and the stable COPD group (P>0.05). 

4) significant difference was found between the AECOPD group and the stable COPD group in CAT scores (P<0.01). 

5) Both in the AECOPD group and the stable COPD group, the 25-(OH)D levels were negatively correlated with CAT scores (r=-0.603, P<0.01; r=-0.549, P<0.01, respectively).

CONCLUSION:

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in COPD patients. Vitamin D deficiency may have negative impact on the life quality in COPD patients.
