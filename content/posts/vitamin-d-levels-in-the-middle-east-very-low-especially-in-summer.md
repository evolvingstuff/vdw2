Despite ample sunshine,Vitamin D deficiency is reported from several countries in middle east(1). We describe the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients who were seen in the outpatient clinics of Al Zahra Hospital, Sharjah, UAE over a period of 14 months.

Methods: We analyzed the demographic profile of all patients who had 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels tested at the Al Zahra hospital, Sharjah from January 2010 to February 2011.Severity of vitamin D deficiency was determined based on the serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D level.Total 25<span>[OH]</span>D level in serum was measured using Diasorin chemiluminescence assay (normal range 75-200 nmol/L).Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels below 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Levels between 50-75 nmol/L (20-30 ng/mL)was taken as vitamin D insufficiency and above 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), normal. Patients with 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels below 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL) were considered to have severe vitamin D deficiency.The mean 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels in different nationalities, age groups and in men and women were compared.Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 10.0 statistical software.

Results: Serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels were available for 3449 patients. Mean age(±SD) of the population tested was 38.6 ±13.4 years. Male to female ratio was 1:3.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">{Wonder: are there so many women in the Middle East hospitals due to such low levels of vitamin D?}</span>** 

More than 60 nationalities were represented and were divided into 5 groups – UAE nationals, Non UAE Arabs, Caucasians, South Asians, Others.

The mean (±SD) 25<span>[OH]</span>D level was 30.34 ± 18.09 nmol/L. 

Only 111 patients (3.2%) had normal vitamin D levels. 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">{97% have less than 30 ng}</span>** 

Vitamin D insufficiency was present in 399 patients (11.6%) and 

deficiency in 2939 patients (85.2%). 

Nearly half of all the patients tested had  **severe vitamin D deficiency**  (n 1629; 47.2%).

The 25 <span>[OH]</span>D level was low in both sexes, but it was significantly lower in females compared with males (29.5±18.3 vs 33.5±16.9 nmol/L).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">{probably due to very conservative clothing}</span>** 

Mean 25<span>[OH]</span>D level was  **below normal**  in all nationalities, but was lowest in UAE nationals (27.29nmol/L) and highest in Caucasians (39.97 nmol/L).

Vitamin D level was low across all ages. 

It was relatively better in the first decade (45.8nmol/L).

Mean 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels were higher in January to June period compared with July-December.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">{They REALLY avoid the hot summer sun}</span>** 

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency, including severe vitamin D deficiency, is very common in Sharjah.

Daily supplementation with 400-800 IU of vitamin D is recommended for prophylaxis(2), but higher doses may be needed to keep the 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels above 75 nmol/L.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">People with darker skin typically have lower levels of D</span>** 

1. Dark skin produces less vitamin D per minute than white

1. People with dark skin often want to have lighter skin – so avoid the sun

1. People with dark skin do not feel that they need to tan – so do not seek out the sun

 **<span style="color:#00F;">The average person in Turkey probably has somewhat more vitamin D for at least two reasons</span>** 

1. Patients in the hospital may have been inside for many days – not getting any sun

1. Surgery, trauma, and various diseases which have vicious circles with vitamin D - all decrease the levels of vitamin D
