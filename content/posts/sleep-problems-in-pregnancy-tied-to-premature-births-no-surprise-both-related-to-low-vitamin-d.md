#### [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/well/family/sleep-problems-in-pregnancy-tied-to-premature-births.html?_r=0) Aug 2017 reporting on a study from Obstetrics & Gynecology

* “Over all, women with sleep disorders had a 14.6 percent prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation), compared with 10.9 percent in those without a diagnosis. Those with insomnia had a 30 percent increased risk, and those with sleep apnea a 40 percent increased risk, compared with women without a sleep problem.”

* “Women with insomnia were nearly twice as likely to deliver before 34 weeks gestation.”
