#### <span style="color:#00F;">Drug dosages were established for people with < 30 ng of Vitamin D</span>

 **1) Increased D ==> Increases drug potency  ==>sometimes increases risk of death  
2) Increased D ==> Decreases drug potency ==> sometimes increases risk of death** 

---

#### Increasing vitamin D substantially DECREASES the potency of various medications

* atorvastatin, thiazide diuretic,

---

#### Increased drug ==> Decreased Vitamin D: happens far more frequently than 1) or 2) above

---

#### Note: Most of the mortality increases due to high vitamin D have occurred among the elderly  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; elderly take an average of 6 prescription drugs  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the doses were established for people who had low levels of vitamin D

#### Speculation: Increased Vitamin D increases the interaction between two drugs which a person is taking

 **That is:  
 Drug A + Drug B + LOW level of Vitamin D ==> no problem  
But, Drug A + Drug B + <span style="color:#00F;">HIGH level of Vitamin D ==> a problem</span>**
