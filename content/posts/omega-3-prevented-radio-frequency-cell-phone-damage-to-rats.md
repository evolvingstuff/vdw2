#### Does omega-3 have a protective effect on the rat adrenal gland exposed to 900 MHz electromagnetic fields?

Journal of Microscopy and Ultrastructure. Vol 5, Issue 4, Dec 2017, Pages 185-190. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmau.2017.08.003

<div class="border" style="background-color:#FF9;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:700px">

2 sets of rats were exposed to 1 hour a day of 900 Mhz radio frequency (RF) radiation

Unknown RF dose for 1 hour a day for 15 days

Unknown Omega-3 dose

Unaware of how long before the RF dose the rats got the Omega-3

Far less or perhaps no adrenal gland damage to rats having Omega-3 in their diet

Other studies in PubMed describe Omega-3 protecting additional organs

Note: [Cell phone frequency bands in US and Canada](https://www.signalbooster.com/pages/what-are-the-cellular-frequencies-of-cell-phone-carriers-in-usa-canada) majority are near 900 MHz

The newer cell phones often use a 2X higher frequency – which was not tested by this study

 **Highlights** 

• Effects of EMF on the adrenal gland.

• Morphological alterations as a result of EMF exposure.

• The cortex volume increased in the EMF-exposed groups.

• EMF may have an adverse effect on biological tissues.

• Omg-3 therapy suppresses the effects of EMF.

The aim of this study was to investigate the harmful effects of exposure to 900-megahertz (MHz) electromagnetic fields (EMF) and the protective effects of omega-3 (Omg-3) against EMF in the rat adrenal gland. Eighteen Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned into three groups, control (Cont), EMF, and EMF + Omg-3. The EMF and EMF + Omg-3 groups both consisted of six rats exposed to an EMF of 900 MHz for 60 min/day for 15 days. No procedure was applied to the six rats in the Cont group. At the end of the experiment, all rats were sacrificed, and the mean volumes of the cortex and medulla of the adrenal gland were estimated using a stereological counting technique. The stereological results showed that the mean volume of the adrenal gland increased significantly in the EMF-exposed groups compared to the Cont group. Additionally, the mean volume of the adrenal gland was significantly lower in the EMF + Omg-3 group compared to the EMF group. We suggest that Omg-3 therapy aimed at suppressing the effects of EMF may prove a safe alternative for animals, whether or not they are exposed to EMF.

#### Adrenal volume increases with EMF, similar to noremal for EMF + Omega-3

Fig. 4. After EMF exposure, general structures of cells in the medulla of adrenal gland were impaired, if EMF exposed group is compared to the EMF + Omg-3 exposed. Not only the most of organelles are lost in the EMF exposed group (arrowheads) but also the border of cells in this group cannot be seen clearly. The protective effects of Omg-3 are clearly observed.
