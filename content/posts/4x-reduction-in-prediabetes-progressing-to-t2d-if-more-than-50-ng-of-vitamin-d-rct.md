#### Vitamin D and Risk for Type 2 Diabetes in People With Prediabetes : A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data From 3 Randomized Clinical Trials

Ann Intern Med. 2023 Mar;176(3):355-363. [doi: 10.7326/M22-3018](https://doi.org/10.7326/M22-3018) &nbsp; PDF is behind a paywall

Background: The role of vitamin D in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes remains unclear.

Purpose: To evaluate whether administration of vitamin D decreases risk for diabetes among people with prediabetes.

Data sources: PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception through 9 December 2022.

Study selection: Eligible trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test the effects of oral vitamin D versus placebo on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes.

Data extraction: The primary outcome was time to event for new-onset diabetes. Secondary outcomes were regression to normal glucose regulation and adverse events. Prespecified analyses (both unadjusted and adjusted for key baseline variables) were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Data synthesis: Three randomized trials were included, which tested cholecalciferol, 20 000 IU (500 mcg) weekly; cholecalciferol, 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily; or eldecalcitol, 0.75 mcg daily, versus matching placebos. Trials were at low risk of bias. 

Vitamin D reduced risk for diabetes by 15% (hazard ratio, 0.85 <span>[95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96]</span>) in adjusted analyses, with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (CI, 0.6% to 6.0%). The effect of vitamin D did not differ in prespecified subgroups. 

Among participants assigned to the vitamin D group who maintained an intratrial mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 125 nmol/L (≥50 ng/mL) compared with 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) during follow-up, cholecalciferol  **reduced risk for diabetes by 76%**  (hazard ratio, 0.24 <span>[CI, 0.16 to 0.36]</span>), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 18.1% (CI, 11.7% to 24.6%). 

Vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30% (rate ratio, 1.30 <span>[CI, 1.16 to 1.46]</span>). 

There was no evidence of difference in the rate ratios for adverse events 

* (kidney stones: 1.17 <span>[CI, 0.69 to 1.99]</span>; 

* hypercalcemia: 2.34 <span>[CI, 0.83 to 6.66]</span>; 

* hypercalciuria: 1.65 <span>[CI, 0.83 to 3.28]</span>; 

* death: 0.85 <span>[CI, 0.31 to 2.36]</span>).

Limitations: Studies of people with prediabetes do not apply to the general population. Trials may not have been powered for safety outcomes.

Conclusion: In adults with prediabetes, vitamin D was effective in decreasing risk for diabetes.

Primary funding source: None. (PROSPERO: CRD42020163522).

Background: The role of vitamin D in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes remains unclear.

Purpose: To evaluate whether administration of vitamin D decreases risk for diabetes among people with prediabetes.

Data sources: PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception through 9 December 2022.

Study selection: Eligible trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test the effects of oral vitamin D versus placebo on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes.

Data extraction: The primary outcome was time to event for new-onset diabetes. Secondary outcomes were regression to normal glucose regulation and adverse events. Prespecified analyses (both unadjusted and adjusted for key baseline variables) were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Data synthesis: Three randomized trials were included, which tested cholecalciferol, 20 000 IU (500 mcg) weekly; cholecalciferol, 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily; or eldecalcitol, 0.75 mcg daily, versus matching placebos. Trials were at low risk of bias. 
Vitamin D reduced risk for diabetes by 15% (hazard ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96]) in adjusted analyses, with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (CI, 0.6% to 6.0%). The effect of vitamin D did not differ in prespecified subgroups. 
Among participants assigned to the vitamin D group who maintained an intratrial mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 125 nmol/L (≥50 ng/mL) compared with 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) during follow-up, cholecalciferol __reduced risk for diabetes by 76%__ (hazard ratio, 0.24 [CI, 0.16 to 0.36]), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 18.1% (CI, 11.7% to 24.6%). 
Vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30% (rate ratio, 1.30 [CI, 1.16 to 1.46]). 
There was no evidence of difference in the rate ratios for adverse events 
*(kidney stones: 1.17 [CI, 0.69 to 1.99]; 
*hypercalcemia: 2.34 [CI, 0.83 to 6.66]; 
*hypercalciuria: 1.65 [CI, 0.83 to 3.28]; 
*death: 0.85 [CI, 0.31 to 2.36]).
Limitations: Studies of people with prediabetes do not apply to the general population. Trials may not have been powered for safety outcomes.

Conclusion: In adults with prediabetes, vitamin D was effective in decreasing risk for diabetes.
