#### Poor bone health is a ‘robust’ dementia risk factor [MDEdge](https://www.mdedge.com/neurology/article/262036/alzheimers-cognition/poor-bone-health-robust-dementia-risk-factor?ecd=WNL_MDIQFFF_230331_mdedge)

* "After adjusting for relevant factors, adults with the lowest versus highest BMD at the femoral neck were 42% more likely to develop dementia over roughly 10 years."
