Introduction: Several studies implicate an inverse relationship between 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)Vit D) serum levels and metabolic syndrome (MetS). We sought to investigate a possible relationship between 25(OH)Vit D and emerging risk factors associated with MetS, such as small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) concentration, lipoprotein-associated phos-pholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels.

Material and methods: We studied 110 consecutive otherwise healthy individuals. Of these, 52 were diagnosed with MetS and 58 who did not meet the MetS criteria served as controls. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass analysis was performed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lp-PLA2 activity was determined in total plasma by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation procedure. Serum 25(OH)Vit D was determined quantitatively by an enzyme immunoassay method. 

Results: Metabolic syndrome subjects had significantly lower 25(OH)Vit D levels (11.8 <span>[0.6-48.3]</span> ng/ml; 29.5 <span>[1.5-120.75]</span> nmol/l) compared with controls (17.2 <span>[4.8-62.4]</span> ng/ml; 43 <span>[12-156]</span> nmol/l, p = 0.027). Univariate regression analysis showed that 25(OH)Vit D concentration was inversely related to triglycerides (r = -0.416, p = 0.003) and sdLDL-C (r = -0.305, p = 0.004). There was no association of 25(OH)Vit D with waist circumference, blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting glucose, Lp-PLA2 and hsCRP In multi-variate regression analysis the relationship between 25(OH)Vit D and sdLDL-C became insignificant when triglycerides were included in the model. 

Conclusions: Subjects with MetS exhibit lower 25(OH)Vit D serum levels compared with non-MetS individuals. Low 25(OH)Vit D is associated with higher sdLDL-C levels possibly through elevated triglycerides. No association between 25(OH)Vit D and Lp-PLA2 or hsCRP was found.

# Summary

MS 13 ng, non-MS 17 ng

Vitamin D level strongly associated with triglycerides, but not much else

Wonder what the results would have been if the non-MS had 30, 40, or even 50 nanograms of vitamin D
