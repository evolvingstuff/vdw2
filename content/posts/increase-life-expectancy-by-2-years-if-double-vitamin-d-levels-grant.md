#### An estimate of the global reduction in mortality rates through doubling vitamin D levels.

Eur J Clin Nutr. 2011 Jul 6. [doi: 10.1038/ejcn.2011.68.](https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2011.68.) 

Grant WB. Sunlight, Nutrition, and Health Research Center, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Background/Objectives:The goal of this work is to estimate the reduction in mortality rates for six geopolitical regions of the world under the assumption that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels increase from 54 to 110?nmol/l.

Subjects/Methods:This study is based on interpretation of the journal literature relating to the effects of solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) and vitamin D in reducing the risk of disease and estimates of the serum 25(OH)D level-disease risk relations for cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory infections. 

The vitamin D-sensitive diseases that account for more than  **half of global mortality rates**  are 

* <span style="color:#F00;">CVD,  </span>

* <span style="color:#F00;">cancer, </span>

* <span style="color:#F00;">respiratory infections, </span>

* <span style="color:#F00;">respiratory diseases, </span>

* <span style="color:#F00;">tuberculosis </span>and 

* <span style="color:#F00;">diabetes mellitus.</span>

Additional vitamin D-sensitive diseases and conditions that account for  **2 to 3% of global mortality rates**  are 

* Alzheimer's disease, 

* falls, 

* meningitis, 

* Parkinson's disease, 

* maternal sepsis, 

* maternal hypertension (pre-eclampsia) and 

* multiple sclerosis. 

Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels from 54 to 110?nmol/l would reduce the vitamin D-sensitive disease mortality rate by an estimated  **20%** .

Results:The reduction in all-cause mortality rates range from 

* 7.6% for African females to 

* 17.3% for European females. 

Reductions for males average 0.6% lower than for females. 

The estimated increase in life expectancy is 2 years for all six regions.

Conclusions:Increasing serum 25(OH)D levels is the  **most cost-effective way to reduce global mortality rates** , as the cost of vitamin D is very low and there are few adverse effects from oral intake and/or frequent moderate UVB irradiance with sufficient body surface area exposed.
