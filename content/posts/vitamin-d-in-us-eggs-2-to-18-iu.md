Nationwide sampling in the U.S. of whole large eggs, to update values in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) (http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata), was conducted in 2000–2001 and in 2010. Retail cartons of large eggs were obtained from 12 supermarket locations using statistical sampling plans based on market share and census data. Cholesterol was analyzed at three laboratories using standard methods involving gas chromatography of the saponified total lipid extract. Vitamin D3 and 25-OH-vitamin D3 (2010 samples only) were analyzed by HPLC and UHPLC–MS/MS. Quality control materials were included to validate the accuracy and precision of measurements. The mean cholesterol content decreased 51 mg/100 g (12%; p < 0.0001), from 423 mg/100 g in 2000–2001 to 372 (range 344–405) in 2010. Over the same period, average vitamin D3 increased by 60%, to 2.05 μg <span>[80 IU]</span>/100 g (range 0.97–12.1). Samples from 2010 contained 0.65 μg 25-OH-D3/100 g (range 0.43–1.32). The disparate vitamin D (and cholesterol) content of eggs sampled from different locations may reflect industry efforts to modify poultry feed or supplements to affect the nutrient profile of eggs. Cholesterol and vitamin D3 data from this work were included in SR release 23, and support food consumption surveys, food and nutrition policy, and consumer education.

Error bars indicate ±standard error. 

Within each figure the 2000/2001 and 2010 means differ significantly only for cholesterol (p < 0.0001).

### Summary by VitaminDWiki

Assuming a yoke weighs 18 grams

#### || | ugram/100 gram |IU/100 gram| IU/egg

Typical low|1|40|2 IU/egg

Typical high|8|320|18 IU/egg  ||

Wonder – Do New York chickens get more sunlight or more vitamin D in their feed?
