Asthma and allergic rhinitis are the most common chronic childhood diseases with an increasing prevalence worldwide. There is an urgent need to look for methods of preventing allergic diseases from an early age. The relationship between vitamin D status and allergic diseases has been discussed in several studies recently. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is suggested to affect the development and/or severity of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Observational studies have seemed to confirm that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to an increase in allergy and asthma. Following interventional studies, however, have yielded ambiguous results. In this review, we describe recent findings regarding 25(OH)D impact on allergic diseases and provide a systematic analysis of the causes of great variability of the achieved results in different studies.
