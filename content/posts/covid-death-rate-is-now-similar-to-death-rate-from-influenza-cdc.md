* "The number of deaths associated with COVID-19 continue to be perceived as considerably higher, given the attention to ongoing vaccination programs by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, TrialSiteâ€™s latest review of mortality rates and COVID-19 find that the number has now dipped well under 50,000,  **approaching about 40,000 for the year**  or as of current CDC statistics 1.4% of all deaths. The COVID-19 death rates are now in line with influenza which ranges from 12,000 to 51,000 per annum."
