July 13, 2010 (Honolulu, Hawaii) — Results of a new analysis using  data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III)  show that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for  cognitive impairment in older Americans.

The findings echo those from a second report from the same group in a  different cohort showing that low levels of vitamin D were associated  with subsequent cognitive decline during 6 years of follow-up.

Taken together, it appears that, "low levels of vitamin D are just  genuinely bad for the brain," lead author David J. Llewellyn, PhD, from  the University of Exeter Peninsula Medical School in the United Kingdom,  told Medscape Medical News. "That's why we're so excited,  because vitamin D supplements are such an obvious thing that we can do  something about now."

The expected epidemic of dementia with the aging population is  already starting to appear, he said, and although long-term strategies  are needed, trials that may have a short- to medium-term payoff are  urgently required immediately. In that setting, trials of vitamin D for  prevention may be a promising strategy, he said.

The results from NHANES III were presented here at the Alzheimer's  Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease 2010. The  results from the Invecchiare in Chianti  (InCHIANTI) study appear in the  July 12 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.

 **NHANES Findings** 

Vitamin D was once just of interest in bone health, but recent work  has suggested low vitamin D levels may be a risk factor for a wide range  of age-associated diseases, Dr. Llewellyn said, including cancer,  hypertension, stroke, and more recently, cognitive decline.

It is known that vitamin D crosses the blood–brain barrier and that  receptors for vitamin D are found across the brain, but its precise role  is still not known, Dr. Llewellyn noted. It does seem to play a role in  processes that may be important for dementia risk, including vascular  health and amyloid clearance from the brain. Given these associations,  he noted, it seems "biologically plausible" that there might be an  association of low vitamin D levels with dementia risk and cognitive  performance in the general population.

It is estimated that about a billion people worldwide have vitamin D  levels considered insufficient (&lt;75 nmol/L). Most of the world's  population living in the northern hemisphere does not have sufficient  exposure to the sun to produce enough vitamin D, there are few dietary  sources, and aging skin loses the ability over time to produce vitamin  D. "So it's an enormous public health concern, given its association  with an increasingly wide range of age-associated diseases," Dr.  Llewellyn said.

A previous paper using data from NHANES III did not find an  association between vitamin D levels and cognitive performance (McGrath  J, et al. Neuroepidemiol. 2007;29:49-54), but the researchers  speculated this may have related to methodology — specifically, the  choice of cognitive tests included.

The previous paper used only delayed verbal memory from the  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the East Boston Memory Test,  Dr. Llewellyn said. "I threw everything in, because I was interested in  whether this would be a more stable representation of these individuals'  cognitive status."

The researchers also adjusted for a wide range of variables,  including vitamin E levels, family income, more extensive measures of  physical activity, and obesity.

A total of 3325 adults aged 65 years or older had complete cognitive  assessments and blood samples available; cognitive impairment was  defined as the worst 10% of the distribution of combined scores. Vitamin  D levels were divided by cut points previously established for bone  health, from severely deficient (&lt;25 nmol/L) to sufficient (?75  nmol/L).

Compared with those patients with sufficient levels of vitamin D,  those participants who were very vitamin D deficient had a 6-fold higher  risk for cognitive impairment, with a doubling of risk still for those  who were considered deficient (?25 to &lt;50 nmol/L). The trend across  groups was statistically significant, suggesting a dose–response  relationship, he said.

"We see some attenuation in the fully adjusted model, but this is  still a relatively large effect size, I think it's fair to say," Dr.  Llewellyn noted. "People <span>[with severe vitamin D deficiency]</span> have about 4  times higher odds of cognitive impairment, and again the trend across  groups remains significant."

 **NHANES III: Risk for Cognitive Impairment  With Severe Vitamin D Deficiency vs Sufficient Levels** 

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Model**  |  **Hazard Ratio**  |  **95% Confidence Interval**  |  **Pfor Trend**  |
| Unadjusted model | 5.97 | 2.82 - 12.6 | &lt;.001 |
| Fully adjusted model | 3.94 | 1.49 - 10.43 | .017 |

When they restricted the analysis to only the memory items, there was  still a trend across groups, although it was no longer significant (P= .18), which may explain the previous null finding, Dr. Llewellyn  noted.

Further prospective data on this link are needed, he told the meeting  here, "and we also need to consider whether the enormous expense of a  trial is now justified."

At a press conference here, Dr. Llewellyn noted that they are now in  the early stages of designing the protocol for a vitamin D trial,  probably a dose-comparison trial, to see whether supplementation might  have an effect in preventing progression among those with early  cognitive impairment. Of course, "it will be funding-dependent," he  added wryly.

|  **Dr. William Thies**  |

William Thies, PhD, who moderated a press conference here featuring  this paper among others, pointed out that since 2 previous trials  treating cognitive impairment with vitamin D have been negative, "I  think prevention is the logical place to go, but typically you're  dealing with 5 to 10 times as many people and you're following them for a  much longer period of time, so the cost-escalation is often 10 to 20  times what it is for treatment."

 **InCHIANTI Findings** 

In a separate analysis published in the Archives of Internal  Medicine, Dr. Llewellyn and colleagues looked prospectively at the  relationship between vitamin D and cognitive decline in the InCHIANTI  study, a population-based study conducted in Italy between 1998 and  2006.

"To our knowledge," the researchers write, "no prospective study has  examined the association between vitamin D and cognitive decline or  dementia."

The InCHIANTI study included 858 adults aged 65 years or older who  completed interviews, cognitive assessments, and medical examinations,  as well as providing blood samples. Cognitively examination was done  using the MMSE, with substantial decline defined as 3 or more points.  Trail-Making Tests A and B were also used, with substantial decline  defined as the worst 10% of the distribution of decline or as  discontinued testing. Assessments were done at baseline and then at 3  and 6 years.

Again, the researchers found that those severely deficient in vitamin  D (&lt;25 nmol/L) had a higher risk for substantial decline on the MMSE  compared with those with sufficient levels (?75 nmol/L). Those who were  severely deficient also declined by an additional 0.3 MMSE points per  year more than those with sufficient levels.

Severe deficiency was also associated with the risk for substantial  decline on the Trail-Making Test B, but no significant association was  seen with the Trail-Making Test A.

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  **Test**  |  **Hazard Ratio**  |  **95% Confidence Interval**  |  **Pfor Trend**  |
| MMSE | 1.60 | 1.19 - 2.00 | .02 |
| Trail-Making Test A | 1.16 | 0.65 - 1.84 | .44 |
| Trail-Making Test B | 1.31 | 1.03 - 1.51 | .04 |

"If future prospective studies and randomized controlled trials  confirm that vitamin D deficiency is causally related to cognitive  decline, then this would open up important new possibilities for  treatment and prevention," Dr. Llewellyn and colleagues conclude.

 **Just a Marker of Poor Health?** 

In an editorial accompanying the Archives of Internal Medicinearticle, Andrew Grey, MD, and Mark Bolland, MBChB, PhD, from the  Department of Medicine at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, are  cautious in their assessment of the vitamin D link with cognitive  decline and other health problems.

Results from recent observational studies, they write, "have prompted  calls for widespread treatment of individuals with low levels of  vitamin D and the establishment of public health programs aimed at  raising the population levels of vitamin D to 'healthy' values."

Despite the preliminary evidence that components of vitamin D may  have a favorable effect in certain diseases, "it seems intuitively  unlikely that a single hormone could play a substantial role in  preventing or ameliorating the diverse range of diseases that have been  linked to low levels of vitamin D."

Instead, a more likely explanation is that low vitamin D is a marker  of overall poor health — low sunlight exposure, low physical activity,  high adiposity — not the cause of it, they speculate, a possibility  supported by the findings of this study as well.

 **We should therefore treat the data from  observational studies of vitamin D with caution.** 

Positive observational data have been proven wrong before after  randomized trials in settings such as postmenopausal hormone therapy,  they add. "We should therefore treat the data from observational studies  of vitamin D with caution."

"It is now time to test the various hypotheses generated by  observational studies of vitamin D, including that of Llewellyn et al,  in adequately designed and conducted randomized controlled trials," they  conclude. "Very importantly, such trials will also provide an  opportunity to systematically assess potential harms of vitamin D  supplementation, an issue that has been largely overlooked or dismissed.

"We should invest in trials that provide the best possible evidence  on the benefits and risks of vitamin D before we invest in costly,  difficult and potentially unrewarding interventional strategies."

NHANES III is funded by the Kaiser  Permanente Division of Research. The InCHIANTI study is supported in  part by the Italian Ministry of Health and by the United States National  Institute on Aging. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial  relationships.

Arch Intern Med. 2010;170(13):1135-1141. doi:10.1001/archinternmed.2010.173

Background  To our knowledge, no prospective study has examined the association between vitamin D and cognitive decline or dementia.

Methods  We determined whether low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) were associated with an increased risk of substantial cognitive decline in the InCHIANTI population–based study conducted in Italy between 1998 and 2006 with follow-up assessments every 3 years. A total of 858 adults 65 years or older completed interviews, cognitive assessments, and medical examinations and provided blood samples. Cognitive decline was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and substantial decline was defined as 3 or more points. The Trail-Making Tests A and B were also used, and substantial decline was defined as the worst 10% of the distribution of decline or as discontinued testing.

Results  The multivariate adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>) of substantial cognitive decline on the MMSE in participants who were severely serum 25(OH)D deficient (levels <25 nmol/L) in comparison with those with sufficient levels of 25(OH)D (?75 nmol/L) was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.19-2.00). Multivariate adjusted random-effects models demonstrated that the scores of participants who were severely 25(OH)D deficient declined by an additional 0.3 MMSE points per year more than those with sufficient levels of 25(OH)D. The relative risk for substantial decline on Trail-Making Test B was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.03-1.51) among those who were severely 25(OH)D deficient compared with those with sufficient levels of 25(OH)D. No significant association was observed for Trail-Making Test A.

Conclusion  Low levels of vitamin D were associated with substantial cognitive decline in the elderly population studied over a 6-year period, which raises important new possibilities for treatment and prevention.
