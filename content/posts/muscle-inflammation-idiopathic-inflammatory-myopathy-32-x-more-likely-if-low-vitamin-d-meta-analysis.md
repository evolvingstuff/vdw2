#### Vitamin D levels in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients: a meta-analysis

Review Postgrad Med . 2024 Feb 29. [doi: 10.1080/00325481.2024.2325335](https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2024.2325335)

Purpose: This meta-analysis aimed to explore correlations between vitamin D and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM).

Methods: A comprehensive database search was conducted on 13 October 2020. Mean differences (MDs) and aggregated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to determine the correlation between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and IIM. Statistical analysis was performed with RevMan 5.4 and Stata15, statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

Results: Search revealed  **five studies**  with 286 IIM patients and 480 healthy controls. Results with random-effects modeling indicated that serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in IIM patients than in healthy controls (MD = -13.10 ng/mL; 95% CI: -16.51 to -9.68; p < 0.00001). No differences were found between patients with IIM and other autoimmune diseases on vitamin D levels (MD =-2.65 ng/mL; 95% CI: -11.31-6.01; p = 0.55). In two studies with 185 IIM patients, those with low vitamin D levels exhibited higher creatine kinase levels (MD = 85.20 IU/L; 95% CI: 72.67-97.73; p < 0.00001) than those with normal vitamin D levels. VDD was correlated with an increased risk of IIM ( **RR = 3.24** , 95% CI: 1.81-5.79; p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed correlations between vitamin D level and IIM. The results indicated, VDD may be a risk factor for IIM, a determinant of immune dysregulation in IIM, or a consequence of IIM. Also, it implied further research to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for patients with IIM.
