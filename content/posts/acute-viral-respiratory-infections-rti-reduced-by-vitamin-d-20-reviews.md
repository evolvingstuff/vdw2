#### The effects of Vitamin D on acute viral respiratory infections: a rapid review - Aug 2020

 **Clinical significance:** 

Despite several positive systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the available experimental evidence related to the effects of vitamin D on acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is plagued with heterogeneity and mixed quality, and therefore is insufficient to recommend vitamin D supplementation to the general population as a protective agent against ARTI. However, based on the evidence identified in this rapid review (including a high margin of clinical safety), combined with strong mechanistic rationale, the following recommendations can be made for those at risk of ARTI: 

* 1. vitamin D status should be tested for those at risk of ARTI; 

* 2. patients identified with deficiency or insufficiency should be supplemented with vitamin D until their status is normalized; and 

* 3. daily dosing of vitamin D3 is preferred to achieve serum concentrations > 30 nmol/L in a timely manner. 

Clinical trials support vitamin D doses of 800 IU/day up to 10,000 lU/day with 1,000 - 2,000 lU/day being a common dosing strategy in clinical trials, and potentially more effective then lower daily or bolus dosing strategies.

* Sorry, unable to extract text from this PDF without lots of errors

   * Perhaps the watermark was too intense

* PDF is extremely conservative: the goal of >13 ng

   * Most health studies conclude that people need > 30ng, 

   * Some studies conclude that the goal should be [> 50 ng](/posts/is-50-ng-of-vitamin-d-too-high-just-right-or-not-enough)

* They incorrectly assume that the common dosing strategy is a good dosing strategy

* This study, like many previous studies, found that a single large (bolus) dose when not followed up with maintenance dosing, does not help.
