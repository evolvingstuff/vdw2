* Study made models which predicted which elderly women would needed Vitamin D supplementation in order to get to 30, 40, 50 and 60 nmol/L.

* Concluded that ALL older women needed supplementation, other than the summer, in order to stay above 20 ng (50 nmol)

* They also noticed that the seasonal variation is NOT sinusoidal 

   * (which many other studies have assumed)
