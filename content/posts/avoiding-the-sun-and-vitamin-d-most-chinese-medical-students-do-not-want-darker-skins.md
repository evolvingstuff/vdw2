Objective To investigate university students’ knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) regarding vitamin D.

Design The students were requested to answer a questionnaire related to vitamin D and sun exposure. The consumption frequency of foods rich in vitamin D was assessed. Additionally, the intake of vitamin D-containing supplements was recorded.

Setting A medical university in Nanjing, China.

Subjects  **Five hundred and fifteen medical students**  were included.

Results The highest rate of correct responses for the quiz was 68·0 %, while the lowest was 9·6 %.  **Most students lacked sun exposure because they did not want to get tanned** ; 82·7 % of students used some sun protection and sunscreen use was more popular in the female group. The consumption frequency of foods rich in vitamin D was low and  **5·6 % of the students used vitamin D supplements** . The students’ knowledge on vitamin D was derived mainly from the media and health professionals. Most of the students were interested to know more about vitamin D.

Conclusions The present study suggested that medical students had little knowledge and unfavourable behaviours. They should get more health education through the media and health professionals. It is advisable to increase their consumption of foods rich in vitamin D.
