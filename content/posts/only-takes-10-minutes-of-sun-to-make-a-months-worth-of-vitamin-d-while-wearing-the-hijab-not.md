### From [Hijabi Sisters, Vitamin D deficiency and weight loss.](http://www.muftisays.com/forums/14-peoples-say/9519-hijabi-sisters-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-weight-loss.html)

 **Exact quote** 

But it only takes 10 minutes of sun exposure to manufacture a month’s worth of vitamin D, and the Hijab can by no means block this benefit. It’s easy to get the necessary amount simply by taking a short walk at lunchtime with your Hijab or simply stand in the balcony, also with your Hijab, for 10 minutes.
