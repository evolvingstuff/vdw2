I cannot find a similar conclusion in any previous study

Seems possible, but I am unsure

Perhaps tremors are associated with the following

Jitteriness and tremors in the newborn period typically precipitate an extensive, invasive, and expensive search for the etiology. Vitamin D deficiency has not been historically included in the differential of tremors. We report a shivering, jittery newborn who was subjected to a battery of testing, with the only biochemical abnormality being vitamin D deficiency. A second case had chin tremors and vitamin D deficiency. Review of our patients suggests that shudders, shivers, jitteriness, or tremors may be the earliest sign of vitamin D deficiency in the newborn. Neonates who present with these signs should be investigated for vitamin D deficiency.
