Abstract

Humoral immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination are predominantly composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG3 subclass antibodies. As previously described in adults, S1-specific and receptor-binding domain–specific IgG4 levels increase significantly 1 year after the second BNT162b2 vaccination in children 5-11 years of age. Understanding mRNA vaccine–specific IgG4 responses in all age groups is crucial as more mRNA vaccines will reach licensure in the coming years.

#### IgG4 Antibodies Induced by Repeated Vaccination May Generate Immune Tolerance to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein – May 2023

Vaccines (Basel). 2023 May; 11(5): 991.  [doi: 10.3390/vaccines11050991](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050991)

Vladimir N. Uversky,1,* Elrashdy M. Redwan,2,3 William Makis,4 and Alberto Rubio-Casillas 5,6 

Less than a year after the global emergence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a novel vaccine platform based on mRNA technology was introduced to the market. Globally, around 13.38 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses of diverse platforms have been administered. To date, 72.3% of the total population has been injected at least once with a COVID-19 vaccine. As the immunity provided by these vaccines rapidly wanes, their ability to prevent hospitalization and severe disease in individuals with comorbidities has recently been questioned, and increasing evidence has shown that, as with many other vaccines, they do not produce sterilizing immunity, allowing people to suffer frequent re-infections. Additionally, recent investigations have found abnormally high levels of IgG4 in people who were administered two or more injections of the mRNA vaccines. HIV, Malaria, and Pertussis vaccines have also been reported to induce higher-than-normal IgG4 synthesis. 

Overall, there are three critical factors determining the class switch to IgG4 antibodies: 

1. excessive antigen concentration, 

1. repeated vaccination, and the 

1. type of vaccine used. 

It has been suggested that an increase in IgG4 levels could have a protecting role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to that occurring during successful allergen-specific immunotherapy by inhibiting IgE-induced effects. 

However, emerging evidence suggests that the reported increase in IgG4 levels detected after repeated vaccination with the mRNA vaccines may not be a protective mechanism; rather, it constitutes an immune tolerance mechanism to the spike protein that could promote unopposed SARS-CoV2 infection and replication by suppressing natural antiviral responses. Increased IgG4 synthesis due to repeated mRNA vaccination with high antigen concentrations may also cause autoimmune diseases, and promote cancer growth and autoimmune myocarditis in susceptible individuals.

#### What does a large increase in IgG4 mean about the long-term immune system response – Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024

A large increase in IgG4 levels can indicate an altered long-term immune system response, as seen in certain conditions like IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Key points about elevated IgG4 and the immune response include:

 **Polyclonal Expansion of IgG4 B Cells** 

Elevated IgG4 in IgG4-RD appears to result from a polyclonal expansion of many IgG4 B cells, irrespective of their antigen specificity. This polyclonal IgG4 response is seen against multiple non-infectious environmental antigens in IgG4-RD patients.

 **Repeated Antigen Exposure** 

IgG4 responses typically develop slowly over time after repeated or prolonged exposure to certain antigens, such as food antigens, parasites, and therapeutic proteins. The absence of infectious agents seems to be a common factor in many IgG4 responses.

 **Potential Protective Role** 

An increase in IgG4 levels could potentially have a protective role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to allergen immunotherapy. However, IgG4 antibodies induced by repeated vaccination have also been found to generate immune dysfunction in some cases.

 **Persistence of Elevated IgG4** 

In IgG4-RD, the disease may spontaneously disappear, persist, or flare from time to time. Persistently elevated IgG4, even after treatment, has been associated with a higher risk of disease relapse in some studies.

 **Blocking of Other Immune Responses** 

High levels of IgG4 have been found to block the cytotoxicity of other IgG subclasses in some infections like malaria. IgG4 can prevent the opsonization of infected cells by IgG1 and IgG3. In cancer, IgG4 may also block local immune responses and enable immune escape. In summary, a large increase in IgG4 reflects an altered long-term immune response characterized by polyclonal B cell expansion, repeated antigen exposure, potential blocking of other immune pathways, and variable persistence over time. The clinical implications depend on the underlying condition, encompassing both protective and dysfunctional roles of IgG4.

#### What are the potential consequences of elevated IgG4 levels on overall health - asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024

A large increase in IgG4 levels can have several potential consequences on overall health and the long-term immune response:

 **Polyclonal Expansion of IgG4 B Cells** 

Elevated IgG4 in IgG4 **-r** elated  **d** isease (IgG4- **RD** ) appears to result from a polyclonal expansion of many IgG4 B cells, irrespective of their antigen specificity. This polyclonal IgG4 response is seen against multiple non-infectious environmental antigens in IgG4-RD patients.

 **Association with Various Diseases** 

While IgG4-RD is a key condition associated with high IgG4, elevated IgG4 levels are also seen in other diseases like 

* infections, 

* autoimmune diseases, 

* cancers, 

* primary immune deficiencies, 

* interstitial lung diseases, 

* cystic fibrosis, and 

* vasculitis. 

However, IgG4 levels tend to be higher in IgG4-RD compared to these other conditions.

 **Blocking of Other Immune Responses** 

High levels of IgG4 have been found to block the cytotoxicity of other IgG subclasses in some infections like malaria. IgG4 can prevent the opsonization of infected cells by IgG1 and IgG3. In cancer, IgG4 may also block local immune responses and enable immune escape.

 **Potential Protective Role** 

Conversely, an increase in IgG4 levels could potentially have a protective role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to allergen immunotherapy. However, in the context of vaccination, IgG4-induced tolerance to viral antigens could inhibit the immune system from effectively detecting and attacking the pathogen.

 **Persistence and Relapse Risk** 

In IgG4-RD, persistently elevated IgG4, even after treatment, has been associated with a higher risk of disease relapse in some studies. The disease may spontaneously disappear, persist, or flare from time to time.In summary, while mildly elevated IgG4 may not always be pathological, a large increase reflects an altered long-term immune response characterized by polyclonal B cell expansion, repeated antigen exposure, potential blocking of other immune pathways, and variable persistence over time. The clinical implications depend on the underlying condition, encompassing both protective and dysfunctional roles of IgG4.

#### Can vitamin D supplementation affect IgG4 levels - I asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024 (YES!)

Based on the provided search results, there is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation may influence IgG4 levels:

 **Inverse Relationship Between Vitamin D and IgG4 Levels** 

One study found an inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and IgG4 levels in healthy older adults. Serum IgG4 levels peaked together with 25(OH)D levels during late summer, suggesting that higher vitamin D status is associated with lower IgG4 levels.

 **Potential Mechanisms** 

Vitamin D is thought to modulate immune responses by reducing the proliferation of immune cells, their maturation to plasma cells, and their production of immunoglobulins. Specific immune cells express the enzyme CYP27B1, which produces the active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) locally to regulate immune function.

 **Effects in Specific Conditions** 

In a study of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, vitamin D supplementation was found to affect IgG antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus, suggesting vitamin D can modulate humoral immune responses.In two case reports of patients with newly diagnosed neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), IgG-NMO titration turned negative after 15 weeks of high-dose vitamin D supplementation.

 **Limitations and Caveats** 

However, it&#39;s important to note some limitations:

* The inverse association between vitamin D and IgG4 was observed in  **healthy older adults** 

&gt; . It&#39;s unclear if the same relationship holds true in patients with elevated IgG4 related to specific diseases.

* While the studies suggest vitamin D may influence IgG4 levels, they do not definitively prove that vitamin D supplementation will necessarily lower pathologically elevated IgG4 in diseases like IgG4-related disease.

* Conditions associated with elevated IgG4 like IgG4-related disease are complex disorders with multiple contributing factors. Vitamin D status is likely only one piece of the puzzle.

In summary, while there is an intriguing inverse relationship between vitamin D and IgG4 levels in healthy populations, more clinical research is needed to determine if optimizing vitamin D levels through supplementation could be a useful adjunct strategy for managing conditions associated with elevated IgG4. Vitamin D should not be considered a standalone treatment for lowering IgG4 at this time.

Abstract
Humoral immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination are predominantly composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG3 subclass antibodies. As previously described in adults, S1-specific and receptor-binding domain–specific IgG4 levels increase significantly 1 year after the second BNT162b2 vaccination in children 5-11 years of age. Understanding mRNA vaccine–specific IgG4 responses in all age groups is crucial as more mRNA vaccines will reach licensure in the coming years.

!!!!IgG4 Antibodies Induced by Repeated Vaccination May Generate Immune Tolerance to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein – May 2023
Vaccines (Basel). 2023 May; 11(5): 991.  doi: 10.3390/vaccines11050991
Vladimir N. Uversky,1,* Elrashdy M. Redwan,2,3 William Makis,4 and Alberto Rubio-Casillas 5,6 

Less than a year after the global emergence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a novel vaccine platform based on mRNA technology was introduced to the market. Globally, around 13.38 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses of diverse platforms have been administered. To date, 72.3% of the total population has been injected at least once with a COVID-19 vaccine. As the immunity provided by these vaccines rapidly wanes, their ability to prevent hospitalization and severe disease in individuals with comorbidities has recently been questioned, and increasing evidence has shown that, as with many other vaccines, they do not produce sterilizing immunity, allowing people to suffer frequent re-infections. Additionally, recent investigations have found abnormally high levels of IgG4 in people who were administered two or more injections of the mRNA vaccines. HIV, Malaria, and Pertussis vaccines have also been reported to induce higher-than-normal IgG4 synthesis. 
Overall, there are three critical factors determining the class switch to IgG4 antibodies: 
#excessive antigen concentration, 
#repeated vaccination, and the 
#type of vaccine used. 
It has been suggested that an increase in IgG4 levels could have a protecting role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to that occurring during successful allergen-specific immunotherapy by inhibiting IgE-induced effects. 
However, emerging evidence suggests that the reported increase in IgG4 levels detected after repeated vaccination with the mRNA vaccines may not be a protective mechanism; rather, it constitutes an immune tolerance mechanism to the spike protein that could promote unopposed SARS-CoV2 infection and replication by suppressing natural antiviral responses. Increased IgG4 synthesis due to repeated mRNA vaccination with high antigen concentrations may also cause autoimmune diseases, and promote cancer growth and autoimmune myocarditis in susceptible individuals.

!!!!What does a large increase in IgG4 mean about the long-term immune system response – Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024
A large increase in IgG4 levels can indicate an altered long-term immune system response, as seen in certain conditions like IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Key points about elevated IgG4 and the immune response include:

__Polyclonal Expansion of IgG4 B Cells__
Elevated IgG4 in IgG4-RD appears to result from a polyclonal expansion of many IgG4 B cells, irrespective of their antigen specificity. This polyclonal IgG4 response is seen against multiple non-infectious environmental antigens in IgG4-RD patients.

__Repeated Antigen Exposure__
IgG4 responses typically develop slowly over time after repeated or prolonged exposure to certain antigens, such as food antigens, parasites, and therapeutic proteins. The absence of infectious agents seems to be a common factor in many IgG4 responses.

__Potential Protective Role__
An increase in IgG4 levels could potentially have a protective role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to allergen immunotherapy. However, IgG4 antibodies induced by repeated vaccination have also been found to generate immune dysfunction in some cases.

__Persistence of Elevated IgG4__
In IgG4-RD, the disease may spontaneously disappear, persist, or flare from time to time. Persistently elevated IgG4, even after treatment, has been associated with a higher risk of disease relapse in some studies.

__Blocking of Other Immune Responses__
High levels of IgG4 have been found to block the cytotoxicity of other IgG subclasses in some infections like malaria. IgG4 can prevent the opsonization of infected cells by IgG1 and IgG3. In cancer, IgG4 may also block local immune responses and enable immune escape. In summary, a large increase in IgG4 reflects an altered long-term immune response characterized by polyclonal B cell expansion, repeated antigen exposure, potential blocking of other immune pathways, and variable persistence over time. The clinical implications depend on the underlying condition, encompassing both protective and dysfunctional roles of IgG4.

!!!!What are the potential consequences of elevated IgG4 levels on overall health - asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024
A large increase in IgG4 levels can have several potential consequences on overall health and the long-term immune response:

__Polyclonal Expansion of IgG4 B Cells__
Elevated IgG4 in IgG4__-r__elated __d__isease (IgG4-__RD__) appears to result from a polyclonal expansion of many IgG4 B cells, irrespective of their antigen specificity. This polyclonal IgG4 response is seen against multiple non-infectious environmental antigens in IgG4-RD patients.

__Association with Various Diseases__
While IgG4-RD is a key condition associated with high IgG4, elevated IgG4 levels are also seen in other diseases like 
*infections, 
*autoimmune diseases, 
*cancers, 
*primary immune deficiencies, 
*interstitial lung diseases, 
*cystic fibrosis, and 
*vasculitis. 
However, IgG4 levels tend to be higher in IgG4-RD compared to these other conditions.

__Blocking of Other Immune Responses__
High levels of IgG4 have been found to block the cytotoxicity of other IgG subclasses in some infections like malaria. IgG4 can prevent the opsonization of infected cells by IgG1 and IgG3. In cancer, IgG4 may also block local immune responses and enable immune escape.

__Potential Protective Role__
Conversely, an increase in IgG4 levels could potentially have a protective role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to allergen immunotherapy. However, in the context of vaccination, IgG4-induced tolerance to viral antigens could inhibit the immune system from effectively detecting and attacking the pathogen.

__Persistence and Relapse Risk__
In IgG4-RD, persistently elevated IgG4, even after treatment, has been associated with a higher risk of disease relapse in some studies. The disease may spontaneously disappear, persist, or flare from time to time.In summary, while mildly elevated IgG4 may not always be pathological, a large increase reflects an altered long-term immune response characterized by polyclonal B cell expansion, repeated antigen exposure, potential blocking of other immune pathways, and variable persistence over time. The clinical implications depend on the underlying condition, encompassing both protective and dysfunctional roles of IgG4.

!!!!Can vitamin D supplementation affect IgG4 levels - I asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024 (YES!)
Based on the provided search results, there is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation may influence IgG4 levels:

__Inverse Relationship Between Vitamin D and IgG4 Levels__
One study found an inverse relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and IgG4 levels in healthy older adults. Serum IgG4 levels peaked together with 25(OH)D levels during late summer, suggesting that higher vitamin D status is associated with lower IgG4 levels.

__Potential Mechanisms__
Vitamin D is thought to modulate immune responses by reducing the proliferation of immune cells, their maturation to plasma cells, and their production of immunoglobulins. Specific immune cells express the enzyme CYP27B1, which produces the active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) locally to regulate immune function.

__Effects in Specific Conditions__
In a study of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, vitamin D supplementation was found to affect IgG antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus, suggesting vitamin D can modulate humoral immune responses.In two case reports of patients with newly diagnosed neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), IgG-NMO titration turned negative after 15 weeks of high-dose vitamin D supplementation.

__Limitations and Caveats__
However, it&#39;s important to note some limitations:
*The inverse association between vitamin D and IgG4 was observed in __healthy older adults__
+. It&#39;s unclear if the same relationship holds true in patients with elevated IgG4 related to specific diseases.
*While the studies suggest vitamin D may influence IgG4 levels, they do not definitively prove that vitamin D supplementation will necessarily lower pathologically elevated IgG4 in diseases like IgG4-related disease.
*Conditions associated with elevated IgG4 like IgG4-related disease are complex disorders with multiple contributing factors. Vitamin D status is likely only one piece of the puzzle.
In summary, while there is an intriguing inverse relationship between vitamin D and IgG4 levels in healthy populations, more clinical research is needed to determine if optimizing vitamin D levels through supplementation could be a useful adjunct strategy for managing conditions associated with elevated IgG4. Vitamin D should not be considered a standalone treatment for lowering IgG4 at this time.
