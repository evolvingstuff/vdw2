Using survey data from respondents associated with  **three medical practices in the US** , vaccinated children were compared to unvaccinated children for the incidence of severe allergies, autism, gastrointestinal disorders, asthma, ADHD, and chronic ear infections. All diagnoses were based on parental reporting with chart review for confirmation of diagnoses. Cases were stratified with non-cases based on year of birth and sex, and compared using a logistic regression model which also accounted for breastfeeding status and type of birth (vaginal versus cesarean section). 

Vaccinated children were significantly more likely than unvaccinated children to be diagnosed with 

* severe allergies (OR = 4.31, 95% CI 1.67 - 11.1),

* autism (OR = 5.03, 95% CI 1.64 - 15.5), 

* gastrointestinal disorders (OR = 13.8, 95% CI 5.85 - 32.5), 

* asthma (OR = 17.6, 95% CI 6.94 - 44.4), 

* ADHD (OR = 20.8, 95% CI 4.74 - 91.2), and 

* chronic ear infections (OR = 27.8, 95% CI 9.56 - 80.8). 

Vaccinated children were less likely to be diagnosed with chickenpox (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.029 - 0.36). 

Children who were "vaccinated and not breastfed" or "vaccinated and delivered via cesarean section" had the highest rates of adverse health outcomes. 

In this study, higher ORs were observed within the vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups for several adverse health conditions. Further research is essential to understand the full scope of health effects associated with childhood vaccination.

Using survey data from respondents associated with __three medical practices in the US__, vaccinated children were compared to unvaccinated children for the incidence of severe allergies, autism, gastrointestinal disorders, asthma, ADHD, and chronic ear infections. All diagnoses were based on parental reporting with chart review for confirmation of diagnoses. Cases were stratified with non-cases based on year of birth and sex, and compared using a logistic regression model which also accounted for breastfeeding status and type of birth (vaginal versus cesarean section). 

Vaccinated children were significantly more likely than unvaccinated children to be diagnosed with 
*severe allergies (OR = 4.31, 95% CI 1.67 - 11.1),
*autism (OR = 5.03, 95% CI 1.64 - 15.5), 
*gastrointestinal disorders (OR = 13.8, 95% CI 5.85 - 32.5), 
*asthma (OR = 17.6, 95% CI 6.94 - 44.4), 
*ADHD (OR = 20.8, 95% CI 4.74 - 91.2), and 
*chronic ear infections (OR = 27.8, 95% CI 9.56 - 80.8). 
Vaccinated children were less likely to be diagnosed with chickenpox (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.029 - 0.36). 

Children who were &quot;vaccinated and not breastfed&quot; or &quot;vaccinated and delivered via cesarean section&quot; had the highest rates of adverse health outcomes. 
In this study, higher ORs were observed within the vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups for several adverse health conditions. Further research is essential to understand the full scope of health effects associated with childhood vaccination.
