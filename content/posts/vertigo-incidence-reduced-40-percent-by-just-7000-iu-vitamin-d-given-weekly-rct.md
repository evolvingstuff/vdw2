Objective

To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the recurrence rate of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).

Methods

A single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted between November 2018 and May 2020. After successful treatment with canalith repositioning maneuvers, patients diagnosed with BPPV were randomized to either the vitamin D (n = 20) or placebo (n = 18) group. Only patients with serum vitamin D levels <20 ng mL−1 were included. The vitamin D group received 7000 IU of vitamin D weekly for a year, while the placebo group received a matching placebo drug. The final endpoint was the BPPV recurrence rate and correlation with serum vitamin D levels after 6 and 12 months in both groups.

Results

Among 38 patients, 37 were followed up for 6 months and 30 for 12 months. Significantly higher serum vitamin D levels were observed in the vitamin D group compared to the placebo group at both the 6-month and 1-year follow-ups (p < .001 at each timepoint). The recurrence rate was lower in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group after 6 months (p = .008) and 1 year (p = .003).

Conclusion

Vitamin D supplementation, in the absence of calcium, may be beneficial for patients prone to recurrent BPPV episodes, particularly when serum vitamin D levels are suboptimal (PRE20181024-001, Clinical Research Information Service, South Korea).
