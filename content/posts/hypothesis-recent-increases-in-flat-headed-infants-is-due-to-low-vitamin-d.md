## Hypothesis Low vitamin D ==> low bone and muscle strength ==> flat head

## News item: [Study published in Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/07/02/peds.2012-3438.abstract?sid=aad75b0e-0683-4720-a1d9-c49fe72c11c7%20)

## Low Vitamin is associated with each of the following items

1. More frequent flat heads with preemies 

1. More frequent flat heads with twins 

1. More frequent flat heads with infants with dark skins 

1. More frequent flat heads with infants with weak necks (muscles)

## If vitamin D is indeed a factor, there will be an increased frequency with

1. Latitude or countries with low vitamin D

1. Spring births

1. Urban births

1. Closely spaced births

1. Infants who are breastfed (without vitamin D supplements)

Due to SIDS awareness through the Back to Sleep Campaign, the number of SIDS cases has decreased, but there has been a dramatic increase in the number of infants with positional plagiocephaly.’’
