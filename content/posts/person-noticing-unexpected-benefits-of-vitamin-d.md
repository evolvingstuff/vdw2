## [CROSE1967's Blog](http://www.sparkpeople.com/mypage_public_journal_individual.asp?blog_id=4621117) on Sparkpeople Dieting Dec 11, 2011

It's been 5 weeks since I've been diagnosed with severe vitamin D deficiency. 

I'll be taking 50,000 units once a week for a year. I'm starting to notice subtle changes.

* My hair isn't falling out anymore. Now when I comb my hair there is very little hair in the comb. I had no idea this was a side effect of a vitamin D deficiency until I did some research. 

* I have more energy. I don't require nearly as much sleep as I needed in the past. It's so much easier for me to wake up in the morning too. I used to hit my alarm for 2 hours in the morning before waking up and getting out of bed. Now I hit it for 15 minutes and jump right out of bed.

* I'm starting to feeling like the new "old me."

* I'm also starting to realize I've been sick for quite a while. 

* My foot also stopped hurting. 

* My nails have become stronger. 

* My hair is starting to grow again. 

* The biggest surprise to date is I've got the feeling of being "satisfied/full" during and after eating.

I'm just realizing that I've lost that feeling for quite some time now. The first time I realized it was after I ate a meal I stepped back, looked at my stomach and said "what is that feeling?" I then realized that's the feeling of food satisfaction. A feeling I can't remember when I had felt it last. My weight gain is due to not having that feeling. After doing some research, I've found that when you have this deficiency your brain doesn't tell your stomach that you're full so you continue to eat & eat searching for that "full" feeling that never comes. Needless to say I've definitely lost weight & inches but for now I'm going to focus on rediscovering my body, which is on its way to recovery. I will update my blog periodically on this journey. This is going to be an interesting journey. I'm looking forward to this rediscovery process and journey.
