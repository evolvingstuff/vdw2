#### Influence of Vitamin D supplementation on reproductive outcomes of infertile patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology volume 21 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12958-023-01068-8

Background

Low vitamin D status has been associated with an increased risk for infertility. Recent evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in improving reproductive outcomes is inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation could improve the reproductive outcomes of infertile patients and evaluate how the parameters of vitamin D supplementation affected the clinical pregnancy rate.

Methods

We searched seven electronic databases (CNKI, Cqvip, Wanfang, PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library) up to March 2022. Randomized and cohort studies were collected to assess the reproductive outcomes difference between the intervention (vitamin D) vs. the control (placebo or none). Mantel-Haenszel random effects models were used. Effects were reported as odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI). PROSPERO database registration number: CRD42022304018.

Results

Twelve eligible studies (n = 2352) were included: 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs, n = 1677) and 3 cohort studies (n = 675). Pooled results indicated that infertile women treated with vitamin D had a significantly  **increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with the control group (OR: 1.70** , 95% CI: 1.24–2.34; I2 = 63%, P = 0.001). However, the implantation, biochemical pregnancy, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates had no significant difference (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.00–3.47; I2 = 85%, P = 0.05; OR: 1.49; 0.98–2.26; I2 = 63%, P = 0.06; OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.63–1.53; I2 = 0%, P = 0.94 and OR: 3.64, 95% CI: 0.58–11.98; I2 = 68%, P = 0.21). The improvement of clinical pregnancy rate in the intervention group was influenced by the vitamin D level of patients, drug type, the total vitamin D dosage, the duration, administration frequency, and daily dosage of vitamin D supplementation. The infertile women (vitamin D level < 30 ng/mL) treated with the multicomponent drugs including vitamin D (10,000–50,000 IU or 50,000–500,000 IU), or got vitamin D 1000–10,000 IU daily, lasting for 30–60 days could achieve better pregnancy outcome.

Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis systematically investigated that moderate daily dosing of vitamin D supplementation could improve the clinical pregnancy rate of infertile women and reported the effects of vitamin D supplementation parameters on pregnancy outcomes. A larger sample size and high-quality RCTs are necessary to optimize the parameters of vitamin D supplementation to help more infertile patients benefit from this therapy.

#### 1.7X better on-average when taking any amount of vitamin D - more is better

---

#### Greatly helps if  the male takes vitamin D as well

---

#### If not using a loading dose, will take 2-6 months to benefit from the Vitamin D
