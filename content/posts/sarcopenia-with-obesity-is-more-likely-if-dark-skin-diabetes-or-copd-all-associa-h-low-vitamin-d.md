 **What is Known About the Topic** 

* Individuals are living longer than ever before and in the United States the older adult population is becoming more ethnically and racially diverse.

* There can be genetic variability in body mass index and body composition.

* Sarcopenia and obesity contribute to poor health outcomes and when occurring together as sarcopenic obesity, can cause even further health complications that limit the human condition and functionality.

* Few studies have specifically considered these conditions across different racial/ethnic populations and with advancing age.

 **What this Paper Adds About the Topic** 

* This study documented that the prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity increased with age and differed by sex and racial/ethnic group.

* The study further demonstrated a close association of sarcopenia and obesity, particularly for older adults.

* Hispanics were found to have the highest prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity and Non-Hispanic Blacks had the lowest. Within Non-Hispanic Blacks, there was a greater discrepancy between sex, with males having a higher prevalence of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity compared to females.

* With the new recognition of sarcopenia as a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportable condition and assignment of an ICD-10 CM code for the sarcopenia, this research underscores the importance of identifying and intervening for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, especially among racial/ethnic groups who may be at higher risk.

Sarcopenia is the natural age-associated loss of muscle mass/function, often occurring simultaneously with obesity, especially in older adults. Sarcopenia and obesity contribute to poor health outcomes and when occurring together as sarcopenic obesity (SO) can cause further health complications. Few studies have specifically considered these conditions across different racial/ethnic populations. This study examined the prevalence of sarcopenia and SO among U.S. adults by different age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups, using 1999-2004 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and its racial/ethnic subpopulation groupings. Sarcopenia was defined as low appendicular lean mass (adjusted for Body Mass Index (BMI) of <0.789 kg/ m2 for males, <0.512 kg/m2 for females) and self-reported functional limitation. Obesity was defined as BMI >30 kg/m2 with SO defined as those meeting criteria for both sarcopenia and obesity. The analysis included 4367 adult subjects; for each race/ethnic subpopulation, sarcopenia prevalence increased with age. Sarcopenia prevalence varied by sex and race/ ethnic subpopulation: Hispanic (26.8% male, 27.2% female); Non-Hispanic (NH) White (15.5% male, 15.1% female); NH Black (8.6% male, 1.6% female); and Other (16.5% male, 23.2% female). Sarcopenic obesity also increased with age and varied by sex and race/ethnic subpopulation: Hispanic (8.57% male, 8.87% female); NH White (6.48% male, 8.06% female); NH Black (3.95% male, 1.12% female); and Other (4.46% male, 0.0% female). Increased awareness of variability in sarcopenia/SO may help develop effective screenings/ care management and interventions/public health policies to maintain functionality and reduce health disparities among an increasingly diverse U.S. older adult popu
