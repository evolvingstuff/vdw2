This narrative review reveals the sources of discrepancy. The following databases were searched for the terms “xylitol” or “artificial sweeteners” restricted to the English language: PubMed, Web of Science, Evidenced-Based Medicine, Scopus, and the Cochrane database. In a separate search, the terms “dental caries” or “cariogenicity” or “glucosyltransferase” or “low glycemic” or “low insulinemic” or “dysbiosis” or “gut microbiome” were used and then combined. In section I, findings regarding the role of xylitol in dental caries prevention, the appropriateness of research methods, and the causes for potential biases are summarized. In section II, the systemic effects of xylitol on gut microbiota as well as low-glycemic/insulinogenic systemic effects are evaluated and summarized. The substitution of a carbonyl group with an alcohol radical in xylitol hinders its absorption and slowly releases sugar into the bloodstream. This quality of xylitol is beneficial for diabetic patients to maintain a constant glucose level. Although this quality of xylitol has been proven in in vitro and animal studies, it has yet to be proven in humans. Paradoxically, recent animal studies reported hyperglycemia and intestinal dysbiosis with artificial sweetener consumption. Upon careful inspection of evidence, it was revealed that these reports may be due to misinterpretation of original references or flaws in study methodology. Any systemic benefits of xylitol intake must be weighed in consideration with the well-established adverse gastrointestinal consequences. The contribution of xylitol to gut dysbiosis that may affect systemic immunity warrants further research.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/oral-and-systemic-effects-of-xylitol.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=xylitol-chewing-gums-reduced-risk-of-dental-caries-by-37x---dec-1995>Xylitol Chewing Gums reduced risk of dental caries by 3.7X - Dec 1995</h4><p><strong>Xylitol Chewing Gums and Caries Rates: A 40-month Cohort Study</strong></p><p>J of Dental Research Volume 74, Issue 12 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/00220345950740121501>https://doi.org/10.1177/00220345950740121501</a></p><p>K.K. Makinen, C.A. Bennett, &mldr;</p><p>Dental caries is a pandemic infectious disease which can affect the quality of life and consumes considerable health care resources. The chewing of xylitol, sorbitol, and even sugar gum has been suggested to reduce caries rates. No clinical study has simultaneously investigated the effectiveness of these gums when compared with a group receiving no chewing gum.</p><p>A 40-month double-blind cohort study on the relationship between the use of chewing gum and dental caries was performed in 1989-1993 in Belize, Central America. One thousand two hundred and seventy-seven subjects (mean age, 10.2 years) were assigned to nine treatment groups: one control group (no supervised gum use), four xylitol groups (range of supervised xylitol consumption: 4.3 to 9.0 g/day),</p><ul><li><p>two xylitol-sorbitol groups (range of supervised consumption of total polyols: 8.0 to 9.7 g/day),</p></li><li><p>one sorbitol group (supervised consumption: 9.0 g/day), and</p></li><li><p>one sucrose group (9.0 g/day).</p></li></ul><p>The gum use during school hours was supervised. Four calibrated dentists performed the caries registrations by means of a modified WHO procedure. The primary endpoint was the development of an unequivocal caries lesion on a non-cavitated tooth surface.</p><p>Compared with the no-gum group,</p><ul><li><p>sucrose gum usage resulted in a marginal increase in the caries rate (relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.49; p = 0.1128).</p></li><li><p>Sorbitol gum significantly reduced caries rates (relative risk, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.92; p = 0.0074).</p></li></ul><p>The four xylitol gums were most effective in reducing caries rates, the most effective agent being a</p><ul><li>100% xylitol pellet gum (relative risk, <strong>0.27</strong> ; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.36; p = 0.0001).</li></ul><p>This gum was superior to any other gum (p &lt; 0.01). The xylitol-sorbitol mixtures were less effective than xylitol, but they still reduced caries rates significantly compared with the no-gum group. DMFS analyses were consistent with these conclusions. The results suggest that systematic usage of polyol-based chewing gums reduces caries rates in young subjects, with xylitol gums being more effective than sorbitol gums.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/xylitol-chewing-gums-and-caries-rates-a-40-month-cohort-study-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=health-benefits-of-xylitol---july-2020>Health benefits of xylitol - July 2020</h4><p>Applied Microbiology and BiotechnologyVolume 104, pages 7225–7237, (2020)</p><p>Asma Gasmi Benahmed, Amin Gasmi, Maria Arshad, Mariia Shanaida, Roman Lysiuk, Massimiliano Peana, Irena Pshyk-Titko, Stepan Adamiv, Yurii Shanaida & Geir Bjørklund</p><p><strong>Table of Content</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/toc-xylitol.png alt=image width=450>

Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials published between 1971 and 2020 conducted in healthy subjects were included in the review.</p><p>Results</p><p>The initial search identified 424 xylitol articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, altogether 14 articles (16 studies) were reviewed. The review identified 12 of the total of 14 xylitol chewing gum studies as having fair or high quality. In 13 of the 14 chewing gum studies, xylitol gum decreased plaque accumulation. In six studies, xylitol gum chewing decreased plaque compared to sorbitol gum, and in three studies compared to gum base/no gum. In three fair-quality studies conducted with xylitol candies, plaque accumulation did not change.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Habitual xylitol gum chewing appears to show plaque-reducing effects that differ from those of sorbitol gum. This suggests specific effects for xylitol on plaque accumulation. Xylitol candies appear not to decrease plaque. The heterogeneity of the studies warrants further research.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/xylitol-systematic-review.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=some-of-100s-of-xylitol-videos>Some of 100&rsquo;s of Xylitol videos</h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;ab_channel=Dr.ElliePhillips">How To Reverse a Cavity at Home | Cure Tooth Decay</a> Dec 2023</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;t=0s">00:00</a> Introduction</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;t=32s">00:32</a> What forms a cavity?</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;t=88s">01:28</a> beginning of a cavity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;t=261s">04:21</a> Progression of a cavity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;t=419s">06:59</a> How to stop a cavity when it starts</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlRM-YgRQ8&amp;t=728s">2:08</a> Reverse a cavity if it has progressed farther</p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0GoCGR0Uas&amp;ab_channel=JREClips">Rhonda Patrick Raves About the Benefits of Xylitol Gum</a> 6 minutes - 2020</p><ul><li>Comment by a viewer:&rdquo; Xylitol-gum was invented in Finland in the 70&rsquo;s, after discovering that it prevents cavities.
