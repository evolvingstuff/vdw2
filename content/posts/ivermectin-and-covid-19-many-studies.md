#### Summary of this page by [Perplexity AI, April 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-summarize-the-attached-zxSY0MQHRFOG.HVm._n7Dg)

The attached document provides an extensive overview of ivermectin's use in the context of COVID-19, including studies, clinical trials, and political controversies. Below is a summarized breakdown of the key sections:

 **Key Findings on Ivermectin's Effectiveness** 

*  **Clinical Studies** : Multiple studies demonstrate ivermectin's potential in reducing COVID-19 infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality. For instance:

* In India, ivermectin reduced deaths by 14 times during widespread use; mortality increased after its discontinuation.

* A study in Brazil showed a dose-response effect, with regular ivermectin users experiencing a 92% reduction in mortality compared to non-users.

* Randomized trials in Israel suggested ivermectin reduced viral load and shortened isolation times by improving viral clearance.

 **Mechanisms of Action** : Ivermectin works through various pathways, including inhibiting viral replication, reducing inflammation during cytokine storms, and clearing spike proteins to prevent micro-clotting in the lungs.

 **Comparison with Other Treatments** 

*  **Ivermectin vs. Paxlovid** : The document highlights stark differences:

* Cost: Ivermectin is significantly cheaper ("pennies" vs. $530 for Paxlovid).

* Safety: Ivermectin shows fewer drug interactions and no organ damage compared to Paxlovid.

* Efficacy: Studies suggest ivermectin reduces mortality rates more effectively.

 **Vitamin D Interaction - (raises Vitamin D levels))

* Ivermectin raises vitamin D levels by decreasing CYP3A4 enzyme activity. 

> Both ivermectin and vitamin D have been studied for their roles in COVID-19 prevention and treatment.** Political Controversies *** The document discusses the politicization of ivermectin:

* Suppression of its use despite evidence of efficacy.

* Regulatory hurdles and conflicts of interest surrounding approval processes.

* Comparisons are made between countries that allow prophylactic use (e.g., African nations) and those that restrict it.** Global Usage *** Countries like Australia have shifted policies over time, banning and later allowing ivermectin for general health use.

* Mass drug administration programs in Africa show significantly 

> lower COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates compared to non-endemic countries.** Criticism and Challenges *** Some studies reported negative outcomes or inconclusive results due to low doses or late administration.

* The document critiques rigid adherence to statistical thresholds for evaluating life-saving treatments during pandemics.** Additional Applications *** Beyond COVID-19, ivermectin has been used successfully for conditions 

> like scabies and river blindness, earning it a Nobel Prize for safety and efficacy.

This summary captures the breadth of information provided in the document regarding ivermectin's role in COVID-19 treatment and prevention, alongside its broader implications in medicine.** Citations: **{FONT(size="17")}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ivermectin-and-covid-19---many-studies-april-2025.pdf">Download the PDF of this page</a> **{FONT}

#### Interview concerning Ivermectin: Dr. Campbell - April 2025** [YouTube 65 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m-HM2hmVSM) **** The video features Professor Colleen Aldis from the University of Kwazulu Natal, South Africa, discussing her recent paper on ivermectin use for COVID-19, specifically for patients with hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels).  
Key points discussed include: **1. The research applied**  Bradford Hill criteria **(established in 1965) to evaluate causality between ivermectin treatment and improved oxygen levels in COVID-19 patients.

1. Prof. Aldis became interested in ivermectin in late 2020 when South African pharmaceutical agencies warned against its use despite its established safety profile.

1. Three clinical studies were analyzed: Dr. Jackie Stone (Zimbabwe), Dr. Sabine Hazan (US), and Dr. Babalola (Nigeria), all showing rapid improvement in oxygen saturation after ivermectin treatment compared to control groups.

1. The highest doses of ivermectin (used by Stone and Hazan) showed the most dramatic improvement, demonstrating a dose-response relationship.

1. Mechanistic evidence shows ivermectin works through multiple pathways: 

> inhibiting viral replication (as a zinc ionophore),  (note: [Zinc fighting COVID - 39 studies](/tags/zinc-fighting-covid-39-studies.html)) 

> reducing inflammation during cytokine storms, and most critically, 

> removing spike proteins from red blood cells to prevent micro-clotting in the lungs.

1. Timing matters: early treatment with lower doses prevents disease progression, while higher doses are needed later to address thrombosis (clotting) when patients are already hypoxic.

1. The research demonstrates "coherence" - consistency between laboratory findings, clinical observations, and community-level outcomes - supporting ivermectin's effectiveness.

1. Studies showing negative results typically used short treatment regimens (3 days), low doses, late administration after symptom onset, or involved low-risk patients who wouldn't have been hospitalized anyway.

1. The researchers criticize rigid adherence to p-value thresholds (0.05) for determining efficacy, arguing that for pandemic treatments, a higher threshold (0.2) may be appropriate when considering life-saving interventions.

1. For future pandemics, they propose prioritizing treatments that are: cheap, readily available, safe, have plausible mechanisms of action, and are backed by evidence, even before randomized controlled trials are completed.

#### Why It's Important Everyone Should Have Ivermectin Handy - Nov 2024** [Substack](https://substack.com/home/post/p-140345971%20) **includes:

* "The med has won a Nobel Prize for its safety and efficacy."

* US: 1 year of Ivermectin - zero deaths, 1 year of Tylenol 164 deaths

* Ivermectin will be protective for 3.5 days.

* "Early Treatment (if infected with anything, bacterial, viral, whatever) - 0.4 mg/kg daily. Continue use up to a few days after symptoms subside. Symptoms might subside in just a few hours."

#### Ivermectin substantially reduced COVID infection, hospitalization, death (India)- Sept 2022** Regular Use of Ivermectin as Prophylaxis for COVID-19 Led Up to a 92% Reduction in COVID- 19 Mortality Rate in a Dose-Response Manner: Results of a Prospective Observational Study of a Strictly Controlled Population of 88,012 Subjects **Cureus 14(8): e28624. DOI 10.7759/cureus.28624

Background

We have previously demonstrated that ivermectin used as prophylaxis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), irrespective of the regularity, in a strictly controlled citywide program in Southern Brazil (Itajai, Brazil), was associated with reductions in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality rates. In this study, our objective was to determine if the regular use of ivermectin impacted the level of protection from COVID- 19 and related outcomes, reinforcing the efficacy of ivermectin through the demonstration of a dose- response effect.

Methods

This exploratory analysis of a prospective observational study involved a program that used ivermectin at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day for two consecutive days, every 15 days, for 150 days. Regularity definitions were as follows: regular users had 180 mg or more of ivermectin and irregular users had up to 60 mg, in total, throughout the program. Comparisons were made between non-users (subjects who did not use ivermectin), and regular and irregular users after multivariate adjustments. The full city database was used to calculate and compare COVID-19 infection and the risk of dying from COVID-19. The COVID-19 database was used and propensity score matching (PSM) was employed for hospitalization and mortality rates.

Results

Among 223,128 subjects from the city of Itajai, 159,560 were 18 years old or up and were not infected by COVID-19 until July 7, 2020, from which 45,716 (28.7%) did not use and 113,844 (71.3%) used ivermectin. Among ivermectin users, 33,971 (29.8%) used irregularly (up to 60 mg) and 8,325 (7.3%) used regularly (more than 180 mg). The remaining 71,548 participants were not included in the analysis. COVID-19 infection rate was 49% lower for regular users (3.40%) than non-users (6.64%) (risk rate (RR): 0.51; 95% CI: 0.45-0.58; p < 0.0001), and 25% lower than irregular users (4.54%) (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.66-0.85; p < 0.0001). The infection rate was 32% lower for irregular users than non-users (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.64-0.73; p < 0.0001). Among COVID-19 participants, regular users were older and had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension than irregular and non-users. After PSM, the matched analysis contained 283 subjects in each group of non-users and regular users, between regular users and irregular users, and 1,542 subjects between non-users and irregular users. The hospitalization rate was reduced by 100% in regular users compared to both irregular users and non-users (p < 0.0001), and by 29% among irregular users compared to non-users (RR: 0.781; 95% CI: 0.49-1.05; p = 0.099). Mortality rate was 92% lower in regular users than non-users (RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.02-0.35; p = 0.0008) and 84% lower than irregular users (RR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04-0.71; p = 0.016), while irregular users had a 37% lower mortality rate reduction than non-users (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.40-0.99; p = 0.049). Risk of dying from COVID-19 was 86% lower among regular users than non-users (RR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.03-0.57; p = 0.006), and 72% lower than irregular users (RR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.07-1.18; p = 0.083), while irregular users had a 51% reduction compared to non-users (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.32-0.76; p = 0.001).

Conclusion

Non-use of ivermectin was associated with a 12.5-fold increase in mortality rate and a seven-fold increased risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to the regular use of ivermectin. This dose-response efficacy reinforces the prophylactic effects of ivermectin against COVID-19.

#### Ivermectin RCT in Israel: 2.6X more likely for outpatient infection to go away - preprint May 2021** Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19 – A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial **[doi: https](https://doi.org/https)://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.21258081

Background Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic agent, also has anti-viral properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral shedding in patients at an early-stage of COVID-19 infection.

Methods The double-blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0·2 mg/kg for 3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RT-PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days. Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30 (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination of viral culture viability.

Results Eighty-nine patients were eligible (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years. Females accounted for 21·6%, and 16·8% were asymptomatic at recruitment. Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical differences in these parameters between the two groups.

On day 6, 34 out of 47 (** 72% **) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared to 21/ 42 (** 50% **) in the placebo arm (OR 2·62; 95% CI: 1·09-6·31). In a multivariable logistic-regression model, the odds of a negative test at day 6 was**  2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group **(95% CI: 1·06–6·45). Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13·0%) of ivermectin samples vs. 14/29 (48·2%) in the placebo group (p=0·008).

Conclusions There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these patients.

#### 7X less morbidity in those African countries using Ivermectin - March 26, 2021** Why COVID-19 is not so spread in Africa: How does Ivermectin affect it? **Preprint - [doi: https](https://doi.org/https)://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.21254377

Background: Scientists have so far been unable to determine the reason for the low number of COVID-19 cases in Africa.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of ivermectin interventions for onchocerciasis on the morbidity, mortality, recovery, and fatality rates caused by COVID-19.

Method: A retrospective statistical analysis study of the impact of ivermectin against COVID-19 between the 31 onchocerciasis-endemic countries using the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) and the non-endemic 22 countries in Africa. The morbidity, mortality, recovery rate, and fatality rate caused by COVID-19 were calculated from the WHO situation report in Africa. We investigated the onchocerciasis endemic 31 countries and the non-endemic 22 countries. Statistical comparisons used by the Welch test of them in the two groups were made.

Results: The morbidity and mortality were statistically significantly less in the 31 countries using CDTI. The recovery and fatality rates were not statistically significant difference. The average life expectancy was statistically significantly higher in the non-endemic countries.

Conclusions: The morbidity and mortality in the onchocerciasis endemic countries are lesser than those in the non-endemic ones. The community-directed onchocerciasis** treatment with ivermectin is the most reasonable explanation for the decrease in morbidity and fatality rate in Africa **. In areas where ivermectin is distributed to and used by the entire population, it leads to a significant reduction in mortality.

#### Countries using prophylactic chemotherapy with Ivermectin have far fewer COVID-19 infections - Jan 2021** A COVID-19 prophylaxis? Lower incidence associated with prophylactic administration of ivermectin **Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2021 Jan;57(1):106248.

Another chart shows similar reduction for African countries

As COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) continues to rapidly spread throughout the world, the incidence varies greatly among different countries. These differences raise the question whether nations with a lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used not only to explain that lower incidence but also to provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such a treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) transmission, thereby effectively slowing the spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines.

Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including ivermectin have a significantly lower incidence of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain the persistence of such an inhibitory effect after serum levels of ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.
