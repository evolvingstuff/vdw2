### Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Prevention of Mood and Anxiety Disorders.

Clin Psychopharmacol Neurosci. 2015 Aug 31;13(2):129-37. [doi: 10.9758/cpn.2015.13.2.129.](https://doi.org/10.9758/cpn.2015.13.2.129.)

Psychiatric disorders in general, and major depression and anxiety disorders in particular, account for a large burden of disability, morbidity and premature mortality worldwide. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have a range of neurobiological activities in modulation of neurotransmitters, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and neuroplasticity, which could contribute to psychotropic effects. Here we reviewed recent research on the benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplements in prevention against major depression, bipolar disorders, interferon-α-induced depression patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection, and  **posttraumatic stress disorder** . The biological mechanisms underlying omega-3 PUFAs'psychotropic effects are proposed and reviewed. Nutrition is a modifiable environmental factor that might be important in prevention medicine, which have been applied for many years in the secondary prevention of heart disease with omega-3 PUFAs. This review extends the notion that nutrition in psychiatry is a modifiable environmental factor and calls for more researches on prospective clinical studies to justify the preventive application of omega-3 PUFAs in daily practice.

 **Studies have found Omega-3 and Vitamin D both associated with reduced PTSD and mood disorders** 

 **Would be nice to have an intervention study using both of them**
