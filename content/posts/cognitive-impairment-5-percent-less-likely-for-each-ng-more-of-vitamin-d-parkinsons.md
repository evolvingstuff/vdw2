This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), hoping to provide possible ideas for the diagnosis and prevention of PD with cognitive impairment. Vitamin D is a neurosteroid with neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions, playing an important role in PD and its progression. In the present study, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly decreased in PD patients (45.86 ± 14.81 nmol/L) compared to healthy controls(56.54 ± 14.00 nmol/L) (P < 0.001), and significant differences were also observed in PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD patients with dementia (PDD)(P < 0.05). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and Montreal cognitive assessment(MoCA) scores (r = 0.489,P < 0.001).

The increased serum 25(OH)D was an independent protective factor of cognitive impairment in PD ( **OR = 0. 949** , P = 0.005), and the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC under the ROC curve area of serum 25(OH)D were 53.3%, 86.5%, and 0.713, respectively. These findings support the relationship between cognitive impairment and Vitamin D in PD patients. Serum 25(OH)D may be a useful biomarker for diagnosing cognitive impairment in patients with PD.
