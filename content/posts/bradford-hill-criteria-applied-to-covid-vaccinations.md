The following transcript does not include the first 5 seconds

The epidemiological construct that we have to go through is called the Bradford Hill tenets of causality. 

So the first question is, is it a large signal? 

Is it a large epidemiologic signal? And I tell you it's astronomical. All the vaccines combined in the United States per year, it's no more than 150 deaths, not temporally related. Here we are over 21,000 deaths, so clearly it's a massive signal. Number one. 

Number two, is there a dangerous mechanism of action? The answer is yes. Frankly, we know the vaccines have a dangerous mechanism of action, they install production of the spike protein.

The spike protein is what makes the respiratory infection lethal, and it follows that in some people, excessive production of the spike protein in a vulnerable person would be lethal after a vaccine. 

The third criteria is, is it internally consistent? Are there other conditions that are now acknowledged that they themselves could be fatal? And the answer is sure, with myocarditis, FDA agrees, all the regulatory experts agree that the vaccines cause myocarditis. Can it be fatal? Yes. Have there been fatal cases published? Yes, by Verma and Choy as an example, those are publications. 

 **There are over 200 peer-reviewed publications of myocarditis** . How about other forms of death? Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura. Thrombosis, blood clots, variety of other... Stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction, a variety of other lethal syndromes.

There's over 1000 peer-reviewed papers published on fatal and non-fatal outcomes. 

So that criteria is met. So it's internally consistent. Is it externally consistent? So it's consistent with the yellow card system, the Eudora(?) system, and the US VAERS system. 

And finally, is it temporally related?

Yes, it's very tightly temporally related. So I've just gone through the exercise. It is beyond any shadow of a doubt that the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths, it's unequivocal, it is unassailable, those conclusions, and I'm a card-carrying epidemiologist, I'm telling you, the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.

#### Wikipedia: Bradford Hill Criteria [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria)

1.  **Strength**  ([effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size)): A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.

1.  **Consistency**  ([reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility)): Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.

1.  **Specificity** : Causation is likely if there is a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>

1.  **Temporality** : The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).

1.  **Biological gradient**  ([dose–response relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose–response_relationship)): Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>

1.  **[Plausibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_plausibility)** : A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).

1.  **Coherence** : Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that "lack of such <span>[laboratory]</span> evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations".

1.  **Experiment** : "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".

1.  **Analogy** : The use of analogies or similarities between the observed association and any other associations.
