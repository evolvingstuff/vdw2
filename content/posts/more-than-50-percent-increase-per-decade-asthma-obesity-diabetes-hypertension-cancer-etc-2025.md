##### Substantial Age-Related Increases in Health Conditions Perplexity AI – Deep Research

Certain health conditions show dramatic increases in prevalence as people age, with some rising by more than 50% per decade of life. This report examines these substantial age-related increases across different life stages, focusing on conditions with the most significant growth patterns.

##### Ages 0-10

During early childhood, few chronic conditions show the dramatic increases seen in later life, but some notable patterns emerge:

*  **Asthma** : Prevalence increases from 2.7% in ages 0-4 to 7.0% in ages 5-11, representing a 159% increase [9](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/most_recent_national_asthma_data.htm) [12](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma-data/about/most-recent-asthma-data.html). This substantial jump may be related to increased exposure to environmental triggers and improved diagnostic capabilities in school-aged children.

##### Ages 10-25

As individuals progress through adolescence into young adulthood, several conditions begin to show marked increases:

*  **Asthma** : Continues to rise, reaching 12.0% among ages 20-24, reflecting a 52% increase from the 7.9% seen in teenagers (ages 12-17) [12](https://www.cdc.gov/asthma-data/about/most-recent-asthma-data.html) [15](https://www.lung.org/research/trends-in-lung-disease/asthma-trends-brief/current-demographics). The transition from pediatric to adult healthcare during this period may also affect diagnosis rates.

*  **Type 2 Diabetes** : Historically rare in young people, diagnoses have increased significantly, with rates rising 50% from 8 to 12 per 100,000 youth aged 10-14 between 2002 and 2012 [13](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-link-age). Childhood obesity and decreased physical activity are driving these concerning trends.

*  **Obesity** : Growing rapidly in this age group, with overall youth obesity (ages 2-19) increasing from 17.7% to 21.5% between 2011-2012 and 2017 [17](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9315946/). By age 25, obesity affects 41.8% of females and 33.9% of males [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673624015484).

##### Ages 25-45

This life stage sees dramatic increases in several chronic conditions:

*  **Type 2 Diabetes** : Prevalence jumps from 1.6% in ages 18-29 to 7.7% in ages 30-39, representing a 381% increase over roughly a decade [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3357227/). This corresponds with age-related metabolic changes and lifestyle factors.

*  **Hypertension** : Shows substantial increases, rising from 22.4% in ages 18-39 to 54.5% in ages 40-59, with much of this increase occurring during the 25-45 age range [2](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db364-h.pdf). Men show higher rates than women in this age group.

*  **ADHD (diagnosed)** : Interestingly, diagnosed ADHD prevalence increases from 21.7% in adults ages 18-24 to 62.8% in ages 25-29, nearly tripling [6](https://chadd.org/about-adhd/general-prevalence-adults/). This likely reflects improved recognition and diagnosis rather than true incidence increases.

*  **Obesity** : Continues to rise, with significant growth in severe obesity (BMI ≥35) during these years, disproportionately affecting women [5](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm) [11](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity).

##### Ages 45-65

Middle age brings accelerated increases in several serious health conditions:

*  **Cancer** : Incidence rises dramatically from approximately 350 cases per 100,000 people among those aged 45-49 to more than 1,000 per 100,000 in those 60 and older [3](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age). This represents a nearly 200% increase within this age range.

*  **Hypertension** : Prevalence continues to increase significantly, from 54.5% in ages 40-59 to 74.5% in those 60 and over [2](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db364-h.pdf).. This 37% increase represents millions of additional affected individuals.

*  **Arthritis** : Shows rapid acceleration during this period, eventually affecting 53.9% of adults age 75 and older [7](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db497.pdf). The growth is particularly notable after age 50.

*  **Type 2 Diabetes** : Prevalence increases from about 8.6% at ages 40-50 to 14% among those 45-64, and reaches 25% in those 65 and older [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3357227/) [13](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/diabetes-link-age). This represents more than a doubling during this life stage.

##### Ages 65+

The senior years show the highest prevalence of many conditions, with some continuing to increase dramatically with advancing age:

*  **Dementia** : Shows perhaps the most dramatic age-related increase of any condition, rising from 3% among those aged 65-69 to 35% in people 90 and older - more than a tenfold increase [8](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-10-older-americans-has-dementia). Overall, 10% of adults 65+ have dementia and another 22% have mild cognitive impairment.

*  **Cancer** : Incidence continues to climb with age, with the median age of cancer diagnosis being 66 years [3](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age). Different cancer types show varying age-related patterns.

*  **Hypertension** : Reaches its peak prevalence of 74.5% in those 60 and older [2](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db364-h.pdf). The combination with other age-related conditions creates significant health risks.

*  **Stroke** : Risk increases substantially with age, with rates more than doubling from ages 15-49 (50.29 per 100,000) to the general older population (approximately 150 per 100,000) [4](https://www.world-stroke.org/assets/downloads/WSO_Global_Stroke_Fact_Sheet.pdf).

##### Conclusion

The analysis reveals distinct patterns of health condition prevalence across different life stages. While some conditions like asthma show significant increases in childhood and adolescence, others like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and arthritis demonstrate dramatic increases in middle age. The most substantial increases overall are seen in dementia prevalence among the oldest populations.

These patterns highlight the importance of age-appropriate preventive care and screening. Many of these conditions share risk factors like diet, physical activity levels, and environmental exposures, suggesting that integrated prevention strategies could address multiple conditions simultaneously. Understanding these age-related increases can help healthcare systems allocate resources effectively and target interventions to the appropriate age groups.
