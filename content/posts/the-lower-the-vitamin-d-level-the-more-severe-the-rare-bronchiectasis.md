Introduction Vitamin-D deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of respiratory infections. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and clinical importance of vitamin-D deficiency in patients with bronchiectasis.

Methods 25-hydroxyvitamin-D was measured by immunoassay in 402 stable patients with bronchiectasis. Patients were classified as vitamin-D deficient (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D <25?nmol/l), insufficient (25?nmol/lâ€“74?nmol/l) or sufficient (?75?nmol/l). Disease severity was assessed, including exacerbation frequency, measurement of airway inflammatory markers, sputum bacteriology and lung function over 3?years follow-up.

Results 50% of bronchiectasis patients were vitamin-D deficient, 43% insufficient and only 7% sufficient. 

This compared to only 12% of age and sex matched controls with vitamin-D deficiency (p<0.0001). 

Vitamin-D deficient patients were more frequently chronically colonised with bacteria (p<0.0001), 21.4% of vitamin-D deficient subjects were colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to 10.4% of insufficient patients and 3.6% of sufficient patients, p=0.003. Vitamin-D deficient patients had lower FEV1% predicted (p=0.002), and more frequent pulmonary exacerbations (p=0.04). Vitamin-D deficient patients had higher sputum levels of inflammatory markers and demonstrated a more rapid decline in lung function over 3?years follow-up. Defects in neutrophil function and assessment of airway LL-37 levels did not provide a mechanistic explanation for these findings. Vitamin-D deficient patients had, however, higher levels of Vitamin-D Binding Protein in sputum sol.

Conclusions Vitamin-D deficiency is common in bronchiectasis and correlates with markers of disease severity. The mechanism of this association is unclear.

# Comment and summary by VitaminDWiki

* It is generally a rare disease: 1 in 100,000   (rare is < 1 in 1,500 people)

* It occurs more often in New Zealand [3.4 in 100,000 ](http://dnmeds.otago.ac.nz/departments/womens/paediatrics/research/nzpsu/pdf/bronchiectasis.pdf%20) (note that NZ has low level of vitamin D]

### Vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng)

* 12% general population

* 50% bronchiectasis patients

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa

* 21% if < 10 ng

* 10% if  10 to 30 ng

* 4% if > 30 ng
