Background. Hypovitaminosis D is associated with cognitive decline among older adults. The relationship between vitamin D intakes and cognitive decline is not well understood. Our objective was to determine whether the dietary intake of vitamin D was an independent predictor of the onset of dementia within 7 years among women aged 75 years and older.

Methods. Four hundred and ninety-eight community-dwelling women (mean, 79.8 ± 3.8 years) free of vitamin D supplements from the EPIDemiology of OSteoporosis Toulouse cohort study were divided into three groups according to the onset of dementia within 7 years (ie, no dementia, Alzheimer’s disease <span>[AD]</span>, or other dementias). Baseline vitamin D dietary intakes were estimated from self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Age, body mass index, initial cognitive performance, education level, physical activity, sun exposure, disability, number of chronic diseases, hypertension, depression, use of psychoactive drugs, and baseline season were considered as potential confounders.

Results. Women who developed AD (n = 70) had lower baseline vitamin D intakes (mean, 50.3 ± 19.3 ?g/wk) than nondemented (n = 361; mean intake = 59.0 ± 29.9 ?g/wk, p = .027) or those who developed other dementias (n = 67; mean intake = 63.6 ± 38.1 ?g/wk, p = .010). There was no difference between other dementias and no dementia (p = .247). Baseline vitamin D dietary intakes were associated with the onset of AD (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99 <span>[95% confidence interval = 0.98–0.99]</span>, p = .041) but not with other dementias (p = .071). 

Being in the highest quintile of vitamin D dietary intakes was associated with a lower risk of AD compared with the lower 4 quintiles combined (adjusted odds ratio = 0.23 <span>[95% confidence interval = 0.08–0.67]</span>, p = .007).

Conclusions. Higher vitamin D dietary intake was associated with a lower risk of developing AD among older women.

Paper indicated that the top quintile had about 600 IU vitamin D daily from food.

So, it appears that just 600 IU of vitamin D resulted in 4X less incidence of Alzheimer's Disease

Abstract The role of vitamin D in skeletal health is well established, but more recent findings have also linked vitamin D deficiency to a range of non-skeletal conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke and metabolic disorders including diabetes. Cognitive impairment and dementia must now be added this list. Vitamin D receptors are widespread in brain tissue, and vitamin D's biologically active form <span>[1,25(OH)(2)D3]</span> has shown neuroprotective effects including the clearance of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease. Associations have been noted between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and Alzheimer's disease and dementia in both Europe and the US. 

Similarly, the risk of cognitive impairment was  **up to four times greater**  in the severely deficient elders (25(OH)D <?25 nmol/L) in comparison with individuals with adequate levels (??75 nmol/L). Further studies have also shown associations between low 25(OH)D concentrations and cerebrovascular events such as large vessel infarcts, risk of cerebrovascular accident and fatal stroke. Cross-sectional studies cannot establish temporal relationships because cognitive decline and the onset of dementia itself may influence vitamin D concentrations through behavioural and dietary changes. However, two large prospective studies recently indicated that low vitamin D concentrations may increase the risk of cognitive decline. Large, well designed randomized controlled trials are now needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is effective at preventing or treating Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
