 **Question**   I want to find which vitamin D-related diseases increase the risk of other vitamin D-related diseases. Please use the attached 91 pairs of associations but look elsewhere as well. It would be nice if you could report on the strenght of the association as well. ( example: Disease X increases the risk of Disease Y by 5x)
