### Vitamin D Research, Disinformation playbook against vitamin D, MAHA hope - Grant March 2025

 **[YouTube, 54 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUiXCT71VOU)** 

 **GLASP AI Summary** 

* (00:01-01:31) Dr. William B. Grant, PhD in physics with a 30-year atmospheric sciences career, founded the Sunlight Nutrition and Health Research Center in 2004 after studying UVB radiation and vitamin D since 1999.

* (01:31-04:52) Big Pharma utilizes the "disinformation playbook" against vitamin D because it reduces their income, including tactics like counterfeit science, harassing scientists, manufacturing uncertainty, buying credibility through alliances, and manipulating government officials.

* (07:30-10:24) Competing vitamin D recommendations exist: The 2011 Institute of Medicine recommends 20 ng/ml focusing only on bone health, while the Endocrine Society recommends above 30 ng/ml, with a new 2024 Endocrine Society committee controversially recommending supplements only for ages 1-18 and over 75.

* (10:24-14:06) Most "mega trials" of vitamin D are improperly designed based on pharmaceutical drug guidelines rather than nutrient needs (allowing placebo groups to take supplements, enrolling non-deficient individuals, using low supplement doses, not analyzing by achieved blood levels).

* (16:12-21:20) Analysis of prospective cohort studies shows vitamin D concentrations above 30 ng/ml significantly reduce risk of stroke (60%), cardiovascular disease (55%), dementia (50%), and 8 of the 10 leading causes of death in the US, with benefits most evident when follow-up periods are shorter.

* (23:43-27:34) Seasonal variations show 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels drop in winter when mortality increases by 30%, with a newly discovered mechanism showing vitamin D accumulates in skeletal muscle cells providing functional storage during winter months.

* (27:34-29:05) A recent analysis shows vitamin D supplementation reduced COVID-19 incidence by 60% in randomized trials, by 41% in analytical studies, and ICU admission by 68%, supporting Dr. Grant's early 2020 paper proposing vitamin D's role in reducing COVID risk.

* (29:05-31:21) With new leadership at the  CDC, FDA, and NIH in 2025, there's hope for greater acceptance of vitamin D supplementation for reducing infectious and chronic diseases, though proper study design for nutrients (restricting to deficient subjects and analyzing by achieved levels) remains critical.

### The problems with healthcare in the U.S. - Grant 2017

By William B. Grant, PhD.

Elisabeth Rosenthal, MD, spoke at the Commonwealth Club on December 13, 2017. 

Her new book is  **An American Sickness; How healthcare became big business and how you can take it back** . Penguin Press, 2017. 

Her main message is that healthcare in the U.S. has morphed from one based on care to one based on business principles of maximizing income and profit. She gave examples of receiving emergency care in other countries for a fraction of what similar care would cost in the U.S.

She also discussed how the healthcare industry has gamed the system, such as by obtaining patents for drugs that slightly extend the capabilities of existing drugs. Turns out that drug approvals by the FDA only consider effectiveness and safety, not cost or comparison with other drugs or approaches. An example she gave was Vanda's new sleep drug, which is just a modified form of melatonin, but is very expensive. (see below).

She also pointed out that insurance companies do not contest charges although they may negotiate them down. One reason they give is that to contest them, they may have to go to court. Another reason is that if the charge is from a large hospital or treatment system, they do not want to anger them and lose their business. Also, insurance companies know they can pass on the costs to the insured.

Not mentioned by her but discussed with another member of the audience is that  **physicians only recommend standard treatments** . In his case, he was diagnosed with 80% arterial blockage and underwent triple bypass surgery at Stanford Medical Hospital. The bill was $500k, which the insurance company "negotiated down" to $300k. However, Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, John McDougall, and others have shown that switching to a low-fat vegan diet can clear blocked arteries quickly and without surgery or a large pile of money.

### The Disinformation Playbook

Vitamin D does not fit into the business model of health care in the U.S. I recently heard a program at the Commonwealth Club on how tobacco and  oil and coal interests and the National Football League cast doubt on evidence that their product was causing great harm. They all followed [The Disinformation Playbook](https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/disinformation-playbook#.WjK4H1WnFpg) Union of Concerned Scientists – Dec 2017

### 1) The Fake

#### Conduct counterfeit science and try to pass it off as legitimate research

 **Examples** 

* How Georgia-Pacific Knowingly Published Fake Science on the Safety of  **Asbestos** 

* Industry Groups Used Cherry-Picked Science to Avoid Regulation of  **Chromium** 

* Merck Manipulated the Science about the Drug  **Vioxx** 

* Fossil Fuel Companies Distorted the Science about the Dangers of  **Benzene** 

### 2) The Blitz

#### Harass scientists who speak out with results or views inconvenient for industry

 **Examples** 

* The NFL Tried to Intimidate Scientists Studying the Link between Pro Football and  **Traumatic Brain Injury** 

* Syngenta Harassed the Scientist Who Exposed Risks of its Herbicide  **Atrazine** 

* How the Fossil Fuel Industry Harassed Climate Scientist Michael Mann

* GlaxoSmithKline Tried to Silence the Scientist Who Exposed the Dangers of its Drug  **Avand** 

### 3) The Diversion

#### Manufacture uncertainty about science where little or none exists

 **Examples** 

* How Fossil Fuel Lobbyists Used “Astroturf” Front Groups to Confuse the Public

* The Corn Refiners Association Used Front Groups to Spread Disinformation about Sugar and Health

* The Indoor Tanning Association Used Misleading Ad Campaigns to Distort Skin Cancer Science

* How the American Chemistry Council Sowed Uncertainty about Formaldehyde Risks

### 4) The Screen

#### Buy credibility through alliances with academia or professional societies

 **Examples** 

* How Coca-Cola Disguised Its Influence on Science about Sugar and Health

* The Fossil Fuel Industry Hid the Truth about Its Funding of Fracking Research

* Philip Morris Funds University Research—with Strings Attached

* The Case of ExxonMobil and the American Geophysical Union

### 5) The Fix

#### Manipulate government officials or processes to inappropriately influence policy

 **Examples** 

* How Dow Chemical Influenced the EPA to Ignore the Scientific Evidence on Chlorpyrifos *** *** 

* Pfizer Pressured the FDA to Downplay the Risks of Its Arsenical Animal Drug

* How the NRA Suppressed Gun Violence Research

* BP and Other Companies Exploited a Regulatory Agency to Continue Negligent Offshore Drilling

I looked at the evidence to see whether that is being done for vitamin D and the answer is an emphatic yes.

### Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki, sees 3) The Diversion, frequently

Vitamin D Studies which appear to intentionally confuse the public are frequently wrong - in 5 to 12 ways

I was confused about net neutrality - then found that was confusion was strategy of the lobbyists
