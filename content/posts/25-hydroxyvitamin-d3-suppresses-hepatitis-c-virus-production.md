### 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 suppresses hepatitis C virus production

Hepatology. 2012 Oct;56(4):1231-9. [doi: 10.1002/hep.25763.](https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.25763.)

Because the current interferon (IFN)-based treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has a therapeutic limitation and side effects, a more efficient therapeutic strategy is desired. Recent studies show that supplementation of vitamin D significantly improves sustained viral response via IFN-based therapy. However, mechanisms and an active molecular form of vitamin D for its anti-HCV effects have not been fully clarified. To address these questions, we infected HuH-7 cells with cell culture-generated HCV in the presence or absence of vitamin D(3) or its metabolites. 

To our surprise, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) <span>[25(OH)D(3) ]</span>, but not vitamin D(3) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) , reduced the extra- and intracellular levels of HCV core antigen in a concentration-dependent manner. Single-cycle virus production assay with a CD81-negative cell line reveals that the inhibitory effect of 25(OH)D(3) is at the level of infectious virus assembly but not entry or replication. Long-term 25(OH)D(3) treatment generates a HCV mutant with acquired resistance to 25(OH)D(3) , and this mutation resulting in a N1279Y substitution in the nonstructural region 3 helicase domain is responsible for the resistance. Conclusion: 25(OH)D(3) is a novel anti-HCV agent that targets an infectious viral particle assembly step. This finding provides insight into the improved efficacy of anti-HCV treatment via the combination of vitamin D(3) and IFN. 

Our results also suggest that 25(OH)D(3) , not vitamin D(3) , is a better therapeutic option in patients with hepatic dysfunction and reduced enzymatic activity for generation of 25(OH)D(3) .

 **25(OH)D(3) =Calcidiol is better than Vitamin D for reducing HCV** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">This should not be a surprise. The virus reduces the liver's ability to convert Vitamin D into 25(OH)D(3)</span>**

### Association between vitamin D and hepatitis C virus infection: a meta-analysis. - Sept 2013

World J Gastroenterol. 2013 Sep 21;19(35):5917-24. [doi: 10.3748/wjg.v19.i35.5917.](https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v19.i35.5917.)

AIM:

To evaluate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and  **sustained virological response (SVR)**  in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected individuals.

METHODS:

Relevant studies were identified by systematically searching MEDLINE databases up to March 2012 and abstracts of the European and American Congress of Hepatology conducted in 2011. Studies must provide information on SVR and the levels of 25(OH)D₃ and/or 25(OH)D₂ <span>[henceforth referred to as 25(OH)D]</span> in sera samples from HCV infected individuals. The inclusion criteria were: clinical studies that included HCV infected patients aged older than 18 years regardless of HCV genotype or ethnic group; provided information on SVR rates; and were reported in the English language as full papers. Due to the heterogeneity of studies in categorizing serum vitamin D levels, a cut-off value of 30 ng/mL of serum 25(OH)D was used. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics. The summary odds ratios with their corresponding 95%CI were calculated based on a random-effects model.

RESULTS:

Overall, 11 studies (8 observational and 3 interventional) involving 1575 individuals were included and 1117 HCV infected individuals (71%) showed low vitamin D levels. Most of the studies included mono-infected HCV individuals with the mean age ranging from 38 to 56 years. Four studies were conducted in human immunodeficiency virus/HCV infected individuals. Regarding vitamin D measurement, most of the studies employed radioimmunoassays (n = 5) followed by chemiluminescence (n = 4) and just one study employed high performance/pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Basal vitamin D levels varied from 17 to 43 ng/mL in the studies selected, and most of the HCV infected individuals had genotype 1 (1068/1575) with mean viral load varying from log 4.5-5.9 UI/mL. With regard to HCV treatment, most of the studies (n = 8) included HCV individuals without previous treatment, where the pooled SVR rate was 46.4%. High rates of SVR were observed in HCV individuals with vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL (OR = 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12-2.2) and those supplemented with vitamin D (OR = 4.59; 95%CI: 1.67-12.63) regardless of genotype.

CONCLUSION:

Our results demonstrated high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and high SVR in individuals with higher serum vitamin D levels or receiving vitamin D supplementation.
