 **Simple Summary** 

A significant proportion of people with cancer use forms of complementary medicine. Many factors contribute to cancer including some which are modifiable by the patient, such as stress, poor nutrition, vitamin D deficiency, poor sleep and lack of physical activity. This paper discusses why it is important that oncologists help cancer patients to address such factors, and why an integrative approach which combines evidence-based complementary medicines or therapies with orthodox treatment might lead to better outcomes for cancer patients.

 **Abstract** 

A significant proportion of cancer patients use forms of complementary medicine or therapies. An integrative approach to cancer management combines conventional medicine with evidence-based complementary medicines/therapies and lifestyle interventions, for the treatment and prevention of disease and the optimisation of health. Its basis is a holistic one; to treat the whole person, not just the disease. It makes use of adjunct technologies which may assist the clinician in diagnosis of early carcinogenesis and monitoring of treatment effectiveness. Many factors contribute to the development of cancer including some which are largely modifiable by the patient and which oncologists may be in a position to advise on, such as 

* stress, 

* poor nutrition, 

* lack of physical activity, 

* poor sleep, and 

*  **Vitamin D deficiency** 

An integrative approach to addressing these factors may contribute to better overall health of the patient and better outcomes. Evidence-based complementary medicine approaches include the use of supplements, herbal medicine, various practices that reduce stress, and physical therapies. Individualised to the patient, these can also help address the symptoms and signs associated with cancer and its orthodox treatment
