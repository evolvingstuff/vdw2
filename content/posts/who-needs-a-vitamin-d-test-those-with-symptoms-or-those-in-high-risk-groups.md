 **A variety of Vitamin D Testing Opinions** 

1. Many countries have decided that testing everyone for Vitamin D costs too much and have restricted testing

   * Which is a mistake because the resulting Vitamin D deficiency problems are far more costly

   * Some allow testing, but the patient has to pay for it

   * US Medicare (incorrectly) only pays for 1 vitamin D test per lifetime

1. Some groups suggest limiting testing to those with a few narrowly defined symptoms

1. Some groups are testing only individuals in groups at high risk for being deficient (dark skin, obese, pregnant, etc)

1. Some  groups have decided to suggest Vitamin D to all members of high risk groups

1. Some groups have decided to suggest Vitamin D for everyone

1. Turkey decided to give free vitamin D to all children
