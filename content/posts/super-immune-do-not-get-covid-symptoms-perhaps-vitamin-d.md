#### Haven’t had COVID yet? Wanna bet? - Aug 2022

 **[MDEdge](https://www.mdedge.com/rheumatology/article/256801/covid-19-updates/havent-had-covid-yet-wanna-bet?ecd=WNL_eve_220803_mdedge)** 

* "A follow-up analysis of 95 studies, [published last December](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2787098), reached similar findings, estimating that more than 40% of COVID-19 infections didn’t come with symptoms."

* "As Dr. tenOever and Dr. Sanjana suggest, another intriguing line of research has found that prior viral infections may prime the body’s immune system to fight COVID-19."

   * Note: T cells are produced by the innate immune system, which is helped by Vitamin D

* "The new work builds on a prior research he helped lead that found 40%-60% of people never exposed to SARS-CoV-2 had T cells that reacted to the virus – with their immune systems recognizing fragments of a virus they had never seen before."

#### Vitamin D improves 2 parts of the immune system, but only the innate can fight mutated virus

#### INNATE immune system uses interferons to announce an invader (which is helped by Vitamin D)

 **[The Coronavirus Has One Strategy We Can’t Vaccinate Against = Atlantic Magazine](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/08/coronavirus-variants-viral-transmission-interferons/671047/?utm_source=feed)** 

* "It may be getting better at dodging one of the immune system’s main defenses."

* "Interferons, meanwhile, are the ultimate generalists, a set of catch-all burglar alarms. Even if the body has never seen a particular pathogen before and no relevant antibodies are present, cells will make interferons as soon as they realize a virus is around—“any and all viruses,” "

* "Interferons, then, can make or break a host’s fate. Researchers have found that people whose [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972995/nterferons are weak or laggy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972995/nterferons%20are%20weak%20or%20laggy) after catching the coronavirus are far more likely to get very seriously sick.

#### It is essential that the Vitamin D actually gets to the cells of the immune system

##### The Vitamin D Receptor can greatly limit Vitamin D from getting to cells

##### Founder superimmunity? 200 ng vitamin D, VDR activators (10), Zinc, 800 mg Mg, Omega-3. etc

 **No COVID symptoms so far** 

Note:Several people have reported to me:> 50 ng of vitamin D but no symptpms but their family members did
