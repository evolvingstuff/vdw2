* "...the IRS alert sets a higher bar for using these accounts for preventive measures, such as healthy food and fitness, than it does for drugs such as Ozempic, a popular weight-loss medication."

* "Means told Kennedy that Americans have  **$150 billion in health-related tax-advantaged accounts** , which may be why a “pharmaceutical lobbyist who was upset with what we <span>[Truemed]</span> were doing tipped off the IRS.”
