#### A ‘Tripledemic’? Flu and Other Infections Return as Covid Cases Rise - New York Times

 **[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/health/flu-covid-risk.html) &nbsp; <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/tripledemic-compresspdf.pdf">PDF</a>** 

* "R.S.V. causes about 14,000 deaths among adults 65 and older and up to 300 deaths among children under 5 each year."

* "Flu season in the southern hemisphere, typically between May and October, is highly predictive of winters in the northern hemisphere. This year, flu began weeks earlier than usual in Australia and New Zealand, and the number of cases and hospitalizations were markedly higher."<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="700">

* :Dr. Gordon tracks influenza rates among children in Nicaragua, which has one flu season in June and July, and a larger one in the late fall. "

   * Note: the Middle east also has Flu season in the summer - they avoid the hot sun so much that they have little vitamin D in the summer

#### RSV - not just those under age 2, anticipate big outbreak after 2 years of isolation - Oct 29, 2022

 **[R.S.V. Cases Are Rising. Here’s What You Need to Know - New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/rsv-symptoms-treatment.html)** 

* "In a normal prepandemic year, 1 to 2 percent of babies younger than 6 months with an R.S.V. infection may need to be hospitalized. And virtually all children have gotten an R.S.V. infection by the time they are 2 years old."

* “Adults still get R.S.V. fairly regularly and they can get reinfected multiple times throughout adulthood,”

* "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 177,000 older adults are hospitalized with R.S.V. each year and 14,000 of them die."

* "Those at highest risk for severe infections include premature infants, babies under 6 months of age, infants and toddlers with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease, as well as children with weakened immune systems and those who have neuromuscular disorders that make it difficult to clear out mucus."

   * Note: Many of these are associated with low Vitamin D
