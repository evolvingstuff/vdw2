"Vitamin D?Restoration of vitamin D levels to normal can yield increases in HDL of 10, 20, even 30 mg/dl, though it may require up to a year for the full effect to show."

#### Vitamin D supplementation may improve HDL cholesterol levels

July 2009  J Clin Lipidol 2009;

"Each 10-ng/ml increment in serum vitamin D level was associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol of 3.80–4.20 mg/dl (0.10–0.11 mmol/l) following adjustment for established determinants of HDL cholesterol."

BACKGROUND: Adequate calcium intake can have a favorable effect on some metabolic variables.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the effects of daily calcium intake and of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D (calcium+D) during a weight-loss intervention on blood pressures, plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, and glucose and insulin concentrations in low calcium consumers.

DESIGN: Healthy, overweight or obese women (n = 63) with a daily calcium intake of < 800 mg/d were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to 1 of 2 groups: the group consuming 2 tablets/d of a calcium + vitamin D supplement (600 mg elemental calcium and 200 IU vitamin D/tablet) or the group consuming placebo; both groups observed a 700 kcal/d energy restriction. These 63 women then completed a 15-wk weight-loss intervention.

RESULTS: Initial daily calcium intake was significantly correlated with plasma HDL cholesterol (r = 0.41, P < 0.001) and with 2-h postload glycemia (r = -0.29, P < 0.05) during an oral-glucose-tolerance test, independent of fat mass and waist circumference. After the 15-wk intervention, significantly greater decreases in total:LDL and LDL:HDL (P < 0.01 for both) and of LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05) were observed in the calcium+D group than in the placebo group. The differences in total:HDL and LDL:HDL were independent of changes in fat mass and in waist circumference. A tendency for more beneficial changes in HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and total cholesterol was also observed in the calcium+D group (P = 0.08).

CONCLUSION: Consumption of calcium+D during a weight-loss intervention enhanced the beneficial effect of body weight loss on the lipid and lipoprotein profile in overweight or obese women with usual low daily calcium intake. PMID: 17209177
