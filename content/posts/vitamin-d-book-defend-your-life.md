Susan Rex Ryan learned about vitamin D and defended her life

### Review of book by VitaminDWiki March 2014

Nothing new vs other books, very wordy, a little out of date, no graphics, some errors

#### Errors of commission

Colorectal cancer is not just colon cancer, it is also rectal cancer

Calciferol incorrectly said to be D2  rather than D2 and D3

MS said to have no cure – she seems to have missed the publications from Brazil

#### Errors of commission

No mention of the studies showing that D2 DECREASES D3

No mention of needing to increase K2 with increasing D3

No mention of need to decrease Calcium with increasing D3

No mention of need to increase Magnesium with increasing D3 

No mention of Omega-3

No mention of Labcor testing – which is perhaps the biggest and lowest cost Vitamin D test service

No mention of 2X average increase in many of the diseases associated with vitamin D

References often do not include the month of publication

She thinks that active vitamin D provides a better indication of personal Vitamin D history – yet I thought that active vitaminD is highly regulated, so will not change much.

### Recommends a very expensive vitamin D test – not clear what it measures

She mentioned getting an active vitamin D test – which indicated to her that she could have a vitamin D level of 181 ng.  61%  Spectracell  – what does this mean?

Not mention that the full panel of test is $320 or $400.  $170 as co-pay for some insurances,  2-3 week delay  

### [Overview of Spectralcell test procedure](http://neurotalk.psychcentral.com/archive/index.php/t-116383.html%20) on a forum in 2010

* 1. a mixture of lymphocytes is isolated from the blood

* 2. these cells are grown in a defined culture medium containing optimal levels of all essential nutrients necessary to sustain their growth in cell culture

* 3. the T-lymphocytes are stimulated to grow with a mitogen (phytohemagglutinin) and growth is measured by the incorporation of tritiated (radioactive) thymidine into the DNA of the cells

The growth response under optimal conditions is defined as 100%, and all other growth rates are compared to this 100% level of growth.

 **For example, for B6 they say:**  we remove vitamin B6 from the medium and stimulate the cells to grow by mitogen stimulation. Growth is measured by DNA synthesis and the rate of growth is dependent only upon the functional level of vitamin B6 available within the cells to support growth. For vitamin B6 a growth rate of at least 55% of the growth rate observed in the optimal (100%) media is considered normal. Results less than 55% are considered to indicate a functional deficiency for vitamin B6. Each nutrient has a different reference range that was established by assaying thousands of apparently healthy individuals."

From the web it seems that Spectracell measures Vitamin D2, not D3.  Spectracell does not seem to state on their website

Note: Book listing lacks vitamin D keyword, so it does not show up on Amazon search for "Vitamin D"
