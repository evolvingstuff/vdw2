From Merck Veterinary Manual 1998

#### At 400 IU/day the FDA appears to believe that humans require less than the majority of animals in the Merck Vet Manual, and far less than the non-human primates (2,500 IU/kg).

A great many animals have their vitamin D requirements specified in terms of IU per kilogram of dry feed.

Often there is a reduced requirement if the animal has access to sunshine. 

I wonder if vets in the northern latitudes or cloudy areas increase the vitamin D in the feed.  

I also wonder if the vitamin D levels in the feed are increased in the winter months.

Psittacines (large seed eating – macaw, parrot, cockatoo)  **2000 IU/ kg**  of dry feed pg 1850

Ratites (emu, cassowary, ostrich, rhea)  **1,500-2,500 IU/kg**  of dry feed pg 1851

Non-human primates  **2,500 IU/kg** of dry feed pg 1858;  marmosets require up to 4 times that amount =  **10,000 IU/kg**  of dry feed pg 1859

Reptiles  **500-1,000 IU/kg** of dry feed pg 1863

Turtles 1 **,000 IU/kg**  of dry feed pg 1865

Horses   **800 -1,000 IU/kg**  (if not have >4 hours per day of sunshine or have sun-cured hay) pg 1879 -later growth  **500 IU / kg** 

Pigs  **200 IU/kg**  if < 10 kg in weight and  **150  IU/kg** if > 20 kg in weight pg 1891 - “they seem to preferentially use D3” over D2  pg 1896

Dogs  **500 IU/kg** of dry feed pg 1915  minimum

Cats  **700 IU/kg**  growth and reproduction minimum,  **500 IU/kg** adult   maximum  **10,000 IU/kg**  pg 1916

Pekin Ducks  **400 IU/kg**  of dry feed < 7 weeks,  **900 IU/kg**  of dry feed breeding pg 2315

Geese  **200 IU/kg** pg 2315

Leghorn-type chickens  **200 IU/kg** of dry feed until first egg, then  **300 IU/kg**   pg 2316

Turkeys  **1,100 IU/kg**  of dry feed  pg 2318

Note:  Assume* adults eat about 1 kg of dry food per day, the FDA RDA  of 400 IU is less than the RDA for the majority of animals listed.

This edition is on-line at http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp 

1 kg of dry weight  per day = 365 kg/ year. = 803 pounds/year.  

Internet indicates that people eat 1800 pounds of (wet) food per year.  

So I will guess that humans might eat 1kg of dry food per day

The FDA says that we need should have   **400 IU/day** 

I was unable to find dry weight food a person consumes in a short search of the web.
