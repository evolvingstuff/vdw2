### Cholecalciferol loading dose guideline for vitamin D-deficient adults.

Eur J Endocrinol. 2010 Apr;162(4):805-11. Epub 2010 Feb 5.

CONCLUSION: The cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25-OHD(3)  **target level of 75** nmol/l can be calculated as follows: 

 **dose (IU)=40x(75 - serum 25-OHD(3))xbody weight.**

 **To use ng and pound multipy by <span style="color:#00F;">35</span> instead of 40** 

 **&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dose to get <span style="color:#F00;">30</span> ng (in ng and pounds) = <span style="color:#00F;">35 </span>x (<span style="color:#F00;">30 </span>- serum 25-OHD(3)) x body weight.** 

Typically spread over 8 weeks

A very commonly prescribed loading dose in the US is  **50,000 IU per week for 8 weeks, for a total of 400,000 IU** 

 **Example uses of the equation to achieve 30 ng (on average)** 

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dose | starting <br>level | weight |
| 140,000 IU | 10 ng | 200 lb |
| 70,000 IU | 20 ng | 200 lb |
| 105,000 IU | 10 ng | 150 lb |

 

 **Dose to get <span style="color:#F00;">50</span> ng (in ng and pounds) = 35 x (<span style="color:#F00;">50 </span>- serum 25-OHD(3)) x body weight.** 

 **Example uses of the equation to achieve <span style="color:#F00;">50</span> ng (on average)** 

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dose | starting <br>level | weight |
| 280,000 IU | 10 ng | 200 lb |
| 210,000 IU | 20 ng | 200 lb |

 **There is a HUGE variation in response between individuals for the average (equation)**

#### Response to weekly or biweekly dosing

 **for a total of 100,000 IU, 150,000 IU, and 200,000 IU vary a lot between individuals**
