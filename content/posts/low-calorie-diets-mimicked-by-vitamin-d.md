#### VITAMIN D MIMICS LOW-CALORIE DIETS

In addition to increasing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation to diminish fat, vitamin D3 also has the rather unique capacity to mimic low caloric consumption, further driving fat loss. This effect was shown in the afore-mentioned study by Chang et al.  **10** , which found that vitamin D3 activated the molecule SIRT1 an energy-sensing enzyme normally activated by low caloric intake, but in this case, SIRT1 was activated by vitamin D3 intake. Interestingly, in order to trigger SIRT1 function, vitamin D3 increased production of the molecule NAD, which is a compound that represents a low energy state within the cell, which therefore turns on SIRT1. As a result, SIRT1 immediately activates several enzymes that oxidize fatty acids for the replenishment of cellular energy, which also diminishes body fat. Vitamin D3 also cranked up expression of the SIRT1 gene, which likely further enhanced SIRT1-driven fatty acid oxidation and fat loss. In addition, an activated SIRT1 also multiplies the number of mitochondrion within the cell. Since mitochondria function as power generators that burn fat and sugar for energy, more mitochondrion provides fat cells with an even greater capacity to scorch body fat. Taken together, this data indicates that vitamin D3 activation of the NAD-SIRT1 pathway potently contributes to the overall ability of vitamin D to reduce fat mass. SIRT1 can also be activated by resveratrol supplementation, producing favorable effects on body fat composition that are quite similar to vitamin D. Interestingly, recent research showed that resveratrol also stimulates vitamin D3 binding to the vitamin D receptor and the subsequent activation of SIRT1 in certain human cells types in vitro12, implying that the combination of resveratrol with vitamin D3 would be a potent fat-burning stack that should conceivably activate SIRT1 more extensively, generating even more fat loss.

 **Abstract for #12** 

Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia constitute

risk factors for morbidity and premature mortality. Based on

animal and in vitro studies, resveratrol reverts these risk factors

via stimulation of silent mating type information regulation 2

homolog 1 (SIRT1), but data in human subjects are scarce. The

objective of this study was to examine the metabolic effects of

high-dose resveratrol in obese human subjects. In a randomized,

placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and parallel-group design,

24 obese but otherwise healthy men were randomly assigned to

4 weeks of resveratrol or placebo treatment. Extensive metabolic

examinations including assessment of glucose turnover and

insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) were

performed before and after the treatment. Insulin sensitivity, the

primary outcome measure, deteriorated insignificantly in both

groups. Endogenous glucose production and the turnover and

oxidation rates of glucose remained unchanged. 

Resveratrol supplementation also  **had no effect on** 

* blood pressure; 

* resting energy expenditure; 

* oxidation rates of lipid; 

* ectopic or visceral fat content; or 

* inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers. 

The lack of effect disagrees with persuasive data obtained from rodent models

and raises doubt about the justification of resveratrol as a

human nutritional supplement in metabolic disorders.

 **Note: The study only  150 mg resveratrol daily for only  30 days in a double-blind crossover design**
