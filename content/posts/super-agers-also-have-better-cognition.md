#### A Peek Inside the Brains of ‘Super-Agers’ - New York Times May 2024

* "A paper published Monday in the Journal of Neuroscience helps shed light on what’s so special about the brains of super-agers. The biggest takeaway, in combination with a companion study that came out last year on the same group of individuals, is that their  **brains have less atrophy**  than their peers’ do."

* "Most notably, the super-agers had slightly better physical health, both in terms of blood pressure and glucose metabolism, and they performed better on a test of mobility. The super-agers didn’t report doing more exercise at their current age than the typical older adults, but they were more active in middle age. They also reported better mental health."

##### Reporting on: Superagers resist typical age-related white matter structural changes

*&quot;A paper published Monday in the Journal of Neuroscience helps shed light on what’s so special about the brains of super-agers. The biggest takeaway, in combination with a companion study that came out last year on the same group of individuals, is that their __brains have less atrophy__ than their peers’ do.&quot;
