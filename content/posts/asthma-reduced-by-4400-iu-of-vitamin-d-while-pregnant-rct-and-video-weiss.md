#### Lessons Learned from an RCT on Prenatal Vitamin D and Asthma - interview Feb 2025

 **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGpvVvJuGHE)** 

##### Summary by GLASP AI

* (00:00-01:34) Dr. Scott Weiss, a Harvard Medical School professor and top biomedical researcher, began studying vitamin D's role in asthma after identifying the vitamin D receptor gene's link to childhood asthma through genetic and observational studies.

* (03:07-04:26) Vitamin D has both endocrine effects 

   * (bone health, measured through serum levels) and developmental effects 

   * (immune system, organ development, measured in tissue levels). 

   * It plays a crucial role throughout pregnancy, from implantation to postnatal immune function.

* (04:26-08:49) The VDART trial enrolled pregnant women *(10-18 weeks gestation) at high risk for having asthmatic children, randomizing them to receive either 4,400 IU or 400 IU vitamin D daily. Results showed a 20% reduction in childhood asthma, with a p-value of 0.051.

* (13:09-15:13) The trial faced three main limitations: insufficient vitamin D dosing *(only 75% reached target levels), late pregnancy initiation, and the presence of vitamin D in both control and treatment groups at baseline. When these factors were accounted for through meta-analysis and stratification, the reduction in asthma risk increased to 50%.

* (27:32-29:08) Molecular and genetic evidence showed vitamin D influences fetal lung development by increasing sphingolipid levels, which are necessary for airway and immune system development. This provides mechanistic support for the clinical findings.

* (31:50-33:14) Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may be a significant contributor to health disparities, particularly affecting African-American communities. Current recommendations *(600 IU) are 

   * far below what experts like Dr. Weiss suggest *( **6,000 IU minimum** ).

* (34:34-38:16) Pregnancy creates a dramatically increased physiological need for vitamin D, with 5-20 times higher requirements than non-pregnant state, due to fetal development needs and immune system modulation.

* (38:57-41:03) Dr. Weiss's team conducted mouse studies to measure vitamin D levels in various tissues compared to serum levels, as tissue measurements aren't possible in living humans. This research aims to better understand the relationship between serum and tissue vitamin D levels.

* (41:41-44:11) Dr. Weiss advocates for using "totality of evidence" rather than relying solely on randomized controlled trials for medical guidelines. He notes that BMI significantly affects vitamin D's effectiveness - women with normal BMI at pregnancy start showed better outcomes than obese women.

* (46:28-49:22) For future trials, Dr. Weiss recommends: enrolling women  **earlier in pregnancy**  *(4-5 weeks vs. 10-18 weeks), using higher vitamin D doses *(6,000-8,000 IU vs. 4,400 IU), and ensuring greater baseline difference between control and treatment groups. He notes VDART's results likely apply to general population.

* (50:04-52:54) While a  **new randomized controlled trial would cost approximately $10-12 million** , Dr. Weiss considers this cost-effective given the potential lifetime savings from preventing pregnancy complications and childhood health issues.  **The main challenge is finding initial funding for such a study.**

#### Asthma reduced 60% by daily 4,400 IU of Vitamin D while pregnant – RCT Feb 2024

 **Association of Prenatal Maternal and Infant Vitamin D Supplementation with Offspring Asthma**

Rationale: The role and timing of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of asthma has not been fully elucidated.

Objective: To describe the association between prenatal and postnatal vitamin D with offspring asthma outcomes in participants of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial.

Methods: We classified 748 mother-offspring pairs into four groups based on the mother’s randomization to receive high-dose versus low-dose (4,400 IU vs. 400IU) vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and the offspring parent-reported high­dose versus low-dose (>400 IU vs. <400 IU) vitamin D supplementation as estimated by intake of vitamin D drops or infant formula. We used logistic regression to test the association of the four vitamin D exposure groups—“mother-low/infant-low (reference),” “mother-high/infant-high,” “mother-high/infant- low,” and “mother-low/infant-high”—with offspring asthma and/or recurrent wheeze at age 3 years, active asthma at age 6 years, and atopic asthma at age 6 years.

Results: The risk of asthma and/or recurrent wheeze at 3 years was lowest in the mother-high/infant-low group (adjusted odds ratio vs. mother-low/infant-low, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.88, P = 0.03). When stratifying by history of exclusive breastfeeding until age 4 months, the protective effect in the mother-high/infant-low group was seen only among exclusively breastfed infants (odds ratio vs. mother-low/infant-low, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.68; P = 0.02). We did not observe any significant associations with active or atopic asthma at age 6 years.

Conclusions: We observe that high-dose prenatal and low-dose postnatal vitamin D supplementation may be associated with reduced offspring asthma or recurrent wheeze by age 3 years, but this association may be confounded by the protective effect of breastfeeding.
