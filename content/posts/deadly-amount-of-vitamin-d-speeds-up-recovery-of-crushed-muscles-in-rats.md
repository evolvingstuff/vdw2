Insufficient skeletal muscle regeneration after injury often impedes the healing process and is accompanied by functional deficiencies or pain. The aim of our study was to provide evidence that vitamin D improves muscle healing after muscle injury. Therefore, we used male rats and induced an injury of the soleus muscle. After crush injury, animals received either 8.3 mg/kg (332,000 IU/kg) body weight vitamin D or vehicle solution, s.c. After assessment of muscle force at days 1, 4, 14, and 42 after injury, sampling of muscle tissue served for analysis of proliferation (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine IHC), apoptosis (ApopTag kit), satellite cells (paired-box protein 7 IHC), and prolyl-4-hydroxylase-β expression (Western blot analysis). Vitamin D application caused a significant increase in cell proliferation and a significant inhibition of apoptosis at day 4 after injury compared to control animals. The numbers of satellite cells were not influenced by the vitamin D application, but there was an increase in prolyl-4-hydroxylase-β expression, indicative of increased extracellular matrix proteins. This cellular turnover resulted in a faster recovery of contraction forces at day 42 in the vitamin D group. Current data support the hypothesis that vitamin D promotes the regenerative process in injured muscle. Thus, vitamin D treatment may represent a promising therapy to optimize recovery after injury.
