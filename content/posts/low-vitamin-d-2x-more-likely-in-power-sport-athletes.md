##### Possible reasons for low D in athletes

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in athletes. Increased utilisation and storage depletion may be key contributing factor. We found a higher prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy (deficiency/ insufficiency) in power than endurance sport athletes, which may be related to vitamin D utilisation and reserve in skeletal muscles.

##### Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in athletes. Increased utilisation and storage depletion may be an important contributing factor for the high prevalence of  **vitamin D inadequacy in power sport (65.4%) compared to endurance sport (32.9%) athletes** . Clinical feature of athletes at risk of vitamin D deficiency include: 

* (1) female athletes with amenorrhea, 

* (2) jumping sport athletes with a history of previous stress fracture, 

* (3) indoor sport athletes who require weight-maintenance, and 

* (4) collegiate athletes with busy schedules. 

Ideally, serum 25(OH)D level should be assessed at least twice yearly in any athletes screened ‘at-risk’ — once in the early spring for the nadir and once in the late summer for a peak level. Supplemental oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) may be tailored according to athlete’s serum 25(OH)D basal levels and predicted seasonal variation throughout a competitive sporting season. Prescription at doses higher than the official recommendations are acceptable from a safety perspective.
