   * "5.5 viral genera in each individual and these viruses included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, adenoviruses, anelloviruses, parvoviruses, and circoviruses."

   * "Whole-genome sequencing data of blood from 8,240 individuals without any clear infectious disease revealed 94 different viruses in 42% of the study participants."

   * "Contrary to common belief, harmful viruses may be in the minority compared to benign viruses in the human body."

   * "The study of the human virome lags so far behind the study of bacteria that we are only just now uncovering some of their most basic features. "

   * "Viruses in the blood? Check. Viruses on the skin? Check. Viruses in the lungs? Check. Viruses in the urine? Check. And so on"

   * "So the race is on to find those viruses in our viromes that have already figured out how to protect us from the bad guys, while leaving the good bacteria intact"

   * "Bacteriophages (or "phages") are viruses that infect and destroy specific bacteria. "

   * "Viral infections at a young age are important to ensure the proper development of our immune systems. In addition, the immune system is continuously stimulated by systemic viruses at low levels sufficient to develop resistance to other infections."

      * Wonder if vaccines and antibiotics restrict development of the immune system
