Interest in contemporary vitamin D research has been sparked in recent years, stemming from the identification of vitamin D receptors in virtually all cells as well as the enzymatic machinery necessary to produce its active form. Both epidemiological and in-vitro studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to enigmatic diseases including cardiovascular disease; however, a clear mechanistic link remains missing. This review highlights conclusions of observational studies, in-vitro experiments and randomized-controlled trials that aimed to link deficiency of the sunshine vitamin to one of the leading causes of death in the world, cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, putative mechanisms viewed from a novel perspective are also discussed.
