#### Thanks to Pfizer Vaccine, 3rd-Party Royalties to NIH Doubled to $127 Million in 2021

 **[The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/adam-andrzejewski-pfizer-vaccine-royalties-nih/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=c2384d76-1d1b-43f5-94b1-9888754ae9f6)** 

* "Open The Books found that over the past 12 years, $1.4 billion worth of those grants  **went back to NIH leadership and 2,400 NIH scientists in secret “third-party royalties”**  — royalties paid by pharmaceutical companies back to the NIH or its scientists who are credited as co-inventors of pharmaceutical products."

* "acting director of the NIH, “admitted that, yes,  **every single one of those 56,000 payments over the course of the last 12 years has the appearance of a conflict of interest** ,” 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Note: If 100 NIH employees equally shared the $127 million in 2021, each would have gotten $1.27 million in Pfizer royalties.   A truely  huge incentive to push for Pfizer vaccinations.</span>**
