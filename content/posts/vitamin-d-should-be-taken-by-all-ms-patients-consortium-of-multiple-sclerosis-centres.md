* "There is, therefore, little doubt that vitamin D provides a range of valuable health effects — effects of importance to everyone, but of particular importance to people with MS."

* 'Studies showed that children who have lower vitamin D levels more often develop MS as adults."

* "To really conclude that vitamin D impacts the disease, randomized prospective clinical trials are needed. One such trial, the VIDAMS study, is currently underway. The study explores if high-dose supplements — 5000 IU per day  . . . "

* 'The possible link between MS and vitamin D levels will also be discussed at the CMSC 2016 Annual Meeting in Maryland on June 1–4".2016
