Successful prevention of diabetes, smoking, etc has been proven many times

The cost of prevention is far less expensive than the cost of treatment

The quality of life is far better if problem is treated than prevented

Examples in article: 

1. Lifestyle modification reduced T1 Diabetes

1. Paying women to not smoke during pregnancy saved lots of health care costs

 **However** 

1. Insurance companies rarely pay for prevention

> The person may no longer be a customer when a health problem is avoided

   * This is not a problem outside of the US where there is a single payer - have the same customer for life

1. Doctors, drug companies, and hospitals get far less income from prevention than from treatment

1. The US FDA requires a more expensive proof for prevention vs treatment

> Rarely is the proof cost-effective for a single group to fund
