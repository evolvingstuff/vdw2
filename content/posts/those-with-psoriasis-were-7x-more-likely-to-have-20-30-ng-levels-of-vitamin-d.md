Psoriasis is a continuing, periodic, immune-mediated, fiery skin disease branded by hyper proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and accompanying with inflammatory cellular infiltrate in both dermis and epidermis. Immunomodulation could be an important effect of vitamin D in Psoriasis. This case-control study was designed to measure serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in patients with psoriasis and healthy controls and to find out clinical correlation, if any. Six hundred two (n = 602) subjects (285 cases and 317 controls) were taken for the study. Cases and controls were frequency matched with respect to age and gender. Various demographic and clinical details were taken using a questionnaire. Chemiluminescence Micro Particle Immunoassay was used to estimate serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels. The vitamin D deficiency in psoriasis patients was 60.0% vs. 17.5% in controls (P < 0.001) with mean vitamin D levels of 28.3 ± 13.9 ng/ml in psoriasis patient's vs. 37.9 ± 9.7 ng/ml in controls. Vitamin D deficiency was found to be associated with psoriasis independently of gender, age, smoking status, family history, hypertension, chronic medication, nail changes, duration of symptoms and severity of disease. Vitamin D levels were seven times lower in patients with Psoriasis as compared to controls. Reduced vitamin D levels are related to duration and clinical severity of the disease. Early detection of vitamin D deficiency and timely intervention could lead to better clinical outcome and improved quality of life in psoriasis patients.
