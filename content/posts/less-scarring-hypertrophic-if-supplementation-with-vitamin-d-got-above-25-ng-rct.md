   * Suspect that scarred skin also produces less vitamin D, so topical supplementation could be useful

#### Comments by founder of VitaminDWiki

* It is unfortunate that the abstract does not state how much vitamin D was given nor how much benefit resulted

* As of Sept 2018 the PDF is not available at Sci-Hub

* Probably the sooner the Vitamin D levels are raised, the less the scarring

* Based on many other dermatology studies, topical vitamin D or UV on the scar would probably help

* Probably > 40 ng would produce significantly less scarring than > 25 ng (as in this study)

BACKGROUND:

Although many different diseases have been reported with vitamin D deficiency, the authors failed to find any studies on the association of  **hypertrophic scarring (HS)**  in the literature.

OBJECTIVE:

The authors aimed to determine the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and HS and investigate the effect of replacement therapy on HS development in patients with vitamin D deficiency.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

Patients who presented to the authors' outpatient clinic with HS between 2013 and 2016 were included in the study. In the first stage, all the patients with HS complaints were assessed for vitamin D levels. In the second stage, 50 patients with a vitamin D level less than 25 ng/mL and a linear scar after at least 1 year of trauma were randomly divided into 3 groups. 

* Group 1: patients who did not accept any medical or surgical treatment; 

* Group 2: patients who were subjected to vitamin D replacement only; 

* Group 3: patients who underwent surgical excision and suturation after vitamin D replacement.

RESULTS:

A statistically significant correlation was found between HS and vitamin D levels (p < .05). 

A statistically significant decrease in scar width was observed in Group 3 (p < .05).

CONCLUSION:

Increasing vitamin D levels to above 25 ng/mL before scar revision and vitamin D deficiency in patients with HS may help reduce scar width.
