Aim? This study was performed to determine the effect of a single, large, intramuscular injection of vitamin D post-partum on glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in women with gestational diabetes.

Methods? Forty-five participants in a randomized controlled trial on gestational diabetes mellitus were divided into an intervention group and a control group. Only subjects in the intervention group received one intramuscular injection of  **300 000 IU of vitamin D3** . HbA1c, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, fasting insulin and blood glucose, C-peptide, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index, ?-cell function, insulin sensitivity and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index were measured at baseline and after 3 months of intervention.

Results? Approximately 80% of the mothers had a degree of vitamin D deficiency. Post-intervention, this was found in  **4.2 and 71.4%**  in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The medians of homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance indices before and after intervention were 0.6 and 0.5 (P = 0.7), respectively, in subjects in the intervention group, and 0.5 and 0.9 (P = 0.01) in subjects in the control group. The mean of the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index fell only in the control group (P = 0.008). In the control group, ?-cell function increased by ?8% (P = 0.01) and insulin sensitivity decreased after 3 months (P = 0.002). Post-intervention, the median C-peptide decreased in the intervention group and increased in the control group, but the change was significant only in the control group (P = 0.03).

Conclusions? A single injection of 300 000 IU of vitamin D3 achieves a 3-month serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D range of 50–80 nmol/l and is an  **efficient, effective and safe procedure**  for improving the vitamin status and indices of insulin resistance in mothers with gestational diabetes after delivery.

Background: During pregnancy and lactation outstanding changes occur in mother's vitamin D metabolism. This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of 300,000 IU vitamin D given intramuscularly on body status in new cases of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 

Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial with the follow-up period of 3 months. Totally 45 participants were randomly divided into intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). The IG received an IM injection of 300,000 IU of vitamin D, whereas CG did not. The glycosylated hemoglobin A1C (HBA1C), serum 25-OH-D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium and phosphorus were measured. 

Results: Forty five patients including 24 with the mean age of 30.7±6.2 years in the IG and 21 with the mean age of 29.5±4.0 years in the CG participated in the study. The median concentration of serum 25(OH)D3 in the IG was to 62.10 nmol/l after the intervention, showing an increase of around 158%, compared to before intervention (24.25 nmol/l) whereas the CG showed a decrease of around 4.5%. Of the patients, 79.2% of IG and 81.9% of CG suffered to some degree from vitamin D deficiency. 

These figures were 4.2% and 71.4% for the IG and CG, respectively after the intervention.For the IG, the PTH was significantly lower and Ca was significantly higher after the intervention. The serum Phosphorus before and after the intervention in each group or between the two groups was not significant. 

Conclusions: The single 300,000 IM dose of vitamin D is regarded as an effective and safe to promptly improve vitamin D status in GDM. [138902113840N1](http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial.aspx?TrialID=IRCT138902113840N1%20)

### Comments by VitaminDWiki

1. Did they use vitamin D2 or Vitamin D3?

1. This was a safety trial only – no indication if it helped or not 

1. Many other studies have found that Vitamin D given at least monthly before, during and after pregnancy had many benefits, including reduction of the possibility of gestational diabetes
