There are no previous studies of the association between prediagnostic serum vitamin D concentration and glioma. Vitamin D has immunosuppressive properties; as does glioma. It was, therefore, our hypothesis that elevated vitamin D concentration would increase glioma risk. We conducted a nested case-control study using specimens from the Janus Serum Bank cohort in Norway. Blood donors who were subsequently diagnosed with glioma (n = 592), between 1974 and 2007, were matched to donors without glioma (n = 1112) on date and age at blood collection and sex. We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, an indicator of vitamin D availability, using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Seasonally adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated for each control quintile of 25(OH)D using conditional logistic regression. Among men diagnosed with high grade glioma >56, we found a negative trend (P = .04). 

Men diagnosed = 56 showed a borderline positive trend (P = .08). High levels (>66 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D in men >56 were inversely related to high grade glioma from 

* =2 yr before diagnosis (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.91) to 

* =15 yr before diagnosis (OR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.38,0.96). 

Our findings are consistent long before glioma diagnosis and are therefore unlikely to reflect preclinical disease.

#### Glioblastoma probably fought by Vitamin D and Receptors - 2021

 **Anti-tumor effects of vitamin D in glioblastoma: mechanism and therapeutic implications** 

Lab Invest . 2021 Sep 9. [doi: 10.1038/s41374-021-00673-8](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-021-00673-8)

Glioma is the most prevalent primary brain tumor in adults among which glioblastoma is the most malignant and lethal subtype. Its common resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics calls for the development of alternative or concomitant treatment. Taking advantage of its endocrine function as a neurosteroid, vitamin D has become a target of interest to be used in conjunction with different chemotherapies. In this article, we review the mechanisms through which vitamin D and its analogs induce anti-tumor activity in glioblastoma, and the practical issues relevant to their potential application based on in vitro and in vivo studies. 

 **Vitamin D has largely been reported to promote cell cycle arrest and induce cell death to suppress tumor growth in glioblastoma.** 

 **Glioblastoma cells treated with vitamin D have also shown reduced migratory and invasive phenotypes, and reduced stemness.** 

It is worth noting that vitamin D analogs are able to produce similar inhibitory actions without causing adverse effects such as hypercalcemia in vivo. Upregulation of  **vitamin D receptors**  by vitamin D and its analogs may also play a role in enhancing its anti-tumor activity. Based on current findings and taking into consideration its potential cancer-protective effects, the clinical application of vitamin D in glioblastoma treatment and prevention will be discussed. With some study findings subject to controversy, further investigation is warranted to elucidate the mechanism of action of vitamin D and to evaluate relevant issues regarding its treatment efficacy and potential clinical application.
