BACKGROUND:

The aim of this study is to investigate whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> is associated with initial stroke severity and infarct volume, using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

METHODS:

We studied a total of 235 patients who were admitted within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset. Initial stroke severity was assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Infarct volume was measured using DWI. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses were used to test whether 25(OH) D represents an independent predictor of infarct volume and stroke severity (NIHSS score of ≥6).

RESULTS:

Among 235 study patients, the median age was 64 years (IQR 56-75 years), and 125 (53.2%) were women. In multivariable models adjusted for other significant risk factors, 25(OH) D levels in the lowest and second interquartiles were associated with an increased risk of a NIHSS≥6 (with highest 25 (OH) D quartile as reference) with odd ratios (OR)  **3.02** (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>:1.59-6.34) and 5.85(2.90-11.54). The median DWI infarct volumes for the serum 25(OH) D level quartiles (lowest to highest) were 12.35, 6.55, 2.44, and 1.59 ml. The median DWI infarct volume in the lowest serum 25(OH) D level quartile was larger than that in the other 3 quartiles (P<0.001). The median adjusted DWI infarct volume in the lowest serum 25(OH) D level quartile was statistically significantly larger than that in the other 3 quartiles (P<0.01).

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, reduced serum 25(OH) D levels in acute ischemic stroke are an early predictor of larger volumes of ischemic tissue and worse neurological deficit (assessed by the NIHSS).
