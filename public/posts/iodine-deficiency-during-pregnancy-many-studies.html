I personally don’t recommend for anyone to begin taking high dosages of iodine unless if they have been tested for an iodine deficiency. But it’s amazing how many patients I have spoken with who are told to take iodine without having had any testing at all. Plus, even if someone is deficient in iodine, I personally recommend starting with a low dosage, rather than 25 to 50 mg immediately. I start most of my patients who are iodine deficient with 3mg and then gradually increase the dosage. For some people I start with a lower dosage than this. And of course some people I don’t recommend iodine to at all.</a></li><li><a href=#90-of-pregnant-women-in-turkey-did-not-have-enough-iodine--even-with-salt-iodization--2016-iodine-status-of-pregnant-women-in-a-metropolitan-city-which-proved-to-be-an-iodine-sufficient-area-is-mandatory-salt-iodisation-enough-for-pregnant-women-gynecol-endocrinol-2016323188-92-doi-1031090951359020151101443httpsdoiorg1031090951359020151101443-behind-54-paywall-oral-e1-aydogan-mathyk-b2-aydogan-bi3-acıkgoz-as1-erenel-h2-celik-acıoglu-h4-anık-ilhan-g5-dane-b6-ozel-a6-tandogan-b7-cakar-e7-isci-h8-kayan-b8-aslan-h9-ekiz-a9-sancak-s10-celik-a11-yoldemir-t5-uzun-o5-erdogan-mf3>90% of pregnant women in Turkey did not have enough Iodine – even with salt Iodization – 2016** Iodine status of pregnant women in a metropolitan city which proved to be an iodine-sufficient area.

Pearce & Mario Rotondi</p><p>Iodine supplementation during pregnancy in areas with mild-moderate deficiency is still a matter of debate. The present study aimed at systematically reviewing currently available evidences provided by meta-analyses with the aim to further clarify controversial aspects regarding the need of iodine supplementation in pregnancy as well as to provide guidance on clinical decision-making, even in areas with mild-moderate deficiency. Medline, Embase and Cochrane search from 1969 to 2022 were performed. For the purpose of this review, only studies containing meta-analytic data were selected. A total of 7 meta-analyses were retrieved. Four meta-analyses evaluated the relationship between iodine status during pregnancy and neonatal and maternal outcomes suggesting the existence of a U-shaped correlation between iodine status and several maternal and neonatal consequences, especially if iodine status is evaluated at the beginning of pregnancy. Three meta-analyses evaluating the results of intervention trials failed to provide straightforward conclusions on the benefits of iodine supplementation in pregnant women in areas with mild-moderate iodine deficiency. Although evidence coming from meta-analyses suggests a role of iodine status during pregnancy in determining maternal and child outcomes, results of meta-analyses of intervention trials are still controversial. Several factors including, degree of iodine deficiency, and pooling studies conducted in areas with different iodine intake, may account for the lack of benefits reported by meta-analyses of intervention trials. More high-quality, randomized, controlled trials including information on timing, dose and regimen of iodine supplementation are needed to further elucidate this issue.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/iodine-pregnancy-meta-oct-2022-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=effects-of-iodine-supplementation-during-pregnancy-on-pregnant-women-and-their-offspring-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-trials-over-the-past-3-decades--jan-2021>Effects of iodine supplementation during pregnancy on pregnant women and their offspring: a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials over the past 3 decades Jan 2021</h4><p>European Journal of Endocrinology, Volume 184, Issue 1, Jan 2021, Pages 91–106, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1530/EJE-20-0927>FREEPDF</a></p><p>Pantea Nazeri, Mamak Shariat, Fereidoun Azizi</p><p>Objective</p><p>The current systematic review aimed to provide comprehensive data on the effects of iodine supplementation in pregnancy and investigate its potential benefits on infant growth parameters and neurocognitive development using meta-analysis.</p><p>Methods</p><p>A systematic review was conducted on trials published from January 1989 to December 2019 by searching MEDLINE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar.

We aimed to quantify the association between iodine status and birth outcomes, including potential threshold effects using nonlinear dose–response curves.</p><p>Methods: We systematically searched Medline and Embase to 10 October 2022 for relevant cohort studies. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses of urinary iodine concentration (UIC), iodine:creatinine ratio (I:Cr), and iodide intake for associations with birth weight, birth weight centile, small for gestational age (SGA), preterm delivery, and other birth outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.</p><p>Results: Meta-analyses were conducted on 23 cohorts with 42269 participants. Birth weight was similar between UIC ≥ 150 μg/L and &lt;150 μg/L (difference = 30 g, 95% CI −22 to 83, p = 0.3, n = 13, I2 = 89%) with no evidence of linear trend (4 g per 50 μg/L, −3 to 10, p = 0.2, n = 12, I2 = 80%). I:Cr was similar, but with nonlinear trend suggesting I:Cr up to 200 μg/g associated with increasing birthweight (p = 0.02, n = 5). Birthweight was 2.0 centiles (0.3 to 3.7, p = 0.02, n = 4, I2 = 0%) higher with UIC ≥ 150 μg/g, but not for I:Cr. UIC ≥ 150 μg/L was associated with lower risk of SGA (RR = 0.85, 0.75 to 0.96, p = 0.01, n = 13, I2 = 0%), but not with I:Cr.</p><p>Conclusions: The main risk of bias was adjustment for confounding, with variation in urine sample collection and exposure definition. There were modest-sized associations between some measures of iodine status, birth weight, birth weight centile, and SGA. In pregnancy, we recommend that future studies report standardised measures of birth weight that take account of gestational age, such as birth weight centile and SGA. Whilst associations were modest-sized, we recommend maintaining iodine sufficiency in the population, especially for women of childbearing age on restricted diets low in iodide.</p><hr><h4 id=make-sure-iodine-is-in-your-prenatal---dr-greger-aug-2019>Make Sure Iodine is in Your Prenatal - Dr. Greger Aug 2019</h4><p><strong><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/2019/08/06/make-sure-iodine-is-in-your-prenatal/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&amp;utm_campaign=7403cc67fb-RSS_BLOG_DAILY&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-7403cc67fb-25209481&amp;mc_cid=7403cc67fb&amp;mc_eid=b95641625a">Make Sure Iodine is in Your Prenatal</a></strong> also has 5 minute video with transcript <a href=https://nutritionfacts.org/video/iodine-supplements-before-during-and-after-pregnancy/>Iodine Supplements Before, During, and After Pregnancy</a> 2016 **&mdash;</p><h4 id=iodine-and-pregancy-book---2014>Iodine and Pregancy book - 2014</h4><p><a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Preventing-Birth-Defects-Understanding-Connection/dp/0982827644/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443357331&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=eugene+heyden%20">Preventing Birth Defects: Understanding the Iodine/Thyroid Hormone Connection</a></p><p>Nice book.

A reduced intelligence quotient (IQ) score has broad economic and societal cost implications because intelligence affects wellbeing, income, and education outcomes. Although pregnancy and lactation lead to increased iodine needs, no UK recommendations for iodine supplementation have been issued to pregnant women. We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of iodine supplementation versus no supplementation for pregnant women in a mildly to moderately iodine-deficient population for which a population-based iodine supplementation programme-for example, universal salt iodisation-did not exist.</p><p>METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit, and NHS EED for economic studies that linked IQ and income published in all languages until Aug 21, 2014. We took clinical data relating to iodine deficiency in pregnant women and the effect on IQ in their children aged 8-9 years from primary research. A decision tree was developed to compare the treatment strategies of iodine supplementation in tablet form with no iodine supplementation for pregnant women in the UK. Analyses were done from a health service perspective (analysis 1; taking direct health service costs into account) and societal perspective (analysis 2; taking education costs and the value of an IQ point itself into account), and presented in terms of cost (in sterling, relevant to 2013) per IQ point gained in the offspring. We made data-supported assumptions to complete these analyses, but used a conservative approach that limited the benefits of iodine supplementation and overestimated its potential harms.</p><p>FINDINGS: Our systematic search identified 1361 published articles, of which eight were assessed to calculate the monetary value of an IQ point. A discounted lifetime value of an additional IQ point based on earnings was estimated to be £3297 (study estimates range from £1319 to £11 967) for the offspring cohort. Iodine supplementation was cost saving from both a health service perspective (saving £199 per pregnant woman <span>[sensitivity analysis range -£42 to £229]</span>) and societal perspective (saving £4476 per pregnant woman <span>[sensitivity analysis range £540 to £4495]</span>), with a net gain of 1·22 IQ points in each analysis. Base case results were robust to sensitivity analyses.</p><p>INTERPRETATION: Iodine supplementation for pregnant women in the UK is potentially cost saving. This finding also has implications for the 1·88 billion people in the 32 countries with iodine deficiency worldwide. Valuation of IQ points should consider non-earnings benefits-eg, health benefits associated with a higher IQ not germane to earnings.</p><p>PMID: 26268911** <a href=http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/landia/PIIS2213-8587(15)00212-0.pdf>Publisher wants $31 for the PDF</a> **&mdash;</p><h4 id=the-importance-of-adequate-iodine-during-pregnancy-and-infancy---zimmerman-dec-2016>The Importance of Adequate Iodine during Pregnancy and Infancy - Zimmerman Dec 2016</h4><p><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27198746>Zimmerman</a></p><p>Iodine requirements are increased ≥50% during pregnancy.

Because iodine deficiency (ID) in pregnancy may be associated with neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring, a pertinent question is at what level of iodine intake pregnant women should be advised to take iodine-containing supplements. The consensus reached by the WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD in 2007 was that pregnant women should not be recommended to take iodine-containing supplements if the population in general had been iodine sufficient for at least 2 years. However, guidance on this differs between scientific societies. This review discusses iodine supplementation in pregnancy. Based on current evidence, the recommendations given by WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD in 2007 provide a valid guidance on the use of iodine supplements in pregnant women. Women living in a population with a median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) at or above 100 µg/l are not in need of iodine supplementation in pregnancy. On the other hand, if the population median UIC is below 100 µg/l, pregnant women should take iodine-containing supplements until the population in general has been iodine sufficient for at least 2 years by way of universal salt iodization.** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/iodine-supplementation-in-pregnancy-and-the-dilemma-of-ambiguous-recommendations.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> **&mdash;</p><h4 id=iodine-supplementation-in-pregnancy---is-it-time---july-2016>Iodine supplementation in pregnancy - is it time? - July 2016</h4><p>Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2016 Jul;85(1):10-4. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.13065>doi: 10.1111/cen.13065</a></p><p>Taylor PN1, Vaidya B2.</p><p>Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone and optimal foetal neurological development. Pregnant women living in borderline or moderate-severe iodine deficient areas are at particularly high risk of being iodine deficient, and this may have important clinical consequences, particularly for the neurocognitive development of the offspring. It is a substantial problem and many countries including the United Kingdom are mild-moderately iodine deficient. Although the detrimental effects of severe iodine deficiency are well recognized, the benefits of correcting mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency are unclear due to a lack of randomized controlled trials in this area. However, observational data increasingly indicate that there may be substantial health and economic benefits from correcting iodine deficiency in pregnancy. There is now a growing trend from learned societies that iodine supplementation should be utilized in pregnancy in countries with mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency. The dose of iodine supplement needs to reflect local iodine status and iodization policies and will need careful monitoring at the population level to ensure doses to prevent under/excess dosing which would undermine the potential benefits. National tailored guidance is therefore essential.</p><hr><h4 id=maternal-iodine-insufficiency-and-adverse-pregnancy-outcomes---oct-2016>Maternal iodine insufficiency and adverse pregnancy outcomes - Oct 2016</h4><p>Matern Child Nutr. 2016 Oct;12(4):680-7. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.12211>doi: 10.1111/mcn.12211</a></p><p>Charoenratana C1, Leelapat P2, Traisrisilp K1, Tongsong T3.</p><p>This study aimed to assess the iodine status of pregnant women in each trimester and to compare the pregnancy outcomes between groups with iodine insufficiency and iodine sufficiency.

I personally don’t recommend for anyone to begin taking high dosages of iodine unless if they have been tested for an iodine deficiency. But it’s amazing how many patients I have spoken with who are told to take iodine without having had any testing at all. Plus, even if someone is deficient in iodine, I personally recommend starting with a low dosage, rather than 25 to 50 mg immediately. I start most of my patients who are iodine deficient with 3mg and then gradually increase the dosage. For some people I start with a lower dosage than this. And of course some people I don’t recommend iodine to at all.</h4><p>There are numerous ways to test for an iodine deficiency, and below I will discuss four different methods of iodine testing:** Iodine Testing Method #1 <strong>: One sample urine test. This is the urine test typically performed by most medical doctors to determine the levels of iodine. While this isn’t a completely useless test, it isn’t as accurate as the iodine loading test, which is described below.</strong> Iodine Testing Method #2: Blood test <strong>This seems to be an accurate way to test the iodine levels, but the problem is that most labs don’t do such testing.</strong> Iodine Testing Method #3: Iodine Patch Test. **This is a general test which can help determine whether someone is deficient in iodine. It involves drawing a 2 x 2 patch on your forearm using a 2% tincture of iodine. For someone who isn’t iodine deficient, the patch shouldn’t begin to fade until after 24 hours. Someone who is deficient in iodine will see the patch disappear in a shorter amount of time. Those with a severe iodine deficiency will see the patch begin to fade or disappear completely in 12 hours or less.</p><p>Once again, this isn’t the most accurate test (although it definitely is the least expensive of the four). Even though it isn’t accurate, it can help to give a general idea as to whether someone is deficient in iodine, and if they will need to supplement with iodine. However, I think 24 hours is a random number, and I feel that 12 to 14 hours is more accurate in determining how long the iodine should last before fading significantly. While someone can start off with this test, eventually it is recommended that they receive an iodine loading test to get a more specific reading.** Iodine Testing Method #4: Iodine Loading Test. **This test measures the excretion of iodine over a 24-hour period. It admittedly isn’t the most convenient test, as you need to collect EVERY urine sample within a 24-hour period. Before this test you need to take a 50 mg tablet of iodine. Although taking such a high dosage on a regular basis without prior testing isn’t recommended, taking it one time shouldn’t cause problems with most people. This usually includes people with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis. However, many people with Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis are still cautious about taking this test due to the ingestion of iodine, which is fine, as they can always choose one of the other tests if they’re really concerned about any negative effects of taking the iodine.</p><p>Ideally someone who has a sufficient amount of iodine should excrete at least 90% of the iodine over a 24-hour period. If it is less than this then the person has an iodine deficiency. The lower the excretion rate, the greater the iodine deficiency.** How Much Iodine Should One Take? **If it’s determined that someone is iodine deficient, then how much iodine should that person take? There are different opinions regarding this, but as I mentioned earlier, what I do is put someone on a low dosage of iodine (3mg), and then gradually increase the dosage each week, and will eventually retest. If the person begins with an iodine patch test, they of course can easily retest every 2 to 4 weeks, although one needs to keep in mind that it usually takes at least a few months to correct such a deficiency, and for someone with a moderate to a severe deficiency it can take a long time to accomplish this. For those who don’t obtain an Iodine Loading test right away, I definitely recommend obtaining this test after three to six months after beginning to supplement with iodine.</p><p>Different doctors will of course have different approaches, as some will recommend starting with large dosages of iodine, and others like myself will suggest taking it slowly. While many people have no problem taking large dosages of iodine immediately, others are not able to tolerate larger dosages. And there really is no way to predict how someone will respond, which is why I like to play it safe and start someone with a lower dosage.</p><p>In summary, before anyone supplements with iodine I recommend for them to obtain at least one of the above tests I mentioned. I also recommend that people begin with a low dosage of iodine, and then gradually increase the dosage. And when someone does begin an iodine supplementation program, it is important to retest after a few months in order to make sure they are taking a sufficient amount of iodine on a daily basis.</p><h4 id=90-of-pregnant-women-in-turkey-did-not-have-enough-iodine--even-with-salt-iodization--2016-iodine-status-of-pregnant-women-in-a-metropolitan-city-which-proved-to-be-an-iodine-sufficient-area-is-mandatory-salt-iodisation-enough-for-pregnant-women-gynecol-endocrinol-2016323188-92-doi-1031090951359020151101443httpsdoiorg1031090951359020151101443-behind-54-paywall-oral-e1-aydogan-mathyk-b2-aydogan-bi3-acıkgoz-as1-erenel-h2-celik-acıoglu-h4-anık-ilhan-g5-dane-b6-ozel-a6-tandogan-b7-cakar-e7-isci-h8-kayan-b8-aslan-h9-ekiz-a9-sancak-s10-celik-a11-yoldemir-t5-uzun-o5-erdogan-mf3>90% of pregnant women in Turkey did not have enough Iodine – even with salt Iodization – 2016** Iodine status of pregnant women in a metropolitan city which proved to be an iodine-sufficient area.

Age, gestational weeks, smoking, consumption of iodized salt, dietary salt restriction, history of stillbirth, abortus and congenital malformations were questioned. Spot urine samples were analyzed for urine iodine concentration (UIC). The outcomes were: (a) median UIC in three trimesters of pregnancy and (b) frequency of ID among pregnant women. The median UIC was 73 µg/L. The median UIC was 77 µg/L (1-324), 73 µg/L (1-600) and 70 µg/L (1-1650) in three trimesters of pregnancy, respectively (p: 0.14).

A reduced intelligence quotient (IQ) score has broad economic and societal cost implications because intelligence affects wellbeing, income, and education outcomes. Although pregnancy and lactation lead to increased iodine needs, no UK recommendations for iodine supplementation have been issued to pregnant women. We aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of iodine supplementation versus no supplementation for pregnant women in a mildly to moderately iodine-deficient population for which a population-based iodine supplementation programme- -for example, universal salt iodisation- -did not exist.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit, and NHS EED for economic studies that linked IQ and income published in all languages until Aug 21, 2014. We took clinical data relating to iodine deficiency in pregnant women and the effect on IQ in their children aged 8-9 years from primary research. A decision tree was developed to compare the treatment strategies of iodine supplementation in tablet form with no iodine supplementation for pregnant women in the UK. Analyses were done from a health service perspective (analysis 1; taking direct health service costs into account) and societal perspective (analysis 2; taking education costs and the value of an IQ point itself into account), and presented in terms of cost (in sterling, relevant to 2013) per IQ point gained in the offspring. We made data-supported assumptions to complete these analyses, but used a conservative approach that limited the benefits of iodine supplementation and overestimated its potential harms.</p><p>FINDINGS:</p><p>Our systematic search identified** 1361 published articles **, of which eight were assessed to calculate the monetary value of an IQ point. A discounted lifetime value of an additional IQ point based on earnings was estimated to be £3297 (study estimates range from £1319 to £11,967) for the offspring cohort. Iodine supplementation was cost saving from both a health service perspective (saving £199 per pregnant woman <span>[sensitivity analysis range -£42 to £229]</span>) and societal perspective (saving £4476 per pregnant woman <span>[sensitivity analysis range £540 to £4495]</span>), with a net gain of 1·22 IQ points in each analysis. Base case results were robust to sensitivity analyses.</p><p>INTERPRETATION:</p><p>Iodine supplementation for pregnant women in the UK is potentially cost saving. This finding also has implications for the 1·88 billion people in the 32 countries with iodine deficiency worldwide. Valuation of IQ points should consider non-earnings benefits- -eg, health benefits associated with a higher IQ not germane to earnings.</p><p>PMID: 26268911 DOI: 10.1016/S2213-8587(15)00212-0** PDF is behind $31.50 paywall **&mdash;</p><h4 id=only-12-of-uk-pregnant-women-knew-of-the-iodine-recommendations--2015-iodine-and-pregnancy---a-uk-cross-sectional-survey-of-dietary-intake-knowledge-and-awareness-br-j-nutr-2015-jul-141141108-17-doi-101017s0007114515001464httpsdoiorg101017s0007114515001464-epub-2015-may-26>Only 12% of UK pregnant women knew of the Iodine recommendations – 2015** Iodine and pregnancy - a UK cross-sectional survey of dietary intake, knowledge and awareness. **Br J Nutr. 2015 Jul 14;114(1):108-17. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114515001464.>doi: 10.1017/S0007114515001464.</a> Epub 2015 May 26.</h4><p>Combet E1, Bouga M1, Pan B1, Lean ME1, Christopher CO1.</p><p>1Department of Human Nutrition,School of Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow,New Lister Building, Alexandra Parade,GlasgowG31 2ER,UK.</p><p>Iodine is a key component of the thyroid hormones, which are critical for healthy growth, development and metabolism.

Adequate levels of iodine during pregnancy are essential for fetal neurodevelopment, and mild iodine deficiency is linked to developmental impairments. In the absence of prophylaxis in the UK, awareness of nutritional recommendations during pregnancy would empower mothers to make the right dietary choices leading to adequate iodine intake. The present study aimed to: estimate mothers&rsquo; dietary iodine intake in pregnancy (using a FFQ); assess awareness of the importance of iodine in pregnancy with an understanding of existing pregnancy dietary and lifestyle recommendations with relevance for iodine; examine the level of confidence in meeting adequate iodine intake. A cross-sectional survey was conducted and questionnaires were distributed between August 2011 and February 2012 on local (Glasgow) and national levels (online electronic questionnaire); 1026 women, UK-resident and pregnant or mother to a child aged up to 36 months participated in the study.

Women who are pregnant and lactating require increased iodine intake. Unfortunately, median iodine levels in the United States have decreased by 50% in the past 3 decades, with recent studies demonstrating that pregnant women are mildly iodine deficient. Nevertheless, data from the NHANES 1999–2006 showed that only 22% of US pregnant women take an iodine-containing dietary supplement.1 Even mild iodine deficiency has been associated with adverse effects.

Universal salt iodization is the first-line strategy for the elimination of severe iodine deficiency. Iodine supplementation is recommended for vulnerable groups in severely iodine-deficient regions where salt iodization is infeasible or insufficient. A recent clinical trial has informed best practices for iodine supplementation of severely iodine-deficient lactating mothers. Because of successful programs of universal salt iodization in formerly severely iodine-deficient regions around the world, public health concern has shifted toward mild to moderate iodine deficiency, which remains prevalent in many regions, especially among pregnant women. Observational studies have shown associations between both mild maternal iodine deficiency and mild maternal thyroid hypofunction and decreased child cognition. Iodine supplementation has been shown to improve indexes of maternal thyroid function, even in marginally iodine-deficient areas. However, no data are yet available from randomized controlled trials in regions of mild to moderate iodine insufficiency on the relation between maternal iodine supplementation and neurobehavioral development in the offspring; thus, the long-term benefits and safety of such supplementation are uncertain. Although it is clear that excessive iodine intake can cause alterations in thyroid function in susceptible individuals, safe upper limits for iodine intake in pregnancy have not been well defined. Well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled trials that examine the effects of iodine supplementation on maternal thyroid function and infant neurobehavioral development in mildly to moderately iodine-deficient pregnant women are urgently needed. In addition, clinical data on the effects of iodine excess in pregnant and lactating women are needed to inform current recommendations for safe upper limits on chronic iodine ingestion in general and on iodine supplementation in particular.** Publisher wants $25 for the PDF__</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/breastfed.html><span class=tag>breastfed</span></a>
