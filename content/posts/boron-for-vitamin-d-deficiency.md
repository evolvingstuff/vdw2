#### HOW BORON CAN HELP

Research, consisting of both animal and human studies, has revealed the [beneficial role of boron in increasing the serum levels of Vitamin D](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=J%20Trace%20Elem%20Exp%20Med&title=Effect%20of%20boron%20depletion%20and%20repletion%20on%20blood%20indicators%20of%20calcium%20status%20in%20humans%20fed%20a%20magnesium-low%20diet&author=FH%20Nielsen&author=LM%20Mullen&author=SK%20Gallegher&volume=3&publication_year=1990&pages=45-54&). The underlying mechanism appears multifaceted. One plausible explanation suggests that boron aids in retaining and efficiently utilizing magnesium and copper, minerals essential for various bodily functions. Specifically, boron is known to keep magnesium within the cell, preventing rapid depletion of our magnesium reserves, particularly pertinent during stress response. Concurrently, copper—an indispensable mineral for cellular energy generation—may also be conserved better as boron supplementation can prevent the over-consumption of critical nutrients, like copper, during increased stress.One pioneering open pilot study recorded similar findings. This study involved middle-aged participants presumed to be Vitamin D deficient. 

Researchers monitored Vitamin D levels during a 60-day supplementation of boron (6mg per day), specifically during autumn transitioning to winter, a period typically associated with decreased sunlight. The results showed a [ **considerable average increase of about 20% in Vitamin D levels** ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15504575/) during boron supplementation.Boron, a mineral often overlooked, has been found to have a potentially significant impact on the body's levels of Vitamin D. But that's not all – it turns out boron also plays a role in our endocrine systems. Studies have shown that higher dietary boron intake can increase the half-life of certain steroid hormones like estrogen and testosterone, leading some to theorize that it may have similar effects on Vitamin D. This could be particularly relevant for those struggling with osteoarthritis, as studies have suggested that adequate Vitamin D levels may be necessary for maintaining healthy bones and reducing inflammation.

While more research is needed to understand this connection fully, it's clear that Boron deserves a closer look when it comes to supporting overall health and wellness. Adding weight to this argument, Milijkovic et al. suggested that [boron might suppress 24-hydroxylase's activity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15504575/)—an enzyme principally involved in Vitamin D3 catabolism. If true, this would mean **boron could help maintain higher levels of Vitamin D by limiting the breakdown of the hormone itself** . The interplay of these mechanisms underscores the multifaceted nature of boron's role in supporting Vitamin D levels, making it a valuable nutrient in combating Vitamin D deficiency.They stated: Boron readily forms covalent complexes with cis-vicinal dihydroxy compounds. Thus, it is conceivable that it can form such a complex with 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the end product of the reaction of 25(OH)D3 with 24-hydroxylase. This postulated complex might either act as a competitive inhibitor of the 24-hydroxylase reaction, or alternatively, perhaps could act to down-regulate expression of the enzyme. Another possibility is that boron is a direct inhibitor of the enzyme at very modest concentrations; indeed, boron can inhibit numerous enzymes …

#### THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BORON AND VITAMIN D

The advantageous hormonal effects of boron are likely attributable to its more comprehensive influence on the hydroxylation of various steroid compounds. This multifaceted impact on hydroxylation processes underscores the significance of boron in supporting hormonal balance.The surge in popularity of vitamin D supplementation since 2020 raises questions about the overall nutrient status of individuals who are considering taking it. It is essential to understand that Vitamin D is not just a simple vitamin. It is a hormone that undergoes several downstream processes before it is synthesized in the body. Hormonal imbalances usually indicate deeper underlying problems, such as mineral imbalances that can lead to birth defects, oxidation, and even arthritis. Therefore, it is essential to consider foundational mineral imbalances before addressing hormonal imbalances. One such mineral that has shown promise in restoring hormonal balance is chromium, which has been studied in a clinical trial setting. By addressing these underlying mineral imbalances, individuals can pave the way for optimal health and well-being.

#### CONCLUSION

In conclusion, while Vitamin D is essential for overall health, many individuals who face deficiency might consider boron supplementation to help improve their vitamin D levels. Boron has been shown to increase serum levels of vitamin D in various studies and has beneficial effects on the endocrine system. Before supplementing with vitamin D alone, addressing any nutrient imbalances that may contribute to deficiencies is crucial. By understanding the importance of minerals like boron in the proper synthesis and function of vitamin D, you can take proactive steps towards better health while addressing the root cause of deficiencies. Consider testing your mineral status and consulting a healthcare professional or nutrition coach to identify any underlying imbalances and develop an appropriate plan for supplementation.
