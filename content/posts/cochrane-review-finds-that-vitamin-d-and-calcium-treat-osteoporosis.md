## Calcium and vitamin D for treating osteoporosis caused by the use of steroids

Corticosteroids are widely used to treat inflammation. Bone loss (osteoporosis) is a serious side effect of this therapy. 

We reviewed a total of 5 trials which included 742 patients. 

We found that after two years of treatment, the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and forearm of patients taking calcium and vitamin D therapy improved more than patients who had no treatment. 

There was no difference in the number of fractures or laboratory measures of bone density between the two groups. 

 **We found that calcium and vitamin D is effective at preventing and treating corticosteroid-induced bone loss at the lumbar spine and forearm. The treatment appears to be safe.**
