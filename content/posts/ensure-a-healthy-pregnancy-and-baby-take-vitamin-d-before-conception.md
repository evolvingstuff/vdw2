 **Note:** 

Clinical trials adding vitamin D at 20 weeks [have found little benefit](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1800927) 2018

Most trials now add vitamin D around 10 weeks

Very little reduction in miscarriage, Autism if add Vitmin D at 10 weeks

Loading dose at 4 weeks could greatly reduce miscarriage

Starting Vitamin D 11 weeks before will increase conception by 3 X

#### Response time is typically 11 weeks

#### The Role of Vitamin D in Fertility and during Pregnancy and Lactation : A Review of Clinical Data - Oct 2018

* "In pregnancy, however, it should be considered that cord blood 25(OH)D concentrations are only about 50 to 80% of serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Therefore, it could be hypothesized, that the mother may need more 25(OH)D during pregnancy in order to transfer enough 25(OH)D to the fetus"

* "Therefore, to provide sufficient vitamin D content in breast milk for the infant, the vitamin D intake of the mother during lactation has to be much higher compared to the intake during pregnancy as at birth, serum 25(OH)D concentrations in cord blood are about 50 to 80% of serum 25(OH)D concentrations of the mother "

* Very conservative conclusion based on a lack of data and poor target goal. Pregnant women should take 800-1000 IU of vitamin D to maintain > 20 ng level of vitamin D.
