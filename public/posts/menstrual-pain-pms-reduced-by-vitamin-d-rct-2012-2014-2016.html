It is frequently accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, asthenia, and insomnia.1 - 2 Primary dysmenorrhea affects almost half of menstruating women, often resulting in school and work absenteeism with major educational and economic consequences.2</p><p>An excessive uterine production of prostaglandins (PGs) is the pathogenetic trigger of dysmenorrhea. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the currently accepted drugs for the management of this disorder.1 - 2</p><p>Because the vitamin D receptor is widespread and the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25<span>[OH]</span>D)-1?-hydroxylase (1?-OHase), which catalyzes the synthesis of 1?,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D) from its precursor 25(OH)D, is expressed in the human uterus and in immune system cells, and because vitamin D reduces the synthesis of PGs, a beneficial effect of vitamin D in the uterus pathophysiology is possible.3 - 4</p><p>The aim of this prospective intervention study was to evaluate the effect of a single-loading oral dose of cholecalciferol ( <strong>300 000 IU</strong> ) on primary dysmenorrhea.</p><p>METHODS</p><p>Forty women aged 18 to 40 years, attending the outpatient clinics of the Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Messina, Messina, Italy, for primary dysmenorrhea were enrolled. Patients were included if (1) their menstrual cycles lasted 21 to 35 days, with menstruation lasting 3 to 7 days; (2) they experienced at least 4 consecutive painful periods in the past 6 months with the pain starting one day before or on the day of onset of bleeding; (3) they showed a 25(OH)D serum level, measured with high-performance liquid chromatography, below the upper limit of the lowest quartile (&lt;45 ng/mL) (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496) obtained by dividing the normal range of our laboratory (20-120 ng/mL) into 4 parts. Patients had to be in good health and taking no medications including calcium, vitamin D, and oral contraceptives. Previous and current use of intrauterine contraceptive devices within the 6 months prior to enrollment was not permitted. During the observation period, patients used an accepted means of birth control. Use of NSAIDs was permitted and it had to be recorded in a sheet given to each woman.</p><p>Women were randomized into 2 groups: 20 women received a single oral dose of cholecalciferol (300 000 IU/1 mL <span>[Abiogen Pharma S.P.A.]</span>) 5 days before the putative beginning of their next menstrual cycle, while another 20 women received placebo.</p><p>The primary outcome was the intensity of menstrual pain as measured by a <strong>visual analog scale</strong> . The secondary outcome was use of NSAIDs during the 2-month duration of the study. The study was performed between October 2009 and May 2010 according to the Principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each woman.</p><p>Comparisons between groups were performed by the unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney test, and within-group comparisons were determined with the paired t test or Wilcoxon matched paired rank sum test for paired data, as appropriate. The Fisher exact test was used to calculate differences in the proportion of categorical variables. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the correlation between 2 variables. P &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>The 2 groups did not differ significantly in age, body mass index, severity of pain, and 25(OH)D levels at baseline. There was a negative correlation between the pain score at baseline and the levels of 25(OH)D (r = ?0.36; P = .02). We observed a significant reduction of pain in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group (P &lt; .001) over the 2-month duration of our study (Figure). The greatest reduction of pain score was seen in women with severe pain at baseline in vitamin D group (r = ?0.76; P &lt; .001).</p><p>We recorded <strong>no NSAID use in vitamin D group</strong> at 1 and 2 months, while <strong>40% of women in placebo group took NSAIDs at least once</strong> (P = .003).</p><p>Figure.

Eligible women reported intensity of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline and then at the end of the first and second month after the dose of placebo or vitamin D. The filled circles in the right panels represent individual changes.

Manson, MD, DrPH</p><p>Arch Intern Med. 2012;172(4):367-369. doi:10.1001/archinte.172.4.367</p><p>Primary dysmenorrhea is among the most common menstrual disorders, occurring in at least 50% of reproductive-age women.1 Dysmenorrhea is characterized by pelvic pain beginning shortly before the onset of menses or at the beginning of menstrual flow and then lasting several days. The disorder results in substantial impairment in normal functioning and is among the most common causes of school and work absenteeism in young women. The main source of pelvic pain is believed to be prostaglandins synthesized from omega-6 fatty acids prior to menses, which control vasoconstriction and uterine contraction. Though nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptives are effective at managing pain in many patients, these medications are not without risks. Given the high prevalence of dysmenorrhea and the long duration over which affected women may suffer, treatment options with fewer adverse effects are needed.</p><p>In this issue, Lasco and colleagues2 report findings from a small randomized trial of the effect of high-dose vitamin D therapy on pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea. Forty women seeking treatment were randomized to receive either a single oral dose of 300 000 IU of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) (n = 20) or a placebo (n = 20), given 5 days before the expected start of their next menstrual period. After 2 months, mean pain scores had decreased 41% from baseline levels among women assigned to vitamin D treatment, while no difference was observed among women assigned to placebo (P &lt; .001). The largest benefits were observed among women reporting the highest pain scores at baseline. Furthermore, women assigned to vitamin D reported no use of NSAIDs to manage pain during the 2-month follow-up period, while 40% of the women assigned to placebo reported NSAID use at least once (P = .003).</p><p>While the effect of vitamin D on dysmenorrhea has not been evaluated previously, a small number of studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in other menstrual and pain-related conditions in women, including</p><ul><li><p>premenstrual syndrome (PMS),</p></li><li><p>fibromyalgia, and</p></li><li><p>endometriosis.</p></li></ul><p>Low dietary vitamin D intake was associated with the initial development of moderate to severe PMS in a substudy within the prospective Nurses&rsquo; Health Study II cohort. Bertone-Johnson and colleagues3 (2005) found that women consuming 700 IU/d or more of vitamin D had a significant <strong>41% lower risk of developing PMS</strong> over the next 2 to 4 years compared with women consuming approximately 100 IU/d (P value for trend, .01). In a smaller cross-sectional study, women reporting to consume 100 IU/d or more of vitamin D from food sources had 70% lower prevalence of PMS compared with those reporting to consume less than 100 IU/d (95% CI, 0.10-0.98). However, late luteal phase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were not associated with prevalence.4</p><p>Chronic widespread pain and fibromyalgia syndromes are significantly more prevalent in women than in men, likely owing to the influence of sex steroid hormones.5 Several well-designed observational studies in women have reported inverse associations between fibromyalgia pain and 25(OH)D levels, though results overall have been inconsistent.6 Relatively few studies have evaluated the role of vitamin D in endometriosis, which is a prominent cause of secondary dysmenorrheal and associated pelvic pain. Interestingly, Somigliana and colleagues7 (2007) observed significantly higher 25(OH)D levels among patients with endometriosis compared with controls in a cross-sectional study and a positive correlation between 25(OH)D levels and disease severity, suggesting that the relation between vitamin D and endometriosis is likely complex and not yet well understood.</p><p>Vitamin D may have a positive impact on dysmenorrhea and related syndromes through a variety of mechanisms.8 In the endometrium, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D), the bioactive form of vitamin D, decreases prostaglandin synthesis by suppressing expression of cyclooxygenase-2, and increases prostaglandin inactivation by up-regulating 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D down-regulates prostaglandin receptor expression. 1,25(OH)2D may also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other pathways, such as by inhibiting nuclear factor–?B signaling and increasing mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 activity, thus blocking cytokine production via p38 activation.</p><p>The strong benefit of vitamin D on dysmenorrhea observed by Lasco and colleagues2 provides important support for larger, long-duration randomized trials of vitamin D in the treatment of menstrual pain and other pain-related conditions in women. These trials must address several key issues. First, it is important to know how long reductions in pain associated with a single high-dose vitamin D therapy would persist and how often treatment would need to be repeated. If 300 000 IU is required every 2 months, this would equate to approximately 5000 IU per day, considerably higher than the tolerable upper intake level set by the Institute of Medicine of 4000 IU/d.9 Each single dose would need to be effective for multiple months for average daily vitamin D intake to remain below this level. Furthermore, because treatment for menstrually related conditions may be necessary throughout the premenopausal years, follow-up of participants in clinical trials of vitamin D must be extended to better evaluate adverse effects and compare risks and benefits. This is especially pertinent given the findings reported by Sanders and colleagues10 (2010), who observed increased risks of fracture and falls among older women treated with a single 500 000 IU dose annually over 3 to 5 years, especially within the first 3 months after treatment. A third consideration is the baseline serum level of 25(OH)D at which supplementation may be beneficial. Women eligible for the present trial were those with 25(OH)D levels in the lower quartile of the laboratory&rsquo;s normal range. It thus remains unknown whether improvements in dysmenorrhea pain would be observable among women with higher baseline 25(OH)D levels.</p><p>If these findings are confirmed in future randomized trials, vitamin D supplementation may become an important new treatment option for women who experience menstrual pain disorders. In the meantime, encouraging all women to obtain the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D (?600 IU/d for women of reproductive age),10 as well as screening for low serum 25(OH)D levels among women with other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency, would be a rational interim approach.</p><p>AUTHOR INFORMATION</p><p>Correspondence: Dr Manson, Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Epidemiology, Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, 900 Commonwealth Ave, Third Floor, Boston, MA 02215 (<a href=mailto:jmanson@rics.bwh.harvard.edu>jmanson@rics.bwh.harvard.edu</a>).</p><p>Financial Disclosure: None reported.</p><p>Funding/Support: Dr Manson and colleagues at Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, are recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health to conduct the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), a large-scale randomized trial of vitamin D and omega-3s in the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease.</p><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p><ul><li><p>1 Proctor M, Farquhar C.
