##### Vitamin D and atherosclerosis: mechanistic links

The association between vitamin D and the prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), major established cardiovascular risk factors, and acute ischemic events has been consistently demonstrated in large-scale observational studies and meta-analyses, with relevant prognostic implications. The rise in prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in recent years, reaching pandemic pro-portions, has pointed to the importance of the identification and optimization of the indications and strategies for the therapeutic use of vitamin D, with particular relevance for cardiovascular health. However, vitamin D supplementation has provided so far inconsistent results in primary prevention, with even fewer data reported in patients with established CAD. The present review aims to provide an updated overview of the available evidence and potential therapeutic applications of vitaminD in patients with CAD.
