* This is perhaps the 25th meta-analysis of VItamin D and bone fractures.

 **There is no consensus across the many fracture meta-analyses** 

1. Most ignore the size of the vitamin D dose

> There is a lot of success in trials which use > 1,000 IU of vitamin D

1. None of the successful trials which give vitamin D to everyone are reported in meta-analyses (They virtually require a placebo)

1. None of the successful trials which use other/more than Vitamin D and Calcium are ever reported in a meta-analysis, such as Magnesium, exercise, and sunshine

#### All of the studies in this meta-analysis should be ignored - Grassroots Health - Jan 2018

 **[Vitamin D and Calcium is Not Necessary for Older Adults – Is this True?](https://grassrootshealth.net/blog/truth-in-vitamin-d-headlines/) Jan 2018** 

Carole Baggerly at Grassroots Health considered each trial and discarded those which had

* Too infrequent dosing (such as 1 /year)

* Too small of dose sizes (< 1,000 IU)

* Trials which were too short (< 12 months)

Which left only one trial <a href="/posts/4000-iu-of-vitamin-d-daily-is-safe-but-takes-a-year-to-plateau-best-d-rct-dec-20-teau-best-d-rct" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: 4,000 IU of Vitamin D daily is safe, but takes a year to plateau (Best-D) – RCT Dec 2016))
However the study was not large enough to have a statistically significant fracture result

Note how long it took for vitamin D levels in blood to rise

__Issues of trial selection and subgroup considerations in the recent meta-analysis of Zhao and colleagues on fracture reduction by calcium and vitamin D supplementation in community-dwelling older adults__
H.A. Bischoff-Ferrari B. Dawson-Hughes W.C. Willett, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-018-4587-5
*"We discuss four concerns regarding this meta-analysis, including the target population, the selection of trials with regard to blinding and duration of follow-up, and the lack of adjustment for adherence to the interventions and subgroup analysis by bolus versus daily dosing for vitamin D."

 **Key Points** 

* Question  Is supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D associated with a lower fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults?

* Findings  In this meta-analysis of 33 randomized clinical trials that included 51 145 participants, the use of supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both was not associated with a significant difference in the risk of hip fractures compared with placebo or no treatment (risk ratio, 1.53, 1.21, and 1.09, respectively).

* Meaning  These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in community-dwelling older adults.

Importance  The increased social and economic burdens for osteoporosis-related fractures worldwide make the prevention of such injuries a major public health goal. Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the association between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and fracture incidence in older adults.

Objective  To investigate whether calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements are associated with a lower fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults.

Data Sources  The PubMed, Cochrane library, and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from the inception dates to December 24, 2016, using the keywords calcium, vitamin D, and fracture to identify systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The primary randomized clinical trials included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified, and an additional search for recently published randomized trials was performed from July 16, 2012, to July 16, 2017.

Study Selection  Randomized clinical trials comparing calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment for fracture incidence in community-dwelling adults older than 50 years.

Data Extraction and Synthesis  Two independent reviewers performed the data extraction and assessed study quality. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate risk ratios (RRs), absolute risk differences (ARDs), and 95% CIs using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Hip fracture was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, and total fracture.

Results  A total of 33 randomized trials involving 51 145 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no significant association of calcium or vitamin D with risk of hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (calcium: RR, 1.53 <span>[95% CI, 0.97 to 2.42]</span>; ARD, 0.01 <span>[95% CI, 0.00 to 0.01]</span>; vitamin D: RR, 1.21 <span>[95% CI, 0.99 to 1.47]</span>; ARD, 0.00 <span>[95% CI, −0.00 to 0.01]</span>. There was no significant association of combined calcium and vitamin D with hip fracture compared with placebo or no treatment (RR, 1.09 <span>[95% CI, 0.85 to 1.39]</span>; ARD, 0.00 <span>[95% CI, −0.00 to 0.00]</span>). No significant associations were found between calcium, vitamin D, or combined calcium and vitamin D supplements and the incidence of nonvertebral, vertebral, or total fractures. Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent regardless of the calcium or vitamin D dose, sex, fracture history, dietary calcium intake, and baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials, the use of supplements that included calcium, vitamin D, or both compared with placebo or no treatment was not associated with a lower risk of fractures among community-dwelling older adults. These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements in community-dwelling older people.
