 **One or both of the following causes of low Vitamin D in obese** 

1. High fat diet ==> lower vitamin D  generated

   * abstract does not indicate strength of this reduction

1. High fat diet ==> increased obesity ==> more vitamin D stored in fatty tissue

#### [CYP2R1 in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2R1)

CYP2R1 is now known to be regulated, with variations in the expression and activity of CYP2R1 affecting circulating 25(OH)D.<sup>[9]</sup> Low levels of CYP2R1 activity have been found after 24 hour fasting, in obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes<sup>[12]</sup> and are decreased by glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone.<sup>[9]</sup> These conditions are known to be linked to low blood levels of 25(OH)D, where even large doses of vitamin D may not produce an improvement, which can be explained by enzyme activities being low.<sup>[9]</sup>
