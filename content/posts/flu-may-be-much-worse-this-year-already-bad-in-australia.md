* "Typically, seasonal flu arrives in Australia in mid-July and cases peak in early-September. But the country has been hit by a sharp and early explosion of infections over the last two months, a sign that the long-feared, post-pandemic flu revival has arrived."

"In the week leading up to June 2022, when the latest data is available, 27,000 cases were reported - roughly 10 times higher than the five-year average, which includes the pandemic period"

* "“And that’s on top of the ongoing pandemic. <span>[We’re]</span> seeing a very high new BA.5-driven <span>[wave of]</span> cases in Australia,” he added. “It’s not only Sars-CoV-2 and flu either - there have been very high levels of RSV, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses etc. all at once.”"
