Objective: Link low levels of vitamin D, osteoporotic fracture and falls.

Patients and method: Transversal observational study with the study variables of age, levels of vitamin D, osteoporotic fracture and falls. The study population was patients evaluated by the Rehabilitation Department, Hospital of Sagunto, from January 2013 to December 2014.

Results: Of the 242 patients who underwent vitamin D analysis, 70.6% showed levels under 30 ng/ml. Forty-eight percent of the patients with below normal levels of vitamin D suffered a fracture, opposed to 32.4% patients with normal levels. 

Thus, controlling by age, patients with low levels of vitamin D are  **4.8 times more likely to suffer a fracture**  than those with normal levels. 

Regarding falls, controlling by age, there is a higher risk of falling (adjusted OR 2.68) in those patients with low levels of vitamin D.

Conclusions: Patients with low vitamin D levels are more likely to suffer falls and fractures.
