Vitamin D is thought to play an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. This study aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D in uterine fibroid-related problems.</p><p>Methods: This case control study was done on 72 women with fibroid lesion (case group) who referred to Amir-al Momenin hospital, Zabol, Iran between April 2022 and December 2022. Moreover, 38 women with normal uterine morphology on ultrasonography were considered control group within the age range of 20 to 45 years. Blood samples were taken for measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Demographic and other related clinical information were collected from the patients.</p><p>Result: The ratio of BMI in the case group (73.52%) was higher than the control group (63.15%). This difference was statistically significant (P=0.002).</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency was</p><ul><li><p>common in the case group (54.90%)</p></li><li><p>as compared to controls (6.7%)</p></li></ul><p>while sufficiency was</p><ul><li>common among controls (67.8% vs. 27.45%); the difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05).</li></ul><p>Women in the control group were exposed to sunlight more often than case group which was statistically significant (P=0.002). Women with uterine fibroids, 94.11% had low exposure to sunlight compared to women in the control group (73.68%), which was statistically significant (P=0.002). Ten patients (13.88%) of case group mentioned a family history of uterine fibroids, while none of the women in the control group had this item. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.014).</p><p>Conclusion: The present study showed that patients with UFs had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D.

Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, MA, US</li></ol></li></ul><p>Introduction: Uterine fibroids affect millions of women, and non-surgical management options are limited. Vitamin D, with its potential role in cell growth regulation, may be a promising non-surgical option.</p><p>Objectives: This study reviews human studies from 2018 to 2023 to assess how vitamin D affects uterine fibroids (UFs). It aims to identify primary and secondary outcomes related to vitamin D&rsquo;s impact on UFs and stresses the importance of a core outcome set (COS) in fibroid research.</p><p>Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library used specific keywords related to vitamin D, uterine fibroids/myoma/leiomyoma, and primary and secondary outcomes. The literature search was limited to English-language publications and studies published before October 30, 2023. The review follows the PRISMA guidelines. Quality assessment was performed.</p><p>Results: Eight relevant studies with a total of 565 participants were included. In all studies, the primary outcome focused on vitamin D&rsquo;s effect on the volume/size of UFs. The most reported secondary outcomes included changes in vitamin D levels, pelvic pain or pressure, fatigue and menstrual bleeding, quality of life, and fibroids. The results show that vitamin D supplementation may have potential benefits for uterine fibroids, though the evidence remains inconclusive. While some high-quality studies reported reductions in fibroid size, others did not observe significant impacts. However, several studies have shown improvements in secondary outcomes, such as pain and quality of life.</p><p>Conclusion: The mixed results highlight the need for more rigorous, standardized research using a core outcome set (COS). Future well-designed RCTs are necessary to provide definitive answers on the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for managing UFs.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uf-review-nov-2024-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a></strong>contains many tables</p><hr><h4 id=utirine-fibroids-reduced-if-vitamin-d-was-given-for-8-weeks---meta-analysis-jan-2024>Utirine Fibroids reduced if Vitamin D was given for >8 weeks - meta-analysis Jan 2024</h4><p><strong>Effect of Oral Consumption of Vitamin D on Uterine Fibroids: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials</strong></p><p>Nutr Cancer 2024 Jan 17:1-10. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2023.2288716>doi: 10.1080/01635581.2023.2288716</a> PDF behind paywall</p><p>Saud Abdullah Alsharif 1, Saeed Baradwan 2, Majed Saeed Alshahrani 3, Khalid Khadawardi 4, Rayan AlSghan 5, Ehab Badghish 6, Ibtihal Abdulaziz Bukhari 7, Abdullah Alyousef 8, Abdulelah Mohammed Khuraybah 9, Osama Alomar 2, Ahmed Abu-Zaid 10</p><p>Impaired vitamin D status is highly prevalent among women with UFs. The objective of this first-ever systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the size of uterine fibroids (UFs). We performed a comprehensive literature search for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to September 2022.</p><p>Five trials including 511 participants (256 cases and 255 controls) were included. Pooling results from five trials, which compared size of UFs between experimental and placebo groups, revealed that vitamin D supplementation could significantly decrease the size of UFs (standardized mean difference <span>[SMD]</span>: -0.48, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: -0.66, -0.31) and cause improvement in serum level of vitamin D compared to placebo group (SMD: 3.1, 95% CI: 0.66, 5.55). A significant effect was observed in the subset of trials administering vitamin D supplementation for <strong>>8 wk</strong> (SMD: -0.62, 95% CI: -0.88, -0.37).</p><p>In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation significantly increases serum levels of vitamin D and reduces the size of UFs. However, larger, well-designed RCTs are still needed to determine the effect of vitamin D on other parameters of UFs.</p><h5 id=uf-reduction-probably-start-in-a-few-weeks-if-had-started-with-a-loading-dose>UF reduction probably start in a few weeks if had started with a loading dose</h5><hr><h4 id=growth-of-uterine-fibroids-halted-by-50000-iu-of-vitamin-d-weekly--rct-april-2021>Growth of Uterine Fibroids halted by 50,000 IU of Vitamin D weekly – RCT April 2021</h4><p><strong>The Effect of Vitamin D Deficiency on Overgrowth of Uterine Fibroids: A Blinded Randomized Clinical Trial</strong></p><p>Int J Fertil Steril. 2021 Apr-Jun; 15(2): 95–100. <a href=https://doi.org/10.22074/IJFS.2020.134567>doi: 10.22074/IJFS.2020.134567</a></p><p>Fatemeh Davari Tanha, M.D,1,2 Elham Feizabad, M.D,2,3,* Maryam Vasheghani Farahani, M.D,2 Hoora Amuzegar, M.D,2 Behnaz Moradi, M.D,4 and Saghar Samimi Sadeh, M.D5</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/uf-intervention.jpg alt=image width=600><h5 id=span-stylecolor00fnote-probably-shrink-uf-if-given-longer---takes-8-weeks-for-vitamin-d-levels-to-plateauspan><span style=color:#00f>Note: Probably shrink UF if given longer - takes 8 weeks for vitamin D levels to plateau</span></h5><p>Background: To evaluate the effects of vitamin D (vitD) supplement on uterine fibroid growth.</p><p>Materials and Methods</p><p>A randomized blinded clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary university-based hospital from August 2017 to September 2018. Totally, 204 women were enrolled into the study. They had at least one uterine fibroid >10 mm on transvaginal ultrasound and their vitD level was insufficient (i.e. 20-30 ng/ml). The intervention group was treated with vitD 50000 U supplements for two months. After 2 months, ultrasound screening and vitD level measurement was done in both groups.</p><p>Results</p><p>At first, the mean serum vitD levels in intervention and control group were 23.62 and 23.20 ng/ml, respec- tively. After 8 weeks, the mean serum vitD levels in the control and intervention group were 22.72 and 28.56 ng/ml respectively (P&lt;0.05). Also, mean fibroma diameter in the intervention group before and after 8 weeks of vitD supplementation was 43 ± 4.68 and 42.6 ± 1.31 mm, respectively. Mean uterine fibroid diameter in the control group which did not receive vitD supplements, before and after 8 weeks was 41.98 ± 5.25 and 47.81 ± 3.42 mm, respectively. The variation in the mean size of the uterine fibroid between the control and intervention group which was respectively about 5.83 mm increase and 0.48 mm decrease, was significant (P&lt;0.001).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Our results showed that vitD supplementation prevents fibroid growth. It seems that vitD supplement is a simple, safe and inexpensive modality for leiomyoma growth prevention (Registration number: IRCT201703122576N15).</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/utirine-blinded-rct.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=all-uterine-fibroid-studies-found-an-inverse-association-with-low-vitamin-d-helped-by-4-of-5-interventions--review-aug-2022>All Uterine Fibroid studies found an inverse association with low vitamin D (helped by 4 of 5 interventions) – Review Aug 2022</h4><p><strong>A Systematic Review of Vitamin D and Fibroids: Pathophysiology, Prevention, and Treatment</strong></p><p>Reprod Sci. 2022 Aug 12. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-022-01011-z>doi: 10.1007/s43032-022-01011-z</a> <strong>PDF is behind a paywall</strong></p><p>Abigail Combs 1, Bhuchitra Singh 2, Elisabeth Nylander 3, Md Soriful Islam 2, Ha Vi Nguyen 2, Elissa Parra 2, Ameerah Bello 2, James Segars 4</p><p>Uterine fibroids are the most common tumor of reproductive-age women worldwide and cause significant morbidity in affected women. Vitamin D has emerged as a potential therapy for uterine fibroids based on experimental and epidemiologic evidence. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids and its efficacy for prevention and treatment of fibroids. A comprehensive search was conducted of Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to March 2022. English-language publications that evaluated vitamin D and uterine fibroids in humans, whether experimental or clinical, were considered. The search yielded 960 publications, and 89 publications met inclusion criteria: 23 preclinical studies, 25 clinical studies, and 41 review articles. Preclinical studies indicated that the <strong>vitamin D receptor was decreased in fibroid cells</strong> . Vitamin D treatment of fibroid cells decreased proliferation, extracellular matrix protein expression, and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Fourteen clinical studies (n = 3535 participants) assessed serum vitamin D level in women with ultrasound-proven fibroids, and <strong>all found an inverse correlation between serum vitamin D level and presence of fibroids</strong> . Five clinical studies (n = 472 patients) evaluated treatment of fibroids with vitamin D.</p><p>Four of five studies showed vitamin D significantly inhibited fibroid growth.</p><p>One pilot study (n = 109 patients) of vitamin D for secondary prevention of fibroids demonstrated smaller recurrent fibroids in the treated group.</p><p><strong>These studies provide evidence for vitamin D as a therapy for Uterine fibroids</strong> and underscore the need for well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</p><h5 id=references>References</h5><ol><li><p>Baird DD, Dunson DB, Hill MC, et al.

Additionally, we evaluated the potentiality of employing these factors as a biomarker tool for the diagnosis and assessment of uterine fibroid progression.</p><p>Methods: This study involved the participation of 55 women with leiomyomas and 50 healthy women. We utilized commercial ELISA kits to measure the levels of total VitD and DBP in their serum. Additionally, we calculated the levels of free VitD and the ratio of VitD to DBP. Moreover, we determined the number, size, and location of the leiomyomas in the patients.</p><p>Results: There were no significant differences in the levels of total VitD between the groups.

Expression of Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ pathway genes was significantly increased in MED12-mutated leiomyomas compared to matched myometrium; no significant differences were found in wild-type (WT) leiomyomas. In HULP cells, VitD significantly decreased PCNA expression of both MED12-mutated and WT groups. VitD treatment decreased WNT4 and β-catenin expression in both groups compared to controls, with significance for WNT4 expression in MED12-mutated samples. Similarly, VitD significantly inhibited TGFβ3 expression in cells from both groups. MMP9 expression also decreased.</p><p>Conclusion: Despite molecular differences between MED12-mutated and WT leiomyomas, VitD inhibited Wnt/β-catenin and TGFβ pathways in HULP cells, suggesting VitD as an effective treatment to reduce proliferation and extracellular matrix formation in different molecular subtypes of uterine leiomyomas.</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-uterine-leiomyomata-is-it-time-to-let-the-sunshine-in-editorial>Vitamin D and uterine leiomyomata: is it time to let the sunshine in? editorial</h5><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uterine-fibroids-editorial.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-mechanism-of-action-and-biological-effects-in-uterine-fibroids---feb-2021>Vitamin D: Mechanism of Action and Biological Effects in Uterine Fibroids - Feb 2021</h4><p>Nutrients 2021, 13(2), 597; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020597>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020597</a></p><p>by Daniele Vergara 1,*ORCID,William H.

It was estimated that fifty percent of women presenting with UFs has symptomatology that negatively influences their quality of life. Pharmacological and/or surgical treatments are frequently required, depending on the woman’s desire to preserve fertility, with a high impact on healthcare costs. Generally, the use of currently available pharmacological treatments may lead to side effects. Therefore, there is a growing interest in a natural and safe approach for UFs. In recent years, epidemiological studies reported a vitamin D deficiency in patients with UFs raised interest in the potential biological effects of vitamin D supplementation. In vitro studies proved vitamin D efficacy in inhibiting UFs growth by targeting pathways involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, DNA repair, signaling and apoptosis. However, clinical studies supported only in part the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in reducing UFs growth and tumor volume. Randomized controlled trials and large population studies are mandatory as the potential clinical benefits are likely to be substantial.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/mechanism-of-action-and-biological-effects-in-uterine-fibroids.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=uterine-fibroid-recurrence-cut-in-half-by-1000-iu-of-vitamin-d-daily---pilot-rct-feb-2022>Uterine Fibroid Recurrence cut in half by 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily - pilot RCT Feb 2022</h4><p><strong>The effect of vitamin D on recurrence of uterine fibroids: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study</strong></p><p>Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice, Volume 46, February 2022, 101536 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2022.101536>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2022.101536</a></p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul><li><p>Vitamin D reduced recurrence rates of uterine fibroids by 50%.</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D reduced the size of recurrent uterine fibroids.</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D is a safe agent in the prevention of recurrence and reduction of the size of recurrent uterine fibroids.</p></li></ul><p>Background</p><p>and purpose: A deficiency of vitamin D has been suggested as one of the principal risk factors for uterine fibroids (UFs). We aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the recurrence of UFs.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study, women who had undergone hysteroscopic myomectomy from November 2017 to June 2020 were randomly given either vitamin D (1000 IU tablet; n = 55), or placebo (n = 54) daily for 12 months. Both groups were followed and compared in regard of the primary outcomes of the study, which were recurrence rates, size, and numbers of UFs based on three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound investigation (3D-TVS). Data analysis was performed by the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach.</p><p>Results</p><p>The mean age of the study participants was 37.9 ± 6.5 years. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographic and pre-intervention clinical characteristics. The administration of vitamin D supplements for one year reduced recurrence rates of UFs by 50% (p = 0.17). Vitamin D also reduced the size of recurrent UFs in the intervention group compared to controls (−7.7 mm), the difference was statistically different (p &lt; 0.001). No adverse effect of vitamin D was reported in the present study.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Based on these results, vitamin D appears to be a promising and safe agent in the prevention of recurrence and reduction of the size of recurrent UFs, although further well-designed and appropriately powered studies are required to demonstrate a significant difference in the size and number of recurrent UFs.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/the-effect-of-vitamin-d-on-recurrence-of-uterine-fibroids-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=pubmed---4-of-many-studies>PubMed - 4 of many studies</h4><ul><li><p>Vitamin D and Risk of Uterine Fibroids - May 2013 Hollis <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-and-risk-of-uterine-fibroids.pdf>PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Vitamin D and Uterine Fibroids—Review of the Literature and Novel Concepts - July 2018 <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-and-uterine-fibroids-review-of-the-literature-and-novel-concepts.pdf>PDF</a></p></li><li><p>Hypovitaminosis D and “small burden” uterine fibroids: Opportunity for a vitamin D supplementation - <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/hypovitaminosis-d-and-small-burden-uterine-fibroids---opportunity-for-a-vitamin-d-supplementation.pdf>PDF</a></p></li><li><p>The Significance of Measuring Vitamin D Serum Levels in Women with Uterine Fibroids - Oct 2020 <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/the-significance-of-measuring-vitamin-d-serum-levels-in-women-with-uterine-fibroids.pdf>PDF</a></p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>autoimmune</span>
