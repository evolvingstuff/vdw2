#### Deficiencies of vitamin D in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes: Think in and outside of the gut

Journal of Digestive Diseases, DOI: 10.1111/1751-2980.12283

Samantha Margulies1, Divya Kurian1, Mark S Elliott2 andZhiyong Han2,*

There is a considerable high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which is defined by the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> lower than 20 ng/ml, in all populations of the world. Unfortunately, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes, including 

* cystic fibrosis (CF), 

* celiac disease (CD), 

* short bowel syndrome, and 

* inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 

is higher than that in the general population, indicating the presence of disease-specific causative factors. 

In this review, we aim to present clinical findings to highlight the roles of insufficient sunlight exposure and inflammation in the development of vitamin D deficiency in patients with intestinal malabsorption syndromes. 

Also, we aim to present experimental evidence that supports a role of vitamin D deficiency in the pathogenesis of IBD. 

Finally, we review clinical intervention strategies that aim to normalize vitamin D status in and/or even improve the conditions of patients and discuss certain issues that need to be addressed in future research.
