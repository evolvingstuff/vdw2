#### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with diabetes and its correlation with water fluoride levels

J Water Health . 2023 Jan;21(1):125-137. [doi: 10.2166/wh.2022.254.](https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2022.254.)

Chronic exposure to fluoride through drinking water has been linked to insulin resistance and resulting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we aim to study the impact of water fluoride levels on blood glucose and vitamin D levels. A hospital-based study was conducted on diabetic patients (n = 303) at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raebareli outstation patient department (OPD). The relationship between vitamin D or fasting blood glucose levels (BGLs) with water fluoride levels was estimated through Spearman's rank correlation. We found a significant negative correlation between water fluoride and vitamin D levels <span>[rs = -0.777, p-value < 0.001]</span> and a positive correlation between water fluoride and fasting BGLs <span>[rs = 0.178, p-value <0.05]</span>. 

The participants residing in fluoride-endemic areas (F > 1.5 mg/L) had higher odds of severe vitamin D deficiency ( **odds ratio: 5.07** , 95% CI: 1.9-13.2, p-value = 0.0009). The results demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency and fasting BGLs are significantly associated with water fluoride levels. This study signifies the role of fluoride toxicity in poor glycemic control and derived vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation and the application of standard household water purification devices are recommended to tackle vitamin D deficiency in fluoride-endemic areas.

#### Fluoride in Volcanic Areas: A Case Study in Medical Geology- May 2019

DOI: 10.5772/intechopen.86058

Diana Paula Silva Linhares, Patrícia Ventura Garcia and Armindo dos Santos Rodrigues

Volcanic regions have always attracted many people worldwide because of the high fertility of their soils. However, human proximity to volcanoes can lead to several health problems as consequence of the chronic exposure to the materials released from the volcanic activity. An element often found in elevated concentrations in volcanic regions is fluorine. Although fluoride is recognized to have a beneficial effect on the rate of occurrence of dental caries when ingested in small amounts, its excessive intake results in a widespread but preventable pathological disease called fluorosis. While skeletal fluorosis, the most severe form of fluorosis, requires a chronic exposure to high concentrations of fluoride in water (4–8 mg/L), dental fluorosis occurs after shorter periods of exposure to fluoride in lower concentrations (1.5–2.0 mg/L). In some volcanic regions, where exposure to elevated amounts of fluoride is persistent, biomonitoring programs are fundamental to assess the main sources of exposure and to evaluate the effects of the exposure in resident populations. This chapter aims to cover the main effects of fluoride exposure in humans and discuss the use of a multidisciplinary approach that brings together the geoscience, biomedical, and public health communities to address environmental health problems.

#### Global analysis and prediction of fluoride in groundwater - 2022

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2022)13:4232 [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31940-x](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31940-x)

The health of millions of people worldwide is negatively impacted by chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of geogenic fluoride in groundwater. Due to health effects including dental mottling and skeletal fluorosis, the World Health Organization maintains a maximum guideline of 1.5mg/L in drinking water. As groundwater quality is not regularly tested in many areas, it is often unknown if the water in a given well or spring contains harmful levels of fluoride. Here we present a state-of-the-art global fluoride hazard map based on machine learning and over 400,000 fluoride measurements (10% of which >1.5 mg/L), which is then used to estimate the human population at risk. Hotspots indicated by the groundwater fluoride hazard map include parts of central Australia, western North America, eastern Brazil and many areas of Africa and Asia. Of the approximately 180 million people potentially affected worldwide, most reside in Asia (51-59% of total) and Africa (37-46% of total), with the latter representing 6.5% of the continent's population. Africa also contains 14 of the top 20 affected countries in terms of population at risk. We also illuminate and discuss the key globally relevant hydrochemical and environmental factors related to fluoride accumulation.
