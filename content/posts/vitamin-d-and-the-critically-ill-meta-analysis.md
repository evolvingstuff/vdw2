#### Vitamin D Supplementation in Critically Ill Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

Cureus. 2022 Apr 30;14(4):e24625. [doi: 10.7759/cureus.24625](https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.24625)

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting outcomes with the use of vitamin D in critically ill patients. With reporting of newer RCTs, we conducted this updated meta-analysis. Electronic databases were searched for RCTs comparing vitamin D with placebo in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Eleven RCTs with a total of 2,187 patients (vitamin D: n = 1,120; placebo: n = 1,067) were included. 

Vitamin D when compared to placebo was associated with the 

* decreased duration of mechanical ventilation (SMD = -0.50; 95% CI = <span>[-0.97, -0.03]</span>; p = 0.04) and 

* ICU stay (SMD = -0.60; 95% CI = <span>[-1.03, -0.16]</span>; p = 0.007) 

without any difference in the 

* mortality (RR = 0.85; 95% CI = <span>[0.68, 1.04]</span>; p = 0.12) and 

* length of hospital stay (SMD = -0.21; 95% CI = (-0.51, 0.09); p = 0.18]. 

Subgroup analysis showed that 

* parenteral vitamin D may reduce the risk of mortality (RR = 0.54; 95% CI = <span>[0.35, 0.83]</span>, p = 0.005). 

Vitamin D supplementation in critically ill patients 

* decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation and 

* ICU stay. 

Further studies should identify specific groups of patients who will derive the most benefit from vitamin D supplementation.
