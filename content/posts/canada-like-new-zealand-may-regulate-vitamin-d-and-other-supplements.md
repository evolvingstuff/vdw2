#### Canada hopes to boost regulation on natural health products. Here’s why

 **[Global News Canada](https://globalnews.ca/news/9589577/budget-2023-natural-health-products-canada-regulation/)** 

---

#### Such legislation will greatly restrict local purchasing options while increase prices

*  **A supplier would be faced with $10,000 to $100,000 cost to get appoval for each of their products in each country** 

  * Can anticipate that many suppliers will decide to not sell in Canada, New Zealand, etc

* <a href="/posts/can-get-50000-iu-vitamin-d-anywhere-on-the-globe" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Can get 50,000 IU Vitamin D anywhere on the globe">Can get 50,000 IU Vitamin D anywhere on the globe</a> 

  * Does not matter if destination restricts it, providing only a few bottles are purchased at a time

---

#### Would be far better if supplement benefits, problems, and costs were provided by non-govt entity

Example, in the US <a href="/posts/excellent-reviews-of-supplements-at-consumerlab" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Excellent reviews of supplements at ConsumerLab">Excellent reviews of supplements at ConsumerLab</a>
