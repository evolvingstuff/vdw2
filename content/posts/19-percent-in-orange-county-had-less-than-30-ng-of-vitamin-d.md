# Prevalence of Vitamin D(3) Deficiency in Orange County Residents.

J Community Health. 2011 Feb 13.

With the prevalence of sunlight exposure in Orange County, California, one would expect it to be rare and unusual to find high incidence of Vitamin D deficiencies among its residents. This study evaluated the concentration of Vitamin D3 as part of a larger study to evaluate bone health in Orange County residents. Our preliminary data shows that 19.2% of the 151 subjects evaluated had low Vitamin D3 (<30 pg/ml) and illuminates a growing problem in the United States. We speculate that the widespread sensitivity to skin cancer and sun exposure, the increased use of sun-screens and the filtering of UV waves in automobile glass has put the public at risk for low Vitamin D.
