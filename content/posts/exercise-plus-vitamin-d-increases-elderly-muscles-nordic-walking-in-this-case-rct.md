#### The Effect of Nordic Walking Training Combined with Vitamin D Supplementation on Postural Control and Muscle Strength in Elderly People-A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018 Sep 7;15(9). pii: E1951. [doi: 10.3390/ijerph15091951.](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15091951.)

12 weeks, 42 women, average age 69, 4,000 IU / 800 IU daily, 

Nordic Walking 3 times a week, for 12 weeks: high intensity / low intensity

Every training session lasted for 1h:10-min warm-up, 40 min Nordic Walk,10-min cool-down.

Training sessions started at 8 AM, so unlikely to get much vitamind D from the sun

#### Note by VitaminDWiki

1. Larger doses would have been more benefits - even for healthy participants

> Larger doses for those with fatty livers (50% of all seniors)

> Larger doses for those taking drugs which are known to decrease vitamin D levels

> Larger doses for those lacking gallbladders

1. The vitamin D probably did not get to a useful level until trial end (12 weeks)

> They should have started the vitamin D months before the training, or use loading dose

1. Would have found many bigger benefits if used larger dose sizes and started with loading dose

1. Would have had more benefit at 6 months if had continued the vitamin D past 12 weeks

1. Would have had more benefit with a given dose sizes if had

> Taken it with evening meal  (30% increase due to longer time in the gut)

> Added Magnesium (30% increase)

> Used a gut-friendly form for those with digestion problems

> Added protein, etc - see other studies, below

> For details see [Reasons for low response to vitamin D](/posts/reasons-for-low-response-to-vitamin-d)

 **Suggestion by VitaminDWiki** 

Get more beneift from 30 minute than from 120 minute sessions if 

1. Start Vitamin D months before the training 

   * Or restore Vitamin D levels with loading dose 1 week before the training

1. Add Magnesium

1. Use a gut-friendly form (~1 in 3 seniors)

1. Use Interval training

1. Have a protein snack/meal soon after each training so as to fuel the growing muscles

1. Apply topical Magnesium with DMSO to muscles to eliminate muscle pain

1. Use D-Ribose to re-stock the body so as to not feel as tired

#### Notice: Vitamin D greater response with interval training (bursts of intense exercise)

Nordic Walking (NW) and Vitamin D concentration (Vit D) alone have been shown to contribute to the health and performance of elderly people. However, the interaction between these two factors has yet to be explored. In this study 42 women over 60 years of age (69.02 ± 5.56 years) were recruited and divided in two NW groups: a high-intensity interval training group (HI-NW) and a moderate-intensity continuous training group (MI-NW). Individuals from each group completed a 12-week NW training program (3 times a week/2 hours) combined with randomized Vitamin D supplementation (HD = high dose: 4000 IU/day or LD = low dose: 800 IU/day). Body composition, postural control, muscle strength and Vitamin D serum concentration were measured twice; before and after the intervention. To investigate the interaction between supplementation and training a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The HI-NW group, regardless of supplementation dose, increased their Vit D and elbow torque performance. On the other hand, in the MI-NW group the same Vit D outcome was seen only with HD supplementation and was also associated with increased leg muscle mass. In conclusion, beneficial effects of both HI-NW and MI-NW training regimes were seen. The impact of the dose supplementation on Vit D and body composition was related to the type of NW training.
