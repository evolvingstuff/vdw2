Although vitamin D deficiency is considered an environmental factor in multiple sclerosis (MS), the immunological and clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation remain unclear. 

We performed a pilot study of the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D in healthy individuals (n=4), who took  **5000-10,000 IU/day**  of vitamin D over 15 weeks. 

After 15 weeks of vitamin D supplementation, serum 25(OH) vitamin D 

* levels rose significantly from baseline, with a 

* corresponding increase in IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a 

* reduced frequency of Th17 cells. 

These data provide a strong rationale for randomised trials to assess the clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation in MS.
