This book covers new ground. After extensive investigation and translation of numerous scientific reports into the English language, 

&nbsp; &nbsp;author Dr. John Cannell reveals a long-held secret once known only to Eastern European athletic trainers. 

In the 1960s and 70s, it was called  **Sunlamp Therapy** , and it gives athletes a definitive edge over their competitors, particularly for athletes who train for indoor or winter sports. 

That vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin, improves 

* muscle tone, 

* muscle strength, 

* balance, 

* reaction time and physical endurance, as well as 

* immunity and 

* general health, 

is a recent discovery in western medicine. 

It has application ranging from improved performance of 

* standing armies in the field, to 

* Olympic and every-day athletes, and even 

* seniors who need to avert falls and age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle tone.

### Excellent Vitamin D Book -For Sports and Others as well

Vitamin D issues nicely covered for the weekend athlete, the professional athlete, the Olympic athlete, and the senior citizen - basically anyone who moves

by Henry Lahore - administrator of VitaminDWiki

#### What I learned from the Athlete's Edge: Henry Lahore Oct 2011

* The body prioritizes the use of vitamin D – first deal with Ca/Magnesium balance pg 27

* To grow the brain cells  a nerve-growth factor gene is turned on – by the use of Vitamin D pg 36

* After getting a suntan the maximum of amount of vitamin D generated by the skin drops by half +from 20,000 down to 10,000 IU per day –pg 41

* Enzymes are turned on to break down activated vitamin D in the tissues so the tissue levels don’t build up – pg 41

* Skin sensitive to the sun may be much less sensitive after the body already had vitamin D – Dr. Cannell first found this from his daughter – pg 43

* Dr. Heaney found that healthy young men use 5,000 IU of vitamin D daily – pg 58

> recall that 3,200 IU was the minimum from some other source

* Vitamin D mistakes may be similar to previous medical mistakes 

> beriberi was actually due to lack of thiamine, 

> pellagra was due to lack of niacin; 

> birth defects were due to lack of folic acid

> In all cases itl took decades for doctors to change their attitudes: pg 74

* Even outdoor athletes can lack vitamin D: 

> Use of sun block and a desire to practice during cooler portions of the day

* Vitamin D blocks the inflammation which results from sports ‘overreaching’ pg 107

* Vitamin D might be consumed by lots of exercise pg 109  presented as a hypothesis

* Muscle trainability vs month graph – peaking in Sept, the highest vitamin D month pg 120

* Elderly ‘exercise’ studies all showed best performance by those with 50 ng vitamin D pg 135

> worse if lower OR higher levels

* Germans and Russians has been using UV for Olympics for decades, then, in 1968, the rest of the world got to use UV as well– Mexico Olympics had lots of natural UV pg 163

* Finally, in 1945 UV improvement got to the US – endurance up 19% with UV pg 171

* 1999 paper about Olympics in German:benefits in reduced lactic acid build-up, lower pulse rate, etc, pg 177

* UV produces endorphins in the skin in addition to vitamin D pg 222

* Tanning has been established as causing an addiction – is this a bad thing? Pg 223

* Sensitive skins should try stocking up on vitamin D for a month before tanning pg 228

* Tanning bed bulbs of older type (not high pressure) have much more vitamin D producing UVB than the newer high pressure bulbs pg 234

> Note: many countries restrict how much UVB, and thus vitamin D a tanning bed can produce [CLICK HERE for a file](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1848)

* UV **A**  actually destroys vitamin D in the skin pg 234 vs UV **B**  generates it

> (<a href="/posts/vitamindwiki-had-been-suspecting-this" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1669">VitaminDWiki had been suspecting this</a>, still looking for good documentation)

> This would indicate problems with sunscreens, getting sun via windows (house, truck) etc.

* Many mammals generate vitamin D on their fur – just happens that we get most of the fur from sheep pg 235

* Vitamin D can cause or highlight a Magnesium deficiency pg 247

> Mg is used by enzymes that metabolize vitamin D ==> muscle cramps

> Made me wonder about Vitamin D ==> lower Mg ==> heart muscle problem

> Blacks need more Magnesium than whites pg 247 (news to me)

* Cholecalciferol does not circulate in the blood until 25(OH0D test level is > 40 ng pg 262

> Do not recall seeing this – VERY IMPORTANT if true - cannot find any reference in the book

* After presenting vitamin D information to your doctor, be ready for hostility– pg 66

* Modern medicine is a for-profit business. Drug companies and doctors will not make a profit if you you use them less.  Pg 68  

> However, <a href="/posts/hmos-stand-to-make-a-profit" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 629">HMOs stand to make a profit</a> from vitamin D (added by VitaminDWiki)

* Uses a Q&A format: lists 14 diseases

> Answer: all 14 are associated with vitamin D AND are common among blacks

* His definitions of vitamin D levels

> <50 ng = deficiency 

> (note – some define deficiency as < 40, most define deficiency as < 30, some as < 20)

> 50-100 ng Optimal ( <a href="/posts/click-here" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2028">CLICK HERE</a> for discussion/controversy)

> 100-150 ng Borderline high

> 150-200 ng Unnecessary high levels

> >200 ng Toxic levels (<a href="/posts/one-reference-says-toxic-level-is-300-ng" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 832">one reference says toxic level is 300 ng</a>)

* Toxic level reached in a few days if have much more of a substance: pg 279

> <span style="color:#00F;">water 10X</span> (80 vs 8 glasses/day) 

> Vitamin D <a href="/posts/span-stylecolor00f1000xspan" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 898"><span style="color:#00F;">1000X</span></a>

* “<span style="color:#00F;">Worrying about vitamin D toxicity is like worrying about drowning when you are dying of thirst</span>”

> 1999 quote from Dr. Veith pg 283

#### Comments by VitaminDWiki about whole book

* He nicely has the reader think through what evolution would have done – in many locations

* He seems to feel that everyone should have 50 ng of vitamin D all of the time

   * Perhaps dark skin people have evolved to need a lower level of vitamin D <a href="/posts/click-here" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1662">CLICK HERE</a>

   * Mentions controversy: change with season pg 237
