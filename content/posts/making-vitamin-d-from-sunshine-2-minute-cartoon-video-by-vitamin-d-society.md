#### [How to make vitamin D from sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xihZu1DI49k%20) YouTube

“This short video explains how/when you can make vitamin D from sunshine in your skin. The best time to make vitamin D is midday in the summer, between 10am and 2pm, when the UV index is above 3 and your shadow shorter than your height. Know your skin and skin type, build up your exposure gradually and make sure you never burn.”
