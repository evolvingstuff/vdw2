#### Low Maternal Serum 25‐Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration Is Associated With Postpartum Hemorrhage: A Retrospective Observational Study

Objective: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between vitamin D serum level and the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The secondary objective is to determine the relative risk of low vitamin D associated with PPH.

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. A total of 600 women who had delivered their babies in a single tertiary teaching hospital were enrolled. Serum blood test for 25(OH)D was performed at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks of pregnancy to measure vitamin D. A 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL was defined as vitamin D deficient, and a level 21–29 ng/mL as insufficient.

Results: Vitamin D levels were deficient in 145 (24.1%) and insufficient in 254 (42.3%) of the women tested. Women with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels were significantly younger than those with sufficient vitamin D levels (p < 0.001). The overall rates of PPH in the deficient and insufficient groups were 6.9% (10/145) and 6.7% (17/254), respectively, and were significantly higher than the rate of the normal vitamin D group (1.5%, p = 0.009). Women with sufficient vitamin D levels had significantly higher hemoglobin levels than those with low vitamin D levels. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with a significantly low risk of PPH (AOR: 0.93, CI: 0.89–0.98, p = 0.006).

Conclusion: Our results suggest that a low vitamin D level is a risk factor for PPH. Low vitamin D also related to high risk of low hemoglobin before delivery. Thus, antepartum care should include vitamin D supplements for all women if possible.

Objective: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between vitamin D serum level and the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The secondary objective is to determine the relative risk of low vitamin D associated with PPH.

Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. A total of 600 women who had delivered their babies in a single tertiary teaching hospital were enrolled. Serum blood test for 25(OH)D was performed at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks of pregnancy to measure vitamin D. A 25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/mL was defined as vitamin D deficient, and a level 21–29 ng/mL as insufficient.

Results: Vitamin D levels were deficient in 145 (24.1%) and insufficient in 254 (42.3%) of the women tested. Women with deficient and insufficient vitamin D levels were significantly younger than those with sufficient vitamin D levels (p &lt; 0.001). The overall rates of PPH in the deficient and insufficient groups were 6.9% (10/145) and 6.7% (17/254), respectively, and were significantly higher than the rate of the normal vitamin D group (1.5%, p = 0.009). Women with sufficient vitamin D levels had significantly higher hemoglobin levels than those with low vitamin D levels. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with a significantly low risk of PPH (AOR: 0.93, CI: 0.89–0.98, p = 0.006).

Conclusion: Our results suggest that a low vitamin D level is a risk factor for PPH. Low vitamin D also related to high risk of low hemoglobin before delivery. Thus, antepartum care should include vitamin D supplements for all women if possible.
