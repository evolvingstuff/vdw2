Purpose

To compare serum level of vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> in patients with life-long premature ejaculation (LPE) versus healthy controls.

Methods

Healthy married potent males were recruited from February 2017 to January 2018. Group A included 40 patients suffering from LPE who were compared versus 40 healthy controls (Group B ). Participants suffering from hormonal disorders, obesity, neurological, psychological, or chronic diseases or taking medications that may affect ejaculatory function, serum level of vitamin D, or the accuracy of intra-vaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) were excluded. LPE was self-reported by the patients with subsequent feelings of frustration and measured by premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) and IELT using stopwatch handled by their partners. 25(OH)D was measured by obtaining 2 ml of venous blood. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t, Mann–Whitney, Chi square tests, logistic regression analysis, and Spearman correlation.

Results

Sixteen (20%) participants had vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency. All of them were in PE group. 25(OH)D correlated significantly with IELT (r2 = 0.349; p < 0.001) and PEDT (r2 = 0.425; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in age (p = 0.341), BMI (p = 1) or IIEF-5 (p = 0.408) in both groups. 25(OH)D was significantly lower in patients than controls (35.75 vs. 58.92 ng/ml, p < 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that the best cut-off value of 25(OH)D to detect patients suffering from LPE was  **50.65 ng/ml**  with a sensitivity and specificity of 85% for both. 25(OH)D remained a significant risk factor for LPE in the logistic regression analysis (p < 0.001).

ConclusionsL The current study showed that vitamin D has significant association with LPE and correlates significantly with IELT and PEDT.
