#### Having lots of vitamin D

* reduces many chronic pains

* allows the body the heal itself of some diseases

* reduces the progress of some diseases

* apparently increases many different “growth factors”, which help in healing

## How much is a high level of vitamin D?

 **Minimum of 40 nanograms, preferably 50 nanograms and perhaps > 80 nanograms.** 

## How to go about getting lots of vitamin D (under medical supervision if you can afford it)

1. Make sure you are not <a href="/posts/allergic-to-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2433">allergic to vitamin D</a>

> take perhaps a single 1,000 IU dose and watch for an allergic reaction in the next few days

1. Take a <a href="/posts/loading-dose" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 326">loading dose</a> of vitamin D to get your vitamin D level high as soon as possible

> Example: 20,000 IU vitamin D3 daily for a month (consider 40,000 daily if obese)

<a href="/posts/cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">Cofactors</a>– to increase the effectiveness of the vitamin D and balance the body

For some people the body becomes unbalanced if vitamin D is increased and cofactors such as <a href="/posts/magnesium" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 947">Magnesium</a> are not increased at the same time.

## Risk Summary – approximate

1 in 10,000 people get too much vitamin D: >150 ng  <a href="/posts/toxic" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 898">Toxic</a>

1 in 50 people: vitamin D level did not get high enough

1 in 20 people: imbalance by not taking cofactors

## How this web page came to exist  May 2012

This idea started from my noticing the 6-12 month waits Canadians have for surgery.

I thought that some Canadians should trying getting lots of vitamin D to relieve pain while waiting and perhaps get some treatment. 

Ken, my 99 year-old father-in-law, thought that I should extend the concept to those who are too old to get surgery.

Then I considered the half of the world who cannot afford medical treatment.

Then . . then . .then . . . this web page

## Canadians wait many weeks: first see the doctor, then more weeks to see the specialist

## Vitamin D might eliminate the pain and occasionally eliminate the need for the medical treatment
