### There is much disagreement on the internet about the source of vitamin D for cats

#### Cats get it from prey/food

Example [How Much Vitamin D Should My Pet Receive? ](http://www.2ndchance.info/birdsvitd.htm%20)

Dogs and cats cannot synthesize vitamin D-3; in the wild they would obtain it by eating prey so it is added to all their complete commercial pet foods.

#### Cats get it from their fur if they get time in the sun

Example[Autogrooming by cats](http://www.pawsonline.info/autogrooming.htm)

* A cat acquires the essential vitamin D by licking its fur after exposing itself to the sun.

* Self-grooming also stimulates the glands at the base of each hair. The secretions of these glands will keep the fur weatherproofed.

Example[Feline Nutrtion](http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm)

Cats cannot manufacture vitamin D or its precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol.  Cats appear to have an extremely low dietary requirement for vitamin D provided that they have exposure to some sunlight and are otherwise well nourished.

#### Cats like UV

Two of my friends have cats which are now enjoying a UV lamp similar to the <a href="/posts/low-cost-one-which-i-use-in-the-winter" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 982">low cost one which I use in the winter</a>.

#### Cat and Dog distemper

[WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_panleukopenia)

[Vitamin D Council ](http://blog.vitamindcouncil.org/2011/10/25/successful-treatment-for-feline-distemper/#comment-209) Oct 2011 mentions one cat owner who used vitamin D to treat the cat distemper.

Vitamin D does prevent and perhaps treat virus infections in humans (flu, etc.) <span>[Overview Influenza and vitamin D]</span>

 **[Zimbio](http://www.zimbio.com/Dog+Health+Information/articles/zyQCh4kA-Nj/Controlling+Seizures+Caused+Distemper) July 2011** 

In an animal with distemper, demyelination causes the lingin of the nervous tissue to be destroyed. 

Subsequently, the dog`s body attempts to fight this by using its own immune cells. 

The result is encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, which leads to seizures.

Phenobarbital is thought to be a good way to help fight against and limit your pet`s seizures. 

It might also be wise to supplement this with a Chinese herbal formula that will aid in healing the damage already done. 

On top of that, hemp oil,  **vitamin D**  and B, kelp, supplemental  **magnesium** , and vitamin C can all have a positive effect on this condition.
