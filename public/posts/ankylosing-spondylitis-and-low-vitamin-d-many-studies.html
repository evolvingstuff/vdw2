Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), ESR, CRP levels, and correlation coefficients between serum VD and BASDAI, ESR, CRP in AS, and control in these studies were extracted for the meta-analysis.</p><p>Results: When compared to controls, patients with AS had considerably lower blood 25(OH)D levels (MD = -7.53 ng/mL, 95% CI, -9.78 to -5.28, P &lt; .001) and significantly higher ESR and CRP levels (ESR: MD = 11.75 mm/h, 95% CI, 4.20 to 19.31, P = .002; CRP: MD = 15.36 mg/L, 95% CI, 4.95 to 25.77, P = .004). Additionally, a negative correlation was discovered between serum VD levels and BASDAI, ESR, and CRP (Fisher&rsquo; Z = -0.34, -0.38, -0.35, respectively).</p><p>Conclusion: The findings of our meta-analysis demonstrated a negative correlation between serum VD levels and the main monitoring indices of disease activity in patients with AS and verified that the differences in the continent and ethnicity may be one of the major contributors to this finding.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ankylosing-meta-nov-2022-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion in PDF</strong></p><p>In conclusion, our findings revealed a negative correlation between serum VD levels and the primary monitoring markers of disease activity in AS patients, including BASDAI, ESR, and CRP levels. This finding suggests that higher serum VD levels are strongly linked to both disease control and an improved quality of life for AS patients. Additionally, we confirmed that the total serum 25(OH)D levels and the inverse relationship</p><p>between serum VD levels and BASDAI in AS patients may be significantly influenced by continental and ethnic variations.</p><p><strong>Therefore, patients with AS are advised to supplement VD by sun exposure or supplements in order to lessen clinical symptoms and enhance quality of life</strong> . ESR and CRP levels were examined in our meta-analysis in relation to the occurrence of AS, but their correlation with serum VD levels was based on less conclusive evidence. Therefore, more clinical high-quality studies in these areas should be conducted in the future to further validate our results.</p><hr><h4 id=ankylosing-spondylitis-is-still-associated-with-low-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-sept-2022>Ankylosing Spondylitis is still associated with low Vitamin D - meta-analysis Sept 2022</h4><p><strong>Peripheral vitamin D levels in ankylosing spondylitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Front Med (Lausanne) . 2022 Aug 26;9:972586. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.972586>doi: 10.3389/fmed.2022.972586</a></p><p>Maohui Diao 1 , Jun Peng 1 , Daidong Wang 1 , Hongbo Wang 1</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/as-forest.jpg alt=image width=600><p>Conclusion: In conclusion, the study showed an inverse association between 25OHD and AS, which suggests that vitamin D may have a protective effect on AS.

Given that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease involving excess immune/inflammatory activity and posing great therapeutic challenges, it is conceivable to claim that vitamin D treatment may be a safe and effective treatment to influence or modify the primary disease and its related comorbidities. Nevertheless, consistent body of research supporting this hypothesis is still lacking. In this paper, we examine whether systematic screening and treatment for vitamin D deficiency are feasible at present. We will review the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D and its contribution in initiation and progression of AS, as well as how they would determine the occurrence of comorbid conditions. Our conclusion is that despite the overwhelmed interest about vitamin D treatment in AS patients, systematic screening and treatment for vitamin D deficiency of all AS patients are not feasible as yet. This stresses the need for further extensive well-designed research to prove vitamin D efficacy in AS beyond bone protection. And if utility is proven, personalized treatment regimes, duration of treatment, and threshold values for vitamin D should be provided.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/test-all-as-for-low-vit-d.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=patients-with-ankylosing-spondylitis-continue-to-have-low-vitamin-d---march-2021>Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis continue to have low Vitamin D - March 2021</h4><p><strong>Hypovitaminosis D in Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis: Frequency and Consequences</strong></p><p>Curr Rheumatol Rev. 2021 Mar 8. <a href=https://doi.org/10.2174/1573397117666210308122515>doi: 10.2174/1573397117666210308122515</a></p><p>Gehan Elolemy 1, Waleed Hassan 1, Mohamed Nasr 2, Eman Baraka 1</p><p>Objectives: Was to assess the frequency of hypovitaminosis D in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) compared to healthy controls and to evaluate its association with disease activity, structural damage and bone mineral density (BMD).</p><p>Methods: Serum 25(OH) D in 30 AS male patients was compared to 30 matched healthy controls. AS disease activity was assessed using AS Disease Activity Score and C - reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP). Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI) and Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI) were used to assess the functional impairment and the spinal mobility respectively. Radiological damage was scored according to modified Stoke AS Spine Score (mSASSS) and BMD was measured in the lumbar spine and femoral neck.</p><p>Results: The mean serum 25(OH)D levels in AS patients were significantly lower compared to healthy controls</p><p>( <strong>27</strong> .73 ± 14.27 vs. <strong>38</strong> .46 ± 8.11ng/ml, P &lt;0.001).</p><p>Among the patients, 60% exhibited hypovitaminosis D. AS patients with hypovitaminosis D had significantly higher ASDAS-CRP (p&lt;0.001), BASFAI (p=0.0003) and mSASSS (p=0.04) scores. Additionally, BMD and Z scores at lumbar and femoral sites were significantly reduced in the patients with hypovitaminosis D (P &lt; 0.05). Serum 25(OH)D was positively correlated with BMD (lumbar and femoral; p=0.002 and p=0.01 respectively) and Z scores (lumbar and femoral; p&lt;0.001and p=0.01 respectively), whereas, negatively correlated with ASDAS-CRP (p&lt;0.001), BASFI (p&lt;0.001), mSASSS (p=0.003).

Osteopenia and osteoporosis are the main complications of AS. Vitamin D has functions on the immune system. In this study, we aimed to compare vitamin D levels and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) values between AS patients and controls.</p><p>METHODS: A total of 68 patients with axial AS and 34 healthy controls were enrolled in this study conducted between March 2018 and May 2018. Vitamin D concentrations, BMD values, disease activity, back mobility, functionality and radiologic damage were evaluated.</p><p>RESULTS: Vitamin D concentrations, the total BMD-femur and BMD-femur neck values were significantly lower in AS patients (p = 0.001, p = 0.011 and p = 0.003). No significant correlations were detected between vitamin D levels and BMD-femur total, BMD-femur neck values, disease activity, back mobility, functionality and radiologic damage scores (p > 0.05). Disease activity parameters were significantly and negatively correlated with total BMD-femur and BMD-femur neck values (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that AS patients have lower vitamin D levels, total BMD-femur and BMD-femur neck values. Higher disease activity increases bone loss in AS. Regular measurement of BMD and vitamin D should be kept in mind when planning a treatment in AS.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/as-sept-2018.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=higher-vitamin-d-associated-with-less-risk-of-as---span-stylecolorf00review--meta-analysisspan-sept-2014>Higher Vitamin D associated with less risk of AS - <span style=color:red>review & meta-analysis</span> Sept 2014</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D in ankylosing spondylitis: Review and meta-analysis.</strong></p><p>Clin Chim Acta. 2014 Sep 5. pii: S0009-8981(14)00392-1. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2014.08.040.>doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2014.08.040.</a> <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span></p><p>Cai G1, Wang L1, Fan D1, Xin L1, Liu L1, Hu Y1, Ding N1, Xu S2, Xia G1, Jin X3, Xu J2, Zou Y1, Pan F4.</p><p>    PDF is available at <span>[deepdyve.com]</span> and <strong><a href=/posts/off-topic-10-ways-to-find-medical-studies-on-the-web style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Off Topic: 10 ways to find medical studies on the web">PDF is available free at Sci-Hub</a>  10.1016/j.cca.2014.08.040</strong></p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>The role of vitamin D in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is largely unknown, this paper aims to examine the association between serum vitamin D levels and susceptibility and disease activity of AS.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>We searched the relevant literatures in PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang (Chinese) Database published before June 2014.

Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with several inflammatory conditions (i.e. cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis), but it has been poorly evaluated in SpA patients. We aimed to a) describe the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in SpA patients worldwide; b) compare SpA patients with and without vitamin D deficiency in terms of disease phenotype, activity severity and comorbidities.</p><p>METHODS: This is an ancillary study of the ASAS-COMOSPA study initiative, an international cross-sectional study of patients with SpA. Demographics, patients&rsquo; phenotype, disease activity/severity measures and comorbidities were assessed. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency was defined as &lt;20 ng/mL (&lt;50 nmol/L).</p><p>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: a) prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; b) comparison of the disease presentation/activity/severity and comorbidities in the group of patients with and without vitamin D deficiency by bi-variable and multivariable analysis.</p><p>RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 527(51.2%) of the 1030 patients with available data who were not receiving any supplementation. Vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis (OR=2.1 <span>[95%CI1.3; 3.3]</span>) and a 25OHD measured in winter and spring (OR=1.88 <span>[95%CI 1.2; 2.9]</span>). No independent association between vitamin D deficiency and comorbidities was found.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that vitamin D deficiency is common in SpA worldwide and is associated with season but also with more severe forms of SpA.</p><hr><h4 id=decreased-plasma-vitamin-d-levels-in-patients-with-undifferentiated-spondyloarthritis-and-ankylosing-spondylitis---2013>Decreased plasma vitamin d levels in patients with undifferentiated spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis - 2013</h4><p>Intern Med. 2013;52(3):339-44.

Methods This study included 161 spondyloarthritis patients (113 uSpA patients and 48 AS patients) attending our rheumatology out-patient clinic, along with 92 controls.</p><p>Results The plasma vit D levels were 18 μg/L (8-38) in the AS group, 20 μg/L (4-92.3) in the uSpA group and 24.3 μg/L (7.2-76.8) in the control group. The plasma vit D levels of the AS patients were significantly lower than those of the patients in the control group (p=0.004). The men in the AS group had significanly lower vit D levels than those in the control group (p=0.005). On the other hand, the women in the uSpA group had significanly lower vit D levels than those in the control group (p=0.011). The vit D levels were inversely related to both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the AS patients (p=0.002, R=-0.428; p&lt;0.001, R=-0.592, respectively). This correlation was not demonstrated in the uSpA patients. The vit D levels were not found to correlate with the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) levels in either the AS or uSpA patients.</p><p>Conclusion 25-hydroxy-vit D deficiency is frequently observed in patients with SpAs. In this study, vit D deficiency was much more prominent in the male AS patients. On the other hand, among women, the uSpA patients exhibited much more prominent vit D deficiency than the control group subjects. The acute phase response may inversely affect the vit D levels in AS patients.</p><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><hr><h4 id=systematic-review-of-association-between-vitamin-d-levels-and-susceptibility-and-disease-activity-of-ankylosing-spondylitis---2014>Systematic review of association between vitamin D levels and susceptibility and disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis - 2014</h4><p>Rheumatology (2014); <a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keu042>doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/keu042</a>; published online: April 4, 2014</p><p>Sizheng Zhao1, Stephen J Duffield2, Robert J Moots1 and Nicola J Goodson1</p><ul><li><p>1Department of Rheumatology, Aintree University Hospital and 2School of Medical Education, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.</p></li><li><p>Correspondence to: Nicola Goodson, Department of Rheumatology, Clinical Sciences Centre, Aintree University Hospital, Longmoor Lane, Liverpool L9 7AL, UK.

Vitamin D appears to have significant effects on both innate and acquired immunity and deficiency may be associated with both susceptibility and disease severity in some autoimmune conditions. There has been little focus on the potential immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in AS. This study systematically reviews the evidence for an association between vitamin D deficiency and disease susceptibility and severity in AS.</p><p>Methods. A systematic review was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science and conference abstracts of the European League Against Rheumatism (2002–13), British Society for Rheumatology (1993–2013) and ACR (2006–13).</p><p>Results. Fifteen original articles and five conference abstracts met the criteria for inclusion. All were cross-sectional in design. <strong>Seven of 11 studies identified lower concentrations</strong> of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) in AS patients compared with healthy controls. A significant <strong>inverse correlation between 25OHD and disease activity was observed in 5 of 11 studies</strong> . The majority of studies that failed to demonstrate significant findings used inappropriate statistical methods.</p><p>Conclusion. Cross-sectional studies using appropriate statistical analyses have highlighted that AS is associated with lower vitamin D concentrations. Within groups of AS patients there is some evidence that low vitamin D concentrations are associated with higher disease activity. However, there are insufficient published data to support an immunomodulatory role for vitamin D in AS. Further study with a longitudinal design is required to understand whether optimizing vitamin D in AS has potential as a disease-modifying intervention.</p><p><strong><a href=/posts/off-topic-10-ways-to-find-medical-studies-on-the-web style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Off Topic: 10 ways to find medical studies on the web">PDF is available free at Sci-Hub</a>   10.1093/rheumatology/keu042</strong></p><hr><h4 id=4-out-of-7-studies-found-as-associated-with-low-vitamin-d---july-2014>4 out of 7 studies found AS associated with low vitamin D - July 2014</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D levels in ankylosing spondylitis: Does deficiency correspond to disease activity?</strong></p><p>Rev.

Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone with a long-established role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and in the regulation of bone formation and resorption. It is now known that vitamin D plays an immunosuppressive role in the body, and there is interest of late in the role of vitamin D in autoimmune diseases. Inflammation may be responsible for some of the loss of bone mineral density seen in AS. We reviewed the literature for studies assessing vitamin D level as a marker of AS disease activity and those examining vitamin D levels in AS in comparison to healthy controls. Four of 7 studies found a significant negative correlation between vitamin D levels ALD</p><hr><h4 id=see-also-web>See also web</h4><ul><li><p>The relationship between vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and ankylosing spondylitis: a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis - August 2022 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-022-05189-y>PDF costs $40</a></p><ul><li>VDR H vs h is 1.5 X more likely if ankylosing spondylitis.
