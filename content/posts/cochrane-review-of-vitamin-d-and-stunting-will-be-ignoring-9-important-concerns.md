#### [The effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and non-communicable diseases among infants and children younger than five years of age](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012875/full)

 **Extensive description of how the review of Randomized controlled trials will be conducted** 

#### Important concerns that they appear to be ignoring

1. Vitamin D taken during pregnancy

1. Type of vitamin D given

> Infants will reject Vitamin D oils which they cannot digest

> There are many other forms of vitamin, such as gut friendly and topical

1. Cofactors which are known to improve growth – such as Magnesium and Omega-3

1. How soon after birth were supplements started

> Day zero, day 10, month 1, month 12 . . . 

1. Extra vitamin D needed if infant is a preemie, unhealthy, etc,

1. Does the dose size vary with infant weight

1. Was the mother breastfeeding, and if so, was she supplementing

1. If using formula, was the formula fortified - was the formula low fat (2.5 X less vitamin D gets into the infant)

1. The vitamin D level achieved by the infant

> They appear to be only looking at dosing, and ignoring response to the dose

1. Skin color of the infant - dark skin infants often need much larger doses

1. Was the infant given enough time in the noon-day sun to generate Vitamin D (> 30 minutes a week)

1. Was Calcium also given

1. Will they be accounting for deaths in the non-supplemented infants?

1. Will they include RCTs with loading doses, injections, monthly doses, etc?
