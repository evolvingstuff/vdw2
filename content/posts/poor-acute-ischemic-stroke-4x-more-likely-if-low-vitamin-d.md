#### Association between Vitamin D and Short-Term Functional Outcomes in Acute Ischemic Stroke

Nutrients. 2023 Nov 29;15(23):4957. [doi: 10.3390/nu15234957.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15234957.)

Vitamin D (Vit D) affects musculoskeletal performance and central nervous system neuroprotection. We aimed to investigate the association between serum Vit D levels and short-term functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This study involved patients with acute ischemic stroke confirmed on brain MRI. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess initial stroke severity upon admission. We evaluated the functional outcomes using the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Manual Function Test (MFT), Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), Korean version of the modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) within three weeks from the onset of stroke, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at discharge. Overall, 192 patients were finally included and divided into three groups: Vit D sufficient (n = 28), insufficient (n = 49), and deficient (n = 115). Multivariate analysis showed that the Vit D deficient group presented with a higher risk of initially severe stroke (p = 0.025) and poor functional outcomes on the BBS (p = 0.048), MFT (p = 0.017), K-MMSE (p = 0.001), K-MBI (p = 0.003), and mRS (p = 0.032) compared to the Vit D sufficient group. Vit D deficiency may be associated with severe initial stroke and poor short-term post-stroke functional outcomes.
