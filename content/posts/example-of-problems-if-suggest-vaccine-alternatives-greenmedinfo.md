#### On their website July 29, 2023

We’ve experienced tremendous attention. We have more studies, articles and members than ever before but we also have lost over 2 million social media followers, and faced multiple, costly deplatformming events.

Our best estimate is that we have lost over $800,000 in revenue due to censorship.

We’ve experienced tremendous attention. We have more studies, articles and members than ever before but we also have lost over 2 million social media followers, and faced multiple, costly deplatformming events.
Our best estimate is that we have lost over $800,000 in revenue due to censorship.
