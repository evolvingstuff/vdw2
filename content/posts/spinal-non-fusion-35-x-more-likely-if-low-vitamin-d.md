STUDY DESIGN:

Prospective observational studyObjective. To investigate the association of perioperative vitamin D levels and nonunion rates and time to fusion in patients undergoing elective spine fusion.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:

Although there is a clear link between bone mineral density and the risk of osteoporosis, it is unclear whether low vitamin D levels affect rates and timing of spinal fusion.

METHODS:

Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were measured perioperatively in adults undergoing elective spinal fusion between 2011 and 2012. Vitamin D levels <20 ng/mL were considered deficient. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent predictors of pseudarthrosis/nonunion within a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare time to fusion between groups.

RESULTS:

Of the 133 patients, 31 (23%) demonstrated vitamin D deficiency. Mean patient age was 57±13 years; 44% were female and 94% were Caucasian. The cervical spine was fused in 49%, the lumbar spine in 47%, and the thoracic spine in 4%. Mean construct length was 2 levels (range 1-16). At 12-month follow-up, 112/133 (84%) patients demonstrated fusion (median time to fusion 8.4 months). Nonunion at 12 months was associated with vitamin D deficiency (20% of patients with adequate vitamin D level vs. 38% of vitamin D-deficient patients, p = 0.063). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated time to fusion was significantly longer in the vitamin D-deficient group (12 vs. 6 months, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, vitamin D deficiency was an independent predictor of nonunion  **(OR 3.449** , p = 0.045) when adjusted for age, sex, obesity, fusion length, location, graft type, smoking, and bone morphogenetic protein use.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D levels may affect nonunion rate and time to fusion. These results offer insight into the importance of the metabolic milieu for bony fusion as well as a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention.

#### [Study was reported in Becker's Spine Review](http://www.beckersspine.com/spine/item/27485-vitamin-d-s-association-with-spinal-fusion-non-unions-5-things-to-know.html) - 5 key points

* 1. There were 31 patients — 23 percent — who had a vitamin D deficiency at the time of surgery. There were 84 percent of the patients who showed fusion eight months after surgery.

* .2. After 12 months, there was an association between non-unions and vitamin D deficiency. Twenty percent of the patients with adequate vitamin D reported non-unions while 38 percent of the vitamin D-deficient patients reported non-unions.

* 3. The time to union was significantly longer — 12 months — for the vitamin D-deficient patients compared with six months for the non-deficient patients.

* 4 The vitamin D deficiency as an independent predictor of non-union held up when adjusting for age, sex, obesity, fusion length, location, graft type, smoking and bone morphogenetic protein use.

* 5. The researchers concluded their "results offer insight into the importance of the metabolic milieu for bony fusion as well as a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention."

 **Wonder how many years it will take for researchers to consider adding Vitamin D to increase human spinal fusion?    
Wonder also if they will try adding [Vitamin K2](/posts/overview-vitamin-k-and-vitamin-d) - which helps build bones.  Henry Lahore, Oct 2015**
