#### Effect of Protein Supplementation Combined With Resistance Training in Gait Speed in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

J Aging Phys Act. 2024 May 15;32(5):668-678. [doi: 10.1123/japa.2023-0285.](https://doi.org/10.1123/japa.2023-0285.) .Behind $25 paywall

Background: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of protein supplementation and resistance training (RT), compared with RT alone or combined with a placebo, in improving gait speed.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus databases, and 18 randomized controlled trials with 1,147 older participants were included for meta-analysis. Data were pooled as the effect sizes (Hedges' g) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the gait speed (in meters per second). The random-effect meta-analysis, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were conducted.

Results: The combination of protein supplementation and RT significantly improved gait speed (Hedges' g: 0.52 m/s, 95% confidence interval <span>[0.17, 0.86]</span>, p = .005; I2 = 86.5%) compared with the RT alone. The subgroup analyses revealed that the significant improvement in gait speed postprotein intervention plus RT was observed only in participants who  **consumed protein after RT**  (Hedges' g: 0.90 m/s, 95% confidence interval <span>[0.46, 1.33]</span>, p = .001; I2 = 79.6%). The pooled result did not significantly change after excluding any single study at one time or excluding smaller studies with large effect sizes.

Conclusions: Protein supplementation combined with RT could significantly improve the gait speed of older adults compared with RT alone. This positive effect is more pronounced in people who consume protein after RT.

The supplemental protein doses ranged from 10 to 45 grams daily, with some studies dosing protein based on body weight, with up to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Protein intake was timed based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening), meal intake (after breakfast, lunch, and dinner), or timing of resistance training (after exercise). The control groups received a carbohydrate-based placebo drink or no intervention.”

* "The resistance training protocols varied across studies but typically included exercises that targeted major muscle groups, such as squats, leg press, and bench press. The volume typically included multiple sets of 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise. The frequency of resistance training was 2 to 7 times per week, with intensities ranging from 50% to 80% of the participants' 1-repetition maximum (1RM). The duration of the intervention ranged from 10 to 24 weeks, with a median duration of 12 weeks."

* "esearch indicates that consumption of 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is needed to optimize results.<sup>[3]</sup>"

The frequency of resistance training was 2 to 7 times per week, with intensities ranging from 50% to 80% of the participants&#39; 1-repetition maximum (1RM). The duration of the intervention ranged from 10 to 24 weeks, with a median duration of 12 weeks.&quot;`├── TextNode

!!!!Effect of Protein Supplementation Combined With Resistance Training in Gait Speed in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
J Aging Phys Act. 2024 May 15;32(5):668-678. doi: 10.1123/japa.2023-0285. .Behind $25 paywall

Background: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of protein supplementation and resistance training (RT), compared with RT alone or combined with a placebo, in improving gait speed.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus databases, and 18 randomized controlled trials with 1,147 older participants were included for meta-analysis. Data were pooled as the effect sizes (Hedges&#39; g) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of the gait speed (in meters per second). The random-effect meta-analysis, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and sensitivity analysis were conducted.

Results: The combination of protein supplementation and RT significantly improved gait speed (Hedges&#39; g: 0.52 m/s, 95% confidence interval [0.17, 0.86], p = .005; I2 = 86.5%) compared with the RT alone. The subgroup analyses revealed that the significant improvement in gait speed postprotein intervention plus RT was observed only in participants who __consumed protein after RT__ (Hedges&#39; g: 0.90 m/s, 95% confidence interval [0.46, 1.33], p = .001; I2 = 79.6%). The pooled result did not significantly change after excluding any single study at one time or excluding smaller studies with large effect sizes.

Conclusions: Protein supplementation combined with RT could significantly improve the gait speed of older adults compared with RT alone. This positive effect is more pronounced in people who consume protein after RT.

*“The types of supplemental protein used in the studies included milk, whey protein, soy protein, casein, and protein mixtures. The supplemental protein doses ranged from 10 to 45 grams daily, with some studies dosing protein based on body weight, with up to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight per day. Protein intake was timed based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, and evening), meal intake (after breakfast, lunch, and dinner), or timing of resistance training (after exercise). The control groups received a carbohydrate-based placebo drink or no intervention.”
*&quot;The resistance training protocols varied across studies but typically included exercises that targeted major muscle groups, such as squats, leg press, and bench press. The volume typically included multiple sets of 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise. The frequency of resistance training was 2 to 7 times per week, with intensities ranging from 50% to 80% of the participants&#39; 1-repetition maximum (1RM). The duration of the intervention ranged from 10 to 24 weeks, with a median duration of 12 weeks.&quot;
*&quot;esearch indicates that consumption of 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is needed to optimize results.[3]&quot;
