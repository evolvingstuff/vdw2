PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Summary highlighting the evidence that bone health may affect forearm fracture risk in children. 

RECENT FINDINGS: Although the incidence of other fractures and injuries are decreasing, the incidence of forearm fractures is increasing in otherwise healthy children. There is a growing volume of research that forearm fracture risk in children may be related to deficiencies in parameters of bone health. Available evidence of this relationship was summarized and included direct links to bone health (measurement of bone properties), indirect links to bone health (diet,  **vitamin D status** , BMI), and genetic analyses. 

SUMMARY: There is consistent and convincing evidence of an association between bone mineral density and forearm fracture risk in children. Studies of calcium intake and supplementation are less extensive in scope but suggest that effects of calcium deficiency on the radius may contribute to childhood forearm fracture risk.  **Forearm fracture risk in obese children**  is likely to reflect a combination of suboptimal bone health status and behavioral characteristics. 

Published data on the role of vitamin D status and genetic factors are limited but merit further consideration. Further investigation is needed to better understand the factors contributing to forearm fracture risk in children and translate this knowledge into effective clinical prevention and practice.

## No surprise here. Obese people have low vitamin D, low vitamin D makes for weaker bones
