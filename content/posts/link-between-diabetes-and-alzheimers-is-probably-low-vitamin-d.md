[Study: Adults with diabetes more prone to dementia](http://www.whec.com/news/stories/S2291815.shtml?cat=566) Sept 2011

For 11 years, Japanese researchers followed more than 1,000 people, ages 60 and older.  

They found that those with diabetes at the outset were 35 percent more likely to develop Alzheimer's.  

 **Those with the most severe diabetes had more than triple the risk.** 

## [Deficiency of Vitamin D](/categories/deficiency-of-vitamin-d) has the following graph

## Diabetes is in a vicious circle with vitamin D.

### Low vitamin D increases diabetes, and diabetes decreased vitamin D even more.

### Vitamin D spirals lower and lower
