Objective The present study was designed to assess the effects of Ca+vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Design A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among sixty women with GDM. Participants were divided into two groups to receive Ca+vitamin D supplements or placebo. Individuals in the Ca+vitamin D group (n 30) received 1000 mg Ca/d and two pearls containing 1250 µg (50 000 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) during the intervention (one at study baseline and another at day 21 of the intervention); those in the placebo group (n 30) received two placebos of vitamin D at the mentioned times and placebos of Ca every day for 6 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were determined.

Setting A urban community setting in Arak, Iran.

Subjects Sixty women with GDM and their newborns, living in Arak, Iran were enrolled.

Results Women treated with Ca+vitamin D had a significant decrease in 

* caesarean section rate (23·3 % v. 63·3 %, P=0·002) and 

* maternal hospitalization (0 v. 13·3 %, P=0·03) 

compared with those receiving placebo. 

In addition, newborns of GDM women randomized to Ca+vitamin D had  **no case of macrosomia** , while the prevalence of macrosomia among those randomized to placebo was 13·3 % (P=0·03). 

 **Lower rates of hyperbilirubinaemia**  (20·0 % v. 56·7 %, P=0·03) and hospitalization (20·0 % v. 56·7 %, P=0·03) were also seen in the supplemented group of newborns than in the placebo group.

Conclusions Ca+vitamin D supplementation for 6 weeks among pregnant women with GDM led to decreased caesarean section rate and maternal hospitalization, and decreased macrosomia, hyperbilirubinaemia and hospitalization in newborns.
