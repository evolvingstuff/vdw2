Introduction

Nitrate and nitrite are naturally occurring in both plant- and animal-sourced foods, are used as additives in the processing of meat, and are found in water. There is growing evidence that they exhibit a spectrum of health effects, depending on the dietary source. The aim of the study was to examine source-dependent associations between dietary intakes of nitrate/nitrite and both all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Methods

In  **52,247 participants**  of the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study, associations between source-dependent nitrate and nitrite intakes––calculated using comprehensive food composition and national drinking water quality monitoring databases––and all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related, and cancer-related mortality over **27 years**  were examined using restricted cubic splines within Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and dietary confounders. Analyses were stratified by factors hypothesised to influence the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (namely, smoking and dietary intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, and polyphenols).

Results

Plant-sourced nitrate intake was inversely associated with all-cause mortality <span>[HRQ5vsQ1: 0.83 (0.80, 0.87)]</span> while higher risks of all-cause mortality were seen for higher intakes of naturally occurring animal-sourced nitrate <span>[1.09 (1.04, 1.14)]</span>, additive permitted meat-sourced nitrate <span>[1.19 (1.14, 1.25)]</span>, and tap water-sourced nitrate <span>[1.19 (1.14, 1.25)]</span>. Similar source-dependent associations were seen for nitrite and for CVD-related and cancer-related mortality except that naturally occurring animal-sourced nitrate and tap water-sourced nitrate were not associated with cancer-related mortality and additive permitted meat-sourced nitrate was not associated with CVD-related mortality. No clear patterns emerged in stratified analyses.

Conclusion

Nitrate/nitrite from plant sources are inversely associated while those from naturally occurring animal-sources, additive-permitted meat sources, and tap water-sources are positively associated with mortality.

#### Why are plant nitrates so much healthier than animal nitrates? (asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024)

Plant nitrates are considered healthier than animal nitrates due to several key differences in how they are processed and their effects on the body.

 **Source and Breakdown** 

*  **Plant Nitrates** : Found naturally in vegetables such as leafy greens, beets, and root vegetables. When consumed, these nitrates are converted into  **nitric oxide**  in the body, which has beneficial effects such as improving blood flow, lowering blood pressure, and supporting cardiovascular health. This conversion is facilitated by the presence of antioxidants like vitamin C in vegetables, which help prevent the formation of harmful nitrosamines.

*  **Animal Nitrates** : Often found in processed meats where nitrates are added as preservatives. These added nitrates can break down into nitrosamines, especially when exposed to high heat during cooking. Nitrosamines are carcinogenic and have been linked to an increased risk of cancers, particularly those of the digestive system.

 **Health Implications** 

*  **Cardiovascular Health** : Plant-based nitrates contribute to the production of nitric oxide, which helps in maintaining cardiovascular health by improving blood circulation and lowering blood pressure.

*  **Cancer Risk** : The antioxidants in vegetables help inhibit the formation of nitrosamines, reducing cancer risk. Conversely, nitrates from processed meats can form nitrosamines, increasing the risk of cancers such as colorectal, stomach, and esophageal cancer.

*  **Mortality Rates** : Research indicates that higher intakes of plant-sourced nitrates are associated with a lower risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease-related, and cancer-related mortality. In contrast, higher intakes of nitrates from animal sources and processed meats are linked to increased mortality risks.

 **Mechanisms of Action** 

*  **Nitric Oxide Pathway** : Plant nitrates are more likely to be converted into nitric oxide due to the presence of antioxidants in vegetables. Nitric oxide has various health benefits, including vasodilation, which improves blood flow and reduces blood pressure.

*  **Nitrosamine Formation** : Animal nitrates, especially from processed meats, are more prone to converting into nitrosamines, particularly under high temperatures during cooking. Nitrosamines are known carcinogens and contribute to higher cancer risks.

In summary, plant nitrates are healthier due to their conversion into beneficial nitric oxide and the presence of antioxidants that prevent harmful nitrosamine formation. Animal nitrates, particularly from processed meats, pose health risks due to their potential to form carcinogenic nitrosamines.
