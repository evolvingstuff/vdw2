#### 4 gut problems are associated with low vitamin D levels - Perplexity AI June 2024

* Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis:

> Vitamin D deficiency is more common among those with IBD.

> Lower vitamin D levels are associated with higher disease activity and severity in Crohn's disease.

> Vitamin D deficiency may be implicated in the etiology and severity of IBD.

> Individuals with higher serum vitamin D have a lower incidence of IBD, particularly Crohn's disease.

* Constipation:

> A study found that patients with chronic functional constipation and intestinal motility disorders had lower vitamin D levels compared to healthy controls.

> Low vitamin D levels were significantly correlated with constipation symptoms and impaired quality of life in these patients.

* Diarrhea:

> Low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of rotaviral diarrhea in children under 5 years old.

> A study found lower vitamin D levels in children with acute bacterial diarrhea compared to healthy children.

* General Gastrointestinal Inflammation:

Vitamin D plays a role in maintaining gastrointestinal barrier integrity, regulating gut microbiota, and modulating inflammatory immune responses, which are important in preventing and ameliorating gut inflammation.

#### Celiac assocated with both low vitamin D and poor Vitamin D Receptor - meta-analsys - Feb 2023

 **A meta-analysis suggests the association of reduced serum level of vitamin D and T-allele of Fok1 (rs2228570) polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor gene with celiac disease** 

Front Nutr . 2023 Jan 19;9:996450. [doi: 10.3389/fnut.2022.996450](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.996450)

Purpose: As an immune-modulator, vitamin D is known to regulate immune response and is implicated in disease pathogenesis. Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic autoimmune disease and susceptibility conferred by vitamin D metabolism is under investigation. Studies on the association of vitamin D metabolism and genetic polymorphisms are expected to explain CD pathogenesis. We performed a systematic review-based meta-analysis to investigate the 25(OH)D serum levels and susceptibility conferred by the genetic variants of VDR in CD.

Methods: Systematic review was conducted through a web-based literature search following stringent study inclusion-exclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and GRADE tools were used to assess the quality of evidence in studies and the study outcome. Cohen's κ value was estimated to access the reviewer's agreement. RevMan 5.4.1 was used to perform the meta-analyses. Weighted mean difference and Meta p-value was assessed for 25(OH)D serum levels. Meta-odds ratio and Z-test p-value were evaluated to estimate the allelic susceptibility of VDR variants.

Results: A total of 8 out of 12 studies were evaluated for "25(OH)D" serum level, while four studies were found eligible for SNPs (Bsm1, Apa1, Fok1, and Taq1) of VDR. Significantly higher levels <span>[WMD = 5.49, p < 0.00001]</span> of 25(OH)D were observed in healthy controls than in patients with CD. rs2228570-T (Fok1) <span>[Meta-OR = 1.52, p = 0.02]</span> was confirmed to be predisposing allele for CD.

Conclusion: Reduced serum level of 25(OH)D and association of Fok1 T-allele of VDR confirmed in this study plays a critical role in immunomodulation and maintaining barrier integrity, which is majorly implicated in CD.

#### Celiac disease is the most common genetic disease in Europe.

In Italy about 1 in 250 people and in Ireland about 1 in 300 people have celiac disease.

#### Celiac Disease is similar to Crohn's Disease in that both decrease vitamin D which can be absorbed in the gut

#### Does Gluten-Free Diet Protect Children with Celiac Disease from Low Bone Density? - Aug 2014

 **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/cd-and-low-vitamin-d-july-2014.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a>** 

They believe: CD ==> poor absorption ==> low vitamin D ==> low Bone Mineral Density

They conclude that if teen with CD has bone pain should have DXA test of BMD, then might consider giving vitamin D.
