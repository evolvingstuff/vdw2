#### Vitamin D toxicity us a complete myth - 6 minute video May 2024

 **[Dr. Berg 7 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_U5QRk_Wrc&t=329s)** 

Magnesium deficiency is incredibly common. 

If you’re not taking enough magnesium while you’re taking vitamin D, you may begin to notice the following “vitamin D toxicity symptoms”:

• Irritability

• Insomnia

• Constipation 

• Fatigue

• Muscle spasms/cramps

• Calcium buildup

• Arrhythmia 

 **Coincidentally, these are also symptoms of low magnesium and low vitamin K2.** 

There are case studies involving vitamin D toxicity; however, the subjects did not take vitamin K2 or magnesium. 

In many cases, they were taking vitamin D2 rather than vitamin D3. 

You don’t want to take calcium when testing for vitamin D toxicity because one of the symptoms of vitamin D toxicity is hypercalcemia or too much calcium in the blood.

According to Wikipedia, some symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are due to vitamin K depletion. 

Vitamin K2 is essential to prevent calcium buildup in the soft tissues. 

Vitamin D helps increase calcium absorption in the small intestine by 20 times. 

Therapeutic doses of vitamin D can be especially beneficial for autoimmune conditions. 

Dr. Coimbra from Brazil utilizes a vitamin D protocol involving up to 200,000 IU. 

If you’re taking vitamin D supplements, also take magnesium and vitamin K2. 

You also want to ensure adequate boron, zinc, and vitamin A intake.

* [How Much Vitamin D is Too Much? The Surprising Truth](http://authoritynutrition.com/how-much-vitamin-d-is-too-much/) Sept 2015?

> Nice overview - here are some of the conclusions

> "Bottom Line: Blood levels in the range of 20–30 ng/ml are usually considered sufficient. The safe upper limit is considered to be about 60 ng/ml, but people with symptoms of toxicity usually have levels above 150 ng/ml."

> "Bottom Line: The safe upper limit of intake is set at 4000 IU/day. Intake in the range of 40,000–100,000 IU/day (10-25 times the recommended upper limit) has been linked with toxicity in humans."

> "Bottom Line: If you are supplementing with vitamin D, then it may be important to also ensure sufficient intake of vitamin A, vitamin K, and magnesium. These may reduce the risk of adverse effects from a higher vitamin D intake."
