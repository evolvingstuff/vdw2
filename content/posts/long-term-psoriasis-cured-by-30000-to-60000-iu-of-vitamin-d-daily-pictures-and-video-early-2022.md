##### Abstract

Evidence suggests vitamin D3 resistance with gene polymorphisms related to its metabolism to have a potential role in the patho-prognosis of psoriasis. We report 6 cases of psoriasis treated with daily oral Vitamin D3 (25 hydroxy cholecalciferol) in doses ranging from 30,000 IU to 60,000 IU over a period of 2 to 6 months and then followed by lower daily maintenance dose. The dose of vitamin D3 was adjusted  **based on the drop in the level of parathyroid hormone**  as the ionized calcium levels were also periodically monitored to prevent hypercalcemia.

Complete control of psoriasis was observed within a span of 2-6 months, which was measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and a symptom Visual analog scale. Our observations suggest that supervised, daily oral higher than usual Vitamin D3 can be given safely as an effective therapeutic modality for treating psoriasis.

 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D3 and resistance and subsequent deficiency play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

* A high daily dose of vitamin D3 is a safe therapeutic option in managing psoriasis.

* Vitamin D3 therapy offers complete remission of psoriasis without any adverse events.

* The results of this case series warrants robust clinical trials.

#### VitaminDWiki would suspect an even faster cure if Topical Vitamin D had been used

 **The founder of VitaminDWiki has used [Topical Vitamin D](/posts/topical-vitamin-d) for over a decade.  
 Only need a few drops on my knee once every 4 months  
Topical appears to provide 100X higher concentration of vitamin D to the skin than oral**
