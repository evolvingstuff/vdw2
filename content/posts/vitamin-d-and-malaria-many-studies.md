#### The role of Vitamin D in malaria – Jan 2015

J Infect Dev Ctries. 2015 Jan 15;9(1):8-19. [doi: 10.3855/jidc.3687.](https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.3687.)

An abnormal calcium-parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D axis has been reported in patients with malaria infection. A role for vitamin D in malaria has been suggested by many studies. Genetic studies have identified numerous factors that link vitamin D to malaria, including human leukocyte antigen genes, toll-like receptors, heme oxygenase-1, angiopoietin-2, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, and Bcl-2. Vitamin D has also been implicated in malaria via its effects on the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, matrix metalloproteinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, prostaglandins, reactive oxidative species, and nitric oxide synthase.

Vitamin D may be important in malaria; therefore, additional research on its role in malaria is needed.

##### Conclusions (Clipped from PDF)

In this paper, the relationship between vitamin D and malaria was reviewed. Genetic studies provide opportunities to determine which proteins link vitamin D to malaria pathology. Vitamin D is able to act through numerous non-genomic mechanisms, including protein expression, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular metabolism. Therefore, further research on the role of vitamin D in malaria is needed, and a cautious approach is advisable before recommending the widespread use of vitamin D for malaria.

#### Can Vitamin D fight malaria? - asked Chat-GPT-4 Dec 2023

Vitamin D has been studied for its potential role in the prevention and treatment of various diseases, including infectious diseases. Regarding malaria specifically:

1.  **Immune System Modulation** : Vitamin D is known to play a crucial role in modulating the immune system. It can enhance the body's immune response, which could potentially help in fighting off infections like malaria.

1.  **Research Findings** : Some studies have suggested that vitamin D might have a protective effect against malaria. For example, a higher level of vitamin D in the body has been associated with reduced risk of severe malaria in some populations. However, these findings are not conclusive and more research is needed to establish a clear link.

1.  **Prevention and Treatment** : While vitamin D may have a potential role in the prevention or treatment of malaria, it should not replace conventional anti-malarial drugs and preventive measures such as mosquito control and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets.

1.  **Mechanism of Action** : The exact mechanism by which vitamin D could potentially impact malaria is not fully understood. It might involve the regulation of inflammatory responses or direct effects on the malaria parasite itself.

1.  **Caution and Consultation** : It's important to approach the use of vitamin D for malaria with caution. Self-treatment without proper medical guidance can be dangerous, especially in areas where malaria is prevalent. Consulting healthcare professionals for appropriate prevention and treatment strategies is essential.

In summary, while there is some evidence that vitamin D might play a role in the body's defense against malaria, it is not a standalone treatment or prevention method. Continued research is necessary to fully understand its potential benefits and limitations in this context.
