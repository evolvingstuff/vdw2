#### Asked [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-measles-has-any-assocatio-R7RVDRmdTeWtU8ZE1uAOvQ): Does Measles has any assocation with low vitamin D?

Based on the search results, there are significant associations between vitamin D levels and measles, particularly regarding antibody responses and disease severity:

 **Vitamin D and Measles Antibody Relationship** 

A comprehensive study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) revealed an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and measles antibody titers. Participants with higher measles antibody titers showed significantly lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, with approximately an 8.18% decrease in vitamin D levels compared to those with lower antibody titers   [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30500845/)

 **Maternal-Child Vitamin D Impact** 

Research has shown that vitamin D plays a crucial role in immune responses through vitamin D receptors (VDR) expressed on immune cells. A study of mother-child pairs demonstrated:

* Strong correlation between maternal vitamin D levels and infants' anti-measles virus antibody responses (r2=0.71)  [2](https://repository.maseno.ac.ke/handle/123456789/834)

* Varying vitamin D status among pregnant women and infants, with some showing deficiency (<25nmol/L) and insufficiency (<50nmol/L)   [2](https://repository.maseno.ac.ke/handle/123456789/834)

 **Nutritional Status and Antibody Response** 

Multiple micronutrients, including vitamin D, have been found to influence measles antibody responses. Deficiencies in vitamin D, along with vitamins A and B12, and iron, were associated with lower measles IgG titers   [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2475299123095422)

 **Clinical Implications** 

The relationship between vitamins and measles severity has been documented, particularly with vitamin A. Studies have shown that vitamin levels decrease during measles infection, and children with lower vitamin levels tend to experience:

* Higher fever rates

* Longer duration of fever

* Increased likelihood of hospitalization

* Lower measles-specific antibody levels   [4](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/516043)

These findings suggest that maintaining adequate vitamin D levels may be important for optimal immune response to measles infection and vaccination, though more research is needed to fully understand these relationships.

#### Asked Perplexity AI: [Does Measles has any assocation with low vitamin A?](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-measles-has-any-assocatio-WWTh1p6nT3KXzrxKcR8bAQ)

The relationship between measles and vitamin A is significant and well-documented. Here's a comprehensive explanation of their association:

 **Disease Mechanism** 

Measles infection directly impacts vitamin A levels in several ways:

* The virus depletes existing vitamin A stores in the body and increases its utilization &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3437709/)

* Even well-nourished children can experience abnormally low retinol levels during measles infection &nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/)

* The combined effect of vitamin A deficiency and measles infection can be particularly serious, as both conditions affect immune function and epithelial tissue &nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/)

 **Clinical Impact** 

 **Severity of Illness** 

Children with low vitamin A levels during measles infection are more likely to experience:

* Higher fevers (40°C or higher)

* Extended fever duration (7 days or more)

* Increased hospitalization rates

* Lower measles-specific antibody levels &nbsp;[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/516043)

 **Treatment Benefits** 

Vitamin A supplementation has shown significant benefits:

* Reduces mortality risk by 87% in children under 2 years &nbsp;[4](https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles)

* Shortens diarrhea duration by 2 days

* Reduces fever duration by 1 day &nbsp; [4](https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles)

 **Current Recommendations** 

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends:

* Administration of 200,000 IU of vitamin A twice to children over age 1 with measles &nbsp;[5](https://www.nfid.org/what-you-should-know-about-measles-and-vitamin-a/)

* All children presenting with measles should receive age-appropriate vitamin A doses, regardless of nutritional status &nbsp;[5](https://www.nfid.org/what-you-should-know-about-measles-and-vitamin-a/)

 **Risk Factors** 

The association between measles and vitamin A deficiency is particularly concerning in:

* Children under 2 years of age

* Populations in low and middle-income countries

* Areas where vitamin A deficiency is prevalent &nbsp;[4](https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles)

#### Does Vitamin D fight most enveloped virus? - Asked Perplexity AI - Aug 2024

Based on the provided search results, there is evidence suggesting that vitamin D may help fight against many enveloped viruses:

1. Vitamin D has been shown to have direct anti-viral effects, particularly against enveloped viruses. It may disrupt viral envelopes through interactions similar to anti-microbial peptides.

1. Vitamin D enhances cellular innate immunity partly through the induction of antimicrobial peptides like human cathelicidin LL-37 and defensins. These peptides exhibit direct antimicrobial activities against a spectrum of microbes, including enveloped viruses.

1. A meta-analysis underlined the vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI polymorphism as a risk factor for enveloped virus infection. The analysis included studies on dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and hepatitis B virus.

1. Vitamin D deficiency has been reported to increase the risk of several viral infections including influenza, HIV, and COVID-19, many of which are caused by enveloped viruses. Vitamin D supplementation is proposed to reduce infection risk or severity in these cases.

1. Vitamin D contributes to reducing the risk of microbial infection, including enveloped viruses, through actions on physical barriers, cellular natural immunity, and adaptive immunity. It induces production of cathelicidins and defensins that have direct activity against enveloped viruses.

In summary, while more research is needed, the available evidence suggests vitamin D likely plays a beneficial role in fighting against and preventing infections with many enveloped viruses through various mechanisms involving the immune system and direct antiviral activities.   [5 references in Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-vitamin-d-fight-most-enve-Pa7C14rdRVK2YLZ0q7MWUA)

#### Measles not expected to be stopped until 95% of all children are vaccinated (currently 60% in some countries) - March 2025

 **[Well Being: Measles- Truth Versus Fiction](https://www.malone.news/p/well-being-measles-truth-versus-fiction?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=583200&post_id=158103114&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=ofo3r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email) Robert Malone - substack** 

there were 1200 cases of measles in the US in 2019

* "The USA now has a predominantly MMR-vaccinated population, which has less immunity than those who were exposed to the disease, typically in childhood. The implication is that vaccine-resistant cases of measles are and will become more commonplace."  No more natural herd immunity

* "If I were a parent and wished to use the MMR vaccine, I would push out that timeline of 12 to 15 months (CDC) much further, basically until at least the child is school-aged. "
