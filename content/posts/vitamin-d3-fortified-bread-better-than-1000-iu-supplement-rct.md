CONTEXT: Bread can potentially be a suitable vehicle for fortification with vitamin D.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate (1) bioavailability of vitamin D from the fortified Iranian bread, and (2) the possible effects of daily consumption of the fortified bread on certain health aspects.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomized double blind placebo-controlled trial conducted over 8 weeks in 90 healthy subjects aged 20-60 yr.

INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups:

* (a) **fortified bread (FP** ; 50 g bread fortified with 25μg vitamin D3 plus placebo daily; n1 = 30); 

* (b)  **supplement (SP** ; 50 g plain bread plus 25μg vitamin D supplement daily; n2 = 30); and 

* (c)  **control (CP** ; 50 g plain bread plus placebo daily; n3 =30).

OUTCOME:Measures: Initial and final anthropometric and biochemical assessments were performed.

RESULTS: The within-group changes of serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 39.0±22.6 (p<0.001), 28.9±31.2 (p<0.001) and -9.2±12.3 nmol/L in the FP, SP and CP groups, respectively. Only in FP and SP groups, serum iPTH concentrations decreased approximately 13.5% and 14.5%, respectively. Visceral fat also showed a significant decrement in FP (-1.05±1.4%; p=<0.001) and SP (-0.96±1.7%; p=0.006). Serum LDL-C concentration showed a within-group reduction in FP (-10.4±11.2 mg/dL; p <0.001) and an insignificant decrement in SP (-6.6±20.2 mg/dL; p=0.083). Serum HDL increased in both vitamin D supplemented groups (FP: 9.7±7.6 vs. SP: 5.7±6.7 mg/dL; p<0.001).

CONCLUSION: Vitamin D-fortified bread could be a potentially effective in raising circulating 25(OH)D of the population to nearly adequate levels.
