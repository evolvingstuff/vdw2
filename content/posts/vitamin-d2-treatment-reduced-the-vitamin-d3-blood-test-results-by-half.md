Context: It has been reported that vitamin D2 supplements are less effective than vitamin D3 and that vitamin D2 supplements may increase the degradation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3.]</span>

Objective: Our objective was to examine the effect of 50,000 IU vitamin D2 supplementation in a clinical setting on serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 <span>[25(OH)D2]</span> and 25(OH)D3.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study performed in an urban tertiary referral hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. 

48 patients who had been started on 50,000 IU vitamin D2 repletion and maintenance programs were identified through a search of our electronic medical record. 

Baseline and follow-up total serum 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were compared.

Results: The mean baseline total 25(OH)D was 31.0 ± 10.6 ng/ml and rose to 48.3 ± 13.4 ng/ml after treatment (p=<0.001).

25(OH)D2 increased from 4.2 ± 4.3 ng/ml to 34.6 ± 12.3 ng/ml after treatment (p<0.001) for an average of 158 days (range 35-735). 

 **Serum 25(OH)D3 decreased from 26.8 ± 10.8 ng/ml to 13.7 ± 7.9 g/ml (p<0.001).** 

Conclusions: 50,000IU vitamin D2 repletion and maintenance therapy substantially increased total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D2 despite a decrease in serum 25(OH)D3. 

This treatment program is an appropriate and effective strategy to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.
