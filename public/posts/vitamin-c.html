Statistics show that people over 60 face a 50% chance of developing cancer. Prior to 1900, this disease didn’t even make the top ten. Today, it touches almost all families. The chemical industry got into full swing after World War II, so did the cancer rate. Coincidence?</p><p>In 1971, over a half million Americans fell victim to cancer, with 280,000 succumbing to the disease within a year. Fast forward to 2022, and a staggering 1.9 million cases emerged, claiming over 600,000 lives.</p><p>Organized Western medicine’s approach to treating this disease hasn’t changed in over 100 years. It’s all about drugs, surgery, and radiation. Success in treating cancer with these methods has overall been a dismal failure. The typical life of a cancer patient is filled with misery and pain. The average cost for cancer treatment in the US today is approaching $200,000, and can go much higher depending on the type of cancer. And, that doesn’t include loss of wages or the burden on family for home care.</p><p><strong>One thing for certain, cancer depletes the body of vitamin C that is concentrated in the immune cells. Immune cells depleted of vitamin C cannot effectively help fight cancer.</strong> Humans are unable to replenish vitamin C internally, we typically rely exclusively on our diet for vitamin C. Diet alone cannot optimize vitamin C levels.</p><p>Visualize vitamin C levels on a scale from “0% to 100%” as it concentrates in the blood, cells, and organs of the body. Animals are always at 100% due to their ability to convert glucose into vitamin C in addition to the amount they obtain from their food automatically. Humans and apes on the other hand get their vitamin C exclusively from food alone. Apes and monkeys live in the tropics where their vitamin C rich food source (fruits and plants) is available year around. So, their concentration of vitamin C in their blood, cells, and organs is around 85%, enough to keep them in reasonable health.</p><p>Humans on the other hand oscillate between 5-30% of vitamin C concentration. It’s a condition called hypoascorbemia (low levels of vitamin C). At the bottom end of the scale it’s called <strong>subclinical scurvy</strong> , just before full blown scurvy symptoms. That’s why humans are highly susceptible to diseases and infections. Interestingly, it’s only humans and apes that catch colds.</p><p>Vitamin C supplements are inexpensive, effective, and non-toxic in any amount.The fix for this low level of vitamin C has been widely available ever since Linus Pauling wrote his first book “Vitamin C and the Common Cold” in the 1970’s. Then, the propaganda campaign orchestrated by the medical/pharmaceutical industry got into full swing. Their goal is to create doubt about vitamin C’s effectiveness, and distort and lie about health risks. Vitamin C is a serious threat to profits of the sick care industry.</p><p>To only take vitamin C at the start of a cold or flu to shorten duration and severity, is to miss out on the health promoting properties of this vital nutrient including cancer prevention and treatment. In order to get into the 85-100% saturation range and reap the health promoting benefits of vitamin C, optimal dosing is imperative.</p><p>Cancer starts as a damaged cell that no longer functions the way a healthy cell is programmed to do by nature. The immune system can typically identify these rogue cells and destroy and eliminate them before they multiply and become a well-established cancer. A healthy and robust immune system is essential for this task. Without vitamin C the immune system operates at suboptimal efficiency. Kind of like not providing a soldier with enough bullets to get the job done.</p><p>The immune system is your protector and healer. For the immune system to function at its peak, optimal nutrition (especially optimizing vitamin C), is a must. For modern humans of today, optimal nutrition cannot be achieved without supplementation. We do not get the full complement of vitamins and minerals from our diet due to nutrient depletion in processed and cooked foods.</p><p>All animals, except humans, eat fresh, ripe, and raw food, thus ensuring all nutrients, macro (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) and micro (vitamins and minerals), are there for their bodies to utilize. Vitamins and minerals are essential substances for all life to survive and thrive. An undernourished body cannot maintain optimal health.</p><p>Think of all the trillions of cells in the body as each one having its own engine to perform the work it is programmed to do. The engine needs oxygen and food as fuel to keep performing its task. Think of the vitamins and minerals as the nuts, bolts, and screws, that hold the engine together and allow it to keep running smoothly. Without all these small pieces the cell cannot function properly. <strong>An extra benefit of vitamin C is that it detoxifies the cells of harmful toxins, chemicals and poisons</strong> that gum up the works.</p><p>Although cancer can and does affect humans at all stages of life, it’s most prevalent after 60. The normal decline of the effectiveness of the immune system due to age is quite obvious. Based on studies and observations we humans all have the potential to live an independent, healthy, and vibrant life, until around 90 years. Thereafter, assistance from caregivers, family or otherwise, becomes the norm.</p><p>Life on earth is a one-time go-around. If you have family and friends to enjoy, it’s worth living. If your body is filled with sickness, pain, and misery, there is not much enjoyment to be had. To achieve, and maintain, an independent, healthy lifestyle, you must become proactive and prioritize health and wellness.</p><p>Practically all animals on this planet make their own vitamin C and lots of it. The few species of animals that don’t make their own vitamin C (apes and monkeys) all live in the tropics where vitamin C-rich vegetation is available to them year-round. Humans also evolved in the tropics until they left to populate the rest of the world. <strong>Chronic deficiency of vitamin C is at the root of immune system failure</strong> . Cancer cannot be stopped or treated without a well-functioning immune system.</p><p>Reports of many chemicals being labeled as cancer-causing when ingested in excess amounts are continuously being posted in the media. There are many thousands of foreign chemicals that humans are exposed to every day from our air, water, and food. Most man-made chemicals have the potential to cause damage to cells and turn a healthy cell into a cancer cell.</p><p>There are different paths you can take to address a cancer threat. The most favorite is do nothing and just believe in Que Sera, Sera, (whatever will be, will be). With this choice your chance of dying of or with cancer is very high. This approach is favored by the medical establishment. More often than not when cancer is diagnosed its attributed to bad luck or bad genes. Doctors are typically not trained and are not knowledgeable about any other complementary therapies. When you get a diagnosis of cancer, you will then be referred to an oncologist to get the latest chemo, surgery, or radiation treatment. More often than not, all three.</p><p>Patients entering a hospital for treatment of disease conditions always test extremely low or are entirely depleted of vitamin C. Vitamin C is a substance critical to the proper functioning of the immune system. A healthy and robust immune system can destroy cancer at an early stage as well as retard the growth of established tumors.</p><p>Since vitamin C is non-toxic in any amounts, you have nothing to lose taking enough vitamin C to be disease free, especially from cancer. Most cancers are slow growing, so there is no need for immediate heroic intervention. Investigate options, get second opinions, try natural approaches since your body is programmed to be a healer if all essential nutrients are available and damaging chemicals and other toxins toxins are removed.</p><p>Watch this video for a sample of vitamin C’s effectiveness,</p><p><a href="https://walterstanley.substack.com/p/cancer-prevention-and-treatment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1870924&amp;post_id=142308753&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=ofo3r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">14 minute</a></p><hr><h5 id=asked-perplexity-ai-about-associations-of-vitamin-c-and-cancer---march-2024httpswwwperplexityaisearchwhat-are-the-2isjagx8sseljjar4gheag>Asked <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-are-the-2iSjAGx8SseLjJar4GheAg>Perplexity AI about associations of Vitamin C and Cancer - March 2024</a></h5><p>highlight - Meta-analysis: 2X decrease of many cancers when taking high-dose vitamin C</p><ul><li><p>Epidemiologic evidence suggests a protective effect of vitamin C for non-hormone-dependent cancers, with studies showing significant protection and high intake conferring approximately a twofold protective effect compared with low intake.

We aimed to review the evidence for exogenous vitamin C as a neuroprotective agent. MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane library databases were searched from inception to May 2020. Pre-clinical and clinical reports evaluating vitamin C for acute neurological injury were included. Twenty-two pre-clinical and 11 clinical studies were eligible for inclusion. Pre-clinical studies included models of traumatic and hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The median <span>[IQR]</span> maximum daily dose of vitamin C in animal studies was 120 <span>[50-500]</span> mg/kg. Twenty-one animal studies reported improvements in biomarkers, functional outcome or both. Clinical studies included single reports in neonatal hypoxic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage and eight studies in ischemic stroke. The median maximum daily dose of vitamin C was 750 <span>[500-1000]</span> mg, or ~10 mg/kg for an average size adult male. Apart from one case series of intra-cisternal vitamin C administration in subarachnoid hemorrhage, clinical studies reported no patient centered benefit. While pre-clinical trials suggest that exogenous vitamin C improves biomarkers of neuroprotection, functional outcome and mortality, these results have not translated to humans.</p><p><strong>However, clinical trials used ~1/10th of the vitamin C dose of animal studies.</strong></p><hr><h4 id=the-role-of-vitamin-c-in-two-distinct-physiological-states-physical-activity-and-sleep---dec-2020>The Role of Vitamin C in Two Distinct Physiological States: Physical Activity and Sleep - Dec 2020</h4><p>Nutrients, 20 Dec 2020, 12(12) DOI: 10.3390/nu12123908 <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/the-role-of-vitamin-c-in-two-distinct-physiological-states---physical-activity-and-sleep.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p><p>Otocka-Kmiecik A1, Król A1</p><p>This paper is a literature overview of the complex relationship between vitamin C and two opposing physiological states, physical activity and sleep.

Only studies with valid classifications of sepsis and intravenous vitamin C treatment (alone or combined with hydrocortisone/thiamine) were included.</p><p>Results</p><p>A total of 17 studies including 3133 patients fulfilled the predefined criteria and were analyzed. Pooled analysis indicated no mortality reduction in patients treated with vitamin C when compared to reference (risk difference - 0.05 <span>[95% CI - 0.11 to - 0.01]</span>; p = 0.08; p for Cochran Q = 0.002; I2 = 56%). Notably, subgroup analyses revealed an improved survival, if vitamin C treatment was applied for 3-4 days (risk difference, - 0.10 <span>[95% CI - 0.19 to - 0.02]</span>; p = 0.02) when compared to patients treated for 1-2 or > 5 days. Also, timing of the pooled mortality assessment indicated a reduction concerning short-term mortality (&lt; 30 days; risk difference, - 0.08 <span>[95% CI - 0.15 to - 0.01]</span>; p = 0.02; p for Cochran Q = 0.02; I2 = 63%). Presence of statistical heterogeneity was noted with no sign of significant publication bias.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Although vitamin C administration did not reduce pooled mortality, patients may profit if vitamin C is administered over 3 to 4 days. Consequently, further research is needed to identify patient subgroups that might benefit from intravenous supplementation of vitamin C.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-c-and-immune-function---nov-2017>Vitamin C and Immune Function - Nov 2017</h4><p>Nutrients 2017, 9(11), 1211; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9111211>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9111211</a> <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-c-and-immune-function.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p><p>Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient for humans, with pleiotropic functions related to its ability to donate electrons. It is a potent antioxidant and a cofactor for a family of biosynthetic and gene regulatory enzymes. Vitamin C contributes to immune defense by supporting various cellular functions of both the innate and adaptive immune system. Vitamin C supports epithelial barrier function against pathogens and promotes the oxidant scavenging activity of the skin, thereby potentially protecting against environmental oxidative stress. Vitamin C accumulates in phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils, and can enhance chemotaxis, phagocytosis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and ultimately microbial killing. It is also needed for apoptosis and clearance of the spent neutrophils from sites of infection by macrophages, thereby decreasing necrosis/NETosis and potential tissue damage. The role of vitamin C in lymphocytes is less clear, but it has been shown to enhance differentiation and proliferation of B- and T-cells, likely due to its gene regulating effects. Vitamin C deficiency results in impaired immunity and higher susceptibility to infections. In turn, infections significantly impact on vitamin C levels due to enhanced inflammation and metabolic requirements. Furthermore, supplementation with vitamin C appears to be able to both prevent and treat respiratory and systemic infections. Prophylactic prevention of infection requires dietary vitamin C intakes that provide at least adequate, if not saturating plasma levels (i.e., 100–200 mg/day), which optimize cell and tissue levels. In contrast, treatment of established infections requires significantly higher (gram) doses of the vitamin to compensate for the increased inflammatory response and metabolic demand.</p><hr><h4 id=special-issue-on-vitamin-c-in-nutrients---2017--15-studies>Special issue on Vitamin C in Nutrients - 2017 (15 studies)</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients/special_issues/vitamin_c_health_disease>URL for Special Issue</a> FREE PDFs</strong></p><ul><li><p>Inadequate Vitamin C Status in Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Associations with Glycaemic Control, Obesity, and Smoking</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C Intake is Inversely Associated with Cardiovascular Mortality in a Cohort of Spanish Graduates: the SUN Project</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C Status Correlates with Markers of Metabolic and Cognitive Health in 50-Year-Olds: Findings of the CHALICE Cohort Study</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C Depletion and All-Cause Mortality in Renal Transplant Recipients</p></li><li><p>Emerging Evidence on Neutrophil Motility Supporting Its Usefulness to Define Vitamin C Intake Requirements</p></li><li><p>Poor Vitamin C Status Late in Pregnancy Is Associated with Increased Risk of Complications in Type 1 Diabetic Women: A Cross-Sectional Study</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C and Immune Function</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C Status and Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review</p></li><li><p>The Roles of Vitamin C in Skin Health</p></li><li><p>Protective Role for Antioxidants in Acute Kidney Disease</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C, Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease</p></li><li><p>Does Vitamin C Influence Neurodegenerative Diseases and Psychiatric Disorders?</p></li><li><p>Vitamin C and Infections</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=vitamin-c-consumption-has-decreased>Vitamin C consumption has decreased</h4><p><strong>Trends in Vitamin C Consumption in the United States:1999–2018 <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/trends-in-vitamin-c-consumption-in-the-united-states-1999-2018.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p><ul><li><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/trends-vit-c.jpg alt=image width=600></li></ul><hr><h4 id=vitamin-c-books-have-not-looked-at-them>Vitamin C books (have not looked at them)</h4><ul><li><p>Vitamin C: The Real Story, the Remarkable and Controversial Healing Factor Paperback – Oct, 2015 Andrew W.
