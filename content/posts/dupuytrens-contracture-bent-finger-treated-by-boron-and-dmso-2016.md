#### Dupuytren's treated by founder of VitaminDWiki

 **I, Henry Lahore, had a personal interest in Dupuytren's** 

* Have had level 2 Dupuytren's for about 5 years (age 65-70) 

   * Dupuytren's is pronounced as du-pwe-TRANZ

* It was starting to create some pain in right little finger

* Laying my hands palms down on a table I could raise th left little finger about 2" high, but virtually 0" for the right finger

* Tried various things over a period of a month but now have a combination which, for me, has eliminated the pain and allows raising the right finger about 1" above the table

 **My experiments (starting with a high level of Vitamin D and Magnesium)** 

I tried Laser Therapy daily for ` week - no response

I tried 10 mg of Boron daily orally for 2 weeks - no response

I added Topical Boric Acid in DMOS  **once a day**  for a few days - no response

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: I buy a cream: 70% pure dmso & 30% aloe vera from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z7KME/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had tried DMSO oil and gel, but prefer the cream form

I increased Topical Boric Acid in DMSO to 3 times a day- WORKED in about 1 week

&nbsp; &nbsp;  reduced by at least 70% tightness in the tendons to my right pinky finger

I realize that it could have just taken a while for the Boron benefits to be seen, and that topical may not have been needed.

 **Update Nov 8, 2016** 

I failed to apply the Topical Boron yesterday - even once

The DP pain came back in the middle of the night

I massaged in the Topical Boron. Pain was gone bone hour later and did not come back

 **Update Nov 10, 2016** 

Forgot again to apply the Topical Boron

Pain came back again, again it was gone 30 minutes after application

 **Update Nov 11, 2016** 

Have added Magnesium Chloride to the Boric Acid in the DMSO - still to be applied topically 3 times a day

 **Update Nov 13, 2016** 

Well now, that did not work!

Hand ached all of Nov 12.

Suspect that there was less Boron in the DMSO slurry due to having the MgCl

I have switched back to Boron + DMSO.  No pain again

I have also purchased 1 lb of Boric Acid crystals from Amazon

Realized that I had been applying approximately 1 milligram of topical Boron at a time

Going to make my own Boric acid solution and see what happens when I apply 3 or so mg at a time.

 **Update Nov 18, 2016** 

My DMSO now has about 3 milligrams per application (using Boric Acid crystals)

I massage the mixture on my palm just 2 times per day - no pain anytime during the day or night

 **Update Dec 5, 2016** 

My wife is now also using Boron for her level 1 Dupuytren’s Contracture

She is leaving the Boron on the palm longer by putting on a plastic glove.

and massaging the Boron in for another 10 minutes while doing other things

 **Update Feb 15, 2017** 

Internal 10 mg Boron daily and,

DMSO + Boron or Mg topically applied every 2-3 days when there is a slight Dupuytren’s pain

Have not yet tried just DMSO - without Boron or Magnesium

 **Update Dec 2018** 

My Dupuytren’s has been completely gone.- I no longer put anything on my hands

I have taken Boron, Magnesium and Vitamin D as part of my daily supplements for several years now

My wife's Dupuytren’s is <10% of original, no pain. She uses topical Boron nightly, no daily oral Boron

I suggested Boron to a Facebook Dupuytren's forum - got a great response

Based on responses by my myself, my wife, and those on Facebook I will suggest that a person try

1. Massage [DMSO cream - Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z7KME/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) diluted with [Boric Acid - Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FL44WI6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) water and [Magnesium Chloride - Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YQGLW38/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

> Initially more than once per day

> As Dupuytren’s decreases drop back to several times per week

1. Supplement your diet with 

> Boric/Boric Acid (10 mg daily seems to work), 

> Magnesium (probably 100 mg is enough of the element)

> Vitamin D (probably 4,000 IU is enough)

I made saturated solutions of the Boric and Magnesium compounds by adding the compounds in hot water until they no longer dissolve

&nbsp; &nbsp; and then let them cool and pour off the saturated liquids

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stir in a little bit of the liquids (say 1 teaspoon of each) into the DMSO cream to be used (perhaps 2 tablespoons)

 **Update Jan 2020** : 

During the past 4 years I find that I need to apply the liquid/cream topically about 4 times per year. 

The pain reminds me, then, after a single treatment the pain is gone for 3 months. 

However, my wife uses it every night.  Takesher  about a years to use up 4 ounces of cream

#### DMSO with/without other ingredients has been used for Dupuytren's for many decades

 **Examples from the web** 

* [Dupuytren Contacture and DMSO](http://dupuytrens-contracture.com/dupuytren-contracture-treatment-options/dupuytren-contacture-dmso/) - Dupuytrens Contracture Institute

> "Most therapeutic benefits of DMSO are documented in connective tissue diseases in particular, such as Dupuytrens contracture, scleroderma, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, and muscle injury.(1-3) The AMA is among this group of supporters of DMSO for these applications. Multiple research suggests that DMSO applied over the afflicted region may soften the abnormal connective tissue associated with disorders such as Dupuytren’s contracture of the hand, Peyronie’s disease, scleroderma and keloids.(4)"

> They have a product which adds vitamin E, methyl salicylate and urea

#### Review of Dupuytren's, fascia, and Vitamin D - Jan 2022

 **Vitamin D Status in Dupuytren’s Disease: Association with Clinical Status and Vitamin D Receptor Expression** 

 **Results** 

Vitamin D concentrations were signi¦cantly lower in patients than healthy controls. In addition, total

extension de¦cit of involved ¦ngers was higher in vitamin D de¦cient patients. Moreover, a positive

correlation was found between vitamin D levels and expression of VDR in pathologic fascia in patients

undergoing fasciectomy for contracture. Serum vitamin D levels were found to be low in DD patients.

Expression of VDR was lower in the vitamin D de¦cient group.

#### Dupuytren's and Boron

* [Dupuytren’s Contracture also known as Viking Disease or Celtic Hands](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dupuytrens-contracture-also-known-viking-disease-celtic-alan-russell?trk=mp-author-card) Dr. Alan Russell Sept 2015

> "Treatment in the past has been varied and ranged from radiation therapy, surgery, or collagenase injections , none of which have been effective or curative"

> "In the Fall of 2014 the patient started to take Boron in the form of   **calcium fructoborate**  containing 3 mg of Boron   **twice per day** . After a few months the patient noticed no progression and over the ensuing months to August 2015 her hand has steadily improved. "

> Dr. Russell is a main reason of my interest in [Boron](/categories/vitamin-d-and-boron)

#### Dupuytren's prevelance: range of 4 to 1 around the world: Wonder why?

Perhaps something which is not in the water, such as Boron, Magnesium

The variation does not appear to be associated with latitude

#### Dupuytren's vs age and country

#### Origin of the term, genetics of the disease

[The Baron's complaint](https://investigativegenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-2223-2-18) PubMed Aug 2011

" . . .Baron Guillaume Dupuytren was a French physician, and Napoleon Bonaparte's doctor."

9 genes are associated - the strongest gene association increases incidence by only 2 times

Unsure if it is the "Viking's disease"

#### Wikipedia - Dupuytren's risk factors

 **[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)** 

Dupuytren's contracture is a non-specific affliction, but primarily affects:

People of Scandinavian or Northern European ancestry;<sup>[11]</sup> it has been called the "Viking disease",<sup>[6]</sup> though it is also widespread in some Mediterranean countries (e.g., Spain and Bosnia).<sup>[12]</sup> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dupuytren's is unusual among ethnic groups such as Chinese and Africans.<sup>[13]</sup>

Men rather than women (men are more likely to develop the condition).<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[11]</sup>

People over the age of 50; the likelihood of getting Dupuytren's disease increases with age.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[13]</sup>

Smokers, especially those who smoke 25 cigarettes or more a day.<sup>[13]</sup><sup>[14]</sup>

Thinner people (i.e. those with a lower than average body mass index).<sup>[13]</sup>

People with a higher than average fasting blood glucose level.<sup>[13]</sup>

Manual workers.<sup>[13]</sup>

People with previous hand injury.<sup>[4]</sup>

People with a family history (60% to 70% of those afflicted have a genetic predisposition to Dupuytren's contracture).<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[15]</sup>

People with Ledderhose disease.<sup>[4]</sup>

Alcoholics.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[14]</sup>

People with epilepsy (possibly due to anti-convulsive medication).<sup>[16]</sup>

People with diabetes mellitus.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[16]</sup>

People with HIV.<sup>[6]</sup>
