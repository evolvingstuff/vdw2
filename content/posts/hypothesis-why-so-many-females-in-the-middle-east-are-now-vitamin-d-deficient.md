**Based on reading about dress codes for women and recently seeing the movie [Wadjda](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2258858/) , which is set in Saudia Arabia** 

1. Dress codes started when living in tribes and women may have only needed to cover themselves when there were outside male visitors

> Plenty of access to the sun most of the time

1. Dress codes continued when people moved to cities

> Women still got vitamin D in courtyards or rooftops - not wear excessive clothes when men from the family could not see them

> Even being in the shade the women would get about 1/3 the amount of vitamin D/hour

1. Air conditioning became prevalent in the last portion of the 20th century, allowing people to escape the heat

> Rate of Multiple Sclerosis in women has gone up <a href="/posts/6x-in-the-past-30-years" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4111">6X in the past 30 years</a> in Tehran (MS is strongly related to lack of vitamin D)

1. Predict that [rickets](/categories/rickets) will make its appearance soon in the Middle East 

> Turkey managed to <a href="/posts/reduce-rate-of-rickets-by-60x" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1675">reduce rate of rickets by 60X</a> by giving 400 IU of vitamin D to EVERY child
