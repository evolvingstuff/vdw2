#### Second article: Noticed vitamin D level low after resuscitation following heart failure  
Concluded that the 35% decrease in vitamin D was due to increase in amount of blood, not because the body was using vitamin D.

ABSTRACT : INTRODUCTION : Recent reports have highlighted the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and suggested an association with excess mortality in critically ill patients. Serum vitamin D concentrations in these studies were measured following resuscitation. It is unclear whether aggressive fluid resuscitation independently influences serum vitamin D. METHODS : Nineteen patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were studied. Serum 25(OH)D3, 1?,25(OH)2D3, parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ionised calcium were measured at five defined timepoints: T1 - baseline, T2 - 5 minutes after onset of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (time of maximal fluid effect), T3 - on return to the intensive care unit, T4 - 24 hrs after surgery and T5 - 5 days after surgery. Linear mixed models were used to compare measures at T2-T5 with baseline measures. 

RESULTS : Acute fluid loading resulted in a  **35% reduction in 25(OH)D3**  (59 ± 16 to 38 ± 14 nmol/L, P < 0.0001) and a 45% reduction in 1?,25(OH)2D3 (99 ± 40 to 54 ± 22 pmol/L P < 0.0001) and i(Ca) (P < 0.01), with elevation in parathyroid hormone (P < 0.0001). Serum 25(OH)D3 returned to baseline only at T5 while 1?,25(OH)2D3 demonstrated an overshoot above baseline at T5 (P < 0.0001). There was a delayed rise in CRP at T4 and T5; this was not associated with a reduction in vitamin D levels at these time points. 

CONCLUSIONS : Hemodilution significantly lowers serum 25(OH)D3 and 1?,25(OH)2D3, which may take up to 24 hours to resolve. Moreover, delayed overshoot of 1?,25(OH)2D3 needs consideration. We urge caution in interpreting serum vitamin D in critically ill patients in the context of major resuscitation, and would advocate repeating the measurement once the effects of the resuscitation have abated.
