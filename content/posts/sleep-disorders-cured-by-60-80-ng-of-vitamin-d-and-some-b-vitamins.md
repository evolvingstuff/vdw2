### A few of Dr. Gominak's slides,   
all slides are attached at the bottom of this page

### What’s the right dose?

* We make 20,000 IU of vitamin D on our skin in 1-6 hours in a bathing suit, middle of the day middle of the summer. 

* Time needed to accomplish this is related to skin color. 

* 1,000 IU/day is clearly not going to replace this.

* There are two types of doses :

   * 1) Repleating dose ( going from 15 ng/ml  to 65 ng/ml ) and

   * 2) Maintenance dose (staying at 65ng/ml)

* The one time dose to go from 18 to 60 is much higher than the maintenance dose. 

* Repleating dose is 10-20K/day for 4-6 weeks depending on the first measured level and, what month it’s measured in, and how long it’s been that low.

### Dosing vitamin D

* Summer dose is zero to 10,000 and different for each person based on where they live, how much they go outside and how fast they make it, ie skin color.

* Dark skinned people make it slower, they are made for very high sun environment and use melanin in their skin to block D formation so they don’t get too high.

*  **We know that darker skinned people have more sleep disorders, this is why.** 

* Each person needs to learn their own winter dose and summer dose that keeps them 60-80 ng/ml. 

### Dosing vitamin D

* Surprisingly, once my patients wake up strong, happy and pain free for several months they can often tell by the way they feel that their level isn’t right.

*  **When they feel worse they decrease or increase by half of their dose.** 

*  **If, within a day or so, they’re feeling  good again it usually  means they went the right way.** 

* Always insist on numbers to support these moves in the first to second year. After that they may not need to be done as often.

* All insurances will do four vitamin D levels per year with the ICD 9 of 268.9; vitamin D deficiency.  All of your patients make that diagnosis so don’t be afraid to use it. 

### Other vitamin deficiencies that affect sleep may develop after long periods of D deficiency

* D hormone has other cofactors that are necessary for its action in each cell, so I always give a multivitamin.

* B12 helps the sleep and should be >500. If it’s below 500 I supplement with 1000 mcg per day for several years.

* D has receptors in the parietal cells of the stomach that make acid and intrinsic factor so B12 deficiency is usually a secondary deficiency to D deficiency and what we’ve been taught about “pernicious anemia” is actually wrong,  **once you replace the D as well as the B12 the anemia usually corrects.** 

* Anemia of “chronic disease” always has a low D level in the background, and in my experience usually corrects with the proper vitamin D replacement, 60-80 ng/ml.

* All the cells of the bone marrow, including red cells and platelets have vitamin D receptors on their surface.

### Vitamin D side effects

* Leg cramps or  worsening headaches may suggest magnesium is low, give sunflower or pumpkin seeds as a magnesium source daily or take magnesium gluconate 500 mg/day. (not oxide) send them to www.vitamindcouncil.org. for any questions.

* If D causes diarrhea (1/50 of my patients) put the D on the skin instead of orally for a while or try the powdered form instead of D dissolved in oil. Or carefully use a tanning bed.

* Be careful of giving supplemental D to people who are not sick. They may not need it and if it gets too high it will goof up their sleep. 

* If they feel worse immediately lower the dose.

### In the third year of giving lots of patients vitamin D some questions remain

* Why are some of my daily headache sufferers developing burning in their hands and feet?

* Why don’t all of the patients who came to see me for burning in the hands and feet get completely better with D?

* Why do some vitamin D deficient patients have pain and some do not?

* Why are some people cured of pain using D and some not?

* Why haven’t the irritable bowel symptoms gone away even though the reflux has?

* Why aren’t my patients losing weight at the rate that they gained it when they became D deficient?

* Why are some of my patients still not sleeping normally with everything I know of in range?

* What is it that their brain still wants to sleep normally?

### Why do all of these people have “abnormal colonic microbiomes”?

* Hypertension

* Heart disease

* High cholesterol

* Obesity

* Stroke

> (All who we know have sleep apnea and low D)

* Multiple Sclerosis

* Rheumatoid arthritis

* Psoriasis

* Ulcerative colitis,  crohn’s 

* Lupus

* Autoimmune diseases of almost any kind
