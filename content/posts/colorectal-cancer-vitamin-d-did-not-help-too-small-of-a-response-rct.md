A personalized vitamin D3 loading dose has not yet been tested in cancer patients. This interim analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled VICTORIA trial analyzed the first recruited 74 German adults with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer, a tumor surgery within the past year, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) < 50 nmol/L. Study participants received a loading dose tailored for a baseline 25(OH)D level and BMI in the first 11 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 2000 IU of vitamin D3 daily until end of trial week 12. The mean 25(OH)D levels were 27.6, 31.0, and 34.1 nmol/L in the placebo group and 25.9, 63.1, and 75.5 nmol/L in the verum group during screening, visit 1 (end of loading dose), and visit 2 (end of maintenance dose), respectively. The prevalence of 25(OH)D) â‰¥ 50 nmol/L at visits 1 and 2 was 3.5% and 17.4% in the placebo group and 80.0% and 100% in the verum group. No events of 25(OH)D > 150 nmol/L or hypercalcemia were observed. Hypercalciuria events at visit 1 (n = 5 in verum and n = 1 in the placebo group; p = 0.209) receded after discontinuation of the study medication. The personalized loading dose effectively and safely increased the 25(OH)D levels, and 2000 IU of vitamin D3 daily sustained the achieved levels.
