The classical treatment of ADHD, where stimulant medication is used, has revealed severe side effects and intolerance. Consequently, the demand to search for alternative treatment has increased rapidly. When comparing levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) in ADHD patients with those in age-matching controls, lower levels are found in ADHD patients&rsquo; blood. ω-3 PUFAs are essential nutrients and necessary for proper brain function and development. Additionally, there are strong indications that ω-3 PUFA supplements could have beneficial effects on ADHD. However, the results of ω-3 PUFA supplementation studies show high variability. Therefore, we reviewed recent studies published between 2000 and 2015 to identify effective treatment combinations, the quality of design, and the safety and tolerability of ω-3-containing food supplements. We searched the databases MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science with keywords such as &ldquo;ADHD&rdquo; and &ldquo;ω-3/6 PUFA&rdquo; and identified 25 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>The results of these ω-3 PUFA studies are contradictory but, overall, show evidence for successful treatment of ADHD symptoms. The tolerability of the given supplements was high, and only mild side effects were reported.</p><p>In conclusion, there is evidence that a ω-3 PUFA treatment has a positive effect on ADHD. It should be added that treatment could be more effective in patients with mild forms of ADHD. Moreover, the dosage of stimulant medication could be reduced when used in combination with ω-3 PUFA supplements. Further studies are necessary to investigate underlying mechanisms that can lead to a reduction of ADHD symptoms due to ω-3 PUFA treatments and also to determine the optimal concentrations of ω-3 PUFAs, whether used as a single treatment or in combination with other medication.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/omega-3-adhd.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=half-of-adhd-children-treated-by-span-stylecolor00fomega-3span-rct2009>Half of ADHD children treated by <span style=color:#00f>Omega-3</span> RCT 2009</h4><p><strong>Omega-3/Omega-6 Fatty Acids for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial in Children and Adolescents</strong></p><p>Journal of Attention Disorders March 2009 vol. 12 no. 5 394-401</p><p>Objective: The aim of the study was to assess omega 3/6 fatty acids (eye q) in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Participants were randomly allocated to receive both vitamin D (50,000 IU/week) plus <strong>magnesium (6 mg/kg/day)</strong> supplements (n = 33) or placebos (n = 33) for 8 weeks.

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Science and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science and Humanities (Web of Science), ClincalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for RCTs in January 2019. Independently, two authors (J.G., T.X.) extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, combined the data, and graded evidence quality using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Our primary outcomes were assessed through rating scales of ADHD severity. Secondary outcomes measured were the possible adverse effects of vitamin D supplementation and vitamin D status after supplementation for ADHD.</p><p>Results: We included four RCTs with 256 children addressing vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation demonstrated a small but statistically significant improvement in ADHD total scores, inattention scores, hyperactivity scores, and behavior scores. The improvement was likely limited due to the low to very low quality of evidence in the literature. There was no statistically significant improvement in oppositional scores. Reported adverse events in the vitamin D group were mild and not significantly different from the control group. Vitamin D supplementation increased serum vitamin D levels and the ratio of patients with sufficient vitamin D levels.</p><p>Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to methylphenidate appeared to reduce ADHD symptoms without serious adverse events associated with improved vitamin D status. However, considering the generally low strength of evidence, well-designed RCTs are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation for both children and adults with ADHD, especially in the setting of a combination of vitamin D and other ADHD treatments.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/adhd-vita-d-meta-2019-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=adhd-helped-somewhat-by-omega-3-in-8-weeks---sept2022>ADHD helped somewhat by Omega-3 in 8 weeks - Sept 2022</h4><p><strong>Impulsiveness in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder after an 8-week intervention with the Mediterranean diet and/or omega-3 fatty acids: a randomized clinical trial</strong></p><p>Neurología Vol 37, Issue 7, Sept 2022, Pages 513-523 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.09.009>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrleng.2019.09.009</a></p><p>San Mauro Martin a, S.

Impulsiveness has been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study assesses the progression of impulsive behavior in children with ADHD after an 8-week dietary intervention with the Mediterranean diet and/or omega-3 fatty acid supplementation by using a version of the 11-item BIS adapted for children (BIS-11c).</p><p>Methods</p><p>This cross-sectional study includes 60 children with ADHD from the region of Madrid, Spain. Participants were divided into 4 groups, with one control group and 3 intervention groups (Mediterranean diet, omega-3 supplementation, and Mediterranean diet plus omega-3 supplementation). A personalized Mediterranean diet was designed for members of groups 2 and 4. The BIS-11c was administered to determine the level of impulsiveness, and the KIDMED test was used to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet.</p><p>Results</p><p>The supplementation group showed a fairly significant decrease in the total BIS-11c (P = .049). Total cognitive score slightly decreased in the diet and supplementation groups. Only the control group showed a considerable decrease in the total motor score. Total non planning scores were lower in all groups after the intervention. Baseline and final BIS-11c scores were positively correlated with treatments (r > 0.9).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>An intake of 550 mg EPA fatty acid and 225 mg DHA fatty acid per day for 8 weeks is associated with less marked impulsive behavior in children with ADHD. A Mediterranean diet may improve BIS scores, although our results are not conclusive in this population.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/adhd-impulseiness.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>Note: This study does not even contain the phrase &ldquo;Omega-6&rdquo;.

Maternal urine and serum samples were collected during all three trimesters to measure the urinary concentrations of 43 antibiotics (including two metabolites) and the serum vitamin D levels. The ADHD symptoms of preschoolers were assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual–oriented ADHD problems scale in the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist.

However, there are no prospective studies addressing this hypothesis. We aimed to examine whether maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy is associated with the risk of ADHD-like symptoms in offspring.</p><p>METHODS: We conducted a prospective study analyzing data from 1,650 mother-child pairs from five birth cohorts embedded in the INMA Project (Spain, 1997-2008). Maternal vitamin D status in pregnancy was estimated by measuring plasma concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3]</span> at 13 weeks of gestation. Children were assessed by teachers for ADHD-like symptoms at ages 4-5 years using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ADHD form list.</p><p>RESULTS: After adjustment, the number of total ADHD-like symptoms in children decreased by 11% per 10 ng/ml increment of maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration (incidence rate ratio <span>[IRR]</span> = 0.89; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 0.80, 0.98). Similarly, the number of symptoms in the ADHD subscales decreased in relation to higher maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration (IRR per 10 ng/ml increment = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79, 0.99 for the inattention scale; and IRR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.99 for the hyperactivity-impulsivity scale). Using diagnostic criteria, we found an association between increasing maternal 25(OH)D3 with a lower risk of ADHD DSM-IV (relative risk ratio per 10 ng/ml increment = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.72, 1.06) and ICD-10 hyperkinetic disorder (relative risk ratio = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.49, 1.04) in children.</p><p>CONCLUSION: Higher maternal circulating levels of 25(OH)D3 in pregnancy are associated with a lower risk of developing ADHD-like symptoms in childhood.</p><hr><h4 id=adhd-decreased-by-11-for-every-4-ng-higher-level-of-vitamin-d-in-the-cord-at-birth--2016>ADHD decreased by 11% for every 4 ng higher level of vitamin D in the cord at birth - 2016</h4><p><strong>Inverse associations between cord vitamin D and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms: A child cohort study.</strong></p><p>Aust N Z J Psychiatry. 2016 Sep 30. pii: 0004867416670013.</p><p>Mossin MH1, Aaby JB1, Dalgård C2, Lykkedegn S3, Christesen HT3, Bilenberg N4.</p><p>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between cord 25-hydroxyvitamin D2+3 (25(OH)D) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in toddlers, using the Child Behaviour Checklist for ages 1.5-5.</p><p>METHOD: In a population-based birth cohort, a Child Behaviour Checklist for ages 1.5-5 questionnaires was returned from parents of 1233 infants with mean age of 2.7 (standard deviation 0.6) years.

Children&rsquo;s dietary intake was assessed by a registered dietitian using <strong>24-hour recalls over 3 days</strong> . College students kept a detailed food record over three days. Dietary information for both groups was entered into the Nutrition Data Systems for Research database, and output was analyzed using SAS 9.4. Nutrient analyses included the Healthy Eating Index-2010, the Micronutrient Index (as a measure of overall micronutrient intake), and individual amino acids necessary for neurotransmission. Logistic regression was used to model the association of nutrient intake with ADHD. Models were adjusted for age, sex, IQ (or GPA), and energy intake (or total protein intake) as appropriate. Significance was evaluated at P = 0.05 and using the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P-value for multiple comparisons.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>No evidence existed for reduced nutrient intake among those with ADHD compared to controls in either age group. Across both groups, <strong>inadequate intakes of vitamin D and potassium were reported in 95% of participants. Children largely met nutrient intake guidelines, while college students failed to meet these guidelines for nine nutrients. In regards to amino acid intake in children, an increased likelihood of having</strong> ADHD was associated with higher consumption of aspartate, OR = 12.61 (P = 0.01) and glycine OR = 11.60 **(P = 0.05); and a reduced likelihood of ADHD with higher intakes of glutamate, OR = 0.34 (P = 0.03). Among young adults, none of the amino acids were significantly associated with ADHD, though glycine and tryptophan approached significance.</p><p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>Results fail to support the hypothesis that ADHD is driven solely by dietary micronutrient inadequacy. However, amino acids associated with neurotransmission, specifically those affecting glutamatergic neurotransmission, differed by ADHD status in children. Amino acids did not reliably vary among college students. Future larger-scale studies are needed to further examine whether or not dietary intake of amino acids may be a modulating factor in ADHD.** See also web <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28252/>Glutamate and Aspartate Are the Major Excitatory Transmitters in the Brain</a> **Chapter in a 1999 book - online, free</p><hr><h4 id=adhd-children-had-21-ng-of-vitamin-d-control--35-ng--jan2014-vitamin-d-status-in-children-with-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-pediatr-int-2014-jan-13-doi-101111ped12286>ADHD children had 21 ng of vitamin D (control = 35 ng) – Jan 2014** Vitamin D Status in Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder **Pediatr Int. 2014 Jan 13. doi 10.1111/ped.12286.</h4><p>Goksugur SB, Tufan AE, Semiz M, Gunes C, Bekdas M, Tosun M, Demircioglu F.</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Medical Faculty, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey.</p><p>BACKGROUND: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood and is an early onset, affecting 2-18 % of children worldwide.

MacDonald, Shanna H. Swan, Qi Zhao, Alison G. Paquette & Sheela Sathyanarayana</p><p>Despite evidence linking prenatal acetaminophen (APAP) exposure and adverse neurodevelopment in humans and animals, over half of pregnant women in most populations use APAP. Prior studies could be biased by inaccurate self-reported APAP use, and the molecular mechanisms linking prenatal APAP with adverse neurodevelopment are unknown. Here we estimated associations between maternal plasma biomarkers of APAP exposure, child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and placental gene expression in 307 African American mother–child pairs.</p><p>Overall, detection of APAP in second trimester plasma was associated with higher odds for child ADHD diagnosis (** odds ratio of 3.15 **(95% confidence interval 1.20 to 8.29)). Prenatal APAP exposure and ADHD were associated with placental upregulation of immune system pathways in females and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in both sexes. In females only, prenatal APAP was associated with 5.22% higher odds (0.0456–13.1%) of ADHD statistically, mediated through increased immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) expression. These results highlight placental molecular mechanisms that may underlie developmental toxicity of prenatal APAP exposure.</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>-** Note: *** <a href=/posts/acetaminophen-tylenol-increases-asthma style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) increases asthma">Acetaminophen (Tylenol) increases asthma</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><a href=/posts/autism-risk-increased-if-infant-had-antibiotics-2x-acetaminophen-3x-or-no-vitamin-d-drops-15x style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Autism risk increased if infant had antibiotics (2X), acetaminophen (3X), or no vitamin D drops (1.5X) – June 2018">Autism risk increased if infant had antibiotics (2X), acetaminophen (3X), or no vitamin D drops (1.5X) – June 2018</a></li></ul><hr><h4 id=adhd-associated-with-asthma-sleep-disturbances-epilepsy-excess-weight-wounds-injuries-rls-note-all-of-which-are-associated-with-low-vitamin-d--md-edge-jan-2024httpswwwmdedgecomneurologyarticle267431neurodevelopmental-disordersadhd-symptoms-linked-physical-comorbiditiesecdwnl_eve_240121_mdedge---->ADHD associated with asthma, sleep disturbances, epilepsy, excess weight, wounds, injuries, RLS** Note: All of which are associated with low vitamin D **** <a href="https://www.mdedge.com/neurology/article/267431/neurodevelopmental-disorders/adhd-symptoms-linked-physical-comorbidities?ecd=WNL_EVE_240121_mdedge">MD Edge Jan 2024</a> **&mdash;</h4><h4 id=adhd-in-adults>ADHD in Adults</h4><h5 id=1-in-17--us-adults-have-been-diagnosed-with-adhd>1 In 17 US adults have been diagnosed with ADHD</h5><p><a href=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/pdfs/mm7340a1-H.pdf>CDC - Oct 2024</a></p><h5 id=adhd-underappreciated-in-older-adults---sept-2023-mdedgehttpswwwmdedgecomfamilymedicinearticle265594mental-healthadhd-underappreciated-older-adultsecdwnl_eve_230926_mdedge--less-than-half-of-older-adults-with-attention-deficithyperactivity-disorder-are-diagnosed-with-the-condition-and-many-never-receive-treatment>ADHD underappreciated in older adults - Sept 2023** <a href="https://www.mdedge.com/familymedicine/article/265594/mental-health/adhd-underappreciated-older-adults?ecd=WNL_EVE_230926_mdedge">MDEdge</a> *** &ldquo;Less than half of older adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are diagnosed with the condition, and many never receive treatment.&rdquo;</h5><ul><li><p>&ldquo;To assess the possibility of ADHD, a clinician could give a patient a <a href=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/adhd/6Q_ASRS_English.pdf>six-item screening test</a> that asks questions such as how often over the previous 6 months have they had trouble completing assignments or remembering appointments.
