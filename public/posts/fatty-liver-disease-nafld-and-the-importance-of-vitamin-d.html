These non-skeletal effects are relevant in the pathogenesis and treatment of many causes of chronic liver disease. Vitamin D deficiency is frequently present in chronic liver disease and may predict non-response to antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C. Small studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation improves sustained viral response rates, while 1α-hydroxylase polymorphisms and vitamin D-binding protein are also implicated in therapeutic outcomes. Vitamin D deficiency also closely relates to the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, a key factor in the development of NAFLD. In preclinical studies, phototherapy and vitamin D supplementation ameliorate NAFLD histopathology, while vitamin D is a powerful anti-fibrotic against thioacetamide liver injury. In liver transplant recipients severe vitamin D deficiency predicts, and vitamin D supplementation prevents, acute cellular rejection. The role of vitamin D in the activation and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems may explain its importance in the above liver diseases. Further prospective studies are therefore warranted to investigate the therapeutic impact of vitamin D supplementation in chronic liver disease.</p></p></div><hr><h2 class=svArticle id=s0005><p>Introduction</h2></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0005><p>Vitamin D is an important secosteroid hormone with pleiotropic effects (<span id=bt0005><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812003601#t0005 id=ancbt0005>Table 1</a></span>).

The majority of circulating vitamin D is synthesized in the skin as a result of exposure to sunlight. The initial step involves ultraviolet-B radiation (wavelength 290–315 nm) converting the cholesterol metabolite 7-dehydrocholesterol into previtamin D<sub>3</sub> in the lower epidermis, which is rapidly converted to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in a heat-dependent process. However, excessive sunlight exposure does not cause vitamin D intoxication because excess vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is destroyed by sunlight <span id=bb0005><a class=wiki href=1 rel>1</a></span>. Only a small proportion of vitamin D is obtained from dietary sources such as fatty fish, eggs, UV-irradiated mushrooms, supplements, and artificially fortified foods (<span id=bt0010><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812003601#t0010 id=ancbt0010>Table 2</a></span>). Dietary-derived vitamins D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) and D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) are absorbed via a bile-acid dependent process whereby vitamin D is incorporated into micelles in the intestinal lumen, then absorbed by enterocytes and packaged into chylomicrons that are then transported to the venous circulation via lymphatic drainage. Vitamin D from both skin synthesis and dietary sources can either be stored in adipocytes or undergo 25-hydroxylation in the liver. This process is mediated by the 25-hydroxylases, which are cytochrome P450 isoforms that include the important microsomal CYP2R1 and the mitochondrial CYP27A1 enzymes. This produces the main circulating, though biologically inactive, form 25-hydroxyvitamin D <a class=wiki href=25(OH)D rel>25(OH)D</a>, or calcidiol, which has a long half-life of 2–3 weeks and is therefore used to assess vitamin D status. The vast majority (88%) of serum 25(OH)D is bound to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), which is also known as Gc or the group-specific component of globulin. DBP is a 58 kDa α-macroglobulin almost exclusively synthesized by the liver and a member of the albumin gene family located on chromosome 4, with high sequence homology to albumin and α-fetoprotein <span id=bb0010><a class=wiki href=2 rel>2</a></span>. It is highly polymorphic, having three common isoforms, Gc1F, Gc1S, and Gc2, that display marked racial variation <span id=bb0015><a class=wiki href=3 rel>3</a></span>, with the Gc1F isoform having the highest affinity for vitamin D metabolites. DBP has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions independent of its role as the carrier of vitamin D <a class=wiki href=4 rel>4</a> and <a class=wiki href=5 rel>5</a>.</p></p><div class="figTblUpiOuter svArticle" id=table_t0010><div class=textboxdefault><dl class=table id=t0010><dd class=lblCap><p class=caption><p><span class=label>Table 2. </span><strong class=boldFont>Sources of vitamin D</strong>.</p></p></dd><dd class=table><table><col><tbody><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><p><span><img alt border=0 class=imgLazyJSB height=321 src=http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168827812003601-fx2.jpg style=vertical-align:bottom title width=367></span></td></p></tr></tbody></table></dd><dd class=menuButtonLinks><div class=btnHolder><p><a class=menuTitle href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812003601#>Table options</a></div></p></dd></dl></div></div><p class="svArticle section" id=p0015><p>The final step in the synthesis of vitamin D is 1α-hydroxylation that predominantly occurs in the proximal tubule of the kidney but also to a lesser extent in lymphocytes and parathyroid tissue.

It is the site where 25-hydroxylation occurs and where the vast majority of DBP is synthesized. In those with chronic liver disease (CLD) the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (&lt;75 nmol/L) is almost universal, with vitamin D deficiency (&lt;50 nmol/L) present in around two-thirds of subjects. Even in the absence of cirrhosis, vitamin D deficiency is present in the majority of subjects. In those with cirrhosis, the prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency (&lt;25 nmol/L) increases with increasing severity of synthetic liver dysfunction <a class=wiki href=17 rel>17</a> and <a class=wiki href=18 rel>18</a>. Notably, in those about to undergo liver transplantation, the frequency of 25(OH)D and 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D deficiency is 84% and 77%, respectively, with transplantation resulting in a marked increase in 25(OH)D, 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, and DBP levels <span id=bb0095><a class=wiki href=19 rel>19</a></span>.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0035><p>The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this population occurs regardless of the etiology of liver disease <a class=wiki href=20 rel>20</a> and <a class=wiki href=21 rel>21</a>. Synthetic liver dysfunction is not entirely responsible, as vitamin D deficiency is still highly prevalent in those with non-cirrhotic liver disease <span id=bb0085><a class=wiki href=17 rel>17</a></span>. 25(OH)D levels normalize after oral or parenteral administration of vitamin D in patients with cirrhosis, indicating that 25-hydroxylation is preserved in this patient population <a class=wiki href=22 rel>22</a> and <a class=wiki href=23 rel>23</a>. Serum DBP levels, which play a critical role in the transport and bioavailability of vitamin D, are moderately decreased in cirrhosis <a class=wiki href=24 rel>24</a> and <a class=wiki href=25 rel>25</a>. However, as only 5% of DBP binding sites are occupied at any one time with vitamin D metabolites <span><a class=wiki href=2 rel>2</a></span>, profound liver dysfunction is required for low DBP levels to exert a significant contributing role to vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver disease.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0040><p>Vitamin D deficiency in CLD is likely to result from a number of mechanisms. In addition to those described above, those patients with a chronic medical illness such as liver disease are more likely to have lower levels of sunlight exposure and/or inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D. Moreover, luminal absorption of dietary sources of vitamin D may be hindered by intestinal edema complicating portal hypertension and/or impaired bile salt dependent micellar incorporation due to cholestasis.</p></p><h2 class=svArticle id=s0025><p>Vitamin D and chronic hepatitis C</h2></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0045><p>Around 170 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection <span id=bb0130><a class=wiki href=26 rel>26</a></span>, causing a substantial burden of chronic liver disease globally <span id=bb0135><a class=wiki href=27 rel>27</a></span>.

Current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in CHC is incomplete.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0050><p>Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that vitamin D may impact upon clinical outcomes and treatment response. Fundamental to this are several <em>in vitro</em> studies showing that vitamin D inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in a dose-dependent manner <a class=wiki href=30 rel>30</a>, <a class=wiki href=31 rel>31</a> and <a class=wiki href=32 rel>32</a>. Moreover, an association between baseline vitamin D status and treatment response to pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) has recently been established (<span id=bf0010><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812003601#f0010 id=ancbf0010>Fig. 2</a></span>).

However, 25(OH)D level is not associated with SVR in HCV–HIV co-infection <span id=bb0170><a class=wiki href=34 rel>34</a></span>.

Moreover, recipients of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation were less likely to be relapsers or non-responders to antiviral therapy, and had improved insulin resistance indices <span><a class=wiki href=36 rel>36</a></span>. Similarly, a small retrospective Italian study showed vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation improved SVR rate in the treatment of recurrent hepatitis C post liver transplantation (53.3% <em>vs.</em> 18.5%, <em>p</em> = 0.02) <span id=bb0190><a class=wiki href=38 rel>38</a></span>. It remains unclear whether these improvements in the clearance of HCV with vitamin D supplementation are the result of an alteration in innate and/or adaptive immune function, or are mediated via improvement in insulin resistance. Large, prospective, placebo-controlled studies are thus required to assess the impact of vitamin D supplementation on viral response in CHC treatment. However, these studies now seem unlikely to occur in the new and rapidly evolving era of direct acting viral therapy.</p></p></div><div class=page_fragment id=frag_3><p class="svArticle section" id=p0060><p>Vitamin D status also reportedly correlates with liver histology in CHC.

At a cellular level, vitamin D deficiency is associated with downregulation of the 25-hydroxylase enzyme CYP27A1 in liver tissue.

Moreover, a recently published proteomic study has shown vitamin DBP to be one of three metaproteins associated with SVR <span id=bb0200><a class=wiki href=40 rel>40</a></span>. DBP levels are significantly lower in subjects with significant or advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F2-4) compared with those with absent or minimal fibrosis (F0/1) and healthy controls <a class=wiki href=41 rel>41</a> and <a class=wiki href=42 rel>42</a>.</p></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0070><p>Thus, vitamin D deficiency appears to be common in CHC and may be associated with adverse outcomes such as lower treatment response, more advanced fibrosis stage and increased severity of necroinflammation. It remains, however, uncertain as to whether vitamin D supplementation improves the SVR rate in patients receiving combination anti-viral therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV. Still, the findings of a significant association between the <em>CYP27B1</em> rs10877012 A/C polymorphism, higher 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels, and SVR rate, as well as the association between vitamin D-binding protein and SVR suggest that higher 25(OH)D and 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels directly improve the virologic response to PEG-IFN and RBV therapy, presumably by impacting on the downstream regulation of vitamin D target gene transcription. DBP determines how much free 25(OH)D substrate is available for 1α-hydroxylase as well as the amount of free 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D ligand available to activate the VDR and influences downstream gene transcription. Hepatic 1α-hydroxylase activity levels therefore represent a major additional factor regulating 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentration in the liver.</p></p><h2 class=svArticle id=s0030><p>Vitamin D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</h2></p><p class="svArticle section" id=p0075><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome.

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are a family of transmembrane PRRs with broad specificity, expressed on immune cells such as polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, and macrophages. They interact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as viral nucleic acids, and bacterial and fungal products, to trigger an inflammatory (TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6) or antimicrobial response in the host <span id=bb0455><a class=wiki href=91 rel>91</a></span>. Several data from studies focusing on the immunology of mycobacterial infection suggest vitamin D and DBP play a significant part in the activation of the innate immune response. The risk of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (TB) infection is increased in subjects with vitamin D deficiency, with the greatest risk observed in subjects with the lowest 25(OH)D levels <a class=wiki href=78 rel>78</a>, <a class=wiki href=92 rel>92</a>, <a class=wiki href=93 rel>93</a> and <a class=wiki href=94 rel>94</a>. At a cellular level, macrophages infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> initiate a TLR2/1 response that enhances 1α-hydroxylase and VDR expression and induction of the anti-microbial peptide cathelicidin. The anti-microbial activity of macrophages occurs via a vitamin D-dependent process. Addition of 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>-infected macrophages reduces the number of viable bacilli, while both vitamin D and TLR2/1 are required for cathelicidin production <span id=bb0475><a class=wiki href=95 rel>95</a></span>. DBP plays a key role in modulating monocyte responses to 25(OH)D and 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, that varies according to the DBP genotype. Notably, monocytes cultured in serum from <em>DBP</em> null mice, and in human serum with the lower affinity Gc1S and Gc2 DBP isoforms, have more potent induction of cathelicidin than monocytes cultured in serum from <em>DBP</em>+/− mice or human serum with the high affinity Gc1F isoform <span id=bb0480><a class=wiki href=96 rel>96</a></span>. The Gc2 isoform is associated with lower 25(OH)D levels <a class=wiki href=97 rel>97</a> and <a class=wiki href=98 rel>98</a>, and carriers of this allele have an increased susceptibility to active TB in the presence of severe vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 nmol/L) <span id=bb0495><a class=wiki href=99 rel>99</a></span>. The Gc2 isoform is less able to be converted into macrophage activating factor, resulting in reduced macrophage function <span id=bb0020><a class=wiki href=4 rel>4</a></span>. These data indicate that vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial responses may be strongly influenced by genetic polymorphisms in DBP, especially in the presence of vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, adjunctive high-dose vitamin D significantly hastens the time to sputum culture conversion during intensive-phase antimicrobial treatment of pulmonary TB in the subset of patients with the tt genotype of the <em>TaqI</em> VDR polymorphism <span id=bb0500><a class=wiki href=100 rel>100</a></span>.

Dietary factors, such as a high-fat diet that predisposes to NAFLD, may also contribute to increased intestinal permeability and result in increased hepatic exposure to LPS <span id=bb0520><a class=wiki href=104 rel>104</a></span>. Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of the liver, represent 80–90% of the macrophages in the body <span id=bb0525><a class=wiki href=105 rel>105</a></span>, and their innate immune vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response is also likely to be influenced by the vitamin D status and genetic polymorphisms in DBP. They also express TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, and are responsive to LPS, the main ligand of TLR4. Hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, sinusoidal epithelial cells, biliary epithelial cells, and hepatic DCs also express TLR4 and are responsive to LPS. The interaction of LPS with TLR4 in the liver is crucial during hepatic fibrogenesis <a class=wiki href=101 rel>101</a> and <a class=wiki href=106 rel>106</a>. Serum vitamin D levels are inversely proportional to TLR2 and TLR4 expression in monocytes, with administration of 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D downregulating expression of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 <a class=wiki href=107 rel>107</a>, <a class=wiki href=108 rel>108</a>, <a class=wiki href=109 rel>109</a> and <a class=wiki href=110 rel>110</a>.

The anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties of vitamin D provide plausible mechanisms by which vitamin D may impact on disease progression and severity, especially in CHC and NASH. However, there are few prospective studies evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation in chronic liver disease and these are clearly warranted in the areas of NASH and CHC based on preclinical, and limited retrospective and prospective clinical data. Genetic polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor and of proteins and enzymes involved in vitamin D synthesis and activation have an association with vitamin D status and severity of liver disease. Further studies are also warranted in this area, to confirm known associations and evaluate other genetic polymorphisms, especially in the vitamin D binding protein, which plays a key role in vitamin D synthesis, activity and bioavailability (<span id=bt0025><a class=intra_ref href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812003601#t0025 id=ancbt0025>Table 5</a></span>). In the interim period, we recommend vitamin D status to be assessed in all patients with CLD and, if deficiency is present (&lt;50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml), supplementation with 1000–4000 IU/day of vitamin D3 should be initiated, with the initial dose dependent upon baseline 25(OH)D levels. However, increasing evidence suggests that supplementation should be considered for a 25(OH)D level &lt;75 nmol/L, especially in those considering interferon-based antiviral therapy for CHC. Further prospective studies are required to identify an optimal 25(OH)D level in subjects with CLD.</p></p><div class="figTblUpiOuter svArticle" id=figure_f0015><div class=textboxdefault><dl class="figure svArticle" id=f0015><dt class=autoScroll><p><a class=figureLink href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827812003601#fx6 title="Full-size image (39 K)"><img alt="Full-size image (39 K)" border=0 class="imgLazyJSB figure large" height=249 src=http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168827812003601-fx6.jpg style=height:249px;width:369px width=369></a></dt></p></dl></div></div><dl class=table id=t0025><dd class=lblCap><p class=caption><p><span class=label>Table 5. </span><strong class=boldFont>Key future research requirements</strong>.</p></p></dd><dd class=table><table><col><tbody><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=1><p><span><img alt border=0 class=imgLazyJSB height=141 src=http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0168827812003601-fx5.jpg style=vertical-align:bottom title width=778></span></td></p></tr></tbody></table></dd><dd class=menuButtonLinks></dd></dl></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/alcohol.html><span class=tag>alcohol</span></a>
