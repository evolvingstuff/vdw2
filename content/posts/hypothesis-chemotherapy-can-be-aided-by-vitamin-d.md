#### DNA Repair in Despair-Vitamin D Is not Fair

Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, DOI: 10.1002/jcb.25552

Elżbieta Gocek, George P. Studzinski studzins@njms.rutgers.edu

The role of vitamin D as a treatment option for neoplastic diseases, once considered to have a bright future, remains controversial. The preclinical studies discussed herein show compelling evidence that Vitamin D Derivatives (VDDs) can convert some cancer and leukemia cells to a benign phenotype, by differentiation/maturation, cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis. Further, there is considerable, though still evolving, knowledge of the molecular mechisms underlying these changes. However, the attempts to clearly document that the treatment outcomes of human neoplastic diseases can be positively influenced by VDDs have been, so far, disappointing. The clinical trials to date of VDDs, alone or combined with other agents, have not shown consistent results. It is our contention, shared by others, that there were limitations in the design or execution of these trials which have not yet been fully addressed. Based on the connection between upregulation of JNK by VDDs and DNA repair,  **we propose a new avenue of attack on cancer cells by increasing the toxicity of the current, only partially effective, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs by combining them with VDDs** . This can impair DNA repair and thus kill the malignant cells, warranting a comprehensive study of this novel concept.

##### Notes by VitaminDWiki after renting PDF

26 page PDF 

Includes great tabular summaries of completed as well as on-going clinical trials of vitamin D for various forms of cancer

Most clinical studies appeared to use Calcitriol, but some used standard Cholecalciferol
