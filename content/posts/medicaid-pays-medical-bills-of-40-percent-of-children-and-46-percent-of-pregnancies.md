#### [Medicaid - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid)

"Medicaid in the United States is a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, like nursing home care and personal care services. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as a "government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care".<sup>[1]</sup> Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to 74 million low-income and disabled people (as of 2017)."

#### How is Medicaid different from Medicare?

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | MEDICAID	 | MEDICARE |
| STRUCTURE	 | A joint federal and state program. Each state establishes its own standards for Medicaid eligibility, benefits and provider payment rates under broad federal guidelines that establish certain minimum standards.	 | A federal health insurance program. The federal government sets all standards. |
| FINANCING | Costs shared by both the federal and state governments.	;  | Paid for entirely by the federal government. |
| ELIGIBILITY | Serves low-income and disabled children, parents, pregnant women and the elderly, as well as other disabled adults. Since 2014, states may expand Medicaid to low-income adults who had not been previously eligible.	 | Serves elderly and disabled people who receive Social Security, regardless of income. |
| BENEFITS | Provides the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit, which ensures children covered by Medicaid receive all medically necessary care, including physician and hospital visits, well-child visits and treatment, immunizations, dental, vision, and hearing services.	 | Does not have a benefit package for children since Medicare was designed with adults, not children, in mind. |

#### [Enrolling Americans in Medicaid Is Now Cheaper Than Subsidizing Their Obamacare Coverage](https://slate.com/business/2018/08/medicaid-expansion-is-now-more-cost-effective-than-obamacare-exchanges.html) Slate Aug 2018

"This year, Capitol Hill’s official scorekeeper predicts that Washington will spend an average of $6,300 on each individual who purchases subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. Meanwhile, it’s set to spend just over $4,900 for each Medicaid recipient who enrolled thanks to the law’s expansion of the program.1"
