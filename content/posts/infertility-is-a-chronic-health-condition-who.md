#### Might the global falling fertility rates be considered a chronic health problem? [Perplexity AI Deep Research Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/fertility-rate-of-singapore-an-YhPUTiHFShaYEr2FPx7_4A)

 **The Global Fertility Decline: A Multifaceted Health and Societal Challenge** 

The global decline in fertility rates represents one of the most profound demographic shifts in human history. From an average of 4.8 children per woman in 1950, the global fertility rate has plummeted to 2.2 in 2024 and is projected to fall further to 1.8 by 2100 [1](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/06/declining-fertility-rates-put-prosperity-of-future-generations-at-risk.html) [13](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/undesa_pd_2025_wfr-2024_advance-unedited.pdf). This trend, characterized by its persistence and wide-reaching implications, raises critical questions about whether it constitutes a chronic health problem. While fertility decline is driven by both voluntary societal choices and biological factors, its intersection with reproductive health, environmental stressors, and long-term public health challenges positions it as a complex issue with significant chronic health dimensions.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Biological Foundations of Fertility Decline</span>** 

 **Age-Related Fertility Reduction** 

Human reproductive capacity is intrinsically tied to age, particularly for women. Female fertility begins to decline markedly after age 35 due to diminishing ovarian reserve and egg quality, with a sharp drop post-37 [4](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20354317) [15](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy). By age 40, the likelihood of conception per menstrual cycle falls to 1 in 10, compared to 1 in 4 for women in their 20s [15](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy). Male fertility also declines with age, albeit more gradually, as sperm quality and motility deteriorate [9](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/infertility-faq/index.html). These biological constraints are compounded by lifestyle factors such as obesity, smoking, and environmental toxin exposure, which further impair reproductive health [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/) [9](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/infertility-faq/index.html) [16](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality).

 **Rising Prevalence of Reproductive Disorders** 

Medical conditions contributing to infertility—including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and diminished ovarian reserve—are increasingly prevalent. PCOS alone affects 8–13% of women globally and is the leading cause of anovulatory infertility [9](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/infertility-faq/index.html). Male factor infertility, driven by poor sperm quality or structural issues like varicocele, accounts for 40–50% of infertility cases [4](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20354317) [9](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/infertility-faq/index.html). The  **World Health Organization**  classifies infertility as a disease of the reproductive system, underscoring its status as a chronic health condition affecting 1 in 6 couples globally [9](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/infertility-faq/index.html) [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10905510/).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Environmental and Lifestyle Contributors</span>** 

 **Endocrine Disruptors and Toxins** 

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)—found in plastics, pesticides, and personal care products—has been linked to reduced sperm counts, ovarian dysfunction, and hormonal imbalances [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/). Air pollution, particularly fine particulate matter (PM2.5), is associated with lower live birth rates in IVF cycles and increased miscarriage risk [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/). Nanoplastics, now ubiquitous in food and water supplies, have been shown to penetrate placental barriers, potentially interfering with fetal development [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/).

 **Delayed Parenthood and Societal Pressures** 

The average age of first-time mothers in OECD countries has risen from 28.6 in 2000 to 30.9 in 2022 [1](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/06/declining-fertility-rates-put-prosperity-of-future-generations-at-risk.html). This delay, driven by educational and career pursuits, exacerbates age-related fertility decline. Economic pressures, including housing costs and stagnant wages, further deter family formation, creating a feedback loop where financial insecurity perpetuates low fertility [10](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/confronting-low-fertility-rates-and-population-decline) [16](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Demographic and Health System Implications</span>** 

 **Aging Populations and Dependency Ratios** 

By 2060, the OECD projects that the ratio of individuals aged 65+ to working-age adults will double from 30:100 to 59:100 [1](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/06/declining-fertility-rates-put-prosperity-of-future-generations-at-risk.html). This inversion strains healthcare systems, as older populations require more medical care for chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and dementia. Japan, where 33% of the population is over 65, spends 11% of GDP on healthcare—a burden that low-fertility countries will increasingly face [16](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality).

 **Economic Stagnation and Workforce Shortfalls** 

The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that by 2100, 97% of countries will have fertility rates below replacement level [6](https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/newsroom/news-releases/lancet-dramatic-declines-global-fertility-rates-set-transform). Without immigration, this could reduce global GDP growth by 0.4–0.8% annually, as shrinking workforces struggle to support retirees [16](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality). Countries like South Korea, where fertility fell to 0.7 in 2023, already face labor shortages in critical sectors such as healthcare and manufacturing [1](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/06/declining-fertility-rates-put-prosperity-of-future-generations-at-risk.html) [6](https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/newsroom/news-releases/lancet-dramatic-declines-global-fertility-rates-set-transform).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Chronic Health Dimensions of Fertility Decline</span>** 

 **Infertility as a Chronic Disease** 

Infertility meets the criteria for a chronic condition: it is persistent, requires ongoing medical management, and significantly impacts quality of life. The psychological toll—including depression, anxiety, and marital stress—is comparable to that of cancer or HIV [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10905510/). Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), while effective, are inaccessible to many due to cost, with IVF cycles averaging $12,000–$15,000 in the U.S. [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10905510/). In low-income countries, limited healthcare infrastructure leaves millions untreated, perpetuating cycles of poverty and social marginalization [5](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/global-fertility-rate-continues-fall-how-governments-could-prepare) [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10905510/).

 **Epigenetic and Intergenerational Effects** 

Emerging research suggests that environmental toxins may induce epigenetic changes, altering gene expression related to reproductive health across generations [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/). For example, prenatal exposure to phthalates has been linked to reduced ovarian follicle counts in female offspring, potentially perpetuating fertility decline [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/). These findings position low fertility not merely as a demographic trend but as a multigenerational health crisis.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Policy and Public Health Responses</span>** 

 **Targeted Reproductive Healthcare** 

Expanding access to fertility preservation (e.g., egg freezing) and subsidizing ART could mitigate age-related infertility. Denmark’s model—where public funding covers 70% of IVF costs—has maintained higher birth rates than similarly developed nations [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10905510/). Simultaneously, addressing underlying conditions like obesity (a factor in 12% of infertility cases) through preventive care could improve fecundity [9](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/infertility-faq/index.html) [15](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy).

 **Environmental and Occupational Reforms** 

Regulating EDCs and reducing workplace exposure to reproductive toxins (e.g., pesticides for agricultural workers) are critical. The EU’s REACH regulations, which restrict hazardous chemicals, offer a template for safeguarding reproductive health [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/). Urban planning initiatives to curb air pollution, such as low-emission zones, could further protect fertility [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11079147/).

 **Economic Support for Families** 

Pronatalist policies like Sweden’s gender-equal parental leave (480 days per child) and Singapore’s Baby Bonus cash grants (up to $10,000 per child) aim to alleviate financial barriers to childbearing [10](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/confronting-low-fertility-rates-and-population-decline) [13](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/undesa_pd_2025_wfr-2024_advance-unedited.pdf). However, such measures must be paired with affordable housing and childcare to address root causes of delayed parenthood [16](https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/dependency-and-depopulation-confronting-the-consequences-of-a-new-demographic-reality).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Conclusion</span>** 

The global fertility decline transcends mere demographic change, embodying a chronic health challenge with biological, environmental, and societal roots. While voluntary choices play a role, the rising prevalence of infertility-related medical conditions, coupled with toxic environmental exposures, underscores its status as a public health crisis. Addressing this issue demands integrated strategies spanning healthcare reform, environmental regulation, and economic support—failure to act risks entrenching a cycle of demographic decline and deteriorating population health. As the OECD warns, without intervention, the consequences will be "devastating for future generations" [1](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2024/06/declining-fertility-rates-put-prosperity-of-future-generations-at-risk.html)

Most of a women's reasons for being child-free were rooted in fear. 

Once upon a time, Bombardieri says, most of her clients ultimately decided to have kids. 

But these days, the breakdown is closer to 50-50.

Bombardieri tries to help people interrogate their preconceived notions about parenthood and visualize what they’d gain or give up on either path. 

Perhaps most importantly, she helps people grapple with the idea of regret, which haunts many fence sitters.

The goal is to figure out which road will lead to fewer regrets, and to grieve those feelings rather than suppress them.

She found role models who’d successfully balanced interesting careers in academia with motherhood and got more comfortable around children while working in day-care centers

Fertility is difficult to test: 

For many couples, having a baby is far more difficult than it was made out to be in sex ed. While many women in heterosexual couples get pregnant within a few months of trying, studies suggest up to 15% of couples are unable to conceive after a year of having unprotected sex. That means they meet the clinical definition of infertility: not conceiving within a year if the woman is younger than 35, or within six months if she’s 35 or older.

Ovarian-reserve testing is fairly easy, but it’s not always an accurate predictor of future pregnancies, Schon says. In a major 2017 study, the results of which were replicated in 2022, researchers found that AMH levels were not significantly correlated with later pregnancy and birth. Ovarian reserve tests are “poor independent predictors of reproductive potential. Therefore, they should not be used as a fertility test,” the American Society for Reproductive Medicine said in a 2020 policy statement.

great reduction in 3 of the 4 with Vitamin D  NYT Aug 2024

When the survey was conducted in 2023, 47 percent of those younger than 50 without children 

said they were unlikely ever to have children, an increase of 10 percentage points since 2018.

Further reasons included the desire to focus on other things, like 

* their career or interests; 

* concerns about the state of the world; 

* worries about the costs involved in raising a child; 

* concerns about the environment, including climate change; and 

* not having found the right partner.

For some, having children is simply not an option: 13 percent of those surveyed by Pew who were under age 50 said they didn’t plan to have children because of infertility, and 11 percent said that it was their partner or spouse who did not want kids.

Many were “averse to embracing the kinds of risks that having children implies,”

Further reasons included the desire to focus on other things, like their career or interests; concerns about the state of the world; worries about the costs involved in raising a child; concerns about the environment, including climate change; and not having found the right partner.

Can IVF solve the fertility crisis?  MIT Review  July 2024

around one in six people is affected by infertility, 

“Europe today has 10% of the population, 20% of gross domestic product, and 50% of the welfare expense of the world,”

By one recent estimate, the global fertility rate is declining at a rate of 1.1% per year. 

TFR in South Korea was just 0.8—well below the 2.1 needed to maintain the population. I

. IVF is already involved in 5% to 10% of births in high-income countries.

in 2020, the use of ART increased the (US) fertility rate by about 1.3%. 

In Australia, however, ART boosted the fertility rate by 5%.

Why the difference? It all comes down to accessibility. IVF can be prohibitively expensive in the US—without insurance covering the cost, a single IVF cycle can cost around half a person’s annual disposable income. Compare that to Australia, where would-be parents get plenty of government support, and an IVF cycle costs just 6% of the average annual disposable income.

Several countries have used “pronatalist” policies to encourage people to have children. Some involve financial incentives: Families in Japan are eligible for one-off payments and monthly allowances for each child, as part of a scheme that was recently extended.

IVF - always frozen egg?  NO !

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-14/fertility-firms-conceivable-gameto-oviva-work-to-make-ivf-better?

Any woman who has endured in vitro fertilization or egg freezing can tell you that the process is brutal — you’re cranky, bloated and a whole host of other things that are TMI to discuss here. Despite this, it’s not an uncommon experience: In 2021, the most recent year for which Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data is available, procedures rose over 26% compared with the previous year, to more than 413,000.

Marcia Inhorn, a Yale anthropologist and author of the book Motherhood on Ice, found that more women are choosing to freeze their eggs as a way to cope with this reality. She concluded that there’s a mating gap. Society has changed in a way that just makes it harder to start a family earlier. In her study of women who froze eggs, 82% of them were single “with no partner in sight.” The rest were in unstable relationships with men or waiting for their partner to be ready for parenthood. The stories of women in her book were just like me. It wasn’t until I was past my fertile prime that I met someone to start a family with.
