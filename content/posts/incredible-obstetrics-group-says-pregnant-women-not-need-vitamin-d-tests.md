# [No vitamin D screening in pregnancy: committee](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/20/us-vitamin-d-pregnancy-idUSTRE75J6YH20110620%20) from Reuters

## (Reuters Health) - Most pregnant women do not need to be screened for vitamin D deficiency, nor given additional supplements, according to an official statement issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

The only pregnant women who might benefit from a blood test for vitamin D deficiency - and it's not clear even for them --  **are those who are at high risk for the problem in the first place due to certain diseases or other circumstances** .

And if a woman asked if she could take a supplement with modest amounts of vitamin D, "I would be okay with that," Macones added. "I just wouldn't routinely recommend it."

To date, researchers have not published a randomized controlled study of the effects of vitamin D on pregnancy. That type of trial yields the most reliable results.

Given the lack of conclusive evidence, the ACOG committee did not recommend that pregnant women be screened routinely for vitamin D deficiency and take supplements. Its report appeared online June 20th in ACOG's monthly medical journal, Obstetrics & Gynecology.

For now, as  **Wagner said in an email, "According to the IOM and the Endocrine Society, up to 4000 IU per day is safe during pregnancy; any dose above that should be taken in consultation with the patient's physician."**

# The following summary is for posting as comment elsewhere

Incredible. There are 150+ studies showing how important vitamin D is before during and after pregnancy.

They seem to have totally missed out on the need for vitamin D if:

- have dark skin

- living in the North

- short time from previous pregnancy

- twins

- recent stress
