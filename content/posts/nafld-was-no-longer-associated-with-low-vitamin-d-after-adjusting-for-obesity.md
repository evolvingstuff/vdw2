 **Data can only be "adjusted" for variables that are not associated .  
 Obesity is well known to be inversely associated with vitamin D  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The founder of VitaminDWiki is amazed that this study got thu peer review**

"After statistical adjustment for waist circumference in this study, the univariate association between vitamin D deficiency and CAP (ie, steatosis) was no longer statistically significant"**

Objectives: The relationship between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains uncertain due to conflicting results and few studies with histologic endpoints. We therefore used multiple imaging and histologic NAFLD endpoints to more comprehensively assess the association between VDD and NAFLD in a large pediatric population.

Methods: Data were obtained from an ongoing pediatric NAFLD study in Bronx, NY. Briefly, overweight and obese children aged 2-18 years with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels ≥ 35 U/L were serially enrolled. Liver biopsy was obtained in accordance with clinical guidelines. All participants had liver imaging, namely, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP; Echosens, France) to assess steatosis and, to assess fibrosis, vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE; FibroScan™, Echosens, France) and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI; Philips, Netherlands) imaging. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured serologically.

Results: N=276 (88%) of 315 participants had 25-OH vitamin D results, of whom 241 (87%) were Hispanic, 199 (72%) were male, and 92 (33%) underwent liver biopsy. VDD was univariately associated with high waist circumference (p=0.004), high-density lipoprotein level (p=0.01), season (p=0.009), and CAP score (p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, only waist circumference (p=0.0002) and biopsy inflammation grade (p=0.03) were associated with VDD, though the latter had not approximated statistical significance in univariate analysis (p=0.56). There was no association between VDD and hepatic steatosis, ballooning, NAFLD Activity Score, ARFI or VCTE elasticity scores.

Conclusions: VDD was not associated with NAFLD defined by imaging and histologic endpoints, except for a possible relation with histologic inflammation grade.
