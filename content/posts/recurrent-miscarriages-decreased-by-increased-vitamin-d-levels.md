#### Study on the clinical value of Vitamin D in recurrent spontaneous abortion: Revisiting the Importance of Vitamin D

Am J Reprod Immunol. 2024 Jan;91(1):e13810. [doi: 10.1111/aji.13810.](https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13810.)

##### Many more successful pregnancies when Vitamin D had been added

__ Study does not appear to describe how much Vitamin D was given, for how long **Objective: This study explores the possible pathogenesis of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) caused by vitamin D (VD), provides evidence-based bases for prevention and treatment of RSA, improves female reproductive health.

Methods: This study randomly selected 305 patients without spontaneous abortion (SA0), 216 patients with a spontaneous abortion (SA1) and 200 patients with RSA from 1421 women of childbearing age who visited the RSA specialty clinic of Hangzhou First People's Hospital from January 2021 to June 2023 to conduct a prospective clinical study. Then, we collected the data of clinical diagnosis and treatment, conducted intervention and follow-up, and finally executed statistical analysis.

Results: (1) RSA patients were significantly older than the other two groups. (2) The rates of VD deficiency in SA1 and RSA patients were significantly higher than those in SA0. (3) When BMI < 20 or > 24 kg/m2 , there were abnormal increase in VD and increased number of spontaneous abortions. (4) The bilateral S/D of the VD-sufficient, VD-insufficient and VD-deficient groups gradually increased with statistical significance (p ≤ .018). (5) Among the 65 cases undergoing embryo chromosome examinations, chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 55.38% and 69.05% in RSA patients. (6) Among 186 patients with abnormal ACA, there was a certain negative correlation between ACA and VD, which was stronger among RSA patients. Moreover, ACA significantly decreased (p < .001) after effectively supplementing VD, and the miscarriage rate of re-pregnancy also decreased.

Conclusion: The rate of VD deficiency is higher in RSA patients. VD deficiency may be related to the age of women of childbearing age and too low or high BMI, and may cause abnormal plasma antiphospholipid antibodies, increased uterine artery resistance and abnormal chromosomal division during fertilization, leading to spontaneous abortion and even RSA. The improvement of VD deficiency may reduce the risk of RSA occurrence.

Objective: This study explores the possible pathogenesis of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) caused by vitamin D (VD), provides evidence-based bases for prevention and treatment of RSA, improves female reproductive health.

Methods: This study randomly selected 305 patients without spontaneous abortion (SA0), 216 patients with a spontaneous abortion (SA1) and 200 patients with RSA from 1421 women of childbearing age who visited the RSA specialty clinic of Hangzhou First People&#39;s Hospital from January 2021 to June 2023 to conduct a prospective clinical study. Then, we collected the data of clinical diagnosis and treatment, conducted intervention and follow-up, and finally executed statistical analysis.

Results: (1) RSA patients were significantly older than the other two groups. (2) The rates of VD deficiency in SA1 and RSA patients were significantly higher than those in SA0. (3) When BMI &lt; 20 or &gt; 24 kg/m2 , there were abnormal increase in VD and increased number of spontaneous abortions. (4) The bilateral S/D of the VD-sufficient, VD-insufficient and VD-deficient groups gradually increased with statistical significance (p ≤ .018). (5) Among the 65 cases undergoing embryo chromosome examinations, chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 55.38% and 69.05% in RSA patients. (6) Among 186 patients with abnormal ACA, there was a certain negative correlation between ACA and VD, which was stronger among RSA patients. Moreover, ACA significantly decreased (p &lt; .001) after effectively supplementing VD, and the miscarriage rate of re-pregnancy also decreased.

Conclusion: The rate of VD deficiency is higher in RSA patients. VD deficiency may be related to the age of women of childbearing age and too low or high BMI, and may cause abnormal plasma antiphospholipid antibodies, increased uterine artery resistance and abnormal chromosomal division during fertilization, leading to spontaneous abortion and even RSA. The improvement of VD deficiency may reduce the risk of RSA occurrence.
