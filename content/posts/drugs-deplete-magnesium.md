#### [Magnesium Makes Drugs Look Good!](http://archive.aweber.com/drcarolyndean/GMiBM/h/Magnesium_Makes_Drugs_Look.htm) Dean Nov 2012

* . . . when you take a drug, magnesium, like the true heroine she is, will rush in to help offset the drug. In doing so, you can experience some magnesium benefits. IN FACT, the so-called "beneficial" effects of many drugs may be due to this flood of magnesium. Of course, that can only happen for so long before a person's magnesium stores are totally depleted. THEN, after 6-8 weeks the drug side effects really take hold.

* The following commonly used drugs can create magnesium deficiencies.(15)

> Common diuretics (for high blood pressure)

> Bronchodilators, such as theophylline (for asthma)

> Birth control pills

> Insulin

> Digitalis (for some heart conditions)

> Tetracycline

> Corticosteroids (for asthma)

> Cocaine

> Nicotine

> Drugs containing fluoride: Prozac, Cipro (anti-biotic), etc.
