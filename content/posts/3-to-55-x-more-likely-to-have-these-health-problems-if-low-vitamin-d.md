 **Notes:** 

1. These are typically the ratios between groups having > 30 ng/ml and those having < 10 ng/ml

1. Have not listed the many diseases with 2X - 3X decrease - list got to be too long

1. More than [half of all senior men take baby aspirin](/posts/baby-aspirin-reduces-heart-problems-vitamin-d-much-better) to get a 10% reduction of getting a second heart attack

> [__1.1 X__ more likely to get heart attack if NOT take BABY Aspirin](/posts/baby-aspirin-reduces-heart-problems-vitamin-d-much-better)

> Wish  that there was $100 million to market Vitamin D the way Bayer marketed baby aspirin
