BACKGROUND:

Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) are frequently deficient in vitamin D. Low vitamin D levels are associated with a worse prognosis.

OBJECTIVES:

The VINDICATE (VitamIN D treatIng patients with Chronic heArT failurE) study was undertaken to establish safety and efficacy of high-dose 25 (OH) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD.

METHODS:

We enrolled 229 patients (179 men) with chronic HF due to LVSD and vitamin D deficiency (cholecalciferol <50 nmol/l [<20 ng/ml](<20%20ng/ml)). Participants were allocated to 1 year of vitamin D3 supplementation (4,000 IU <span>[100 μg]</span> daily) or matching non-calcium-based placebo. The primary endpoint was change in 6-minute walk distance between baseline and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included change in LV ejection fraction at 1 year, and safety measures of renal function and serum calcium concentration assessed every 3 months.

RESULTS:

One year of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve 6-min walk distance at 1 year, but was associated with a significant improvement in cardiac function (LV ejection fraction +6.07% <span>[95% confidence interval (CI): 3.20 to 8.95; p < 0.0001]</span>); and a reversal of LV remodeling (LV end diastolic diameter -2.49 mm <span>[95% CI: -4.09 to -0.90; p = 0.002]</span> and LV end systolic diameter -2.09 mm <span>[95% CI: -4.11 to -0.06 p = 0.043]</span>).

CONCLUSIONS:

One year of 100 μg daily vitamin D3 supplementation does not improve 6-min walk distance but has beneficial effects on LV structure and function in patients on contemporary optimal medical therapy. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these translate to improvements in outcomes. (VitamIN D Treating patIents With Chronic heArT failurE <span>[VINDICATE]</span>; NCT01619891).
