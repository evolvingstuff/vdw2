Pharmacist was too busy with paperwork 

Hospital added pharmacy technicians

One of the pharmacy technicians jobs was to deal with vitamin D deficiency (<30 ng)

Percentage of patients not tested & treated dropped from 44% down to 8%

* Great progress, now if they could learn that more vitamin D is needed for those with dark skins, elderly, obese, etc.  

* Also, it would be nice if they could learn about use of loading doses to restore vitamin D levels in days rather than months.

It is well established that  **ward pharmacy technicians**  (WPTs) can assist pharmacists with some clinical pharmacy services, thereby improving patient access to these services.<sup>[1, 2]</sup> However, there has been little exploration of whether WPT support improves appropriateness of patient care.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in older people and has been associated with increased risk of falls and fractures.<sup>[3]</sup> It is recommended that at-risk older people be screened for vitamin D deficiency, and that deficiencies are treated with oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).<sup>[3]</sup> It is routine for older people admitted to our aged care unit to have their vitamin D levels checked and supplementation commenced if necessary. However, sometimes screening and/or treating vitamin D deficiency is overlooked. The ward pharmacist assists by reviewing patients’ measured vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, requesting levels if they have not been done and advising on cholecalciferol therapy as part of routine clinical review.

We conducted a retrospective audit to explore whether an expanded WPT role, which included assisting the pharmacist with accessing laboratory data on admission, impacted on the frequency of vitamin D screening and the proportion of vitamin D-deficient patients discharged on an appropriate dose of cholecalciferol.

Prior to the study, in 2010, there was one full-time ward pharmacist providing care for 56 subacute aged care patients, with 0.4 full-time equivalent WPT support – largely confined to assisting with medication supply. A prospective observational study at the time showed that the  **pharmacist spent 42% of her time undertaking non-clinical tasks and was unable to consistently deliver services such as clinical review** .<sup>[2]</sup> In 2011, the WPT position was increased to 1.0 full-time equivalent, and the WPT was trained to assist with selected clinical pharmacy activities in addition to supporting medication supply.<sup>[2]</sup> 

 **One of the WPT roles was documenting vitamin D levels (and date taken)**  on a subacute Medication Management Plan, along with a range of other data relevant to drug therapy (e.g. serum creatinine levels), for review by the pharmacist within the first 2–3 working days of transfer to the subacute ward.<sup>[2]</sup>

The audit included 50 consecutive patients prior to and 50 consecutive patients after the introduction of the expanded WPT role. The  **target 25(OH)D level in our aged care unit was ≥75 nmol/L**  and this level was used to define vitamin D adequacy in this study.<sup>[4]</sup> Appropriate cholecalciferol dosing was defined as 1 microgram for every 1 nmol/L deficiency<sup>[4]</sup> (rounded up to the nearest 25 micrograms due to dose-forms available). The pharmacist and WPT were unaware of the audit.

The proportion of patients screened and, if deficient, appropriately treated with cholecalciferol increased from 33/50 ( **66%** ) to 46/50 ( **92%** ) (p = 0.003) following the introduction of the expanded WPT role. The improvement was a result of an increase in both the proportion of patients who were screened (from 88 to 98%) and the proportion of deficient patients who received an adequate dose of cholecalciferol on discharge (from 69 to 89%).

These results indicate that increased WPT support, including assistance with screening key laboratory data for pharmacist review, can improve patient care.
