#### BPH about 50% more likely if poor VDR – meta-analysis March 2024

 **Association between vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and genetic susceptibility to benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Medicine (Baltimore) 2024 Mar 1;103(9):e37361. [doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000037361.](https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000037361.)

Background: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the global public health challenges due to the complexity of its mechanisms of occurrence. Many studies have suggested that vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms are associated with BPH susceptibility. Still, their conflicting findings need to be analyzed in aggregate to gain a better understanding.

Methods: We identified 10 trials involving 1539 BPH cases and 1915 controls through a systematic search of Embase using, data obtained from the Web of Science, PubMed, and China Knowledge Network databases as of December 31, 2021. A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between 4 constant polymorphisms of this associated vitamin D receptor gene (Fok-1, Bsm-1, Taq-1, and Apa-1) and BPH risk.

Results: In the overall population analysis, a significant positive association with BPH risk was found only in the Taq-1 variant (P < .001). Of these, the pure-hybrid model (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 1.384-3.196), the heterozygous model (95% CI = 1.207-2.021), the dominant model (95% CI = 1.312-2.133) and the allelic inheritance model (95% CI = 1.205-1.730) showed low heterogeneity. In subtype analyses, Bsm-1 variants showed a significant association with BPH risk for both the recessive (95% CI = 0.100-0.943, P = .039) and over-dominant (95% CI = 1.553-3.100, P = 0) models in the Caucasian population, and for the recessive (95% CI = 1.242-3.283, P = .039) and over-dominant (95% CI = 0.281-0.680, P = 0) models in the Asian population. In addition, a high degree of heterogeneity was found in the subgroup analysis of the association between Fok-1 variants and BPH risk.

Conclusion: Overall, there is an association between vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and BPH risk. Identification of BPH susceptibility by vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms has potential.
