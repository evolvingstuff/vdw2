 **Highlights** 

• A high prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy is observed in old European women.

• There is a highly significant difference in vitamin D level across European countries.

• Age, BMI, country and vitamin D supplementation are associated with vitamin D level.

Inadequate vitamin D status is associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased bone turnover and bone loss, which in turn increases fracture risk. The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of inadequate vitamin D status in European women aged over 80 years.

Assessments of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25(OH)D) were performed on 8532 European women with osteoporosis or osteopenia of which 1984 were aged over 80 years. European countries included in the study were:  **France, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland, Hungary, United Kingdom, Spain and Germany** . Two cut-offs of 25(OH)D inadequacy were fixed: <75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml) and <50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml).

Mean (SD) age of the patients was 83.4 (2.9) years, body mass index was 25.0 (4.0) kg/m2 and level of 25(OH)D was 53.3 (26.7) nmol/L (21.4 <span>[10.7]</span> ng/ml). There was a highly significant difference of 25(OH)D level across European countries (p < 0.0001). In these women aged over 80 years, the prevalence of 25(OH)D inadequacy was 80.9% and 44.5% when considering cut-offs of 75 and 50 nmol/L, respectively. In the 397 (20.0%) patients taking supplemental vitamin D with or without supplemental calcium, the mean serum 25(OH)D level was significantly higher than in the other patients (65.2 (29.2) nmol/L vs. 50.3 (25.2) nmol/L; P < 0.001).

This study indicates a high prevalence of vitamin D (25(OH)D) inadequacy in old European women. The prevalence could be even higher in some particular countries.
