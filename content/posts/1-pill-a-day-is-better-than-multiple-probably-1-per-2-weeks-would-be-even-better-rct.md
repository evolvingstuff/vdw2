Results

A total of 2499 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a median of 36 months. A primary-outcome event occurred in 118 of 1237 patients ( **9.5%** ) in the polypill group and in 156 of 1229 ( **12.7%** ) in the usual-care group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). 

A key secondary-outcome event occurred in 101 patients (8.2%) in the polypill group and in 144 (11.7%) in the usual-care group ( **hazard ratio, 0.70;**  95% CI, 0.54 to 0.90; P=0.005). The results were consistent across prespecified subgroups. Medication adherence as reported by the patients was higher in the polypill group than in the usual-care group. Adverse events were similar between groups.
