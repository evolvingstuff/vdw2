&nbsp; &nbsp;* Defined either as serum levels less than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), 

&nbsp; &nbsp;or as lowest percentiles vs. highest; risk expressed as percent increased for those with normal or highest levels.

### Fairly good overview of vitamin D

>30 ng = sufficiency (standard)

1 billion people have < 30ng (does not mention far more people do not have optimal (50ng) nor high optimal (80 ng))

64% of Americans do not have enough to operate at ‘’peak capacity’’ ( 30 ng)

>50 ng = minimum optimal (<a href="/posts/lots-of-discussion-on-50-ng-being-too-low-jut-right-or-too-high" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2028">lots of discussion on 50 ng being too low, jut right, or too high)</a>

80 ng = high optimal (Unaware that any national standard board recommends this level yet, but I agree)

Shows association of 40+ diseases with low levels of vitamin D

### Uses old estimate of how many IU to increase blood level

Uses old rule of thumb: need <a href="/posts/100-iu-for-each-additional-1ng-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 809">100 IU for each additional 1ng of vitamin D</a>

The old estimate is wrong in that the equation is not linear, varies with nanogram level, and varies with body weight

Their example 20 ng ==> 50 ng would equate to  **3,000 IU**  needed

<a href="/posts/grassrootshealth-chart" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 766">GrassRootsHealth chart</a> indicates 29 IU per lb. For 20 ==> 50 ng

To get to 50 ng a 200 lb person would need to take  **5,800 IU**
