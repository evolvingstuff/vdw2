Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D levels and hemostatic factors like tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).

Methods: Patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) levels measured were included. 

Coagulation and hemostatic parameters were evaluated. 

Patients were divided into 3 groups based on 25(OH)D3 levels as 

* group 1 (25(OH)D3 < 10 ng/mL, n = 25), 

* group 2 (25(OH)D3 = 10-19.9 ng/mL, n = 22), and 

* group 3 (25(OH)D3 ≥ 20 ng/mL, n = 28).

Results: A total of 75 patients with a mean age of 39 (range 18-57) years were included in the study. 

 **Prothrombin time was longer in group 3 than in group 2 (P = .043)** . 

The TFPI levels were higher in group 3 than in the other groups (P < .001). 

 **There was a strong positive correlation between 25(OH)D3 and TFPI levels (r = .47, P < .001).** 

Conclusion: Further studies are needed for evaluation of the role of TFPI in hemostasis and thrombotic process in patients with vitamin D deficiency.

Thrombosis (Greek: θρόμβωσις) is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus; Greek: θρόμβος) inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss. Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.
