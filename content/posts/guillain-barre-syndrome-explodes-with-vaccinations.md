"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was previously considered a rare disease that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system. This damage causes muscle weakness, tingling, numbness, and sometimes paralysis and loss of control over the bowel and bladder."

"Jeung et al analyzed the WHO Vigibase vaccine safety system with >8 million reports and focused on 15,377 cases of GBS as summarized by TrialSite News. The average case had GBS  **develop 5.5 days after a vaccine shot."

&quot;Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was previously considered a rare disease that occurs when the body&#39;s immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system. This damage causes muscle weakness, tingling, numbness, and sometimes paralysis and loss of control over the bowel and bladder.&quot;
&quot;Jeung et al analyzed the WHO Vigibase vaccine safety system with &gt;8 million reports and focused on 15,377 cases of GBS as summarized by TrialSite News. The average case had GBS __develop 5.5 days after a vaccine shot.&quot;
