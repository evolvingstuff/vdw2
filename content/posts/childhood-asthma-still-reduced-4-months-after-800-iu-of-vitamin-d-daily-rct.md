* 800 IU daily raised levels from 28 ng to 32 ng @ 2 months

* Vitamin D supplementation for only 2 months

* at 6 months (4 months after supplementation stopped)

> only 15 % of children who had Vitamin D had poor air flow rate

> vs 35% who had no added vitamin D

 **Comment** 

1. 800 IU is not very much

1. Would have probably been better if a loading dose had first been used

BACKGROUND:

In our prior randomized trial on preventing influenza, asthma attacks as a secondary outcome occurred less often in the vitamin D group than the placebo group. We aimed to clarify whether low-dose, short-term vitamin D supplementation, in addition to standard treatments, improves control of childhood asthma.

METHODS:

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D3 supplements (800 IU/day) with placebo for 2 months in schoolchildren with asthma. The primary outcomes were frequency and severity of asthma judging from changes of asthma control levels defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) by collaborating doctors at 2 and 6 months.

RESULTS:

Japanese schoolchildren with asthma (n=89) were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D (n=54) or placebo (n=35). At 2 months, GINA asthma control was significantly more improved in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group (P=0.015). Childhood asthma control test (CACT) scores, a secondary outcome, were also significantly (P=0.004) improved in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group at 2 months, and differences remained significant (P=0.012) at 6 months. The proportion of patients with a peak expiratory flow rate <80% predicted was significantly less in the vitamin D group (8/54: 15%) than the placebo group (12/35: 34%) at 6 months (P=0.032).

CONCLUSIONS:

Low-dose, short-term vitamin D supplementation in addition to standard treatment may improve levels of asthma control in schoolchildren.
