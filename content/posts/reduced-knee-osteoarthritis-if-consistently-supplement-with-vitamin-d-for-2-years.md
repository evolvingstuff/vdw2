 **Note by founder of VitaminDWiki** 

* I have consistently keep my Vitamin D levels high (> 90 ng), for 5+ years - that was not enough!

* Eliminated  my diagnosed knee osteoarthitis in 1/2 year by topical Magnesium in DMSO to my knees every few days, and also supplement with Boron

* Update Oct 2018 (3 years later) occasional twinge of pain several times a year- which goes away the same day with topical Mg in DMSO

   * Currently taking Mg and Boron daily - added to my granola
