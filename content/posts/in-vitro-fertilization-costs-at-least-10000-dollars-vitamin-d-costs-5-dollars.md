#### [Considering IVF? Here’s How Much It Costs In Canada](https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/how-much-does-ivf-cost-in-canada) Sept 2019

 **“Infertility affects one in six heterosexual couples in Canada”** 

 **One round of IVF costs $10,000 to $20,000** 

 **“IVF gets expensive because the most any province will cover is one round... and on average, it takes 2.7 rounds of IVF in order to get pregnant.**

* " Insurance rarely covers IVF, and the costs run anywhere from $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle (a cycle takes about a month and includes stimulating a woman’s ovaries to produce eggs, extracting the eggs, inseminating them outside the body, and implanting an embryo)."

* "They used 8,789 time-lapse videos of developing embryos to train an algorithm that predicts the likelihood of successful embryo implantation."

* "...the company reports that using its algorithm resulted in a 12 percent increase in positive predictive value (identifying embryos that would lead to implantation and healthy pregnancy) and a 29 percent increase in negative predictive value (identifying embyros that would not result in successful pregnancy) when compared to an external panel of embryologists."

#### It appears that some IVF could be eliminated by increasing the Vitamin D levels

   * Vitamin D increases fertility of BOTH the man and the woman.

   * Each 1 ng increase in blood level of vitamin D increases fertility by 1%.

   * You may not have heard much about it since Vitamin D was patented for fertility way back in 1990.

   * Vitamin D has been used by zoos and vets for a long time to increase birth rate

> "The latest SART report shows that 61,740 babies were born in the U.S. as a result of IVF in 2012. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports about 4 million births per year in the U.S., meaning  **1 to 2 percent of all U.S. births**  annually are via IVF."

#### Women often eat pinapple on IVF day ([New York Times - Oct 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/style/pineapple-in-vitro-fertilization-pregnancy.html))

 **No evidence that pinapple improves success, vs 4X improvement in IVF if have lots of VIitamin D**
