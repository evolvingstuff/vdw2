### [Did you know that Sunlight is not a source of Vitamin D ?](http://www.bubblews.com/news/3008528-did-you-know-that-sunlight-is-not-a-source-of-vitamin-d) Bubblews

When I entered the College of Nursing we were taught that sunlight was never a source of vitamin D. 

Hope I never get any graduates of that Nursing school as my nurse.
