 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D deficiency can not only affect bones but have association with cardiovascular effects.

* The likelihood of unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes, especially major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), new MI, and all-cause mortality among deficient vitamin D patient is poorly understood.

* This is a first and most comprehensive meta-analysis with the largest sample size thus far comparing vitamin D levels in terms of cardiovascular outcomes.

* High risk patients need to monitor vitamins level and implement vitamins supplementation to avoid adverse outcomes especially elder females.

Background

The relation between blood vitamin D levels and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes is debatable. To our knowledge this is the first comparative meta-analysis of more than 100,000 patients’ data with the aim to inspect the relevance of low vitamin D levels with adverse cardiovascular events.

Methods

Online databases including PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central were queried to compare the cardiovascular outcomes among hypovitaminosis D (HVD) and control group. The outcomes assessed included differences in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), mortality, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a random-effect model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and P less than 0.05 as a statistical significance.

Results

A total of 8 studies  **including 426,039 patients**  were included in this analysis. HVD group was associated with a 

higher incidence of MACE ( **OR 1.92** , 95% CI 1.24 to 2.98, p = 0.003), 

while there was no significant association of 

* HVD and all-cause mortality (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.17, p = 0.19),

* risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24, p = 0.22), and 

* heart failure (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.25, p = 0.78).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggested that low blood levels of vitamin D are associated with MACE, 

 **but no such difference in** 

* all-cause mortality, 

* myocardial infarction or 

* heart failure 

was observed. 

Appropriate supplementation of vitamin D in selected populations might be cardioprotective in nature and warrants extensive trials.

Vitamin D deficiency is a prevalent condition, occurring in about 30-50% of the population, observed across all ethnicities and among all age groups. Besides the established role of vitamin D in calcium homeostasis, its deficiency is emerging as a new risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In particular, several epidemiological and clinical studies have reported a close association between low vitamin D levels and major CVDs, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. Moreover, in all these clinical settings, vitamin deficiency seems to predispose to increased morbidity, mortality, and recurrent cardiovascular events. Despite this growing evidence, interventional trials with supplementation of vitamin D in patients at risk of or with established CVD are still controversial. In this review, we aimed to summarize the currently available evidence supporting the link between vitamin D deficiency and major CVDs in terms of its prevalence, clinical relevance, prognostic impact, and potential therapeutic implications.
