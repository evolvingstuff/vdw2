#### Highlights

Vitamin D modulates cytokines and muscle performance.

Supplemental vitamin D increased 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D without altering work.

Supplemental vitamin D increased IFN-γ and IL-10 in vitamin D insufficient adults.

Wow –[a journal just about Cytokines](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cytokine) – 71st edition no less!!

4,000 and 8,000 IU doses were both tried

Did not matter dose size, just that blood levels were raised above 30 ng

The purpose of this study was to determine if vitamin D status before supplementation influences the cytokine response after supplemental vitamin D. Forty-six reportedly healthy adults (mean(SD); age, 32(7) y; body mass index (BMI), 25.3(4.5) kg/m2; serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 34.8(12.2) ng/mL) were randomly assigned (double blind) to one of three groups: (1) placebo (n = 15), or supplemental vitamin D (cholecalciferol) at (2) 4000 (n = 14) or (3) 8000 IU (n = 17).  **Supplements were taken daily for 35 days** . Fasting blood samples were obtained before (Baseline, Bsl) and 35-days after (35-d) supplementation. Serum 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), cytokines, and intact parathyroid hormone with calcium were measured in each blood sample. 

Supplemental vitamin D increased serum 25(OH)D (4000 IU, ≈29%; 8000 IU, ≈57%) and 1,25(OH)D (4000 IU, ≈12%; 8000 IU, ≈38%) without altering intact parathyroid hormone or calcium. 

The vitamin D metabolite increases in the supplemental vitamin D groups (n = 31) were dependent on initial levels as serum 25(OH)D (r = −0.63, p < 0.05) and 1,25(OH)D (r = −0.45, p < 0.05) at Bsl correlated with their increases after supplementation. 

Supplemental vitamin D increased interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 in subjects that were vitamin D insufficient (serum 25(OH)D < 29 ng/mL) compared to sufficient (serum 25(OH)D ⩾ 30 ng/mL) at Bsl. 

We conclude that supplemental vitamin D increase a pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine in those with initially low serum 25(OH)D.
