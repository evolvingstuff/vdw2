* By 2014, 120,000 people in Pacific Island Countries were infected, which was believed to be a conservative estimate due to underreporting”

>  **Note – Zika is probably very underreported in the Americas** 

* “Drier conditions may have enhanced <span>[Zika]</span> vector dispersal”

* These mosquitoes have “adapted to be active during the daytime and thrive in urban areas.”

>  **Note: many still suggest nighttime and outdoor Zika activity** 

* “range of a mosquito is 1–3 miles” e.g. 15,000 feet

>  **Note: many sources still say range is <300 feet, and ignore more distant breeding locations** 

>  **Note: many countries ignore indoor breeding locations** 

* . . “known to be active and aggressive during the daytime hours, but especially during dusk or dawn in cloudy weather, and often indoors.”

* . . “eggs can survive for long periods of time in a dry state”

>  **Note: some sources state that Zika mosquito eggs must first dry out and then become wet** 

>  **Note: many countries fail to consider indoor breeding locations: crawlspaces, attics, shelves, toilet tanks,** 

* Zika testing: no consistent best test liquid, saliva blood and urine are used

>  **Note: Zika can test positive in one liquid but not the other two.** 

* “Adhesion factors including AXL, Tyro3, and DC-SIGN were found to facilitate Zika virus entry into human skin cells.”

> VitaminDWiki had not been aware that the skin is a potential Zilka barrier

> Google query for <span>[ ~hs~ (AXL OR Tyro3 OR DC-SIGN) skin "vitamin D" ~hs~ ]</span> found 97,000 items July 2016

> Hmmm - might putting Vitamin D oil/spray on ankles prevent Zika infection?
