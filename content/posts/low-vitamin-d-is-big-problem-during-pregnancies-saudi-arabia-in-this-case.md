Background and aims: Maternal vitamin-D deficiency is a significant health concern among pregnant women in the Middle East. Vitamin-D deficiency during pregnancy has been associated with adverse maternal outcomes and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. This study aimed to identify the level of vitamin-D during pregnancy and examine the effect of different vitamin-D levels during pregnancy on maternal outcomes.

Methods: A descriptive correctional design was utilized in this research. This study was conducted at the obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinics at Shaqra general hospital, Saudi Arabia. A purposive sample of 221 pregnant women. Four tools were used: (1) a structured interviewing questionnaire; (2) laboratory records; (3) a vitamin-D risk factors assessment questionnaire; and (4) a follow-up sheet for maternal outcomes.

Results: 

* Nearly half of the study sample (46.2%) had insufficient vitamin-D in the blood, 

* 40.3% had sufficient level of vitamin-D, and 

* (13.6%) had a vitamin-D deficiency. 

The non-modifiable risk factors for vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy were maternal age, dark skin pigmentation, hyperglycemia, anemia, mal-absorption syndrome, and genetic mutation. While the modifiable risk factors were inadequate sun exposure, middle-income status, low vitamin-D diet, obesity, and low consumption of milk products during pregnancy. There was a relationship between adverse pregnancy outcomes and a vitamin-D deficiency during pregnancy (p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Maternal vitamin-D deficiency is significantly associated with a high risk for emergency c-section and complications during pregnancy and labor. Preconception intervention programs should focus on raising vitamin-D levels among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia to prevent vitamin-D deficient-linked adverse pregnancy outcomes.
