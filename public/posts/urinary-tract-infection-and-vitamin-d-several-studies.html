Every sixth month, a questionnaire on respiratory tract infections (RTI) (common cold, bronchitis, influenza) and urinary tract infection (UTI) was filled in.</p><p>Results: Mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level was 60 nmol/L. Two hundred and fifty-six subjects received vitamin D and 255 placebo. One hundred and sixteen subjects in the vitamin D and 111 in the placebo group completed the five-year study. Eighteen subjects in the vitamin D group and 34 subjects in the placebo group reported UTI during the study (p &lt; 0.02), whereas no significant differences were seen for RTI. The effect on UTI was most pronounced in males. The effect of vitamin D on UTI was unrelated to baseline serum 25(OH)D level.</p><p>Conclusion: Supplementation with vitamin D might prevent UTI, but confirmatory studies are needed.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uti-20k-rct-sci-hub-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>Response to 20,000 IU weekly for years was 49 ng/mL</strong></p><hr><h5 id=cited-61-times-as-of-aug-2024httpsscholargooglecomscholarcites1605310383796965653as_sdt548sciodt048hlen>Cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1605310383796965653&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en">61 times as of Aug 2024</a></h5><hr><h4 id=more-children-with-utis-have-low-vitamin-d-45-x-or-zinc-34-x---april-2024>More children with UTIs have low Vitamin D (4.5 X) or Zinc (3.4 X) - April 2024</h4><p><strong>Serum Vitamin D and Zinc Levels in Children with Urinary Tract Infection without Confounding Factors: A Case-Control Study</strong></p><p>Med J Islam Repub Iran . 2024 Apr 2:38:36. <a href=https://doi.org/10.47176/mjiri.38.36.>doi: 10.47176/mjiri.38.36.</a> eCollection 2024.</p><p>Mohsen Seifollahi 1, Marzieh Heidarzadeh Arani 2, Rozita Hoseini Shamsabadi 3, Shahrbanoo Nakhaie 4, Maesoumeh Karimi Aghche 5, Mohammad Javad Azadchehr 6, Amin Sadat Sharif 7</p><p><strong>What is “already known” in this topic</strong></p><p>Zinc and vitamin D in sufficient concentrations help maintain the immune system&rsquo;s health.

This study examined associations between serum zinc and vitamin D as immune biomarkers and UTI while controlling for other known risk factors.

They have numerous potential causes. Without proper diagnosis and treatment, UTIs can lead to serious complications in children, including impaired growth, high blood pressure, protein in urine, and eventual chronic kidney disease. Zinc and vitamin D in sufficient concentrations help to maintain the health of the immune system. Therefore, their deficiency can cause various infections. Several factors can contribute to the development of UTIs. This article deals with the role of zinc and vitamin D as immune markers in UTI in children without other risk factors.</p><p>Methods: In this case-control study, serum zinc and vitamin D levels without any other risk factors were examined in 40 healthy children and 40 children with UTIs. Data analysis was done through SPSS 26 using the chi-square, the Fisher&rsquo;s exact, and independent t tests.</p><p>Results: The study findings demonstrated a statistically significant distinction between the 2 groups regarding serum vitamin D and zinc levels (P &lt; 0.001); 80% of children with UTIs and 17.5% in the healthy group had vitamin D deficiency. Also, 60% of the urinary infection group had zinc deficiency, whereas 17.5% of the healthy group had it.</p><p>Conclusion: Low serum zinc and vitamin D levels may increase susceptibility to pediatric UTI. Given the data, supplementation with zinc and vitamin D could play a significant role in treating active infections and preventing recurrence in susceptible children.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uti-d-zinc-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=half-of-young-women-get-a-uri-annually---perplexity-ai-aug-2024httpswwwperplexityaisearchhow-often-do-women-get-utis-ulpk3mxdsdcddjcxn0bwzg>Half of young women get a URI annually - <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-often-do-women-get-utis-ulpK3MxdSDCDDJCXn0bWZg>Perplexity AI Aug 2024</a></h4><p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common health issue among women. Approximately 50-60% of women will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. The frequency of UTIs can vary based on age and other factors.</p><p><strong>Frequency of UTIs in Women</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Lifetime Incidence</strong> : Around 50-60% of women will have a UTI at some point in their lives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Annual Incidence</strong> : In young women, the estimated incidence of UTIs is about <strong>0.5 episodes per person per year.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Recurrent UTIs</strong> : About 25% of women experience recurrent UTIs, which are defined as having at least two infections in six months or three in a year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Age-Related Trends</strong> : The prevalence of UTIs increases with age. For example, in postmenopausal women, the rate is approximately double that of the overall female population.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Risk Factors</strong></p><p>Several factors increase the likelihood of developing UTIs in women:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Anatomy</strong> : Women are more prone to UTIs due to a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria easier access to the bladder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sexual Activity</strong> : Increased sexual activity is a significant risk factor for UTIs, particularly in younger women.</p></li><li><p><strong>Postmenopausal Changes</strong> : Hormonal changes after menopause can increase UTI risk due to changes in the vaginal microbiome and bladder function.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Health Conditions</strong> : Conditions like diabetes, use of catheters, and structural abnormalities in the urinary tract can also increase the risk.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Impact and Management</strong></p><p>UTIs are responsible for a substantial number of medical visits annually and can significantly affect the quality of life due to symptoms like pain, frequent urination, and potential complications if left untreated. Management often involves antibiotics, but non-antimicrobial strategies, such as increased hydration and cranberry supplements, are also recommended to reduce recurrence.</p><hr><h4 id=cranberry-juice-cuts-use-of-antibiotics-for-uti-in-half---aug-2024>Cranberry Juice cuts use of antibiotics for UTI in half - Aug 2024</h4><p><strong><a href="https://ma1.mdedge.com/familymedicine/article/270297/preventive-care/its-juice-cranberries-uti-prevention?ecd=WNL_EVE_240808_mdedge&amp;uac=138704MX">MDEdge</a> 8 studies</strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382343"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382343",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382343"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382343"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382343"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382343"></script></body></html>
