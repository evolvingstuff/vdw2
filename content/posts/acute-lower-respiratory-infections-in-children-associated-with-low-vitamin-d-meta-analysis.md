#### Vitamin D Deficiency and Acute Lower Respiratory Infections in Children Younger Than 5 Years: Identification and Treatment

Journal of Pediatric Health Care, Volume 28, Issue 6, November–December 2014, Pages 572–582

Allison Larkin, MS, NP-C, , Jane Lassetter, PhD, RN

Introduction

Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is a leading cause of childhood mortality. Research suggests that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) puts children at risk for ALRI. The purpose of this review is to examine ALRI and VDD in children 5 years and younger. Common etiologies, diagnosis, prevention, treatment of ALRI, and recommendations for vitamin D supplementation are summarized.

Method

Databases were searched for studies investigating VDD and ALRI in children. Independent reviewers assessed the internal validity of the studies.

Results

Of 18 studies examined,  **VDD was found to be associated with increased risk or severity of ALRI in 13 studies** ; associations were not found in 4 studies. In one study it was found that high maternal vitamin D levels was associated with ALRI in infants.

Discussion

Vitamin D supplementation is a low-cost, low-risk intervention that providers should consider for children, especially those at high risk for ALRI. Practitioners should follow current recommendations when prescribing vitamin D supplementation for infants and children.
