Note:  
1) Omega-3 was given for 14 days or death in ICU  
2) Omega-3 can be given at >2X daily rate[for many weeks](/tags/for-many-weeks.html)  
3)[Emulsified Omega-3 is 3X more bio-available than standard Omega-3](/posts/emulsified-form-of-omega-3-is-3x-more-bioavailable-in-low-fat-meal) (low-fat meal)  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it appears that standard Omega-3 was given in this RCT  
4) Omega-3 reduces all-cause mortality in non-COVID-19 settings as well  
5) [Weekly Omega-3 might be better than daily- similar to Vitamin D](/posts/omega-3-weekly-is-more-bio-available-than-daily-rat-study)
