I was very impressed with the results of the small controlled trials of Vectomega, so I decided to give it a try.

I had been taking Coromega for about a decade

I had been taking lots of vitamin D for 4 years

I started taking Vectomega in April 2014 and felt noticeably better in just 3 days

The good feeling has continued for years

 **Updates   
2018 - The Vectomega tablet was the last tablet I had been taking  
 Now I grind the tablet up into a powder to take with all of [my other powdered supplements](/tags/my-other-powdered-supplements.html) on a daily basis  
2017: I have never noticed any fishy taste or smell, but a few people have  
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Simple solution - put tablet inside of a 00 size gell capsule  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,000 of the empty gell capsules  cost about $10 on Amazon** 

 **[Their literature states](http://www.europharmausa.com/products/vectomega/%20)** 

• Omega-3s from salmon as nature intended, in the exact form    your brain uses best

• 2:1 ratio of DHA/EPA—never chemically altered or artificially spiked

• Five types of heart and brain healthy phospholipids,    including phosphotidylserine

• Unique bioactive salmon peptides not found in any other Omega-3 products—for mood, brain, and heart health*

• Extracted without chemicals, solvents or excessive heat

• Third party tested for purity—no concerns with toxins,    heavy metals, or contaminants

• Hexane-Free

• Great stability, zero rancidity

• Omega-3 Phospholipid   Peptide Complex 1 capsule = 292 mg

### Press release by the company (no longer available Nov 2018)

* Small clinical trial in France

* Forty healthy volunteers followed for 60 days, and compliance was 100%.

* Dosage  was one 300 mg tablet two times daily

* 2 capsules of Vectomega is the equivalent of 16 capsules (7200 mg) of standard fish oil  **<span style="color:#F00;">8X more</span>** 

* (EuroPharma offers Vectomega(R) in raw material or finished tablet form)

[Vectomega costs more than all of the rest of my supplements combined](/posts/low-cost-cofactors-for-vitamin-d) 56 cents per day

### Personal history of use of Omega-3 by the founder of VitaminDWiki

Had been taking [Coromega](https://www.amazon.com/Coromega-Omega3-Squeeze-Packets-120-Count/dp/B003V7YLIG/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1502099770&sr=8-1&keywords=coromega&th=1) form for a decade

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 packages/day having EPA = 350/ mg of DHA= 230 mg per package

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; supposed to be 3X more bio-available than standard Omega-3

Starting Vectomega 1 per day (early 2014) (similar price but 8X more bio-available)

Felt the benefit in about 3 days, but also got a bloody nose

Stopped taking it, nose stopped bleeding

Re-started taking Vectomega 1 per day

Bloody nose again in a few days

Dropped back to Vectomega every other day, Nose was OK

- - - years past- - 

Took a low-cost [Omega-3 test](/posts/omega-3-is-vital-for-health-mail-in-test-is-low-cost-and-accurate)which showed that I was a little low

Increased taking Vectomega to 3 days out of 4, no bleeding nose
