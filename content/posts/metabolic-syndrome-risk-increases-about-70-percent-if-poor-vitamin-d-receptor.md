#### 1.9X increased risk of Metabolic Syndrome in Thai – June 2018

 **Highlights** 

* VDR TaqI TT, and BsmI BB + Bb genotypes were associated with lower 25(OH)D in MetS.

* VDR BsmI BB + Bb genotypes increased odds ratio of hypertriglyceridemia.

* VDR Cdx2 GG genotype was associated with higher WC in all subjects.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphisms have been found associated with MetS and serum 25(OH)D levels but these associations remain controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the VDR polymorphisms and MetS, metabolic components, and serum 25(OH)D levels within the Thai population. A case–control study included 237 participants with MetS according to the MetS diagnostic criteria of NCEP ATPIII and 376 controls. Anthropometric data, blood pressure, lipid profiles, serum 25 (OH)D, and fasting blood glucose were measured. VDR FokI, BsmI, TaqI, and Cdx2 polymorphisms were genotyped by using PCR-HRM. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of VDR genotypes and alleles between MetS and the control groups. VDR TaqI TT, and BsmI BB + Bb genotypes were associated with lower 25(OH)D levels (p < 0.05) in comparison to TaqI Tt, and BsmI bb genotypes in the MetS group, respectively. In addition, the VDR Cdx2 GG genotype was associated with higher WC compared with the AG genotype in all subjects (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that BB + Bb genotypes of the VDR BsmI had significantly increased the odds ratio (OR) of hypertriglyceridemia when compared with the bb genotype ( **OR 1.87** ; 95% CI 1.10–3.19, p = 0.022). In conclusion, VDR BsmI variant was associated with hypertriglyceridemia and may be predisposed to developing MetS. VDR TaqI and BsmI polymorphisms seems to influence serum 25(OH)D levels in MetS subjects, while Cdx2 polymorphism may influence WC in all subjects.

#### 1.4X increased risk of Metabolic Syndrome – Aug 2017

 **VDR Gene variation and insulin resistance related diseases.** 

Lipids Health Dis. 2017 Aug 19;16(1):157. [doi: 10.1186/s12944-017-0477-7.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-017-0477-7.)

BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D status may influence the risk of Insulin resistance related diseases such as Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), metabolic syndrome (MetS), and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Several studies have assessed vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism in relationship with these diseases; however, results remain inconsistent. Our study was conducted to elucidate whether VDR Gene polymorphisms could predict insulin resistance on a large scale.

METHODS:

A meta-analysis using MEDLINE and EMBASE, was performed up to December 16th, 2016. Studies reporting association of vitamin D gene polymorphism with incident T2DM, MetS and PCOS outcomes were included and sub-group analysis by pigment of skin and latitude were performed.

RESULTS:

A total of 28 articles based on four gene variation, and comprising 9232 participants with 5193 Insulin resistance related diseases patients were included. No significant associations of the VDR ApaI, BsmI, FokI and TaqI variant with Insulin resistance related diseases were found. However, sub-group analysis analysis showed that PCOS in TaqI (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.03-2.09, P = 0.03) for T allele and MetS for G allele ( **OR = 1.41** , 95% CI = 1.07-1.85, P = 0.01) in BsmI was significant association with VDR gene polymorphism. Simultaneously, sub-group analysis showed VDR ApaI rs7975232(G > T)variant was associated with insulin resistance related diseases in Asians (GG/GT + TT) (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.03-2.53; P = 0.04) and population who lived in middle latitude district (30-60°) (GG/GT + TT) (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.04-1.43; P = 0.02), VDR BsmI rs1544410 (A > G)and VDR Taq1rs731236 (T/C) variant were associated with insulin resistance related diseases in Caucasian (dark-pigmented).

CONCLUSION:

The results suggested that the association between insulin resistance related diseases and VDR ApaI, BsmI, FokI variant was more obvious in dark-pigmented Caucasians and Asians but not in Caucasian with white skin.
