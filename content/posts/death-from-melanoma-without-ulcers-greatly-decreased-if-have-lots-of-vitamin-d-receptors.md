Background: Vitamin D3, acting via vitamin D receptor (VDR) affects a wide range of biological activities, including inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis, with net antitumor effects. VDR expression is disturbed in many tumors, including melanomas. 

Aim: To find correlation between VDR expression in melanomas and prognostic biomarkers. Materials and Methods: 

VDR was analyzed immunohistochemically in 69 cutaneous melanomas in relation to prognostic factors. 

Results: Less advanced melanomas showed significantly higher VDR expression than the advanced stages. 

The presence of other markers such as ulceration and lack or non-brisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was accompanied by significantly lower VDR expression. VDR expression also affected overall survival (OS) with most noticeable effect in the cases without ulceration. 

Conclusion: High VDR expression determines a less malignant phenotype and is related to better prognosis. 

Loss of VDR expression affects melanoma tumor behavior, allowing for progression of disease. 

VDR expression can also serve as a prognostic marker in routine histopathology evaluation.
