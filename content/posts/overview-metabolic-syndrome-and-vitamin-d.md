#### [WikiPedia Metabolic Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome)

Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical disorders that, when occurring together, increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes

It affects one in five people in the United States and prevalence increases with age. 

Some studies have shown the prevalence in the USA to be an estimated 25% of the population

Many different definitions of Metabolic Syndrome

#### Vitamin D measurements, Vit D Binding Protein, and Metabolic Syndrome - June 2017

 **Impact of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, free and bioavailable fractions of vitamin D, and vitamin D binding protein levels on metabolic syndrome components.** 

Arch Med Sci. 2017 Jun;13(4):745-752. [doi: 10.5114/aoms.2016.58594.](https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2016.58594.) Epub 2016 Mar 16.

INTRODUCTION:

Various forms of vitamin D and factors involved in their metabolism can play a role in the etiopathogenesis of metabolic disorders. This paper aims to define the relationship between concentration of the hydroxylated form of vitamin D (25(OH)D), the fraction of free and bioavailable vitamin D, and of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) levels on the one hand and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome components on the other.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:

The studies were conducted on 79 people, including 52 with metabolic syndrome (MetS+) and 27 without it (MetS-). Biochemical measurements (lipid profile, glycemia, 25(OH)D, VDBP, albumin, calcium, parathyroid hormone) were performed, concentration of free and bioavailable vitamin D was mathematically calculated, and anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were taken.

RESULTS:

The mean ± SD concentration of 25(OH)D among MetS+ individuals (41.90 ±13.12 nmol/l) was lower (p < 0.0001) than among the MetS- group (66.09 ±18.02 nmol/l). Differences between groups were observed in relation to medians/means of concentrations of free and bioavailable vitamin D (p < 0.0001) but not in the case of VDBP. In the entire study population, 25(OH)D correlated with all metabolic syndrome components, whereas its free and bioavailable fraction correlated with particular components of the syndrome. In the MetS+ group, VDBP concentration negatively correlated with body mass index (p = 0.037) and levels of diastolic pressure (p = 0.022). In the case of the MetS- group, the free fraction of vitamin D negatively correlated with triglyceridemia (p = 0.049).

CONCLUSIONS:

The evaluation of various forms of vitamin D and VDBP in different population groups seems to have significant clinical value in evaluating the prevalence of metabolic disorders.

#### Metabolic Syndrome 13% more likely for each 10 ng decrease in vitamin D - meta-analysis - March 2014

 **Blood vitamin D status and metabolic syndrome in the general adult population: a dose-response meta-analysis.** 

J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Mar;99(3):1053-63. [doi: 10.1210/jc.2013-3577.](https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-3577.) Epub 2013 Jan 1.

* CONTEXT: Increasing evidence has suggested an association between blood vitamin D levels and metabolic syndrome.

* OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the relationship between blood vitamin D status and metabolic syndrome in the general adult population, using a dose-response meta-analysis.

* DATA SOURCE: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases through July 2013 to identify relevant studies.

* STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies, reporting risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for metabolic syndrome in ≥3 categories of blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels, were selected.

* DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was performed independently by 2 authors, and the quality of the studies was evaluated using the risk of bias assessment tool for nonrandomized studies.

* DATA SYNTHESIS: The pooled odds ratio of metabolic syndrome per 25 nmol/L increment in the serum/plasma 25(OH)D concentration was 0.87 (95% CI = 0.83-0.92, I(2) = 85%), based on 16 "cross-sectional studies" and 1.00 (95% CI = 0.98-1.02, I(2) = 0%) for 2 "cohort and nested case-control studies." The dose-response meta-analysis showed a generally linear, inverse relationship between 25(OH)D levels and metabolic syndrome in the cross-sectional studies (P for linear trend < .001).

* CONCLUSIONS: Blood vitamin D levels were associated with a risk of metabolic syndrome in cross-sectional studies but not in longitudinal studies. Randomized, clinical trials will be necessary to address the issue of causality and to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is effective for the prevention of metabolic syndrome.

* I highly recommend reading Dr. Richard Johnson's book The Fat Switch (2012)

* Johnson: metabolic syndrome really should be called the fat-storage condition, because it’s just fat storage.

* [Johnson video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1afyKN18S0) March 2014

* Humans share the genes with other animals which use fructose to store fat

* However, humans lack the ability to turn off the "fat switch" (most hypernating animals)

* Recommends < 25 grams of frutose, and for some people < 15 grams
