### Placenta appears to be better able to protect the fetus due to increased Vitamin D

* Reduce [Miscarriage](/posts/miscarriage-in-first-trimester-25x-more-likely-if-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d)   **<span style="color:#00F;">2.5 times</span>**

### Dr. Coimbra (Brazil) on Placenta and Virus – Feb 2016 (clipped from email)

[Dr. Coimbra has cured 1,000 patients of Multiple Sclerosis using LOTS of vitamin D](/posts/autoimmune-disorder-patients-in-brazil-helped-by-vitamin-d-video-and-facebook)

* “ . . vitamin D promotes the expression of innate immunity (efficient against microorganisms in general), both in cells of the immune system as the placenta (enabling the function of the placenta as an effective barrier against the passage of germs into the body of the embryo / fetus )”

* Vitamin D . . . the only preventative measure proposed to prevent dengue infections transmitted by the same mosquito”

### HIV in infant 2X less likely if 32+ ng/mL of vitamin D – 2009

 **Perinatal Outcomes, Including Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, and Child Mortality and Their Association with Maternal Vitamin D Status in Tanzania** 

The Journal of Infectious Diseases Volume 200, Issue 7 Pp. 1022-1030

Background Vitamin D is a strong immunomodulator and may protect against adverse pregnancy outcomes,  **mother-to-child transmission (MTCT)**  of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and child mortality

Methods A total of 884 HIV-infected pregnant women who were participating in a vitamin supplementation trial in Tanzania were monitored to assess pregnancy outcomes and child mortality. The association of these outcomes with maternal vitamin D status at enrollment was examined in an observational analysis

Results No association was observed between maternal vitamin D status and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm birth. 

In multivariate models, a low maternal vitamin D level  **(<32 ng/mL) was associated with a 50% higher risk**  (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 2%–120%) of MTCT of HIV at 6 weeks, a 2-fold higher risk of MTCT of HIV through breast-feeding among children who were HIV uninfected at 6 weeks (95% CI, 1.08–3.82), and a 46% higher overall risk of HIV infection (95% CI, 11%–91%). Children born to women with a low vitamin D level had a 61% higher risk of dying during follow-up (95% CI, 25%–107%)

Conclusions If found to be efficacious in randomized trials, vitamin D supplementation could prove to be an inexpensive method of reducing the burden of HIV infection and death among children, particularly in resource-limited settings
