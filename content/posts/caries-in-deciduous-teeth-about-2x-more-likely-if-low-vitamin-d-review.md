#### Examining the Role of Vitamin D in Caries Susceptibility in Children's Deciduous Teeth: A Systematic Review

Nutrients. 2023 Nov 18;15(22):4826. [doi: 10.3390/nu15224826.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15224826.)

The global prevalence of dental caries in deciduous teeth remains a significant health concern, affecting almost 70% of children by the age of six in specific regions. This systematic review aspired to methodically investigate the association between vitamin D levels and susceptibility to caries in children's deciduous teeth. A detailed search, guided by the PRISMA and PROSPERO guidelines, was conducted across three prominent electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, culminating in August 2023. The search integrated various keywords related to vitamin D and dental caries in primary dentition, yielding an initial pool of 1678 articles. After meticulous scrutiny, seven studies with a total of 7655 participants were deemed suitable for inclusion. The studies represented diverse geographical regions, showcasing varied vitamin D levels and sun exposure. Patient habits like brushing frequency, dental visits, and vitamin consumption also varied across studies. The analysis pinpointed vitamin D deficiency as a potential risk factor in some of the studies, with Odds Ratios (OR) ranging from 0.68 to 2.15. 

Statistically significant associations between vitamin D deficiency and caries susceptibility were documented in three studies  **(ORs of 2.15, 1.98, and 1.70)** 

. This comprehensive review elucidates the complex relationship between vitamin D levels and dental caries in children's deciduous teeth. While some studies spotlight vitamin D's pivotal role in dental health, inconsistencies across studies and regional differences necessitate more in-depth, globally representative investigations. Ensuring optimal vitamin D levels may play an integral role in dental health strategies. However, it is important to highlight that the roles of these studied factors might differ in deciduous teeth compared to permanent teeth.
