#### Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk.

Dietary cholesterol comes exclusively from animal sources, thus it is naturally present in our diet and tissues. 

 **It is an important component of cell membranes and a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones and vitamin D** .

Contrary to phytosterols (originated from plants), cholesterol is synthesised in the human body in order to maintain a stable pool when dietary intake is low. 

Given the necessity for cholesterol, very effective intestinal uptake mechanisms and enterohepatic bile acid and cholesterol reabsorption cycles exist; conversely, phytosterols are poorly absorbed and, indeed, rapidly excreted. 

 **Dietary cholesterol content does not significantly influence plasma cholesterol values** , which are regulated by different genetic and nutritional factors that influence cholesterol absorption or synthesis. Some subjects are hyper-absorbers and others are hyper-responders, which implies new therapeutic issues. 

 **Epidemiological data do not support a link between dietary cholesterol and CVD** . 

Recent biological data concerning the effect of dietary cholesterol on LDL receptor-related protein may explain the complexity of the effect of cholesterol on CVD risk.
