Furthermore, a significant portion of the population has deficient or inadequate blood</p><p>levels of vitamin D to promote health and prevent chronic diseases, such as poor bone health and</p><p>possibly certain types of cancers, cardiovascular disease, and immune-related disorders. This is</p><p>especially apparent in people living in northern latitudes, in persons with dark skin, and in</p><p>overweight and obese adults.</p><p>All children, adults, and the elderly are encouraged to meet the AI for vitamin D by</p><p>consuming vitamin D-rich foods in both naturally occurring and fortified forms. Children, adults,</p><p>and the elderly with deficient or inadequate blood levels of vitamin D should consume more</p><p>vitamin D-rich foods. If necessary, individuals may consider vitamin D supplementation if they</p><p>are having difficulty meeting the AI through vitamin D-rich foods.</p><p>The DGAC chose not to conduct an independent systematic review of vitamin D due to the</p><p>fact that the IOM concurrently empanelled an expert committee to review the DRI for vitamin D.</p><p>The previous DRI for vitamin D was established in 1997. The IOM empanelled the committee</p><p>because significant new and relevant research had become available to review the existing DRI for</p><p>vitamin D (Yetley, 2009). Recommendations from the IOM committee are expected to be available</p><p>in Fall 2010.</p><p>For this review of vitamin D and health, the DGAC primarily relied upon three different</p><p>sources of information: 1) vitamin D intake data from the NHANES (Bailey, 2010a); 2) an American</p><p>Journal of Clinical Nutrition (AJCN) supplement (Brannon et al, 2008a) that presented findings from</p><p>two sources, including proceedings from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference</p><p>“Vitamin D and Health in the 21st Century: An Update” held in September 2007 and an NIH</p><p>roundtable discussion with expert scientists held after the conference (Brannon et al, 2008b); and 3)</p><p>an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence report, Vitamin D and Calcium: A</p><p>Systematic Review of Health Outcomes (Chung, 2009) prepared for use by the 2009-2010 IOM</p><p>committee. The results of the DGAC’s review are presented below.</p><p>Vitamin D and health: Adequate vitamin D status, which depends upon dietary intake and</p><p>cutaneous synthesis, is important for health (Brannon et al, 2008a). Well-established research</p><p>demonstrates the importance of vitamin D for bone health. Vitamin D deficiency results in rickets in</p><p>children and osteomalacia in adults (Brannon et al, 2008a). In adults and older adults, adequate</p><p>vitamin D reduces risk of fractures (Looker, 2010). Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D is</p><p>important for other body systems (Brannon et al, 2008a; Nutrition Reviews, 2007). Emerging research</p><p>has shown a reduced risk for type 1 diabetes, some cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infectious</p><p>diseases (Brannon, 2008b; Chung, 2009). Further well-designed, dose-response research is needed to</p><p>fully establish the relationship between vitamin D and many of these outcomes (Chung, 2009).</p><p>Vitamin D intake: Results from 2003-2006 NHANES data indicate that the majority of the</p><p>population does not meet the AI for vitamin D (Bailey, 2010a). With diet alone, less than 10 percent</p><p>of men and women older than 50 years meet the AI, and less than 2 percent of adults older than 70</p><p>years meet the AI (10ug/day for 51 to 70 years of age; 15ug /day for 71 years of age and older)</p><p>(Figure D2.16). Approximately 47 percent and 53 percent, respectively, of adolescent girls and boys</p><p>older than 9 years meet the AI. About 53 percent and 67 percent of girls and boys, respectively, aged</p><p>4 to 8 years, meet the AI (5ug /day). The only population subgroup that comes close to meeting the</p><p>AI with diet alone, due to fluid milk consumption, is children, with 70 percent and 72 percent of</p><p>girls and boys, respectively, aged 1 to 3 years, meeting the AI of 5 g per day.</p><p>When supplements are added to dietary intake, the percentage of children and adults who meet</p><p>the AI improves. Thirty-seven percent of the population consumes supplements that contain</p><p>vitamin D. However, even with combined dietary intakes and supplementation, a majority of adults</p><p>still do not meet the AI:</p><p>less than 50 percent of men and women, aged 19 to 30 years;</p><p>less than 60 percent of men and women, aged 31 to 50 years;</p><p>less than 45 percent of adults older than 50 years; and</p><p>less than 25 percent of adults older than 70 years.</p><p><strong>Less than 1 percent of the population exceeds the UL for vitamin D intake</strong> (Bailey, 2010a).</p><p>These vitamin D intakes are compared against the 1997 AI for vitamin D. Should the IOM</p><p>determine new AIs for vitamin D, comparisons of intakes to AI standards should be adjusted</p><p>accordingly.</p><p>Vitamin D status: The criterion used by the IOM for setting the AI in 1997 was the normal</p><p>level of serum 25(OH)D concentration, an indicator of vitamin D status. The 1997 25(OH)D</p><p>criterion of greater than or equal to <strong>27.5 nmol/L</strong> for children up to age 18 years and greater than or</p><p>equal to 30 nmol/L for adults aged 19 years and older set by the IOM was based upon associations</p><p>with bone growth in children and normal parathyroid concentrations in adults. This criterion has</p><p>been brought into question based on new information on the relationship of serum 25(OH)D to</p><p>health, the relationship of vitamin D intake to serum 25(OH)D concentration, vitamin D status of</p><p>the US population, and safety of vitamin D status, as summarized in the September 2008</p><p>supplement of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and elsewhere (Dawson-Hughes, 2005;</p><p>Norman, 2007). The DGAC expects that the IOM empanelled committee will carefully evaluate the</p><p>criteria for determining deficient, marginal or insufficient, and adequate serum vitamin D</p><p>concentrations. Until a determination is made by the IOM panel, the DGAC must independently</p><p>consider published evidence of potential thresholds for adequacy regarding health outcomes and</p><p>implications related to food guidance.</p><p>Contributing scientists to the 2007 NIH roundtable discussion used the following cutoff points</p><p>to evaluate vitamin D adequacy: less than 27.5 nmol/L, less than 50 nmol/L, and less than 75</p><p>nmol/L when analyzing blood samples from the 2002-2004 NHANES (Yetley, 2008).</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of people aged 12 years and older had serum 25(OH)D levels lower than</p><p>50 nmol/L. For children, aged 1 to 11 years, approximately 15 percent had serum 25(OH)D levels</p><p>lower than 50 nmol/L. Slightly more women than men had serum 25(OH)D concentrations lower</p><p>than 50 nmol/L. Yetley (2008) further reported an inverse association of body fatness and BMI on</p><p>serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Leaner women, regardless of the method used to assess body</p><p>fatness, had higher concentrations of serum 25(OH)D. A more recent evaluation in children, aged 1</p><p>to 11 years, using 2001-2006 NHANES findings reported that 18 percent of children in this age</p><p>range had serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 50 nmol/L (Mansbach, 2009). An even higher</p><p>percentage of non-Hispanic black and Hispanic children had serum 25(OH)D concentrations below</p><p>50 nmol/L.</p><p>These data should be interpreted with caution because of lingering questions related to</p><p>measurement drift from assay method changes and completeness of data (Looker, 2008; Yetley,</p><p>2008). However, using the NHANES values, after adjusting for an apparent measurement drift,</p><p>serum 25(OH)D concentrations for the US population were lower in the years 2000 to 2004 than in</p><p>1988 to 1994 (Looker, 2008). In adults, increases in BMI, reductions in fluid milk intakes, and</p><p>increases in sun protection appeared to contribute to this decline (Looker, 2008).</p><p>Sources of vitamin D: Vitamin D can be obtained through dietary sources, cutaneous</p><p>synthesis, and supplementation. Fatty fish, such as salmon and herring, is the primary natural food</p><p>source of vitamin D. Based on 2005-2006 NHANES data, fish and shellfish provide 8.6 percent of</p><p>the vitamin D intake in the US. All fluid milk must be fortified with vitamin D, and other foods</p><p>(e.g., cereals, margarine, and yogurt) and beverages (e.g., orange juice) are also commonly fortified.</p><p>The best sources of vitamin D include fortified fluid milk, fatty fish such as salmon and trout,</p><p>portabella mushrooms, and fortified orange juice (Table D2.10). Slightly more than 52 percent of</p><p>the total intake comes from vitamin D-fortified fluid milk, milk drinks and desserts, and yogurt</p><p>(Table D2.11). Fortified cereals account for an additional 6.5 percent of intake, and meat, poultry,</p><p>and eggs together account for 11.2 percent. Various vitamin D-fortified foods differ in the amounts</p><p>of vitamin D that they contain.</p><p>The USDA Food Patterns include vitamin D from fortified fluid milk, fortified ready-to-eat</p><p>cereals, fortified butter and margarine, and the naturally occurring vitamin D in meat, poultry, fish,</p><p>and eggs. The food patterns that contain 3 cup equivalents from the fluid milk and milk products</p><p>food group provide sufficient vitamin D to meet the current AI for all children and adults, aged 19</p><p>to 50 years (i.e., 5 ug/day). However, the patterns do not provide sufficient vitamin D for adults</p><p>over 50 years (i.e., 10 ug/day). The food patterns at 1000 to 1400 calories that contain only 2 cup</p><p>equivalents from the fluid milk and milk products group do not provide adequate vitamin D to meet</p><p>the AI of 5 ug/day for children, aged 2 to 8 years. Additional vitamin D could be obtained by</p><p>selecting more natural food sources of vitamin D, such as certain fish, and fortified sources of</p><p>vitamin D, such as fortified orange juice. In addition, choosing fortified fluid milk or yogurt rather</p><p>than including cheese or non-fortified yogurt when making selections from the fluid milk and milk</p><p>products food group would increase vitamin D intakes to adequate amounts for all age-sex groups,</p><p>except those over 70 years of age. When necessary, individuals may consider vitamin D</p><p>supplementation along with dietary intake, especially in older individuals because endogenous</p><p>production of vitamin D from sun exposure is reduced by more than 50 percent in elderly</p><p>populations.</p><p>t</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>About D - more info.</span>
