Vitamin D (VD) is an essential micronutrient with multiple functions for human growth, and adequate intake should be guaranteed throughout life. However, VD insufficiency is observed in infants all over the world. Low VD concentration in the breast milk of non-supplemented mothers and low compliance to VD daily supplementation are the main causes of VD insufficiency, especially in the long term. Furthermore, VD supplementation dosages are still debated and differ by country. We conducted a systematic review to compare the most recent evidence on different postnatal VD supplementation strategies, determining whether supplementation given to the mother is as effective as that administered directly to the child, and whether different dosages and administration schedules differ significantly in terms of efficacy and safety. We identified 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing the role of infant (n = 961), maternal (n = 652) or combined infant and maternal VD supplementation (n = 260 pairs). In all studies, similar outcomes emerged in terms of efficacy and safety. According to our findings, alternative approaches of VD supplementation may be adopted, especially in cases where the adherence to daily supplementation strategies is poor. This review shows that different dosages and supplementation strategies result in similar VD sufficiency rates. Therefore, international guidelines may be revised in the future to offer multiple and different options of supplementation for specific settings and ages.

##### Adding Vitamin D should not stop after age 1, after rickets, after no-longer a premie

Some counrties cease giving free Vitamin D at age 1

Most countries incorrectly cease giving extra Vitamin D once rickets has been cured

---

##### Dose size should increase as weight increases

---

##### Very similar benefits and safety with daily, weekly, and once every two weeks
