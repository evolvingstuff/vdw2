#### VDR  and Cancer risk - meta-analysis July 2009

 **Review and meta-analysis on vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and cancer risk 

Sara Raimondi, Harriet Johansson, Patrick Maisonneuve, Sara Gandini

Carcinogenesis, Volume 30, Issue 7, July 2009, Pages 1170–1180, https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgp103

It was suggested that vitamin D levels influence cancer development. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a crucial mediator for the cellular effects of vitamin D. Results from previous studies on the association of VDR polymorphisms with different cancer types are somewhat contradictory, and the role of VDR in the etiology of cancer is still equivocal. We therefore performed a meta-analysis on the association between the two most studied VDR polymorphisms ( FokI and BsmI ) and any cancer site. Up to January 2009, we identified 67 independent studies. We used random-effects models to provide summary odds ratio (SOR) for VDR polymorphisms and cancer. We tested homogeneity of effects across studies and publication bias and explored between-study heterogeneity. When comparing FokI ff with FF carriers, we found a significant increase in skin cancer <span>[SOR; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.30; 1.04–1.61]</span> and breast cancer (SOR; 95%CI: 1.14; 1.03–1.27) risk. For the same genotype comparison, we found a significantly higher risk of cancer when we pooled estimates from cancer sites possibly associated with vitamin D levels (prostate, breast, skin, ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and colorectal). A significant reduction in prostate cancer risk was observed for carriers of BsmI Bb compared with bb genotype (SOR; 95%CI: 0.83; 0.69–0.99). In Caucasian populations, both Bb and BB carriers had a significant reduced risk of cancer at any site.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that VDR FokI and BsmI polymorphisms might modulate the risk of** cancer of breast, skin and prostate **and possibly affect cancer risk at any site in Caucasians.

#### Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphisms and Cancer (Book Chapter) - 2020

Sunlight, Vitamin D and Skin Cancer pp 53-114

Part of the Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology book series (AEMB, volume 1268)

Increasing scientific evidence supports the link between vitamin D and cancer risk. The active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D exerts its activity by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), an intracellular receptor that mediates transcriptional activation and repression of target genes. The binding of 1,25(OH)2D to VDR is able to regulate hundreds of different genes. VDR is active in virtually all tissues including the colon, breast, lung, ovary, bone, kidney, parathyroid gland, pancreatic b-cells, monocytes, T lymphocytes, melanocytes, keratinocytes, and also cancer cells.

The relevance of VDR gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms for various types of cancer has been investigated by a great number of studies.

We have carried out a systematic review of the literature to analyze the relevance of more VDR polymorphisms (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1, and Cdx2) for individual malignancies considering ethnicity as a key factor for heterogeneity.

Up to December 2018, we identified 176 independent studies with data to assess the risk of breast, prostate, colorectal, skin (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer), lung, ovarian, kidney, bladder, gallbladder, esophageal, thyroid, head and neck, liver and pancreatic cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma and sarcoma.

Significant associations with VDR polymorphisms have been reported for prostate (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1, Cdx2), breast (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1, CdX2), colorectal (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1, Apa1), and skin cancer (Fok1, Bsm1, Taq1). Very few studies reported risk estimates for the other cancer sites.

Conflicting data have been reported for most malignancies, and at present, it is still not possible to make any definitive statements about the importance of the VDR genotype for cancer risk. It seems probable that other factors such as ethnicity, phenotype, 25(OH)D plasma levels, and UV radiation exposure play a role as confounding factors and introduce heterogeneity.

To conclude, there is some indication that VDR polymorphisms may modulate the risk of some cancer sites and in future studies VDR genetic variation should be integrated also with assessment of vitamin D status and stratified by ethnicity.

#### 59% increased Breast Cancer survival if good VDR - meta-analysis Nov 2020** Prognostic role of vitamin D receptor in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis **Volume 20, article number 1051, (2020)

Haiyan Xu, Zhenhua Liu, Hongtai Shi & Chunbin Wang 

Background

A higher vitamin D intake improves the prognosis of early stage breast cancer (BC) patients. We hypothesized that vitamin D intake should refer to vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression. In order to prove this hypothesis, we first intend to evaluate the correlation between VDR expression and prognosis of BC patients using meta-analysis.

Methods

Literatures from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (last update by May 20, 2020) were retrieved to find studies assessing the prognostic role of VDR in BC. The hazard ratios (HRs) for patients’ survival were extracted for pooled analyses. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity.

Results

Seven articles containing eight studies with 2503 patients were enrolled. The results from the pooled analyses showed that the VDR expression generally had no relationship with BC patients’ overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) (P > 0.05). Because only the number of studies exploring the relationship between VDR expression and OS is greater than five and there is heterogeneity, we explored the sources of heterogeneity of these studies. Subgroup analyses showed that the VDR expression in the nucleus had no relationship with OS, but high total VDR expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm was related to a better OS (pooled HR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.18–0.95; P = 0.038). In addition, in subgroup of studies using cut-off values other than ‘immunoreactive score (IRS)>5’ and ‘IRS > 25′, high VDR expression was associated with a better OS (pooled HR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.30–0.74; P = 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that the result pattern was not obviously affected by any single study. Meta-regression showed that the source of heterogeneity was not country (P = 0.657), pathological type (P = 0.614), molecular type (P = 0.423), staining location (P = 0.481), or cut-off value (P = 0.509).

Conclusions

The protein expression level of VDR in entire BC cells evaluated by immunohistochemistry is related to the OS of BC patients. It is expected that a more individualized vitamin D intake and a more accurate prognosis assessment can be recommended for BC patients based on the VDR expression. Of course, more preclinical and clinical studies are needed.
