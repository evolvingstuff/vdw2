* Fact #1: The Infection Fatality Rate for COVID-19 is somewhere between 0.07-0.20%, in line with seasonal flu

* Fact #2: The risk of dying from COVID-19 is much higher than the average IFR for older people and those with co-morbidities, and much lower than the average IFR for younger healthy people, and nearing zero for children

* Fact #3: People infected with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic (which is most people) do NOT spread COVID-19

* Fact #4: Emerging science shows no spread of COVID-19 in the community (shopping, restaurants, barbers, etc.)

* Fact #5: Published science shows COVID-19 is NOT spread outdoors

* Fact #6: Science shows masks are ineffective to halt the spread of COVID-19, and The WHO recommends they should only be worn by healthy people if treating or living with someone with a COVID-19 infection

* Fact #7: There’s no science to support the magic of a six-foot barrier

* Fact #8: The idea of locking down an entire society had never been done and has no supportable science, only theoretical modeling

* Fact #9: The epidemic models of COVID-19 have been disastrously wrong, and both the people and the practice of modeling has a terrible history

* Fact #10: The data shows that lockdowns have NOT had an impact on the course of the disease.

* Fact #11: Florida locked down late, opened early, and is doing fine, despite predictions of doom

* Fact #12: New York’s above average death rate appears to be driven by a fatal policy error combined with aggressive intubations.

* Fact #13: Public health officials and disease epidemiologists do NOT consider the other negative societal consequences of lockdowns

* Fact #14: There is a predictive model for the viral arc of COVID-19, it’s called Farr’s Law, and it was discovered over 100 years ago

* Fact #15: The lockdowns will cause more death and destruction than COVID-19 ever did

* Fact #16: All these phased re-openings are utter nonsense with no science to support them, but they will all be declared a success
