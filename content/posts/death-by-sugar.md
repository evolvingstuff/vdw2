#### Death By Sugar (Sugar = Diabetes) Dr. Dean May 2019

I’m finally finishing  **[Death by Sugar](https://drcarolyndean.com/2019/05/sugar-diabetes/)**  that I began writing in 1990. 

That book got me where I am today. 

When I talked about writing the book on a Canadian national TV show I set off a firestorm in the sugar industry. I guess it was because I spooned out 10 tsp of sugar into a dish to indicate the amount of sugar in a soda and 27 tsp for a milkshake. 

Such blatant exposure of sugar compelled a Canadian sugar lobby group to attack me through The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. The College, of course, is supposed to protect the public from harm, not protect an industry that is harming the public. But we all know we’re living in an Upsidedown World.

Dr. Dean made a 74-minute video in 2018  [Diabetes is Reversible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yXsr7JPZNQ) – with Magnesium, etc.

Gary Taubes in his book  **[The Case Against Sugar](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Sugar-Gary-Taubes-ebook/dp/B01DRXCPJ0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Case+Against+Sugar&qid=1557683807&s=gateway&sr=8-1)**  (2016 Amazon $3) wrote the following history of sugar and diabetes:

* In 1890, Robert Saundby, a former president of the Edinburgh Royal Medical Society, estimated that less than one in every fifty thousand died from the diabetes. William Osler, the legendary Canadian physician often described as the “father of modern medicine,” in his Principles and Practice of Medicine (1892) reported that, of the thirty-five thousand patients since the inception of Johns Hopkins Hospital, only ten had been diagnosed with diabetes. 

* By 2012, one in every 7-8 adults in this country had diabetes—12-14%. Another 30% are predicted to get diabetes at some point during their lives. Almost 2 million Americans were diagnosed with diabetes in 2012 – one case every 15-16 seconds. Among U.S. military veterans, one in every four patients admitted to VA hospitals suffers from diabetes.

> US Govt proposed a VOLUNTARY maximum of 26% sugar content for children's cereals

> However, ALL of the top 10 brands had > 26%

> Big Cereal paid (lobbied) $175,000,000 to kill the VOLUNTARY proposal

> "...they ought to be called cereal-flavored candy, rather than sugar-covered cereals."

> Kelloggs: "When you sell a woman a product and she goes into the store and finds your brand isn’t in stock, she will probably forget about it. But when you sell a kid on your product, if he can’t get it, he will throw himself in the floor, stamp his feet, and cry. You can’t get a reaction like that out of an adult.”
