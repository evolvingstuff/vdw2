#### Asked Perplexity AI: What are the differences between liposomal and micellized forms of supplements - June 2024

Liposomal and micellized forms of supplements are both advanced delivery systems designed to enhance the bioavailability and absorption of nutrients, but they differ significantly in their structure and mechanism of action.

 **Liposomal Supplements** 

Liposomal supplements utilize liposomes, which are tiny spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers. These bilayers encapsulate an aqueous core, allowing liposomes to carry both water-soluble and fat-soluble nutrients. The lipid bilayer structure of liposomes is similar to cell membranes, which facilitates the efficient delivery of nutrients into cells. Liposomal supplements are known for their high bioavailability because the liposome protects the nutrient from degradation in the digestive system and enhances its absorption into the bloodstream.Key characteristics of liposomal supplements:

*  **Structure** : Composed of lipid bilayers surrounding an aqueous core.

*  **Nutrient Compatibility** : Can carry both water-soluble and fat-soluble nutrients.

*  **Bioavailability** : High, due to protection from digestive degradation and efficient cellular uptake.

*  **Forms** : Available in liquids, capsules, soft gels, and powders.

 **Micellized Supplements** 

Micellized supplements use micelles, which are tiny lipid molecules that form a spherical structure in an aqueous environment. Micelles have a hydrophobic (water-repelling) core and a hydrophilic (water-attracting) exterior. This structure allows micelles to solubilize fat-soluble nutrients in water, enhancing their absorption. Micellization is particularly useful for making fat-soluble vitamins and other hydrophobic compounds more bioavailable by dispersing them in a water-soluble form.Key characteristics of micellized supplements:

*  **Structure** : Spherical lipid molecules with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior.

*  **Nutrient Compatibility** : Primarily used for fat-soluble nutrients.

*  **Bioavailability** : Enhanced by solubilizing fat-soluble nutrients in water, making them easier to absorb.

*  **Forms** : Typically found in liquid form, often recommended to be taken with food or beverages to improve absorption.

 **Comparison** 

*  **Structure** : Liposomes have a bilayer membrane, while micelles have a single-layer spherical structure.

*  **Nutrient Compatibility** : 

> Liposomes can carry both water-soluble and fat-soluble nutrients, whereas 

> micelles are mainly used for fat-soluble nutrients.

*  **Bioavailability** : Both forms enhance bioavailability, but through different mechanisms

> liposomes protect nutrients from digestive degradation, while 

> micelles solubilize fat-soluble nutrients in water.

*  **Forms** : Liposomal supplements are available in various forms (liquids, capsules, powders), 

> while micellized supplements are typically in liquid form.

In summary, both liposomal and micellized supplements offer superior absorption compared to traditional forms, but they are suited to different types of nutrients and use distinct mechanisms to enhance bioavailability.

#### Emulsified Omega-3 does NOT need a fatty meal: Perplexity AI - May 2024

No, emulsified omega-3 supplements do not need to be taken with fatty meals to be effectively absorbed. Emulsified omega-3 supplements are designed to enhance the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, without the need for concurrent high-fat meal consumption. This is achieved through the use of self-micro-emulsifying delivery systems (SMEDS) and other emulsification technologies that simulate the emulsification process of bile, facilitating the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids in the absence of dietary fats.

​

Research has shown that emulsified forms of omega-3 supplements can significantly increase the absorption of EPA and DHA compared to non-emulsified forms, even when consumed in a fasted state or with low-fat or no-fat meals. For instance, a study demonstrated that a novel SMEDS formulation of omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a more than 6-fold increase in absorption compared to control conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of emulsification in enhancing bioavailability under various dietary conditions [1](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0589-0).

​

Additionally, other studies have corroborated these findings, indicating that emulsified fish oil supplements lead to enhanced absorption of omega-3 fatty acids compared to traditional capsular forms, without the need for a high-fat meal [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465191/) [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701654/). This makes emulsified omega-3 supplements particularly beneficial for individuals who are advised to limit their fat intake or find it inconvenient to coordinate their supplement intake with fatty meals.

​

In summary, emulsified omega-3 supplements are specifically formulated to improve the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids without the necessity of accompanying fat intake, making them a convenient option for various dietary preferences and conditions [1](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0589-0) [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465191/)[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701654/).
