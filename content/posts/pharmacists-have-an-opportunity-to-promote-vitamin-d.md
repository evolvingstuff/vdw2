## Public health in pharmacy: Improving vitamin D status in the U.S. population.

J Am Pharm Assoc (2003). 2013 Mar 1;53(2):206-9. [doi: 10.1331/JAPhA.2013.12106.](https://doi.org/10.1331/JAPhA.2013.12106.)

OBJECTIVES To summarize the problem of vitamin D inadequacy in the United States and discuss how pharmacists can help improve vitamin D status in the population.

SUMMARY Vitamin D inadequacy has proven skeletal health effects and potential effects on other chronic conditions. The condition is present in many Americans. Adequate vitamin D intake is currently emphasized to prevent vitamin D inadequacy. However, overall dietary vitamin D intake and use of vitamin D supplements is relatively low in the United States. Pharmacists' health knowledge and placement in communities make them ideal resources for raising awareness on the benefits of vitamin D and providing nutrition information to prevent vitamin D inadequacy. However, pharmacists' ability to provide these services may be impeded in part by current limitations on compensation for health promotion activities. 

CONCLUSION Health care reform is likely to expand pharmacists' scope of practice and services eligible for reimbursement. 

By promoting vitamin D in the communities they serve, pharmacists can take a lead role among health professionals in addressing vitamin D inadequacy.
