“Fourteen of them stayed in the five-bedroom, two-bathroom house at varying lengths of time ranging from 8 to 25 days; they did not wear face masks or stay at least six feet apart from each other. “

“Of the 14 staying at the house, 12 of them, including the girl, came down with Covid-19, with the onset of symptoms appearing up to 18 days after the start of the gathering. Their ages ranged from 9 to 72. Not all of them were likely to have been directly infected by the girl; the virus may have been spread by several people in the house.”
