#### [Eggs Cannot Be Defined by Law](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/02/06/eggs-no-definition-rule.aspx?utm_source=dnl&utm_medium=email&utm_content=art3&utm_campaign=20180206Z1_UCM&et_cid=DM184747&et_rid=206432861) Mercola Feb 2018

* “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a rule that forbids the creation of a definition for eggs, stating “no regulation shall be promulgated fixing and establishing a reasonable definition and standard of identity for the food commonly known as eggs””

* Choline. . .was first officially recognized by the Institute of Medicine as an essential nutrient in 1998”

> The AI for adults is 550 mg/day of choline for men and 425 mg/day for women

* . . . “only 8 percent of U.S. adults are getting enough choline”

* Eat eggs: 57 % met the (AI) levels for choline, 

> Eat no eggs:  2.4 % have adequate intak of Choline

#### Fatty Liver Disease Is Triggered by Choline Deficiency -  March 2019

 **[Mercola](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/03/04/fatty-liver-choline-defiency.aspx)** 

* "An estimated 90 percent of the U.S. population are deficient in choline, a nutrient required to move fat out of your liver"

* "Choline deficiency appears to be a far more significant trigger of NAFLD than excess fructose, and the rise in NAFLD may be largely the result of the widespread avoidance of liver and egg yolks"

* "In the absence of sufficient choline, even healthy saturated fats can contribute to fatty liver. Choline minimizes liver fat no matter what the source, and the more dietary fat you consume — even if the fat itself is healthy — the higher your requirement for choline"

* "Studies in the 1930s demonstrated that lecithin in egg yolk (which contains high amounts of choline) could cure fatty liver disease in Type 1 diabetic dogs. They later found choline alone provided the same benefit"
