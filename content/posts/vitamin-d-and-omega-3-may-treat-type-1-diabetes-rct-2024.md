#### [Pilot Study of OMEGA-3 and Vitamin D in High-Dose in Type I Diabetic Patients (POSEIDON)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03406897?term=Poseidon&rank=6)

 **It has been hinted that their goal is to get participants to a vitamin D level of <span style="color:#00F;">40 ng</span>, which would be great!**
