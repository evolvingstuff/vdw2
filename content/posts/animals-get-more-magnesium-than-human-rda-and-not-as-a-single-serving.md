#### Humans, as well as most animals, do no get the recommended daily intake at one time of

* Water

* Food

* Magnesium

> The intestines just cannot process it all at once.

> In animals, as well as humans, the daily amount of Magnesium all at once causes diarrhea.

### Adjusted for an animal (human) weighing 200 lbs the amount of Magnesium  needed is

* 1000 mg – beef cattle

* 3000 mg – dairy cattle

* 800 mg – monkey

### [Horses ](http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/metabolic_disorders/disorders_of_magnesium_metabolism/magnesium_as_an_equine_dietary_supplement.html?qt=magnesium&alt=sh) Merck Manual

Horse: 13 mg/kg body wt/day 200 lb horse/human = 2,600 mg/day

### [Mineral Supplements for Beef Cattle](http://extension.missouri.edu/p/g2081) University of Missouri Extension

Cattle need about 0.04 to 0.1 % magnesium in the dry matter of their ration. (assuming lots in the feed)

Assuming a human eats 1 kg of food per day 0.1% would be 1000 mg of Magnesium element

### [Mineral and Vitamin Nutrition of Dairy Cattle](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1440&context=extensionhist) Nebraska

0.2 – 0.25% of dry food – about 3X of Beef cattle 

### [Nutrition in Primates](http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/management_and_nutrition/nutrition_exotic_and_zoo_animals/nutrition_in_primates.html) Merick

0.08% of dry feed ==>  800 mg of Magnesium for a 200 lb human

### [Cat Food Standards by the AAFCO - 2008](*[http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2244&aid=657)

0.04%  dry feed ==>  400 mg of Magnesium for a 200 lb human
