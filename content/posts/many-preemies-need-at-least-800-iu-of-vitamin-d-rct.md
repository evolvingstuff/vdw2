Preterm infants may need 800 IU of vitamin D3 per day</h2>

<p>

<br />

The American Academy of Pediatrics PAS MEETING UPDATE:</p>

<p>

Carla Kemp, Senior Editor</p>

<p>

Preterm infants may need to be given 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day to ensure they develop strong bones, according to a study to be presented Sunday, May 5, at the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) annual meeting in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>

Preemies are known to be at risk for vitamin D insufficiency. If levels of vitamin D are too low, infants and children can get rickets, which leads to softening and weakening of the bones.</p>

<p>

Recommendations from medical organizations on how much vitamin D should be given to preemies range from 400 IU to 1000 IU per day.<br />

This lack of consensus prompted researchers from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, to conduct the largest study to date on vitamin D supplementation in preterm infants.</p>

<p>

Subjects included 96 infants born between 28 and 34 weeks’ gestation who were receiving milk feeding. Blood samples were taken from the infants to determine their serum vitamin D levels.<br />

The infants then were randomly assigned to receive either 800 IU or 400 IU of oral vitamin D3.<br />

Neither the parents nor the primary investigator was aware of which dose the infants were receiving.</p>

<p>

Researchers compared whether the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) at 40 weeks and at 3 months corrected age differed between the groups.<br />

They also looked at whether infants with higher vitamin D levels also had stronger bones at 3 months corrected age and whether supplementation led to vitamin D levels that were too high.</p>

<p>

Results showed that VDI was common in both groups before they received supplements (79% of the 800 IU group and 83% of the 400 IU group).</p>

<p>

After supplementation, the prevalence of VDI at 40 weeks was 43% lower in the 800 IU group than the 400 IU group (38% vs. 67%). In addition,<br />

VDI was significantly lower in the 800 IU group when the infants were 3 months old (12% vs. 35%).</p>

<p>

Four infants needed to be supplemented with 800 IU daily to reduce one case of vitamin D insufficiency, said lead author Chandra Kumar Natarajan, DM.</p>

<p>

“The study results show conclusively that in preterm infants with high rates of vitamin D insufficiency at baseline, supplementation with 800 IU of vitamin D3 per day compared to 400 IU per day reduces vitamin D insufficiency at term equivalent age and at 3 months,” Dr. Natarajan said. “There also is a trend toward a decrease in the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency even in the 400 IU group at 3 months. Therefore, 400 IU per day may be sufficient after 3 months.”</p>

<p>

Despite significant improvement in serum vitamin D levels in the 800 IU group, higher levels did not result in better bone mineralization at 3 months of age as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. In addition, weight, length and head circumference did not differ significantly between the groups.</p>

<p>

Dr. Natarajan also noted that one infant in the 800 IU group had vitamin D levels that were higher than recommended levels at 3 months of age despite the levels at term age being normal. Excess vitamin D for at least one month can cause decreased muscle tone, decreased appetite, irritability and constipation, among other problems. The infant did not experience any major effects.</p>

<p>

“The incidence of vitamin D excess in the 800 IU group may indicate the need for monitoring vitamin D levels in infants on vitamin D supplementation, but we need larger studies to answer this,” he said. “Similarly, larger studies with longer duration of follow-up may be needed to find out any meaningful difference in clinical outcomes such as bone mineralization.”</p>

BACKGROUND: Consensus is lacking in regard to the dose of vitamin D supplementation required for preterm infants given the paucity of evidence. AAP, ESPGHAN and WHO have recommended different dosages of vitamin D ranging from 400 IU to 1000 IU per day.<br />

OBJECTIVE: <strong> Primary</strong> To compare the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (VDI; serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D &lt;20 ng/mL) at 40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) in preterm infants of 28 to 34 weeks' gestation randomized to receive 800 IU or 400 IU of oral vitamin D{SUB()}3{SUB} per day. <strong>Secondary </strong> To compare the (1) prevalence of VDI at 3m corrected age (CA), (2) incidence of vitamin D toxicity, as assessed by urine calcium creatinine ratio (UCa/Cr) for hypercalciuria and renal ultrasound for nephrocalcinosis during therapy and (3) bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at 3m CA.<br />

DESIGN/METHODS: In this randomized double blind trial, we allocated infants to 800 IU/ day or 400 IU/day of oral vitamin D{SUB()}3{SUB} (n=48 in both groups) from the time of full enteral feeds until 3m CA. UCa/Cr in a spot sample and renal ultrasound were performed both at 40 weeks PMA and 3m CA while DEXA was done at 3m CA.<br />

RESULTS: The prevalence of VDI in '800 IU group' was significantly lower than '400 IU group' at 40 weeks and at 3m CA.<br />

One infant (2.4%, 95% CI: 0.06 to 12.5) in the '800 IU group' had vitamin D excess (100 to 150 ng/mL) at 3m CA. Spot UCa/Cr ratio &gt;0.8 mg/mg did not differ significantly at 40 weeks (64% vs. 45%) and at 3m CA (15.4% vs. 20.8%). Nephrocalcinosis was not found in any of the cases. BMC (mean (SD): 79.6 (16.8) vs. 84.7 (20.7) g; p=0.27) and BMD (0.152 (0.019) vs. 0.158 (0.021) g/cm<sup>2</sup>;p=0.26) were not different between the groups.<br />

CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with 800 IU of vitamin D reduces the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency at 40 weeks and at 3 m CA in preterm infants without having any improvement in bone mineralization. However there is a possibility that this dose may result in vitamin D excess in minority of supplemented infants.<br />
