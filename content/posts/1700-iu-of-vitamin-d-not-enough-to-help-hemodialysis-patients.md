BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Observational studies suggest that calciferol supplementation may improve laboratory and patient-level outcomes of hemodialysis patients with reduced 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels. This randomized controlled trial examined effects of cholecalciferol supplementation in patients on hemodialysis.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Sixty patients with 25(OH)D levels ≤24 ng/ml (≤60 nmol/L) were randomized to receive 50,000 IU oral cholecalciferol or placebo, once weekly for 8 weeks and then monthly for 4 months. At baseline (autumn 2011) and 6 months, testing evaluated muscle strength, functional capacity, laboratory parameters, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 survey.

RESULTS: Patients were well matched by treatment allocation. Median age was 62 years (range, 20-86), 52% were women,  **55% had a history of diabetes** , and mean serum 25(OH)D was 17±5 ng/ml (43±13 nmol/L). Patients were assessed over 6 months by repeated-measures ANOVA. Patients allocated to cholecalciferol had significantly higher values of 25(OH)D (P<0.001), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P=0.04), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b) (P=0.04) and a greater reduction in phosphorus values (P=0.03) than placebo-treated patients Values of serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia did not differ significantly between the groups. No significant differences were detected in muscle strength, functional capacity, PWV, or HRQOL.

CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled trial, patients supplemented with cholecalciferol had higher 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b levels, without increased calcium or phosphorus values. However, no effects were detected in muscle strength, functional capacity, PWV, or HRQOL.
