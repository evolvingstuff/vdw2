### The following is the portion of the 2008 text concerning MS and vitamin D

The  incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) varies with  latitude. Ebers has co-ordinated a study <sup>[46]</sup>  that examined more than 40,000 Canadian, British, Danish and Swedish patients with  multiple sclerosis.  The  results  show that in the  Northern hemisphere,  significantly fewer (8.5%)  people with   MS  were born in  November and  significantly more (9.1%)   were  born  in  May.   In  the   Southern hemisphere, the  situation is  reversed and November is  the  peak month  and May  the  lowest. There are  several clues as to  the cause. An important study <sup>[47]</sup>  compared the  risk  of  two or  more siblings having multiple sclerosis to  the  risk  of its occurrence  in  both  twins in  a  non-identical pair.   There should  be  no    difference,  but    non-identical twins  do have   a   significantly  higher  risk    of   both   having   MS than  non-twin siblings. This   suggests  that the   pre-natal and post-natal environment affects the   overall risk. Pinpointing  the    actual  environmental factor  has  been problematic.

Correlations have been made between the  incidence  of MS, the  availability of dietary vitamin D, and the  availability of   sunlight  to   drive   vitamin  D3  synthesis.  In  Japanese populations, who  consume plenty of fish  rich  in vitamin  D (90%  of  the  Japanese  vitamin D requirement comes from fish,  3%  from  eggs and 3%  from  milk), the  MS prevalence is three per 100,000 population. MS has a very low frequency in equatorial regions where, it is argued, there is plenty of sunlight to drive  vitamin D3 synthesis in the  skin,  whilst  the incidence  of  MS  increases  dramatically with   latitude  in both hemispheres. In Scotland (in the  north) and Tasmania (in the  south), the  prevalence is 250 per  100,000 population. Such  arguments  have  also  been  used  to   explain  two peculiar geographic  anomalies on  MS  frequency,  one  in Switzerland with  high  MS rates at low altitudes and low MS rates at high  altitudes, and one in Norway with  a high  MS prevalence inland and a lower   MS  prevalence along the coast. Ultraviolet light intensity is higher at high altitudes, resulting in a greater vitamin D3  synthetic rate, thereby accounting for low MS rates at higher altitudes. On the  Norwegian  coast, fish  is consumed at high  rates and fish  oils  are rich in vitamin D3 <sup>[48]</sup>.
