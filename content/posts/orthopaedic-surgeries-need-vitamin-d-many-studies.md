#### Infections after bone surgery are associated with low vitamin D - Review Sept 2021

 **The role of Vitamin D in orthopaedic infection: a systematic literature review** 

Bone Jt Open . 2021 Sep;2(9):721-727. [doi: 10.1302/2633-1462.29.BJO-2020-0192.R1.](https://doi.org/10.1302/2633-1462.29.BJO-2020-0192.R1.)

Aims: Orthopaedic infection is a potentially serious complication of elective and emergency trauma and orthopaedic procedures, with a high associated burden of morbidity and cost. Optimization of vitamin D levels has been postulated to be beneficial in the prevention of orthopaedic infection. This study explores the role of vitamin D in orthopaedic infection through a systematic review of available evidence.

Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted on databases including Medline and Embase, as well as grey literature such as Google Scholar and The World Health Organization Database. Pooled analysis with weighted means was undertaken.

Results: Pooled analysis of four studies including 651 patients found the mean 25(OH)D level to be 50.7 nmol/l with a mean incidence of infection of 70%. There was a paucity of literature exploring prophylactic 25(OH)D supplementation on reducing orthopaedic infection, however, there was evidence of association between low 25(OH)D levels and increased incidence of orthopaedic infection.

Conclusion: The results indicate a significant proportion of orthopaedic patients have low 25(OH]D levels, as well as an association between low 25(OH)D levels and orthopaedic infection, but more randomized controlled trials need to be conducted to establish the benefit of prophylactic supplementation and the optimum regimen by dose and time

Haines et al 11 completed a  **randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial**  of 113 adults with long-bone fractures, where patients in the intervention group were given a  **single dose of 100,000 IU of vitamin D orally**  within two weeks of their injury found that 

infection occurred in 

* 2% of the control group (n = 1/50) and 

* none of the intervention group.

Introduction: Vitamin D plays an important role in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. Here, we review the most current literature on vitamin D as it relates to orthopaedic surgery and the musculoskeletal system, focusing largely on non-fracture applications.

Materials and methods: A literature review was performed on the basic science of vitamin D metabolism, epidemiology of vitamin D levels, role of vitamin D within the musculoskeletal system, and the correlation of vitamin D with injuries and orthopaedic surgical outcomes.

Results: The existing literature suggests vitamin D plays multiple roles in the musculoskeletal system. Recent research has shed light on the importance of vitamin D in the setting of soft tissue healing and recovery in addition to affecting postoperative outcomes after common orthopaedic procedures. 

Conclusions: Given the widespread prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the current evidence regarding clinical implications in patients with musculoskeletal complaints.
