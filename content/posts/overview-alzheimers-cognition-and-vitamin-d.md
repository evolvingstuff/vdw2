#### A summary of the key points of this page by Claude2  - July 2023

The PDF provides an overview of the evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to increased risk of  **Alzheimer's**  disease and cognitive decline. It highlights numerous studies, facts, and observations supporting vitamin D's role in brain health.

 **Some key facts presented:** 

* Cognitive decline is 19 times more likely with low vitamin D levels.

* Dementia and  **Alzheimer's**  diseases are consistently associated with low vitamin D in many observational studies. 

   *  **Alzheimer's**  is 2.3 times more likely in the elderly with low D.

* Every single risk factor for  **Alzheimer's**  disease is also a risk factor for low vitamin D.

* As vitamin D levels in the elderly continue to decline, cognition gets worse.

* Increasing vitamin D has been observed to improve cognition in some reports.

*  **Alzheimer's**  patients are 3 times more likely to have a malfunctioning vitamin D receptor gene which can prevent vitamin D from getting into cells.

 **Some key observations:** 

* In animal studies, vitamin D has been found to help remove amyloid brain plaque associated with  **Alzheimer's** .

* Exposure to DDT, which decreases vitamin D, increases  **Alzheimer's**  risk by up to 3.8 times.

* Genes linked to  **Alzheimer's**  all also restrict vitamin D function.

* There are at least 11 ways vitamin D may help reduce  **Alzheimer's**  disease risk and pathology.

* Daily vitamin D supplementation around 4,000 IU improved cognition in  **Alzheimer's**  patients in a clinical trial.

In summary, the PDF compilation of references indicates substantial evidence for a link between low vitamin D and increased  **Alzheimer's**  and cognitive decline. It advocates vitamin D supplementation as a low-risk, low-cost prevention and treatment strategy. Combining vitamin D with omega-3 is highlighted as another promising approach currently being tested.

#### Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: Compared and Contrasted: [Perplexity AI April 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-compare-and-contrast-de-cL26Tn.vQSSoASn0GDsr_Q)

Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are terms often used interchangeably in everyday conversation, leading to confusion about what each represents. While closely related, they describe different concepts in neurological health. Understanding the distinction between these terms is crucial not only for medical professionals but also for patients and caregivers navigating diagnosis, treatment, and care planning.

  1. Definitions and Relationship

    1. What is Dementia?

Dementia is not a specific disease but rather an umbrella term that describes a collection of symptoms affecting cognitive abilities, memory, and behavior. These symptoms are severe enough to interfere with daily functioning and independence. Dementia represents a syndrome—a group of related symptoms—rather than a specific diagnosis <sup>[1]</sup> <sup>[5]</sup> <sup>[9]</sup>.

The symptoms of dementia typically include memory loss, confusion, difficulties with problem-solving, language impairment, and changes in behavior <sup>[7]</sup> <sup>[9]</sup>. These symptoms result from damage to brain cells, interfering with their ability to communicate with each other properly <sup>[1]</sup>.

    1. What is Alzheimer's Disease?

Unlike dementia, Alzheimer's disease is a specific degenerative brain disease. It's a defined medical condition with particular biological processes and pathological features <sup>[5]</sup> <sup>[8]</sup>. Alzheimer's disease begins with the buildup of abnormal proteins in the brain in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which causes brain cells to die and the brain to shrink over time <sup>[4]</sup> <sup>[12]</sup>.

    1. The Relationship Between Them

The most important distinction is that Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for approximately 60-80% of all dementia cases <sup>[1]</sup> <sup>[7]</sup> <sup>[8]</sup>. In other words, Alzheimer's disease is a specific illness that often leads to dementia symptoms, while dementia is the set of symptoms that can result from Alzheimer's or other conditions affecting the brain <sup>[5]</sup>.

As one source succinctly puts it: "The main difference between Alzheimer's and dementia is that Alzheimer's is a disease in the brain, whereas dementia is a collection of symptoms" <sup>[5]</sup>.

  1. Causes and Pathology

    1. Causes of Dementia

Dementia can result from various diseases and conditions that damage brain cells, including:

- Alzheimer's disease (most common cause)

- Vascular disease (affecting blood flow to the brain)

- Lewy body disease 

- Frontotemporal degeneration

- Traumatic brain injury

- Certain infections

- Nutritional deficiencies

- Chronic alcohol abuse <sup>[6]</sup> <sup>[7]</sup> <sup>[9]</sup> <sup>[10]</sup>

Multiple pathological processes underlie different types of dementia, though common mechanisms include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions to the blood-brain barrier <sup>[11]</sup>.

    1. Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease has a specific pathological signature characterized by:

- Accumulation of amyloid-β protein plaques outside neurons

- Formation of neurofibrillary tangles (composed of tau protein) inside neurons

- Progressive neuronal death and brain atrophy

- Initial damage to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (memory centers)

- Gradual spread to temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes <sup>[4]</sup> <sup>[10]</sup> <sup>[12]</sup>

These changes begin years—sometimes decades—before symptoms become apparent, 

with the disease following a relatively predictable progression pattern through the brain <sup>[12]</sup>.

  1. Clinical Features and Symptoms

    1. Dementia Symptoms

The general symptoms of dementia include:

- Memory loss

- Confusion and difficulties with daily tasks

- Problems with language and understanding

- Difficulty with reasoning and judgment

- Changes in behavior and personality

- Disorientation to time and place

- Problems with visual perception <sup>[1]</sup> <sup>[2]</sup> <sup>[9]</sup>

    1. Alzheimer's Disease Symptoms

While Alzheimer's shares the general symptoms of dementia, it has a characteristic pattern:

- Early and prominent episodic memory impairment (particularly for recently learned information)

- Difficulty encoding new memories (rather than just retrieving them)

- Word-finding difficulties and language problems

- Progressive disorientation and confusion

- Later development of behavioral changes

- In advanced stages: difficulty with basic functions like walking, swallowing, and speaking <sup>[1]</sup> <sup>[3]</sup> <sup>[12]</sup>

A key feature of Alzheimer's is the nature of the memory impairment: "The episodic memory impairment of AD is presumed to be due to a diminished ability to encode new material into long-term memory. This produces a rapid decay of memory traces, affecting both recall and recognition of verbal and visual material" <sup>[12]</sup>.

    1. Differences Across Dementia Types

Different types of dementia have distinctive symptom patterns that help with differential diagnosis:

- In Lewy body dementia: Visual hallucinations, movement issues similar to Parkinson's disease, and sleep disturbances are prominent, with the memory deficit being "one of retrieval rather than encoding" <sup>[6]</sup> <sup>[12]</sup>

- In vascular dementia: Problems with planning, organizing, and decision-making may appear before significant memory issues <sup>[9]</sup>

- In frontotemporal dementia: Personality and behavioral changes or language impairment typically precede memory problems <sup>[10]</sup> <sup>[12]</sup>

  1. Progression and Stages

    1. Dementia Progression

All forms of dementia are progressive, meaning symptoms worsen over time, though the rate and pattern vary depending on the underlying cause <sup>[9]</sup>.

    1. Alzheimer's Disease Progression

Alzheimer's typically follows a more predictable course divided into three main stages:

1. **Early-stage (mild)**: Memory lapses, word-finding difficulties, trouble with new information, misplacing objects, and challenges with planning <sup>[3]</sup>

2. **Middle-stage (moderate)**: Increasing confusion, difficulty recognizing friends and family, and significant behavioral changes

3. **Late-stage (severe)**: Inability to communicate or perform basic self-care, requiring around-the-clock assistance, loss of awareness of surroundings, and physical decline including difficulty with walking, sitting, and swallowing <sup>[3]</sup>

Before the dementia phase, some individuals experience Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which can be "an early stage of the disease continuum for Alzheimer's if the hallmark changes in the brain are present. However, not all people with MCI develop dementia" <sup>[3]</sup>.

  1. Diagnosis Approaches

Diagnosing the specific type of dementia is increasingly important for proper treatment planning. Current approaches include:

- Clinical evaluation of symptoms and medical history

- Cognitive and neuropsychological testing

- Brain imaging (MRI, CT, PET scans)

- In the case of Alzheimer's, biomarkers have become more important in diagnosis <sup>[12]</sup>

The 2011 criteria for Alzheimer's disease represent a significant advance, recognizing 

"a broad AD spectrum (from preclinical to mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia) 

and requirement of AD biomarkers for diagnosis" <sup>[12]</sup>.

  1. Treatment Options

    1. Managing Dementia

While there is no cure for dementia, management approaches include:

- Physical activity and participation in cognitively stimulating activities

- Support services for patients and caregivers

- Medications to address specific symptoms

- Treatment of underlying conditions when possible <sup>[7]</sup>

    1. Alzheimer's Disease Treatment

Alzheimer's treatment typically includes:

- Cholinesterase inhibitors (like donepezil) for symptom management

- NMDA receptor antagonists (like memantine) for moderate to severe cases

- Management of behavioral symptoms

- Supportive care services <sup>[4]</sup> <sup>[7]</sup>

As one source notes: "There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease... 

But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. 

Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers" <sup>[4]</sup>.

  1. Prevalence and Impact

The scope of dementia and Alzheimer's disease represents a significant global health challenge:

- Approximately 57 million people worldwide had dementia in 2021, with nearly 10 million new cases annually <sup>[7]</sup>

- 60-70% of dementia cases are attributed to Alzheimer's disease <sup>[7]</sup>

- Dementia is the seventh leading cause of death globally <sup>[7]</sup>

- The economic impact of dementia was estimated at US$1.3 trillion in 2019 <sup>[7]</sup>

- Women are disproportionately affected, both as patients and as caregivers <sup>[7]</sup>

- In the United States, about 6.9 million people age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease, with more than 70% being 75 and older <sup>[4]</sup>

  1. Conclusion

While Alzheimer's disease and dementia are related concepts, they are not identical. Dementia represents a syndrome characterized by a collection of cognitive and behavioral symptoms that can be caused by various conditions, while Alzheimer's disease is the most common specific brain disease that leads to dementia. Alzheimer's has distinctive pathological features, primarily the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which progressively damage the brain.

Understanding this relationship is critical for several reasons: it guides appropriate diagnosis, informs treatment planning, helps patients and families prepare for different disease trajectories, and supports ongoing research into prevention and treatment of these devastating conditions. As potential disease-modifying treatments emerge, the ability to distinguish Alzheimer's from other causes of dementia becomes increasingly important for determining who might benefit from specific interventions.

#### Alzheimer's patients had lower levels of vitamin D in Cerebrospinal Fluid - Feb 2022

 **Vitamin D in Alzheimer's Disease: Low Levels in Cerebrospinal Fluid Despite Normal Amounts in Serum** 

J Alzheimers Dis. 2022 Feb 15. [doi: 10.3233/JAD-215536](https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-215536)

Jelena Zugic Soares 1 2 3, Jørgen Valeur 3, Jūratė Šaltytė Benth 4 5, Anne-Brita Knapskog 6, Geir Selbæk 2 6 7, Golchin Arefi 8, D Gregor Gilfillan 8, Anita Tollisen 3, Nenad Bogdanovic 6 9, Renate Pettersen 1

Background: Vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested as a dementia risk factor.

Objective: In this cross-sectional, explorative study we investigated whether levels of vitamin D in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are lower in patients with positive biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to cognitively healthy controls and whether polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene, FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI, are associated with levels of vitamin D in CSF and cognition.

Methods: We included 100 patients≥65 years assessed for cognitive impairment and 76 cognitively healthy controls. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in both serum and CSF, and VDR polymorphisms were analyzed.

Results: The mean level of 25(OH)D in serum was 78.6 (SD 28.9) nmol/l. While serum levels of 25(OH)D were not significantly different between the groups, CSF levels of 25(OH)D were significantly lower in patients with positive AD core biomarkers (p = 0.001) compared to patients without such biomarkers. Individuals with the BsmI major homozygote genotype had significantly lower results on a 10-word delayed recall test (p = 0.044) and verbal fluency test (p = 0.013), and individuals with the TaqI major homozygote genotype had significantly lower results on a verbal fluency test (p = 0.030) compared to individuals with the corresponding minor homozygote genotype.

Conclusion: Patients with positive AD core biomarkers have low CSF levels of 25(OH)D, despite sufficient serum levels. CSF levels of 25(OH)D do not seem to be affected by any of the four VDR gene polymorphisms. TaqI and BsmI major homozygote genotypes might be at increased risk for development of cognitive decline.

Fig. 2. Proposed mechanisms of vitamin D-mediated multitargeted effects in AD. Vitamin D imbalance is proposed to alter mechanisms implicated in aging and AD pathogenesis. Suggested protective effects of vitamin D supplementation concern regulation of vascular processes and oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, neurotransmission, modulation of immune and inflammatory processes, and direct impact on amyloidogenesis, ultimately improving cognitive functions.

#### APOE4 gene greatly increases the risk of AD, but had been a benefit during childhood

The APOe4 gene protected our ancestors and helped them get through the childbearing years by attacking parasites and micro-organisms with oxidative stress.  It is only in modern times that people live long enough for the same oxidative stress to work against us in old age. 

A book,  **Survival of the Sickest** ,(2008)  points out roughly the same concept in a number of other diseases which long ago helped our ancestors get through plagues, ice ages, parasites, famine, etc. It's a fascinating concept and it makes sense.   By Rich H, Jan 2017
