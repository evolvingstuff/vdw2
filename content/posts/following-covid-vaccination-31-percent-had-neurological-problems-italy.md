#### NEURO-COVAX: Italian Network Finds Neurological Side Effects Very Common after COVID-19 Vaccination

 **[McCullough substack](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/neuro-covax-italian-network-finds?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1119676&post_id=138365443&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=ofo3r&utm_medium=email)** 

 **31.2% Experienced Tremors, Insomnia, Muscle Spasms, Headaches, Paresthesias, Vertigo, and Diplopia** 

The [NEURO-COVAX](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37897023/)-cohort included 19,108 vaccinated people: 

* 15,368 with BNT162b2 (Pfizer), 

* 2,077 with mRNA-1273, 

* 1,651 with ChAdOx1nCov-19

“A vulnerable clinical profile emerged, where over 40% of the symptomatic people showed comorbidities in their clinical histories. Defining the neurological risk profile, we found an increased risk for ChAdOx1nCov-19 of tremors (vs. BNT162b2, OR:  **5.12** , 95% CI: 3.51-7.48); insomnia (vs. mRNA-1273, OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.02-3.39); muscle spasms (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.08-2.46); and headaches (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-1.57). For mRNA-1273, there were increased risks of paresthesia (numbness and tingling) (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.48-3.79); vertigo (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.20-2.35); diplopia (double vision) (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 0.67-3.57); and sleepiness (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98-1.67). In the period that ranged from March to August 2021, no one was hospitalized and/or died of severe complications related to the primary series of two COVID-19 vaccines. Hospitalization or death after one shot was not captured.”

*1,651 with ChAdOx1nCov-19
“A vulnerable clinical profile emerged, where over 40% of the symptomatic people showed comorbidities in their clinical histories. Defining the neurological risk profile, we found an increased risk for ChAdOx1nCov-19 of tremors (vs. BNT162b2, OR: __5.12__, 95% CI: 3.51-7.48); insomnia (vs. mRNA-1273, OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.02-3.39); muscle spasms (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.08-2.46); and headaches (vs. BNT162b2, OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-1.57). For mRNA-1273, there were increased risks of paresthesia (numbness and tingling) (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.48-3.79); vertigo (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.20-2.35); diplopia (double vision) (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 0.67-3.57); and sleepiness (vs. ChAdOx1nCov-19, OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.98-1.67). In the period that ranged from March to August 2021, no one was hospitalized and/or died of severe complications related to the primary series of two COVID-19 vaccines. Hospitalization or death after one shot was not captured.”
