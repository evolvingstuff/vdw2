 **[GreenMedInfo](https://greenmedinfo.com/blog/13-million-reports-injuries-after-covid-vaccines-vaers-data-show-cdc-meets-rubber?)** 

* "VAERS data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 1,301,356 reports of adverse events from all age groups following COVID-19 vaccines, including 28,859 deaths and 238,412 serious injuries between Dec. 14, 2020, and June 10, 2022"

* In a CHD.TV live blog, Dr. Liz Mumper, a pediatrician and Children's Health Defense board member, said Pfizer showed an estimate of 80.3% vaccine efficacy but based it on only **7 cases in the placebo group and 3 in the vaccine group.** 

* "Mumper also pointed out the shots being considered at today's meeting were based on the  **original Wuhan strain that is no longer circulating.** "
