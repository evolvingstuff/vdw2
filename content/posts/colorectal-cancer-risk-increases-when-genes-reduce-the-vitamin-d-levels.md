#### Vitamin D-Related Genes, Blood Vitamin D Levels and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Western European Populations.

Nutrients. 2019 Aug 20;11(8). pii: E1954. [doi: 10.3390/nu11081954.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11081954.)

 **The study seems to ignore the many genes which also affect the amount of vitamin D actually getting to tissues, but which do not change the levels of vitamin D in the blood.**
