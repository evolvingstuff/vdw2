#### There Is No Science That Shows Vaccines Cause Autism...Except In These Published Studies Which Show Vaccines Cause Autism

 **[2nd Smartest Guy in the World](https://www.2ndsmartestguyintheworld.com/p/there-is-no-science-that-shows-vaccines?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=400535&post_id=156615863&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=ofo3r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)  substack**

1. Hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and autism diagnosis, NHIS 1997-2002

1. Do  **aluminum**  vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism?

1. What is regressive autism and why does it occur?

1. A comprehensive review of  **mercury**  provoked autism

1.  **thimerosal**  Exposure and the Role of Sulfation Chemistry and Thiol Availability in Autism

1. A prospective study of  **thimerosal** -containing Rho(D)-immune globulin administration as a risk factor for autistic disorders

1. Hypothesis: conjugate vaccines may predispose children to autism spectrum disorders

1. The potential importance of steroids in the treatment of autistic spectrum disorders and other disorders involving  **mercury**  toxicity

1. Reduced levels of  **mercury**  in first baby haircuts of autistic children

1. Cultured lymphocytes from autistic children and non-autistic siblings up-regulate heat shock protein RNA in response to  **thimerosal**  challenge

1. Elevated levels of  **measles**  antibodies in children with autism

1. Subtle DNA changes and the overuse of vaccines in autism

1. What is regressive autism and why does it occur? 

> Is it the consequence of multi-systemic dysfunction affecting the elimination of heavy metals and the ability to regulate neural temperature?
