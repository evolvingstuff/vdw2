#### Metabolomics analysis reveals molecular linkages for the impact of vitamin D on childhood allergic airway diseases

Pediatr Allergy Immunol 2022 May;33(5):e13785. [doi: 10.1111/pai.13785.PDF](https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13785.PDF) is behind paywall

Background: Several studies have reported the relevance between serum vitamin D and allergic immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses and atopic diseases. However, a metabolomics-based approach to the impacts of vitamin D on allergic reactions remains unclear.

Methods: A total of 111 children completed a 3-year follow-up were enrolled and classified based on longitudinal vitamin D status (â‰¥ 30 ng/ml, n = 54; 20-29.9 ng/ml, n = 41; <20 ng/ml, n = 16). Urinary metabolomic profiling was performed using 1 H-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at age 3. Integrative analyses of their associations related to vitamin D levels, atopic indices, and allergies were performed, and their roles in functional metabolic pathways were also assessed.

Results: Six and five metabolites were identified to be significantly associated with vitamin D status and atopic diseases, respectively (FDR-adjusted p-value <.05). A further correlation analysis revealed that vitamin D-associated 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid and glutamine were positively correlated with atopic disease-associated succinic acid and alanine, respectively. Furthermore, hippuric acid was negatively correlated with atopic disease-associated formic acid, which was positively correlated with vitamin D level (p < .01). Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) was positively correlated with serum D. pteronyssinus- and D. farinae-specific IgE level (p < .01) but negatively correlated with vitamin D level (p < .05). Amino acid metabolisms were significantly associated with vitamin D related to childhood allergies.

Conclusion: Integrative metabolomic analysis provides the link of vitamin D-associated metabolites with the gut microbiome and immunoallergic reactions related to childhood allergies.
