Background Dietary vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes in animals. Our aim was to ascertain whether or not vitamin D supplementation or deficiency in infancy could affect development of type 1 diabetes.

Methods A birth-cohort study was done, in which all pregnant women (n=12 055) in Oulu and Lapland, northern Finland, who were due to give birth in 1966 were enrolled. Data was collected in the first year of life about frequency and dose of vitamin D supplementation and presence of suspected rickets. Our primary outcome measure was diagnosis of type 1 diabetes by end of December, 1997.

Findings 12 058 of 12 231 represented live births, and 10 821 (91% of those alive) children were followed-up at age 1 year. Of the 10 366 children included in analyses, 81 were diagnosed with diabetes during the study. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decreased frequency of type 1 diabetes when adjusted for neonatal, anthropometric, and social characteristics (rate ratio &lt;span&gt;[RR]&lt;/span&gt; for regular vs no supplementation 0-12, 95% CI 0-03-0-51, and irregular vs no supplementation 0-16, 0-04-0-74. Children who regularly took the recommended dose of vitamin D (2000 IU daily) had a RR of 0-22 (0-05-0-89) compared with those who regularly received less than the recommended amount. Children suspected of having rickets during the first year of life had a RR of 3-0 (1-0-9-0) compared with those without such a suspicion.

Interpretation Dietary vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes. Ensuring adequate vitamin D supplementation for infants could help to reverse the increasing trend in the incidence of type 1 diabetes.

#### Does more vitamin D as infant result in fewer autoimmune diseases as adult? Asked[Perplexity AI - Oct 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/dose-more-vitamin-d-as-infant-X45BACiYRqmkLnjgYsJrnA)

Based on the available research, there is evidence suggesting that higher vitamin D levels in infancy and early childhood may be associated with a reduced risk of developing certain autoimmune diseases later in life:

 **Potential Protective Effects** 

Several studies have found links between early-life vitamin D status and autoimmune disease risk:

* Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. One study found that children who regularly ingested 2,000 IU of vitamin D during the first year of life were 80% less likely to develop type 1 diabetes mellitus [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2009130)

* Vitamin D deficiency as an infant has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis later in life. Studies have found that higher vitamin D levels before age 20 were associated with a lower risk of MS diagnosis &amp;nbsp; [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2009130)

* In animal models, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to prevent or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases  &amp;nbsp; [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098920/)

 **Mechanisms of Action** 

Vitamin D appears to play important roles in regulating the immune system:

* It enhances innate immune responses against pathogens  &amp;nbsp; [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282029/)

* It suppresses inflammatory immune responses involved in autoimmunity  &amp;nbsp;[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282029/)

* Vitamin D signaling affects genes involved in inflammation and both innate and adaptive immunity  &amp;nbsp; [3](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj-2021-066452)

 **Clinical Evidence** 

While observational studies suggest a link, high-quality interventional evidence in humans is still limited:

* A large randomized controlled trial found that vitamin D supplementation in adults for 5 years reduced autoimmune disease incidence by 22%  &amp;nbsp; [3](https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj-2021-066452)

* However, prospective studies specifically examining infant vitamin D levels and adult autoimmune disease risk are lacking  &amp;nbsp; [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098920/)

 **Conclusion** 

While the evidence is promising, more research is needed to definitively establish if higher vitamin D levels in infancy directly lead to fewer autoimmune diseases in adulthood. Nonetheless, ensuring adequate vitamin D status in early life appears prudent given its many potential health benefits. Consulting a pediatrician about appropriate supplementation is recommended.

#### Skewed epithelial cell differentiation and premature aging of the thymus in the absence of vitamin D signaling

Science Advances - Sep 2024 Vol 10, Issue 39 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adm9582

Central tolerance of thymocytes to self-antigen depends on the medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) transcription factor autoimmune regulator (Aire), which drives tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) gene expression. Vitamin D signaling regulates Aire and TRA expression in mTECs, providing a basis for links between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmunity. We find that mice lacking Cyp27b1, which cannot produce hormonally active vitamin D, display profoundly reduced thymic cellularity, with a reduced proportion of Aire+ mTECs, attenuated TRA expression, and poorly defined cortical-medullary boundaries. Markers of T cell negative selection are diminished, and organ-specific autoantibodies are present in knockout (KO) mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that loss of Cyp27b1 skews mTEC differentiation toward Ccl21+ intertypical TECs and generates a gene expression profile consistent with premature aging. KO thymi display accelerated involution and reduced expression of thymic longevity factors. Thus, loss of thymic vitamin D signaling disrupts normal mTEC differentiation and function and accelerates thymic aging.

##### [Press release for the study](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-10-vitamin-d-deficiency-autoimmune-diseases.html): How vitamin D deficiency can lead to autoimmune diseases

by Keila DePape, McGill University

As Canadians brace for &quot;vitamin D winter&quot;—months when the sun&#39;s angle is too low to produce the vitamin in the skin—a McGill University study explains why vitamin D deficiency early in life is associated with a higher risk of autoimmune diseases.

During childhood, the thymus helps train immune cells to distinguish between the body&#39;s own tissues and harmful invaders. A vitamin D deficiency at that stage of life causes the thymus to age more quickly, the researchers discovered.

The study is published in the journal Science Advances.

&quot; **An aging thymus leads to a &#39;leaky&#39; immune system,&quot;**  said lead author John White, a Professor in and Chair of McGill&#39;s Department of Physiology. &quot;This means the thymus becomes less effective at filtering out immune cells that could mistakenly attack healthy tissues, increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes.&quot;

He noted that researchers have known for years that vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium for strong bones, and that more recent research has discovered its crucial role in regulating the immune system.

&quot;Our findings bring new clarity to this connection and could lead to new strategies for preventing autoimmune diseases,&quot; he said.

Although the research was conducted with mice, the findings are relevant to human health because the thymus functions similarly in both species, White added.

The importance of a sunlight substitute

The findings highlight the importance of adequate vitamin D intake, especially for children.

&quot;In places like Montreal, where we stop making the vitamin from sunlight between late fall and early spring, supplementation is key,&quot; said White. &quot;If you have a young child, it&#39;s important to consult with your health-care provider to ensure they&#39;re getting enough.&quot;

The breakthrough builds on a 2001 Finnish study, which  **followed more than 10,000 children** . It found that children who were supplemented early in life with vitamin D had up to a five-fold-lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life.

Finland, with its long periods of vitamin D winter, served as an ideal case study to learn more about the nutrient&#39;s many roles, said White.

In the McGill study, researchers used mice that couldn&#39;t produce vitamin D to examine how the deficiency affected the thymus, employing cell analysis and gene sequencing to see how it impacts the immune system.

In future studies, White hopes to explore how vitamin D affects the human thymus, something he notes has not been done before.

Vitamin D signaling regulates Aire and TRA expression in mTECs, providing a basis for links between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmunity.

Markers of T cell negative selection are diminished, and organ-specific autoantibodies are present in knockout (KO) mice.

Background Dietary vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes in animals. Our aim was to ascertain whether or not vitamin D supplementation or deficiency in infancy could affect development of type 1 diabetes.

Methods A birth-cohort study was done, in which all pregnant women (n=12 055) in Oulu and Lapland, northern Finland, who were due to give birth in 1966 were enrolled. Data was collected in the first year of life about frequency and dose of vitamin D supplementation and presence of suspected rickets. Our primary outcome measure was diagnosis of type 1 diabetes by end of December, 1997.
Findings 12 058 of 12 231 represented live births, and 10 821 (91% of those alive) children were followed-up at age 1 year. Of the 10 366 children included in analyses, 81 were diagnosed with diabetes during the study. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a decreased frequency of type 1 diabetes when adjusted for neonatal, anthropometric, and social characteristics (rate ratio [RR] for regular vs no supplementation 0-12, 95% CI 0-03-0-51, and irregular vs no supplementation 0-16, 0-04-0-74. Children who regularly took the recommended dose of vitamin D (2000 IU daily) had a RR of 0-22 (0-05-0-89) compared with those who regularly received less than the recommended amount. Children suspected of having rickets during the first year of life had a RR of 3-0 (1-0-9-0) compared with those without such a suspicion.

Interpretation Dietary vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes. Ensuring adequate vitamin D supplementation for infants could help to reverse the increasing trend in the incidence of type 1 diabetes.

!!!!Does more vitamin D as infant result in fewer autoimmune diseases as adult? Asked[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/dose-more-vitamin-d-as-infant-X45BACiYRqmkLnjgYsJrnA| Perplexity AI - Oct 2024]
Based on the available research, there is evidence suggesting that higher vitamin D levels in infancy and early childhood may be associated with a reduced risk of developing certain autoimmune diseases later in life:
__Potential Protective Effects__
Several studies have found links between early-life vitamin D status and autoimmune disease risk:
*Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. One study found that children who regularly ingested 2,000 IU of vitamin D during the first year of life were 80% less likely to develop type 1 diabetes mellitus [https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2009130|1]
*Vitamin D deficiency as an infant has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis later in life. Studies have found that higher vitamin D levels before age 20 were associated with a lower risk of MS diagnosis ~hs~ [https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2009130|1]
*In animal models, vitamin D supplementation has been shown to prevent or delay the onset of autoimmune diseases  ~hs~ [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098920/|4]
__Mechanisms of Action__
Vitamin D appears to play important roles in regulating the immune system:
*It enhances innate immune responses against pathogens  ~hs~ [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282029/|2]
*It suppresses inflammatory immune responses involved in autoimmunity  ~hs~[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282029/|2]
*Vitamin D signaling affects genes involved in inflammation and both innate and adaptive immunity  ~hs~ [https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj-2021-066452|3]
__Clinical Evidence__
While observational studies suggest a link, high-quality interventional evidence in humans is still limited:
*A large randomized controlled trial found that vitamin D supplementation in adults for 5 years reduced autoimmune disease incidence by 22%  ~hs~ [https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj-2021-066452|3]
*However, prospective studies specifically examining infant vitamin D levels and adult autoimmune disease risk are lacking  ~hs~ [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3098920/|4]
__Conclusion__
While the evidence is promising, more research is needed to definitively establish if higher vitamin D levels in infancy directly lead to fewer autoimmune diseases in adulthood. Nonetheless, ensuring adequate vitamin D status in early life appears prudent given its many potential health benefits. Consulting a pediatrician about appropriate supplementation is recommended.

!!!!Skewed epithelial cell differentiation and premature aging of the thymus in the absence of vitamin D signaling
Science Advances - Sep 2024 Vol 10, Issue 39 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adm9582

Central tolerance of thymocytes to self-antigen depends on the medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) transcription factor autoimmune regulator (Aire), which drives tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) gene expression. Vitamin D signaling regulates Aire and TRA expression in mTECs, providing a basis for links between vitamin D deficiency and autoimmunity. We find that mice lacking Cyp27b1, which cannot produce hormonally active vitamin D, display profoundly reduced thymic cellularity, with a reduced proportion of Aire+ mTECs, attenuated TRA expression, and poorly defined cortical-medullary boundaries. Markers of T cell negative selection are diminished, and organ-specific autoantibodies are present in knockout (KO) mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that loss of Cyp27b1 skews mTEC differentiation toward Ccl21+ intertypical TECs and generates a gene expression profile consistent with premature aging. KO thymi display accelerated involution and reduced expression of thymic longevity factors. Thus, loss of thymic vitamin D signaling disrupts normal mTEC differentiation and function and accelerates thymic aging.

!!!!![https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-10-vitamin-d-deficiency-autoimmune-diseases.html|Press release for the study]: How vitamin D deficiency can lead to autoimmune diseases

As Canadians brace for &quot;vitamin D winter&quot;—months when the sun&#39;s angle is too low to produce the vitamin in the skin—a McGill University study explains why vitamin D deficiency early in life is associated with a higher risk of autoimmune diseases.

During childhood, the thymus helps train immune cells to distinguish between the body&#39;s own tissues and harmful invaders. A vitamin D deficiency at that stage of life causes the thymus to age more quickly, the researchers discovered.

The study is published in the journal Science Advances.

&quot;__An aging thymus leads to a &#39;leaky&#39; immune system,&quot;__ said lead author John White, a Professor in and Chair of McGill&#39;s Department of Physiology. &quot;This means the thymus becomes less effective at filtering out immune cells that could mistakenly attack healthy tissues, increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes.&quot;

He noted that researchers have known for years that vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium for strong bones, and that more recent research has discovered its crucial role in regulating the immune system.

&quot;Our findings bring new clarity to this connection and could lead to new strategies for preventing autoimmune diseases,&quot; he said.

Although the research was conducted with mice, the findings are relevant to human health because the thymus functions similarly in both species, White added.

The importance of a sunlight substitute
The findings highlight the importance of adequate vitamin D intake, especially for children.

&quot;In places like Montreal, where we stop making the vitamin from sunlight between late fall and early spring, supplementation is key,&quot; said White. &quot;If you have a young child, it&#39;s important to consult with your health-care provider to ensure they&#39;re getting enough.&quot;

The breakthrough builds on a 2001 Finnish study, which __followed more than 10,000 children__. It found that children who were supplemented early in life with vitamin D had up to a five-fold-lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life.

Finland, with its long periods of vitamin D winter, served as an ideal case study to learn more about the nutrient&#39;s many roles, said White.

In the McGill study, researchers used mice that couldn&#39;t produce vitamin D to examine how the deficiency affected the thymus, employing cell analysis and gene sequencing to see how it impacts the immune system.

In future studies, White hopes to explore how vitamin D affects the human thymus, something he notes has not been done before.
