#### [The socioeconomic revolving door of 30-day heart failure readmissions](https://www.mdedge.com/cardiology/article/229735/heart-failure/socioeconomic-revolving-door-30-day-heart-failure?)

* “In a retrospective cohort study, Blacks had a 45% higher risk of 30-day readmission than Whites (P < .001) independent of cardiovascular risk factors, clinical history, comorbidities, type and location of hospital, and type of third-party payer coverage. The analysis included more than 30,000 patients with at least one HF hospitalization at centers in a major metropolitan health system.”
