#### Summary of this page by CHAT-GPT-4  Sept 2023

 **Facts:** 

* Many studies have shown associations between autism and low Vitamin D levels.

* Clinical trials have shown that Vitamin D during pregnancy can prevent Autism.

* Clinical trials have also treated autism in children with Vitamin D.

* The recommendation is to take extra vitamin D when pregnant. While there's a small risk in taking vitamin D during pregnancy, the risk of not doing so is significant, especially if you already have an autistic child.

 **Highlighted Studies and Information:** 

* Autism was 20X more likely if acetaminophen (Tylenol) was used from age 12 - 18 months (July 2023).

* There were over 200 studies suggesting a link between vaccines and autism as of 2023.

* The US saw an explosion of autism cases, with the cost associated with autism reaching $223 billion/year in 2020.

* Almost 7% of 8-year-old boys in California had autism in 2020, with males being 3.8X more likely to have autism than females.

* Autism symptoms, in some cases, disappeared by changing the diet.

* A 3X increase in autism in boys by age 3 was observed if they had 3 hours of daily screen time before age 1 (potentially due to less vitamin D exposure) as of Feb 2022.

* Autism may be synergistically treated by Vitamin D and probiotics (July 2022).

* Autism was 2X to 3X more likely if there was a poor Vitamin D Receptor (June 2020).

* Vaccinations resulted in increased office visits for children 16 months later (Nov 2020).

* Dr. Cannell, who is associated with the Vitamin D Council, has written and spoken extensively about the relationship between autism and Vitamin D. He suggests that autism can be treated with Vitamin D levels between 80 – 120 ng.

#### Autism decreased by Omega-3, increased by Omega-6

##### Autism treated by a combination of Vitamin D plus Omega-3 - case report 2020

 **Omega-3 PUFAs and vitamin D co-supplementation as a safe-effective therapeutic approach for core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder: case report and literature review** 

Nutritional Neuroscience. An International J. on Nutrition, Diet and Nervous System. Vol 23, 2020 - Issue 10 https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1557385

Marco Infante,Barry Sears,Angela Maria Rizzo,Daniela Mariani Cerati,Massimiliano Caprio,Camillo Ricordi 

Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by abnormal development of cognitive, social, and communicative skills. Although ASD aetiology and pathophysiology are still unclear, various nutritional factors have been investigated as potential risk factors for ASD development, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamin D deficiency. In fact, both omega-3 PUFAs and vitamin D are important for brain development and function.

Case report: Herein, we report the case of a 23-year-old young adult male with autism who was referred to our Unit due to a 12-month history of cyclic episodes of restlessness, agitation, irritability, and oppositional and self-injurious behaviors. Laboratory tests documented a markedly altered omega-6/omega-3 balance, along with a vitamin D deficiency, as assessed by serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation was therefore started, with remarkable improvements in ASD symptoms throughout a 24-month follow-up period. A brief review of the literature for interventional studies evaluating the efficacy of omega-3 or vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of ASD-related symptoms is also provided.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting remarkable beneficial effects on ASD symptoms deriving from omega-3 and vitamin D combination therapy. This case report suggests omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation as a potential safe-effective therapeutic strategy to treat core symptoms of ASD. However, larger studies are needed to evaluate the real efficacy of such therapeutic approach in a broader sample of ASD patients.

#### Autism Tsunami - US cost $223 billion/year in 2020

 **Autism Tsunami: the Impact of Rising Prevalence on the Societal Cost of Autism in the United States - May 2021** 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders May 2021 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-021-05120-7

Mark Blaxill • Toby Rogers • Cynthia Nevison

The cost of ASD in the U.S. is estimated using a forecast model that, for the first time, accounts for the true historical increase in ASD. Model inputs include ASD prevalence, census population projections, six cost categories, ten age brackets, inflation projections, and three future prevalence scenarios.

Future ASD costs increase dramatically: total base-case costs of

* $223 (175-271) billion/year are estimated in 2020;

* $589 billion/year in 2030,

* $1.36 trillion/year in 2040, and

* $5.54 (4.29-6.78) trillion/year by 2060,

 **with substantial potential savings through ASD prevention** . Rising prevalence, the shift from child to adult-dominated costs, the transfer of costs from parents onto the government, and the soaring total costs raise pressing policy questions and demand an urgent focus on prevention strategies.

 **[A modern day witch trial](https://tobyrogers.substack.com/p/a-modern-day-witch-trial?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) substack by Rogers in May 2023** 

* "The titans of the autism industry have officially banned any discussion of the prevalence, causes, and costs of autism in order to continue profiting from the mass poisoning of children."

* "A societal cost of autism model (or really any cost of disease model) is pretty straightforward. One just has to calculate the prevalence of the condition in the population and then estimate the costs across several categories — lost parental wages, lost personal wages (for the person with the condition), educational costs, healthcare costs, supportive services (particularly housing) costs — and then just multiply the number of people afflicted times the average cost per person to come up with a number for the whole society."

#### Perhaps many Females are autistic - but they have very different symptoms than males.

> "Some researchers theorize that girls are better than boys at camouflaging their symptoms, particularly during highly structured interactions such as clinic visits. For instance, a colleague of mine described girls with autism as “caricatures” in social interactions. These girls may be motivated to interact, but their behaviors seem exaggerated."

 **[Fever Benefits for Autism in a Food](https://nutritionfacts.org/2021/03/23/fever-benefits-for-autism-in-a-food/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&utm_campaign=43b4159ea2-RSS_BLOG_DAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-43b4159ea2-25209481&mc_cid=43b4159ea2&mc_eid=b95641625a) Video and Transcript -Dr. Greger March 2021** 

Nobel Prize for Medicine for brain ailments went to the “father of fever therapy,”

When the brain gets too hot, it generates heat shock proteins to protect itself

sulforaphane, the active ingredient in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, kale, and collard greens, activates the heat shock response.

His [2nd video on Autism and Food](https://nutritionfacts.org/2021/03/25/fighting-autism-brain-inflammation-with-food/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&utm_campaign=ecb78c5602-RSS_BLOG_DAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-ecb78c5602-25209481&mc_cid=ecb78c5602&mc_eid=b95641625a) points out that four different aspects of Autism are treated by sulforaphane

* shock proteins are released to boost synaptic transmission,

* Nrf2 is activated to wipe out the free radicals,

* mitochondrial function is restored,

* suppress the inflammation triggered by NF-kappa-beta
