### [Vitamin D against Overweight, Dr Michael Colgan](https://www.facebook.com/cortexhypnosis/posts/704025316277738%20) Facebook Sept 2013

When I write about different nutrients and lifestyle factors that regulate body fat, I get a few folk writing back saying that overeating or processed carbs, or couch surfing, are the main causes. Of course they are. If you follow Miss Piggy’s advice to, “Never eat anything bigger than your head”, you’re going to be fat as a porker.

But we have hundreds of folk through the Colgan Institute who are trying their best to lose fat, sticking to good nutrition and exercise that would lean most of us down to a rail.  **Yet the fat, especially belly fat, just hangs on** . In these articles, I give you the factors backed by the most robust science, that we use to get them over the hump. I like to keep articles short, down to 5 or 6 main studies, but this time, just for once, I will cite a bit more of the latest evidence than usual, just to let folk know that we know what we are doing. It’s certainly the case with vitamin D.

Both clinical and epidemiological studies show that obese individuals have low vitamin D status(2–7) and often vitamin D deficiency.(8,9). The lower the level of serum vitamin D, the higher the Body Mass Index (BMI), the higher the level of body fat, the higher the level of visceral fat, and the porkier the waist.(10-14) No doubt about it.

Low vitamin D status also leads to development of insulin resistance in both adults(15,16,17) and children(18,19). Even In healthy adults, low serum vitamin D levels predict higher BMI and higher body fat. (20)

Recent genomic science shows that white fat cells (the usual kind) are a direct target of vitamin D, which inhibits formation of new fat cells and regulates fat cell activity.(21, 22).

Increased dietary vitamin D intake, and increases in serum vitamin D, result in lower visceral fat (in women). (23). And a recent double-blind study, showed that dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D for 16 weeks resulted in considerable reductions of visceral fat in both overweight and obese adults(24).

In agreement with a number of vitamin D experts, our report on Vitamin D reviews a mass of recent studies showing that a large proportion of the populations of both the US and Canada are deficient in this essential nutrient.(1)

We review numerous studies indicating that the  **serum range of vitamin D needed to overcome this problem is 100-200 nmol/L.(1)**  The range of dietary vitamin D required to bring blood levels into this range in the US and Canada is 2,000-4,000 IU per day.(1)

Most folk living at southern latitudes (more sunlight), or who have white skins (make more vitamin D per hour of sun exposure), require the lower end of this range. Most folk who live at northern latitudes, or have dark skins, require the higher end of the range.(1)

The main dietary sources of vitamin D are sunlight on bare skin, and oily fish. Supplementation with OIL-FILLED VITAMIN D3 CAPSULES, (not tablets, or vitamin D in multi-vitamins) is also an effective way to raise serum vitamin D levels.

Low vitamin D status is an important factor in overweight. Many people who are trying unsuccessfully to lose fat may benefit greatly from getting their vitamin D levels checked, and, if low, correcting them. May the vitamin D force be with you.
