#### Risk of dying in seniors increased 2.2X if both low handgrip strength and low vitamin D - Feb 2024

 **Interaction between handgrip strength and vitamin D deficiency on all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older adults: a prospective cohort study** 

Public Health. 2024 Feb:227:1-8. [doi: 10.1016/j.puhe.2023.11.022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2023.11.022)

Objective: Muscle strength decline and vitamin D deficiency are coexisting conditions associated with multiple adverse health outcomes. This prospective study aimed to investigate the multiplicative and additive interactions between handgrip strength (HS) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> on all-cause mortality in Chinese community-dwelling older adults.

Study design: This is a population-based cohort study.

Methods: 2635 older adults (85.15 Â± 12.01 years) were recruited from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (2012-2018). Low HS was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 updated consensus (<28 kg for men and <18 kg for women). Serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L were defined as vitamin D deficiency. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association of HS and 25(OH)D with all-cause mortality. Socio-demographics, health status, and clinical characteristics were included as covariates.

Results: 1715 (65.09 %) and 1885 (71.54 %) participants had low HS and vitamin D deficiency, respectively. During a median follow-up of 3.52 years, 1107 older people died. After multivariable adjustment, both HS and 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with all-cause mortality risk (Ps < 0.001). The hazard ratios (HRs) of low HS and vitamin D deficiency for all-cause mortality were 1.73 (95 % CI: 1.41-2.13) and 1.61 (95 % CI: 1.32-1.93), respectively. Although significant multiplicative interactions were not found, the association between low HS and all-cause mortality was attenuated in the higher 25(OH)D subgroup than in the lower 25(OH)D subgroup (stratified by 50 nmol/L). 

The multiple-adjusted HR of mortality for combined low HS and vitamin D deficiency was 2.18 (95 % CI: 1.73-2.56), which was higher than that for these two conditions alone. Significant additive interactions between low HS and vitamin D deficiency on mortality were observed (relative excess risk due to interaction: 0.71, 95 % CI: 0.37-1.05).

Conclusions: Low HS and low 25(OH)D levels synergistically increased the risk of all-cause mortality. Our results added new insights to the priority of early detection for older adults with comorbid muscle strength decline and vitamin D deficiency.

#### Vitamin D Supplementation Improves Handgrip Strength in Postmenopausal Women - Meta-analysis May 2022

 **Vitamin D Supplementation Improves Handgrip Strength in Postmenopausal Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials** 

Front. Endocrinol., 31 May 2022  Vol 13 - 2022 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.863448 &nbsp; **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/handgrip-meta-compresspdf.pdf">PDF</a>** 

Introduction: In postmenopausal women, vitamin D deficiency (as defined by the circulating level of 25(OH)D being below 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L)) is a regular occurrence. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the muscle function of postmenopausal women has been controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examines and summarizes the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the muscular strength and mobility of postmenopausal women.

Methods: RCTs that met the inclusion criteria for this study were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Postmenopausal women who were included in the study were exposed to RCTs assessing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplements. Meta-analysis data were extracted by two independent reviewers and screened for methodological quality. RCTs that did not meet the minimum requirement for assessment were excluded. 

In the meta-analysis, the effect size (weighted mean differences, WMD) of handgrip strength (HGS) and  **timed-up and go test (TUG)**  with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was obtained to compare reported results across the included RCTs.

Results: A total of 19 trials were included in this systematic review, among which 13 trials were eligible for the meta-analysis. 

In the 13 included studies, supplementing with vitamin D produced a weighted mean difference of 0.876 kg (95% CI = 0.180 to 1.571, P = 0.014, I2 = 68.5%) for HGS, a measurement of muscle strength. However, an insignificant decrease of 0.044 s was observed after analyzing the TUG (95% CI = -0.979 to 0.892, P = 0.927, I2 = 95%). According to subgroup analysis, vitamin D supplementation increased HGS in patients over the age of 60 (P = 0.001), in those without calcium supplementation (P = 0.032), and in those whose baseline vitamin D level was greater than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml) (P = 0.003).

Conclusions: Taking into account the studies in this systematic review, vitamin D supplementation improved muscle strength in postmenopausal women. However, an insignificant result was demonstrated in terms of mobility after vitamin D supplementation.
