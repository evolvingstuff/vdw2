INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D insufficiency is related to acute medical conditions known to increase the risk of short-term death in older adults. The objective of this study was to determine whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were associated with the occurrence of in-hospital mortality in geriatric acute care settings while taking into account all characteristics likely to improve the rate of in-hospital mortality. 

METHODS: Three hundred ninety-nine Caucasian adults admitted between January and October 2009 to the geriatric acute care unit of Angers University Hospital, France were included in this cross-sectional study. 

The occurrence of all-cause in-hospital death and the measurement of serum 25OHD were assessed. 

* Age, 

* gender, 

* body mass index, 

* supine systolic blood pressure, 

* numbers of acute diseases, 

* chronic diseases, and 

* hospital days, 

* serum albumin, 

* creatinine clearance, and 

* season of hospital admission

were used as potential confounders. 

RESULTS: Mean serum 25OHD was 34.88+/-1.7 nmol/L. Seventeen deaths occurred in the acute care unit.

 **Only serum 25OHD concentration was significantly and independently associated with in-hospital death**  

(adjusted odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> 0.65; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.96; P=0.029 for full adjusted logistic regression. OR 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.99; P=0.029 fo or step-wise backward model). 

CONCLUSION: Increased serum 25OHD concentrations were associated with a low in-hospital mortality rate in this cohort of acute care geriatric inpatients. 

It is not only a new orientation of research, but also an additional argument for prescribing vitamin D in deficient older adults.
