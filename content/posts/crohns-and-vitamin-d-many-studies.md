#### Vitamins D and B12 are the most frequently reported deficiences with Crohn's Disease - Nov 2023

 **Micronutrient Status in Adult Crohn's Disease during Clinical Remission: A Systematic Review** 

Nutrients. 2023 Nov 14;15(22):4777. [doi: 10.3390/nu15224777.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15224777.)

Adults with Crohn's disease (CD) may be at risk of micronutrient insufficiency in clinical remission through restrictive eating, malabsorption, abnormal losses or inflammation. This systematic review synthesises the literature on micronutrient insufficiency in CD in clinical remission in terms of the prevalence of low circulating micronutrient concentrations and as a comparison against a healthy control (HC). Studies were included if the population was predominantly in remission. A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria; 12 were rated as low quality, leaving 30 studies covering 21 micronutrients of medium/high quality that were included in the synthesis. 

 **Vitamins D and B12 were the most frequently reported nutrients**  (8 and 11); there were few eligible studies for the remaining micronutrients. 

The prevalence studies were consistent in reporting individuals with low 

* Vitamins 

   * A, 

   * B6, 

   * B12

   * C, 

   * Î²-carotene, 

   *  **D** , 

* Magnesium, 

* Selenium and 

* Zinc. 

The comparator studies were inconsistent in finding differences with CD populations; 

Vitamin D, the most reported nutrient, was only lower than the HC in one-quarter of the studies. 

Adult CD populations are likely to contain individuals with low levels of one or more micronutrients, with the most substantial evidence for Vitamins D and B12. The studies on other micronutrients are of insufficient number, standardisation and quality to inform practice.

#### Half as many Crohn's relapses if regularly take Vitamin D - Dec 2022

 **Effectiveness of Vitamin D Supplementation on Disease Course in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients: Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis** 

Inflamm Bowel Dis . 2022 Dec 29;izac253. [doi: 10.1093/ibd/izac253](https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izac253)

Background: The vitamin D role in bone metabolism is well known; however, recent evidence suggests the impact of vitamin D in immune modulation and its implications in immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Method: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis by a specific protocol (PROSPERO: CRD42022311184; March 2022, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=311184). Randomized clinical trials involving IBD patients treated with vitamin D supplementation, compared with placebo, that evaluated the risk of clinical relapse and disease activity were included. Literature search was performed using Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL through January 2022.

Results: Out of 1448 articles, 12 (11 full-texts and 1 abstract) were included. Seven randomized clinical trials reported data on the clinical relapse as dichotomous outcome, while 7 studies reported data on disease activity expressed as continuous variables. The pooled risk ratio of clinical relapse was 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.89; I2 = 25%) among 458 IBD patients. However, this seems to be solid only in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In fact, only 2 studies, involving 67 patients with ulcerative colitis, were included in the analysis. CD patients in clinical remission had a strong significant risk reduction in clinical relapse (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.82; I2 = 0%), suggesting that it could be a specific subgroup with maximum clinical benefit of vitamin D supplementation.

Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of clinical relapse in IBD patients, especially in CD patients in clinical remission. In a subgroup analysis, it was not significant (due to small number of studies and low number of patients), and well-powered studies are needed, in particular for ulcerative colitis patients.
