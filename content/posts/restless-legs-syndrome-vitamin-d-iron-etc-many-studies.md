#### RLS review by [Perplexity AI Jan 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/restless-legs-syndrome-appears-6EckWsmNQHO2qDMW.Pckqg)

 **Restless Legs Syndrome appears to be treated by at least Vitamin D, Vitamin K, Iron and Magnesium.   
Are there others? Which is best? Is there some combination which is best?** 

Based on the available evidence, several vitamins and minerals have been studied 

for treating Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), with varying levels of effectiveness:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Proven Effective Supplements</span>** 

 **Iron** 

* Most strongly supported by research for RLS treatment

* Particularly effective when ferritin levels are ≤75 μg/L &nbsp;[6](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003388)

* Should be taken with vitamin C for better absorption &nbsp;[6](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003388)

* Iron therapy shows significant improvement in RLS symptoms compared to placebo in iron-deficient patients &nbsp;[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34764852/)

 **Vitamins C and E** 

* Demonstrated significant effectiveness both alone and in combination &nbsp;[7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22317944/)

* Particularly beneficial for hemodialysis patients with RLS &nbsp;[7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22317944/)

* Standard dosage: Vitamin C (200 mg) and Vitamin E (400 mg) &nbsp;[6](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000003388)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Other Supplements with Limited Evidence</span>** 

 **Magnesium** 

* May help with RLS symptoms when combined with vitamin B6 &nbsp;[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11280425/)

* Evidence remains inconclusive for magnesium alone &nbsp;[40](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-vitamins-help-restless-leg-syndrome)

 **Vitamin B Complex** 

* Vitamin B6 shows promise when combined with magnesium &nbsp;[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11280425/)

* Limited evidence for B12 effectiveness &nbsp;[40](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-vitamins-help-restless-leg-syndrome)

 **Vitamin D** 

* Despite high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in RLS patients, supplementation has not shown significant benefits &nbsp;[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11280425/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Best Approach</span>** 

The most effective supplementation strategy appears to be:

1. Iron supplementation (with vitamin C) if ferritin levels are low &nbsp;[15](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-you-missing-this-simple-treatment-for-restless-legs)

1. Combined vitamin C and E supplementation as a secondary approach &nbsp;[7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22317944/)

1. Consider magnesium with vitamin B6 as an additional support &nbsp;[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11280425/)

It's important to note that supplement effectiveness varies by individual and underlying conditions. 

Blood tests should be conducted to identify specific deficiencies before starting supplementation &nbsp;[15](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/are-you-missing-this-simple-treatment-for-restless-legs)

Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, 

as excessive amounts of certain nutrients can be harmful &nbsp;[40](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-vitamins-help-restless-leg-syndrome)

#### RLS: genes and glutamate - meta-analysis June 2024

 **Genome-wide meta-analyses of restless legs syndrome yield insights into genetic architecture, disease biology and risk prediction**

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects up to 10% of older adults. Their healthcare is impeded by delayed diagnosis and insufficient treatment. To advance disease prediction and find new entry points for therapy, we performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies in 116,647 individuals with RLS (cases) and 1,546,466 controls of European ancestry. The pooled analysis increased the number of risk loci eightfold to 164, including three on chromosome X. Sex-specific meta-analyses revealed largely overlapping genetic predispositions of the sexes (rg = 0.96). Locus annotation prioritized druggable genes such as  **glutamate**  receptors 1 and 4, and Mendelian randomization indicated RLS as a causal risk factor for diabetes. Machine learning approaches combining genetic and nongenetic information performed best in risk prediction (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82–0.91). In summary, we identified targets for drug development and repurposing, prioritized potential causal relationships between RLS and relevant comorbidities and risk factors for follow-up and provided evidence that nonlinear interactions are likely relevant to RLS risk prediction.

#### Vitamin D and Restless Legs Syndrome: A Review of Current Literature - April 2023

Tremor Other Hyperkinet Mov (N Y). 2023; 13: 12. [doi: 10.5334/tohm.741](https://doi.org/10.5334/tohm.741)

This review presents a detailed summary of the current literature regarding RLS and vitamin D deficiency. To our knowledge it is the first review of its kind. We review the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in RLS as well as the evidence for the use of vitamin D supplementation in RLS management. We further examine the literature for proteomic and genetic evidence of a role for vitamin D in the pathogenesis of RLS. An alteration in vitamin D binding protein in RLS is one of the most consistent findings in the proteomic studies. Furthermore, we examine the interaction of vitamin D with calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone and the possible role of these connections in RLS. We also explore the possible nexus between RLS and vitamin D in renal disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as inflammation. In addition, we review the potential interaction between vitamin D and RLS with iron, dopamine and other neurotransmitter systems including the endogenous opiate, serotoninergic, glutamatergic and adenosinergic systems. We also explore the role of vitamin D in RLS Augmentation (i.e., the paradoxical worsening of RLS symptoms when dopaminergic agents are used as a therapy for RLS). Although the literature is not entirely consistent in affirming vitamin D deficiency in RLS or the amelioration of RLS symptoms with vitamin D therapy, the collective studies overall indicate that vitamin D deficiency is common enough in RLS patients to suggest that RLS patients should have their vitamin D levels checked and any deficiency corrected as a standard of care.

#### RLS treated by weekly 50,000 IU of vitamin D - Feb 2020

 **The Effect of Vitamin D on Restless Legs Syndrome: Prospective Self-Controlled Case Study** 

Sleep Breath, 2020 Feb 20, DOI: 10.1007/s11325-019-01984-3

Mesude Tutuncu 1, Melih Tutuncu 2

Purpose: To evaluate the effect of vitamin D on the severity of restless legs syndrome in patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS).

Methods: Patients with idiopathic RLS completed questionnaires, including the International Restless Legs Severity Scale (IRLSS), and were evaluated for vitamin D deficiency. Patients with vitamin D deficiency were treated with 50,000 units per week for 2 months. At the end of the 2 months, vitamin D levels were re-measured, and disease severity was re-evaluated in patients who reached adequate vitamin D levels. Subgroups of the IRLSS questionnaire were also analyzed.

Results: Of 35 patients enrolled, 21 (60%) had vitamin D deficiency and received vitamin D therapy. In 2 patients, vitamin D levels did not rise to sufficient levels with supplementation, and these 2 patients were excluded from analysis. The remaining 19 patients showed

* vitamin D levels increased from 13.2 ± 4.0 to 42.8 ± 9.6 ng/mL while

* IRLSS improved from 24.9 ± 5.1 to 21.1 ± 2.9 points (p <0.001).

Selected subscores of the IRLSS were also improved, including

* symptom severity (p <0.001),

* impact on sleep (p <0.001),

* symptom measures (p =0.002), and

* disease impact measures (p <0.001).

There were trends toward improvement in subscores of frequency (p =0.11) and mood (p =0.051).

Conclusions: The findings suggest that vitamin D levels should be evaluated in patients with RLS, and if vitamin D deficiency is revealed, consideration should be given to replacement therapy

#### RLS 3 X more likely if < 20 ng/mL of Vitamin D (8X if a teacher) – March 2018

 **The Association Between Vitamin D Level and Restless Legs Syndrome: A Population-Based Case-Control Study.** 

J Clin Sleep Med. 2018 Mar 30. pii: jc-17-00496.

Wali S, Alsafadi S, Abaalkhail B, Ramadan I, Abulhamail B, Kousa M, Alshamrani R, Faruqui H, Faruqui A, Alama M, Hamed M.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: The pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) may be related to abnormalities in central dopamine pathways. Vitamin D may play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS by modulating the dopaminergic system. The aim of our study is to examine the possible link between RLS and vitamin D deficiency.

METHODS: The total number of subjects enrolled was 201, including 78 patients with RLS based on the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) diagnostic criteria and 123 controls. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were measured in both groups. The IRLSSG symptom severity rating scale assessed RLS severity in all cases.

RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with RLS (75.6%) and 52 controls (42.3%) had a diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, P< .001. The odds ratio (OR) of the development of RLS was 4.24 for those with a vitamin D level < 50 nmol/L compared to those with a vitamin D level ≥ 50 nmol/L (P< .001, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 2.3-7.9).

After adjusting for all other significant factors in the multivariate logistic model, vitamin D was significantly associated with RLS (OR 3.1, P< .002, 95% CI 1.51-6.38).

Moreover, a dark or black skin color (OR 3.4, P< .001, 95% CI 1.5-6.3) and working as a teacher (OR 8.8, P< .001, 95% CI 3.4-23.5) were also independently significantly associated with RLS.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified an association between vitamin D deficiency and RLS. Consequently, vitamin D deficiency should be considered in the management of RLS. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the causality relationship between vitamin D levels and RLS.

Restless legs syndrome is a chronic progressive sleep-associated sensory-motor disorder that develops within neurological disorders like Parkinsonism, Neuropathy pain, and possible dementia. The global prevalence of restless legs syndrome is increasing daily, and research studies have reported the essential need for research in specific diagnosis and treatment of restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome is more prevalent in females and pregnant women than men in almost the world. In India and many other countries of Asia and throughout the world, the term Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is still a questionnaire. It is reported many a time by Physicians, Neurologists, and Gynecologists as a mal-diagnosis of Restless legs syndrome in India and in other countries also. The exact pathophysiology of the RLS is still unclear, but some superficial assumptions regarding the progressions of disease and the root of disease through the gene molecular concepts. Few Traditional Chinese medicine and allopathic medicine have been reported as successful treatment of RLS, but it is either symptomatic or depends on time management. Dopamine Agonists and opioids are possible symptomatic treatments for RLS, but no treatment is available if it has entered a severe stage of RLS. Relations to the lower cerebral ferric and Dopamine levels are probably...

#### Restless legs syndrome associated with (a few) major diseases -A systematic review and new concept - April 2016

Neurology 86 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000002542

Claudia Trenkwalder, Richard Allen, Birgit Högl, Walter Paulus, Juliane Winkelmann

Recent publications on both the genetics and environmental factors of restless legs syndrome (RLS), defined as a clinical disorder, suggest that overlapping genetic risk factors may play a role in primary (idiopathic) and secondary (symptomatic) RLS. Following a systematic literature search of RLS associated with comorbidities, we identified only an increased prevalence of RLS in  **iron deficiency and kidney disease.** 

In

* cardiovascular disease,

* arterial hypertension,

* diabetes,

* migraine, and

* Parkinson disease

the methodology of the studies was poor, but **an association might be possible** .

There is insufficient evidence for conditions such as anemia (without iron deficiency), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, headache, stroke, narcolepsy, and ataxias. Based on possible gene–microenvironmental interaction, the classifications primary and secondary RLS may suggest an inappropriate causal relation. We recognize that in some conditions, treatment of the underlying disease should be achieved as far as possible to reduce or eliminate RLS symptoms. RLS might be seen as a continuous spectrum with a major genetic contribution at one end and a major environmental or comorbid disease contribution at the other.

#### RLS score dropped from 26 to 10 after Vitamin D levels were raised to just 25 ng - Aug 2014

 **The effect of vitamin D supplements on the severity of restless legs syndrome** 

Sleep Breath. 2014 Aug 23. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-014-1049-y

Wali S1, Shukr A, Boudal A, Alsaiari A, Krayem A.

1Sleep Medicine and Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, sowali@kau.edu.sa.

PURPOSE:

Clinical observation hinted at improved symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS) after vitamin D supplements. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the severity of RLS symptoms.

METHODS:

Twelve adult subjects diagnosed with primary RLS and vitamin D deficiency were recruited. Patients with secondary RLS were excluded from this study. The complete cell count; serum levels of ferritin, iron, glycated hemoglobin, and vitamin D3 (25 (OH) vitamin D); and renal and bone profiles of the patients were assayed. Patients with vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) were treated with vitamin D3 supplements  **(high oral dose or intramuscular injection)** . The severity scores of RLS were reassessed after the vitamin D3 level was corrected to >50 nmol/l and compared with those before the administration of the supplements.

RESULTS:

The median pretreatment vitamin D level was 21.7 nmol/l (13.45-57.4), which improved to 61.8 nmol/l (42.58-95.9) (P = 0.002) with the treatment.  **The median RLS severity score improved**  significantly from  **26**  (15-35) at baseline to  **10**  (0-27) after correction of the vitamin D levels (P = 0.002).

CONCLUSION:

This study indicates that vitamin D supplementation improves the severity of RLS symptoms and advocates that vitamin D deficiency is conceivably associated with RLS.

#### Restless Legs Syndrome 5X more likely if vitamin D deficient - May 2014

 **Possible association between vitamin D deficiency and restless legs syndrome** 

Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat. 2014 May 21;10:953-8. Doi 10.2147/NDT.S63599. eCollection 2014.

Oran M1, Unsal C2, Albayrak Y2, Tulubas F3, Oguz K4, Avci O1, Turgut N4, Alp R4, Gurel A3.

BACKGROUND AND AIM:

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distressing sleep disorder that occurs worldwide. Although there have been recent developments in understanding the pathophysiology of RLS, the exact mechanism of the disease has not been well elucidated. An increased prevalence of neurologic and psychiatric diseases involving dopaminergic dysfunction in vitamin D-deficient patients led us to hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency might result in dopaminergic dysfunction and, consequently, the development of RLS (in which dopaminergic dysfunction plays a pivotal role). Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and RLS.

METHODS:

One hundred and fifty-five consecutive patients, 18-65 years of age, who were admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine with musculoskeletal symptoms and who subsequently underwent neurological and electromyography (EMG) examination by the same senior neurologist, were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (a vitamin D metabolite used as a measure of vitamin D status) level: 36 patients with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥20 ng/mL comprised the normal vitamin D group, and 119 patients with serum 25(OH)D levels <20 ng/mL comprised the vitamin D deficiency group. The two groups were compared for the presence of RLS and associated factors.

RESULTS:

The two groups were similar in terms of mean age, sex, mean body mass index (BMI), and serum levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ferritin. The presence of RLS was significantly higher in the vitamin D deficiency group (χ (2)=12.87, P<0.001). Regression analysis showed vitamin D deficiency and serum 25(OH)D level to be significantly associated with the presence of RLS (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>  **5.085** , P<0.001 and OR 1.047, P=0.006, respectively).

CONCLUSION:

The present study demonstrated a possible association between vitamin D deficiency and RLS. Given the dopaminergic effects of vitamin D, 25(OH)D depletion may lead to dopaminergic dysfunction and may have a place in the etiology of RLS. Prospective vitamin D treatment studies are needed to confirm this relationship and to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D as a treatment for RLS patients.
