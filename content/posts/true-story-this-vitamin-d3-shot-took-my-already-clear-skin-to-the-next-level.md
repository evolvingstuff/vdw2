* “…what I did notice was that my skin glowed up”

* “I started getting compliments and could see the obvious change myself”

* “My favorite way to consume the oil is to add the package’s recommended dosage into a shot glass with equal parts ginger and lemon or lime juice”

* Does not mention dose size, pre-existing Vitamin D level

* Does mention lots of references to vitamin D eliminating skin problems, but nothing about improving already healthy skin

* Product she uses: each liquid drop contains 1,400 IU of Vitamin D3 and 25mcg of Vitamin K (as MK-7)

#### Comments by founder of VitaminDWiki

* I used a similar Vitamin D and Vitamin K  combination a few years ago to [successfully erase riased veins on the back of my hand](/posts/raised-veins-on-my-left-hand-are-no-longer-raised) with a single drop per day in about 2 weeks

* Suspect that she used about 5,000 IU internally (5 drops) and noticed the benefit in a month or two

* Suspect that she could have used a single drop on each side of her face and noticed the benefits on her face in a week or two.

* Vitamin D creams are also available on Amazon - which probably work as well

* I now make my own vitamin D water (for a mouthwash) by dissolving bulk Vitamin D (Amazon too)  in water.– at about 1/ 10 the cost
