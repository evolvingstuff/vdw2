Objectives; To determine the level of vitamin D in Patients with Meniere's disease (MD) and investigate the effect of its supplementation on the frequency and duration of MD attacks.

Patient and methods:  A matched case/control study was conducted. Vitamin D serum level was estimated in patients with MD before and 3 months after its administration. The degree of improvement in frequency and duration of MD attacks was calculated.

Results; Our study included 112 persons (28 cases and 84 controls). Low serum levels of vitamin D were detected in MD patients. In addition, we found a significant statistical difference  **Dizziness Handicapped Inventory**  (DHI) Questionnaire before and after vitamin D supplementation (p<0.0001).

Conclusions: The current study found that MD patients had lower serum vitamin D levels. There appears to be a link between vitamin D and MD, and this study looked at a correlation rather than establishing causation. Also vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial role in controlling Meniere's disease symptoms and lowering frequency of occurrence of the disease.
