Background: Observational studies suggest that blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are associated with morbidity, viral suppression, and mortality among adults living with HIV.

Objective: We evaluated the effect of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation on the risk of HIV disease progression, HIV-1 viral suppression, comorbidities, weight change, and depression among HIV-infected individuals that were initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 supplementation among 4,000 HIV-infected adult men and non-pregnant women initiating ART with insufficient serum 25(OH)D concentrations (<30 ng/mL). Participants were randomized to receive either weekly 50,000 IU doses for four weeks followed by daily 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 until 1-year or a matching placebo regimen given in weekly followed by daily doses until 1-year. Participants were followed-up at weekly visits for the first month followed by monthly visits thereafter. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses to assess the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the secondary trial outcomes of HIV progression or death, viral suppression, comorbidities, change in body mass index (BMI), >10% weight loss, incident wasting, and depression.

Results: During follow-up, 345 participants (17.2%) in the vitamin D3 group and 371 participants (18.6%) in the placebo group experienced HIV disease progression or death and there was no difference in risk between groups (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.79-1.06). Vitamin D3 supplementation did not affect the risk of an unsuppressed HIV-1 viral load (>1000 copies/mL) after 6 months (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.87-1.41) and there was also no effect on change in BMI, risk of >10% weight loss, wasting, comorbidities and depression (p-values >0.05).

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation did not affect the risk of HIV progression, viral suppression, common morbidities, weight-related indicators, or depression among adults initiating ART in Tanzania. The trial was registered at clinicaltrial.gov as NCT01798680.
