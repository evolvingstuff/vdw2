#### Report on April 2016 study

* [Congenital Zika Syndrome](http://www.virology.ws/2016/03/08/congenital-zika-syndrome/) - Virology Blog

> fetal abnormalities were detected in 12 of the 42 Zika virus positive women ( **29%** ) 

> none of the Zika virus negative women.

> "The infections of these pregnant women with Zika virus  **took place throughout pregnancy** , from week 8 to week 35. This window of susceptibility is in contrast to rubella virus which is more likely to cause birth defects when infection occurs in the first trimester"

> "Not only do rubella and Zika viruses cause similar fetal and placental abnormalities, in the mother they both lead to rash, joint pain, skin itching, and lymphadenopathy without high fever."

> "Hopefully the similarities between rubella virus and Zika virus will stop there:  **it took nearly 30 years to develop a rubella virus vaccine**  after the discovery that infection caused birth defects."

#### Zika fever and congenital Zika syndrome: An unexpected emerging arboviral disease - May 2016

Journal of Infection May 2016Volume 72, Issue 5, Pages 507–524, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2016.02.011 |

 **Highlights** 

•Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus.

•Probable transplacental and sexual transmissions of ZIKV have been reported.

•Congenital ZIKV infection may be associated with microcephaly and other anomalies.

•Laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses.

•The expanding ZIKV epidemic may be related to environmental and viral changes.

Summary

Unlike its mosquito-borne relatives, such as dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, which can cause severe human diseases, Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged from obscurity by its association with a suspected “congenital Zika syndrome”, while causing asymptomatic or mild exanthematous febrile infections which are dengue- or rubella-like in infected individuals. Despite having been discovered in Uganda for almost 60 years, <20 human cases were reported before 2007. The massive epidemics in the Pacific islands associated with the ZIKV Asian lineage in 2007 and 2013 were followed by explosive outbreaks in Latin America in 2015. Although increased mosquito breeding associated with the El Niño effect superimposed on global warming is suspected, genetic changes in its RNA virus genome may have led to better adaptation to mosquitoes, other animal reservoirs, and human. We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention of this emerging infection. Laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses. Besides mosquito bite and transplacental transmission, the risk of other potential routes of transmission by transfusion, transplantation, sexual activity, breastfeeding, respiratory droplet, and animal bite is discussed. Epidemic control requires adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds, personal protection against mosquito bite, and hopefully a safe and effective vaccine.
