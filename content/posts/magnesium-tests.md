#### Serum Magnesium

Serum is the clear, liquid part of blood, which does not include the red and white blood cells, platelets, and clotting proteins found in whole blood. While serum magnesium is the most widely used measurement for magnesium status (often used in doctors’ and medical offices), it has been [recognized as unreliable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28806179/) for diagnosing most cases of magnesium deficiency, especially chronic or subclinical deficiency. Many studies have found a correlation between low magnesium intake and increased risk of disease, however, this relationship often does not correlate with serum magnesium levels.

The “normal” range of serum magnesium has been defined as 0.7 to 1 mmol/L. As explained above, less than 1% of total body magnesium is found in the serum. Also, due to the tight control of serum magnesium levels, levels of magnesium in the serum stop increasing in response to supplementation before truly sufficient levels of magnesium are reached throughout the body. This means that, while low serum magnesium is likely a good indicator of magnesium deficiency, serum magnesium within the accepted range does not indicate sufficient magnesium status throughout the body.

#### Red Blood Cell (RBC) and Whole Blood Magnesium

Red blood cell (RBC) magnesium measures the amount of magnesium in the red blood cells alone. While this is a better indicator of magnesium status than the serum magnesium measurement (it is more reflective of magnesium status within tissues), it is still not as accurate as the whole blood magnesium measurement. The whole blood magnesium includes the measure of magnesium in all types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, etc.) as well as the serum, which is a better indicator of magnesium status in the body and tissues than either the serum magnesium or RBC magnesium alone.

The [dried blood spot magnesium test offered by GrassrootsHealth](https://daction.grassrootshealth.net/product/custom-test-kit-builder/) measures the whole blood magnesium, with the option to add other essential and toxic elements (copper, selenium, zinc, mercury, cadmium and lead). The reference range of the whole blood magnesium test is 29-51 mg/L, which is the range of the average population the lab serves, and does not necessarily indicate the optimal range for health. Aiming for the higher end of this range is likely a good target to help ensure you are getting enough magnesium and to avoid magnesium deficiency.

#### Ionized Magnesium Blood Test

The [Ionized Magnesium Blood Test](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/5/1245), which measures the circulating ionized magnesium (iMg2+) in whole blood, is difficult to obtain and is expensive, however, it is a more accurate reflection of magnesium status than serum, RBC, and whole blood magnesium. This blood test measures the free, bioactive form of ionized magnesium (unbound from its organic and/or inorganic anions), and is helpful for determining the amount of bioavailable magnesium available to the tissues through the blood.
