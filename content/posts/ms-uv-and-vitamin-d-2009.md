This collective review focuses on three major factors that influence the incidences of multiple sclerosis (MS) to include ultraviolet radiation (UVR), vitamin D3 supplementation, and vitamin D receptor gene (VDRG) polymorphisms. In general, the rate of MS increases with latitude. Individuals tend to carry their original risk with them if they migrate to a different latitude after adolescence. 

It is important to emphasize that UVR increases the synthesis of vitamin D3, which has a known immune suppressant action via the VDRG. 

Clinical studies have pointed out that vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate the development of MS. 

Because vitamin D3 is an inhibitor of MS, providing supplemental D3 for individuals at risk for MS should be mandatory.

There is unanimous agreement that exposure to UVR and vitamin D3 supplementation can reduce the incidence of MS. 

Although there is debate regarding the association of MS with the use of silver mercury fillings, there is general agreement throughout the world that there is a need for dental-patient informed-consent brochures for all dentists who use dental restoration materials. For the dentists who remove silver mercury amalgam from their patients, there is a uniform international agreement that all dental offices should use reliable debris collection devices that prevent pollution of our environment.
