#### Patterns of vitamin D testing and supplementation for children with inflammatory bowel disease in Australasia

JGH Open . 2024 Mar 4;8(3):e13041. [doi: 10.1002/jgh3.13041](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.13041)

Angharad Vernon-Roberts 1, Andrew S Day 1; PEDiatric Australasian Gastroenterology REsearch NEtwork (PEDAGREE)

Background and aim: For children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), optimal levels of vitamin D are ascribed anti-inflammatory and essential immune system roles that are associated with reduced disease activity, lower postoperative recurrence, and higher quality of life. International guidelines for vitamin D testing and supplementation provide inconsistent recommendations. The aim of this study was to survey Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists to ascertain current practices of vitamin D testing and supplementation for children with IBD.

Methods: Members of the Australian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition were invited to complete an online survey. Respondents were asked to provide information on frequency of vitamin D testing and supplementation, adherence, and benefits of vitamin D to children with IBD.

Results: Thirty-two (54%) pediatric gastroenterologists completed the survey: 27 (84%) from Australia and 5 (16%) from New Zealand. The majority (90%) tested vitamin D levels at diagnosis and follow up, although testing frequency varied (1-3 times/year) and only 8 (28%) tested seasonally. While 28 (88%) recommended supplementation based on serum levels, inconsistent cutoff values were used. Most respondents (n = 27) recommended Stoss (single dose) or vitamin D3 (daily for 8-12 weeks). The majority (84%) rated the overall benefit of optimal vitamin D levels at ≥6/10, although fewer (54%) rated the benefit to disease activity at ≥6/10.

Conclusions: The results indicate that standardized guidelines for vitamin D testing and supplementation for clinicians caring for children with IBD throughout Australasia are required. Consensus statements may optimize the care of children with IBD in this diverse geographical region.

!!!!Patterns of vitamin D testing and supplementation for children with inflammatory bowel disease in Australasia
JGH Open . 2024 Mar 4;8(3):e13041. doi: 10.1002/jgh3.13041
Angharad Vernon-Roberts 1, Andrew S Day 1; PEDiatric Australasian Gastroenterology REsearch NEtwork (PEDAGREE)

Background and aim: For children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), optimal levels of vitamin D are ascribed anti-inflammatory and essential immune system roles that are associated with reduced disease activity, lower postoperative recurrence, and higher quality of life. International guidelines for vitamin D testing and supplementation provide inconsistent recommendations. The aim of this study was to survey Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists to ascertain current practices of vitamin D testing and supplementation for children with IBD.

Methods: Members of the Australian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition were invited to complete an online survey. Respondents were asked to provide information on frequency of vitamin D testing and supplementation, adherence, and benefits of vitamin D to children with IBD.

Results: Thirty-two (54%) pediatric gastroenterologists completed the survey: 27 (84%) from Australia and 5 (16%) from New Zealand. The majority (90%) tested vitamin D levels at diagnosis and follow up, although testing frequency varied (1-3 times/year) and only 8 (28%) tested seasonally. While 28 (88%) recommended supplementation based on serum levels, inconsistent cutoff values were used. Most respondents (n = 27) recommended Stoss (single dose) or vitamin D3 (daily for 8-12 weeks). The majority (84%) rated the overall benefit of optimal vitamin D levels at ≥6/10, although fewer (54%) rated the benefit to disease activity at ≥6/10.

Conclusions: The results indicate that standardized guidelines for vitamin D testing and supplementation for clinicians caring for children with IBD throughout Australasia are required. Consensus statements may optimize the care of children with IBD in this diverse geographical region.
