 **Comment by the founder of VitaminDWiki** 

* Probably would have had much more weight loss if had repleted Vitamin D BEFORE the diet and exercise portion of the program.  

* The Vitamin D would have been virtually useless in the first month or two of this 3-month program

* Repletion can take 8-12 weeks if given bi-weekly (1,200,000 = 12 week X 100,000 IU)

* Repletion  <2 weeks if given all within a single week (e.g. 170,000 daily)
