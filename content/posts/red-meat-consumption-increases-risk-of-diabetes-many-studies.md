Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that occurs in the body because of decreased insulin activity and/or insulin secretion. The incidence of T2DM has rapidly increased over recent decades. The relation between consumption of different types of red meats and risk of T2DM remains uncertain. This meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations of processed red meat (PRM) and unprocessed red meat (URM) consumption with T2DM. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library for English-language cohort studies published before January 2021. Summary relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using fixed effects and random effects. Additionally, dose–response relationships were explored using meta-regression. 

Fifteen studies (n =  **682,963 participants cases = 50,675** ) were identified. Compared with the lowest intake group, high consumption of PRM and URM increased T2DM risk by 27% (95% CI 1.15–1.40) and 15% (95% CI 1.08–1.23), respectively. These relationships were consistently strongest for U.S-based studies, though the effects of sex are inconclusive. In conclusion, PRM and URM are both positively associated with T2DM incidence, and these relationships are strongest in the U.S. reduction of red meat consumption should be explored as a target for T2DM prevention initiatives

Background

Greater consumption of red meat has been associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A decreased intake of red meat and simultaneous increased intake of other high-protein foods may be associated with a lower risk of T2DM. These analyses of specific food replacements for red meat may provide more accurate dietary advice.

Objective

We examined the association between a decrease in intake of red meat accompanied by an increase in other major dietary protein sources and risk of T2DM.

Methods

We prospectively followed 27,634 males in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 46,023 females in the Nurses’ Health Study, and 75,196 females in the Nurses’ Health Study II. Diet was assessed by a validated FFQ and updated every 4 y. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for T2DM risk factors were used to model the food replacements. We calculated HRs and 95% CIs for the T2DM risk associated with replacements of 1 daily serving of red meat with another protein source.

Results

During 2,113,245 person-years of follow-up, we identified 8763 incident T2DM cases from 1990 to 2013. In the pooled analyses, a decrease in total red meat intake during a 4-y period replaced with another common protein food was associated with a lower risk of T2DM in the subsequent 4-y period. The HR (95% CI) per 1 serving/d was 0.82 (0.75, 0.90) for poultry, 0.87 (0.77, 0.98) for seafood, 0.82 (0.78, 0.86) for low-fat dairy, 0.82 (0.77, 0.86) for high-fat dairy, 0.90 (0.81, 0.99) for eggs, 0.89 (0.82, 0.98) for legumes, and 0.83 (0.78, 0.89) for nuts. The associations were present for both unprocessed and processed red meat, although stronger for the replacement of processed red meat.

Conclusions

Replacing red meat consumption with other protein sources was associated with a lower risk of T2DM.

Disease risk factors identified in epidemiological studies serve as important public health tools, helping clinicians identify individuals who may benefit from more aggressive screening or risk-modification procedures, allowing policymakers to prioritize intervention programs, and encouraging at-risk individuals to modify behavior and improve their health. These factors have been based primarily on evidence from cross-sectional and prospective studies, as most do not lend themselves to randomized trials. While some risk factors are not modifiable, eating habits are subject to change through both individual action and broader policy initiatives. Meat consumption has been frequently investigated as a variable associated with diabetes risk, but it has not yet been described as a diabetes risk factor. In this article, we evaluate the evidence supporting the use of meat consumption as a clinically useful risk factor for type 2 diabetes, based on studies evaluating the risks associated with meat consumption as a categorical dietary characteristic (i.e., meat consumption versus no meat consumption), as a scalar variable (i.e., gradations of meat consumption), or as part of a broader dietary pattern.

##### It appears that a good level of vitamin D and Magnesium reduces risk more than by not eating meat

 **Both appear to treat diabetes as well**

#### How excess dietary saturated fats induce insulin resistance – Oct 2021

Excess dietary saturated fatty acids can increase the risk of and progression of type 2 diabetes. We will explore the mechanisms by which excess saturated fatty acids can reduce insulin sensitivity, suppress insulin production of beta cells through glucolipotoxicity, raise blood glucose, and lessen energy production in cells. 

 **Higher dietary saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid, can reduce the number of insulin receptors to approximately one-half of their normal number.**  This contributes to hyperinsulinemia, elevated blood glucose, and reduced mitochondrial energy production. Higher dietary saturated fatty acids also interfere with the signaling between the insulin receptor and the glucose transporter. This reduces the amount of glucose that can enter the cell and increases the risk of elevated blood glucose. Excess dietary saturated fatty acids have been found to suppress insulin production of beta cells and also to stimulate apoptosis of beta cells. Higher dietary saturated fatty acids can reduce the ability of the cells to produce glycogen from glucose, thus lowering energy storage. Finally, higher dietary saturated fatty acids can reduce mitochondrial energy production. Conclusion: Reducing dietary saturated fatty acids may help clear blood of excess glucose in type 2 diabetes.
