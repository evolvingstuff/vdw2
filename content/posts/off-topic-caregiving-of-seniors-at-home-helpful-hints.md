In June 2015 my wife and I invited her 102 year-old father, Ken to live with us.

He had been in a senior home.

We are in our early 70’s and retired.

Ken has a very sharp mind (I had been playing duplicate bridge with him for several years)

Ken has no chronic illnesses, never broken a bone

Ken has very poor hearing, poor sight.

Caregiving is very stressful, even with the aid of hired caregivers in both morning and evening.

It takes me about 5 hours daily to care for Ken (decreasing my time for VitaminDWiki website)

I just wanted to share with you what we have done to somewhat reduce the stress

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ken played Bridge on his 104th birthday and died of "failure to thrive" a month later
