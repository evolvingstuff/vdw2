#### Spatial distribution differences of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in healthy elderly people under the influence of geographical environmental factors

Sci Rep. 2022 Jul 27;12(1):12781. [doi: 10.1038/s41598-022-17198-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17198-9)

The main targets of this were to screen the factors that may influence the distribution of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> reference value in healthy elderly people in China, and further explored the geographical distribution differences of 25(OH)D reference value in China. In this study, we collected the 25(OH)D of 25,470 healthy elderly from 58 cities in China to analyze the correlation between 25(OH)D and 22 geography secondary indexes through spearman regression analysis. Six indexes with significant correlation were extracted, and a ridge regression model was built, and the country's urban healthy elderly'25(OH)D reference value was predicted. By using the disjunctive Kriging method, we obtained the geographical distribution of 25(OH)D reference values for healthy elderly people in China. 

The reference value of 25(OH)D for healthy elderly in China was significantly correlated with the 6 secondary indexes, namely, 

1. latitude (°), 

1. annual temperature range (°C), 

1. annual sunshine hours (h), 

1. annual mean temperature (°C), 

1. annual mean relative humidity (%), and 

1. annual precipitation (mm). 

The geographical distribution of 25(OH)D values of healthy elderly in China showed a trend of being higher in South China and lower in North China, and higher in coastal areas and lower in inland areas. This study lays a foundation for further research on the mechanism of different influencing factors on the reference value of 25(OH)D index. A ridge regression model composed of significant influencing factors has been established to provide the basis for formulating reference criteria for the treatment factors of the vitamin D deficiency and prognostic factors of the COVID-19 using 25(OH)D reference value in different regions.

##### Conclusions

The reference value of 25(OH)D in the Chinese elderly is related to 6 geographical factors. The ridge regression model established in this study can predict the reference value of 25(OH)D in different regions. If the latitude (°), annual temperature range (°C), annual sunshine duration (h), annual mean temperature (°C), annual mean relative humidity (%), and annual precipitation (mm) are known in a certain area. 

According to the equation:

 **Y = 56.51 - 0.25Xi - 0.0075X2 - 0.28X3 - 0.10X4 + 0.0019X5 + 0.059X6 ± 9.06** 

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/correlated-variables.jpg" alt="image" width="500"> Annual sunshine is the most important

The 25(OH)D reference value can be predicted.

Vitamin D in China has a spatial distribution differences trend of high in the south and low in the north. The elderly in the North should pay more attention to vitamin D supplements.
