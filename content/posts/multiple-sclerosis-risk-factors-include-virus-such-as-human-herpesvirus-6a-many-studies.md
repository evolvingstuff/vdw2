#### Human Herpesvirus 6A Is a Risk Factor for Multiple Sclerosis - 2022

Review Front Immunol . 2022 Feb 10;13:840753. [doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.840753.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.840753.) eCollection 2022.

The role for human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A or HHV-6B in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis has been controversial. Possibly because the damage of the virus infection may occur before onset of clinical symptoms and because it has been difficult to detect active infection and separate serological responses to HHV-6A or 6B. Recent studies report that in MS patients the serological response against HHV-6A is increased whereas it is decreased against HHV-6B. This effect seems to be even more pronounced in MS patients prior to diagnosis and supports previous studies postulating a predomination for HHV-6A in MS disease and suggests that the infection is important at early stages of the disease.

Furthermore, HHV-6A infection interacts with other factors suspected of modulating MS susceptibility and progression such as infection with 

* Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and 

* Cytomegalovirus (CMV), 

* tobacco smoking, 

* HLA alleles, 

* UV irradiation and 

* vitamin D levels. 

The multifactorial nature of MS and pathophysiological role for HHV-6A in inflammation and autoimmunity are discussed.

 **CONCLUSIONS - from PDF** 

Together, the studies compiled in this review suggest a role for HHV-6A in MS, particularly early in the disease course and/or at MS onset. This is based on findings of increased anti-HHV-6A antibody levels in people who developed MS later in life, compared to people who do not. HHV-6A infection interacts with other risk factors such as carriage of HLA-DRB1*15:01, tobacco smoking, low UV irradiation, low vitamin D levels and EBV infection; and with protective factors such carriage of the protective haplotype HLA-A*02:01 and CMV infection. This shows the multifactorial nature of MS and suggests that accumulated burden of risk factors increases the risk for acquiring the disease. We propose a pathophysiological role for HHV-6A in induction of MS where an infection of the CNS leads to a primary injury and that this in turn leads to inflammatory events and autoimmunity.

#### The role of herpesvirus 6A and 6B in multiple sclerosis and epilepsy - 2020

Scand J Immunol. 2020 Dec; 92(6): e12984 [doi: 10.1111/sji.12984](https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12984)

Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV‐6A) and 6B (HHV‐6B) are two closely related viruses that can infect cells of the central nervous system (CNS). The similarities between these viruses have made it difficult to separate them on serological level. The broad term HHV‐6 remains when referring to studies where the two species were not distinguished, and as such, the seroprevalence is over 90% in the adult population. HHV‐6B has been detected in up to 100% of infants with the primary infection roseola infantum, but less is known about the primary infection of HHV‐6A. Both viruses are neurotropic and have capacity to establish lifelong latency in cells of the central nervous system, with potential to reactivate and cause complications later in life. HHV‐6A infection has been associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas HHV‐6B is indicated to be involved in pathogenesis of epilepsy. These two associations show how neurological diseases might be caused by viral infections, but as suggested here, through completely different molecular mechanisms, in an autoimmune disease, such as MS, by triggering an overreaction of the immune system and in epilepsy by hampering internal cellular functions when the immune system fails to eliminate the virus. Understanding the viral mechanisms of primary infection and reactivation and their spectrum of associated symptoms will aid our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent these severe and chronic diseases. This review explores the role of HHV‐6A and HHV‐6B specifically in MS and epilepsy, the evidence to date and the future directions of this field.
