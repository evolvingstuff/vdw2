#### Omega-3 world map: 2024 update

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/omega-3-map-2024.webp" alt="image" width="900">

Jan Philipp Schuchardt a,b,*, Philine Beinhorn b, Xue Feng Hu c, Hing Man Chan c, Kaitlin Roke d,

Aldo Bernasconi d, Andreas Hahn b, Aleix Sala-Vila a,e, Ken D. Stark f, William S. Harris a,gIn 2016, the first worldwide n3 PUFA status map was published using the Omega-3 Index (O3I) as standard biomarker. The O3I is defined as the percentage of EPA + DHA in red blood cell (RBC) membrane FAs. The purpose of the present study was to update the 2016 map with new data. In order to be included, studies had to report O3I and/or blood EPA + DHA levels in metrics convertible into an estimated O3I, in samples drawn after 1999. To convert the non-RBC-based EPA + DHA metrics into RBC we used newly developed equations. Baseline data from clinical trials and observational studies were acceptable. A literature search identified 328 studies meeting inclusion criteria encompassing 342,864 subjects from 48 countries/regions. Weighted mean country O3I levels were categorized into very low ≤4%, low >4–6%, moderate >6–8%, and desirable >8%. We found that the O3I in most countries was low to very low.

Notable differences between the current and 2016 map were

* 1) USA, Canada, Italy, Turkey, UK, Ireland and Greece (moving from the very low to low category); 

* 2) France, Spain and New Zealand (low to moderate); and 

* 3) Finland and Iceland (moderate to desirable). 

* Countries such as Iran, Egypt, and India exhibited particularly poor O3I levels.
