* The Vitamin D Receptor can restrict how much of the Vitamin D in the blood actually gets to cells, such as bone cells.

* Resveratrol is one of 7 ways to negate the Vitamin D Receptor restrictions

* This study found that increasing Resveratrol stopped bone loss 

   * Probably by getting more Vitamin D to the bone cells

 **Opinion:  
BMD would have been improved even more if the elements known to be needed for building bones were also added:   
Vitamin D, Magnesium, Vitamin K2, Boron, Silica, Exercise**
