Background:? Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations have been associated with dementia. The association with **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)**  has not yet been explored. Our aim was to examine the association between vitamin D status and MCI status amongst older community-dwellers with subjective memory complaint.

Methods:? Ninety-five non-demented Caucasian community-dwellers with subjective memory complaint (mean, 71.1 ± 6.4 years; 54.7% women) included in the Gait and Alzheimer Interaction Tracking (GAIT) study were categorized into two groups according to Winblad et al. consensus criteria <span>[i.e., subjects with MCI or cognitively healthy individuals (CHI)]</span>.

Serum 25OHD concentration was divided into quartiles, the fourth quartile corresponding to the highest 25OHD concentration. 

The cross-sectional associations between 25OHD concentrations and MCI were modeled using logistic regressions. 

* Age, 

* gender, 

* body mass index, 

* number of comorbidities, 

* education level, 

* Mini-Mental State Examination score, 

* Frontal Assessment Battery score, 

* Geriatric Depression Scale score, 

* creatinine clearance, and

* season tested were considered as potential confounders.

Results:? Compared to CHI, patients with MCI (n = 43; mean, 71.4 ± 5.6 years; 34.9% women) had lower mean serum 25OHD concentrations (P = 0.006) and belonged more often to the lower quartiles compared to the highest quartile (P = 0.03). Increased serum 25OHD concentration was associated with a lower risk of MCI <span>[adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, P = 0.002]</span>. 

Accordingly, lower quartiles of 25OHD were positively associated with MCI whilst using the highest quartile as reference (adjusted  **OR = 25.46** , P = 0.002 for the first quartile; adjusted OR = 6.89, P = 0.03 for the second quartile; and adjusted OR = 10.29, P = 0.02 for the third quartile).

Conclusions:? Low 25OHD concentrations were associated with MCI status in older non-demented community-dwellers with subjective memory complaint.

## From the author:

The quartiles were designed as follows: first quartile between 10.0 and 40.0nmol/L, second quartile between 41.0 and 59.0nmol/L, 

third quartile between 60.0 and 79.0nmol/L, and fourth quartile between 80.0 and 189.0nmol/L.

#### Converting to units of nanograms:

* Q1: 4-16 ng/ml

* Q2: 16-24 ng/ml

* Q3: 24-32 ng/ml

* Q4: 32- 76 ng/ml

 **Thus: those with 4-16 ng vitamin D were 25X more likely to have senior moments than those with 32-76 ng**
