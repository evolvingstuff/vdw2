Introduction: Imbalances of various electrolytes, including calcium, are associated with the prognosis of Covid disease. This study investigated the relationship between serum calcium and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

Method: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Scopus, web of sciences until August 2021 using the keywords COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID, coronavirus disease, SARS-COV-infection. 2, SARS-COV-2, COVID19, calcium, calcium isotopes, calcium radioisotopes, hypercalcemia, and hypocalcemia were performed. Heterogeneity of studies was investigated using I2 index, data were analyzed using meta-analysis (random effects model) with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software software.

Results: Finally, 25 articles were included in the study. Clinical data from 12 articles showed that 59% (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 0.49-0.68) of people with COVID-19 have hypocalcemia. The results of meta-analysis showed that hypocalcemia was significantly associated with severity of the disease (p = .002), 

* mortality in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> =  **6.99** , 95% CI: 2.71-17.99), number of hospitalization days (p < .001) and

* admission to the intensive care unit (OR =  **5.09** , 95% CI: 2.14-12.10). 

The results also showed that there is a direct relationship between low serum calcium levels with increasing D-dimer levels (p = .02) and decreasing lymphocyte counts (p = .007).

Conclusion: Based on the results of meta-analysis in people with lower calcium, mortality and complications are higher, therefore, serum calcium is a prognostic factor in determining the severity of the disease. Consequently, it is suggested that serum calcium levels should be considered in initial assessments.

According to some studies, cytokines can impair the expression of calcium receptor and thus cause an imbalance in serum calcium levels.37 Numerous studies have shown that inflammatory markers, including cytokines, are higher in the serum of COVID‐19 patients than in healthy individuals.38 39

##### Perhaps COVID ==> Low Calcium

 **It appears that COVID ==> Cytokine Strom ==> Low Calcium** 

 **Note: Increased vitamin D typicall increases Calcium**

#### Hypocalcemia in COVID-19: Prevalence, clinical significance and therapeutic implications - April 2021

COVID-19 extra-pulmonary features include several endocrine manifestations and these are becoming strongly clinically relevant in patients affected influencing disease severity and outcomes. At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic no population data on calcium levels in patients affected were available and in April 2020 a first case of severe acute hypocalcemia in an Italian patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported. Subsequently, several studies reported hypocalcemia as a highly prevalent biochemical abnormality in COVID-19 patients with a marked negative influence on disease severity, biochemical inflammation and thrombotic markers, and mortality. Also a high prevalence of vertebral fractures with worse respiratory impairment in patients affected and a widespread vitamin D deficiency have been frequently observed, suggesting an emerging "Osteo-Metabolic Phenotype" in COVID-19. To date, several potential pathophysiological factors have been hypothesized to play a role in determining hypocalcemia in COVID-19 including calcium dependent viral mechanisms of action, high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in general population, chronic and acute malnutrition during critical illness and high levels of unbound and unsaturated fatty acids in inflammatory responses. Since hypocalcemia is a frequent biochemical finding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients possibly predicting worse outcomes and leading to acute cardiovascular and neurological complications if severe, it is reasonable to assess, monitor and, if indicated, replace calcium at first patient hospital evaluation and during hospitalization.
