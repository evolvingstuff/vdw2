#### COVID-XE = Omicron BA.1 recombined with Omicron BA.2

 **More infectious** 

Omicron BA.2 spreads 75% faster than BA.1

COVID-XE  appears to spread 10% faster than BA.2

 **Too early to determin relative severity** 

* "The variant was first detected in the United Kingdom in mid-January. Since then, some 600 cases of XE have been reported."

* "BA.2 is now being blamed for more than half of all COVID infections in the U.S. The hardest-hit area is the Northeast where it is blamed for more than 70% of all cases."
