!!!Impact of vitamin D supplementation on markers of inflammation in adults with cystic fibrosis hospitalized for a pulmonary exacerbation
Short Communication; European Journal of Clinical Nutrition , (18 July 2012) | doi:10.1038/ejcn.2012.82
R E Grossmann, S M Zughaier, S Liu, R H Lyles and V Tangpricha

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic lung infection and inflammation leading to respiratory failure. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with CF, and correction of vitamin D deficiency may improve innate immunity and reduce inflammation in patients with CF. We conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of high-dose vitamin D to assess the impact of vitamin D therapy on antimicrobial peptide concentrations and markers of inflammation. 

We randomized 30 adults with CF hospitalized with a pulmonary exacerbation to 250?000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo, and evaluated changes in plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers and the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 at baseline and 12 weeks post intervention. In the vitamin D group, there was a 
*50.4% reduction in tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF-?) at 12 weeks (P&amp;lt;0.01), 
*and there was a trend for a 64.5% reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P=0.09). 
There were no significant changes in 
*IL-1?, 
*IL-8, 
*IL-10, 
*IL-18BP and 
*NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin). 
We conclude that a large bolus dose of vitamin D is associated with reductions in two inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-?. 
This study supports the concept that vitamin D may help regulate inflammation in CF, and that further research is needed to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved and the impact on clinical outcomes.

Background: By modulating immune function, vitamin D might increase innate immunity and inhibit the growth of initial bacterial invasion and protect against tuberculosis infection.

Objective: We examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion.

Design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 120 Mongol schoolchildren. We estimated the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection at baseline and examined the effect of vitamin D (800 IU/d) on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and TST conversion.

Results: At baseline, the mean (±SD) 25(OH)D concentration was 7 ± 4 ng/mL, and all concentrations were &amp;lt;20 ng/mL. 
Vitamin D supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D by a mean of 12.7 ng/mL compared with placebo (P &amp;lt; 0.0001). 

At baseline, 16 children in the vitamin D group and 18 in the placebo group were TST positive (P = 0.7). 
Over 6 mo, TSTs converted to positive in 5 (11%) children receiving vitamin D compared with 11 (27%) receiving placebo (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.09; P = 0.06). 

Only one TST conversion occurred among those whose serum 25(OH)D concentration increased to &amp;gt;20 ng/mL, 
whereas 8 TST conversions occurred in those whose final 25(OH)D concentration remained &amp;lt;10 ng/mL (P = 0.05). 

The mean increase in stature was 2.9 ± 1.6 cm in the vitamin D group and 2.0 ± 1.7 cm in the placebo group (95% CI: 2.16, 2.81; P &amp;lt; 0.003).

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation for 6 mo had significant favorable effects on serum 25(OH)D concentrations and on growth in stature. 
A trend was seen toward fewer TST conversions in the vitamin D group. 

This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01244204|NCT01244204.]

27% of controls got TB, and grew 2 cm
11% of those getting 800 IU of vitamin D got TB and grew 2.9 cm
2.5X less chance of TB than controls and grew in height 50% more than controls

!Note – no mention of vitamin D in the abstract 

Found a link between lack of sleep and the development of certain diseases and conditions, such as 
*high blood pressure (hypertension), 
*diabetes and 
*obesity.

Study deprived 15 men of sleep for 27 hours. When deprived of sleep &amp;quot;The granulocytes reacted immediately to the physical stress of sleep loss and directly mirrored the body&amp;#39;s stress response.&amp;quot;

A granulocyte is a type of white blood cell that is full of microscopic granules - tiny sacs that contain enzymes for digesting microorganisms. Granulocytes form part of our innate immune system.

!!Diurnal Rhythms in Blood Cell Populations and the Effect of Acute Sleep Deprivation in Healthy Young Men

3 Centre for Chronobiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom

The sleep/wake cycle is accompanied by changes in circulating numbers of immune cells. The goal of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of diurnal rhythms in different blood cell populations and to investigate the effect of acute sleep deprivation on the immune system, as an indicator of the body&amp;#39;s acute stress response.

Setting: Home environment and Clinical Research Centre.

Participants: 15 healthy male participants aged 23.7 ± 5.4 (standard deviation) yr.

Interventions: Total sleep deprivation.

Measurements and Results:

Diurnal rhythms of several blood cell populations were assessed under a normal sleep/wake cycle followed by 29 hr of extended wakefulness. The effect of condition (sleep versus sleep deprivation) on peak time and amplitude was investigated. Interindividual variation of, and the level of correlation between, the different cell populations was assessed.

Comprehensive nonlinear curve fitting showed significant diurnal rhythms for all blood cell types investigated, with CD4 (naïve) cells exhibiting the most robust rhythms independent of condition. For those participants exhibiting significant diurnal rhythms in blood cell populations, only the amplitude of the granulocyte rhythm was significantly reduced by sleep deprivation. Granulocytes were the most diverse population, being most strongly affected by condition, and showed the lowest correlations with any other given cell type while exhibiting the largest interindividual variation in abundance.

Conclusions:
Granulocyte levels and diurnal rhythmicity are directly affected by acute sleep deprivation; these changes mirror the body&amp;#39;s immediate immune response upon exposure to stress.

!!!!Vitamin D intake in young children with acute lower respiratory infection
Karen S Leis, J Dayre McNally, Matthew R Montgomery, Koravangattu Sankaran, Chandima Karunanayake, Alan M Rosenberg
Translational Pediatrics

Objective: To determine if vitamin D intake is associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children.

Methods: The vitamin D intakes of children younger than 5 years of age admitted to hospital with either bronchiolitis or pneumonia were compared to an unmatched control group of the same age without respiratory infection. 

Caregivers of 197 children completed a questionnaire collecting information on demographic variables, ALRI risk factors and diet.

Associations of ALRI with vitamin D intake and other ALRI risk factors were determined.

Results: The mean vitamin D intake of children with ALRI was 48 IU/kg/d compared to 60 IU/kg/d in the control group.

When controlling for age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, northern residence, breastfeeding, immunizations and smoking contact, children with a vitamin D intake of less than 80 IU/kg/d were greater than 4 times more likely to have ALRI compared to children with a vitamin D intake exceeding __80 IU/kg/day (OR 4.9__, CI: 1.5, 16.4).

Conclusions: A higher vitamin D intake than currently recommended might be needed to offer protection against diseases such as ALRI. 
Increased vitamin D supplementation could have important public health consequences, as bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common reasons for hospitalization in young children.

__Very pleased to see that this study considered how much vitamin D the child was taking vs weight__
various groups, such as in [tiki-index.php?page_id=1757|Poland] recommend 100 IU/kg daily
