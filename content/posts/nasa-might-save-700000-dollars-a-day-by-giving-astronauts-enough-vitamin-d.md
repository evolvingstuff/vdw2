**[$360,000/ hour to operate Space Station](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cost-of-an-hour-of-an-ISS-astronauts-time) $720,000/working hour (assuming work & exercise = 12 hours/day)** 

[Astronauts  spend 2 hours a day exercising to prevent bone loss](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/stem-on-station/ditl_exercising)

Probably only work and exercise 12 hours a day, so only 10 hours a day of work 

Note: <a href="/posts/the-only-supplement-nasa-gives-crews-is-vitamin-d-sept-2015-2000-iu-daily-which--el-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: The only supplement NASA gives crews is vitamin D - Sept 2015 )) 2,000 IU daily, which is not enough

!!!I speculate that if astronauts got 8,000 IU of vitamin D daily that:
# Astronauts could spent 1 hour a day more actually working
**each hour of the space station crew costs $720,000
# Astronauts would be healthier – and thus less time off due to sickness
#Less DNA damage from high-energy environment
+((3X less pelvic inflammation from cancer radiation if high level of vitamin D – Feb 2015">Vitamin D reduces damage from Cancer radiation treatment by 3X</a>

I had been thinking about the value of a person's time

Then realized that an astronauts time is very costly

#### Web - in addition to Vitamin D, astronauts also need Magnesium

 **Suspect that the water recycling system on Space Station removes Magnesium**
