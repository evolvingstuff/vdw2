 **“There are some glimmers of hope though.** 

* Six of the largest school districts in the US recently decided to switch to antibiotic-free chicken in their cafeterias”

* UN Calls for End to Industrialized Farming

* . . Organic farm fields yielded 33 % more in drought years compared with chemically managed ones.

### Food labels

1.  **100% USDA Organic**  label offers excellent assurance that antibiotics have not been used at any stage of production.

* " **No antibiotics administered** " and similar labels also offer high assurance that antibiotics have not been used, especially if accompanied by a "USDA process Verified" shield.

1. " **Grass-fed** " label coupled with USDA Organic label means no antibiotics have been used, but if the "grass-fed" label appears alone, antibiotics may have been given.

1. " **American Grass-fed** " and 

> " **Food Alliance Grass-fed** " labels indicate that in addition to having been raised on grass, the animal in question received no antibiotics.

1. The following three labels: "Antibiotic-free," "No antibiotic residues," and "No antibiotic growth promotants," have not been approved by the USDA and may be misleading if not outright fraudulent.

1. "Natural" or "All-Natural" is completely meaningless and has no bearing on whether or not the animal was raised according to organic principles. "Natural" meat and poultry products can by law receive antibiotics, hormones, and genetically engineered grains, and can be raised in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs).

### Includes 3 videos - 1 on raising chickens

* . . raises about 30,000 chickens at a time, and over a six week growing period, it's considered normal for at least 1,000 of them to die.

* . . . the farmers are actually  **contractually prohibited from giving the flock access to open air and sunshine . . .**
