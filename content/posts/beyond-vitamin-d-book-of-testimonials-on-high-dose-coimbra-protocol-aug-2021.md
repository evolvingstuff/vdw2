#### BEYOND VITAMIN D: Stories of patients, family members, and doctors whose lives have been transformed by the Coimbra Protocol

 **[Amazon Kindle  Unlimited FREE](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=BEYOND+VITAMIN+D%3A+Stories+of+patients%2C&crid=7IDPIFB7SQ7C&sprefix=beyond+vitamin+d+stories+of+patients%2C%2Caps%2C856&ref=nb_sb_noss), $10 otherwise** Email from author **I would like to bring to your attention that my book "Beyond Vitamin D", which was released in Brazil in January 2021, has received an English version. 

My work has the special participation of Dr. Cicero Galli Coimbra, and contains 47 testimonials from doctors and patients who benefited from the treatment with therapeutic doses of vitamin D.

I have been a patient of the Coimbra Protocol for eight years, and I would be grateful if I could count on your support in disseminating this work.** Press Release **More than a book about health, this first volume in the series “Beyond Vitamin D” tells stories of patients, their families, doctors, and doctors who are also patients of the treatment that restores quality of life to patients with numerous diseases considered incurable.

While it informs the reader throughout 47 stories involving 27 pathologies, in addition to a technical text on autism and the content of the preface, this work also touches the reader's heart, recounting the suffering experienced by people who reached the point of losing all hope but then regained their quality of life and joy.

These are life testimonials covering cases of multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and autism, among others; they are reports that also show how the doctors involved changed their view of medicine.

The preface to this work was written by the creator of what is now called the Coimbra Protocol, Prof. Dr. Cicero Galli Coimbra, physician, scientist, Ph.D. in neurology, director of the Laboratory of Neuropathology and Neuroprotection at the Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp), Associate Professor at the same institution, and one of the world's leading experts in vitamin D.

Leda Al Debes, the author of the book, is a businesswoman, who was born a few days after her parents' arrival in Brazil, fleeing the war in Lebanon, and is a** carrier of no less than five autoimmune diseases__. Her feeling of gratitude for having found in the Coimbra Protocol the remission of all these pathologies motivated her to create this book with the objective of making everyone aware of the possibility of going through a simple and effective treatment, in addition to being much more accessible than the conventional ones.

The author has been a patient of the Coimbra Protocol for eight years. She voluntarily manages several channels on social networks, since 2012, in which she publicizes the treatment with vitamin D and the importance of correcting the deficiency of this substance, which is essential for everyone's health

##### Snips from the book

* "Leda has helped diffuse the fundamental part of the immediate optimization of “vitamin” D levels in the prevention and treatment of covid-19: many lives have already been saved and many incapacitating after effects avoided. If this treatment has benefited so many people today, it is because of the effort of those that, like her, understood the importance of this extraordinary substance to health and weren’t content with keeping these benefits solely for themselves. To all the people who had the courage to diffuse this knowledge, my sincere gratitude and reverence" Coimbra

* "As a doctor, one cannot let themself stop correcting any biological parameter (be it a vitamin, hormone, or anything else) not to incur negligence. In this sense, it is astounding seeing that the internationally recommended daily doses — even after being increased from 200 IU to 600 IU per day, in 2010, by the Institute of Medicine — barely, if at all, changed the serum level of this hormone. These recommendations go against publications from 2003 that already demonstrated that even double this daily dosage would never make the population (which has been progressively being deprived of the only natural source of hormone D — exposure to sunlight — since the 1980s) achieve the minimum required serum levels recommended in the US by the Endocrine Society (a minimum of 40ng/mL). It is sad verifying the reference of normality in Brazil at the start of 2018 to “above 20ng/mL,,,"
