#### Warning by VitaminDWiki

 **Some chemotherapies are potentiated by Vitamin D so much that the patient dies if the Chemo drug dose is not reduced if the white blood cell count drops near zero. I friend on mine died when his chemo doctor failed to reduce the dose as was recommended.** 

A 2010 study found that: Calcitriol potentiates cisplatin, carboplatin and  **<span style="color:#F00;">doxorubicin</span>** ; antimetabolites 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, hydroxyurea, cytarabine and gemcitabine; and microtubule-disturbing agents  **<span style="color:#F00;">paclitaxel</span>**  and docetaxel.  The 2010 study is in the following link.
