The demand for analysis of 25-hydroxyvitamin D has increased dramatically throughout the world over the past decade. As a consequence, a number of new automated assays have been introduced for 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement. Automated assays have shown variable ability to meet the technical challenges associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement. Assays are able to meet performance goals for precision at high concentrations but fail to do so at low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The overall accuracy of automated methods has improved over recent years and generally shows good overall agreement with reference methods; however, discrepancies persist for individual samples. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is used by some routine laboratories for 25-hydroxyvitamin D analysis but its widespread use is hampered by limited sample throughput. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D is an important analyte in specific clinical situations, which remains in the hands of specialised laboratories using manual analytical methods.
