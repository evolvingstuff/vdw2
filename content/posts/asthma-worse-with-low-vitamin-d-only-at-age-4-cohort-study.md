Background:? Research suggests an influence of micronutrients on childhood asthma. So far, evidence mainly originates from cross-sectional studies using nutrient intake data, which is not an accurate measure of nutrient status. This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and prospective associations between serum concentrations of magnesium, vitamin D, selenium, and zinc and prevalence of (severe) asthma, atopy, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in childhood. 

Methods:? In the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy birth cohort study, serum nutrient concentrations were available for a 4-yr-old subgroup (n?=?372) and for a different 8-yr-old subgroup (n?=?328). Yearly questionnaires inquired about asthma prevalence until 8?yr of age. Allergic sensitization was measured at 4 and 8?yr of age; BHR was measured at 8?yr of age. Data were analyzed with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations models. 

Results:? There was a consistent ( **non-significant** ) inverse association between serum magnesium concentrations and asthma prevalence. Serum vitamin D concentrations measured at age 4 were inversely associated with asthma at ages 4-8 <span>[e.g., cross-sectional association between vitamin D tertile 3 vs. 1 and severe asthma: odds ratio (OR): 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25-0.95]</span>, whereas vitamin D measured at age 8 was positively associated with asthma at age 8 (e.g., cross-sectional association between vitamin D tertile 3 vs. 1 and severe asthma: OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 0.67-6.82). 

Conclusions:? Our study contributes to the evidence that children with higher serum magnesium concentrations are less likely to have asthma.  **The associations between serum vitamin D concentrations and asthma were age-dependent.**

### Strange

Age 4  asthma worse if low vitamin D

Age 8  asthma worse if high vitamin D
