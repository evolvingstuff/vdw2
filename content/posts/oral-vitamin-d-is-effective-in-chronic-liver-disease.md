BACKGROUND & AIMS: End-stage chronic liver disease is associated with vitamin D deficiency but the prevalence across a broad-spectrum of liver disease is unknown. 

This study prospectively examines prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and response to replacement in chronic liver disease.

METHODS: One hundred and fifty-eight outpatients with chronic liver disease were enrolled. 

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were classified as: 

* severely deficient less than 25nmol/l, deficient 25-54nmol/l or 

* replete greater than 54nmol/l. 

Sixty-five of 158 (41%) had cirrhosis.

RESULTS: 25<span>[OH]</span>D was suboptimal in 101/158 (64%), including severe deficiency in 24 patients (15%). 

Vitamin D deficiency occurred in liver disease of all aetiologies, including patients with only mild liver disease. 25<span>[OH]</span>D increased by 60.0% (19.11+/-13.20nmol/l) in patients with deficiency after vitamin D replacement and decreased by 25.2% (-18.33+/-12.02nmol/l) in non-treated initially replete patients over a median of 4 months.

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency improves with oral vitamin D supplementation and levels fall without supplementation. 

Chronic liver disease patients are at very high risk of vitamin D deficiency regardless of etiology or severity. PMID: 20801590
