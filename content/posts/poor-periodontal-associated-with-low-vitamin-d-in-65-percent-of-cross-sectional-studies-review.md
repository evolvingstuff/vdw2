#### Personal note by founder of VitaminDWiki

 **I have been whitening my teeth with a mixture of powders which I make up:   
<span style="color:#00F;">Vitamin D + Charcole + Bentonite Clay</span>.   
Seems to help both my teeth and gums.   
 Last year I had experimented with making a Vitamin D mouthwash as a quick way of getting Vitamin D into my body.**

Objective

To evaluate the existing evidence supporting or refuting the following questions: 

* (i) Do patients with lower vitamin D levels have higher risk for periodontal disease? 

* (ii) Are periodontal treatment outcomes improved by the adjuvant supplementation of vitamin D or by elevated serum vitamin D levels?

Material and Methods

MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched up to September 2017. Studies were included if they had measured serum vitamin D levels or vitamin D intake and any periodontal parameter.

Results

Overall, 27 studies were included (

*  **13 cross-sectional studies** , 

* 6 case-control studies, 

* 5 cohort studies, 

* 2 randomized clinical trials and 

* 1 case series study). 

 **Sixty-five percent of the cross-sectional studies**  reported significant associations between low vitamin D levels and poor periodontal parameters. 

None of the observational longitudinal studies found that periodontal disease progression could be attributed to lower vitamin D levels. 

No interventional studies that evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation as a solely adjuvant to periodontal treatment was found. 

No meta-analysis was performed due to high variability across studies.

Conclusion

The data to support or refute the association between vitamin D levels and periodontal disease are inconclusive at the moment. More rigorously designed longitudinal studies with standardized definitions of periodontal disease and vitamin D are necessary.
