#### Interview and Upcoming Presentation with Dr. Richard Cheng, an Anti-aging and Integrative Cancer Therapy Physician

 **[GrassrootsHealth](https://is.gd/cheng2023)** 

* According to Dr. Cheng, “If you don’t supplement with vitamin D, you’re deficient… period.

* Richard Cheng, MD, PhD, is a board-certified anti-aging and integrative cancer therapy physician with offices in the United States and Shanghai.

* "Dr. Cheng began integrating nutrition into his practice ~30 years ago, starting with vitamin C supplementation. Around 20 years ago, he started incorporating more supplements, especially vitamin D. He would  **often recommend 5,000 IU/day of vitamin D**  to his fellow doctors; however, many would respond to say 5,000 IU was too much, and that they were worried about taking that much or recommending that amount to their patients."

* "His protocol involves more than just vitamin D, although it’s one of the top 3 nutrients he ALWAYS recommends, along with a healthy low carb diet. Vitamin C and magnesium are the other two supplements that he always suggests"

* Dr. Cheng has been taking 30,000 IU per day himself

  * Note: The founder of VitaminDWiki takes an average of 25,000 IU daily

* "Great news from Dr. Cheng – he has been able to help reverse or significantly improve many chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease (as shown by angiogram – working on a paper now). Vitamin D is a major part of this protocol. He has also helped to reverse several autoimmune diseases (including Hashimoto’s, psoriasis, vitiligo, SLE, ulcerative colitis, eczema); ..."

* "Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, therefore if it is taken as one big dose, much of it will be excreted. The body is able to absorb close to 1g of vitamin C every hour. To take it, you can either put it in water and drink it throughout the day or divide the larger dose into 3 smaller doses taken at different times of the day."

!!!!Interview and Upcoming Presentation with Dr. Richard Cheng, an Anti-aging and Integrative Cancer Therapy Physician
__[https://is.gd/cheng2023|GrassrootsHealth]__
*According to Dr. Cheng, “If you don’t supplement with vitamin D, you’re deficient… period.
*Richard Cheng, MD, PhD, is a board-certified anti-aging and integrative cancer therapy physician with offices in the United States and Shanghai.
*&quot;Dr. Cheng began integrating nutrition into his practice ~30 years ago, starting with vitamin C supplementation. Around 20 years ago, he started incorporating more supplements, especially vitamin D. He would __often recommend 5,000 IU/day of vitamin D__ to his fellow doctors; however, many would respond to say 5,000 IU was too much, and that they were worried about taking that much or recommending that amount to their patients.&quot;
*&quot;His protocol involves more than just vitamin D, although it’s one of the top 3 nutrients he ALWAYS recommends, along with a healthy low carb diet. Vitamin C and magnesium are the other two supplements that he always suggests&quot;
