Vitamin D is one significant prohormone substance in human organ systems. It is a steroidal hormone produced in the skin upon exposure to UVB rays. This paper presents a systematic review of the utilization of topical vitamin D, specifically cholecalciferol, calcipotriol, and tacalcitol, in the treatment of vitiligo. It considers the role of vitamin D in stimulating the synthesis of melanin and melanogenesis, which can help with the process of repigmentation. The inclusion of calcipotriol or tacalcitol in Narrowband Ultraviolet Phototherapy (NB-UVB) has shown the potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes for vitiligo. However, their effectiveness in combination with Psoralens Long Wave Ultraviolet Radiation (PUVA) and Monochromatic Excimer Light (MEL) treatment for vitiligo is limited. In contrast, combining topical corticosteroids with vitamin D analogues has demonstrated superior efficacy in treating vitiligo compared to using vitamin D analogues alone, while also providing the added benefit of reducing corticosteroid-related adverse effects. In addition, treating stable vitiligo with topical cholecalciferol and microneedling has shown success. Future studies are needed to ascertain an efficient method of administering vitamin D topically as an anti-vitiligo agent.
