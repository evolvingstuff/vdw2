To investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy on the offspring's cognitive function in mice with advanced maternal age (AMA). Thirty-two-week-old female mice were randomly allocated into two groups: the 32 W+VD group (receiving 10 IU/g body weight vitamin D3 dissolved in 200 μl corn oil per day), and the 32 W group (receiving 200 μl corn oil per day) for one week before mating with ten-week-old male mice. Another group of eight-week-old female mice was given 200 μl corn oil for the same period of time and set as normal childbearing age controls (8 W group). The pregnancy outcomes were recorded and the offspring at the age of 6 weeks were subjected to behavioral tests. Finally, the expression level and distribution of neural cell markers in the offspring's hippocampus were detected by immunofluorescence. 

* Mice with AMA had higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, smaller litter size, and offspring development. 

   * Vitamin D supplementation in mice with AMA promoted offspring development. 

AMA and maternal vitamin D supplementation  **before pregnancy**  did not change the anxiety and depression of young adult offspring. 

* AMA impaired spatial learning and memory function of offspring 

   * while vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy rescued the impairment. 

* AMA decreased NEFH (neurofilament protein) and MAP2 (microtubule binding protein) expression in offspring hippocampus, 

   * but vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy promoted NEFH and MAP2. 

* Vitamin D supplementation before pregnancy can rescue the impaired learning and memory in offspring born to AMA mice. 

Our results highlight the significant impact of maternal vitamin D supplementation on the cognitive function of offspring.
