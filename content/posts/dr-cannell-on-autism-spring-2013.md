## Note: Response to question #30

Accidentally 3 mothers gave 3 dropper fulls instead of 3 drops worth of vitamin D to their austistic children

He did not say, but a typical standard is 2,000 IU in a drop, so the children got  **60,000 IU per day** 

There was a rapid recovery in all three cases.

Dr. Cannell speculated that the future goal for Autism might be a vitamin D level of 150 ng instead of the current 50-80 ng level

### Autism, will vitamin D treat core symptoms?

Med Hypotheses. 2013 May 29. pii: S0306-9877(13)00233-8. [doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.05.004.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2013.05.004.)

No medication exists to treat the core symptoms of autism. However, some children spontaneously improve and have optimal outcomes. Parents of autistic children who have access to swimming pool have reported summertime improvement in symptoms to me. A Japanese case report found the same summer times improvements. If the cause of that summertime improvement could be identified, it may lead to effective treatment. Vitamin D is highly seasonal with a summertime surfeit and a wintertime deficit. The hypotheses that the increased prevalence in the diagnosis of autism is due to better detection imply that parents, teachers and physicians of the 1950s, 60s, and 70s missed this non subtle diagnosis, an unlikely scenario. Recent research indicates that autism often first present itself during the second and third year of life. This is a time when most toddlers have no known sources of vitamin D. Vitamin D has remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-autoimmune properties. In vitro, in vivo, and animal experiments provide compelling data for vitamin D's role brain proliferation, differentiation, neurotrophism, neuroprotection, neurotransmission, and neuroplasticity. It also upregulates glutathione, upregulates a suit of genes involved in DNA repair and raises the seizure threshold. Adequate, perhaps pharmacological, doses of vitamin D may have a treatment effect in the core symptoms of autism.
