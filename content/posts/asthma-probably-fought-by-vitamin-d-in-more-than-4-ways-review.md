Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease that affects millions of people worldwide, and its prevalence continues to increase. Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential environmental factor in asthma pathogenesis, due to its immunomodulatory effects. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in order to prevent airway remodeling in asthmatic patients. Four electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Clinical trails.gov, and CINAHL, were thoroughly searched to conduct a comprehensive literature review. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023413798) contains a record of the registered protocol. We identified 9447 studies during the initial search; 9 studies (0.1%) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. 

All included studies were experimental studies that investigated the impact of vitamin D supplementation on airway remodeling in asthma. 

The studies included in this review suggest that vitamin D 

1. inhibits airway smooth muscle cell contraction and remodeling, 

1. reduces inflammation, 

1. regulates collagen synthesis in the airways, and 

1. modulates the action of bronchial fibroblasts. 

However, one study suggests that TGF-Î²1 can impair vitamin D-induced and constitutive airway epithelial host defense mechanisms. Overall, vitamin D appears to have a potential role in the prevention and management of asthma.
