#### Association Between Vitamin D Level and Clinical Outcomes of Assisted Reproductive Treatment: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis

Reprod Sci . 2024 May 22. [doi: 10.1007/s43032-024-01578-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-024-01578-9)

The investigation about association between vitamin D level and clinical outcomes of assisted reproductive treatment showed various outcomes. This study aimed to review the correlation between vitamin D and outcomes of assisted reproductive treatment. The search was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023458040). PubMed, Embase, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched up to July 2023. Twenty-three observational studies were selected for meta-analysis.

Comparing groups with deficient and 'insufficient + sufficient' vitamin D level, meta-analysis showed positive correlation between clinical pregnancy rate and vitamin D (OR 0.81, 95%CI: 0.70, 0.95, P = 0.0001).

Comparing groups with 'deficient + insufficient' and sufficient vitamin D level, meta-analysis showed positive correlation between vitamin D and clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.55, 0.91, P = 0.006), vitamin D and live birth rate (OR 0.69, 95%CI: 0.54, 0.89, P = 0.003). 

Subgroup analysis did not show the source of high heterogeneity. 

No correlation was found in biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and implantation rate. In dose-response meta-analysis, a nonlinear association was found between vitamin D levels and outcomes when levels are  **below approximately 24 ng/L** . The study shows that vitamin D level is associated with clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate. Low vitamin D level does not influence biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and implantation rate. 

Furthermore, 24 ng/L may be a possible threshold of vitamin D concentration in assisted reproduction therapy.
