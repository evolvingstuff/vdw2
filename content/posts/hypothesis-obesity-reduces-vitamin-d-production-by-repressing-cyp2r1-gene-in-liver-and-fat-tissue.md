* For years it had been believed that obese people store vitamin D in fatty tissue.

* This study found that surgically removing fatty tissue in humans increases the activation of the CYP2R1 gene, which results in semi-activation of more Vitamin D

   * This could be the reason that more vitamin D appears to increase after weight loss, rather than the theory that fatty tissue stores the Vitamin D

* But, fat surgery also decreases the amount of semi-activated VItamin D in the blood which is activated (CYP27B1)
