#### Recommended Summer Sunlight Exposure Levels Can Produce Sufficient (greater than or equal to 20 ng ml−1) but Not the Proposed Optimal (greater than or equal to 32 ng ml−1) 25(OH)D Levels at UK Latitudes

Recommendations on limitation of summer sunlight exposure to prevent skin cancer may conflict with requirements to protect bone health through adequate vitamin D levels, the principal source being UVB in summer sunlight. We determined whether sufficient (greater than or equal to 20 ng ml−1) and proposed optimal (greater than or equal to 32 ng ml−1) 25(OH)D levels are attained by following UK guidance advising casual short exposures to UVB in summer sunlight, and performed the study under known conditions to enhance the specificity of future recommendations. 

 **During wintertime** , when ambient UVB is negligible, 120 white Caucasians, aged 20–60 years, from Greater Manchester, UK (53.5°N) received a simulated summer's sunlight exposures, specifically 1.3 standard erythemal dose, three times weekly for 6 weeks, while wearing T-shirt and shorts. 

The baseline winter data predict that 5% (confidence interval (CI): 2.7–8.6) of Greater Manchester white Caucasians have deficient (<5 ng ml−1) 25(OH)D, 62.5% (CI: 55.2–69.4) have insufficient, and only 2.9% (CI: 1.4–5.6) have proposed optimal levels. After the simulated summer exposures, 90 (CI: 84.9–93.7) and 26.2% (CI: 20.1–33.2) reached 20 and 32 ng ml−1 25(OH)D, respectively. Assuming midday UVB levels, sufficient but suboptimal vitamin D status is attained after a summer's short (13 minutes) sunlight exposures to 35% skin surface area; these findings will assist future public health guidance on vitamin D acquisition.

Need more UV time for 20+ reasons - such as dark skin, obese, senior, more clothes, standing up, etc.

 **35% of whole body?** 

They used a whole body irradiation cabinet with people clothed with t-shirt and shorts

Wonder if they noticed that a person lying down only has 1/2 of the body exposed to the sun?
