#### Updated Meta-analysis Reveals Limited Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Chronic Low Back Pain

In Vivo. 2024 Nov-Dec;38(6):2955-2967. [doi: 10.21873/invivo.13778](https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.13778)

Background/aim: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) significantly reduces quality of life and increases reliance on healthcare resources. Despite many individuals opting for vitamin D supplementation to alleviate CLBP, its efficacy remains debatable. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in treating this condition.

Patients and methods: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in adults with CLBP, focusing exclusively on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to May 2024 across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science.

Results: Ten RCTs meeting our inclusion criteria were analyzed. The results indicated that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce pain scores compared to control groups (SMD: -0.130, 95%CI=-0.260 to 0.000; I2=0%), regardless of participants' baseline vitamin D levels. Moreover, long-term supplementation showed no notable improvement in CLBP outcomes (SMD: -0.097, 95%CI=-0.290 to -0.097; I2=19.878%). Additionally, supplementation with active forms of vitamin D (SMD: -0.321, 95%CI=-0.670 to 0.028; I2=0.000%) did not result in significant pain relief for chronic lower back pain.

Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation does not substantially alleviate CLBP. Nevertheless, it may still be considered as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Further research is necessary to explore its long-term effects and the underlying mechanisms that may explain the observed lack of benefit.
