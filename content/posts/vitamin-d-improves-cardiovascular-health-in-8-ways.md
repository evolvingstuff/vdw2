Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a widespread global health issue, affecting nearly a billion individuals worldwide, and mounting evidence links it to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure. The discovery of vitamin D receptors and metabolizing enzymes in cardiac and vascular cells, coupled with experimental studies, underscores the complex relationship between vitamin D and cardiovascular health. This review aims to synthesize and critically evaluate the preclinical evidence elucidating the role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health. We examined diverse preclinical in vitro (cardiomyocyte cell line) models and in vivo models, including knockout mice, diet-induced deficiency, and disease-specific animal models (hypertension, hypertrophy and myocardial infarction). These studies reveal that vitamin D modulates vascular tone, and prevents fibrosis and hypertrophy through effects on major signal transduction pathways (NF-kB, Nrf2, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Calcineurin/NFAT, TGF-Î²/Smad, AMPK) and influences epigenetic mechanisms governing inflammation, oxidative stress, and pathological remodeling. In vitro studies elucidate vitamin D's capacity to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation and inhibit pathological remodeling. In vivo studies further uncovered detrimental cardiac effects of VDD, while supplementation with vitamin D in cardiovascular disease (CVD) models demonstrated its protective effects by decreasing inflammation, attenuating hypertrophy, reduction in plaque formation, and improving cardiac function. Hence, this comprehensive review emphasizes the critical role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health and its potential as a preventive/therapeutic strategy in CVDs. However, further research is needed to translate these findings into clinical applications as there are discrepancies between preclinical and clinical studies.
