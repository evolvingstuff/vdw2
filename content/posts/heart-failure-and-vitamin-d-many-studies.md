 **Heart failure is a long-term condition that occurs when the heart's pumping becomes less effective, causing blood to back up in other parts of the body. It's usually caused by another health problem, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), high blood pressure, or heart attack. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can develop quickly or gradually over time**

#### The different types of heart failure - [Perplexity AI Aug 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-describe-the-different-H7jfUfiSQ7qwvwMXnY6SAQ)

Heart failure is a complex condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs. It can be classified in several ways based on the affected side of the heart, the heart's pumping ability, and the progression of the condition. Here are the main types of heart failure:

##### Types of Heart Failure

 **** Left-Sided Heart Failure **** 

*  **Systolic Heart Failure (HFrEF):**  This occurs when the left ventricle loses its ability to contract normally, resulting in a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less. The heart cannot pump with enough force to push blood into circulation.

*  **Diastolic Heart Failure (HFpEF):**  In this type, the left ventricle becomes stiff and loses its ability to relax and fill properly during the resting period between beats. The ejection fraction is preserved at 50% or more.

 **** Right-Sided Heart Failure **** 

* This type usually results from left-sided failure, where increased fluid pressure is transferred back through the lungs, damaging the right side of the heart. It leads to blood backing up in the veins, causing swelling in the legs, ankles, and abdomen.

 **** Biventricular Heart Failure **** 

* This occurs when both sides of the heart are affected, leading to symptoms of both left-sided and right-sided heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fluid buildup.

 **** Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) **** 

* Often used interchangeably with heart failure, CHF emphasizes the congestion due to blood flow backup, leading to fluid retention and swelling in the body, particularly in the lungs and extremities.

##### Classification by Progression

 **** Acute vs. Chronic Heart Failure **** 

*  **Acute Heart Failure:**  Develops suddenly and is often a medical emergency. Symptoms are severe but can improve rapidly with treatment.

*  **Chronic Heart Failure:**  Develops gradually and symptoms worsen over time. It requires long-term management.

##### Classification by Pumping Ability

*  **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF):**  The heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump enough blood.

*  **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF):**  The heart muscle is stiff and cannot fill with enough blood, despite normal contraction strength.

Understanding the type and classification of heart failure is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and management strategies. Each type has distinct characteristics and may require different therapeutic approaches.

{FONT(size=&quot;18&quot;)}__Heart failure is a long-term condition that occurs when the heart&#39;s pumping becomes less effective, causing blood to back up in other parts of the body. It&#39;s usually caused by another health problem, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), high blood pressure, or heart attack. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can develop quickly or gradually over time__{FONT}

!!!!The different types of heart failure - [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-describe-the-different-H7jfUfiSQ7qwvwMXnY6SAQ|Perplexity AI Aug 2024]
Heart failure is a complex condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to meet the body&#39;s needs. It can be classified in several ways based on the affected side of the heart, the heart&#39;s pumping ability, and the progression of the condition. Here are the main types of heart failure:
!!!!!Types of Heart Failure
____Left-Sided Heart Failure____
*__Systolic Heart Failure (HFrEF):__ This occurs when the left ventricle loses its ability to contract normally, resulting in a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 40% or less. The heart cannot pump with enough force to push blood into circulation.
*__Diastolic Heart Failure (HFpEF):__ In this type, the left ventricle becomes stiff and loses its ability to relax and fill properly during the resting period between beats. The ejection fraction is preserved at 50% or more.
____Right-Sided Heart Failure____
*This type usually results from left-sided failure, where increased fluid pressure is transferred back through the lungs, damaging the right side of the heart. It leads to blood backing up in the veins, causing swelling in the legs, ankles, and abdomen.
____Biventricular Heart Failure____
*This occurs when both sides of the heart are affected, leading to symptoms of both left-sided and right-sided heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fluid buildup.
____Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)____
*Often used interchangeably with heart failure, CHF emphasizes the congestion due to blood flow backup, leading to fluid retention and swelling in the body, particularly in the lungs and extremities.
!!!!!Classification by Progression
____Acute vs. Chronic Heart Failure____
*__Acute Heart Failure:__ Develops suddenly and is often a medical emergency. Symptoms are severe but can improve rapidly with treatment.
*__Chronic Heart Failure:__ Develops gradually and symptoms worsen over time. It requires long-term management.
!!!!!Classification by Pumping Ability
*__Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF):__ The heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump enough blood.
*__Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF):__ The heart muscle is stiff and cannot fill with enough blood, despite normal contraction strength.
Understanding the type and classification of heart failure is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment and management strategies. Each type has distinct characteristics and may require different therapeutic approaches.
