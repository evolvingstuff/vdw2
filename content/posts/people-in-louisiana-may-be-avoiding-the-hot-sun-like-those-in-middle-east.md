Vitamin D is critical in bone and mineral homeostasis, particularly in the prevention of rickets in children. Levels of vitamin D in cord blood were measured in a population from New Orleans as an index of maternal vitamin D status at the time of delivery. Cord blood samples from infants born during the summer and winter showed lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared with those from infants born during fall and spring, indicating an unusual pattern of seasonality where  **vitamin D levels were among the lowest in the season with the greatest sunlight** . It is important to establish screening and supplementation guidelines based on observed regional trends and risk factors, in addition to considerations based on global recommendations.
