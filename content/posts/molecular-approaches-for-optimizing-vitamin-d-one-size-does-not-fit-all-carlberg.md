#### Molecular Approaches for Optimizing Vitamin D Supplementation

Vitamins & Hormones, online 30 November 2015

 **VitaminDWiki quick-read comment on the study** 

Genes are responsible for much of the individual variation in response to vitamin D. 

Author introduces a concept of a  **vitamin D Index**  which could be made based on before/after measurements of vitamin D levels along with before/after DNA analysis of 4 – 20 genes (to measure affect of Vitamin D intervention).

If a loading dose is used the vitamin D tests could be closely spaced (a few days to a week or so). 

 **Quotes from the PDF** 

* VitDmet (NCT01479933 small study of mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM)    Carlberg et al., 2013

> “study subjects differed significantly by responding only to 29% to 83% of all. This allowed a segregation of the study subjects into high and low responders”

* VitDbol (NCT02063334 – 2,000 IU  reported in Vukic et al., 2015

* “each human individual displays a personal response to vitamin D”

* “it is advisable to measure at least twice a person’s vitamin D status together with a number of molecular and clinical parameter”

* “The response to vitamin D supplementation varies considerably from individual to individual and depends on many factors, such as baseline level, adiposity, and genotype, i.e., a  **“one dose fits all” approach is not anymore appropriate** ”

 **What appears to be missing in the study** 

* No numbers from the study about how big the factors actually are

* No indication of influence of Vitamin D Receptor inside cells – which is not measured by ANY vitamin D test

* No mention of importance of cofactors (Magnesium, Omega-3, etc) on the vitamin D response

* No indication of  response variation from alternate sources of vitamin D (topical, gut friendly, active vitamin D, etc)

* No indication of affects of genes not in the blood – e.g. prostrate, skin, breast, etc.
