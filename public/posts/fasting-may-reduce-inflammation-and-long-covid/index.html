<p>&ldquo;Numerous doctors treating long COVID and COVID vaccine injuries now suggest fasting as a potential therapy for overall symptom improvement. However, this therapeutic approach may also benefit individuals without these specific ailments.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Medical applications of fasting date back to at least the 5th century B.C. Hippocrates, a revered figure in modern medicine, advocated against eating while ill, stating that “to eat when you are sick, is to feed your illness.” &quot;</p>

<li>
<p>&ldquo;Consuming food generally triggers inflammation, while fasting promotes an anti-inflammatory response. &quot;</p>

Notably, a study published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(14)00151-9">Cell Stem Cell</a> found that a three-day fasting period can reset the immune system by degrading old immune cells and regenerating new ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;FLCCC doctors believe that spike proteins, whether from the infection or the vaccine, play a significant role in patients’ symptoms. These spike proteins can lead to inflammation, microclotting, mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmunity, neurological issues, and other complications.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Chaperone-mediated autophagy, which specializes in protein degradation, typically activates after 24 hours of fasting. Therefore, the FLCCC recommends prolonged fasting of 72 hours or more if tolerated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Intermittent fasting has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470960/">potential benefits</a> for cognitive function and memory, with <a href="https://ginnycutler.medium.com/finding-clarity-series-4-how-the-5-days-water-fast-supercharges-body-mind-and-everyday-clarity-f51b68621de">some people reporting</a> improved mental clarity and memory from intermittent fasting or while fasting for prolonged periods. Studies show fasting [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009130222100073X#:<del>:text=Expression of the brain-derived,, and learning [16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009130222100073X#:</del>:text=Expression of the brain-derived,, and learning [16).|increases the brain-derived neurotrophic factor].

<h4 id="asked-gpt-4-what-is-autophagy">Asked GPT-4: What is autophagy?</h4>
<p>Autophagy is a cellular process by which the cells recycle their own components to provide the necessary building blocks for maintaining cellular functions and adapting to changing conditions. The term &ldquo;autophagy&rdquo; comes from the Greek words for &ldquo;self&rdquo; (auto) and &ldquo;eating&rdquo; (phagy), literally meaning &ldquo;self-eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a cell undergoes autophagy, it encloses some of its own components—like damaged proteins or organelles—in a double-membrane vesicle known as an autophagosome. This autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome, an organelle that contains enzymes capable of breaking down biological molecules. The contents of the autophagosome are degraded within the lysosome and released back into the cell to be reused.</p>
<p>Autophagy serves many functions in the body. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quality control: Autophagy helps to remove damaged proteins and organelles, which could otherwise harm the cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy management: During times of nutrient scarcity, autophagy allows cells to recycle their own components to supply essential metabolic substrates, effectively helping the cell to survive under starvation conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development and differentiation: Autophagy can modulate the levels of various proteins, influencing the processes of cellular development and differentiation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immune response: By degrading intracellular pathogens and presenting antigens to the immune system, autophagy contributes to the body&rsquo;s immune responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disease prevention: Impaired autophagy has been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Autophagy is a vital process for the survival, growth, differentiation, and homeostasis of cells, and it has increasingly been the focus of biomedical research. In 2016, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy.</p>

My water fast is really a water + usual supplements fast

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Includes Magnesium Chloride &amp; D-Ribose in water, Vitamin D, Vitamin K, Boron, Omega-3 etc.

Zero hunger, headaches and have high energy, and perhaps even better cognition while on the fast

Strangely,I had little weight loss DURING subsequent fasts, but lost 2-3 lbs AFTER each fast

Have lost and am keeping off 10 lbs after 3 fasts

As of June 2023. I am going on one 3-day water/vitamin D fast about once a month

Have seen no literature to support these &quot;D-Fast&quot; observations

I personally had tried intermittent fasting for several years - with no long-term weight loss

!!!!Fasting: A Game Changer for Spike Protein Injuries, Potentially Combats Alzheimer’s and Cancer
__[https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fasting-a-game-changer-for-spike-protein-injuries-potentially-combats-alzheimers-and-cancer_5313557.html?utm_source=prtnrhard&amp;utm_campaign=vigilantf&amp;src_src=prtnrhard&amp;src_cmp=vigilantf&amp;utm_medium=email|Epoch times]__
*&quot;Numerous doctors treating long COVID and COVID vaccine injuries now suggest fasting as a potential therapy for overall symptom improvement. However, this therapeutic approach may also benefit individuals without these specific ailments.&quot;
*&quot;Medical applications of fasting date back to at least the 5th century B.C. Hippocrates, a revered figure in modern medicine, advocated against eating while ill, stating that “to eat when you are sick, is to feed your illness.” &quot;
*&quot;Consuming food generally triggers inflammation, while fasting promotes an anti-inflammatory response. &quot;

*&quot;FLCCC doctors believe that spike proteins, whether from the infection or the vaccine, play a significant role in patients’ symptoms. These spike proteins can lead to inflammation, microclotting, mitochondrial dysfunction, autoimmunity, neurological issues, and other complications.&quot;

!!!!VitaminDWiki Founder really likes 3-day fasts (boosted by vitamin D)
For many decades I was unsuccessful at fasting for more than a day
~hs~~hs~ I would get very hungry, have headaches, and be low on energy after a single day
~hs~~hs~ Any weight lost would be &quot;found&quot; within a week
A person told me of great success with 3-day fasts that started with a large dose of vitamin D
I start (within 10 hr of last meal) my fast with 50,000 IU of nanoemulsion vitamin D (acts in &lt; 2 hours)
~hs~~hs~ Suspect a person should take 50,000 IU of normal vitamin D 2-3 days before starting a fast
My water fast is really a water + usual supplements fast
~hs~~hs~Includes Magnesium Chloride &amp; D-Ribose in water, Vitamin D, Vitamin K, Boron, Omega-3 etc.
Zero hunger, headaches and have high energy, and perhaps even better cognition while on the fast
Strangely,I had little weight loss DURING subsequent fasts, but lost 2-3 lbs AFTER each fast
Have lost and am keeping off 10 lbs after 3 fasts
As of June 2023. I am going on one 3-day water/vitamin D fast about once a month
Have seen no literature to support these &quot;D-Fast&quot; observations
I personally had tried intermittent fasting for several years - with no long-term weight loss

!!!!Asked GPT-4: What is autophagy?
Autophagy is a cellular process by which the cells recycle their own components to provide the necessary building blocks for maintaining cellular functions and adapting to changing conditions. The term &quot;autophagy&quot; comes from the Greek words for &quot;self&quot; (auto) and &quot;eating&quot; (phagy), literally meaning &quot;self-eating.&quot;

When a cell undergoes autophagy, it encloses some of its own components—like damaged proteins or organelles—in a double-membrane vesicle known as an autophagosome. This autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome, an organelle that contains enzymes capable of breaking down biological molecules. The contents of the autophagosome are degraded within the lysosome and released back into the cell to be reused.

Autophagy serves many functions in the body. These include:
*Quality control: Autophagy helps to remove damaged proteins and organelles, which could otherwise harm the cell.
*Energy management: During times of nutrient scarcity, autophagy allows cells to recycle their own components to supply essential metabolic substrates, effectively helping the cell to survive under starvation conditions.
*Development and differentiation: Autophagy can modulate the levels of various proteins, influencing the processes of cellular development and differentiation.
*Immune response: By degrading intracellular pathogens and presenting antigens to the immune system, autophagy contributes to the body&#39;s immune responses.
*Disease prevention: Impaired autophagy has been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.
Autophagy is a vital process for the survival, growth, differentiation, and homeostasis of cells, and it has increasingly been the focus of biomedical research. In 2016, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy.
