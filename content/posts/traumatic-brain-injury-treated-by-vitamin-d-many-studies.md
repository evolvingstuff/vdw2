#### Vitamin D Protects against Traumatic Brain Injury via Modulating TLR4/MyD88/NF- κ B Pathway-Mediated Microglial Polarization and Neuroinflammation - July 2022

Biomed Res Int. 2022 Jul 15;2022:3363036. [doi: 10.1155/2022/3363036.](https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3363036.) eCollection 2022.

Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is associated with neuroinflammation and neurocognitive deficits in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of VD and the molecular mechanisms after TBI. After the intraperitoneal injection of VD (1 µg/kg), sensorimotor and cognitive function was assessed via a series of behavioral tests in TBI rats. Traumatic outcomes were investigated by brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and morphologic staining. In vitro, cellular viability and cytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons were detected via the MTT method and LDH release. Hippocampal oxidative stress-related enzymes and proinflammatory mediators and the serum concentration of VD were analyzed by ELISA. The expression of VDR, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κ B p65 was measured by Western blot. Furthermore, the levels of M1/M2 microglial markers were quantified using real-time PCR and Western blot. VD treatment significantly increased the serum level of VD and the hippocampal expression of VDR. 

VD not only effectively alleviated neurocognitive deficits, brain edema, and BBB disruption but also promoted hippocampal neuronal survival in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, VD therapy prevented excessive neuroinflammation and oxidative stress caused by TBI. Mechanically, the hippocampal expression of TLR4, MyD88, and nuclear NF-κ B p65 was elevated in the TBI group but robustly restrained by VD treatment. Taken together, VD provides an important neuroprotection through modulating hippocampal microglial M2 polarization and neuroinflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κ B pathway.

#### 13% of those average age 75 recently had a TBI - April 2024

 **Incidence of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Longitudinal Cohort of Older Adults** 

JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(5):e2414223. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.14223

Erica Kornblith, PhD1,2; L. Grisell Diaz-Ramirez, MS1,3; Kristine Yaffe, MD1,2,4,5,6; et alW. John Boscardin, PhD1,3,6; Raquel C. Gardner, MD7

 **Key Points** 

* Question  How common is traumatic brain injury (TBI) among older adults in the US?

* Findings  Over an 18-year study period, this cohort study found that  **12.9%**  of 9239 study respondents experienced TBI. Race and ethnicity, sex, cognition, educational level, and medical conditions were associated with TBI status.

* Meaning  Findings of this study suggest that incident TBI is common among older adults and may be associated with demographic or social factors.

Importance  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at the highest rate in older adulthood and increases risk for cognitive impairment and dementia.

Objectives  To update existing TBI surveillance data to capture nonhospital settings and to explore how social determinants of health (SDOH) are associated with TBI incidence among older adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This nationally representative longitudinal cohort study assessed participants for 18 years, from August 2000 through December 2018, using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and linked Medicare claims dates. Analyses were completed August 9 through December 12, 2022. Participants were 65 years of age or older in the HRS with survey data linked to Medicare without a TBI prior to HRS enrollment. They were community-dwelling at enrollment but were retained in HRS if they were later institutionalized.

Exposures  Baseline demographic, cognitive, medical, and SDOH information from HRS.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Incident TBI was defined using inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, diagnosis codes received the same day or within 1 day as the emergency department (ED) visit code and the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) code, after baseline HRS interview. A cohort with TBI codes but no ED visit or CT or MRI scan was derived to capture diagnoses in nonhospital settings. Descriptive statistics and bivariate associations of TBI with demographic and SDOH characteristics used sample weights. Fine-Gray regression models estimated associations between covariates and TBI, with death as a competing risk. Imputation considering outcome and complex survey design was performed by race and ethnicity, sex, education level, and Area Deprivation Index percentiles 1, 50, and 100. Other exposure variables were fixed at their weighted means.

Results  Among 9239 eligible respondents, 5258 (57.7%) were female and 1210 (9.1%) were Black, 574 (4.7%) were Hispanic, and 7297 (84.4%) were White. Mean (SD) baseline age was 75.2 (8.0) years. During follow-up (18 years), 797 (8.9%) of respondents received an incident TBI diagnosis with an ED visit and a CT code within 1 day, 964 (10.2%) received an incident TBI diagnosis and an ED code, and 1148 (12.9%) received a TBI code with or without an ED visit and CT scan code. 

Compared with respondents without incident TBI, respondents with TBI were 

* more likely to be female (absolute difference, 7.0 <span>[95% CI, 3.3-10.8]</span>; P < .001) and 

* White (absolute difference, 5.1 <span>[95% CI, 2.8-7.4]</span>; P < .001), 

* have normal cognition (vs cognitive impairment or dementia; absolute difference, 6.1 <span>[95% CI, 2.8-9.3]</span>; P = .001), 

* higher education (absolute difference, 3.8 <span>[95% CI, 0.9-6.7]</span>; P < .001), and 

* wealth (absolute difference, 6.5 <span>[95% CI, 2.3-10.7]</span>; P = .01), and 

* be without baseline lung disease (absolute difference, 5.1 <span>[95% CI, 3.0-7.2]</span>; P < .001) 

* (n)or functional impairment (absolute difference, 3.3 <span>[95% CI, 0.4-6.1]</span>; P = .03).

In adjusted multivariate models, lower education (subdistribution hazard ratio <span>[SHR]</span>, 0.73 <span>[95% CI, 0.57-0.94]</span>; P = .01), Black race (SHR, 0.61 <span>[95% CI, 0.46-0.80]</span>; P < .001), area deprivation index national rank (SHR 1.00 <span>[95% CI 0.99-1.00]</span>; P = .009), and male sex (SHR, 0.73 <span>[95% CI, 0.56-0.94]</span>; P = .02) were associated with membership in the group without TBI. Sensitivity analyses using a broader definition of TBI yielded similar results.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this longitudinal cohort study of older adults, almost 13% experienced incident TBI during the 18-year study period. For older adults who seek care for TBI, race and ethnicity, sex, and SDOH factors may be associated with incidence of TBI, seeking medical attention for TBI in older adulthood, or both.

   * Paucity of vitamin D significantly affects the consequences of a brain injury. Deficiency of vitamin D along with traumatic brain injury (TBI) elevates the risk of severity of the injury. This possibly affects the therapeutic regimen prescribed for TBI which may have a negative effect on its outcome. Pre-clinical trials suggested that the levels of vitamin D influence the recovery and outcome after a TBI. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to cause more deterioration in patients with severe TBI than in the ones with mild TBI. This clearly validates the necessity of screening the levels of vitamin D in neural deficit in order to reduce the risk of morbidity, neurocognitive disorders, osteomalacia, and cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in TBI and how it affects the recovery and subsequent quality of life of the patient.

* "The statistic of 3.8 million Americans a year gets bandied about, sometimes linked to mild head injuries from sports and other times to brain injuries of all kinds. Falls, recreational activities, car crashes, and domestic violence all can cause head trauma."

* "Six months after falling off the horse, my final, lingering symptom—the feeling of pressure in my head when I’d been working for too long—went away. I recovered but was left wondering why it had taken so much time for me to be routed to the care that I needed. I’ll never know if I would have gotten better without it, but I suspect recovery would have, at the very least, taken much longer. Why had I—a patient with a brain injury—been the one sifting through scientific papers and online support groups rather than getting these referrals from my doctor? In our American health-care system, many patients are expected to be their own advocates, but in this case, when a better, clearer path to recovery is so well established, it seems like that should have been unnecessary."

#### NFL has required extra-padded helmets during practice since 2022 (cut TBI in half)

One can hope that the NFL in the future will notice that taking vitamin d and/or omega-3 reduces TBI severity and recovery time.

Suspect that they also prevent TBI.
