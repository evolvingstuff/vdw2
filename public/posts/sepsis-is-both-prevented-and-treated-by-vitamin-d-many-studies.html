Several studies highlight the impact of sepsis on the gut microbiome and intestinal function:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Microbiome Disruption</strong> : Sepsis can lead to a dysregulated host response to infection, resulting in significant alterations in the gut microbiome. This includes a loss of beneficial microbial species and an increase in pathogenic bacteria, which can exacerbate the condition and lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction and death.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intestinal Failure</strong> : Critically ill patients with sepsis often suffer from gut failure, characterized by symptoms such as absent bowel signs, diarrhea, abdominal distension, and poor intestinal motility. These symptoms, when present together, are associated with a higher mortality rate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gut Permeability</strong> : Sepsis induces significant dysfunction in the intestinal barrier, leading to increased permeability. This allows bacteria to translocate from the gut into the bloodstream, perpetuating the inflammatory response and contributing to the severity of sepsis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mycobiome Dysbiosis</strong> : Sepsis and trauma patients often exhibit significant disturbances in their gut fungal communities, with a depletion of commensal fungi and an overgrowth of pathogenic fungi like Candida. This dysbiosis can further compromise gut health and increase the risk of secondary infections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Impact of Antibiotics</strong> : The use of antibiotics, while necessary for treating infections, can also disrupt the gut microbiome, leading to a decrease in microbial diversity and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This disruption can worsen the patient&rsquo;s condition and complicate recovery.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the gut plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of sepsis, and maintaining gut health is essential for improving outcomes in septic patients</p><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Do-people-with-S6HusR.pS8uicNx8_BGFCA>Perplexity References</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=69100-hits-for-sepsis-vitamin-d---feb-2025-google-scholar>69,100 hits for sepsis &ldquo;vitamin d&rdquo; - Feb 2025 (Google Scholar)</h4><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=sepsis+%22vitamin+d%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,48">Google Scholar</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>A Comprehensive Review of the Immunomodulatory Effects of Vitamin D in Sepsis- Feb 2024 ]https://10.7759/cureus.53678|FREE PDF]</p></li><li><p>Should I Supplement Vitamin D in a Patient With Sepsis? - March 2024 <a href=https://10.6705/j.jacme.202403_14(1).0001>FREE PDF</a></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Yes - single high dose of >400,000 IU</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Association between vitamin D status and sepsis in children: A meta-analysis of observational studies June 2020, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.08.010>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.08.010</a>   <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/sepsis-meta-compresspdf.pdf>PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong> only 1.13X more likely - low level, did not consider loading dose</p></li><li><p>Rapidly Increasing Serum 25(OH)D Boosts the Immune System, against Infections—Sepsis and COVID-19 July 2022, <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14142997>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14142997</a> FREE PDF</p></li><li><p>Single dose of 150,000 IU of Vitamin D Reduce Sepsis in Children - <strong>RCT</strong> June 2020 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520926890>https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520926890</a> <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/150k-sepsis-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p></li></ul><blockquote><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/150k-sepsis.png alt=image width=600></blockquote><blockquote><p>Note: loading dose was so tiny that the vitamin D levels were only raised by 6 ng</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><ul><li><p>Novel biomarker for predicting sepsis mortality: vitamin D receptor - Aug 2021 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211034733>https://doi.org/10.1177/03000605211034733</a> FREE PDF</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D Deficiency: An Underestimated Factor in Sepsis? 2023 - <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032924>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032924</a>   <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/sepsis-2023-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a></strong> did not consider loading dose</p></li><li><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/sepsis-2023.png alt=image width=900></li></ul><hr><h4 id=is-sepsis-treated-by-vitamin-d---asked-httpssearchsciphiai-jan-2024>Is sepsis treated by &ldquo;Vitamin d&rdquo;? - asked <a href=https://search.sciphi.ai/>https://search.sciphi.ai/</a> Jan 2024</h4><p>Vitamin D has emerged as a potential modulator in the immune response to sepsis, a condition characterized by a severe immune reaction to infections <a href=https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:sjbxn/pdf/>23</a>.

It is critical to identify risk factors associated with a poor prognosis in septic patients in order to develop new therapy options. Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin cholecalciferol &lt; 20 ng/mL) is common in critical and septic patients. Serum vitamin D concentrations are associated with an increased incidence of mortality in critically ill adult patients. In critically ill patients, vitamin D supplementation (a very high vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol loading dosage as a single bolus dose ranging from 400,000 to 540,000 IU) is feasible and safe. Some of the trials and their post-hoc analyses evaluating vitamin D supplementation in severely sick individuals, including septic patients, suggested possible benefits in mortality (reduced 28-day mortality in the range of 8.1%—17.5%), and other outcomes (reduction in hospital length in the range from 9 to 18 days, and decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation in the range from 5 to 10 days). Despite the fact that many studies support the provision of vitamin D to septic patients, there are still many studies that contradict this opinion, and there is still debate about the recommendation to use vitamin D in sepsis. A pragmatic clinical approach in severe sepsis could be supplementation of vitamin D if serum levels are diminished (&lt; 30 ng/ mL).</p><p>It appears that a single ultrahigh dose of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) could be administered to the septic patient via an enteral tube, followed by daily or monthly maintenance doses.</p><p>Parenteral administration <span>[&ldquo;non-gut: topical, injection (too slow), inhaled, etc.&rsquo;&rsquo;]</span> might be reserved for a subgroup of septic patients with gastrointestinal, hepatic, or renal dysfunction. Future clinical trials designed exclusively for septic patients are required to assess the potential advantages of vitamin D. Possible impacts of selective activators of vitamin D receptors, such as paricalcitol, should be elucidated in sepsis. This emphasizes the requirement for more study and confirmation of any potential beneficial effects of vitamin D in sepsis.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/should-i-supplement-vitamin-d-in-a-patient-with-sepsis-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-deficiency-an-underestimated-factor-in-sepsis--feb-2023>Vitamin D Deficiency: An Underestimated Factor in Sepsis? – Feb 2023</h4><p>Int.

Patients with sepsis were divided into a general sepsis group and a severe sepsis group (including septic shock) according to the criteria for the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2012. According to the diagnostic criteria established by the American Endocrine Society, and on the basis of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3]</span>, sepsis patients with deficiency <a href=25(OH)D3%2020-30%20%CE%BCg/L>25(OH)D3 20-30 μg/L</a> or insufficiency <a href=25(OH)D3%20%3C%2020%20%CE%BCg/L>25(OH)D3 &lt; 20 μg/L</a> of vitamin D were divided into D3 treatment group ( <strong>supplemented 300 kU vitamin D3</strong> ) and placebo group (injected 1 mL physiological saline). 28th day was set as the endpoint, and the patients with sepsis were divided into a survival group and a death group. The levels of serum 25(OH)D3 in each group were measured by the electrochemical luminescence method, and the difference in 25(OH)D3 levels among patients with different severity, gender, and age were recorded. Procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), blood routine, liver and kidney function, electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis, acute physiology, and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure score (SOFA), duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of ICU stay of patients with sepsis were observed.

The primary outcome was the incidence, prevalence, relative risk, or odds ratio of having sepsis or bloodstream infection between patients with vitamin D deficiency and controls.</p><p>RESULTS: The initial search yielded 647 articles. Twenty-one articles underwent full-length review, and data were extracted from 10 observational studies. The pooled odds ratio of sepsis in participants with vitamin D deficiency was <strong>1.78</strong> (95 % confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 1.55 to 2.03, p &lt; 0.01) compared with controls in studies that reported participant numbers and was 1.45 (95 % CI = 1.26 to 1.66, p &lt; 0.01) in studies that reported an adjusted odds ratio of vitamin D deficiency for developing sepsis. Statistical between-study heterogeneity was low (I(2) = 0 % and 5 %, respectively). The standardized mean difference of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with sepsis and controls was -0.24 (95 % CI = -0.49 to 0.00, p = 0.05) and lower in the sepsis group compared with non-sepsis or control participants.

Recent studies have shown that vitamin D receptors (VDR) are present in almost all the tissues and cells in the human body. In addition, several studies have revealed that vitamin D is important in immunomodulation, regulation of inflammation and cytokines, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, muscle strength, and muscle contraction. Patients with sepsis have a high mortality rate and high deficiency in vitamin D. In addition, septic patients have decreased vitamin D binding-protein (DBP) levels which further exacerbate the vitamin D deficiency. The role of vitamin D treatment in sepsis syndrome has been evaluated in an animal model of sepsis where 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 <span>[1,25(OH)2D3]</span> administration was associated with improved blood coagulation parameters in sepsis associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p><p>Vitamin D treatment in vitro has also been demonstrated to modulate levels of the systemic inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as well as inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation and vasodilation of vascular endothelium.</p><p>Vitamin D may enhance the induction of the antimicrobial peptides, cathelicidin, and b-defensin, which have been described on mucosal and epithelial surfaces as acting as the body&rsquo;s first line of defense against viral and bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation may divert attention from relatively simple, natural, and low-cost methods of preventing severe sepsis and septic shock.</p><p><strong>Further prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trials of adjunctive vitamin D therapy in patients who are vitamin D deficient are needed in the management of human sepsis syndrome.</strong></p><hr><h3 id=sepsis-and-vitamin-d-inchildren>Sepsis and Vitamin D in children</h3><h4 id=vitamindwiki>VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/sepsis-in-infants-48-x-more-likely-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Sepsis in infants 4.8 X more likely if poor vitamin D receptor – March 2018">Sepsis in infants 4.8 X more likely if poor vitamin D receptor – March 2018</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/sepsis-in-first-year-of-life-is-much-more-likely-if-preterm-low-vitamin-d style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Sepsis in first year of life is much more likely if preterm (low Vitamin D) – May 2017">Sepsis in first year of life is much more likely if preterm (low Vitamin D) – May 2017</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/treatment-of-neonate-sepsis-greatly-aided-by-vitamin-d-rct style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Treatment of neonate sepsis greatly aided by Vitamin D – RCT June 2019">Treatment of neonate sepsis greatly aided by Vitamin D – RCT June 2019</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/3x-less-septic-shock-in-children-with-sepsis-getting-150000-iu-of-vitamin-d-rct style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: 3X less Septic Shock in children with sepsis getting 150,000 IU of Vitamin D - RCT June 2020">3X less Septic Shock in children with sepsis getting 150,000 IU of Vitamin D - RCT June 2020</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/septic-children-have-low-vitamin-d-54-studies-ignored-vitamin-d-receptor-meta-analysis style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Septic children have low Vitamin D (54 studies, ignored Vitamin D Receptor) – meta-analysis April 2019">Septic children have low Vitamin D (54 studies, ignored Vitamin D Receptor) – meta-analysis April 2019</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/infant-sepsis-strongly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Infant sepsis strongly associated with low vitamin D – Aug 2014">Infant sepsis strongly associated with low vitamin D – Aug 2014</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=role-of-vitamin-d-and-parathyroid-hormone-levels-in-prediction-of-late-onset-sepsis-among-preterm-infants---june-2024>Role of Vitamin D and Parathyroid Hormone Levels In Prediction of Late Onset Sepsis among Preterm Infants - June 2024</h4><p><a href=10.21608/ANJ.2024.276513.1087>10.21608/ANJ.2024.276513.1087</a> PDF behind paywall</p><p>&ldquo;Conclusion: Preterm neonates with low vitamin D levels are more likely to develop sepsis with more disease severity, higher mortality, and higher duration of hospital admission also, a percentage of critically ill neonates have vitamin D deficiency&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=neonatal-sepsis-47-x-more-likely-if-mother-was-vitamin-d-insufficient---feb2020>Neonatal Sepsis 4.7 X more likely if mother was Vitamin D insufficient - Feb 2020</h4><p><strong>Is Lower Vitamin D Level Associated With Increased Risk of Neonatal Sepsis?

These criteria described above were proposed by several medical societies and may continue to be modified by other medical groups. For example, pediatric groups use the same four criteria listed above but modify the values for each to make the SIRS criteria for children. Other groups want to add criteria, but currently, this is the most widely accepted definition.</p><p><strong>What causes sepsis?</strong></p><p>The majority of cases of sepsis are due to bacterial infections, some are due to fungal infections, and very few are due to other causes of infection or agents that may cause SIRS. The infectious agents, usually bacteria, begin infecting almost any organ location or implanted device (for example, skin, lung, gastrointestinal tract, surgical site, intravenous catheter, etc.). The infecting agents or their toxins (or both) then spread directly or indirectly into the bloodstream. This allows them to spread to almost any other organ system. SIRS criteria result as the body tries to counteract the damage done by these blood-borne agents.</p><p>Common bacterial causes of sepsis are gram-negative bacilli (for example, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. corrodes, and Haemophilus influenza in neonates). Other bacteria also causing sepsis are S. aureus, Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species, and Neisseria; however, there are large numbers of bacterial genera that have been known to cause sepsis. Candida species are some of the most frequent fungi that cause sepsis. In general, a person with sepsis can be contagious, so precautions such as hand washing, sterile gloves, masks, and clothing coverage should be considered depending on the patient&rsquo;s infection source.</p><p><strong>What are the risk factors for sepsis?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The very young and the elderly are at greatest risk</p></li><li><p>People in an intensive-care unit</p></li><li><p>People with weakened or compromised immune systems</p></li><li><p>People with devices such as IV catheters, breathing tubes, or other devices</p></li><li><p>People with extensive burns</p></li><li><p>People with severe trauma</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the treatment for sepsis?</strong></p><p>In almost every case of sepsis, patients need to be hospitalized, treated with appropriate intravenous antibiotics, and given therapy to support any organ dysfunction. Sepsis can quickly cause organ damage and death; therapy should not be delayed as statistics suggest as high as a 7% mortality increase per hour if antibiotics are delayed in severe sepsis. Most cases of sepsis are treated in an intensive-care unit (ICU) of the hospital.</p><p>Physicians agree that the faster the patient with sepsis is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis and fewer complications, if any, for the patient.</p><p><strong>Sepsis mortality decreased by 15 percent if conventionally treated within 3 hours - May 2017</strong></p><p>Time to Treatment and Mortality during Mandated Emergency Care for Sepsis - NEJM</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/sepsis-mortality-decreased-by-15-percent.jpg alt=image><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fast-treatment-of-sepsis-helps.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=http://tristatehospital.org/page/sepsis>Sepsis is an equal opportunity Killer</a></strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/sepsis---the-equal-opportunity-killer.jpg alt=image><p><a href=https://www.slideshare.net/changezkn/management-of-sepsis-5553438>it contains 45 additional Sepsis charts</a></p><hr><h4 id=is-sepsis-responsible-for-20-of-deaths-worldwide-asked-chat-gpt-jan-2-2024>Is Sepsis Responsible for 20% of Deaths Worldwide?: Asked Chat-GPT Jan 2, 2024</h4><p>ChatGPT: I did a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/bing/redirect?query=Sepsis%20responsible%20for%2020%25%20of%20deaths%20worldwide">quick search</a> and here&rsquo;s what I discovered.</p><p>Yes, sepsis is responsible for a significant portion of deaths worldwide.

The metabolic demand from inefficiencies in anaerobic metabolism, mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction, increased cellular turnover, and free-radical damage result in the increased focus of micronutrients in sepsis, as they play a pivotal role in these processes. In the present review, we will evaluate the potential role of micronutrients in sepsis, specifically, thiamine, l-carnitine, vitamin C, Se, and vitamin D. Each micronutrient will be reviewed in a similar fashion, discussing its major role in normal physiology, suspected role in sepsis, use as a biomarker, discussion of the major basic science and human studies, and conclusion statement. Based on the currently available data, we conclude that thiamine may be considered in all septic patients at risk for thiamine deficiency and l-carnitine and vitamin C to those in septic shock. Clinical trials are currently underway, which may provide greater insight into the role of micronutrients in sepsis and validate standard utilization.</p><p><strong>A portion of the table from Sci-Hub</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/sepsis-b1.jpg alt=image width=300></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1749775588"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1749775588",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1749775588"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1749775588"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1749775588"></script></body></html>
