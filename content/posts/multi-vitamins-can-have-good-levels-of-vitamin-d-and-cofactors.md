We are starting  to see (April 2010) some multivitamins which have good levels of vitamin D (2000 - 4000 IU) along with many cofactors which have been identified for good calcium metabolism and rebuilding bones.

The following is one example:

Vitacost has Synergy Cardiolift. 180 capsules for $40.  Since 6 capsules = 1 serving,a bottle lasts 30 days.  

One serving includes 4000 IU of vitamin D3,  5000 IU of vitamin A (there is a contoversy as to vitamin A being an antagonist to vitamin D) 400 mcg Chromium, 40 mcg of vitamin K-2, 200 mg Resveratrol, 6 mg of Lutein, 300 mcg of Zeaxanthin, 3 mg of Boron, and many other items, but no silicon
