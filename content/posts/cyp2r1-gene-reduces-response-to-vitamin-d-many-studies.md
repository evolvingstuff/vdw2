#### CYP2R1 was the gene most associated with increased risk of Ischemic Stroke - Feb 2023

 **Whole-Exome Sequencing Analyses Support a Role of Vitamin D Metabolism in Ischemic Stroke**

Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a highly heritable trait, and genome-wide association studies have identified several commonly occurring susceptibility risk loci for this condition. However, there are limited data on the contribution of rare genetic variation to IS.

Methods: We conducted an exome-wide study using whole-exome sequencing data from  **152 058 UK Biobank participants** , including 1777 IS cases. We performed single-variant analyses for rare variants and gene-based analyses for loss-of-function and deleterious missense rare variants. We validated these results through

* (1) gene-based testing using summary statistics from MEGASTROKE-a genome-wide association study of IS that included 67 162 IS cases and 454 450 controls, 

* (2) gene-based testing using individual-level data from 1706 IS survivors, including 142 recurrent IS cases, enrolled in the VISP trial (Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention); and

* (3) gene-based testing against neuroimaging phenotypes related to cerebrovascular disease using summary-level data from 42,310 UK Biobank participants with available magnetic resonance imaging data.

Results: In single-variant association analyses, none of the evaluated variants were associated with IS at genome-wide significance levels (P<5×10-8). In the gene-based analysis focused on loss-of-function and deleterious missense variants, rare genetic variation at CYP2R1 was significantly associated with IS risk (P=2.6×10-6), exceeding the Bonferroni-corrected threshold for 16 074 tests (P<3.1×10-6). Validations analyses indicated that  **CYP2R1**  was associated with IS risk in MEGASTROKE (gene-based test, P=0.003), with IS recurrence in the VISP trial (gene-based test, P=0.001) and with neuroimaging traits (white matter hyperintensity, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy) in the UK Biobank neuroimaging study (all gene-based tests, P<0.05).

Conclusions: Because  **CYP2R1**  plays an important role in vitamin D metabolism and existing observational evidence suggests an association between vitamin D levels and cerebrovascular disease, our results support a role of this pathway in the occurrence of IS.
