#### Zika birth problems can be virtually prevented when women have enough vitamin D during their first trimester:

* Vitamin D strengthens woman's [immune system](/tags/immune-system.html)

* Vitamin D strengthens the [placenta immune system](/posts/virus-blocking-by-placenta-when-mother-has-enough-vitamin-d) 

#### Enough vitamin D might be provided by a single dose of 200,000 IU vitamin D

* $1 approximate cost of 200,000 IU of vitamin D*

* More vitamin D needed if overweight: (500,000 IU if obese - Vitamin D gets locked away in fatty tissue) 

#### This same immune system benefit is obtained from about 4 days of sunbathing**

* Vitamin D from the sun appears to provide about [3X more benefit](/posts/ms-prevention-by-uv-is-2x-better-than-prevention-by-vitamin-d-levels) than capsule.

* Sunbathing for a day provides about 16,000 IU of vitamin D 

>    * Note: more ‘’days’’ are needed for those with darker skin or if overweight

> * Note: A single large dose (200,000 IU) strengthens immune systems for more than 1 month, thus one

> &nbsp; &nbsp; 50,000 IU capsule = benefit to immune system of about 1 day of sunbathing

#### Cost concerns:

* Funding options include:

> Donations by citizens of each country

> Donations by foreign citizens - similar to disaster relief

> Money from tourist organizations/companies

> Money from AID agencies

> Paid by the pregnant woman getting the vitamin D

> Donation of vitamin D by suppliers

* Education/marketing costs

* Distribution costs to be covered

* Number of pregancies (30,000 to 1,000,000)

* Number of countries (1 to 30)

#### Timing - Needs to be started today!

Assuming 400 million people live in Zika affected countries

Assuming 10 pregancies annually per 1,000 population

Assuming only 1 in 4 are near Zika infected regions

About  **1 million pregnant women**  can benefit from strengthened immune systems

### Other situations to be considered soon

1. Woman might become pregnant (might need booster shot of vitamin D every 2 months)

1. Man or woman traveling to a Zika region

1. Woman already suspected to have Zika (with or without symptoms)

1. Woman previously had Zika and then got pregnant (probably no vitamin D needed)

1. Probably prevent Zika symptoms

1. Prevent GBS and other problems

1. Also reduce symptoms from Dengue, Chikungunya and other mosquito virus
