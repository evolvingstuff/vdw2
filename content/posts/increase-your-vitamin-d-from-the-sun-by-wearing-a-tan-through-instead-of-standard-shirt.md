Standard shirts block virtually all ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

Tan-through shirts permit some UVA (tan) and UVB (vitamin D) radiation to get to the skin

Tan-through shirt appears to have an equivalent SPF = 2 in UVB spectra

Thus, the skin covered by a tan-thru shirt generates about 1/2  of the vitamin D than that of skin directly exposed to the sun

If you want to generate the same amount of vitamin D and have less UVB on each square inch on skin you can expose more skin to the UVB.

 **Maximizing the UVB/UVA ratio appears to** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Reduce the damage to the skin

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Increase the amount of vitamin D generated

UVB/UVA is maximized at solar noon +- 2 hours.

I (Henry Lahore, admin of VitaminDWiki) purchased a tan-through T shirt July 2013

 **Update March 2015 - own several "vitamin D" shirts** 

There are several companies making that type of shirt

 **I happened to buy mine from: [http://www.tanthrough.com/index.htm](http://www.tanthrough.com/index.htm)**

### Relative number of minutes in sun

* 45 minutes long sleeved shirt + **pants**  (11% skin)

* 20 minutes T shirt +  **pants**  (25% skin)

* 14  minutes T shirt +  **shorts**  (35% skin)

* 13 minutes Tan-through T shirt  +  **pants**  (38% skin) = 25% + (26% trunk X 50% shirt)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **tan-through T shirt provides about as much vitamin D as wearing shorts** 

* 10 minutes no shirt +  **pants**  (50% skin)

* 7 minutes no shirt,+  **shorts**  (88% skin)

What I normally wear in the summer when mowing the lawn, shopping: Tan-thru T shirt + shorts  = 75% skin

### Note: The above does not indicate IU of vitamin D as the amount of time also varies with:

* latitude 

* standing up/lying down 

* season, 

* skin color

### Of course, not wearing a shirt is often socially unacceptable for

* seniors, and many adults

* obese

* women

* Golfing, playing baseball, gardening, walking in a park, bicycling, hiking, jogging, picnicking, etc.

### Also, a tan-through shirt should keep you somewhat warmer in cooler temperatures.

&nbsp;

#### Note: A standard T shirt has about 1/100 UVB  vs tan-through has 1/2 UVB

&nbsp;

#### Update June 2014 - bought a poloshirt which is tan thru

 **From their literature.** 

Microsol fabric is a gas infused polymer with 2X the surface area of standard fabric - allowing more wicking moisture

lets more of the tanning rays and less of the burning rays to pass thru

Found a 2008 patent  **application**  http://www.google.com/patents/WO2008129278A2?cl=en which specifically mentions use for  **burka.**  Apparently a patent was not awarded.

[Many companies have tan-thru fabric on Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/tan-through-swimwear-fabric-%2528microsolv%2529.html)

Perhaps I will get around to making a superman logo which I can occasionally attach to the shirt
