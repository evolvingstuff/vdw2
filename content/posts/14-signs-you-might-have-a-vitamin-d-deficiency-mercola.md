During cold and flu season, and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D to help reduce your risk of viral and bacterial illness.<sup>5,</sup><sup>6</sup> A blood test is the best way to determine your vitamin D levels, but here are some symptoms that may indicate your levels are low.

 **1.Aching muscles —**  Nearly half of all adults are affected by muscle pain.<sup>7</sup> Researchers believe most of those are deficient in vitamin D. Some studies have suggested that nerves have vitamin D receptors that affect the perception of pain. In one animal model, research demonstrated a vitamin D-deficient diet can induce deep muscle hypersensitivity that was not connected to low levels of calcium.<sup>8</sup>

 **2.Painful bones —**  Vitamin D regulates the level of calcium in your body, necessary to protect bone health.<sup>9</sup> Vitamin D deficiency can cause your bones to soften, called osteomalacia. This may be a precursor to osteoporosis.

 **3.Fatigue —**  This is a common symptom of a variety of different health conditions, including sleep deprivation. Researchers have found that supplementing cancer patients suffering from fatigue can improve their symptoms.<sup>10</sup>

In one study<sup>11</sup> using 174 adults with fatigue and stable medical conditions, the researchers found 77.2% were deficient in vitamin D. After normalizing their level, the fatigue symptoms improved significantly.

 **4.Reduced muscle performance —**  Vitamin D deficiency is as common in athletes as in others. Vitamin D is crucial for muscle development, strength and performance. Older adults taking a vitamin D supplement have a reduced risk of falls and improved muscle performance.<sup>12</sup>

Correction through oral supplementation or sensible sun exposure may reduce symptoms of stress fractures, musculoskeletal pain and frequent illness. Vitamin D also has a direct effect on muscle performance. In one paper from the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the author wrote:<sup>13</sup>

“Higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced injury rates and improved sports performance. In a subset of the population, vitamin D appears to play a role in muscle strength, injury prevention, and sports performance.”

 **5.Brain health —**  Vitamin D is also essential for your brain health. Symptoms of deficiency can include dementia caused by an increase of soluble and insoluble beta-amyloid, a factor in Alzheimer's disease.<sup>14</sup> Research has also found an association with depression<sup>15</sup> that may be associated with the function of vitamin D buffering higher levels of calcium in the brain.<sup>16</sup>

Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women can increase the risk of autism and schizophrenic-like disorders in the baby.<sup>17</sup> One study of people with fibromyalgia found a vitamin D deficiency was more common in those who had anxiety and depression.<sup>18</sup> Another looked at vitamin D deficiency in obese subjects and found a relationship between low levels of vitamin D and depression.<sup>19</sup>

 **6.Poor sleep —**  The mechanism linking vitamin D and poor sleep quality has not been identified. But research has found people with low levels of vitamin D have poor quality sleep and a higher risk of sleep disorders.<sup>20</sup>

 **7.Sweaty head —**  Excessive sweating, especially on your head, or a change in your pattern of sweating, can indicate a vitamin D deficiency.<sup>21</sup>

 **8.Hair loss —**  Vitamin D is crucial to the proliferation of keratinocytes and plays an important role in your hair cycle. The vitamin D receptor appears to play a role in the anagen phase of hair growth, leading researchers to conclude, "Treatments that upregulate the vitamin D receptor may be successful in treating hair disorders and are a potential area of further study."<sup>22</sup>

 **9.Slow-healing wounds —**  Chronic wounds are a major public health challenge.<sup>23</sup> In the U.S. 2% of the population is affected by chronic wounds and it is estimated to account for 5.5% of the cost of health care in the U.K. NHS. Vitamin D promotes wound healing and the creation of cathelicidin, a peptide that fights wound infections.<sup>24</sup>

 **10.Dizziness —**  Evidence from animal models suggests that vitamin D is critical in the development of the inner ear,<sup>25</sup> which affects balance and coordination. Analysis of people with vestibular neuritis, characterized by vertigo, showed lower serum vitamin D levels than in people without vestibular neuritis.<sup>26</sup>

 **11.Heart problems —**  Clinical studies have shown that vitamin D3 improves circulation and can help improve high blood pressure.<sup>27</sup> In one study<sup>28</sup> researchers discovered that vitamin D3 also has a significant effect on the endothelial cells that line your cardiovascular system. They found that it helped balance concentrations of nitric oxide and [peroxynitrite](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/01/15/health-effects-of-emf-exposure.aspx), which improved endothelial function. 

 **12.Excess weight —**  How vitamin D affects obesity has not been identified. However, data do show there is a high probability of deficiency in people who are obese.<sup>29</sup>

 **13.Recurring infections —**  There have been multiple epidemiological studies that show vitamin D deficiency can increase the risk of infection and raise the severity, particularly in [respiratory tract infections](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/12/11/do-vitamin-d-supplements-help-prevent-respiratory-tract-infections.aspx).<sup>30</sup> Multiple studies have demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency increases the potential risk for severe disease and mortality, especially in those who are critically ill.<sup>31</sup>

 **14.Reduced cognitive function —**  Data show that vitamin D deficiency increases your risk of dementia twofold<sup>32</sup> and raises your risk of impaired cognitive function.<sup>33</sup>
