“Rotavirus is  **the most common cause of severe diarrhoea**  among infants and young children.<sup>[1]</sup>”

“ Nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once by the age of five”

Wikipedia chart shows extremly strong seasonal variation in the virus

Seasons with high vitamin D have low rotavirus

Background: For children under five years of age, one-billion seven-hundred million episodes of diarrhea were seen worldwide, and seven-hundred thousand of these cases died due to diarrhea. Rotavirus is an important cause of diarrhea in this age group, and many studies have shown that Vitamin D plays a pivotal role for the immune system, as well as directing antimicrobial peptide gene expression. In addition, lower vitamin D levels were correlated with higher infectious diseases rates, such as respiratory tract infections, tuberculosis, and viral infections.

Methods: Seventy patients with rotaviral diarrhea and sixty-seven healthy patients were included in this study. In this research we compared serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3]</span>, parathormone, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, complete blood count parameters, and C-reactive protein levels of pre-school children hospitalized due to rotaviral diarrhea and healthy children. Additionally, the birth weight, feeding properties of the first six months of life, vitamin D and multivitamin supplements, and rotaviral vaccinations were evaluated in each group.

Results: There were no differences between the groups regarding gender and age. However, the 25(OH)D3 levels in the patients with rotaviral diarrhea and the healthy group were significantly different: 14.6 ± 8.7 and 29.06 ± 6.51, respectively (p < 0.001). The results showed that serum 25(OH)D3 levels of <20 ng/ml (odds ratio: 6.3; 95% CI: 3.638-10.909; p < 0.001) were associated with rotaviral diarrhea.

Conclusions: This study proves that low vitamin D is associated with rotaviral diarrhea. This result is the first in the literature, and should be repeated in larger controlled clinical studies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
