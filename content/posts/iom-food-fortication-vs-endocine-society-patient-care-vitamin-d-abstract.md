# Short-term and long-term consequences and concerns regarding valid assessment of vitamin D deficiency: comparison of recent food supplementation and clinical guidance reports

Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition & Metabolic Care: 19 September 2011, [doi: 10.1097/MCO.0b013e32834be798](https://doi.org/10.1097/MCO.0b013e32834be798)

Hollis, Bruce W.

Purpose of review: The function and use of vitamin D supplementation has become very controversial. This review attempts to provide a balanced perspective with respect to the experimental findings published in the past 18 months.

Recent findings: The recent contrasts between the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report and the Endocrine Societies report have caused great confusion with respect to the dietary requirement for vitamin D as well as the amount of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D that is desirable. 

Much recent data contradict the suggestions of the IOM report with respect to vitamin D's role in chronic disease such as 

* cancer, 

* cardiovascular function, 

* immune function and 

* autoimmune ailments such as multiple sclerosis.

Summary: Controversy regarding supplementation with vitamin D is fueled by the different purposes of the 

* IOM (guidance for food fortification and not to individualized patient care) and the 

* Endocrine Societies (patient care) reports. 

Healthcare providers should formulate their own opinions with respect to vitamin D as it pertains to the care of their patient.
