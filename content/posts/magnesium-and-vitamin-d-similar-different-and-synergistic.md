#### They are also synergistic, that is, increasing one helps the other.

#### Interesting to note the similarities and differences of Magnesium and Vitamin D

 **Similar** 

* Widespread deficiency of both is due primarily to a single cause during the past century

* Little toxicity

* One needs the other to work properly: being deficient in one can cause problems with the other

* Increasing either decreases the rates of many of the same diseases

* Both have strong interactions with Calcium and Vitamin K2

 **Different** 

* Magnesium has no long term storage in the body (not in fat) like Vitamin D does

* Very noticeable reaction if take too much Magnesium, but not vitamin D

* Body can only absorb so much Magnesium per 6 hours – no limit with vitamin D

* There are a variety of magnesium compounds – with different bioavailability and reactions

#### Hearing Loss was originally associated with only Vitamin D

* [Search PubMed "hearing loss" AND "magnesium" ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22hearing+loss%22%5BAll+Fields%5D)+AND+%22magnesium%22%5BAll+Fields%5D) 115 hits as of March 2022

> Generally Magnesium helps treat sudden hearing loss and protects against loss from high intensity sounds

* [Phase 2 study examining magnesium-dependent tinnitus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249877) 2011

> 532 milligrams of Mg daily reduced Tinnitus in 3 months

> No mention of Vitamin D - which often helps Magnesium

#### Health problems if dificient in BOTH Vitamin D and Magnesium - 2019

 **Magnesium Supplementation in Vitamin D Deficiency** 

Review Am J Ther . Jan/Feb 2019;26(1):e124-e132. [doi: 10.1097/MJT.0000000000000538.](https://doi.org/10.1097/MJT.0000000000000538.)

Background: Vitamin D and magnesium (Mg) are some of the most studied topics in medicine with enormous implications for human health and disease. Majority of the adults are deficient in both vitamin D and magnesium but continue to go unrecognized by many health care professionals.

Areas of uncertainty: Mg and vitamin D are used by all the organs in the body, and their deficiency states may lead to several chronic medical conditions. Studies described in the literature regarding these disease associations are contradictory, and reversal of any of these conditions may not occur for several years after adequate replacement. One should consider the supplementation therapy to be preventative rather than curative at this time.

Data sources: PubMed search of several reported associations between vitamin D and Mg with diseases.

Results: Vitamin D and Mg replacement therapy in elderly patients is known to reduce the nonvertebral fractures, overall mortality, and the incidence of Alzheimer dementia.

Conclusions: Vitamin D screening assay is readily available, but the reported lower limit of the normal range is totally inadequate for disease prevention. Based on the epidemiologic studies, ∼75% of all adults worldwide have serum 25(OH)D levels of <30 ng/mL. Because of the recent increase in global awareness, vitamin D supplementation has become a common practice, but Mg deficiency still remains unaddressed. Screening for chronic magnesium deficiency is difficult because a normal serum level may still be associated with moderate to severe deficiency. To date, there is no simple and accurate laboratory test to determine the total body magnesium status in humans. Mg is essential in the metabolism of vitamin D, and taking large doses of vitamin D can induce severe depletion of Mg. Adequate magnesium supplementation should be considered as an important aspect of vitamin D therapy.
