 **Post hoc analysis – from PDF** 

There were 39 dropouts, almost 3 times higher than initially estimated. Drug-related dropouts were the most frequent cause. The corrected ARRc, used to avoid the potential bias of early dropout on ARR estimate, was significantly lower in the cholecalciferol group both in the ITT (rR = 0.502, 95% CI 0.326–0.764; p = 0.001) and in the completers’ population (rR = 0.395, 95% CI 0.186–0.801; p = 0.01). 

* When dropouts were considered as relapse, the observed effect of the cholecalciferol treatment was significant (HR = 0.508, 95% CI 0.286–0.901; p = 0.02). 

* When considering drug-related dropout as a failure, 66% fewer relapses were found in the cholecalciferol group compared with placebo (HR = 0.333, 95% CI 0.164–0.675;
