#### Will COVID-19 Shots Drive an Epidemic of Autism?

* "Male rats were the ones in which biochemical changes translated into an obvious manifestation of autism-like behaviours. Note that this was “pronounced”. Interestingly, this correlates with the human condition, in which boys are diagnosed with autism more often than girls. Of particular concern is the loss of neurons in the brain. Depending on the location of the brain, there were 24-38% fewer neurons in males born from dams (mothers) that had received the COVID-19 shot."

* "Here is the problem: Children born to mothers that were coerced into taking COVID-19 shots have not yet reached the age of three. We must now wait another 1.5 years, at least, and likely two or more years to accrue data from enough children to determine whether harms have been caused."

 **<span style="color:#F06;">Note: 30 micrograms of vaccine were given to the mother rats, which is the exact same amount of vaccine given to mother humans. Since rats weight 220 grams and humans weigh 80,000 grams,  the rats got  80,000/220 = 380X more vaccine per body weight than humans</span>**
