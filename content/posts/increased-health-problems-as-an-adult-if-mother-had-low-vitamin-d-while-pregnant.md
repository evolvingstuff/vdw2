#### Maternal Vitamin D Levels During Gestation and Impact on Offspring’s Risk of Non-communicable Diseases in Adulthood

Lipophilic Vitamins in Health and Disease Chapter pp 341–354 cost $29

Rohini Ravindran Nair & Surya Ramachandran 

Low vitamin D levels have been linked to conditions, including cardiovascular disease, certain malignancies, dementia, depression, diabetes, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and autoimmune diseases. Although vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide issue, it deserves specific attention in pregnant and nursing mothers due to the potential for unfavorable maternal–fetal outcomes. Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly prevalent among women of reproductive age and has been associated with gestational hypertension, preterm birth, and poorer offspring health.

This chapter focuses on Vitamin D deficiency during gestation and its adverse effects on the fetal growth of neonates, during adolescence and adulthood of offspring. The role of epigenetic maternal–fetal adaptation mechanisms and vitamin D metabolism in the development of metabolic diseases is also explored.
