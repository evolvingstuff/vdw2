Background

The impact of low vitamin D status on asthma, asthma morbidity and control is unclear. We aimed to investigate in adults the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and prevalent asthma as well as asthma exacerbations.

Methods

A cohort of Israeli adults aged 22-50 years with documented vitamin D status were extracted from Clalit Health Services (HMO) between July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2012. Among this population those with physician diagnosed asthma and asthma exacerbations were identified. Asthma exacerbations were defined as any of the following: prescription for oral corticosteroids, > 5 prescriptions for short acting beta agonists and more than 4 visits to a physician for asthma. Logistic regression models assessed the associations between vitamin D and both asthma and asthma exacerbations.

Results

Approximately 308,000 members with at least one vitamin D measurement were included in the cohort. Among them, 6.9% ( **21,237** ), had physician diagnosed asthma versus 5.7% in the general population. Serum 25OHD levels across both groups were similar. However, among those with vitamin D deficiency, the odds of having an exacerbation were 25% greater compared to those with levels in the normal range. This association remained significant after controlling for known confounders.

Conclusions

While there was no significant association between vitamin D status and physician diagnosed asthma, there was a strong association with asthma exacerbations. The presented evidence supports vitamin D screening in the subgroup of asthmatics that are uncontrolled and experience recurrent exacerbations.
