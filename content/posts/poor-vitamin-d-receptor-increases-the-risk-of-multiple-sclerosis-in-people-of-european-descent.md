There is evidence for a causal association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels and multiple sclerosis (MS), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We conducted a Mendelian Randomization study to estimate causal associations between vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding at a locus and MS susceptibility using genetic instrumental variables constructed from variants previously associated with allele-specific VDR-binding (VDR-binding variant; VDR-BV) and serum 25(OH)D. Two VDR-BV (rs2881514; rs2531804) were independently associated with MS and rs2881514 demonstrated significant interaction with 25(OH)D, providing evidence for a causal association between rs2881514 and MS. Our results demonstrate that genetic variation in individual VDR binding sites contributes to MS and are relevant to other autoimmune diseases for which a role for vitamin D has been implicated.

Abstract

Although evidence exists for a causal association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels, and multiple sclerosis (MS), the role of variation in vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding in MS is unknown. Here, we leveraged previously identified variants associated with allele imbalance in VDR binding (VDR-binding variant; VDR-BV) in ChIP-exo data from calcitriol-stimulated lymphoblastoid cell lines and 25(OH)D serum levels from genome-wide association studies to construct genetic instrumental variables (GIVs). GIVs are composed of one or more genetic variants that serve as proxies for exposures of interest. Here, GIVs for both VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D were used in a two-sample Mendelian Randomization study to investigate the relationship between VDR binding at a locus, 25(OH)D serum levels, and MS risk. Data for 13,598 MS cases and 38,887 controls of European ancestry from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Swedish MS studies, and the UK Biobank were included. We estimated the association between each VDR-BV GIV and MS. Significant interaction between a VDR-BV GIV and a GIV for serum 25OH(D) was evidence for a causal association between VDR-BVs and MS unbiased by pleiotropy. We observed evidence for associations between two VDR-BVs (rs2881514, rs2531804) and MS after correction for multiple tests. There was evidence of interaction between rs2881514 and a 25(OH)D GIV, providing evidence of a causal association between rs2881514 and MS. This study is the first to demonstrate evidence that variation in VDR binding at a locus contributes to MS risk. Our results are relevant to other autoimmune diseases in which vitamin D plays a role.

#### How does the incidence of multiple sclerosis vary with race?

 **Large Language Model conclusion to question:** 

The incidence of MS varies significantly by race and ethnicity, with whites of European ancestry historically being the most affected. However, recent studies have shown an increasing incidence among African Americans and unique disease characteristics and progression in African Americans and Hispanics:
