#### <span style="color:#F00;">Reasons to believe that Adenovirus-36 is a major risk factor for Obesity</span>

 **Fact:**  Some chickens have Adenovirus-36 (AD-36) (also Turkeys, Ducks, etc)

 **Fact:**  Birds with AD-36 gain weight

 **Fact:**  People with AD-36 antibodies are more likely to be obese than overweight

 **Fact:**  100% of monkeys infected with AD-36 gained weight

 **Fact:**  [animals (pet, lab, wild) living near humans have gained weight](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/obesity/)

 **Fact:**  Children and mice infected with AD-36 do NOT lose weight if they exercise

 **Fact:**  Adults with AD-36 antibodies weigh 50 lbs more

 **Fact:**   AD-36 alters human DNA so as to increase the number of human fat cells

 **Fact:**  If only one member of a twin is infected, only that one becomes heavier and fatter. (see 25 year overview)

 **Suspect:**  People infected with AD-36 become obese, not just overweight

 **Suspect:**  Pasture-raised chickens should be less likely to have AD-36 (better immune systems)

 **Suspect <span style="color:#F00;">Prevent:</span>**  Improving chicken immune system (Vitamin D or sun) will reduce % of chickens which are infected

 **Suspect <span style="color:#F00;">Prevent</span>:**  Improving the human immune system will reduce chance of getting the virus if eat infected chickens (or eggs?)

 **Fact <span style="color:#F00;">Fight:</span>**  Obese will lose 3X more weight if they add $10 of vitamin D to a weight-loss program (see below) 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: Details of the above facts are on this page

#### Obesity 2X more likely if Adenovirus - meta-analysis - 2021

 **Association of adenovirus 36 infection and obesity; An updated meta-analysis of community-based studies** 

Merical Virology 24 May 2021 https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2255

Arezoo Marjani,Alireza Khatami,Hassan Saadati,Milad Asghari,Mohammad Hossein Razizadeh,Aida Abbasi,Mohammad Zarei,Leila Beikzadeh,Alireza Soleimani.

As a health problem, obesity has several risk factors; it has been suggested that human adenovirus type 36 (HAdV-36) infections may possibly be associated with obesity. This updated meta-analysis was designed and conducted with an emphasis on articles published from 2015 to 2020. The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched up to 1 December 2020. Overall, pooled prevalence and odds ratio of antibodies against HAdV-36 in people with obesity and controls was assessed among different ages. Case-control and cohort studies were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of HAdV-36 infection in obese population was 31% (CI: 0.24%–0.38%) which was 32% in cases and 27% in controls, respectively; a significant association was found between the cases and the controls ( **OR, 1.84** ; 95% CI, 1.39–2.43), especially in  **children younger than 18 years of age (OR, 2.44** ; 95% CI, 1.85–3.22). A significant association between adenovirus infection and obesity was found, especially in adolescents.

 **Note: Vitamin D levels were HIGHER in obese vs overweight who had Andeovirus -36 antibodies** 

Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Adenovirus-36 (Ad-36) in overweight and obese patients and the effects of this virus on some metabolic parameters. 

Methodology: The study included 236 female patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25. The patients were separated into 2 groups as overweight (BMI: 25-29.99) and obese (BMI ≥ 30). To quantitatively determine the antibody (Ab) specific to adenovirus type 36 in the serum samples, the enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) method was used (AdV36-Ab, ELISA Kit, MyBioSource). Laboratory parameters were compared between patients who are Ad-36 Ab positive and negative.

Results: Of the total 236 patients, 82 (34.7%) were determined as Ad-36 positive and 154 (65.3%) were negative. Ad-36 Ab positivity  was statistically significantly higher in the obese group (p = 0.018). The HOMA-IR index, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein were found to be the same in both groups with no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). Vitamin D levels were significantly higher in BMI ≥ 30 Ad-36 Ab positive group than negative group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The frequency of Ad-36 Ab positivity was significantly higher in the obese group than in the overweight group. These results can be considered to shed a different perspective from previous reports in literature as only overweight and obese females were included. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to have shown that Ad-36 has the effect of elevating the Vitamin D

#### Obesity Due to a Virus: How this Changes the Game

by  **Richard Atkinson,**  MD [Obesity Action- date - before 2019?](https://www.obesityaction.org/community/article-library/obesity-due-to-a-virus-how-this-changes-the-game/) &nbsp; &nbsp;<span>[ADV36lab@Gmail.com]</span>

 **About the Author:** 

Richard Atkinson, MD, has worked in obesity treatment and research for 40 years. He is a past president of the former American Obesity Association and the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, and is the  **current editor of the International Journal of Obesity.** 

Often, educated physicians will say, “Obesity is a disease,” but not many people believe it.  **The government and insurance companies do not want to admit that obesity is a disease because then they would have to cover treatment as they do for other diseases** . Even a large portion of healthcare professionals who treat obesity do not necessarily think of obesity as a disease. This may be because the treatments they provide are based on obesity being a behavioral problem that can only be treated by changing behaviors, such as dietary and exercise habits and lifestyle.

But, what if obesity could be “caught,” like the common cold? What if there was a virus that made experimental animals fat and was associated with obesity in humans? How would politicians and other policymakers act if they could become infected by obesity simply by being close to an infected person? Would this make any difference in healthcare policy or change the discrimination suffered by individuals affected by obesity?

 **What if being affected by obesity was not your fault?** 

 **Obesity Emerges as an Epidemic** 

Have you ever wondered why obesity all of a sudden became a problem in the United States?  **Why did suddenly, around 1980, the prevalence of obesity begin to skyrocket at a rate 10 times faster than from 1960 to 1980? Did you know that obesity began to skyrocket all around the world around 1980, in rich and poor countries alike?** 

Fast foods, sodas, TV, computers, microwaves, bigger portions, no exercise at school and lots of other things are said to have “caused” the obesity epidemic in America; however, poor countries like Paraguay and Panama do not have many of these luxuries, and certainly not as many as we do. So, why do they have a higher rate of obesity than we do? Something must have changed in the environment all around the world in a very short period of time. What could do that? The answer: an infection could do that.

 **Adenovirus-36 (Adv36) May Cause Obesity** 

There IS a virus that causes obesity. Adenovirus-36 (Adv36) is a human “common cold” virus that is easily caught from an infected person who is coughing or sneezing, or if they do not wash their hands after having a bowel movement. At least one-third of people affected by obesity have been infected and multiple investigators all around the world have started to work on this virus.

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin began experimenting with Adv36 around 1995 and found that when they experimentally infected chickens and mice, the animals increased their body fat by 50 to 150 percent. Compared to uninfected animals, about 60 to 70 percent of infected animals became affected by obesity. The investigators then tested monkeys by  **squirting Adv36 up their nose** . This was an important experiment because Adv36 is a human virus and monkeys are the closest animal model to humans.  **One hundred percent of the infected monkeys gained weight.** 

A second experiment in a group of monkeys who had been in the animal facilities, from whom blood had been drawn and stored every six months for seven years, had Adv36 testing done on their blood. These monkeys were not deliberately infected, but  **all 15 became “naturally” infected throughout the seven years** . Body weight was stable before infection, but once they tested positive for Adv36, they started to gain weight. The investigators speculated that their human handlers became infected and brought in the virus.

A critically important finding surprised the researchers –  **infected animals did NOT eat more and did NOT do less exercise, but they still gained weight.** This virus causes obesity without changes in diet and exercise by changing metabolic rate and efficiency of food utilization.

 **Fact:** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Testing Adv36 in Humans</span>** 

The researchers then began to test humans, both affected by obesity as well as some not affected, in Wisconsin, New York, and Florida. The test for Adv36 is a blood test that is highly specific – if you have antibodies against Adv36, you have been exposed. More than 500 individuals were tested and the investigators found that 30 percent of the individuals affected by obesity and 11 percent of the individuals not affected by obesity had been infected.  **The infected people weighed more than 50 pounds more than the uninfected.** 

 **Fact:** 

Since these early studies, now more than 15,000 people in nine different countries have been tested for Adv36 infection. The frequency of infection varies in different countries and ranges from 6 percent in Belgium/Holland to 65 percent in Italy.  **All but one research group has found the prevalence of infection to be 20 percent or greater and the average is about 40 percent** . Studies in adults vary, but in all six known studies in children, Adv36 was associated in some way with obesity (see chart below).

 **How Contagious is Adv36?** 

A question that invariably is asked is, “Can I catch obesity from a person affected by obesity?” The answer is that it is very unlikely to be able to catch obesity from a person who has become affected by obesity due to the virus. The difference in metabolic rate is small, so it takes quite some time to gain large amounts of weight. The animal studies have the advantage of being able to tell exactly when the animal was infected and they showed that the virus persists two months or less. It takes much longer than two months to become affected by obesity, so the virus will be gone before the person gains a lot of weight.

 **Scientists have determined how the ADV36 virus works.** 

The DNA (genetic material) of the virus gets into the fat cells of the person or animal and causes them to bring in more fat and glucose from the blood and to make fat out of the glucose. The viral DNA also causes adult stem cells in the fat tissue to turn into fat cells, so the **total fat cell number increases** . Thus, an infected person will have bigger fat cells and more of them. Scientists have figured out the sequence of the DNA in Adv36, which gene in the virus causes the effect, and how this gene changes the chemistry inside fat cells to cause obesity.

 **Fact:** 

 **What if I am Infected?** 

What can you do if you are infected? This is a critical question for most people, because who cares if you are infected if you cannot do anything about it? The bad news is that at the present time, there are no specific treatments for Adv36. If you are already affected by obesity, the usual problems of losing weight and keeping it off will apply.

The good news is that if you are currently not affected by obesity, it is a lot easier to prevent obesity than to treat it. Some of the anti-obesity drugs work very well to prevent weight gain. Policy changes in some states will be needed to allow Adv36 infected, non-affected by obesity people to go on obesity drugs to prevent weight gain.

More good news is that at least one paper shows that  **people who are infected with Adv36 lose weight better than uninfected people** . So, it may be easier to lose weight; then, careful attention to diet, exercise and treatment with anti-obesity drugs may allow better weight maintenance. The bad news – people who are infected and lose weight may be more likely to gain it back more quickly if they do not pay attention to diet, activity and anti- obesity drugs.

Finally, some last good news – research is ongoing to identify antiviral agents that appear to work against Adv36 infection. And the best news of all, a vaccine has been developed that appears, in very early studies, to prevent infection with Adv36. More research is needed, but it appears that eventually, we will be able to prevent Adv36-induced obesity in those who do not have it and to treat it in those who do.

 **Conclusion** 

How will this information alter the way people affected by obesity and the disease of obesity are treated? A great deal of advocacy work is ahead to convince politicians and third-party payors to do the right thing; however, the knowledge that at least a portion of obesity is due to an infectious disease changes the entire debate.

#### Wikipedia Adenovirus_serotype_36

 **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenovirus_serotype_36)** 

Human adenovirus 36 (HAdV-36) or Ad-36 or Adv36 is one of 52 types of adenoviruses known to infect humans. AD-36, first isolated in 1978 from the feces of a girl suffering from diabetes and enteritis,<sup>[1]</sup> has long been recognized as a cause of respiratory and eye infections in humans.<sup>[2]</sup> It was first shown to be associated with obesity in chickens by Dr. Nikhil  **Dhurandhar** 

 **Role in obesity** 

There has been a positive correlation between body fat and the presence of AD-36 antibodies in the blood.<sup>[6]</sup> <sup>[7]</sup> Previous research showed that chickens or mice injected with similar types of viruses show a statistically significant weight gain.<sup>[3]</sup>

 **To date, AD-36 is the only human adenovirus that has been linked with human obesity** , present in 30% of obese humans and 11% of nonobese humans.<sup>[8]</sup> In addition, a study of obese Americans indicates that about 30% of the obese individuals and only 5% of non-obese individuals have antibodies to Ad-36.<sup>[3]</sup> Another study determined that  **children with the virus averaged 52 pounds heavier than those with no signs of it**  and obese children with the virus averaged 35 pounds heavier than obese children with no trace of the virus.<sup>[9]</sup> AD-36 causes obesity in chickens, mice, rats, and monkeys also

 **Human adenovirus = HAdV** 

 **Conclusions** 

The changes in cellular metabolism enacted by HAdV infection very closely mimic the metabolic phenotype of cancer cells. HAdV infection induces an increase in glucose and glutamine consumption to fuel glycolysis and glutaminolysis, which ultimately lead to an increase in nucleotide production for DNA replication. However, advanced metabolomic techniques have added some nuances to this understanding, as the metabolic profile of infected cells is influenced by cell density and cell type. In addition, different HAdV types modulate metabolism by different mechanisms. Although this may occur primarily through the HAdV oncoprotein E4ORF1, it potentially also occurs through the HAdV oncoprotein E1A. Understanding how this altered metabolism contributes to HAdV replication may provide the insight needed to use small molecules that influence metabolism as anti-viral therapies. In light of a recent report that HAdV may be present in a number of diverse human tumours <sup>[12]</sup>, understanding the metabolic modulation of HAdV may also have potential utility for cancer treatment.
