#### Vitamin D Receptor - reduced by Lyme, easily restored by supplements

##### [Chronic Lyme disease](https://mpkb.org/home/diseases/lyme) - includes VDR Feb 2019

 **The following text which is copied from the source, and has no active hyperlinks** 

 **Borrelia and the VDR** 

In the arms race of host–microbe co-evolution, successful microbial pathogens have evolved ingenious ways to evade host immune responses.9)

Studies have indicated that the dysregulation of VDR may lead to exaggerated inflammatory responses, raising the possibility that defects in Vitamin D and VDR signaling transduction may be linked to bacterial infection and chronic inflammation. Further characterization of Vitamin D/VDR will help elucidate the pathogenesis of various human diseases and in the design of new approaches for prevention and treatment. Jun Sun 10)

Since the VDR is at the heart of the innate immune system, bacteria can survive by discovering how to disable it through a variety of different actions. Actions accumulate and are more powerful than individual actions. In keeping with evolutionary theory,  **a growing number of substances and species have been shown to downregulate the activity of the VDR, one of which is Borrelia burgdorferi.**  Live Borrelia burgdorferi reduced VDR expression in monocytes (phagocytes) by 50 times, and lysates (“dead” Borrelia) reduced it by 8 times 11)

### Have any of the following been found to prevent or treat Lyme Disease: Resveratrol Omega-3 Magnesium Zinc Quercetin Curcumin Berberine Butyrate Sulforaphane Ginger "Essential oils" "intense exercise"?

#### Perplexity (using CLAUDE 3.5 SONNET Oct 2024)

Based on the available research, here's what we know about the potential of those compounds for preventing or treating Lyme disease:

 **Resveratrol** 

Resveratrol, found in Japanese knotweed, has shown some promise:

* It has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that may help against Lyme disease &nbsp;[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lyme-disease-treatment-2-herbal-compounds-may-beat-antibiotics)&nbsp;[5](https://www.lymedisease.org/rawls-natural-remedies-lyme/)

* A 2020 Johns Hopkins study found Japanese knotweed extract had greater activity against Borrelia burgdorferi (the Lyme bacteria) than some antibiotics &nbsp; [5](https://www.lymedisease.org/rawls-natural-remedies-lyme/)

* Resveratrol appears safe at typical supplement doses, though it may have blood-thinning effects&nbsp; [5](https://www.lymedisease.org/rawls-natural-remedies-lyme/)

 **Other Compounds** 

*  **Omega-3, magnesium, zinc, quercetin, curcumin:**  While these have general anti-inflammatory properties, there's no strong evidence specifically for Lyme disease prevention or treatment.

*  **Berberine:**  Some preliminary research suggests potential antimicrobial activity, but more studies are needed on its effects for Lyme disease.

*  **Butyrate, sulforaphane, ginger:**  No significant evidence was found regarding their use for Lyme disease.

*  **Essential oils:**  Oregano and thyme oils have shown some in vitro activity against B. burgdorferi, but clinical evidence is lacking &nbsp; [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10124234/)

 **Exercise** 

While exercise may have general health benefits, there's no evidence that "intense exercise" specifically prevents or treats Lyme disease.

 **Key Points** 

* None of these compounds are proven treatments for Lyme disease.

* The most effective prevention methods remain avoiding tick bites and prompt tick removal &nbsp;[8](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ticks-and-lyme-disease-symptoms-treatment-and-prevention)

* Antibiotics are the standard treatment for diagnosed Lyme disease &nbsp;[8](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ticks-and-lyme-disease-symptoms-treatment-and-prevention)

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease rather than relying solely on supplements or alternative remedies.

#### Lyme Disease Is Baffling, Even to Experts

Took 16 years to get her problem correctly diagnosed

* "Reported cases increased almost fivefold from 1992 to 2017, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that annual incidences have risen to more than 300,000, and may even range above 400,000"

* "After 40 years in the public-health spotlight, Lyme disease still can’t be prevented by a vaccine; eludes reliable testing; and continues to pit patients against doctors, and researchers against one another."

* "A significant percentage of people who had Lyme symptoms and later tested positive for the disease had never gotten the rash. Others had many characteristic symptoms but tested negative for the infection, and entered treatment anyway. Most startling, a portion of patients who had been promptly and conclusively diagnosed with Lyme disease and treated with the standard course of doxycycline didn’t really get better."

* "Today another epidemic rages unchecked: the number of Lyme disease cases has doubled since 2004, for a total of over 400,000."

* "At least 10 to 20 percent stay sick for a year, with 5 percent still suffering 15 years later—this among patients receiving early treatment, who have the best outcomes"

* 67 Lyme Disease [Clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/details?cond=lyme+disease&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search) as of 2019

* "In 2017, mosquito-borne West Nile virus, which currently infects about 2,000 people annually in the U.S. received $42 million in support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Lyme disease, with 20 times the number of reported cases, got half as much, a figure that has changed little in a decade"
