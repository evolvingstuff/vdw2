The current study investigated longitudinal associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) concentrations and quality of life in stage I–III colorectal cancer survivors up to 2 years after treatment.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Patients with colorectal cancer (n = 261) were included upon diagnosis. Home visits (including blood sampling) were performed at diagnosis and at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment. Serum 25OHD3 concentrations were measured using LC/MS-MS and adjusted for season. Validated questionnaires were used to assess global quality of life and cognitive functioning (EORTC-QLQ-C30), fatigue (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and Checklist Individual Strength, CIS), and depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed models and adjusted for sex, age, time since diagnosis, therapy, comorbidities, physical activity, and body mass index.</p><p>Results:</p><p>At diagnosis, 45% of patients were vitamin D deficient (&lt;50 nmol/L). After treatment, 25OHD3 concentrations increased on average with 3.1 nmol/L every 6 months. In confounder-adjusted models, 20 nmol/L increments in 25OHD3 were longitudinally associated with increased global quality of life <span>[β 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5–4.3]</span> and reduced fatigue (EORTC-QLQ-C30 subscale: β −3.5; 95% CI, −5.3 to −1.8 and CIS: β −2.8; 95% CI, −4.7 to −0.9). Observed associations were present both within and between individuals over time.</p><p>Conclusions:</p><p>Higher concentrations of 25OHD3 were longitudinally associated with better global quality of life and less fatigue in colorectal cancer survivors.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>This study suggests that higher 25OHD3 concentrations may be beneficial for colorectal cancer survivors. Future intervention studies are needed to corroborate these findings.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/higher-d-less-fatigue-colorectal-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=decrease-in-serum-vitamin-d-level-of-older-patients-with-fatigue----oct-2019>Decrease in Serum Vitamin D Level of Older Patients with Fatigue - Oct 2019</h4><p>Nutrients Volume 11 Issue 10 10.3390/nu11102531</p><p>by Manuela Pennisi 1,Giulia Malaguarnera 1,2ORCID,Giuseppe Di Bartolo 2,Giuseppe Lanza 3,4ORCID,Rita Bella 5ORCID,Eleonora Margherita Chisari 6,Omar Cauli 7ORCID,Enzo Vicari 8 andMichele Malaguarnera 2,7,*ORCID</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/fitigue-italian-senior.png alt=image width=600><p>Fatigue is characterized by reduced energy level, decreased muscle strength, and a variable degree of cognitive impairment. Recent evidences seem to link vitamin D deficiency to fatigue. The aim of this study was to assess and compare vitamin D status in a cohort of older subjects with and without fatigue. We recruited a total of 480 subjects, 240 patients with fatigue and 240 controls without fatigue, from the Cannizzaro Hospital of Catania (Italy). Fatigue severity was measured by the fatigue severity scale, whereas mental and physical fatigue were measured through the Wessely and Powell fatigue scale, respectively. We also measured several blood parameters and 25-OH vitamin D. Subjects with fatigue showed lower levels of vitamin D as compared with those without fatigue. Blood levels of parameters related to fatigue were normal in both groups of subjects, however, platelet, hemoglobin, hematocrit (p &lt; 0.05), mean corpuscular volume, C-reactive protein (CRP), iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the fatigue group with respect to the control group. Moreover, compared to controls, patients showed higher scores in the physical (p &lt; 0.001), mental (p &lt; 0.001), and severity (p &lt; 0.001) fatigue scales. Finally, vitamin D inversely correlated with fatigue severity (r = −0.428, p &lt; 0.01), whereas creatine kinase and CRP levels did not correlate with vitamin D. In conclusion, our data showed a direct link between vitamin D and fatigue in older subjects, suggesting translational implications in the diagnosis and management of these patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fatigue-corelatd-to-low-d-in-seniors.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=fatigue-decreased-somewhat-after-a-single-100000-iu-dose-of-vitamin-d---rct-dec-2016>Fatigue decreased somewhat after a single 100,000 IU dose of Vitamin D - RCT Dec 2016</h4><p>**Effect of vitamin D3 on self-perceived fatigue - A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial</p><p>Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Dec; 95(52): e5353. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000005353>doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000005353</a>**</p><p>Albina Nowak, MD,a,∗ Lukas Boesch, MD,a Erik Andres, MD,a Edouard Battegay, PhD,a Thorsten Hornemann, PhD,b Christoph Schmid, PhD,c Heike A.

To this end, a randomized controlled trial, ‘Palliative-D’, was conducted, comparing the effect of 4000 IU vitamin D3/day for 12 weeks to placebo in cancer patients admitted to palliative care. Pain was assessed as change in opioid dose and infections measured as days on antibiotics. Vitamin D-supplemented patients increased their opioid doses at a significantly slower rate than patients receiving placebo, i.e., 0.56 µg less fentanyl/h per week with vitamin D treatment. Vitamin D reduced self-assessed fatigue but did not affect antibiotic use or self-assessed Quality of life. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. In conclusion, correction of vitamin D deficiency may have positive effects on pain and fatigue in palliative cancer patients.</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p><p>The aim of the ‘Palliative-D’ study was to test the hypothesis that correction of vitamin D deficiency reduces opioid use in cancer patients admitted to palliative care. A multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in three home-based palliative care facilities in Sweden was performed. Patients with advanced cancer and 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 50 nmol/L were randomized to vitamin D3 4000 IU/day or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the difference of long-acting opioid use (fentanyl ug/h) between the groups during 12 weeks, based on four time points. Secondary outcomes included changes in antibiotic use, fatigue and Quality of Life (QoL). A total of 244 patients were randomized, and 150 patients completed the 12 weeks. The major reason for drop-out was death due to cancer. The vitamin D-group had a significantly smaller increase of opioid doses compared to the placebo-group; beta coefficient −0.56 (p = 0.03), i.e., 0.56 µg less fentanyl/h per week with vitamin D treatment. Vitamin D-reduced fatigue assessed with ESAS was −1.1 points after 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.01). Antibiotic use or QoL did not differ significantly between the groups. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. In conclusion, correction of vitamin D deficiency may have positive effects on opioid use and fatigue in palliative cancer patients, but only in those with a survival time more than 12 weeks.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/-palliative-d-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=the-effect-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-on-treatment-induced-pain-in-cancer-patients-a-systematic-review---aug-2022>The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Treatment-Induced Pain in Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review - Aug 2022</h4><p>Pain Management Nursing Volume 23, Issue 4, August 2022, Pages 458-466 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmn.2022.02.001>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmn.2022.02.001</a></p><p>Mitra Zarrati PhD ⁎ † 1, Mohammad Hassan Sohouli PhD ‡ 1, Sahar Aleayyub MSc ⁎, Naeemeh Keshavarz PhD §, Elham Razmpoosh PhD ‖, Mihnea-Alexandru Găman MD ¶ #, Somaye Fatahi PhD ⁎, Heshmatolah Heydari PhD †† ‡‡</p><p>Objectives</p><p>Despite the widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine by patients and physicians alike, there is no accurate evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation on treatment-induced pain in cancer patients. Thus, the aim of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to evaluate the impact of vitamin D administration on therapy-related pain in subjects diagnosed with malignant disorders.</p><p>Review analysis methods</p><p>We searched the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar databases up to October 2020 to identify published RCTs that investigated the use of vitamin D in the management of treatment-induced pain in individuals with cancer.</p><p>Results</p><p>Nine RCTs were detected. The median duration of the intervention was of 24 weeks (range 12-52 weeks) and dose of vitamin D employed was 2000-50000 IU of vitamin D3 weekly orally each day. Six RCTs reported a significant reduction in pain, whereas three did not detect a notable decrease of this variable. Of the six studies that reported an alleviation of pain, an RCT which recruited 60 participants and lasted for 24 weeks consisted of supplementation with high doses of vitamin D2 weekly for 8 weeks in women receiving anastrozole as adjuvant therapy, then supplementation with vitamin D2 monthly for 4 months, effectively alleviated the aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal syndrome (AIMSS). The results of the same RCT also suggested a beneficial effect of vitamin D on musculoskeletal pain.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Our results suggest that the supplementation with high doses of vitamin D in cancer patients with low serum levels of vitamin D, can be effective in reducing treatment-related pain.</p><p><strong>Section snippets</strong></p><p>Search Strategy</p><p>This systematic review was executed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria (Moher et al., 2015). Relevant articles were retrieved from the following electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, Clarivate Analytics Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar.
