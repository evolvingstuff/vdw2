#### [The, ahem, ‘Joy’ of Summer in Dubai](http://mideastposts.com/2011/06/23/the-ahem-joy-of-summer-in-dubai/)

Written by thehedonista (2011)

Upon awakening this morning, I could not see out my windows. Lion asked  me if it had been raining – the condensation was thick and punctuated  with large rivulets that revealed the jungle our garden has become. But if I look out the windows on the second storey, I can see nothing but beige. The light is dull, the sun shrouded in mother earth’s pollution – dust  and humidity.

The streets are silent, but for a man in orange  sweeping the curb and a gardener in grubby shalwar qameez dragging  a rusty lawn mower behind his bike. The joggers and dog walkers are  nowhere to be seen.  **Even bus children wait in the air conditioned zone  on their front doorsteps**  until the last moment when the school bus  toots. Outside has become the wild frontier – only the strong, mad or  unfortunate will brave it.

 **My day revolves around thirty second  walks between my car and cooled venues**  I leave early and ensure I  arrive in time to secure a good carpark at my destination. Others flout  the rules and double park wherever they please, knowing the parking  ticket is worth it to avoid the long walk in the heat. Not that there  are many parking inspectors on the job anyway.

 **On the radio, the news reader reminds us to check our tyres for tread and inflation.** Bitumen can get to 70ºC on days like this, hot enough to cause a second degree burn in 1 second **, and of course cause tyre blowouts. I am also careful not to leave my purse in the car when I lock it – not because of theft, which is a rare occurence here, but because** my credit cards could melt **.

Today I brave  Karama. The folks back home want a collection of good cheap knock-offs.  Even the polo shirts hanging outside on racks are hot to the touch.  Inside they have the AC set to max. A haze of humidity gathers at the  door where the temperatures clash, and no matter which way you are walking, you end up damp on the other side. My handbag man gives me a cuddle upon sealing the deal, and he recoils in soggy horror after accidentally touching my sweaty shirt-back.

At  pick-up, all the parents run from car to school foyer, where we wait illegally till the last moment. We have been instructed not to clutter  the public areas, but the thought of waiting outside is sickening. Small  talk with other mothers has all but ceased. Our sedentary indoor  lifestyle provides little in the way of news and anecdotes. Besides, the  heat makes us tired.

Everyone is tired.** <span style="color:#F33;">We get no sunshine and  are all vitamin D deficient</span> **. We are lethargic, moody, and our viruses  keep circulating in the perpetual air-conditioning, so we are all sick.** There  are those who work outside, and they are sicker, with heatstroke, never-ending headaches, urinary tract infections, high blood pressure,  and other effects of extreme heat and dehydration **. Heat-related deaths are not unheard of.** Outdoor labour is  banned between the hours of 12:30  and 3:30 **, but this is often ignored. I see them in their blue overalls,  wet from the shoulders to the waist, faces stained with dust and salt.  They wrap scarves on their heads in meager protection – I wonder if it  actually makes them hotter. At the traffic lights, from my air  conditioned car, I see them peering through my windows, and I wonder how  they can keep the malice from their tired stares. After all, I may not be  their boss, but my life in Dubai supports this employment and everything that comes with it.

Sometimes they even smile, and it makes me want to cry.** At  home **, I put on a new DVD for the kids, and we break the Lego construction from yesterday so we can start again. We play foozball,  UNO, build cubby houses with chairs and blankets. I bake, and blog, and  then blog about baking, and eventually, in our boredom we slump on the  couch and eat cupcakes.** On the weekend we go to malls **. We shop,  walk, ski, skate, abseil, play pinball, take rollercoaster rides, and  terrify tots in playcentres, all in malls. We eat in the malls. We buy  things we don’t need. We stop for coffee we don’t want. It’s all  expensive, and every moment we look forward to the day we can get back  in our pool. For it remains in the central yard of our compound, a  tempting yet deceitful cool blue colour, but hotter than a bath.

This week we have visitors – friends of my parents. We were supposed to go out Tuesday, but Margot was struck down by the suffocating air and spent the first 36 hours doubling and tripling her asthma medication so she could breathe.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), current data on vitamin D status are lacking. Aims: To inform Saudi public health authorities on the current status of blood levels vitamin D deficiency, we analyzed data from the Saudi Health Interview Survey. 

Materials and Methods: The Saudi Health Interview Survey (SHIS) is a cross-sectional national multistage survey of individuals aged 15 years and above on sociodemographic characteristics, tobacco consumption, diet, physical activity, health care utilization, different health-related behaviors, and self-reported chronic conditions. A total of** 10,735 participants **completed a health questionnaire and were invited to the local health clinics for biomedical exams. 

Results: 62.65% of female Saudis and 40.6% of male Saudis aged 15 years and above are deficient in vitamin D. Out of them, less than 1% males and less than 2% females consume vitamin D supplements. Women who have never married and obese individuals are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D, compared to men who were currently married and nonobese individuals. Those consuming vitamin D supplements are less likely to be deficient in vitamin D. 

Conclusions: Our study showed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Saudi men and women, and the results call for an increased awareness to ensure adequate levels of vitamin D for better health in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, our findings are certainly relevant for other countries in the Gulf region or countries with similar cultures, clothing, and religions.
