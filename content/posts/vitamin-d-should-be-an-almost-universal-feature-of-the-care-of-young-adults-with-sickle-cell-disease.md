Vitamin D deficiency (VDD), 25-OHD levels <20 ng/ml, is prevalent among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and is linked to acute and chronic pain and bone fracture in this population. There is limited literature regarding VDD-associated risk factors for SCD. 

We examined potential clinical and genomic parameters associated with VDD in 335 adults with SCD in a cross-sectional study. VDD was present in 65% of adult SCD patients, and 25-OHD levels independently and positively correlated with older age (P < 0·001) and vitamin D supplementation (P < 0·001). 25-OHD levels were higher in SCD patients over 40 years of age compared to the general African-American population. 

Both lower 25-OHD levels and increased pain frequency were associated with increased expression of SLC6A5 encoding glycine transporter-2 (GlyT2), a protein involved in neuronal pain pathways. Lower 25-OHD levels were also associated with increased expression of CYP3A4, and with decreased expression of GC (also termed DBP) and VDR, three genes involved in vitamin D metabolism. 

We conclude that  **<span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D supplementation should be an almost universal feature of the care of young adults with SCD, and that further research is warranted into genomic factors that regulate vitamin D metabolism in SCD</span>** .
