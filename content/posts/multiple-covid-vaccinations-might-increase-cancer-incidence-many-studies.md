#### Urgent plea for action on rise of turbo cancers - Nov 2024

 **[Substack - Phillip Altman](https://phillipaltman.substack.com/p/emergency?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1301027&post_id=151048167&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=ofo3r&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)** 

* "Oncologists, cancer surgeons, radiologists and medical specialists around the world are reporting a frightening elevated occurrence in unusually aggressive, late state cancers especially in younger individuals and cancer relapses in those previously successfully treated."

* "While it is difficult to deny the rise in total cancers using mortality and morbidity statistics and the rise of prescriptions for anti-cancer drugs, the health authorities continue to be wilfully blind and blame the rise on lockdowns, poor diets etc……….anything except the elephant in the room"

John Campbell’s video of today has an excerpt of a presentation by Dr. James Royal (UK cancer surgeon) on the rise of turbo cancers (17 min).

#### SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination and the Multi-Hit Hypothesis of Oncogenesis - Dec 2023

Cureus 15(12): e50703. doi:10.7759/cureus.50703

Cancer is a complex and dynamic disease. The “hallmarks of cancer” were proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg (2000) as a group of biological competencies that human cells attain as they progress from normalcy to neoplastic transformation. These competencies include self-sufficiency in proliferative signaling, insensitivity to growth-suppressive signals and immune surveillance, the ability to evade cell death, enabling replicative immortality, reprogramming energy metabolism, inducing angiogenesis, and activating tissue invasion and metastasis. Underlying these competencies are genome instability, which expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters their function(s). Additionally, cancer exhibits another dimension of complexity: a heterogeneous repertoire of infiltrating and resident host cells, secreted factors, and extracellular matrix, known as the tumor microenvironment, that through a dynamic and reciprocal relationship with cancer cells supports immortality, local invasion, and metastatic dissemination. This staggering intricacy calls for caution when advising all people with cancer (or a previous history of cancer) to receive the COVID-19 primary vaccine series plus additional booster doses. Moreover, because these patients were not included in the pivotal clinical trials, considerable uncertainty remains regarding vaccine efficacy, safety, and the risk of interactions with anticancer therapies, which could reduce the value and innocuity of either medical treatment.

After reviewing the available literature, we are particularly concerned that certain COVID-19 vaccines may generate a pro-tumorigenic milieu (i.e., a  **specific environment that could lead to neoplastic transformation** ) that predisposes some (stable) oncologic patients and survivors to cancer progression, recurrence, and/or metastasis. 

This hypothesis is based on biological plausibility and fulfillment of the multi-hit hypothesis of oncogenesis (i.e., induction of lymphopenia and inflammation, downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, activation of oncogenic cascades, sequestration of tumor suppressor proteins, dysregulation of the RNA-G quadruplex-protein binding system, alteration of type I interferon responses, unsilencing of retrotransposable elements, etc.) together with growing evidence and safety reports filed to Vaccine Adverse Effects Report System (VAERS) suggesting that some cancer patients experienced disease exacerbation or recurrence following COVID-19 vaccination. 

In light of the above and because some of these concerns (i.e., alteration of oncogenic pathways, promotion of inflammatory cascades, and dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system) also apply to cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we encourage the scientific and medical community to urgently evaluate the impact of both COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination on cancer biology and tumor registries, adjusting public health recommendations accordingly.

* "They essentially said it takes multiple different hits or insults to cells and their genetic machinery to cause a normal cell to become cancerous."

* " As we point out in our book Courage to Face COVID-19, it took over 40 years from when Sir Austin Bradford Hill causally associated smoking with lung cancer until there was capitulation by the medical orthodoxy."

#### Cancers Appearing in Ways Never Before Seen After COVID Vaccinations: Dr. Harvey Rischn- Sept 2023

 **[Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cancers-appearing-in-ways-never-before-seen-after-covid-vaccinations-dr-harvey-risch-5495364)** 

* “Some of these cancers are so aggressive that between the time that they're first seen and when they come back for treatment after a few weeks, they've grown dramatically compared to what oncologists would have expected for the way cancer normally progresses,”
