Pregnant women and newborns are at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. Our objective was to create a global summary of maternal and newborn vitamin D status. We completed a systematic review (1959–2014) and meta-analysis of studies reporting serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration in maternal and newborn populations. The 95 identified studies were unevenly distributed by World Health Organization (WHO) region: Americas (24), European (33), Eastern Mediterranean (13), South-East Asian (7), Western Pacific (16) and African (2). 

 **Average maternal**  25(OH)D concentrations ( **nmol L−1** ) by region were 

* 47–65 (Americas), 

* 15–72 (European), 

* 13–60 (Eastern Mediterranean), 

* 20–52 (South-East Asian), 

* 42–72 (Western Pacific) and 

* 92 (African). 

 **Average newborn**  25(OH)D concentrations (nmol L−1) were 

* 35–77 (Americas), 

* 20–50 (European), 

* 5–50 (Eastern Mediterranean), 

* 20–22 (South-East Asian), 

* 32–67 (Western Pacific) and 

* 27–35 (African). 

The prevalences of 25(OH)D <50 and <25 nmol L−1 by WHO region in pregnant women were: Americas (64%, 9%), European (57%, 23%), Eastern Mediterranean (46%, 79%), South-East Asian (87%, not available) and Western Pacific (83%, 13%). Among newborns these values were: Americas (30%, 14%), European (73%, 39%), Eastern Mediterranean (60%, not available), South-East Asian (96%, 45%) and Western Pacific (54%, 14%). 

By global region,  **average**  25(OH)D concentration varies  **threefold in pregnant women and newborns** , and 

prevalence of 25(OH)D  **<25 nmo L−1**  varies 

*  **eightfold in pregnant women**  and 

*  **threefold in newborns** . 

Maternal and newborn 25(OH)D concentrations are highly correlated. Addressing vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women and newborns should be a global priority. To protect children from the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency requires appropriate interventions during both pregnancy and childhood.
