Lee P. Vitamin D metabolism and deficiency in critical illness. - see below

* “Collectively these results provide unequivocal evidence that vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are highly prevalent among critically ill patients.”

* “These results demonstrate current replacement regimes are grossly inadequate.”

He ends by citing studies showing death in the ICU and the CCU is 2-3 times higher for the vitamin D deficient.

# Vitamin D metabolism and deficiency in critical illness.

Best Pract Res Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2011 Oct;25(5):769-81.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and has been associated with a diverse range of chronic medical conditions in the general population. 

In contrast, the prevalence, pathogenesis and significance of vitamin D deficiency have received little attention in acute medicine. 

Vitamin D deficiency is seldom considered and rarely corrected adequately, if at all, in critically ill patients. 

Recent recognition of the extra-skeletal, pleiotropic actions of vitamin D in 

* immunity, 

* epithelial function and 

* metabolic regulation 

may underlie the previously under-recognized contribution of vitamin D deficiency to typical co-morbidities in critically ill patients, including 

* sepsis, 

* systemic inflammatory response syndrome and 

* metabolic dysfunction. 

Improved understanding of vitamin D metabolism and regulation in critical illness may allow therapeutic exploitation of vitamin D to improve outcome in critically ill patients.
