&lt;p>BACKGROUND:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation varies with latitude, time of day, and season. Both spectral UV composition and ambient UV dose lead to different health outcomes at different latitudes. Finding the optimal time for sun exposure, whereby the positive effects of UV exposure (vitamin D) are facilitated and the negative effects (skin cancer, photoimmunosuppression) avoided are the most important consideration in modern skin cancer prevention programs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alzheimer disease 5X less likely with nonmelanoma skin cancer (lots of vitamin D)</title><link>/posts/alzheimer-disease-5x-less-likely-with-nonmelanoma-skin-cancer-lots-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/alzheimer-disease-5x-less-likely-with-nonmelanoma-skin-cancer-lots-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="nonmelanoma-skin-cancer-is-associated-with-reduced-alzheimer-disease-risk">Nonmelanoma skin cancer is associated with reduced Alzheimer disease risk&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>While squamous cell carcinoma of the skin has been closely associated with long term occupational exposure to the sun, risk of developing melanoma seems to be more associated with intermittent, high intensity sun exposure (MacKie and Aitchison, 1982; Lew et al., 1983)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Various epidemiologic studies support the finding that the number of severe sunburns and total childhood sun exposure are positively associated with the development of melanoma (Holman et al., 1986; Scotto and Fears, 1987; Cust et al., 2011; Newton-Bishop et al., 2011; Volkovova et al., 2012)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Melanoma REDUCED by those getting the most UV, unless 5 blistering sunburns while in teen years</title><link>/posts/melanoma-reduced-by-those-getting-the-most-uv-unless-5-blistering-sunburns-while-in-teen-years.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/melanoma-reduced-by-those-getting-the-most-uv-unless-5-blistering-sunburns-while-in-teen-years.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="long-term-ultraviolet-flux-other-potential-risk-factors-and-skin-cancer-risk-a-cohort-study">Long-term Ultraviolet Flux, Other Potential Risk Factors, and Skin Cancer Risk: A Cohort Study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Two conflicting hypotheses have been tested concerning the association between a personal history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and risk of other malignancies. One hypothesis is that as a marker of extensive sunlight exposure and hence vitamin D status, NMSC should be inversely associated with risk of other cancers. Alternatively, under the multiple primary cancer model, NMSC is postulated to be an informative first cancer to study as a marker of increased risk of subsequent primary cancer diagnoses. In this journal issue, Ong and colleagues report the results of a large-scale study in the United Kingdom with findings that NMSC was significantly associated with increased risk of a broad spectrum of other malignancies, with the associations stronger the younger the age of onset of NMSC. These results are consistent with the larger body of evidence on this topic, which is highly asymmetrical in favor of the multiple primary cancer hypothesis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hypothesis - Dark skin evolved to avoid skin cancer</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-dark-skin-evolved-to-avoid-skin-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-dark-skin-evolved-to-avoid-skin-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="was-skin-cancer-a-selective-force-for-black-pigmentation-in-early-hominin-evolution">Was skin cancer a selective force for black pigmentation in early hominin evolution?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Melanin provides a crucial filter for solar UV radiation and its genetically determined variation influences both skin pigmentation and risk of cancer. Genetic evidence suggests that the acquisition of a highly stable melanocortin 1 receptor allele promoting black pigmentation arose around the time of savannah colonization by hominins at some 1-2 Ma. The adaptive significance of dark skin is generallybelievedtobeprotectionfromUVdamagebut thepathologies that might have had a deleterious impact on survival and/or reproductive fitness, though much debated, are uncertain. Here, I suggest that data on age-associated cancer incidence and lethality in albinos living at low latitudes in both Africa and Central America support the contention that skin cancer could have provided a potent selective force for the emergence of black skin in early hominins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D looks promising for head and neck squamous cell cancers</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-looks-promising-for-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-cancers.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-looks-promising-for-head-and-neck-squamous-cell-cancers.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="immune-regulatory-activity-of-vitamin-d3-in-head-and-neck-cancer">Immune regulatory activity of vitamin d3 in head and neck cancer.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>While vitamin D exhibits a multitude of cellular effects that can impact on cancer development and progression, this review focuses on its immune modulatory effects. These immune modulatory effects can be both direct and indirect. Compared to other cancer types, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have received less attention, but are a fascination immunologically because of the profound extent to which they inhibit immune defenses. This review describes the mechanisms of some of these immune inhibitory processes and how vitamin D can help overcome aspects of this immune suppression.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Decreased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer by working outdoors in Europe</title><link>/posts/decreased-risk-of-non-melanoma-skin-cancer-by-working-outdoors-in-europe.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/decreased-risk-of-non-melanoma-skin-cancer-by-working-outdoors-in-europe.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="occupational-exposure-to-ultraviolet-radiation-and-risk-of-non-melanoma-skin-cancer-in-a-multinational-european-study">Occupational Exposure to Ultraviolet Radiation and Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer in a Multinational European Study&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Abstract:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essential features of the epidemiology and photobiology of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) in Norway were studied in comparison with data from countries at lower latitudes. Arguments for and against a relationship between UV radiation (UV) from sun and artificial light and CMM are discussed. Our data indícate that UV is a carcinogen for CMM and that intermittent exposures are notably melanomagenic. This hypothesis was supported both by latitude gradients, by time trends and by changing patterns of tumor density on different body localizations. However, even though UV radiation generates CMM, it may also have a protective action and/or an action that improves prognosis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skin cancer increases other cancers (low-vitamin D)</title><link>/posts/skin-cancer-increases-other-cancers-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/skin-cancer-increases-other-cancers-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="skin-cancer-may-increase-subsequent-primary-malignancy-riskhttpdrkenboakewordpresscomtagvitamin-d20-dr-boake">&lt;a href="http://drkenboake.wordpress.com/tag/vitamin-d/%20">Skin cancer may increase subsequent primary malignancy risk&lt;/a> Dr. Boake&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Incidence rates of skin cancer increase with decreasing latitude in Norway, as in many other countries with white populations. The latitudinal trends of the incidence rates of skin cancer were studied and compared with data for vitamin D-induced by UV and for vitamin D intake. The north-south gradient for CMM incidence rates on sun exposed skin is much smaller than those for BCC and SCC, and that for BCC is smaller than that for SCC. This indicates that SCC and BCC are mainly due to solar UVB, while UVA may play a significant role for CMM and a smaller role for BCC, since the north-south gradient of annual UVB fluences is larger than that of UVA fluences. However, there is an inverse latitudinal gradient of skin cancer in central Europe. This is probably due to a gradient of skin color, since white skin is an important determinant of increased risk of skin cancer. The role of vitamin D for skin cancer risk is difficult to evaluate, since serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, as well as vitamin D intakes, are widely different from country to country. Still, epidemiological evidence indicates a role: for melanomas arising on non-sun exposed body localizations (uveal melanomas, melanomas arising in the vulva and perianal/anorectal regions) there appears to be no latitudinal gradient, or, a negative gradient, i.e., increasing rates with decreasing latitude as would be expected if UV-generated vitamin D plays a protective role. Both skin cancer risk and vitamin D photosynthesis decrease with increasing skin darkness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prostate Cancer increased melanoma rate by 2X (vitamin D not mentioned)</title><link>/posts/prostate-cancer-increased-melanoma-rate-by-2x-vitamin-d-not-mentioned.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/prostate-cancer-increased-melanoma-rate-by-2x-vitamin-d-not-mentioned.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="personal-history-of-prostate-cancer-and-increased-risk-of-incident-melanoma-in-the-united-states">Personal History of Prostate Cancer and Increased Risk of Incident Melanoma in the United States&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Although the epidemiologic evidence that adequate vitamin D nutrition protects against non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is limited, recent evidence that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is protective is compelling. The role of vitamin D signaling in limiting the proliferation while promoting the differentiation of keratinocytes, the major cell in the epidermis from which NMSC are derived, is well known. However, recent findings that mice lacking the VDR are predisposed to skin cancer has brought to the fore the question of how the VDR is protective. In this review we will look first at the role of vitamin D signaling in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. We will examine two pathways, β-catenin (CTNNB) and hedgehog (HH), that are regulated by vitamin D signaling and may contribute to the dysregulated proliferation and differentiation in the absence of VDR. We will then examine the failure of VDR deficient keratinocytes to repair DNA damaged by UVB. Finally we will examine the change in long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) expression in VDR null keratinocytes that in other cells is associated with malignant transformation, a potential newly appreciated mechanism by which vitamin D signaling is protective against NMSC.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Molecular Link between Vitamin D and Cancer Prevention</title><link>/posts/molecular-link-between-vitamin-d-and-cancer-prevention.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/molecular-link-between-vitamin-d-and-cancer-prevention.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Nutrients 2013, 5(10), 3993-4021; doi:10.3390/nu5103993&lt;/p>

&lt;p>1α-Hydroxylase (CYP27B1), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the biologically active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), is expressed in the skin. To assess the correlation between progression of melanocytic tumors and CYP27B1, we analyzed its expression in 29 benign nevi, 75 primary cutaneous melanomas, 40 metastases, and 4 re-excision and 6 normal skin biopsies. Immunoreactivity for CYP27B1 was significantly lower in the vertical growth phase and metastatic melanomas (0.6 and 0.5 arbitrary units, respectively) in comparison with nevi and radial growth phase tumors (1.2 and 1.1 arbitrary units, respectively); and expression was reduced in more advanced lesions (Clark levels III-V, Breslow thickness ≥2.1 mm; 0.8 and 0.7 arbitrary units, respectively). There was an inverse correlation between CYP27B1 and Ki-67 expression. Furthermore, CYP27B1 expression was reduced in primary melanomas that created metastases in comparison with non-metastasizing melanomas. Reduced CYP27B1 expression in radial growth phase was related to shorter overall survival (810 versus 982 versus 1151 days in melanomas with absent, low, and high CYP27B1 immunoreactivity), and low CYP27B1 expression in radial growth phase and vertical growth phase was related to shorter disease-free survival (114 versus 339 versus 737 days and 129 versus 307 versus 737 days, respectively, in melanomas with absent, low, and high CYP27B1). Also, CYP27B1 expression was inversely related to melanin in melanoma cells in vivo and melanoma cells cultured in vitro. Thus, reduction of CYP27B1 correlates with melanoma phenotype and behavior, and its lack affects the survival of melanoma patients, indicating a role in the pathogenesis and progression of this cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merkel cell carcinoma (a rare skin cancer) recurrence 3X more likely if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/merkel-cell-carcinoma-a-rare-skin-cancer-recurrence-3x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/merkel-cell-carcinoma-a-rare-skin-cancer-recurrence-3x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-is-associated-with-greater-tumor-size-and-poorer-outcome-in-merkel-cell-carcinoma-patients">Vitamin D deficiency is associated with greater tumor size and poorer outcome in Merkel cell carcinoma patients&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>As with so many health topics in America, the public is often misinformed. Such is the case with the &amp;ldquo;health dangers of sunshine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-dangers-of-sun-exposure">The Dangers of Sun Exposure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently, some 600,000 new cases of skin cancer are reported every year.(1) Over the years, there have been numerous publications making the claim that sunshine exposure increases the risk of developing skin cancer as well as hastens aging of the skin. It would seem, therefore, that &amp;ldquo;avoiding the sun&amp;rdquo; would be an obvious response to this problem. It is believed that Ultraviolet A rays are the cause of hastened aging and skin cancer while the Ultraviolet B rays are the source of sunburn. The UVB rays are also the source for making Vitamin D in the skin. Melanomas are currently the tenth most common form of cancer in the U.S.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Most German skin cancer doctors recommend both sunscreen and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/most-german-skin-cancer-doctors-recommend-both-sunscreen-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/most-german-skin-cancer-doctors-recommend-both-sunscreen-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-supply-from-sun-or-pill-">Vitamin D supply: from sun or pill? –&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Recommendations concerning the intake of vitamin D and/or sunlight exposure in the handling of patients with vitamin D deficiency remain a matter of debate. The present study of the German network of dermato-oncologists (Onkoderm e.V.) refers to an inquiry conducted among general practitioners on this and related issues. Based on 448 answers provided to 10 distinct questions, the consulted physicians &lt;strong>recommended vitamin D intake (94% replies)&lt;/strong> and/or exposure to sunlight (63% replies) in their patients with vitamin D deficiency. An average of approximately 26 min daily unprotected exposure to sunlight at midday in spring and summer was recommended. Nevertheless, &lt;strong>91% of the physicians considered the use of creams protecting against sunlight to be judicious&lt;/strong> .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Melanoma less likely when far from equator</title><link>/posts/melanoma-less-likely-when-far-from-equator.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/melanoma-less-likely-when-far-from-equator.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="biologically-efficient-solar-radiation">Biologically efficient solar radiation:&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Solar UV (UV) radiation is the main source of vitamin D production and is also the most important environmental risk factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) development. In the present study the relationship between daily or seasonal UV radiation doses and vitamin D status, dietary vitamin D intake and CMM incidence rates at different geographical latitudes were investigated. South-North gradients of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) generation and CMM induction were calculated, based on known action spectra, and compared with measured vitamin D levels and epidemiological data on CMM. The relative roles of UVA and UVB in CMM induction are discussed. Latitudinal dependencies of serum 25(OH)D levels and CMM incidence rates can only partly be explained by ambient UV doses. The UV sensitivity is obviously different for different populations. This is well known for CMM, but seems also to be true for vitamin D status. The fact that UV-induced vitamin D may reduce the risk of CMM complicates the discussion. To some extent high dietary vitamin D intake seems to compensate low UV doses.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indoor tanning not apparently associated with skin cancer</title><link>/posts/indoor-tanning-not-apparently-associated-with-skin-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/indoor-tanning-not-apparently-associated-with-skin-cancer.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Risk of skin cancer vs. risk of low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/risk-of-skin-cancer-vs-risk-of-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/risk-of-skin-cancer-vs-risk-of-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sunlight Vitamin D and Skin Cancer</title><link>/posts/sunlight-vitamin-d-and-skin-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sunlight-vitamin-d-and-skin-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry Volume 13 Issue 1 pp.83-97 (15)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today, there is a controversial debate in many scientific and public communities on how much sunlight is appropriate to balance between the positive and negative effects of solar UV-exposure. UV exposure undoubtedly causes DNA damage of skin cells and is a major environmental risk factor for all types of skin cancers. In geographic terms, living in parts of the world with increased erythemal UV or high average annual bright sun results in increased risks of skin cancers, with the greatest increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma, followed by basal cell carcinoma and then melanoma. On the other hand, sunlight exerts positive effects on human health, that are mediated in part via UV-B-mediated cutaneous photosynthesis of vitamin D. It has been estimated that at present, approximately 1 billion people worldwide are vitamin D-deficient or –insufficient. This epidemic causes serious health problems that are still widely under-recognized. Vitamin D deficiency leads to well documented problems for bone and muscle function. There are also associations between vitamin D-deficiency and increased incidence of and/or unfavourable outcome for a broad variety of independent diseases, including various types of malignancies (e.g. colon-, skin-, and breast cancer), autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, the present literature is analyzed to summarize our present knowledge about the important relationship of sunlight, vitamin D and skin cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Red-haired mice can get melanoma without UV</title><link>/posts/red-haired-mice-can-get-melanoma-without-uv.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/red-haired-mice-can-get-melanoma-without-uv.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="an-ultraviolet-radiation-independent-pathway-to-melanoma-carcinogenesis-in-the-red-hairfair-skin-background">An ultraviolet-radiation-independent pathway to melanoma carcinogenesis in the red hair/fair skin background&lt;/h2>
