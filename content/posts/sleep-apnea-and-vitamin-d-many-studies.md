#### Sleep Apnea (moderate & severe) associated with low vitamin D - meta-analysis Dec 2024

 **Serum 25(OH)D levels and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome severity in patients without comorbidities: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Sleep Breath. 2024 Dec 9;29(1):53. [doi: 10.1007/s11325-024-03167-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-024-03167-1)

Purpose: The aim of the present systematic review was to corroborate existing evidence on how serum25(OH)D levels affect obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) severity in the absence of comorbidities.

Methods: From inception to May 2024, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase electronic databases were systematically screened to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, prospective, and retrospective studies. A strict search protocol was applied following the application of PROSPERO, under the registration number CRD42023468744. The formulated question based on PICO process was: "how do serum25(OH)D levels affect the severity of OSAS or result in enhanced sleep function?". Collected results were finally reviewed for meta-analysis and quality assessment according to the ROBINS-I tool.

Results: Data from 24 studies were pooled and divided into 15 case-control studies and 9 cross-sectional studies. All studies involved a total of 2640 OSAS subjects and 933 healthy subjects. All studies underwent qualitative analysis whereas only 20 were collected for meta-analysis. Mild OSAS showed 25(OH)D levels non-statistically significant (P = 0.12) than the healthy patients whereas moderate OSAS (P = 0.004) and severe OSAS (P < 0.001) differed significantly from control groups. Meta-regression suggested that OSAS severity correlated inversely to the deficiency of 25(OH)D serum levels. Qualitative assessment and Egger's test revealed an elevated risk of bias but low presence of publication bias, respectively.

Conclusion: Serum levels of 25(OH)D were observed to be inversely proportional to OSAS severity in patients without coexisting morbidities. 25(OH)D levels in mild OSAS patients were not significantly different from non-OSAS patients, suggesting vitamin supplementation to improve potential sleep disorders.

#### Vitamin D Deficiency and Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity - Jan 2025

JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2025 Jan 1;151(1):72-77. [doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2024.3737](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2024.3737)  (available on 2025-10-31)

Andrew E Bluher 1 2, Timothy Kearney 3, Turaj Vazifedan 4, Cristina M Baldassari 5 6 7

Importance: Prior research has demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults; however, its association with pediatric OSA is emerging.

Objective: To evaluate the association of vitamin D levels with obstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) in children with OSA.

Design, settings, and participants: This was a cross-sectional study of children aged 2 to 16 years with severe obstructive OSA (AHI ≥20 on polysomnogram) who were undergoing adenotonsillectomy at a tertiary care pediatric otolaryngology clinic from 2017 to 2022. Age, sex, race, body mass index, history of asthma, and season were considered in the analyses. Data were analyzed from September 3, 2021, to October 8, 2021.

Main outcomes and measures: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were measured and assessed for correlation with polysomnography metrics. Fasting blood samples were collected and vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/mL.

Results: The consecutive sample included 72 patients (mean <span>[SD]</span> age, 6.7 <span>[3.9]</span> years; 34 <span>[47.2%]</span> females and 38 <span>[52.8%]</span> males). The mean (SD) AHI was 42.8 (25.5), and 35 participants (49.0%) had obesity. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 27 participants (37.5%). In univariate analysis, vitamin D deficiency was associated with younger age (difference, -5.0; 95% CI, -7.2 to -2.8), Black race (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 14.3), female sex (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 12.5), and higher obstructive AHI (difference, 13.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 26.4). In multivariable analysis, vitamin D deficiency remained significantly associated with AHI.  **A 1.0-unit decrease in serum 25(OH)D levels was associated with an AHI increase of 0.7 (95% CI, 0.04 to 1.40).** 

Conclusions: The findings of this cross-sectional study indicate that vitamin D deficiency was common in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for severe OSA and is significantly associated with increased OSA severity. Future research is needed on vitamin D supplementation and its association with any improvements in pediatric OSA treatment outcomes.

#### Sleep Apnea and Vitamin D Deficiency - Mercola interview Gominak Feb 2024

 **[86 minutes](https://www.bitchute.com/video/themPqUuQ0aC/) dual, connected epidemics: Low D, Sleep Apnea** 

 **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/interview-stashagominak-promotingsleepbyoptimizingvitamindlevels.pdf">Transcript </a>** 

Vitamin D is important for hibernation then should also be important for deep sleep

Vitamin D needed to stop movements  (needed for deep sleep)

She has helped >5,000 people

Fit bits are very good at monitoring deep sleep

Vitamin D levels of 60-80 ng are needed if you do not have good B vitamins (oral or gut)

B vitamins are very important - only need 40-60 ng of Vitamin D

B vitamins also made by [Microbiome](/categories/microbiome) - including gut

His notes on the video

* There’s a synergy between vitamin D deficiency and poor sleep, both of which are at epidemic proportions in many parts of the world.

* Lack of vitamin D causes impairment in your brain stem, which in turn can impair your sleep.

* Vitamin D is also a crucial component required to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that allows you to get “paralyzed” so that deep sleep can occur.

* B vitamins also play an important role in sleep. Ideally, you need to normalize your gut microbiome so that your gut bacteria make all the B vitamins your body and brain need.

* To normalize your gut microbiome, maintain a vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL or higher and take a B50 or B100 supplement for three months.

#### Review of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Vitamin D - Feb 2024

 **Exploring the link between vitamin D deficiency and obstructive sleep apnea: A comprehensive review** 

Review J Sleep Res . 2024 Feb 27:e14166. [doi: 10.1111/jsr.14166](https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.14166)

Despite the high prevalence and significant health burden of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), its underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. This comprehensive review explores the emerging connection between vitamin D deficiency and OSA, discusses potential mechanisms underlying this association, and explores the therapeutic implications of these findings. Recent research has consistently highlighted the high incidence of vitamin D deficiency among patients with OSA, which often occurs independently of geographical location. This suggests that factors beyond lack of sunlight exposure may be involved. This review also discusses how reduced vitamin D may be associated with more severe manifestations of OSA. In addition, it explores the potentiality of using vitamin D supplements as a therapeutic strategy for OSA, noting that some studies have found improvements in sleep quality and a reduction in OSA severity. Potential mechanisms are proposed, including the role of vitamin D deficiency in promoting inflammation, oxidative stress, hypoxia, impairing immune function, muscle function, and gene polymorphism of vitamin D receptors, all of which could contribute to the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. The paper underscores the need for future research to validate these observations, to determine optimal vitamin D supplementation dosage and duration, to explore potential side effects and risks, and to investigate potential interactions with other treatments.

#### Obstructive sleep apnea and vitamin D: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis – Sept 2023

Hormones (Athens). 2023 Sep 14. [doi: 10.1007/s42000-023-00481-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42000-023-00481-3)

Huai Heng Loh 1 2, Quan Hziung Lim 3, Waye Hann Kang 4, Anne Yee 5, Mei Ching Yong 6, Norlela Sukor 7 8

PURPOSE : Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, sleep-related breathing disorder which leads to increased cardiovascular risks. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with various cardiometabolic complications, including increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to analyze the difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level, prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, and the effect of CPAP treatment on serum 25-OHD levels among adult patients with OSA.

Methods: We pooled data from 18 observational studies involving 5592 individuals. Baseline parameters that might have contributed to the significant differences observed were also analyzed.

Results: Patients with OSA had significantly lower serum 25-OHD levels (pooled d + - 0.74 <span>[95% CI: - 1.19 to - 0.28]</span>, p < 0.01) and higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (pooled log (odds ratio) 0.98 <span>[95% CI: 0.30 to 1.67]</span>, p < 0.01) compared to those without OSA. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that these differences were significant only in moderate OSA and severe OSA. Neither age nor BMI nor geographical latitude contributed significantly to the differences observed in serum 25-OHD levels. The use of CPAP did not lead to significant changes in serum 25-OHD levels.

Conclusion: Patients with OSA have lower serum 25-OHD levels with a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, regardless of age or BMI, pointing to an independent association between vitamin D and OSA.

#### 26% of US has sleep apnea, but only 5% are aware that they have it - [Perplexity AI  Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-of-the-us-have-sleep-apne-Cbu.S4dQQDiJrmBGwM0S5g)

According to recent statistics, a significant portion of the US population suffers from sleep apnea, but many are unaware of their condition.

 **Prevalence of Sleep Apnea** 

Approximately 26% of Americans between the ages of 30 and 70 have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is the most common type&nbsp;[1](https://www.drugwatch.com/health/sleep-apnea/statistics/)&nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10706438/) This translates to about 30 million Americans having sleep apnea, according to the American Medical Association&nbsp;[1](https://www.drugwatch.com/health/sleep-apnea/statistics/)&nbsp;[7](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-sleep-apnea)

 **Awareness and Diagnosis** 

Despite the high prevalence, awareness and diagnosis rates are alarmingly low:

* Only about 5.3% of adults have been diagnosed with sleep apnea&nbsp;[2](https://www.sleepapnea.org/sleep-news/nearly-80-percent-of-adults-cannot-define-sleep-apnea/)

* At least 80% of people with the disorder haven't been diagnosed&nbsp;[1](https://www.drugwatch.com/health/sleep-apnea/statistics/)&nbsp;[7](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-sleep-apnea)

* It's estimated that 85% to 90% of people with sleep apnea don't know that they have it&nbsp;[6](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sleep-apnea-its-waaaay-more-common-than-you-think)

This means that out of the 30 million Americans with sleep apnea, only about 6 million are officially diagnosed&nbsp;[5](https://med.umn.edu/news/obstructive-sleep-apnea-hidden-health-crisis-america)&nbsp;[7](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-sleep-apnea) The vast majority remain unaware of their condition.

 **Factors Contributing to Low Awareness** 

Several factors contribute to the low awareness and diagnosis rates:

* Many people don't recognize symptoms like snoring or daytime sleepiness as signs of a disorder&nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10706438/)

* There's a general lack of knowledge about sleep apnea among the public. A survey found that 78.4% of adults who think they know what sleep apnea is were actually incorrect in their understanding&nbsp;[2](https://www.sleepapnea.org/sleep-news/nearly-80-percent-of-adults-cannot-define-sleep-apnea/)

*  **Even among those diagnosed, 40.3% have not tried or been prescribed any treatment** &nbsp;[2](https://www.sleepapnea.org/sleep-news/nearly-80-percent-of-adults-cannot-define-sleep-apnea/).

These statistics highlight the need for increased public education and awareness about sleep apnea, its symptoms, and its potential health consequences.
