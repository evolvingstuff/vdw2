#### [Wikipedia item](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning_lamp) mentions how the study of UV on sports resulted in creating Tanning Parlors

While studying the beneficial effects of **ultraviolet light on athletes** , German scientist Friedrich Wolff noticed an interesting side effect - tanned skin. 

Realizing the appeal of a beautiful tan, Wolff  **founded the indoor tanning industry** . 

His research led to development of indoor tanning equipment and lamp technology.

#### Happened to notice many professional black athletes had shaven heads or very short hair

##### Most likely that they have short hair due to being easier to move around quickly on the basketball court

##### However, if that were the only reason, the white players would also have very short hair, and they do not seem to.

#### Tendonitis and vitamin D on the web

* [TeondonitisExpert](http://www.tendonitisexpert.com/tendonitis-remedies.html) clips

   * The research overwhelmingly shows that Vitamin D  deficiency is the cause of an incredible amount of pain, disease, and physical dysfunction that we just consider to be normal these days.

   * One of the many possible symptoms of Vit D deficiency is random pain in the body. This can look exactly like Tendonitis...unless you know what you're looking for.

* [MedHelp](http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Orthopedics/Vitamin-D-A-Cure-for-Tendonitis/show/1142923)

   * Within the first 2 weeks the pain and tendonitis was gone from my shoulders
