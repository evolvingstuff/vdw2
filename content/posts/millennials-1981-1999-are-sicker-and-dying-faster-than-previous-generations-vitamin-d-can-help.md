* 40 % increase in mortality compared to Gen-Xers at the same age.

* Pay a third more in healthcare costs than the previous generation …(about $4,500)

   * Worse health and higher cost for the same treatment

* major generational difference can be chalked up to rapidly increasing “behavioral health” problems, or things like depression, hyperactivity (meaning anxiety, ADD, and ADHD), and substance abuse.

 **PDF Text snips** 

* “ **As millennials become less healthy, they are more likely to miss work or stop working altogether. Furthermore, even when they are working, health concerns may prevent them from being as productive as they would have been had they had the same health profile as previous generations.** ”

* “. Without intervention, millennials could feasibly see  **mortality rates climb more than 40%**  compared to Gen-Xers at the same age.”

* “Under the most adverse scenario, millennial treatment costs are projected to be as much as 33% higher than Gen-Xers experienced at a comparable age.”

* “lower levels of health alone could cost millennials more than $4,500 per year in real percapita incomes compared to similarly aged Gen-Xers.
