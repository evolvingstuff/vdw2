Background: Abnormalities in mineral metabolism are common complications of organ transplantation. The role of immunosuppressive agents in alteration of mineral metabolism is not clear. 

Methods: We conducted an animal study to investigate the effects of cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus, and sirolimus on renal calcium, magnesium and vitamin D metabolism. 

Results: 

* CsA and tacrolimus induced a 2- to 3-fold and 1.6- to 1.8-fold increase in urinary calcium and magnesium excretion, respectively, while 

* rapamycin had no effects on calcium, but doubled the urinary magnesium excretion. 

* CsA and tacrolimus, but not rapamycin, elevated serum 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D without affecting the parathyroid hormone level. 

* CsA and tacrolimus reduced mRNA abundance in TRPV5 (CsA: 64 ± 3% of control; tacrolimus: 50 ± 3%) calbindin-D28k (CsA: 62 ± 4%; tacrolimus: 43 ± 3%), and vitamin D receptor (CsA: 52 ± 3%; tacrolimus: 58 ± 2%, all p < 0.05). 

* Rapamycin did not affect gene expression in any of studied proteins. 

The immunofluorescence staining study demonstrated a 50% reduction of TRPV5 and calbindin-D28k by CsA and tacrolimus. 

Conclusion: The suppression of VDR by calcineurin inhibitors is probably the underlying mechanism of renal calcium wasting. In spite of an increased 1,25(OH)(2) vitamin D level, the kidney is not able to reserve calcium, suggesting a role of vitamin D resistance that may be related to bone loss.
