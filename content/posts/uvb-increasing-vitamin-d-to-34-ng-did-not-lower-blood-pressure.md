OBJECTIVES:

Recent epidemiological studies have reported inverse associations between vitamin D status and blood pressure. The study aim is to determine if exposure to ultraviolet B radiation, which synthesizes vitamin D, lowers blood pressure, compared with ultraviolet A radiation.

METHODS:

Men and women (n?=?119) with low vitamin D levels <span>[serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]</span> <50?nmol/l], completed a randomized clinical trial carried out during winter. Blood pressure was measured for 12-14?h with an ambulatory monitor at baseline and 12 weeks. In between, participants received 24 whole body exposures of either ultraviolet B (n?=?58) or ultraviolet A (n?=?61) over 12 weeks.

RESULTS:

Mean (SD) 25(OH)D increased from 

* 43.7 (9.7) to 92.6 (16.9) nmol/l in the ultraviolet B arm after 12 weeks, and from 

* 45.4 (9.2) to 64.9 (11.3) nmol/l in the ultraviolet A arm. 

However, mean blood pressure, which was similar for the ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A at baseline (134.9/79.2 vs. 132.9/77.8?mmHg; P?=?0.59 and 0.56, respectively), did not change from baseline to 12 weeks in either group. The mean change <span>[95% confidence interval (CI)]</span> in blood pressure over this period in the ultraviolet B group compared with the ultraviolet A group was -2.2 (-7.8, 3.3)?mmHg for systolic (P?=?0.42) and -2.7 (-6.5, 1.0)?mmHg for diastolic (P?=?0.15).

CONCLUSION:

Exposure to ultraviolet B did not lower blood pressure. Our results suggest that if vitamin D protects against cardiovascular disease, it involves some mechanism other than blood pressure.

# Strange

* UVA increased vitamin D levels from 18 ng to 26 ng

# Not Strange

* Increasing vitamin D levels from 17 ng to 34 ng did not change blood pressure

   * probably need at least 50 ng to make a difference
