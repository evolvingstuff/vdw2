* trial participants "had to start the drug regimen within five days of symptom onset and be  **un** vaccinated."

* " ... molnupiravir works by introducing genetic errors that garble the coronavirus’s genetic code. That means it may be more resistant to mutation, and may even work on other coronaviruses or RNA viruses."

* [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-starts-global-phase-23-epic-pep-study-novel-covid-19) is also developing an oral antiviral drug, and announced this week it was initiating a later-stage clinical trial testing the drug’s ability to prevent illness in people exposed to the coronavirus."

* "The Covid-19 treatment molnupiravir was developed using funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense."

* "Like the vast majority of medicines on the market, molnupiravir — which was originally investigated as a possible treatment for Venezuelan equine encephalitis — was developed using government funds"

* "Indian companies are planning to price the drug at less than $12 for a five-day course"

 **DoctorMurray.com email Oct 7, 2021 on Quercetin being better than molnupiravir** 

* "Quercetin is something else that I have highlighted as a treatment for COVID based on not only detailed studies showing an antiviral effect, but also clinical results from two trials."

* "These two published human clinical studies with an enhanced form of quercetin for improved absorption both produced better results than molnupiravir."

* "Quercetin cut hospitalization by 68%. And when patients did have to be hospitalized, the average stay was 6.77 days in the standard care group but only 1.57 days in the quercetin group. Quercetin not only reduced mortality by 100%, but also had a 100% success rate in preventing patients from entering the ICU."
