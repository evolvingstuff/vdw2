#### [Labcorp started offering the test in June 2016](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=84636&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2175307%20)

 **Current problems with Zika testing** 

1. Cost: $780

1. Hassle getting tested with no real benefit to the individual (no vaccine, etc)

1. Test only works in narrow time window

1. Accuracy was unstated – unknown % false positive and % false negatives

>  **False Positive**  (I guess = 10%) incorrectly told that you have Zika

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Malaria infections can produce false-positives

>  **False Negative**  (I guess = 10%) incorrectly told that you DO NOT have Zika

> &nbsp; &nbsp; test was taken too early or too late

 **Note: I sent them an email asking about cost and test accuracy - they declined to comment on test accuracy**

#### Note: Cocaine field tests have false positives of 10% to 30% – yet continue to put people in prison 40 years later

* " By our estimate, though, every year at least 100,000 people nationwide plead guilty to drug-possession charges that rely on field-test results as evidence. At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions."
