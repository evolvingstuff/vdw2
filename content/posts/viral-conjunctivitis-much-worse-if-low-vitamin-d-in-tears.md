Purpose: 

To determine the association between systemic vitamin D (VD) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels with severity and ocular surface inflammatory profile in patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC).

Methods: 

210 eyes of 105 patients who were clinically diagnosed with EKC were included in the study. The levels of serum VD and serum IgE were measured. Schirmer’s strip-based tear fluid (TF) was used to determine levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNFα, MMP9, sICAM1, and VEGF-A in a subset of patients.

Results: 

Levels of VD were significantly (P < 0.05) lower and levels of IgE were significantly higher in patients with severe forms of conjunctivitis compared to those with nonsevere forms. Majority of the patients with severe forms of the disease exhibited VD deficiency and/or abnormally high IgE. A negative correlation (r = –0.682; P < 0.0001) was observed between VD and IgE levels. TF levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and sICAM1 were significantly higher in eyes with severe forms of conjunctivitis compared to those with nonsevere forms and controls. These factors showed a positive correlation (P < 0.05) with IgE levels and a negative correlation (P < 0.05) with VD levels.

Conclusion: 

Patients with severe forms of EKC exhibited VD deficiency and higher levels of IgE. Increased TF inflammatory factors demonstrated a disease causal relationship with VD and IgE. Hence, restoring the altered levels of VD and IgE to normal range would be pivotal in the prevention and management of severe conjunctivitis.
