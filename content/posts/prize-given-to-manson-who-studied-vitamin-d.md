## A comment there by Cordell:

Sadly,  **Dr. Manson’s**  study does not appear to control for  **magnesium deficiency**  which, as suggested above, is just as bad for health as too little vitamin D3. Nor does the study measure calcitriol levels which can be low despite adequate vitamin D3 levels, as among the elderly and type 2 diabetics. This will bias the results against vitamin D3 supplementation. Overall,  **Dr. Manson’s**  study is seriously flawed and will only produce greater confusion rather than enlightenment on this important matter of vitamin D3 supplementation.

# Note: She was on the IOM committee which, at the end of Nov 2010 did not raise vitamin D recommendations very much - perhaps because it would have stopped her studies.
