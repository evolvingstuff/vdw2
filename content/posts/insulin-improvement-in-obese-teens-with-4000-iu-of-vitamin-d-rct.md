BACKGROUND: Obese adolescents are at a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency because vitamin D is thought to be sequestered by excess adipose tissue. Poor vitamin D status has been associated with a higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, or both in adults and adolescents.

Objective: The objective was to determine in obese adolescents the efficacy and safety of 4000 IU vitamin D(3)/d and whether subsequent increased circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> are associated with improved markers of insulin sensitivity and resistance and reduced inflammation. 

DESIGN: Obese adolescent patients [n = 35; mean ± SD age: 14.1 ± 2.8 y; BMI (in kg/m(2)): 39.8 ± 6.1; 25(OH)D: 19.6 ± 7.1 ng/mL](n%20=%2035;%20mean%20±%20SD%20age:%2014.1%20±%202.8%20y;%20BMI%20(in%20kg/m(2)):%2039.8%20±%206.1;%2025(OH)D:%2019.6%20±%207.1%20ng/mL) were recruited from the University of Missouri Adolescent Diabetes and Obesity Clinic and were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D(3) (4000 IU/d) or placebo as part of their standard care. Anthropometric measurements, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, C-reactive protein), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR values were measured at baseline and at 2 follow-up visits (3 and 6 mo).

Results: After 6 mo, there were no significant differences in BMI, serum inflammatory markers, or plasma glucose concentrations between groups. 

Participants supplemented with vitamin D(3) had increases in 

* serum 25(OH)D concentrations (19.5 compared with 2.8 ng/mL for placebo; P < 0.001), 

* fasting insulin (-6.5 compared with +1.2 μU/mL for placebo; P = 0.026), 

* HOMA-IR (-1.363 compared with +0.27 for placebo; P = 0.033), and 

* Leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (-1.41 compared with +0.10 for placebo; P = 0.045). 

Inflammatory markers remained unchanged.

Conclusion: The correction of poor vitamin D status through dietary supplementation may be an effective addition to the standard treatment of obesity and its associated insulin resistance. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00994396.
