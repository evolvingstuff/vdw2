Vitamin D status is of interest to physicians caring for patients in poor general health. The tool for assessing vitamin D status is the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration. Based on clinical trials and epidemiology the low end of the desirable concentration of this analyte generally ranges from 50 nmol/L to 75 nmol/L. Based on clinical trials, the high end of the safe concentration for 25(OH)D is at about 225 nmol/L, with an unspecified margin of safety beyond that. 

In the absence of sunlight, 225 nmol/L is achieved with prolonged consumption of about  **10,000 IU/day**  (250 ?g/day) of vitamin D3. 

Hence that intake should be regarded as safe, and in the absence of sunshine, comparable vitamin D-wise to abundant sun exposure. 

 **Government policy is very conservative** , and consequently, the latest advice from the Institute of Medicine for Canada and the USA specifies that in the absence of sunshine, a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 600 IU/day (15 ?g/day) of vitamin D will provide a serum 25(OH)D concentration of at least 50 nmol/L. 

Dietary-vitamin D-intake statistics for adult populations show that average intakes from food and supplements are 200–400 IU/day (5–10 ?g/day), respectively. 

Therefore,  **adult populations are consuming vitamin D in amounts far below the RDA** . 

 **Even if adults were to consume the RDA for vitamin D, it would still not be enough to ensure 25(OH)D >?50 nmol/L.** 

The implication of all these things for the clinical laboratory is that there will continue to be a demand for 25(OH)D measurements for many years to come.
