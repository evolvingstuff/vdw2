#### Disparity in cholecalciferol content of commercial preparations available in India.

Indian J Endocrinol Metab. 2013 Nov;17(6):1100-3. [doi: 10.4103/2230-8210.122638.](https://doi.org/10.4103/2230-8210.122638.)

BACKGROUND: High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been reported throughout the India for all age groups. Increased awareness about VDD among treating physicians has led to increased prescriptions of vitamin D preparations. Based on our experience of varied clinical and radiological response with different vitamin D formulations, we decided to assess cholecalciferol content of commonly available vitamin D formulations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured cholecalciferol content of 14 commercial preparations (two in the form of tablets and 12 as sachet) available in Indian market. Lab analysis was carried out in Shriram Institute for Industrial Research by high-performance liquid chromatography.

RESULTS: Of the total 14 samples analyzed only 4 (28.57%) were found to be within the acceptable ranges from -90 to +125% as defined by Indian Pharmacopia while 5 (35.7%) had higher and 5 (35.7%) had lower than the acceptable range. The percentage variation in cholecalciferol content as observed from the printed ranged widely from -91% to +65%.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a high degree of variability in cholecalciferol content of commercial preparations available in the Indian pharmaceutical market. This variation has many clinical implications as it may lead both, under treatment as well as vitamin D toxicity.
