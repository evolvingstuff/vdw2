* [Smoking depression, etc. reduced by Vitamin D (bi-weekly, 50,000 IU) - RCT Dec 2021](/posts/smoking-depression-etc-reduced-by-vitamin-d-bi-weekly-50000-iu-rct)

 **Note - Magnesium and Omega-3 supplementation often provide similar benefits for the above health problems** 

Taking one 50,000 IU capsule of Vitamin D3 every two weeks will result in  80% of adults  bringing their blood levels to above 40 nanograms/ milliliter in 2-6 months, an optimal level   for good health.

You can take  50,000 IU pills daily in the first week and feel the benefits by the end of the week

&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling the benefits quickly greatly increases the likelihood that you will continue with supplementation

<span style="color:#F00;">✻</span>About 20% of adults are at  **high risk**  for Vitamin D deficiency: especially those who are obese, pregnant, shut-in, avoid the sun, have dark skin, are elderly, live far from the equator, or need to deal with an illness, injury, or surgery.  **They need at least 2 times more Vitamin D** .

 **A 50,000 IU capsule costs as little as 20 cents ($20 retail for a bottle of 100 capsules [Amazon US](http://www.amazon.com/Bio-Tech-D3-50-000-100-caps/dp/B000A0F2B2/ref=sr_1_1?tag=vdw-20) )**
