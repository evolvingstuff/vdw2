#### Xylitol reduced preterm births 40%, and cavities in their infants by 70% - Dec 2023

 **Xylitol and the Gateway Microbiome** 

 **[McCullogh Substack](https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/xylitol-and-the-gateway-microbiome?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1119676&post_id=140219879&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=ofo3r&utm_medium=email)** 

* "The oropharynx harbors thousands of bacteria and fungi that live in symbiosis with the human body. This is called the “gateway microbiome” since the nose and the mouth are the entry point for air, water, and food to the human body. "

* "Aagaard et al conducted a large clinical study using xylitol based chewing gum in pregnant women—the results were astonishing, a 24% reduction in pre-term birth. This may have occurred due to a lesser risk of febrile infections or other factors that trigger premature labor."

* "Isokangas et al, found the maternal intervention of chewing xylitol gum on a regular basis had lasting beneficial effects in the growing children **through age 5 years.**  "

* In children at the age of 5 years, the dental caries in the xylitol group (their mother) were  **reduced by about 70%**  as compared with that in the fluoride or chlorhexidine group.

#### Oral and Systemic Effects of Xylitol Consumption - May 2019

Caries Res (2019) 53 (5): 491–501. https://doi.org/10.1159/000499194

Recent results of randomized trials testing the efficacy of xylitol in caries prevention have been conflicting. This narrative review reveals the sources of discrepancy. The following databases were searched for the terms “xylitol” or “artificial sweeteners” restricted to the English language: PubMed, Web of Science, Evidenced-Based Medicine, Scopus, and the Cochrane database. In a separate search, the terms “dental caries” or “cariogenicity” or “glucosyltransferase” or “low glycemic” or “low insulinemic” or “dysbiosis” or “gut microbiome” were used and then combined. In section I, findings regarding the role of xylitol in dental caries prevention, the appropriateness of research methods, and the causes for potential biases are summarized. In section II, the systemic effects of xylitol on gut microbiota as well as low-glycemic/insulinogenic systemic effects are evaluated and summarized. The substitution of a carbonyl group with an alcohol radical in xylitol hinders its absorption and slowly releases sugar into the bloodstream. This quality of xylitol is beneficial for diabetic patients to maintain a constant glucose level. Although this quality of xylitol has been proven in in vitro and animal studies, it has yet to be proven in humans. Paradoxically, recent animal studies reported hyperglycemia and intestinal dysbiosis with artificial sweetener consumption. Upon careful inspection of evidence, it was revealed that these reports may be due to misinterpretation of original references or flaws in study methodology. Any systemic benefits of xylitol intake must be weighed in consideration with the well-established adverse gastrointestinal consequences. The contribution of xylitol to gut dysbiosis that may affect systemic immunity warrants further research.

#### Xylitol Chewing Gums reduced risk of dental caries by 3.7X - Dec 1995

 **Xylitol Chewing Gums and Caries Rates: A 40-month Cohort Study** 

J of Dental Research Volume 74, Issue 12 https://doi.org/10.1177/00220345950740121501

K.K. Makinen, C.A. Bennett, ...

Dental caries is a pandemic infectious disease which can affect the quality of life and consumes considerable health care resources. The chewing of xylitol, sorbitol, and even sugar gum has been suggested to reduce caries rates. No clinical study has simultaneously investigated the effectiveness of these gums when compared with a group receiving no chewing gum.

A 40-month double-blind cohort study on the relationship between the use of chewing gum and dental caries was performed in 1989-1993 in Belize, Central America. One thousand two hundred and seventy-seven subjects (mean age, 10.2 years) were assigned to nine treatment groups: one control group (no supervised gum use), four xylitol groups (range of supervised xylitol consumption: 4.3 to 9.0 g/day), 

* two xylitol-sorbitol groups (range of supervised consumption of total polyols: 8.0 to 9.7 g/day),

* one sorbitol group (supervised consumption: 9.0 g/day), and 

* one sucrose group (9.0 g/day). 

The gum use during school hours was supervised. Four calibrated dentists performed the caries registrations by means of a modified WHO procedure. The primary endpoint was the development of an unequivocal caries lesion on a non-cavitated tooth surface. 

Compared with the no-gum group, 

* sucrose gum usage resulted in a marginal increase in the caries rate (relative risk, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.49; p = 0.1128).

* Sorbitol gum significantly reduced caries rates (relative risk, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.92; p = 0.0074). 

The four xylitol gums were most effective in reducing caries rates, the most effective agent being a 

* 100% xylitol pellet gum (relative risk, **0.27** ; 95% confidence interval, 0.20 to 0.36; p = 0.0001). 

This gum was superior to any other gum (p < 0.01). The xylitol-sorbitol mixtures were less effective than xylitol, but they still reduced caries rates significantly compared with the no-gum group. DMFS analyses were consistent with these conclusions. The results suggest that systematic usage of polyol-based chewing gums reduces caries rates in young subjects, with xylitol gums being more effective than sorbitol gums.

Many diseases, including 

* caries, 

* chronic inflammatory diseases, 

* diabetes, and 

* obesity,

are associated with uncontrolled sugar consumption. Artificial sweeteners are commonly used in food and pharmaceutical industries as sugar substitutes for the prevention of several dental and body diseases; they also have a favorable impact on body weight as they may help to restrict simple sugar consumption. 

Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is commonly used as a sweetener.

It can be found naturally or artificially prepared mainly from plant materials chemically or by fermentation of hemicelluloses from agricultural biomass by yeast or bacteria strains. 

This polyol has a significant 

* antiplaque effect on teeth surface and

* can reduce the gingival inflammation;

it is being used as a preventive agent for dental caries due to decreasing the growth levels of pathogenic Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sangui at the very early stages. Xylitol can bind with calcium ion leading to consequent remineralization of teeth enamel

* it is also able to prevent osteoporosis. 

This polyol can treat 

* respiratory tract and middle ear diseases 

due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potential and prevent some diseases which cannot be cured through antibiotics or surgery. 

Xylitol can reduce 

* constipation, 

* diabetes, 

* obesity, and other body syndromes or illnesses;

it has also revealed its stimulating effect on 

* digestion and 

* immune system. 

However, it can produce some side effects such as irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea, nephrolithiasis, etc., when consumed in excessive amounts. Different vehicles are used for delivering the xylitol into the human body, but chewing gums occupy a leading position. The present review is devoted to comprehensive analyses of the positive and negative effects of this polyol on human health.

 **Key Points** 

* The health benefits of xylitol are not limited to oral hygiene.

* Xylitol efficiently stimulates the immune system, digestion, lipid and bone metabolism.

* Xylitol helps in glycemic and obesity control; reduces ear and respiratory infections.

* Xylitol treats diseases that cannot be cured through antibiotics or by surgery.

#### Effects of xylitol chewing gum and candies on the accumulation of dental plaque: a systematic review Review - Oct 2021

Clinical Oral Investigations. Volume 26, pages 119–129, (2022)

Eva Söderling & Kaisu Pienihäkkinen 

Objectives

A systematic review of published data was conducted with the aim of assessing the effects of xylitol consumption on the amount of dental plaque.

Materials and methods

Electronic and hand searches were performed to find clinical studies concerning the effects of xylitol chewing gum or candies on dental plaque. Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials published between 1971 and 2020 conducted in healthy subjects were included in the review.

Results

The initial search identified 424 xylitol articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, altogether 14 articles (16 studies) were reviewed. The review identified 12 of the total of 14 xylitol chewing gum studies as having fair or high quality. In 13 of the 14 chewing gum studies, xylitol gum decreased plaque accumulation. In six studies, xylitol gum chewing decreased plaque compared to sorbitol gum, and in three studies compared to gum base/no gum. In three fair-quality studies conducted with xylitol candies, plaque accumulation did not change.

Conclusions

Habitual xylitol gum chewing appears to show plaque-reducing effects that differ from those of sorbitol gum. This suggests specific effects for xylitol on plaque accumulation. Xylitol candies appear not to decrease plaque. The heterogeneity of the studies warrants further research.
