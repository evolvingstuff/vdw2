#### Association of Vitamin D Status and Acute Rhinosinusitis: Results From the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001–2006

Medicine: October 2015 - Volume 94 - Issue 40 - p e1447, [doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000001447](https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000001447)

Although vitamin D status may be a modifiable risk factor for various respiratory ailments, limited data exists regarding its role in sinonasal infections. Our goal was to investigate the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels with acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) in a large, nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized individuals from the United States.

In this cross-sectional study of individuals ≥17 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001–2006, we used multivariable regression analysis to investigate the association of 25OHD levels with ARS, 

while adjusting for 

* season, 

* demographics 

> (age, sex, race, and poverty-to-income ratio), and 

* clinical data 

> (smoking, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and neutropenia).

A total of 3921 individuals were included in our analyses. Median 25OHD level was 22 (interquartile range 16–28) ng/mL. Overall, 15.8% (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 14.4–17.7) of participants reported ARS within the 24 hours leading up to their survey participation. After adjusting for season, demographics, and clinical data, 25OHD levels were associated with ARS ( **odds ratio 0.88** , 95% CI 0.78–0.99 per 10 ng/mL). 

When vitamin D status was dichotomized, 25OHD levels <20 ng/mL were associated with 33% higher odds of ARS (odds ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.03–1.72) compared with levels ≥20 ng/mL.

Our analyses suggest that 25OHD levels are inversely associated with ARS. Randomized, controlled trials are warranted to determine the effect of optimizing vitamin D status on the risk of sinonasal infections.
