Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gamma herpes virus that infects B cells and induces their transformation into immortalized lymphoblasts that can grow as cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. EBNA-3 is a member of the EBNA-3-protein family that can regulate transcription of cellular and viral genes. The identification of EBNA-3 cellular partners and a study of its influence on cellular pathways are important for understanding the transforming action of the virus. In this work, we have identified the vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein as a binding partner of EBNA-3. We found that EBNA3 blocks the activation of VDR-dependent genes and protects LCLs against vitamin-D3-induced growth arrest and/or apoptosis. The presented data shed some light on the anti-apoptotic EBV program and the role of the EBNA-3-VDR interaction in the viral strategy.
