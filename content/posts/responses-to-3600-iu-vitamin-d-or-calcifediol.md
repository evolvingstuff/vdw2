Background/Aim: To analyze the concentration-time curves of single-dose oral 25(OH)D3 in comparison with vitamin D3 in healthy adults. 

Patients and Methods: The pharmacokinetics observed over two weeks after orally administering single 900 fig doses of vitamin D3 and 25( OH)D3 to six otherwise healthy vitamin D insufficient/deficient adults participating in a broader randomized, double-blind, crossover, single center trial was analyzed. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (H-37167). 

Results: Individual concentration-time curves revealed that vitamin D3 took longer than 25(OH)D3 to reach its maximal concentration after ingestion in five participants. After 25(OH)D3 ingestion, 25(OH)D3 reached its maximal concentration, dropped rapidly, and plateaued before starting to decrease slowly. There were observable inter-individual variations in the bioavailability of vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 and the pattern of changes in 25(OH)D3 concentration after their ingestion. 

Conclusion: Pharmacokinetics of 25(OH)D3 in comparison with vitamin D3 was illustrated and described in this study.

##### 2022 PDF conclusion

We reported the concentration-time curves of orally administered single dose of 900 |ag vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 in healthy adults.

We found that oral 25(OH)D3 

* was absorbed faster, 

* stayed longer in the circulation, and 

* caused a more rapid increase in serum 25(OH)D3 than oral vitamin D3. 

These results imply that 25(OH)D is absorbed via the enterohepatic system unlike vitamin D that is absorbed via lymphatic system. Therefore, oral 25(OH)D may be a useful choice of treatment in conditions that benefit from rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency such as symptomatic osteomalacia, hypocalcemia, or proximal muscle weakness due to severe vitamin D deficiency. In the concentration-time curves of 25(OH)D3, there is a somewhattext delayed increase in serum 25(OH)D3 level after its rapid peak, which may represent tissue re-equilibration of 25(OH)D3. Finally, we **text**  observed some inter-individual difference in the bioavailability of 25(OH)D3 in participants with otherwise similar bioavailability of vitamin D3.

##### 2022 study says vitamin D uses the lymph system, yet the intestinal lymph trunk transit time to Thoracic node is 1 day

* "Vitamin D is a non-polar and highly lipophilic substance that is easily incorporated into lipid bilayers. Due to its lipophilic character, the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin D takes place predominantly via the lymphatic pathway."

* "These results imply that 25(OH)D is absorbed via the enterohepatic system unlike vitamin D that is  **absorbed via lymphatic system** "

   * No references for either assertion

#### Their 2021 pilot study: All 18 had <30 ng, 37% had malabsorption, (but only 6 subjects were in the 2022 study - which were dropped?)

* Did the 2022 study drop those with High BMI, those with Malabsorptoon, or what?

 **A pilot-randomized, double-blind crossover trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of orally administered 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and vitamin D3 in healthy adults with differing BMI and in adults with intestinal malabsorption**
