##### The Feb 2024 study

 **Higher ultra processed foods intake is associated with low muscle mass in young to middle-aged adults: a cross-sectional NHANES study**

* 2Department of Hepatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China

Design: Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become a pressing global health concern, prompting investigations into their potential association with low muscle mass in adults.

Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 10,255 adults aged 20−59 years who participated in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) during cycles spanning from 2011 to 2018. The primary outcome, low muscle mass, was assessed using the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) definition, employing restricted cubic splines and weighted multivariate regression for analysis. Sensitivity analysis incorporated three other prevalent definitions to explore optimal cut points for muscle quality in the context of sarcopenia.

Results: The weighted prevalence of low muscle mass was 7.65%. Comparing the percentage of UPFs calories intake between individuals with normal and low muscle mass, the values were found to be similar (55.70 vs. 54.62%). Significantly linear associations were observed between UPFs consumption and low muscle mass (P for non-linear = 0.7915, P for total = 0.0117). Upon full adjustment for potential confounding factors, participants with the highest UPFs intake exhibited a 60% increased risk of low muscle mass (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.26, P for trend = 0.003) and a decrease in ALM/BMI (β = −0.0176, 95% CI: −0.0274 to −0.0077, P for trend = 0.003). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistency of these associations, except for the International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS) definition, where the observed association between the highest quartiles of UPFs (%Kcal) and low muscle mass did not attain statistical significance (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.87, P for trend = 0.082).

Conclusion: Our study underscores a significant linear association between higher UPFs consumption and an elevated risk of low muscle mass in adults. These findings emphasize the potential adverse impact of UPFs on muscle health and emphasize the need to address UPFs consumption as a modifiable risk factor in the context of sarcopenia.
