**In a nutshell:  Dr. Hollis claimed that DAILY vitamin D while nursing.** 

 **One RCT found that monthly Vitamin D was just as good while nursing** 

 **Another RCT found that monthly Vitamin D was BETTER while nursing** 

 **[Randomized Controlled Trials found that Vitamin D every two weeks prevented or treated 22 health problems](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)** 

 **The survivors of evolutionary pressure have adapted to temporary deficiencies, such as:** 

* Calories – famine, winter, . . 

* Vitamin D  - weeks of cloudy weather, winter

 **Survivors typically store necessities such as calories and Vitamin D in fatty tissue.** 

 **It seems very unlikely that breastmilk would require daily summer sunshine (or daily suppliments) to have healthy infants**

Context: There is no doubt that vitamin D must be activated to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D]</span> to achieve full biological activity or that many tissues participate in this activation process-be it endocrine or autocrine. We believe that not only is 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> important to tissue delivery for this activation process, but that intact vitamin D also has a pivotal role in this process.

Objective: In this review, evidence on the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system is presented and discussed in relation to vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) affinity, circulating half-lives and enzymatic transformations of vitamin D metabolites, and how these affect biological action in any given tissue.

Conclusions: Circulating vitamin D, the parent compound, likely plays an important physiological role with respect to the vitamin D endocrine/autocrine system, as a substrate in many tissues, not originally thought to be important. 

Based on emerging data from the laboratory, clinical trials, and data on circulating 25(OH)D amassed during many decades, it is likely that for the optimal functioning of these systems, significant vitamin D should be available, on a  **daily basis** , to ensure stable circulating concentrations, implying that variation in vitamin D dosing schedules could have profound effects on the outcomes of clinical trials because of the  **short circulating half-life of intact vitamin D.**
