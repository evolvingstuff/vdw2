The CG included schoolchildren who had negative results during a mass screening campaign for CD and were not diagnosed for T1D, according to RIDI Marche registry data, were considered for the purposes of this study. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 were considered as the parameters for evaluating vitamin D nutritional status, and the date of measurement was recorded to analyze vitamin D level seasonality. Vitamin D nutritional status was categorized as follows: severe deficiency (&lt;10 ng/mL), deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL), insufficiency (20-29 ng/mL), or sufficiency/adequacy (≥30 ng/mL). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the groups. The association of 25(OH)D levels with health conditions and seasonal differences of 25(OH)D levels was analyzed using a multiple linear regression model.</p><p>Results: The number of children enrolled for the present study was 393: 131 in the CG, 131 CD, 109 T1D, and 22 T1D&amp;CD. Significantly lower levels of vitamin D were displayed for children with CD, T1D, or both the diseases. Interestingly, severe vitamin D deficiency was detected in no children with CD, 1.5% of children in the CG, in 24.4% with T1D, and 31.8% with T1D&amp;CD (p &lt; 0.001). As expected, the CG children vitamin D levels were significantly influenced by seasonality. Contrarily, no seasonal differences were reported in children with CD, T1D, and T1D&amp;CD. Multiple regression analysis showed that children with T1D and T1D&amp;CD had lower 25(OH)D levels of 9.9 ng/mL (95% CI: 5.4; 14.5) and 14.4 ng/mL (95% CI: 6.2-22.7) compared to CG children (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusions: Our results showed low levels of vitamin D diagnosis of T1D, CD, and T1D&amp;CD; however, severe deficiency was only reported in children with T1D and T1D&amp;CD. More studies are needed to better understand the role of this deficiency in children newly diagnosed with CD and T1D.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/celiac-disease-and-type-1-diabetes-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=reasons-why-cd-may-not-be-outdoors-much---perplexity-ai-march-2024>Reasons why CD may not be outdoors much - Perplexity AI March 2024</h4><ul><li><p>&ldquo;&mldr;individuals with celiac disease may experience symptoms that could inhibit their physical activity, such as fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, and anemia.</p></li><li><p>These symptoms might make it more challenging for them to engage in outdoor activities.
