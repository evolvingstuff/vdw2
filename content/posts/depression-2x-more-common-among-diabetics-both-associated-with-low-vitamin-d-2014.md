Background and Aims: Recently, studies suggest vitamin D deficiency may be correlated with severity and frequency of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and depression. 

 **Prevalence of depression in diabetics is 2-3 times higher compared to non-diabetics** . 

We aimed to assess vitamin D status in T1D patients and patients with depression, and its relation to diabetes control.

Methods: This study was conducted in the summer of 2013, on 120 subjects, divided into 4 groups: 30 healthy controls, 30 patients with T1D, 30 with depression and 30 with both T1D and depression. MADRS scale was used for diagnosis of depression. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, FBS, 2hPG, and HbA1c were measured. 

Results: Vitamin D levels were found insufficient in the control group while being deficient in all patients (62.43+ 24.86 vs.23.37 + 18.14,16.35 + 12.58, 22.14 + 20.6 nmol/L respectively, p<0.001), but without significant difference between patient groups. 

Vitamin D was negatively correlated with FBS, 2hPG, HbA1c and MADRS score and positively correlated with weight and BMI. 

Depression, female gender and T1D were independent determinants for vitamin D level by multiple regression analysis.

Conclusion: Vitamin D status should be assessed in diabetics and in depression. Severe depression associated with poor control.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common non-communicable diseases globally. It is the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in most high-income countries and there is substantial evidence that it is epidemic in many economically developing and newly industrialized countries. Diabetes is undoubtedly one of the most challenging health problems in the 21st century 1.

Vitamin D deficiency is an important public health problem because of its great impact on bone metabolism and the possible implication on cardiovascular outcomes, diabetes, cancer and mortality 2.It was shown that vitamin D levels are suboptimal in adolescents and adults in many countries, especially in the Middle East and Asia where vitamin D deficiency appears to be highly prevalent 3. Better understanding of the physiological role of vitamin D system, in particular its potential effect on inflammatory and autoimmune conditions as well as on insulin secretion
