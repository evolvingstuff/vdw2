### Observation by Henry Lahore of VitaminDWiki Dec 2013

I am unaware of a single vitamin D clinical trial which used enough D for long enough that did not get great results.  

<!-- ~tc~ start trials ~/tc~ -->

 **Many Clinical Trials do not find a benefit bacause of one or more of the following:** 

1. Have used [too small a dose of vitamin D](/tags/too-small-a-dose-of-vitamin-d.html) (often < 1,100 IU) 

> Even larger dose needed if: 1) [obese](/tags/obese.html), 2) [poor gut](/tags/poor-gut.html), 3) sick (many diseases consume lots of vitamin D

1. Fails to have given vitamin D for too short of time (a few RCT lasted less than 5 weeks)

Fails to have given Vitamin D frequently enough. [At least every 2 months for D3)](/tags/at-least-every-2-months-for-d3.html) - and at least weekly for D2

> Note: Infrequent dosing also causes unbalancing of the body's chemistry

Fails to provide a [loading dose](/tags/loading-dose.html), or had too short a duration to restore the vitamin D levels

Fails to use D3 form, instead uses the [less effective D2 form](/tags/less-effective-d2-form.html)

1. Fails to have a health range of [Calcium](/tags/calcium.html) or other important [cofactors](/tags/cofactors.html) (especially for [bone-related trials](/posts/bone-health)

> Also, differences in Magnesium can result in 30% change in response to vitamin D

> Magnesium is dependant on water, food, supplements 

1. Fails to notice the pre-existing vitamin D levels - only those who are low will likely show a benefit

1. Fais to notice how/when the vitamin D was taken (which can change the response by as much as 2X)

1. Fais to reports on compliance (in one case 40% of the participants did not take the supplements consistantly)

 **Many Meta-Analysis do not find a benefit because one or more of the above reasons** 

* Many <span>[tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=82&sort_mode=created_desc]</span> average together ALL of the trials

> Imagine a story about a meta-analysis if aspirin were being introduced now.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There would be scores of RCT for aspirin not working with 3 mg doses

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There would be many RCT of aspirin not working with 30 mg doses

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There would be a few studies of aspirin WORKING with 300+ mg doses

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There would be many studies of small amounts of Willow bark (Vitamin D2 instead of Vitamin D3)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then were would be a meta-analysis of aspirin and Willow Bark

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-  **That meta-analysis would conclude that aspirin and bark do not work.** 

<!-- ~tc~ stop trials ~/tc~ -->

While about 200 RCTs will be published during 2014, I anticipate only adding 50 to the proofs table due to the reasons listed above

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, some trials will not get started due to lack of people willing to go for years with < 500 IU of vitamin D

Note: 95% of the proofs for vitamin D were published after the IoM stopped looking at data.
