This article aimed to present the Consensus of Ukrainian experts devoted to VDD management. Following the creation of the multidisciplinary Consensus group, consent on the formation process, drafting and fine-tuning of key recommendations, and two rounds of voting, 14 final recommendations were successfully voted upon. Despite a recent decrease in VDD preva­lence in Ukraine, we recommend raising awareness regarding VDD&rsquo;s importance and improving the strategies for its decline. We recommend screening the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in risk groups while maintaining a target concentration of 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/mL). We recommend prophylactic cholecalciferol supplementation (800-2000 IU/d for youthful healthy subjects, and 3000-5000 IU/d for subjects from the risk groups). For a VDD treatment, we recom­mend a short-term administration of increased doses of cholecalciferol (4000-10,000 IU/d) with 25(OH)D levels monitored after 4-12 weeks of treatment, followed by the use of maintenance doses. Additionally, we recommend assessing serum 25(OH)D levels before antiosteoporotic treatment and providing vitamin D and calcium supplementation throughout the full course of the antiosteoporotic therapy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ukrainian-consensus-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><h5 id=methodology-of-consensus-development>Methodology of Consensus Development</h5><p>The Consensus creation was performed by the multidisciplinary expert group consist­ing of 15 leading Ukrainian scientists who have extensive experience in studying vitamin D and related topics. The 1st (N.G.), 6th (N.D.), and 11th (V.O.) authors of this article were members of the Task Force group who coordinated the experts&rsquo; work. Based on careful analysis of the current literature with a high level of evidence, the Task Force members formulated 14 recommendations regarding VDD epidemiology, its screening, prevention, therapy, and monitoring. Following the agreement on the formation pro­cess of the Consensus between experts, the <strong>Delphi method</strong> , which is widely used for guideline creation <sup>[23,24]</sup>, was chosen. The voting was performed on the SurveyMonkey® (<a href=https://www.surveymonkey.com>https://www.surveymonkey.com</a>, San Mateo, CA, USA) platform using 9-point grading of agreement with the recommendations (1—strongly disagree, 3—disagree, 5—neutral, 7—agree, and 9—strongly agree). Before voting, the experts agreed that Consensus would be achieved when more than 75% of the experts were in agreement with a recommendation on a voting scale of 7 points or higher. Otherwise, voting was to be repeated after the experts&rsquo; discussion and modification of the recommendation.</p><p>Two rounds of voting regarding each recommendation were held. The final Consensus recommendations are presented in the text of the article with their justification based on the current evidence before each recommendation.</p><p>Full version of the Consensus was presented for the first time in &ldquo;Pain, Joints, Spine&rdquo;

The treatment duration should be 4-12 weeks depending on the severity of VDD and other risk factors and should be continued until the target serum 25(OH)D level (75-125 nmol/L or 30-50 ng/mL) is reached. Afterward, we recommend using lower doses of cholecalciferol (800-2000 lU/d) to maintain optimal vitamin D status.</p><h5 id=13-only-use-active-vitamin-d-for-chronic-hyperparathyroidism-or-ckd-bone-problems>13 Only use active vitamin D for chronic hyperparathyroidism or CKD Bone problems</h5><p><span>[CVS (AL): 9 (60%), 7 (27%), 5 (13%)]</span>: We do not recommend active vitamin D metabolites for the treatment of VDD in subjects without diseases and conditions that affect vitamin D metabolism, however, we recommend them for the treatment of VDD in patients with chronic hyperparathyroidism or bone and mineral disorders associated with CKD.</p><h5 id=14-osteroporosis>14 Osteroporosis</h5><p><span>[CVS (AL): 9 (66.7%), 7 (26.7%), 5 (6.6%)]</span>: For patients with osteoporosis and its complications we recommend determining the serum 25(OH)D level before initiating antiosteoporotic therapy to improve its effectiveness and safety profile.</p><h5 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h5><p>Despite a recently decreased frequency of VDD in the Ukrainian population, the expert group recommends raising awareness among the medical and public community regarding VDD&rsquo;s importance and improving the strategies for its decline. We recommend screening the serum total 25(OH)D level in separate risk groups while maintaining a goal concentra­tion of 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/mL). Also, we recommend prophylactic cholecalciferol prescription (800-2000 IU/d for young, healthy subjects, and 3000-5000 IU/d for persons with diseases or conditions with negative effects on vitamin D metabolism). For the VDD treatment, the expert group recommends the short-term administration of higher cholecal­ciferol doses (4000-10,000 IU/d) with monitoring of 25(OH)D levels after 4-12 weeks of treatment, followed by the use of maintenance doses. Furthermore, we recommend the assessment of serum 25(OH)D levels before initiating therapy in patients with osteoporo­sis and providing a prescription of cholecalciferol (800-2000 IU/d) in combination with calcium (1000 mg/d of elemental calcium) throughout the full course of antiosteoporotic treatment (Table A1).</p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384336"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384336",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384336"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384336"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384336"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384336"></script></body></html>
