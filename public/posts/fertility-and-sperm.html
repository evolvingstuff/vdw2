Recent evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in improving reproductive outcomes is inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation could improve the reproductive outcomes of infertile patients and evaluate how the parameters of vitamin D supplementation affected the clinical pregnancy rate.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We searched seven electronic databases (CNKI, Cqvip, Wanfang, PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library) up to March 2022. Randomized and cohort studies were collected to assess the reproductive outcomes difference between the intervention (vitamin D) vs. the control (placebo or none). Mantel-Haenszel random effects models were used. Effects were reported as odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI). PROSPERO database registration number: CRD42022304018.</p><p>Results</p><p>Twelve eligible studies (n = 2352) were included: 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs, n = 1677) and 3 cohort studies (n = 675). Pooled results indicated that infertile women treated with vitamin D had a significantly increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with the control group (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.24–2.34; I2 = 63%, P = 0.001). However, the implantation, biochemical pregnancy, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates had no significant difference (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.00–3.47; I2 = 85%, P = 0.05; OR: 1.49; 0.98–2.26; I2 = 63%, P = 0.06; OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.63–1.53; I2 = 0%, P = 0.94 and OR: 3.64, 95% CI: 0.58–11.98; I2 = 68%, P = 0.21). The improvement of clinical pregnancy rate in the intervention group was influenced by the vitamin D level of patients, drug type, the total vitamin D dosage, the duration, administration frequency, and daily dosage of vitamin D supplementation. The infertile women (vitamin D level &lt; 30 ng/mL) treated with the multicomponent drugs including vitamin D (10,000–50,000 IU or 50,000–500,000 IU), or got vitamin D 1000–10,000 IU daily, lasting for 30–60 days could achieve better pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis systematically investigated that moderate daily dosing of vitamin D supplementation could improve the clinical pregnancy rate of infertile women and reported the effects of vitamin D supplementation parameters on pregnancy outcomes. A larger sample size and high-quality RCTs are necessary to optimize the parameters of vitamin D supplementation to help more infertile patients benefit from this therapy.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/d-decrease-infertility---meta-analysis-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=improved-male-fertility-if-increased-vitamin-d-andor-calcium---dec-2023-calcium-and-vitamin-d-homoeostasis-in-male-fertility-proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society-page-1-of-14doi101017s002966512300486x>Improved male fertility if increased Vitamin D and/or Calcium - Dec 2023** Calcium and vitamin D homoeostasis in male fertility **Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, Page 1 of 14 doi:10.1017/S002966512300486X</h4><p>Sam Kafai Yahyavi1,2, Ida Marie Boisen1,2, Zhihui Cui1,2, Mads Joon Jorsal1,2, Ireen Kooij1,2,</p><p>Rune Holt1,2, Anders Juul3,4,5 and Martin Blomberg Jensen1,2</p><p>Calcium and vitamin D have well-established roles in maintaining calcium balance and bone health. Decades of research in human subjects and animals have revealed that calcium and vitamin D also have effects on many other organs including male reproductive organs. The presence of calcium-sensing receptor, vitamin D receptor, vitamin D activating and inacti­vating enzymes and calcium channels in the testes, male reproductive tract and human spermatozoa suggests that vitamin D and calcium may modify male reproductive function. Functional animal models have shown that vitamin D deficiency in male rodents leads to a decrease in successful mating and fewer pregnancies, often caused by impaired sperm motil­ity and poor sperm morphology. Human studies have to a lesser extent validated these findings; however, newer studies suggest a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on semen quality in cases with vitamin D deficiency, which highlights the need for initiatives to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Calcium channels in male reproductive organs and sperm­atozoa contribute to the regulation of sperm motility and capacitation, both essential for successful fertilisation, which supports a need to avoid calcium deficiency. Studies have demonstrated that vitamin D, as a regulator of calcium homoeostasis, influences calcium influx in the testis and spermatozoa. Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between vitamin D deficiency and male infertility, although further investigation is needed to estab­lish a definitive causal relationship. Understanding the interplay between vitamin D, calcium and male reproductive health may open new avenues for improving fertility outcomes in men.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;20&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/calcium-and-vitamin-d-homeostasis-in-male-fertilit-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-is-significantly-associated-with-male-fertility-and-sperm-quality---meta-analyses-2019-and-2023-the-association-between-serum-vitamin-d-fertility-and-semen-quality-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis---nov-2019-international-journal-of-surgery-vol-71-nov-2019-pages-101-109httpsdoiorg101016jijsu201909025httpsdoiorg101016jijsu201909025-free-pdf-the-association-between-serum-vitamin-d-levels-and-male-fertility-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis---aug-2023-andrologia-vol-2023--article-id-9002938--httpsdoiorg10115520239002938httpsdoiorg10115520239002938-free-pdf>Vitamin D is significantly associated with male fertility and sperm quality - meta-analyses 2019 and 2023** The association between serum vitamin D, fertility and semen quality: A systematic review and meta-analysis - Nov 2019 <strong>International Journal of Surgery Vol 71, Nov 2019, Pages 101-109<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2019.09.025>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2019.09.025</a> FREE PDF</strong> The Association between Serum Vitamin D Levels and Male Fertility: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - Aug 2023 **Andrologia Vol 2023 | Article ID 9002938 | <a href=https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9002938>https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9002938</a> FREE PDF</h4><hr><h4 id=600000-iu-of-vitamin-d-a-few-weeks-for-women-before-ivf-did-not-help---rct-april-2021-single-oral-dose-of-vitamin-d3-supplementation-prior-to-in-vitro-fertilization-and-embryo-transfer-in-normal-weight-women-the-sundro-randomized-controlled-trial-american-journal-of-obstetrics-and-gynecology-httpsdoiorg101016jajog202104234>600,000 IU of vitamin D a few weeks for women before IVF did not help - RCT April 2021** Single oral dose of vitamin D3 supplementation prior to in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in normal weight women: the SUNDRO randomized controlled trial **American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.04.234>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.04.234</a></h4><p>Background: Improving in vitro fertilization (IVF) success is an unmet need. Observational studies suggested that women with deficient or insufficient vitamin D have lower chances of success, but whether supplementation improves clinical pregnancy rate is unclear.</p><p>Objective: To determine whether oral vitamin D3 supplementation may improve clinical pregnancy in women undergoing an IVF cycle</p><p>Study design: The SUNDRO trial is a two-centers randomized superiority double-blind placebo controlled trial. Subjects were recruited between October 2016 and January 2019. Participants were women aged 18-39 years with low vitamin D (peripheral 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt; 30 ng/ml), serum calcium ≥ 10.6 mg/dl, body-mass index (BMI) 18-25 Kg/m2, anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) levels > 0.5 ng/ml, starting their first, second, or third treatment cycle of conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The primary outcome was the cumulative clinical pregnancy rate per cycle. Pregnancies obtained with both fresh or frozen embryo transfers were included. Clinical pregnancy was defined as intrauterine gestational sac with viable fetus. The primary analysis was performed according to the intention to treat principle and could also include natural conceptions. Secondary outcomes included total dose of gonadotropins used, embryological variables (number of oocytes retrieved, number of suitable oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate and rate of top quality embryos) and clinical outcomes (miscarriage rate and live birth rate).</p><p>Results</p><p>630 women were randomized 2-12 weeks prior to initiate the IVF cycle to receive either a single dose of 600,000 IU of vitamin D3 (n=308) or placebo (n=322). One hundred thirteen (37%) and 130 (40%) women achieved a clinical pregnancy in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively (p=0.37). The risk ratio (RR) of clinical pregnancy in women receiving vitamin D3 was 0.91 (95% confidence interval-CI: 0.75 – 1.11). Compared to placebo, vitamin D3 supplementation did not significantly improve the secondary outcomes. Exploratory subgroup analyses for BMI, age, indication to IVF, ovarian reserve, interval between drug administration and initiation of the cycle and basal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D failed to highlight any clinical situation that could benefit from the supplementation.</p><p>Conclusions: In normal weight women with preserved ovarian reserve and low vitamin D levels undergoing IVF cycles, a single oral dose of 600,000 IU of vitamin D3 does not improve the chances of clinical pregnancy. Although the findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation to ameliorate IVF success, further studies are required to rule out milder but potentially still interesting benefits as well as exploring the effectiveness of alternative modalities of supplementation.</p><hr><h4 id=clinical-trial-of-50000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly-to-improve-ivf-success---phase-4-trial-announced-july-2017>Clinical trial of 50,000 IU vitamin D weekly to improve IVF success - Phase 4 trial announced July 2017</h4><p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03209856?rcv_d=14&amp;show_rss=Y">Vitamin D Supplementation in Vitamin Deficient Women Undergoing IVF Cycles: Does it Affect the Fertility Outcome?</a></p><p>Unfortunately trial is only giving vitamin D to the women, and for only 2 months</p><p>They will be measuring results over the next 12 months</p><p>Doubt that this clinical trial will be successful** <span style=color:#00f>50,000 IU bi-weekly to both man and woman during an entire year would have had far better success.</span> **&mdash;</p><h4 id=59-reduction-in-sperm-count-around-the-world-in-just-40-years---mercola-aug-2017-may-2022>59% reduction in sperm count around the world in just 40 years - Mercola Aug 2017.
