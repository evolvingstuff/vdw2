Background: Vitamin D has antineoplastic effects, but the synthesis of vitamin D requires ultraviolet radiation, a known risk factor for melanoma.

Objective: To investigate the correlations between serum vitamin D levels and risk and prognosis of melanoma.

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Online databases were searched on Oct 31, 2018.

Results: Twenty-five studies with a total of 11166 patients with melanoma were included. There was no significant difference in serum vitamin D levels between patients with melanoma and controls (standardized mean difference <span>[SMD]</span>, -0.185; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, -0.533-0.162). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly higher in patients with melanoma than that in controls (odds ratio,  **2.115** ; 95% CI, 1.151-3.885). In terms of prognosis, serum vitamin D levels were significantly higher in melanoma patients with lower Breslow thickness (â‰¦ 1 mm vs > 1 mm: SMD, 0.243; 95% CI, 0.160-0.327). 

Moreover, melanoma patients with lower vitamin D levels had a significantly  **higher mortality**  rate (hazard ratio,  **1.558** ; 95% CI, 1.258-1.931).

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher Breslow thickness and mortality in melanoma patients.
