Want to show that how many of the increased health problems are related to vitamin D deficiency

The following is a first cut at a summary

#### ||Health problem| % increase  
 in recent decade

Autism|800 %

ADHD|300 %

Rickets| 

Food allergies|260 % 

Asthma| 

Diabetes|40 % 

Obesity|30 % 

Multiple Sclerosis| 

Parkinson's Disease| 

Alzheimer's| 

Cancer - Melanoma|80 %

Cancers - child melanoma|24 %

Cancers- child brain|10 %

Cancer - Breast|50 %

C-Section|40 %

ALS Deaths|60 %

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Vitamin D</span>**  < 10ng Adult|130 %

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Vitamin D</span>**  < 10ng Black|270 %

Perhaps I should augment the table with the strength of the association of vitamin D with each disease.   

Strengths of A, B, C: (with different than typical definitions)

&nbsp; &nbsp;  A (RCT have proven that vitamin D supplementation decreases the disease - prevent and/or treat)

&nbsp; &nbsp;    B (Many studies have found that adding vitamin D decreases the disease)

&nbsp; &nbsp;    C (Many studies have found that the disease is associated with low levels of vitamin D)

Some increases associated with elderly  (Alz, Park, etc) must be adjusted for % of the population at that age

There are lots of theories as to what is causing each of the problems

- such as: pollution, injections, GMO, sugar, calories, pesticides, poorer nutrition, smoking, being indoors playing video games,  

 **Need to avoid contracting "The Panacea Paradox".**  

Almost universally, people are convinced that if something is too good to be true, then it should not be believed and is treated as false.  So, when we encounter a situation in nature like vitamin D, people tune out when the claims become too numerous. Even as an increasing body of evidence points to a small number of highly prevalent deficiencies being required for the expression of many of our most common disorders,  this universal disbelief kicks in...  invalidating the science rather than embracing it.  It is because people feel safer and more protected when they are more skeptical than open-minded. 

 **It might be possible to side step the Panacea Paradox by** 

Vitamin D has influences many body processes like hormones do.

or - Vitamin D is similar to hormones in acting on many body processes.

(Most people are very aware of the power of hormones)  perhaps provide a link to <a href="/posts/sunshine-superhormone-overview-2010" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Sunshine Superhormone - Overview 2010">Sunshine Superhormone - Overview 2010</a>

But, all of the health problems in the table are assocated with low levels of vitamin D.

And, sometimes the relationship has been proven, that is, increasing vitamin D decreases the health problem (prevention and/or treatment)
