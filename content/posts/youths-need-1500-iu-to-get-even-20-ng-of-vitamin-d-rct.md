Background:

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) dietary guidelines for vitamin D are based on limited pediatric data. Our objective was to estimate the dietary vitamin D requirements for maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations at the various IOM-considered thresholds of vitamin D status (12, 16, and 20 ng/mL) during fall and winter in children.

Methods:

Ninety-six healthy 8- to 14-yr-old Pittsburgh-area black and white children enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 1000 IU daily for 6 months with baseline and 2 month follow-up assessments completed during October through April were studied. Vitamin D intake from diet and study supplement adjusted for adherence and serum 25(OH)D were measured.

Results:

The vitamin D intakes needed to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 12, 16, and 20 ng/mL in 90% of the children were 581, 1062, and 1543 IU/day, respectively. The estimated vitamin D intakes needed to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations at 20 ng/mL in 97.5% of the children was 2098 IU/day.

Conclusion:

Our data suggest that the current vitamin D recommended dietary allowance (RDA) (600 IU/day) is insufficient to cover the skeletal health needs of at least 50% of black and white children.
