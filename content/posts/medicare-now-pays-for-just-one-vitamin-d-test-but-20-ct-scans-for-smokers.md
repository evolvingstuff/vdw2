### [Medicare Coverage Will Now Include Annual Lung Cancer Screening of Smokers](http://dailysciencejournal.com/medicare-coverage-will-now-include-annual-lung-cancer-screening-smokers/21097/%20)

For people, between the ages 55 and 77 years, who have a smoking history, Medicare will be covering a low-dose CT-scan a year. Current smokers, those who quit smoking at least 15 years ago and those who had smoked at least a pack of cigarettes for 30 years are the beneficiaries of the policy.

‘’This is an important new Medicare  **preventive benefit**  since lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.’’

 **Cost of 20 years of testing** 

* $10,000 for Smoker ($500 each year)

* $100 for Vitamin D test ($100 – once per lifetime)

##### Medicare is paying 100X more for ''lung cancer prevention" than for preventing of scores of diseases by encouraging vitamin D supplementation.

##### Doctors are totally unable to learn about how much vitamin D a person needs when they are not able to test to see how much the patient has after supplementation.
