#### Vitamin D injection cleared 80% of palmoplantar warts (adding CO2 laser cured 90%) – May 2023

 **Comparative Study Among CO2 Laser, Intralesional Vitamin D3, and Combined Intralesional Vitamin D3 and CO2 Laser in Treatment of Palmoplantar Warts** 

Dermatol Surg. 2023 May 31. [doi: 10.1097/DSS.000000000000384](https://doi.org/10.1097/DSS.000000000000384)

Background: Many therapeutic modalities are used for palmoplantar warts; whether destructive, such as chemical cautery, electrocautery, cryocautery, surgical removal, and laser ablation, or immunotherapeutic, stimulating the immune system against the virus such as intralesional vitamin D3 injection.

Objective: To compare the efficacy of intralesional vitamin D injection combined with CO2 laser to the efficacy of either modality alone.

Patient and methods: Eighty age- and sex-matched patients with palmoplantar warts were divided into 4 groups: 

* Group A received intralesional vitamin D3 injections, 

* group B received ablative CO2 laser, 

* group C received CO2 laser and intralesional vitamin D3 injection, and 

* group D (control group) were injected intralesionally with normal saline. 

Assessment was performed clinically, photographically, and dermoscopically before and after treatment to evaluate the response, and then, another assessment was performed after 3 months to detect any recurrence.

Results: Complete clearance was seen in 

* 90% of cases in group C, in 

* 80% in group A, and in 

* 75% in group B 

with no statistically significant difference.

Conclusion: Intralesional vitamin D, CO2 laser, and the combination show comparable efficacy and recurrence rates. Intralesional vitamin D maybe a better option for people with a relative contraindication to CO2 laser.

BACKGROUND:

Verruca vulgaris (viral warts) is a fairly common condition with a plethora of treatment options having variable success rates. Recalcitrant warts are refractory to treatment with often disappointing response and high recurrence rates. Lately, treatment with intralesional injections has gained momentum due to its effectiveness in clearing warts by stimulating the cell-mediated immunity. Vitamin D, when applied topically, regulates epidermal cell proliferation and is involved in the formation of antimicrobial peptides. We have attempted to use vitamin D3 to exploit its reported action as an immunotherapeutic molecule in addition to its topical effects. To our knowledge, there are no reports of intralesional vitamin D3 injections used in the treatment of extragenital recalcitrant warts.

METHODS:

Sixty-four patients with recalcitrant warts of varying sizes and duration were included in the study. About 0.2- to 0.5-mL vitamin D3 solution (600,000 IU, 15 mg/mL) was injected to the base of the wart. A maximum of 5 warts were injected per session at 3-week intervals until resolution or for a maximum of 4 treatments. Patients were followed up for 6 months after the last injection to detect any recurrence.

RESULTS:

Sixty patients completed the study. Complete response was seen in 54 of 60 (90%), partial response in 4 of 60 (6.66%), and no response in 2 of 60 (3.33%). The average number of injections required to achieve a complete resolution was 3.66. Complete resolution of distant warts was noticed in all patients.

CONCLUSIONS:

Intralesional vitamin D3 is a safe, effective, and an inexpensive treatment option for recalcitrant warts.

Background: Cutaneous warts are treated primarily with destructive methods such as cryotherapy or electrocautery. These modalities of treatment are time-consuming and may be associated with scarring in multiple warts. Immunotherapy is emerging as a new modality of treatment which acts on enhancing cell-mediated immunity against human papillomavirus for clearance of both treated and distant warts. 

Aims: This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intralesional Vitamin D3 for the treatment of cutaneous warts. Materials and Methods: Patients with multiple warts were selected for immunotherapy. Vitamin D3 (0.2 ml, 15 mg/ml) was injected to the base of warts after injecting with lignocaine (0.2 ml, 20 mg/ml).  **The injections were repeated 2 weeks apart for a maximum of 4 sessions or until complete clearance, whichever was earlier** . A maximum of 2 warts were treated per session and patients were followed up for 6 months after the last injection.

Results: Forty-two patients with multiple warts were recruited for the study who completed the 6-month follow-up period and were available for analysis. Of these, 23 had palmoplantar warts, 18 had verruca vulgaris and 1 patient had filiform wart. In total,  **33 of 42 patients (78.57%) showed complete response** , 6 patients (14.28%) showed moderate response and three patients (7.14%) showed mild response. Recurrence was observed in one patient with the palmoplantar wart. No serious adverse effects were reported. Limitations: Lack of control group was the main drawback in our study. 

Conclusion: Intralesional Vitamin D3 is safe and effective for treatment of multiple cutaneous warts.

#### 67% of warts cleared by Vitamin D injections - Jan 2020

 **Comparative clinical study of the efficacy of intralesional MMR vaccine vs intralesional vitamin D injection in treatment of warts** 

Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology  https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.13272

Dalia R. Shaldoum MBBCh  Ghada F. R. Hassan MD  Eman H. El Maadawy MD  Gamal M. El‐Maghraby MD

Background: Many therapeutic modalities were reported for the treatment of warts; however, no single treatment is completely effective.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of intralesional injection of MMR vaccine vs vitamin D in treatment of warts.

Patients and Methods

A total of 60 patients were included in the study divided into two groups. Group A received intralesional MMR vaccine into largest wart, and group B received intralesional vitamin D3 into each lesion with maximum of five warts treated in one session. A maximum of six sessions was done every 3 weeks in both groups. Follow‐up was done for 6 months for any recurrence.

Results

In group A: complete response in 80%, partial response in 6.67%, minimal response in 6.67%, and no response in 6.67% of patients. About 60% of patients with multiple warts showed complete clearance of distant untreated warts.

In group B: complete response in 66.7%, partial response in 6.67%, minimal response in 20%, and no response in 6.67% of patients.

There was no significant difference between both groups. No recurrence was observed in both groups in the follow‐up period.

Conclusions

Immunotherapy by both intralesional MMR vaccine and vitamin D3 is simple, well‐tolerated, effective, and cost‐benefit modalities for the treatment of warts.

2 Post Graduate Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy, Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India

Background: Cutaneous warts are common benign skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus. Various treatment options are available for these but immunotherapy is becoming more and more popular over the past few years. It stimulates cell-mediated immunity causing clearance of warts. 

Aims and Objectives: The aim is to determine the role of intralesional vitamin D3 in the treatment of warts. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients with verruca vulgaris attending OPD were included. Around two to three warts were injected first with 0.2 mL of lignocaine (20 mg/mL). After a few minutes, the same warts were injected with 0.2 mL (4 U) of vitamin D3 (15 mg/mL). The injections were given2 weeks apart for a maximum of six sessions, and the patient was followed up 3 months after the last injection. 

Results: A total of 41 patients of cutaneous warts completed the study. 

* Complete clearance was seen in 27 (65.85%) patients, 

* partial response was seen in 11 (26.83%) patients, and three patients 

* (7.32%) showed no response at all. 

The mean number of injections required for complete response was four. Recurrence was seen in two patients (4.88%) and one patient had keloid formation at the sight of injection. 

Limitation: This is a small sample sized study and lacks a control group. 

Conclusion: Intralesional vitamin D3 is an effective treatment option for common warts.
