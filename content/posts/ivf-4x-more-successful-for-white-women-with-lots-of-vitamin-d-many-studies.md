#### Summary of IVF and Vitamin D - [Perplexity AI PRO Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-increasing-vitamin-d-leve-me.bg64VTrqZ.se8LN5ydQ)

 **Does increasing vitamin D levels in both the man and women decrease the need for IVF?   
&nbsp; &nbsp; Use the attached file and the web** 

Vitamin D plays a significant role in fertility for both men and women, 

potentially reducing the need for IVF treatments through several mechanisms:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Impact on Natural Fertility</span>** 

 **For Women:** 

* Each 1 ng increase in blood vitamin D levels increases fertility by 1% <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Women with sufficient vitamin D levels (>30 ng/mL) show significantly higher rates of natural conception <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Vitamin D deficiency is found in 67-85% of women with fertility issues [8](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1148556/full)

 **For Men:** 

* Vitamin D increases fertility in men by improving sperm quality and motility <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Calcium deficiency associated with low vitamin D can affect sperm motility and fertilization [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859949/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">IVF Success Rates</span>** 

When IVF is needed, vitamin D status significantly impacts outcomes:

 **Clinical Evidence:** 

* White women with sufficient vitamin D levels are 4X more likely to achieve pregnancy through IVF <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Live birth rates are 1.7X higher in vitamin D replete women undergoing IVF <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Women with sufficient vitamin D levels show 52.5% clinical pregnancy rates compared to 34.7% in those with insufficient levels <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Cost Considerations</span>** 

The financial implications are substantial:

* IVF costs at least $10,000 per cycle <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Vitamin D supplementation costs approximately $5 <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* 43% of US insurance plans do not cover any part of IVF treatment <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Recommendations</span>** 

 **Before Pursuing IVF:** 

* Both partners should achieve vitamin D sufficiency (>30 ng/mL) several months before attempting conception <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Supplementation should be maintained throughout the conception process <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

* Regular monitoring of vitamin D levels is recommended to maintain optimal fertility <span>[VDW-IVF]</span>

This evidence suggests that addressing vitamin D deficiency in both partners could potentially improve natural fertility and reduce the need for expensive IVF treatments.

 **Are there any studies on the impact of vitamin D levels on male fertility** 

Multiple studies have investigated the relationship between vitamin D and male fertility, revealing complex and sometimes contradictory findings:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Clinical Evidence</span>** 

 **Impact on Sperm Quality** 

* Vitamin D supplementation shows a positive effect on sperm motility, particularly progressive motility [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9412569/) [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36672602/)

* Men with vitamin D deficiency demonstrate significantly lower sperm motility compared to those with normal levels [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9412569/)

* Higher vitamin D levels correlate with better sperm morphology, though the relationship isn't always statistically significant [8](https://www.givelegacy.com/resources/vitamin-d-and-male-fertility/)

 **Pregnancy Outcomes** 

* In a study of 330 vitamin D-deficient men with fertility issues, those receiving vitamin D supplementation had higher natural pregnancy rates (7.3%) compared to the placebo group (2.4%) [7](https://sciencenews.dk/en/vitamin-d-affects-fertility-but-do-women-or-men-need-to-take-it)

* Men with oligozoospermia who received vitamin D supplementation showed nearly double the live birth rates (35.6%) compared to the placebo group (18.3%) [8](https://www.givelegacy.com/resources/vitamin-d-and-male-fertility/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Biological Mechanisms</span>** 

 **Testicular Function** 

* Vitamin D receptors and metabolizing enzymes are present in various reproductive tissues, including Sertoli cells, germ cells, and Leydig cells [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076312/)

* The testicular tissue can synthesize and degrade vitamin D independently from systemic vitamin D metabolism [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076312/)

 **Hormonal Effects** 

* Evidence regarding vitamin D's impact on testosterone levels remains inconclusive [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36672602/)

* Vitamin D may influence fertility through calcium homeostasis in reproductive tissues [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076312/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Recent Findings</span>** 

A 2024 study presents contrasting evidence:

* No significant association was found between vitamin D levels and male infertility or seminal fluid parameters [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618377/)

* The study recommends larger multi-center investigations for more definitive conclusions [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618377/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Laboratory Evidence</span>** 

Animal studies support vitamin D's role in fertility:

* Male rats with vitamin D deficiency showed 45-55% decreased successful mating rates [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9912266/)

* Vitamin D-deficient males exhibited lower testicular and epididymal sperm counts [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9912266/)

* Studies demonstrate vitamin D's involvement in ATP synthesis and sperm motility through the cAMP/PKA pathway [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9912266/)

#### IVF cycle 8X less successful if low vitamin D (Middle East) – Feb 2025

 **Vitamin D status, polymorphisms, and clinical outcomes in couples undergoing assisted reproductive technologies: exploring the role of 25(OH)D levels** 

Middle East Fertility Society Journal  Volume 30, article number 1, (2025)

Rana Jreij, Rania Jounblat, Youmna Mrad, Elie Hajj Moussa, Maria Abdallah, Chadi Fakih, Fadia Najjar & Aline Hamade 

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/ivf-no-8x.webp" alt="image" width="500">

Purpose

Vitamin D status has been recognized as an important factor in human health, and its relevance in the context of couples utilizing assisted reproductive technologies is of particular interest.

Methods

This study aimed to assess the levels of 25(OH)D by ELISA in the biological fluids (serum, semen, and follicular fluid) of 105 couples undergoing in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Additionally, the association among 3 vitamin D receptor polymorphisms (Apa1, Fok1, and Taq1) and vitamin D status, as well as the clinical pregnancy rate after in vitro fertilization, were investigated.

Results

The results revealed a high rate of hypovitaminosis in the women’s group. Furthermore, a significant difference was observed in the fertilization rate (P = 0.007). Correlations were found between Apa1 polymorphism and the number of collected oocytes (P = 0.014), the number of embryos (P = 0.001), the number of 2 pronuclear (P = 0.001), and the frequency of clinical pregnancies (P = 0.046). Additionally, correlations were found between Taq1 SNP and the number of embryos (P = 0.046) and the serum vitamin D level (P = 0.042). The Fok1 polymorphism showed correlations with semen concentration (P = 0.044) and clinical outcome (P = 0.032).

Conclusion

These results suggest the importance of systemic vitamin D for women prior to pregnancy. The findings emphasize the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in women before pregnancy and call for cautious interpretation of data regarding the impact of vitamin D on pregnancy.

#### IVF perhaps 2X average more successful if 36 ng of Vitamin D - May 2024

 **Association Between Vitamin D Level and Clinical Outcomes of Assisted Reproductive Treatment: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis** 

Reproductive Endocrinology: Review

The investigation about association between vitamin D level and clinical outcomes of assisted reproductive treatment showed various outcomes. This study aimed to review the correlation between vitamin D and outcomes of assisted reproductive treatment. The search was registered on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023458040). PubMed, Embase, Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane databases were searched up to July 2023. Twenty-three observational studies were selected for meta-analysis. Comparing groups with deficient and ‘insufficient + sufficient’ vitamin D level, meta-analysis showed positive correlation between clinical pregnancy rate and vitamin D (OR 0.81, 95%CI: 0.70, 0.95, P = 0.0001). Comparing groups with ‘deficient + insufficient’ and sufficient vitamin D level, meta-analysis showed positive correlation between vitamin D and clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.55, 0.91, P = 0.006), vitamin D and live birth rate (OR 0.69, 95%CI: 0.54, 0.89, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis did not show the source of high heterogeneity. No correlation was found in biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and implantation rate. In dose-response meta-analysis, a nonlinear association was found between vitamin D levels and outcomes when levels are below approximately 24 ng/L. The study shows that vitamin D level is associated with clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate. Low vitamin D level does not influence biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and implantation rate. Furthermore, 24 ng/L may be a possible threshold of vitamin D concentration in assisted reproduction therapy.

#### IVF women with good vitamin D were 1.7 X more likely to have a live birth - meta-analysis Aug 2020

 **Women’s vitamin D levels and IVF results: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis, considering three categories of vitamin status (replete, insufficient and deficient)**

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/increased-ivf-if-sufficient.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

To investigate the influence of vitamin D status on in vitro fertilisation (IVF) results, a meta-analysis of 15 cohort studies of 3711 women undergoing IVF was performed. Women were classified into three groups according their vitamin D levels (≥30 ng/mL considered replete/sufficient; 21–29 ng/mL insufficient and <20 ng/mL deficient). Three different meta-analyses were performed: (i) sufficient vs deficient; (ii) sufficient vs ‘insufficient + deficient’; (iii) ‘sufficient + insufficient’ vs deficient. Comparing IVF outcomes in sufficient versus deficient groups (considering autologous and donor oocyte cycles together), we found women with 

sufficient vitamin D had significantly higher 

* biochemical pregnancy (OR = 1.43 <span>[1.06–1.95]</span>), 

* ongoing pregnancy (OR = 1.29 <span>[1.02–1.64]</span>), and

* live birth (OR = 1.74 <span>[1.31–2.31]</span>) rates, 

with a non-significant trend to a higher clinical pregnancy rate (OR = 1.31 <span>[0.94–1.82]</span>), whereas implantation and miscarriage rates were similar. When the meta-analysis was restricted to autologous oocytes, the parameters which had been significant in the joint analysis remained significant, and differences in implantation (OR = 1.64, <span>[1.17–2.29]</span>) and clinical pregnancy (OR = 1.47 <span>[1.2–1.69]</span>) rates became significant. No significant differences were found when considering only cycles with donor oocytes. The sufficient + insufficient vs deficient and sufficient vs ‘insufficient + deficient’ comparisons identified significant differences in live birth rate. The meta-analysis shows that sufficient vitamin D status is associated with better outcomes in IVF. Nonetheless, there are many demographic, geographic and clinical parameters that may be related to vitamin D status that need to be ascertained before concluding that the better results are due to the higher levels of vitamin D.

BACKGROUND Vitamin D plays a role in reproductive capacity. Recently, several investigators have demonstrated higher IVF pregnancy rates in vitamin D replete women. The objective of this study was to validate these findings and to further elucidate the role of vitamin D in reproduction among a diverse group of women.

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study in an academic tertiary care center of 188 infertile women undergoing IVF. Serum levels of vitamin D (25OH-D) were measured in previously frozen serum samples. The main outcome measure was clinical pregnancy, defined as sonographic presence of a heartbeat following IVF.

RESULTS The relationship between vitamin D status and pregnancy rates differed by race (P < 0.01). Among non-Hispanic whites, pregnancy rates declined with progressively lower levels of vitamin D, while in Asians, the reverse was true. Adjusting for age and number and quality of embryos transferred among non-Hispanic whites, the odds of pregnancy were  **four times higher in vitamin D replete versus deficient patients** . Live birth rates mirrored pregnancy rates. Vitamin D status was not associated with ovarian stimulation parameters or with markers of embryo quality.

CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D deficiency is associated with lower pregnancy rates in non-Hispanic whites,  **but not in Asians, possibly due to their lower IVF success rates** . Vitamin D deficiency was not correlated with ovarian stimulation parameters or with markers of embryo quality, suggesting its effect may be mediated through the endometrium.

OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the role of vitamin D in reproduction by examining the relationship between recipient vitamin D levels and pregnancy rates in donor-recipient IVF cycles.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.

SETTING: Academic tertiary care center.

PATIENT(S): Ninety-nine recipients of egg donation at University of Southern California Fertility.

INTERVENTION(S): Serum was collected from egg donor recipients before ET and was tested for vitamin D levels <span>[25(OH)D]</span>.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical pregnancy as defined by sonographic presence of a heartbeat at 7-8 weeks of gestation.

RESULT(S): In a diverse population of 99 recipients (53% Caucasian, 20% Asian, 16% Hispanic, 7% African American), adjusted clinical pregnancy rates were lower among vitamin D-deficient recipients than among vitamin D-replete recipients ( **37% vs. 78%** ). 

Live-birth rates were  **31%**  among vitamin D-deficient recipients, compared with  **59%**  among vitamin D-replete recipients. There were no differences in adjusted clinical pregnancy and live-birth rates among recipients who were vitamin D deficient [25(OH)D<20 ng/mL](25(OH)D<20%20ng/mL) vs. among those who were vitamin D insufficient [20 ng/mL ≤ 25(OH)D<30 ng/mL](20%20ng/mL%20≤%2025(OH)D<30%20ng/mL).

CONCLUSION(S): Nonreplete vitamin D status [25(OH)D<30 ng/mL](25(OH)D<30%20ng/mL) was associated with lower pregnancy rates in recipients of egg donation. Since the oocyte donor-recipient model is able to separate the impact of vitamin D on oocyte vs. endometrium, these data suggest that the effects of vitamin D may be mediated through the endometrium.

BACKGROUND:

Recent studies suggest that vitamin D may play a role in human reproduction. Our goal was to investigate whether vitamin D levels are predictive of implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in infertile women following in vitro fertilization (IVF).

METHODS:

We prospectively evaluated vitamin D status, as determined by serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels, in a cohort of 173 women undergoing IVF at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario. Serum 25(OH)D samples were collected within 1 week before oocyte retrieval. We classified patients as having sufficient (≥ 75 nmol/L) or insufficient (or deficient; hereafter referred to as "insufficient"; < 75 nmol/L) serum levels of 25(OH)D. We compared patient demographics and IVF cycle parameters between groups. The primary outcome measure was clinical pregnancy (intrauterine sac visible on ultrasound performed 4-5 weeks after embryo transfer).

RESULTS:

Of the included women, 54.9% had insufficient 25(OH)D levels and 45.1% had sufficient levels. 

Women with sufficient levels had significantly higher rates of clinical pregnancy per IVF cycle started  **(52.5%)**  compared with women with insufficient levels  **(34.7%;**  p < 0.001).

Implantation rates were also higher in the sufficient 25(OH)D group, but the results were not statistically significant. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, body mass index and day 5 <span>[v. day 3]</span> embryo transfer) showed that serum 25(OH)D level may be a predictor of clinical pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.03).

INTERPRETATION:

Our findings suggest that women with sufficient levels of vitamin D are significantly more likely to achieve clinical pregnancy following IVF. Vitamin D supplementation could provide an easy and cost-effective way of improving pregnancy rates; this merits further investigation.

a IVI-Madrid, Rey Juan Carlos University, Madrid, Spain

b Nova IVI Fertility, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates

Objective: To investigate the correlation between total and bioavailable serum 25-OH vitamin D and the pregnancy rate in recipients of donated oocytes.

Design: Retrospective study.

Setting: University-affiliated private IVF center.

Patient(s): A total of 267 patients who were referred to our clinic for oocyte donation from June 2013 to December 2013.

Intervention(s): Serum analysis of vitamin D and bioavailable vitamin D and reproductive outcomes.

Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy and implantation rate.

Result(s):Among all patients, 15.3% (n = 41) were vitamin D replete (vitamin D >30 ng/mL), 50.2% (n = 134) had vitamin D deficiency (20–30 ng/mL), and 34.4% (n = 92) had insufficient vitamin D (<20 ng/mL). Implantation rates were similar among patients with normal, insufficient, or deficient total serum 25-OH vitamin D levels (61%, 63.4%, and 65.2%, respectively). 

 **Pregnancy rates did not differ among the three groups (70%, 69.9%, and 73.9%).** 

Ongoing pregnancy rates were also comparable among the three groups (55.9%, 52.7%, and 60.7%). 

The predictive value of total vitamin D regarding pregnancy rate was analyzed by the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.468. 

The AUC for bioavailable 25-OH vitamin D was 0.499, showing that the analysis of the AUC for vitamin D or bioavailable vitamin D was not informative.

Conclusion(s): Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are frequent conditions in our southern European infertile population. In contrast to previous studies, patients who are not vitamin D replete do not have a decreased chance of becoming pregnant with egg donation. 

Bioavailable 25-OH vitamin D, which is a better marker of the status than total 25-OH vitamin D, does not correlate with pregnancy rate in recipients of donated oocytes. 

Thus, at this stage, there is insufficient evidence to recommend vitamin D screening in patients undergoing egg donation.
