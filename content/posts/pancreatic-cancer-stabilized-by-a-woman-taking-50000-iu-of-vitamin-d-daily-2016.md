<div class="border" style="background-color:#FFFAE2;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:700px">

*  **A woman with pancreatic cancer decided from the internet to take 50,000 IU of vitamin D daily** 

* She got her Vitamin D  level to >150 ng

* 10 months later, without radiation therapy and with only one dose of Chemo she was well and without symptoms

* The researchers refered to her condition as "stabillized", but it seems more than stabilized, since her health improved

* The researchers were considering a trial for % "cured" with extremly high doses of vitamin D

   * No clinical trials listed for Pancreatic Cancer with >4,000 IU of Vitamin D as of June 2018, 2 years after publication of the study

   * Note The MS Vitamin D dosing (see below) needed to get to individuals to 150 ng ranged from 20,000 to 140,000 IU daily
