Dear Vitamin D Council Member,

We need your help! This summer, the Vitamin D Council is set to file a 17-page complaint against Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding their vitamin D food fortification policies and how they disparately afflict African Americans.

Through a combination of mandated and encouraged practices, the FDA depends upon milk to deliver virtually all supplemental dietary vitamin D to Americans. The FDA knows African Americans consume little milk, particularly relative to Caucasian Americans. The FDA, in effect, chooses to fortify a food that does not target a population who most need vitamin D.

Vitamin D is a hormone activated by sunlight. Due to their darker skin, African Americans require six to ten times the amount of sun exposure Caucasian Americans do to activate the same amount of vitamin D. In consequence, African Americans are much more likely to be deficient in vitamin D.

In effort to strengthen the complaint, the Vitamin D Council launched a petition today, seeking backing from citizens all across the country. Please sign our petition at http://www.change.org/petitions/back-health-equality-complaint-against-fda-2. Please email your friends and share this petition on your facebook. Help spread the word!

Hold the FDA accountable for their responsibility to set policies that encourage health equality for all Americans of all racial backgrounds. Please join us to call upon the FDA to mandate and encourage fortifying foods that African Americans are more likely and able to consume.

Sincerely, Vitamin D Council

The Honorable Eric H. Holder, Jr., U.S. Attorney General, Department of Justice

950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530-0001

The Vitamin  D Council  **Complainant** 

Vs Margaret Hamburg, M.D.,   In Her Official Capacity as Acting  Commissioner Of the United States Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)      **Defendant** .         

Violation of the Fifth   Amendment Violation of Human Rights 

Violation of Equal Protection Inadequate Vitamin D 

Supplementation under Title 21 of the Code Federal Regulations	Food and Drug  Administration

COMPLAINT REQUESTING DECLARATORY AND  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The Complainant, the Vitamin D Council,  hereby submits the following Complaint requesting you seek declaratory and mandatory injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706 and states:

## PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

1.	Vitamin D deficiency is associated with  over one-hundred health problems, not just osteoporosis.

2.	Vitamin D deficiency disparately afflicts African  Americans.

3.	The FDA knows African  Americans consume few milk products.

4.	The FDA knows that milk products are the main vehicle for vitamin D fortification. Through a combination of mandated and encouraged practices, the FDA depends upon milk to deliver virtually all supplemental dietary vitamin D to Americans. In fact, under Title 21 of the Code of Federal  Regulations, the FDA only mandates that vitamin D be fortified in nonfat fortified milk and evaporated milk.

5.	As a result  of the FDA?s policies, vitamin D deficiency and the diseases associated with this deficiency disparately afflicts African  Americans.

## JURISDICTION AND  VENUE

6.	The United States District  Court  for the District  of Columbia would have original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331

in that this action arises under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and the regulations of the FDA having the force of laws of the United States.

The cause of action would be for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

§§ 2201-2202, 5 U.S.C.  §§ 701-706, and 21 C.F.R. § 10.45.  Venue  in this judicial  district is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  §1391(e).

## PARTIES

7.	The Complainant is a not for profit  corporation whose  purpose is to research vitamin D related health issues and  to educate the public  and the professional community about  the occurrence of diseases and illness caused by vitamin D deficiency and the prevention and treatment of those conditions.

8.	The defendant would be Margaret Hamburg, M.D., Acting Commissioner of the FDA, an executive agency.   See 21 U.S.C. § 393.

9.	The Plaintiff  would be Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. of the United States Department of Justice in his capacity as chief law enforcement officer of the Federal Government.

## FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

10.	African  Americans, as compared to other  ethnic  or racial groups, bear a greatly increased risk of suffering and dying from numerous diseases, including heart disease, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. A review by Professor Lundy Braun of Brown University concluded, “Over  the past decade, numerous studies have documented profound racial and ethnic disparities in disease in the United States.” 1

11.	Medical  science has identified another condition that shows  a striking racial inequity: vitamin D deficiency. The world?s best known authority on vitamin D, Professor Michael  Holick of Boston University, wrote,  “Vitamin D deficiency is an unrecognized epidemic among both children and adults in the United States.” 2

12.	In 2003, the FDA?s own employees warned that vitamin D deficiency is common in the U.S. and “the prevalence of <span>[vitamin D deficiency]</span> in the United States is increasing.” 3

13.	More importantly, while the epidemic of vitamin D deficiency is problematic for all Americans, its incidence among African  Americans is close to universal. African  Americans are much  more likely to be vitamin D deficient than white  Americans. 4

14.	In 2003, an FDA employee warned the FDA that vitamin D deficiency was “an alarming two to eight times higher among blacks.”  5   A year later, the same FDA employee again warned the FDA that African  Americans are more likely to be vitamin D deficient than  whites. 6

15.	African  American women of childbearing age are **ten times more likely to be vitamin D deficient than white women.**  7  

In fact, many  African  American women of childbearing age have undetectable blood levels of Vitamin D; a startling fact when one considers that Vitamin D is crucial for optimal growth and development of the fetus. 8

16.	Dr. Kathleen Fuller, of the Center  for the Study  of Race and Ethnicity in Medicine of the University of Kansas  School of Medicine, noted that vitamin D deficiency in African  American mothers explains the fact that their **babies are more than twice as likely to be low-birth-weight**  as white  children. 9    

Furthermore, unless adequately supplemented, the breast  milk of most American women contains insufficient, often undetectable, levels of vitamin D, with African  Americans, again, being unequally impacted.  Professor Hollis and his colleagues at the Medical University of South Carolina also demonstrated that adequate maternal vitamin D supplementation can easily correct the vitamin D deficiencies of both the mother and the nursing infant.   10

17.	 **Eighty-three percent**  of all American children diagnosed with vitamin D deficient **rickets**  between the years of 1986 and 2003 were  **African  Americans** . 11

Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency is now unquestionably associated with diseases that disparately, and prematurely, end the lives of African  Americans. 

 **All of the major fatal illnesses  in the African  American community are linked with vitamin D deficiency** , including heart  disease, cancer, hypertension, kidney disease, and diabetes. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

18.	Again,  the FDA's own employee has warned the FDA about  the alarming associations of vitamin D deficiency with chronic  disease in the African American community.  Writing in 2003, Dr. Mona Calvo said,  **“In sharp contrast to their white  counterparts, blacks have a much  higher incidence and  mortality of certain types  of aggressive cancers  and autoimmune diseases, including diabetes that cannot be attributed entirely to socioeconomic differences or disparities in health care.**  The strong association between vitamin D insufficiency and risk of chronic  diseases should raise concern  about  the current mechanisms in place to prevent <span>[vitamin D deficiency]</span>.” 20

19.	Although named a vitamin, vitamin D is unlike any other vitamin. It is a prehormone normally made  in the skin by ultraviolet radiation from the sun.  Vitamin D is the body?s only source  of a potent steroid hormone, calcitriol.   Calcitriol works by regulating the genome; that is, it regulates the genetic  production of hundreds of proteins and enzymes in the human body.   Through its potent actions  on the human genome, calcitriol  is intimately involved with numerous and disparate biochemical and physiological processes, and thus  with a multitude of diseases. For a review of the physiology of vitamin D, and a growing list of diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency, see Holick.  21

20.	Unless they specifically avoid  the sun, European Americans can easily obtain  adequate vitamin D from sunlight. Such is not the case for African Americans who  **require six to ten times more sun exposure to produce adequate vitamin D** . 22

Therefore, with the average indoor American lifestyle taken  into account, supplementation through diet is crucial to the health of African  Americans. Furthermore, with the exception of some fish, significant amounts of vitamin D do not exist in the foods humans normally consume – unless  it is added through fortification. That is, if we do not (or cannot) get vitamin D from the sun, we must  get it from supplements or from fortified foods.

21.	The FDA oversees and regulates food fortification in the USA through Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The FDA mandates that two foods be fortified with vitamin D: fortified nonfat dry milk (21 CFR 131.127) and evaporated milk (21 CFR 131.130).  The FDA allows,  but does not mandate, other foods to be supplemented with vitamin D, such as other  milk products, including whole  milk, certain  grain  products, margarine and fruit drinks (see 21 CFR 137.305; 137.350; 137.260; 139.155; 139.115; 131.110; 131.111; 131.112; 131.115; 131.147; 131.200; 131.203; 131.206; 166.110 and 172.380).

22.	As pointed out by the FDA's own employee, the vast majority of all the vitamin D consumed in fortified foods is consumed in the form of milk products. 23

The only two foods mandated by Title 21 to contain vitamin D are milk products. The FDA also knows that the milk industry chooses  to supplement virtually all fresh milk with vitamin D.  The FDA encourages them  to do so through 21 CFR 131.110 and through 21 CFR 101.72.  In 21 CFR 101.72, the FDA allows  product labeling to “include vitamin D so that, in addition to a claim for calcium  and reduced risk of osteoporosis, a claim can be made  for calcium  and vitamin D and reduced risk of osteoporosis.” 24   In consequence, the FDA singularly incentivizes the milk industry to fortify their products with vitamin D, full-well  knowing that milk is a predominant natural source of high levels of calcium,  unlike other foods.  Therefore, through a combination of mandated and encouraged practices, the FDA depends upon milk to deliver virtually all supplemental dietary vitamin D to Americans.

23.	While the FDA primarily uses milk to deliver vitamin D to Americans, African  Americans drink less milk than  whites. The National Medical  Association (NMA) published an important study on the under-consumption of dairy  products in the African  American community and called on African  Americans to greatly increase their dairy  consumption. 25   The NMA found disparate milk consumption was especially prominent in childhood. The reasons for this under-consumption are complex and have to do with a variety of medical and cultural issues.  It now appears that previous reports of African  Americans being unable to consume milk due to lactose intolerance are incorrect. 26 27 28	However, the fact that African Americans consume less milk than  whites is well–established.  29 30

24.	Concretely, in a study by Dairy Management Inc. in 2010, they found that 38% of lactose tolerant African  Americans and 31% lactose intolerant African American drank milk, compared to 61% and 39%, respectively, for the general market. Nine-percent of Caucasian Americans believed themselves to be **lactose intolerant** , compared to nearly  **30% of African Americans** . 31

25.	The FDA knows of these problems. In 2003, an FDA employee warned that vitamin D fortification of foodstuffs in America is not preventing vitamin D deficiency in African  Americans. 32    The same employee said, “The racial/ethnicity groups at greatest risk of vitamin D insufficiency consume less milk . . . than  do their white  counterparts.” Dr. Calvo went  on to say, “African Americans, with the greatest physiological need  for dietary sources of vitamin D, have the lowest  intake  from food alone and food plus supplements.” 33

26.	African  Americans deserve equal  protection against vitamin D deficiency. Furthermore, the FDA knows African  Americans are more likely to suffer from vitamin D deficiency but chooses  to make no efforts to address these specific African  Americans? needs.

27.	In the past, and under similar  circumstances, the federal government has acted to assure those food fortification policies address known health needs.   For example, in 1943, the government mandated that flour be enriched with niacin to prevent pellagra. More recently, the FDA reluctantly began a policy of enriching cereal grain  products with folic acid to prevent birth defects in infants.   The ill effects of vitamin D deficiency may dwarf these other  two problems. In the words of Professor Robert Heaney, another world class expert  on vitamin D, “the cost of vitamin D deficiency, while yet to be fully reckoned, may well be massive.” 34

28.	Foods other  than  milk, such as fruit juice and  cereal grains, could  be mandated to contain vitamin D.  Experts  have called upon the FDA to mandate enrichment of cereal grain  products with both vitamin D and calcium.   35   Such a mandated enrichment program would safely, and cheaply, provide more vitamin D and calcium  (required for many  of Vitamin D?s functions) to African  Americans. The failure  of the FDA to mandate fortification of foods other  than  milk products with vitamin D and calcium  ensures that most African  Americans ingest  deficient diets.   36 37

29.	The FDA?s policies are even more egregious when  one remembers that African  Americans were forced to live at North American latitudes, against their will, via the slave trade. Now,  they find themselves a class of Americans at risk for a serious medical condition, vitamin D deficiency, which  is a direct  result  of the fact their skin pigmentation is designed for equatorial latitudes, not North American latitudes. The USA gets 20 times less vitamin D producing ultraviolet light every year than  equatorial African  zones.   38

30.	The FDA chooses  to fortify a food with vitamin D that many  African Americans do not consume. Caucasian Americans do consume vitamin D enriched milk but are less likely to need  the vitamin D in the first place -- due  to their light skin sufficiently making vitamin D from sunlight. The FDA?s policies and practices actually assure that African  Americans, who get very little vitamin D from the sun, will get little in their diet.  That is, the FDA?s policies help the class of people who need  the least help and hurt  the class of people who need  the most help.

31.	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, to which  the United States is a signatory, provides:

32.	Article 3.  Everyone has the right  to life, liberty,  and security of person.

33.	Article 7.  All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal  protection of the law.  All are entitled to equal  protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

34.	In addition, the right to due process embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States has been interpreted (Bolling v. Sharpe,  347 U.S. 497 (1954) to prohibit the Federal  government from denying its citizens  the equal protection of the laws.

35.	In the words of Justice Louis Brandeis:  "Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.  In a government of laws, existence  of the government will be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our government is the potent, omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches  the whole  people by its example.” <span>[United States v. Olmstead, 277 U.S. 438 (1928)]</span>.

36.	African  Americans have the right  to expect that the FDA?s food fortification policies treat  African  Americans fairly and equitably under the law. Currently, the FDA?s policy fails to treat African  Americans fairly and equitably because the FDA mandates fortification of a food white  Americans consume but fails to mandate vitamin D fortification of foods that African  Americans consume in similar quantities.

37.	As a result,  the FDA?s actions  create unreasonable classifications based on race and fail to address the health problems of African  Americans on an equal  basis with those of other  citizens.

38.	The FDA„s current policies are therefore in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as cited above.

39.	While the FDA?s policies and procedures, as set forth in Title 21, are matters of record, some may dispute our other  contentions. If there is a question that (1) African  Americans have a higher incidence of vitamin D deficiency, or (2) that the majority of African  Americans drink less milk than  Caucasian Americans, we recommend that the National Academy of Sciences settle the matter. The Complainant asserts  that to its knowledge, all the scientific studies in the medical literature support these two assertions, as do the FDA?s own employee.

40.	However, Professor Heaney?s warning that vitamin D deficiency may be causing “massive” disease is suspected by many  to be true but not yet proved. While we wait the needed decades for science to answer the question, it is only equitable and fair that African  Americans and Caucasian Americans await  that answer with similar vitamin D levels.

41.	The Vitamin D Council  respectfully asks you to investigate this matter. Please contact  any of the vitamin D experts listed below.  They can substantiate, and add  to, the concerns we raise with you today about  vitamin D.  Once you assure yourself of the facts in this case, we ask that you ensure the FDA begins  treating African  Americans equally under the law by taking  the following steps:

* A. 	The FDA should immediately consult with experts in the African  American medical and  scientific community, such as the National Medical  Association, to compile a list of foods frequently consumed by African  Americans and make recommendations on more equitable food fortification.

* B.	After appropriate consultation, the FDA should revise its food fortification policies to assure that African  Americans are receiving adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium  in fortified foods.  Their future food fortification policies should make a good  faith effort to correct the disparate and inequitable rate of vitamin D deficiency in the African  American community.

* C. 	The FDA should take steps to see that those subgroups of African  Americans with the highest rate of vitamin D deficiency, such as pregnant African Americans, African  American infants,  and African  American women of childbearing age are further supplemented with vitamin D.

* D. 	The FDA should also revise its recommendations concerning vitamin D supplementation during lactation to assure that African  American breast  milk becomes  an adequate source  of vitamin D.

* E.	 **Although it may not be required under the law, the FDA should consider undertaking further food fortification policy revisions in an attempt to assure that no American, of any color, suffers  from vitamin D deficiency.** 

* F.	The FDA should undertake a public  education effort to warn all Americans about  vitamin D deficiency and take extra steps to target  African  Americans with that message.
