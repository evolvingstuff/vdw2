Background. Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is considered an independent risk factor for death due to cardiovascular events including ischemic stroke (IS). We assessed the hypothesis that decreased levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) are associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with IS. 

Methods. Serum 25-OH-D, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) levels were assessed in serum of 240 consecutive patients admitted  **within the 24 hours after the onset of IS** . Mortality data was obtained from the local registry office. 

Results. 

* Only three subjects (1.3%) had an optimal 25-OH-D level (30-80 ng/mL), 

* 25 (10.4%) had a mildly reduced (insufficient) level, 

* 61 (25.4%) had moderate deficiency, and 

* 151 (62.9%) had a severe VD deficiency. 

20% subjects had secondary hyperparathyroidism. The serum 25-OH-D level was significantly lower than that in 480 matched subjects ( vs.  ng/mL). 

Of all the patients, 79 (32.9%) died during follow-up observation (44.9 months). 

The mortality rates (per year) were  **4.81 and 1.89**  in a group with and without severe VD deficiency, respectively (incidence rate ratio:  **2.52** ; 95% CI: 1.44–4.68). There was no effect of secondary hyperparathyroidism and iFGF23 levels on mortality rates. Age,  ng/mL, and functional status (modified Rankin scale) were significant factors increasing the risk of death in multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression test. 

Conclusions. Severe VD deficiency is an emerging, strong negative predictor for survival after IS, independent of age and functional status. VD supplementation in IS survivals may be considered due to high prevalence of its deficiency. However, it is uncertain whether it will improve their survival.
