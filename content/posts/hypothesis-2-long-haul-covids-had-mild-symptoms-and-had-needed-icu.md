#### Two Long Covid Groups - April 24, 2022

 **In [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/COVID-19-PATHOGENESIS/update/6258cf7c98661c036e0a3bbd)** 

I (Patrick W Chambers) decided to expand my [Long Covid, Short Magnesium - Chambers April 2022](/posts/long-covid-short-magnesium-chambers) (preprint article) to include the below.

Discussion has been limited to Long Covid in the non-hospitalized.  But there appear to be two kinds of Long Covid, both vitamin D/magnesium deficient - white middle aged women who contracted Covid-19 but were never hospitalized and those with comorbidities who were.

Those that developed Long Covid more than 12 weeks after discharge from the ICU (severe not mild Covid-19) appear to be a different group. In addition to low IFN gamma, TGF beta (transforming growth factor) is elevated<sup>[1]</sup>.  TGF beta inhibits IFN gamma<sup>[2]</sup> and is elevated in diabetics, especially those with nephropathy<sup>[3]</sup> and in hypertensives<sup>[4]</sup>.

TGF beta is also elevated in POTS, which shares some dysautonomic features with Long Covid<sup>[5]</sup> and is treated with Losartan<sup>[6]</sup>.  Vitamin D deficiency has also been implicated in autonomic dysfunction<sup>[7]</sup>.  Elevated TGF beta also connects CFS/ME with Long Covid<sup>[8,9]</sup>.  High levels of TGFB1 are associated with hard to treat asthma attacks, fibrosis in organs such as the liver/kidney/lungs<sup>[10]</sup> and autoimmunity.

The elevated TGF beta in CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), which overlaps with Long Covid, can be lowered with losartan<sup>[11]</sup>. 

Ang II induces TGF-ß expression via AT1Rs<sup>[12]</sup> and is treatable by angiotensin receptor blockers<sup>[13,14]</sup> (in addition to vitamin D and magnesium).  Chronic vitamin D deficiency induces lung fibrosis through activation of the RAS<sup>[15]</sup>.
