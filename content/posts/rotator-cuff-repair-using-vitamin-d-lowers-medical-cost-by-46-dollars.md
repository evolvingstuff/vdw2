#### Preoperative Vitamin D Supplementation is a Cost-Effective Intervention in Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair

J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2023 Jun 10 [doi: 10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007) &nbsp; $28 PDF

Background: This study investigates the potential role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective strategy to decrease revision rotator cuff repair (RCR) rates and lower the total healthcare burden from patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR. Previous literature has emphasized the importance of vitamin D on bone health maintenance, soft tissue healing, and outcomes in RCR. Inadequate preoperative vitamin D levels may increase revision RCR rates following primary arthroscopic RCR. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is common in RCR patients, serum screening is not routinely performed.

Methods: A cost-estimation model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of both preoperative selective and nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation in RCR patients in order to reduce revision RCR rates. Prevalence and surgical cost data was obtained from published literature through systematic reviews. Cost of serum 25(OH)D assay and supplementation were obtained from public-use data. Mean, lower and upper bounds of  **one year cost-savings**  were calculated for both the selective and nonselective supplementation scenarios.

Results: Preoperative 25(OH)D screening and subsequent selective 25(OH)D supplementation was calculated to result in a  **mean cost-savings of $6,099,341** (range: $-2,993,000 - $15,191,683)  **per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases.** 

 <span style="color:orange;"> **$24 per procedure (just those who were deficient)** </span>

 

 **Nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation**  of all arthroscopic RCR patients was calculated to result in a mean cost-savings of $11,584,742 (range: $2,492,401 - $20,677,085) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Univariate adjustment projects that selective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical contexts where the cost of revision RCR exceeds $14,824.69 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency exceeds 6.67%. Additionally, nonselective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical scenarios where revision RCR cost ≥ $4,216.06 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency ≥ 1.93%.

 <span style="color:orange;"> **$46 per procedure (Vitamin D given to everyone, no testing)** </span>

Conclusions: This cost-predictive model promotes the role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective mechanism to reduce revision RCR rates and lower the overall healthcare burden from arthroscopic RCR. Nonselective supplementation appears to be more cost-effective than selective supplementation, likely due to the lower cost of 25(OH)D supplementation compared to serum assays.

!!!!Preoperative Vitamin D Supplementation is a Cost-Effective Intervention in Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair
J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2023 Jun 10 doi: 10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007 ~hs~ $28 PDF
Dhiraj Patel 1, Gregory Roy 2, Nathan Endres 2, Chason Ziino 2

Background: This study investigates the potential role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective strategy to decrease revision rotator cuff repair (RCR) rates and lower the total healthcare burden from patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR. Previous literature has emphasized the importance of vitamin D on bone health maintenance, soft tissue healing, and outcomes in RCR. Inadequate preoperative vitamin D levels may increase revision RCR rates following primary arthroscopic RCR. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is common in RCR patients, serum screening is not routinely performed.

Methods: A cost-estimation model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of both preoperative selective and nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation in RCR patients in order to reduce revision RCR rates. Prevalence and surgical cost data was obtained from published literature through systematic reviews. Cost of serum 25(OH)D assay and supplementation were obtained from public-use data. Mean, lower and upper bounds of __one year cost-savings__ were calculated for both the selective and nonselective supplementation scenarios.

Results: Preoperative 25(OH)D screening and subsequent selective 25(OH)D supplementation was calculated to result in a __mean cost-savings of $6,099,341 __(range: $-2,993,000 - $15,191,683) __per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases.__

~~#00F:&#39;&#39;__$24 per procedure (just those who were deficient)__&#39;&#39;~~
 
__Nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation__ of all arthroscopic RCR patients was calculated to result in a mean cost-savings of $11,584,742 (range: $2,492,401 - $20,677,085) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Univariate adjustment projects that selective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical contexts where the cost of revision RCR exceeds $14,824.69 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency exceeds 6.67%. Additionally, nonselective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical scenarios where revision RCR cost ≥ $4,216.06 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency ≥ 1.93%.

~~#00F:&#39;&#39;__$46 per procedure (Vitamin D given to everyone, no testing)__&#39;&#39;~~

Conclusions: This cost-predictive model promotes the role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective mechanism to reduce revision RCR rates and lower the overall healthcare burden from arthroscopic RCR. Nonselective supplementation appears to be more cost-effective than selective supplementation, likely due to the lower cost of 25(OH)D supplementation compared to serum assays.

A friend was going to have rotator cuff surgery in 2013
I suggested that he get a Vitamin D loading dose before his surgery - which he did
His doctor reported that the subsequent surgery had __the fastest recovery he had ever seen.__
