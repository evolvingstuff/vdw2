#### Vitamin D Deficiency in Pediatrics and Its Adult Consequences: An Original Research

DOI : 10.18683/jccp.2024.1091

Background: This study investigates the prevalence and long-term health consequences of Vitamin D deficiency in pediatric populations, focusing on its impact on bone health, immune function, and susceptibility to chronic diseases in adulthood.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 300 pediatric participants aged 5-15 years. Vitamin D levels were measured via serum tests, while Bone Mineral Density (BMD), immune markers (CRP, WBC), and early chronic disease indicators (BMI, blood glucose) were assessed. Statistical analyses included t-tests and Pearson correlations to examine relationships between Vitamin D levels and health markers.

Results: Vitamin D-deficient children exhibited significantly lower BMD, elevated immune markers, and higher BMI, suggesting early health risks. Longitudinal analysis showed that adults deficient in Vitamin D during childhood had a

* compared to <span style="color:#00F;">30%</span> and  **18%** , respectively, among those with sufficient levels.

Conclusion: Pediatric Vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse health outcomes in adulthood, emphasizing the importance of early intervention. Strategies to improve Vitamin D levels in children may reduce the risk of bone disorders, immune dysfunction, and chronic diseases later in life.

 **Conclusion from PDF** 

This study underscores the critical role of maintaining adequate Vitamin D levels in childhood to support long-term health. Pediatric Vitamin D deficiency is associated with lower bone mineral density, increased inflammation, and a heightened risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension in adulthood. These findings highlight the importance of early interventions, including Vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle modifications, to prevent the adverse health impacts linked to deficiency. Addressing Vitamin D insufficiency in children can contribute to improved bone health, immune function, and a reduced risk of chronic conditions, emphasizing the need for proactive public health strategies.
