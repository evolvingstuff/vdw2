#### Birthweight is associated with clinical characteristics in people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes

Diabetologia. 2023 Jun 12. [doi: 10.1007/s00125-023-05936-1](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-023-05936-1)

Aims/hypothesis: Low birthweight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes but it is unknown whether low birthweight is associated with distinct clinical characteristics at disease onset. We examined whether a lower or higher birthweight in type 2 diabetes is associated with clinically relevant characteristics at disease onset.

Methods: Midwife records were traced for 6866 individuals with type 2 diabetes in the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) cohort. Using a cross-sectional design, we assessed age at diagnosis, anthropomorphic measures, comorbidities, medications, metabolic variables and family history of type 2 diabetes in individuals with the lowest 25% of birthweight (<3000 g) and highest 25% of birthweight (>3700 g), compared with a birthweight of 3000-3700 g as reference, using log-binomial and Poisson regression. Continuous relationships across the entire birthweight spectrum were assessed with linear and restricted cubic spline regression. Weighted polygenic scores (PS) for type 2 diabetes and birthweight were calculated to assess the impact of genetic predispositions.

Results:  **Each 1000 g decrease in birthweight was associated with a 3.3 year (95% CI 2.9, 3.8) younger age of diabetes onset** , 1.5 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.2, 1.7) lower BMI and 3.9 cm (95% CI 3.3, 4.5) smaller waist circumference. Compared with the reference birthweight, a birthweight of <3000 g was associated with more overall comorbidity (prevalence ratio <span>[PR]</span> for Charlson Comorbidity Index Score ≥3 was 1.36 <span>[95% CI 1.07, 1.73]</span>), having a systolic BP ≥155 mmHg (PR 1.26 <span>[95% CI 0.99, 1.59]</span>), lower prevalence of diabetes-associated neurological disease, less likelihood of family history of type 2 diabetes, use of three or more glucose-lowering drugs (PR 1.33 <span>[95% CI 1.06, 1.65]</span>) and use of three or more antihypertensive drugs (PR 1.09 <span>[95% CI 0.99, 1.20]</span>). Clinically defined low birthweight (<2500 g) yielded stronger associations. Most associations between birthweight and clinical characteristics appeared linear, and a higher birthweight was associated with characteristics mirroring lower birthweight in opposite directions. Results were robust to adjustments for PS representing weighted genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes and birthweight.

Conclusion/interpretation: Despite younger age at diagnosis, and fewer individuals with obesity and family history of type 2 diabetes, a birthweight <3000 g was associated with more comorbidities, including a higher systolic BP, as well as with greater use of glucose-lowering and antihypertensive medications, in individuals with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

#### Vitamin D given to any child also decreases risk of diabetes

 **Only need 9 months of Vitamin D while pregnant, but child may need D for many decades**
