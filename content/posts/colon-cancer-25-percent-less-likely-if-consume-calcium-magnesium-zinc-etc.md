#### Combined Mineral Intakes and Risk of Colorectal Cancer in Postmenopausal Women.

BACKGROUND: Despite considerable biological plausibility, other than for calcium, there are few reported epidemiologic studies on mineral intake-colorectal cancer (CRC) associations, none of which investigated multiple minerals in aggregate.

METHODS:

Accordingly, we incorporated 11 minerals into a mineral score and investigated its association with incident CRC in the Iowa Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 55 - 69-year-old women who completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1986. In the analytic cohort (n = 35, 221), 1,731 incident CRC cases were identified via the State Health Registry of Iowa. Participants' 

* calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, selenium, potassium, and iodine 

intakes were ranked 1 - 5, with higher ranks indicating higher, potentially anti-carcinogenic, intakes, whereas for iron, copper, phosphorus, and sodium intakes, the rankings were reversed to account for their possible pro-carcinogenic properties. The rankings were summed to create each woman's mineral score. The mineral score-incident CRC association was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

RESULTS: There was decreasing risk with an increasing score (P-trend = 0.001). The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for those in mineral score quintiles 2 - 5 relative to those in the lowest were 0.91 (CI, 0.88-1.08), 0.85 (CI, 0.75-0.95), 0.86 (CI, 0.75-0.97), and  **0.75**  (CI, 0.71-0.95), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a predominance of putative anti- relative to pro-colorectal carcinogenic mineral intakes may be inversely associated with CRC risk.

IMPACT: These results support further investigation of CRC etiology using composite mineral intake scores.
