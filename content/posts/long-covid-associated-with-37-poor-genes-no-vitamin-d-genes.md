Host genetic polymorphisms are recognized as a critical determinant of diversity in clinical symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Accordingly, this study aimed to determine possible associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 37 candidate genetic variants and clinical consequences of COVID-19 – especially long-term symptoms, Long COVID. A total of 260 COVID-19 patients, divided into mild (n = 239) and severe (n = 21) and further categorized based on the presence of Long COVID (no, n = 211; yes, n = 49), were recruited. Genotyping of selected polymorphisms responsible for viral entry, immune response, and inflammation was performed using MassARRAY system.

Out of 37 SNPs, 9 including leucine zipper transcription factor like-1 (LZTFL1) rs10490770 C allele, LZTFL1 rs11385942 dupA allele, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase-1 (NADSYN1) rs12785878 TT genotype, plexin A-4 (PLXNA4) rs1424597 AA genotype, LZTFL1 rs17713054 A allele, interleukin-10 (IL10) rs1800896 TC genotype and C allele, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) rs2285666 T allele, and plasmanylethanolamine desaturase-1 (PEDS1) rs6020298 GG genotype and G allele were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing Long COVID, whereas interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL10RB) rs8178562 GG genotype was significantly associated with a reduced risk of Long COVID. Kaplan-Meier curve displayed that the above gene polymorphisms were significantly associated with cumulative rate of Long COVID occurrence. Polymorphisms in LZTFL1 rs10490770, LZTFL1 rs11385942, LZTFL1 rs17713054, NADSYN1 rs12785878, PLXNA4 rs1424597, IL10 rs1800896, ACE2 rs2285666, PEDS1 rs6020298, and IL10RB rs8178562 appear to be genetic factors involved in development of Long COVID.
