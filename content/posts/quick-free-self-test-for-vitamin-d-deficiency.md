**You basically want to see if 2 of 3 of your bones are tender when pressed**

1. With your thumb, press on your bottom of your sternum (breastbone) = Xiphoid process. - was it tender?

1. Press on the tibia (shin bone) of one leg. -was it tender?

1. Press on the tibia (shin bone) of your  other leg. - was it tender ?

 **If your answer is "yes" to 2 of the 3 tests,   
then you have a <span style="color:#00F;">93% chance of being Vitamin D deficient.</span> (<20 ng)** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If no tenderness, or tenderness in only one location, nothing can be said about your vitamin D level

#### 20X more likely to have sore tibia for >6 months if low vitamin D - Jan 2018

 **Vitamin D deficiency is associated with tibial bone pain and tenderness. A possible contributive role** 

International Journal of Rheumatic Disease https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185X.13253

Mansour Babaei Mehdi Esmaeili Jadidi Behzad Heidari Hemmat Gholinia

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with osteomalacia and a variety of musculoskeletal pain. This study aimed to determine the association of vitamin D deficiency with tibial bone pain and tenderness.

Methods: Patients with leg pain, defined as local pain and tenderness over tibial bones for ≥ 6 weeks, were consecutively selected. Secondary causes of pain were excluded by appropriate clinical, radiological, and laboratory examinations. Serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D (25‐OHD) was assessed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay method, and levels < 20 ng/mL were considered as deficiency. Age‐ and sex‐matched subjects without leg pain served as controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations.

Results

One hundred and eighteen patients and 114 controls aged 46.8 ± 14.8 and 44.6 ± 14.1 years, respectively (P = 0.93), were analyzed. The mean 25‐OHD level was significantly lower (P = 0.001), and the prevalence of 25‐OHD deficiency was significantly higher in the patients as compared with the controls (75.4% vs. 23.6%), odds ratio (OR) = 9.54 (95% CI, 5.22–17.45, P = 0.001). There was a negative dose‐response relationship between serum 25‐OHD and tibial bone pain by

* OR = 17.33 (95% CI, 6.48–46.3) in subjects with 25‐OHD < 10 ng/mL

* OR = 14.7 (95% CI, 6.35–34.6) in serum 25‐OHD levels at 10–19.9 ng/mL

* OR = 2.58 (95% CI, 1.08–6.1) in those with 25‐OHD at 20–29.9 ng/mL

as compared with 25‐OHD ≥ 30 ng/mL.

After controlling for demographic and biochemical factors, the association reached a stronger level of  **19.8**  (6.9–56.3) in subjects with serum 25‐OHD < 10 ng/mL and 14.4 (5.8–34.6) in those with serum 25‐OHD at levels of 10–19.9 ng/mL and 1.85 (0.73–4.6) in 20–29 ng/mL.

Conclusion: These findings indicate a possible contributive role for serum 25‐OHD deficiency in the development of pain and tenderness over the tibial bone.

#### Vitamin D (total of 1,800,000 IU) reduced shinbone tenderness, Feb 2013

 **Tibial Tenderness Identifies Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Responding to High Dose Vitamin D in Pakistani Women.** 

Endocr Pract. 2013 Feb 20:1-20

Ali B, Butt A, Fatima A, McDonnell ME, Masud F.; Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

Objectives: To assess the utility of  **anterior tibial tenderness**  (ATT) measured by visual analog score (VAS) as a clinical diagnostic tool for vitamin D deficiency in a high-risk population of Pakistani women

Methods: ATT using a VAS was assessed in 75 premenopausal women, ages 17-56 (mean 41.3), with generalized aches and pains and calcium of less than 11.0mg/dl (normal: 8-11) at a tertiary care center in Lahore, Pakistan. This was followed by administration of  **1.8 million units of vitamin D3**  in divided doses. ATT, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were checked before and after the injections. Correlation between ATT, vitamin D, and PTH as well as change in ATT, vitamin D, and (PTH) following supplementation, was determined.

Results: Pre-intervention average calcium and vitamin D were 9.3mg/dl (8-10.3) and 12.1 ng/ml (1.5-32.6) respectively. 74% (53/75) of the participants had vitamin D deficiency and elevated PTH (>60).

The mean PTH was 81.6pg/ml (29.1-370).

Change in ATT correlated strongly (r=0.422, p=0.013) with change in PTH.

Following supplementation, there was a significant improvement in ATT (p<0.01) and vitamin D levels (p<0.01), with a decrease in PTH levels (p<0.01).

Conclusions: Anterior tibial tenderness is a valid clinical diagnostic tool for vitamin D deficiency in South Asian women.
