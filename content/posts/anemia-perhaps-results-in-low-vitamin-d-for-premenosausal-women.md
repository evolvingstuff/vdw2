### Low vitamin D levels increase anemia risk in Korean women.

Clin Chim Acta. 2013 Mar 2. pii: S0009-8981(13)00080-6. [doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2013.02.025.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2013.02.025.)

BACKGROUND: We assessed the impact of vitamin D on hemoglobin levels in Korean adults, considering gender and menopause status.

METHODS: We analyzed 2,528 men and 3,258 women divided into quartiles of vitamin D from the Fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of <13g/dl in men and <12g/dl in women.

RESULTS: Pre- and post-menopausal women in the lowest 25-hydroxyvitamin D group were at an increased risk of anemia, after adjusting for confounding factors (OR (95% CI); Premenopausal: Q1 (≥18.45ng/ml), 1; Q2 (14.69-18.44ng/ml), 1.120 (0.745, 1.683); Q3 (11.93-14.68ng/ml), 1.427 (0.963, 2.116); Q4 (≤11.92ng/ml), 1.821 (1.240, 2.673); P=0.009; Post: Q1 (≥22.04ng/ml), 1; Q2 (16.92-22.03ng/ml), 1.106 (0.697, 1.756); Q3 (13.37-16.91ng/ml), 1.167 (0.740, 1.839); Q4 (≤13.36ng/ml), 1.583 (1.026, 2.447); P=0.038). In addition, pre-and post-menopausal women in the lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D group were at a higher risk of Iron deficient anemia and anemia of inflammation. 

 **However, post-menopausal women did not**  show a higher risk of anemia with CKD (p=0.470). Men with the lowest 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels did not show a higher risk of anemia (P=0.528).

CONCLUSIONS: vitamin D-deficient Korean women had a higher risk of anemia.
