#### Interaction and association between multiple vitamins and social adaptability and severity of autism: A large-scale retrospective study from China

Since children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit selective eating behaviors, it is generally believed that they may have abnormal nutrient structure, leading to aberrant concentrations of some serum vitamins. However, previous studies on serum vitamins in individuals with ASD are mixed. Additionally, the interaction and association between multiple serum vitamin and ASD-related symptoms remain unclear. This study utilized a cross-sectional survey with a large sample size (n = 1235) from China to clarify previous mixed findings, and examine the interaction and association between multiple serum vitamins (including 

* folic acid <span>[FA]</span>, 

* vitamin A <span>[VA]</span>, 

* vitamin E <span>[VE]</span>, 

* vitamin B12 <span>[VB12]</span>, and 

* vitamin D <span>[VD]</span>) 

and social adaptability and symptom severity in children with ASD. 

Findings found that  **symptom severity**  was negatively associated with concentrations of serum 

* VA, 

* VE, 

* VB12, and 

* VD; while, 

social adaptability was significantly associated with the natural log-transformed concentrations of FA and VB12. 

Finding also revealed the interaction of VA and VE on the association between both vitamins and severity of ASD symptoms, as well as the interaction of VB12 and FA on the association between both vitamins and social adaptability. In particular, the combination of low concentration of VA and high concentration of VE is associated with the lowest risk of being "severely autistic"; while, the combination of low concentration of FA and high concentration of VB12 is associated with the lowest risk of being "poor social adaptability". This study offers the evidence for the requirement of considering multiple vitamins comprehensively, as well as valuable references for revealing the association between vitamin disparities and food selectivity in children with ASD.

!!!!Interaction and association between multiple vitamins and social adaptability and severity of autism: A large-scale retrospective study from China

Since children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit selective eating behaviors, it is generally believed that they may have abnormal nutrient structure, leading to aberrant concentrations of some serum vitamins. However, previous studies on serum vitamins in individuals with ASD are mixed. Additionally, the interaction and association between multiple serum vitamin and ASD-related symptoms remain unclear. This study utilized a cross-sectional survey with a large sample size (n = 1235) from China to clarify previous mixed findings, and examine the interaction and association between multiple serum vitamins (including 
*folic acid [FA], 
*vitamin A [VA], 
*vitamin E [VE], 
*vitamin B12 [VB12], and 
*vitamin D [VD]) 
and social adaptability and symptom severity in children with ASD. 
Findings found that __symptom severity__ was negatively associated with concentrations of serum 
*VA, 
*VE, 
*VB12, and 
*VD; while, 
social adaptability was significantly associated with the natural log-transformed concentrations of FA and VB12. 
Finding also revealed the interaction of VA and VE on the association between both vitamins and severity of ASD symptoms, as well as the interaction of VB12 and FA on the association between both vitamins and social adaptability. In particular, the combination of low concentration of VA and high concentration of VE is associated with the lowest risk of being &quot;severely autistic&quot;; while, the combination of low concentration of FA and high concentration of VB12 is associated with the lowest risk of being &quot;poor social adaptability&quot;. This study offers the evidence for the requirement of considering multiple vitamins comprehensively, as well as valuable references for revealing the association between vitamin disparities and food selectivity in children with ASD.
