#### Gastic Cancer is 1.5 X more likely if a poor Vitamin D receptor - meta-analysis Aug 2024

 **Common variants of vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and risk of gastric cancer: A meta-analysis** 

Medicine (Baltimore) 2024 Aug 30;103(35):e39527. [doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000039527.](https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000039527.)

*  **Note: VDR-GC studies all appear to assume that VDR ==> GC, but it might actually be the opposite**  

Background: While earlier studies have suggested that variations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene could influence the susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC), the results have shown inconsistency. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the association of 5 common polymorphisms in VDR, including Taq1 rs731236 (T > C), FokI rs2228570 (C > T), Cdx2 rs11568820 (G > A), BsmI rs1544410 (G > A), and ApaI rs7975232 (G > T) with the risk of GC.

Methods: A comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify relevant studies published until January 2024. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to assess the magnitude of associations.

Results: Nine studies, with 2837 participants (1215 GC cases and 1622 healthy controls), were eligible. The FokI rs2228570 polymorphism showed a significant correlation with heightened susceptibility to GC under the recessive model ( **OR = 1.52** ; 95% CI: 1.06-2.19) and homozygote comparison (TT vs CC; OR =  **1.59** ; 95% CI: 1.09-2.31). Taq1 rs731236 was also linked to an elevated risk of GC under the same models (recessive OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.14-2.39; homozygote OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.11-2.54). In the sensitivity analysis, when studies not adhering to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were excluded, the relationship between FokI rs2228570 polymorphism and GC disappeared, while the association for Taq1 rs731236 remained consistent. No significant association was identified for BsmI rs1544410, ApaI rs7975232, and Cdx2 rs11568820.

Conclusion: This study revealed that FokI rs2228570 and Taq1 rs731236 polymorphisms of VDR might be linked to the odds of GC.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/gastric-difference.jpg" alt="image" width="300">

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D<span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and gastric cancer. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, The China Academic Journals full-text database, Wanfang Database of Chinese Academic Journals, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature database were systematically searched. Case-control studies on the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and gastric cancer were retrieved, and the data extracted were analyzed. The results of 9 case-control studies containing 671 patients showed that serum 25(OH)D levels in the gastric cancer group were lower than those in the control group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -8.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): -11.5, -6.32, p &lt; 0.01);

 **the risk of vitamin D deficiency in the gastric cancer group was higher than that in the control group (Odds ratio = 3.09** , 95% CI: 1.96, 4.87, p &lt; 0.01). The serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with well and moderately differentiated gastric cancer were higher than those in patients with poorly differentiated gastric cancer (WMD = -3.58, 95% CI: -6.41, -0.74, p = 0.01). Thus, low levels of vitamin D may increase the risk of gastric cancer. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO CRD42022327942.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate whether vitamin D intake, serum 25(OH) D, and solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation have an effect on the incidence of gastric cancer. Keyword searches of online databases were performed from January 2000 to October 2020. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the relationship of vitamin D intake, serum 25(OH) D level, and UVB radiation with the risk of gastric cancer. 

A total of 11 articles were included and analyzed. When the highest and lowest intake levels of vitamin D were compared, *no significant association was found between vitamin D intake and gastric cancer incidence <span>[effect size (ES): 1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-1.16, P = 0.983]</span>. The ES of serum 25(OH) D level and gastric cancer incidence was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77-1.11, P = 0.4), suggesting no relationship between 25(OH) D level and gastric cancer risk. High UVB radiation was associated with lower gastric cancer incidence ( **ES: 0.86** , 95% CI: 0.84-0.89, P = 0) compared with low UVB radiation. 

Vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH) D level had no relationship with the risk of gastric cancer. 

However, an inverse association was found between solar UVB radiation and gastric cancer incidence.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/gc-meta.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

Object:

To explore the correlation between serum vitamin D level and the occurrence and pathological grade of gastric cancer.

Data sources:

Search the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, Chinese Journal Full-text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Science and Technology Journal Full-text Database, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full-text Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), All articles about the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and gastric cancer published before July 2021.

Results:

10 trials with 1159 cases of gastric cancer patients and 33387 cases of normal control patients were analyzed. The serum vitamin D level of the gastric cancer group(15.56Â±7.46ng/ml) was lower than the control group (17.60Â±1.61 ng/ml), and the difference was statistically significant (MD=-8.28, 95%CI: -14.32~-2.23, P <0.00001). The patients with gastric cancer clinical stage NI/IV(16.19Â±8.04ng/ml) is lower than that of patients with stage I/II (19.61 Â±9.61 ng/ml), and the patients with low differentiation of gastric cancer is (17.5Â± 9.5ng/ml) is lower than that of well or moderately differentiated patients (18.04Â±7.92ng/ml), and the patients with lymph node metastasis (19.41 Â±8.63ng/ml) is lower than that of patients without lymph node metastasis (20.65Â± 7.96ng/ml), the difference is statistically significant;

Conclusions:

Vitamin D levels are negatively correlated with the occurrence of gastric cancer. Vitamin D levels are significantly correlated with different clinical stages, degrees of differentiation and lymph node metastasis, suggesting that low vitamin D levels may be a predictor of poor prognosis in gastric cancer.

Vitamin D has been shown to be beneficial at reducing the risk of cancer; however, studies examining esophageal and gastric cancer have been scarce and findings inconsistent. The UK Biobank cohort was used for this nested caseâ€“control study (N = 3732). Primary, incident esophageal and gastric cancer cases diagnosed after recruitment were identified via linkage to National Cancer Registries. Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring Internet Service database was used to calculate ambient annual UVB dose (D-UVB). Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between annual ambient D-UVB and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer, and odds ratios (ORs) are reported. In total, 373 esophageal and 249 gastric cancer cases and 3110 age- and gender-matched controls were included in the study. We found a strong inverse association between annual ambient D-UVB and odds of developing esophageal or  **gastric cancer** : Compared to the lowest tertile, OR for the highest tertile was  **0.64**  (95%CI:0.51â€“0.79) in adjusted analysis. 

The association was strengthened when restricted to  **esophageal cancer (OR = 0.60** ; 95%CI:0.45â€“0.80) and

 **esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (OR = 0.48** ; 95%CI: 0.34â€“0.68). Similar results were found in unadjusted and stratified analysis. In conclusion, ambient UVB radiation is inversely associated with the development of esophageal and gastric cancer, even in a high-latitude country.

#### Vitamin D not associated with Gastric Cancer - meta-analysis Aug 2015

 **Vitamin D intake, serum Vitamin D levels, and risk of gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis** 

J Res Med Sci. 2015 Aug; 20(8): 790â€“796. [doi: 10.4103/1735-1995.168404](https://doi.org/10.4103/1735-1995.168404)

Saeid Khayatzadeh,1,2 Awat Feizi,3 Parvane Saneei,1,2 and Ahmad Esmaillzadeh1,2

We are aware of no systematic review or meta-analysis of published findings about the association between Vitamin D status and risk of gastric cancer (GC). We systematically reviewed the current evidence on the association between Vitamin D intake as well as serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and risk of GC.

Materials and Methods:

Published evidence in this area was searched to August 2014 through the use of ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Ovid Database, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for relevant articles by cross-referencing. Seven articles had reported odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RR) as their effect size; four papers had reported the ORs between Vitamin D intake and GC; and three papers had reported the association between serum 25(OH)D and risk of GC.

Results:

Pooled effect size for comparison of highest versus lowest intakes of Vitamin D was 1.09 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 0.94, 1.25; P = 0.26) indicating no significant association between Vitamin D intake and risk of GC. We failed to find a significant association between serum Vitamin D levels and risk of GC (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.74-1.14; **P = 0.429** ). Among men, the pooled effect size or highest versus lowest category of serum Vitamin D levels was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.18, P = 0.49). The corresponding figures in women were 1.04 and 95% CI: 0.74-1.47 (P = 0.80).

Conclusion:

We found no evidence for the significant association between Vitamin D status and risk of GC. However, due to limited data in this field, further studies are required to reach a definite conclusion.

#### Genes restrict how much Vitamin D gets to Gastric Cancer - 2021

 **Vitamin D and Gastric Cancer: A Ray of Sunshine?** 

Cureus 13(9): e18275. doi:10.7759/cureus.18275

Suchitra Shah , Zafar Iqbal, Mohammed G. Alharbi , Harjeevan S. Kalra, Megha Suri, Nitin Soni, Nkiruka Okpaleke, Shikha Yadav, Pousette Hamid

Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies, currently ranking third among cancers leading to death worldwide. Despite the recent advancements in GC research, it is most often diagnosed during the terminal stages and with limited treatment modalities contributing to its poor prognosis and a lower survival rate.

Much research has provided conflicting results between a vitamin D deficient status and the development of GC. Vitamin D is a well-known and essential hormone classically known to regulate calcium and phosphate absorption, enabling adequate mineralization of the skeletal system. However, the function of vitamin D is multidimensional. It possesses unique roles, including acting as antioxidants or immunomodulators while crossing the cell membrane, performing several intracellular functions, participating in gene regulation, and controlling the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, including those of GC.

In light of this, it is imperative to analyze the causes of GC, review the factors that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of treatments, and discover the tools to determine prognosis, reduce mortality, and prevent GC development. In this review, we have summarized recent investigations on multiple associations between vitamin D and GC, emphasizing genetic associations, vitamin D receptors, and the prevalence of hormone deficiency in those developing this aggressive malignancy.

##### Conclusions - from pdf (VDR)

Several studies have been conducted to explore the relationship between vitamin D and GC. We observed a variety of correlations between vitamin D and GC. In most studies, GC patients have shown an increased prevalence of VDD, although few studies on VDD prevalence in GC patients are paradoxical. UVB radiation has been shown in most ecological studies to lessen the incidence and mortality of GC. An adequate vitamin D level has been associated with an increase in the survival rate of GC patients, and a low vitamin D level can be considered as a poor prognostic factor in GC.

Furthermore, variations in the VDR gene have been attributed to an increased risk of various malignancies, including GC. Many VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with the risk of GC. However, various research on VDR gene polymorphisms and GC risk have yielded inconsistent results.

Vitamin D exerts an anti-cancer effect by different mechanisms, such as regulating epigenetic pathways, upregulating the expression of miRNAs, boosting the action of cisplatin, stimulating TSGs, and regulating intracellular signal transduction. We also found that serum vitamin D is lower in the HP-positive patients than negative ones, and vitamin D deficient patients fail to eliminate HP. Based on the facts presented above, we may conclude that vitamin D is a protective factor in GC. It can be utilized as a promising technique to treat GC and increase survival rates by correcting the deficiency of vitamin D. However, additional studies are required to fully assess the genetic association of VDR in GC for a more profound knowledge of how to diagnose and treat the aggressive malignancy early and effectively to maximize the survival outcomes.
