Background: Maternal periodontal disease is found in ?40% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. 

Vitamin D deficiency may play a role in periodontal disease and tooth loss, and insufficient vitamin D status is common among pregnant women. 

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and periodontal disease. 

Methods: A case-control study was conducted. Cases were defined as pregnant women with clinical moderate to severe periodontal disease; controls were pregnant women who were periodontally healthy. Maternal data were chart abstracted and serum was collected between 14 and 26 weeks of gestation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels were measured using liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Median serum 25(OH)D levels and prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (defined as <75 nmol/l) were compared between cases and controls. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for moderate to severe periodontal disease among women with vitamin D insufficiency was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for maternal race, season of blood draw, and other potential confounders. 

Results: A total of 117 cases were compared to 118 controls. 

Cases had lower median 25(OH)D levels than controls (59 versus 100 nmol/l; P <0.001) and were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency (65% versus 29%; P <0.001). 

The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for moderate to severe periodontal disease among women with vitamin D insufficiency was  **2.1**  (0.99 to 4.5). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D <75 nmol/l) is associated with maternal periodontal disease during pregnancy. Vitamin D
