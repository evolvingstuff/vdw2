Secondary outcome: categorical overweight or obese (BMI: 85th percentile) for age and gender, at 38 months, 7, 9, 11 and 15 years.</p><p>RESULTS: Of the 10 219 children, 926 (9.06%) were delivered by caesarean section. Those born by caesarean had lower-birth weights than those born vaginally (-46.1 g, 95% confidence interval(CI): 14.6-77.6 g; P=0.004). In mixed multivariable models adjusting for birth weight, gender, parental body mass, family sociodemographics, gestational factors and infant feeding patterns, caesarean delivery was consistently associated with increased adiposity, starting at 6 weeks (+0.11 s.d. units, 95% CI: 0.03-0.18; P=0.005), through age 15 (BMI z-score increment+0.10 s.d. units, 95% CI: 0.001-0.198; P=0.042). By age 11 caesarean-delivered children had 1.83 times the odds of overweight or obesity (95% CI: 1.24-2.70; P=0.002). When the sample was stratified by maternal pre-pregnancy weight, the association among children born of overweight/obese mothers was strong and long-lasting. In contrast, evidence of an association among children born of normal-weight mothers was weak.</p><p>CONCLUSION: Cesarean delivery is associated with increased body mass in childhood and adolescence. Research is needed to further characterize the association in children of normal weight women. Additional work is also needed to understand the mechanism underlying the association, which may involve relatively enduring changes in the intestinal microbiome.</p><p>PMID: 23670220</p><hr><h3 id=probiotics-prebiotics-and-the-host-microbiome-the-science-of-translation>Probiotics, prebiotics, and the host microbiome: the science of translation.</h3><p>Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2013 Dec;1306:1-17. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12303.>doi: 10.1111/nyas.12303.</a> Epub 2013 Nov 22.</p><p>Petschow B1, Doré J, Hibberd P, Dinan T, Reid G, <strong>Blaser M</strong> , Cani PD, Degnan FH, Foster J, Gibson G, Hutton J, Klaenhammer TR, Ley R, Nieuwdorp M, Pot B, Relman D, Serazin A, Sanders ME.</p><p>Recent advances in our understanding of the community structure and function of the human microbiome have implications for the potential role of probiotics and prebiotics in promoting human health.

The goals of the meeting were to share recent advances in research on the microbiota, microbiome, probiotics, and prebiotics, and to discuss these findings in the contexts of regulatory barriers, evolving healthcare environments, and potential effects on a variety of health topics, including the development of obesity and diabetes; the long-term consequences of exposure to antibiotics early in life to the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota; lactose intolerance; and the relationship between the GI microbiota and the central nervous system, with implications for depression, cognition, satiety, and mental health for people living in developed and developing countries.

As part of this revolution, data are increasingly challenging the old dogma that in health, the lung mucosa is sterile. To understand how the lung microbiome may play a role in human health, we identified five major questions for lung microbiome research:</p><ul><li><p>(1) Is the lung sterile?</p></li><li><p>(2) Is there a unique core microbiome in the lung?</p></li><li><p>(3) How dynamic are the microbial populations?</p></li><li><p>(4) How do pulmonary immune responses affect microbiome composition? and</p></li><li><p>(5) Are the lungs influenced by the intestinal immune responses to the gut microbiome?</p></li></ul><p>From birth, we are exposed to continuous microbial challenges that shape our microbiome. In our changing environment, perturbation of the gut microbiome affects both human health and disease. With widespread antibiotic use, the ancient microbes that formerly resided within us are being lost, for example, Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. Animal models show that antibiotic exposure in early life has developmental consequences. Considering the potential effects of this altered microbiome on pulmonary responses will be critical for future investigations.</p><p><strong><a href=http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201306-189MG>Publisher has the PDF behind a $20 paywall</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=antibiotic-exposure-and-the-development-of-coeliac-disease-a-nationwide-case-control-study>Antibiotic exposure and the development of coeliac disease: a nationwide case-control study.</h3><p>BMC Gastroenterol. 2013 Jul 8;13:109. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230X-13-109.>doi: 10.1186/1471-230X-13-109.</a></p><p>Mårild K1, Ye W, Lebwohl B, Green PH, <strong>Blaser</strong> MJ, Card T, Ludvigsson JF.</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>The intestinal microbiota has been proposed to play a pathogenic role in coeliac disease (CD). Although antibiotics are common environmental factors with a profound impact on intestinal microbiota, data on antibiotic use as a risk factor for subsequent CD development are scarce.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>In this population-based case-control study we linked nationwide histopathology data on 2,933 individuals with CD (Marsh stage 3; villous atrophy) to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to examine the association between use of systemic antibiotics and subsequent CD. We also examined the association between antibiotic use in 2,118 individuals with inflammation (Marsh 1-2) and in 620 individuals with normal mucosa (Marsh 0) but positive CD serology. All individuals undergoing biopsy were matched for age and sex with 28,262 controls from the population.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Antibiotic use was associated with</p><ul><li><p>CD (Odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> = 1.40; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 1.27-1.53),</p></li><li><p>inflammation (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.72-2.10) and</p></li><li><p>normal mucosa with positive CD serology (OR = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.30-1.92).</p></li></ul><p>ORs for prior antibiotic use in CD were similar when we excluded antibiotic use in the last year (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.08-1.56) or restricted to individuals without comorbidity (OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.16 - 1.46).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>The positive association between antibiotic use and subsequent CD but also with lesions that may represent early CD suggests that intestinal dysbiosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of CD.

Exposures to non-antibiotic medications were not associated with body mass.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Exposure to antibiotics during the first 6 months of life is associated with consistent increases in body mass from 10 to 38 months. Exposures later in infancy (6-14 months, 15-23 months) are not consistently associated with increased body mass. Although effects of early exposures are modest at the individual level, they could have substantial consequences for population health. Given the prevalence of antibiotic exposures in infants, and in light of the growing concerns about childhood obesity, further studies are needed to isolate effects and define life-course implications for body mass and cardiovascular risks.</p><p>PMID: 22907693</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>PDF (infant) is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p><hr><h3 id=microbionome-and-obesity---june-2013-video---dr-blaser-presenting-a-paper-at-medical-conference>Microbionome and Obesity - June 2013 video - Dr. Blaser presenting a paper at medical conference</h3><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-fHqFhqyk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b-fHqFhqyk</a></p><hr><h3 id=bibliography---blaser----ny-university>Bibliography - Blaser - NY University</h3><p><a href="http://library.med.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/facbibx.pl?AU=blasem01&amp;YR=2000-2015">http://library.med.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/facbibx.pl?AU=blasem01&amp;YR=2000-2015</a></p><hr><h3 id=us-recommendations-on-antibiotics-fails-to-recommend-reduction-of-farm-antibiotics---sept-2014>US Recommendations on antibiotics fails to recommend reduction of farm antibiotics - Sept 2014</h3><p>Their Report told of the problem on antibiotics on the farm, but the recommendations made little mention of it.</p><p>One of the 14 member of the task force was Dennis Treacy, executive <strong>vice president of meat-production</strong> giant Smithfield Foods.</p><p>Perhaps Dennis had something to do with the omission in the recommendations.</p><p>Details at <a href=http://www.wired.com/2014/09/wh-amr-pcast/>White House Actions on Antibiotic Resistance: Big Steps, Plus Disappointments</a> Wired Magazine</p><p>Includes links to both their report and their recommendations.</p><hr><h3 id=who-antibiotics-resistance-2014>WHO Antibiotics Resistance 2014</h3><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/who-antibiotics-slides.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a></strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/who---antibiotics-2014.pdf>Download the slides PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=since-2000-antibiotics-in-chicken-feed-only-increases-growth-by-only--1>Since 2000 Antibiotics in chicken feed only increases growth by only ~ 1%</h3><p><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/03/25/cafos-gut-mental-health.aspx?e_cid=20150325Z1_DNL_NB_art_2&amp;utm_source=dnl&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=art2&amp;utm_campaign=20150325Z1_DNL_NB&amp;et_cid=DM70493&amp;et_rid=889308562">CAFOs, Your Gut, and Mental Health</a> Mercola March 2015</p><p>“The growth response to antibiotics may have decreased over the past 30 years for several possible reasons.</p><ul><li><p>First, the growth response to antibiotics is less important when animal nutrition, hygiene, genetics, and health are optimal.
