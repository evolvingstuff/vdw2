#### A Bad Actor is Pfizer According to NGO

 **[TrialSiteNews](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/a-bad-actor-is-pfizer-according-to-ngo-f5786a44)** 

* A British-founded confederation of 21 independent non-governmental organizations, focusing on the alleviation of global poverty, founded in 1942 and led by OXFAM International (OXFAM), an international NGO,  has issued a scathing report against American multinational pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.

* "With “heavily imbalanced demographics” in the executive suite, the company’s “aggressive lobbying and campaign funding plus the company’s “inequitable business practices” lead to what the NGO positions as an  **extreme example of a bad corporate actor** ."

* "In fact, OXFAM reports that Pfizer’s political expenditures both in terms of overall campaign spending and in outlay on lobbying per revenue dollar  **far surpasses any pharmaceutical peers** , or just about any other entity for that matter."
