 **A few items from the transcript** 

* Grady (where he works) is one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the entire United States

* He works between 80 to 100 hours a week

* 98.8% of our ICU patients were vitamin D deficient

* Interviewer: So vitamin D works sort of across the board in helping you survive whatever it is that is wrong with you

* I've had to go as high as like 70 to 80 on some patients to get the proper response

* UN presentation – They had never heard anything, how vitamin D can affect the whole nation, the country, the world, or the world health organizations. So they had no clue

* US…can probably save over $800 Billion a year if we got everybody's vitamin D level above 40

* Vitamin D is “most common nutritional deficiency in the world”

* Many blacks believe that they get more VItamin D from the sun, rather than 5X less

<span>[music]</span> 00:53 Carol Moulton: Greetings. Greetings. Come on in. I'm pouring the tea. Once again, this is  **Carol Moulton** , your host of TEA Time with Carol, and we are here once again on Saturday, maybe snowing where you are. Hopefully, you're in and nice and cozy, and comfortable. But in any event, I'm pouring the tea today and fluffing the pillows and want you to come in and really put your listening ears on because we've got a special, special guest today. We've got Dr. L. Ray Matthews and this one is gonna be really good. This one's gonna be really, really good. If you've been with me for a while, you know that we've spent a lot of time talking about fear and all the different ways that that can come up in your life. And we're gonna maybe touch on that a little bit as we talk to Dr. Matthews. Growing up in Mississippi is probably not the easiest place in which to grow up and decide you wanna become a doctor, but we're gonna get to all of that.

02:04 CM: But I just want to ask you, first of all, last week we were talking about the two things that you need in order to keep your New Year's resolutions and I really wanna know how you're doing with those. So, if you'd be so kind to give me a hit on Facebook, on TEA Time, or on the Empowerment Radio station on site and just let me know if you've fallen off the wagon, or if you're still on the wagon, or just where you are in keeping those resolutions. But I don't wanna belabor it. I wanna bring our guest in because this is gonna be a really, really, really fast, fast, fast hour.

02:51 CM:  **Dr. Leslie Ray Matthews** , and I'm only gonna say that first name once 'cause I know he doesn't like it. But Dr. L. Ray Matthews is a native of Indianola, Mississippi. And just now, we were trying to figure out how long we've known each other, and we figure it's somewhere between 13, 15, 16 years. And since the day I met him, he has been talking about vitamin D and its benefits. And the interesting thing is that when I first met him, nobody was really talking about vitamin D. That was something that was kinda unheard of. If you went to your doctor to get a physical, they really weren't testing for vitamin D. Now everybody's testing, everybody's looking at vitamin D levels and that has to do in no small way to the efforts and the work of Dr. Matthews.

03:48 CM: Dr. Matthews is, I know he won't do it, so I'm gonna toot his horn for a minute. He is a scholar and a researcher, and has used his research on his patients in Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia where he has saved countless lives. People who were clinically dead, people who were in really, really bad accidents, he's been able to have them recover and not only recover, but walk out of the hospital by using vitamin D and the other items that God has given to him that is really a miracle. I mean is really nothing short of that. I've seen a lot of the research and a lot of the documentation concerning the work that he's done, and it's not only in this country but also overseas.

04:43 CM: Dr. Matthews has been inducted into the **Royal Society of Medicine which, top, top, top** , we're talking Louis Pasteur, and Charles Darwin, and scientists of that caliber who were members of that society. He has been inducted into that. He's been invited to speak at the United Nations, he did that I think last year. He's spoken before at the Black Congressional... Black Caucus. He's been invited to speak in overseas, Dubai, and probably just about every country you can think of. But very, very humble brother, very, very humble, but he's got an incredible story. So I'm not gonna belabor it, I just wanted to give you kind of a little bit of the parameters of who we're gonna be talking to today and I just wanna bring him and welcome, welcome Dr. Matthews into TEA Time with Carol.

05:43  **Dr. L. Ray Matthew** s: Hi Carol. Thank you for inviting me.

05:46 CM: Oh sure. Thank you. It's my pleasure. I'd like to start at the beginning and give people a little bit of an idea of who you are and what made you decide to become a medical doctor? Are you the first doctor in your family? And why did you decide you wanted to be a doctor in the first place? 

06:12  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well, medicine and minister seems to run in my family... My father is a, he was a Baptist minister, my uncle was a Baptist minister who went to school with Martin Luther King at Morehouse, my cousin Fred Matthews was a Baptist minister, so from a family of Baptist ministers and my great grandmother and grandmother in Mississippi were both midwives. So I wanted to be a physician since I was 4-years-old, it's all I ever wanted to be. So I knew what I was destined to do from the time I was 4-years-old.

06:43 CM: Wow. Well, I mean, but what made you... I mean midwives I can kinda see, Baptist ministers, um, maybe not so much. But what was it that kind of sparked it for you that said, "Yeah, I wanna do that"? 

07:00  **Dr. Matthews:**  I think it's just God-given. Some people are predestined even before you're born, and you just know from an early age, what you're supposed to do.

07:08 CM: That's interesting, that's really interesting. So I take it you studied, went all through undergrad, where did you go to medical school? 

07:16  **Dr. Matthews:**  I went to medical school at the University of Mississippi in Jackson, Mississippi, which is Ole Miss basically. So I went to undergrad at Ole Miss, graduated with a degree in chemistry and like I said, Medical School at the University of Mississippi in Jackson, Mississippi.

07:33 CM: And I know you've done, kinda work all over, including at the Mayo. You wanna talk a little bit about, about that and how all that came to be too? 

07:43  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, I did my fellowship in surgical critical care at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota and I was on staff for a couple of years as a senior consultant, associate consultant, and then I moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2007.

08:03 CM: Okay, alright so... And so now what do you do? I know that you are at Morehouse School of Medicine and you're also at Grady. Can you talk a little bit about what that looks like for you? What's a typical day? 

08:22  **Dr. Matthews:**  Sure,  **Grady is one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the entire United States** . Last year we admitted over 4500 trauma patients, and about 30% of those trauma patients have penetrating injuries, knife wounds and gunshots. A full professor in the Department of Surgery at Morehouse School of Medicine, and also the Co-interim Director of Surgical Intensive Care Unit, a Senior Clerkship Director for fourth year medical students that take the SICU Rotation, and I teach nursing students, nurse practitioner students, medical students, and we train young doctors to be surgeons.

09:05 CM: That's a lot <span>[chuckle]</span>

09:06  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yeah quite a bit, keeps me busy.  **I work between 80 to 100 hours a week** .

09:11 CM: Oh, <span>[09:13]</span> . That is soul crushing. So I hope you're taking your vitamin D.

09:18  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, every day. That's the first thing I do in the morning.

09:20 CM: Well speaking of that, can you tell us a little bit about how that came to you because you were really the face of vitamin D. So how did that even begin? Where does that come from? 

09:37  **Dr. Matthews:**  Okay. As far back as Medical School, I remember a nutritional lecturer, so the doctors don't get a lot of lectures on nutrition, so one of my professors said that, "All you have to do is eat three meals a day and you'll be healthy."  **And I was like, "Well how you gonna eat three meals a day when healthy meals and be healthy when 90% of vitamin D is produced by the sun striking your skin. You only get 10% of vitamin D from your diet". So I said, "I'm gonna prove that one day." And so, as far back as medical school I've always been interested in vitamin D.**  But you know you have to go through residency and a lot of other things. So I had to kinda put it on the back burner until I got time in the early 2000s to actually start working with vitamin D.

10:20  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well, actually it's not a vitamin it's a true hormone. So that's what makes it different from the other vitamins. And actually it's the most powerful hormone in your body. You have 30,000 genes in the human body and vitamin D controls 3000 out of 30,000 genes. Or 10% of your DNA.  **So anything that controls 10% of your DNA is very powerful.**  So I figure if this stuff controls 10% of your DNA, what can you do if you learn how to really use it or understand the concepts of it? 

10:50 CM: And so you started working... So what did that look like? How did you study it? What form did that take? 

11:00  **Dr. Matthews:**  Okay. First of all, I read about a thousand articles on it, everything I could get my hands on I read about vitamin D. So I knew everything, learned everything about its molecular structure, what it does, the actions that it does, the genes that it works on. And then I just started diagramming, "Okay, if it works on that, it should be able to affect this." For example, one thing that vitamin D does, it increases your immune response system or how well your body responds to infections and cancers, and bacteria and viruses. So as a surgeon, we are worried about wound infections all the time, we're worried about patients getting pneumonia, and so that's one of the things. I say, if it works on that, I can get my patients out of the hospital faster, lower my mortality rate, and there is less suffering among the patients and you can lower hospital cost. And so those are one of the things. Another thing it does, it decreases your inflammatory response. Inflammatory response to things that causes arthritis, to swelling, the phlegm that you get when you get bronchitis and all that. So if you can decrease that, you can help patients to do better. So if you can control those two arms, the immune response and inflammatory response system, you can do a lot of different things with it.

12:14 CM: So how did you begin testing this after you read these thousands of articles and concluded that it affected these two areas? What was the next step for you? 

12:29  **Dr. Matthews:**  Okay. The next step you have to get IRB approval or Internal Board Review, or in any institution you work in, you have to get approval from your medical school and hospital to do research. So that's a long, tedious application <span>[chuckle]</span> that you have to fill out in order to get IRB approval and you have to state specifically what you're going to do, what are your aims, patient population you're wishing to target, what are your primary outcomes, what are your secondary outcomes gonna be? Then this application has to be reviewed by your IRB Board, it's your medical school and it's your hospital. So after you get approval, it's closely monitored. You wanna design research that does not harm patients at all first of all. So I knew what the dosages was and learned everything I possibly could about potential side effects or toxicity of it if that happens and how to treat it. And so that is how I initially got started.

13:27  **Dr. Matthews:**  So first thing we did was tested everybody in our **ICU**  and we found out  **98.8% of our patients were vitamin D deficient.**  That's almost 100% in sunny Atlanta where there's a plenty of sun. However, we live in a technology society, so people do not go outdoors anymore and everybody wears sunscreen. So we've made a deal with the dermatologists, just go outdoors 15 minutes and then put your sunscreen on, because you have to worry about skin cancers or being unexposed too long. And you only get 10% of vitamin D from the diet, so you cannot eat enough food to satisfy how much vitamin D you need on a daily basis.

14:09 CM: And so, what was the next step? You got the approval...

14:13  **Dr. Matthews:**  True.

14:13 CM: And you tested everybody, and I know the rule is first do no harm.

14:18  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes. Correct.

14:19 CM: So how did you start testing it on people, on patients? 

14:24  **Dr. Matthews:**  Alright. So once we knew exactly, we checked the levels on everybody too. So the average levels in our patients, I looked at the different demographics, the lowest vitamin D levels were in

* African-American women, which had a level of about 9.8 nanograms per milliliter. 

> Federal Government states that normal vitamin D level is 30 nanograms per milliliter.

* So the average African-American lady was 9.8, that's nowhere near 30. 

* The next lowest group is African-American males, they're about 12, and then the 

* other two groups were the Caucasian males and females, they're around 18. 

So we know from previous research that once your vitamin D level gets below at 18 nanograms per milliliter, your risk of death goes up 30% from all causes. So if you come in a hospital, you have a stroke or heart attack, you have a traumatic brain injury, you have sepsis, if your vitamin D level is below 18 and stays there, your risk of death goes up 30% just from that alone. So I said, you can basically lower some of those mortality rate 30% just by getting a vitamin D level above normal. And so we also applied a graph to our chart where we looked at the different effects of vitamin D.

15:34  **Dr. Matthews:**  So we know that from our research that when people's vitamin D levels got below 13, between that 18 to 13 range, that mortality rate just went up through the roof regardless of what the cause was. And so after our patients got above 18 and started getting above 30, the mortality rate went down tremendously. And so we knew for a fact that the stuff is associated with increased mortality rate when your vitamin D level is real low and longer hospital stays, longer ICU stays and just a whole bunch of other problems and complications. So we plotted a graph and then we know once your vitamin D level gets above 40, you basically almost have zero mortality. I don't think we've had a single person in our ICU to die with a vitamin D level less than 30 over the like 12 years we've been doing research.

16:28 CM: Wow. That is amazing. So let me see if I understand what you're saying. You're saying when people come in, regardless of the reason or why they're coming to the hospital, or how sick they are, if their vitamin D level is below 13, it...

16:48 CM: Their chances of dying from whatever cause is much higher than if...

16:54  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes. Correct.

16:54 CM: They have a higher vitamin D level when they come in.  **So vitamin D works sort of across the board in helping you survive whatever it is that is wrong with you.** 

17:08  **Dr. Matthews:**  That's totally correct. Yes, when at 13-18 range, it helps you survive whatever disease process that you may have. 'Cause remember it stimulates your immune system, so you need a strong immune system  **so basically it makes your immune system a lot stronger, so your immune system can fight off any type of infection, viruses, bacterial, cancer** or whatever disease that you may have and it decreases the inflammatory response, 'cause everything, all diseases mostly are associated with inflammation. You have acute inflammation and you have chronic inflammation. Acute inflammation is what helps a wound or surgeon wound heal when you operate on a patient. You notice initially the wound is angry red and then over period of time, it gets back to normal looking in about a year. So acute inflammation is good, but chronic inflammation is bad. So, most of diseases that we know of mankind are associated with chronic inflammation.

18:02 CM: Like what diseases are you talking about? 

18:06  **Dr. Matthews:Any diseases, aging, heart attacks, strokes, cancers, arthritis, joint swelling, joint problems, dementia, Alzheimer's, basically, chronic kidney disease, almost any disease that you can think of.** 

18:21 CM: Wow, is the result of inflammation? Wow.

18:24  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, inflammation and free radical formation. Once your body metabolizes food, and just going through the daily processes every day, you produce a lot of free radicals. Free radicals are unpaired electrons on the outer shell of molecules, little, small, at molecular level. So molecules are like human beings, they like to be paired, so when these electrons have unpaired electrons they go out and steal electrons from your DNA and from your mitochondria, which is a powerhouse of the cell. It's sort of like when you bite an apple and you place that apple on a desk, what happens to that apple? You come back several hours later that apple has rusted, that's oxidation. So that's what happens to our body with the free radicals produced in terms of the apple, it turns that apple brown, and whereas with humans, it turns us grey. We start greying as we age 'cause of oxidation basically.

19:19 CM: Hmm, I never knew that.

19:20  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yeah. Chronic inflammation, oxidation, are the two worst culprits in your body. So you wanna keep those under wraps. It's kinda like washing your car. If you put two Ferraris outdoors and just left them there and washed one and waxed it every week, and you did nothing to the other one, just left it to the elements, the snow, the rain, which one of those cars is gonna look better a year later? Even though they're the exact same age, one of them cars is gonna look brand new, the other car is gonna look aged, because you're didn't have any wax on it or you didn't wash it. So basically, wax serves as kinda... That's what vitamins kinda do, kinda serves as a protective coat or layer or keeps things from aging as fast. We're all gonna age but you just don't age as fast. Once you take antioxidants and things that decrease chronic inflammation.

20:04 CM: Well, we certainly wanna slow it down, that's for sure. <span>[chuckle]</span> That's certainly true. So, now you mentioned 13 and 18 as being kind of bad numbers. What's a good number that we should should strive to be at? I mean, I'm not talking about when you're sick but just to maintain being healthy, where should our levels be? 

20:28  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well, it depends, each person is different, number one. And so... I think the problem, or the debate they're having with vitamin D research, most people do not, most physicians don't understand that that level is different for each person, because each person has different height, weight, sizes, and it depends on your metabolism of things and what disease process you have. For example, just to be normal, healthy walking around, you need to have your vitamin D level at least 40 at the minimum. And the federal government level, is at 30 nanograms per milliliter, but at 40 nanograms per milliliter, you get maximum bone density. So that would be important for a patient with what, osteoporosis. So if I have weak bones or frequent fractures, I'd definitely need to keep my level above 40, and you get maximum muscle contraction at 40 nanograms per millimeter also. So if I'm a person that's falling all the time in the nursing homes, I need stronger muscles. I've gotta make my muscles stronger and my bones stronger so I should have less frequent falls.

21:29  **Dr. Matthews:**  Also that's important for athletes also because if I'm an athlete I want maximum muscle contraction which means I should be able to run faster, jump a little higher and sustain prolonged muscle activity over a longer period of time and I should get injured less, and my bones should be stronger and I should have fewer fractures, fewer sprains and all of that. At 50 nanograms per milliliter you get maximal stimulation of your immune system and you decrease your inflammatory response system, so your immune system really doesn't kick in until you get above 50. So if I have a bad infection or something I definitely need my immune, my vitamin D level above 50. And then in some disease processes  **I've had to go as high as like 70 to 80 on some patients to get the proper response** . So you just can't say there's one magical number. But the lowest number I would suggest would be 40 to 50 range.

22:24  **Dr. Matthews:**  And so, all animals in nature, if you look at, everything makes vitamin D should tell you how important it is. All plants make vitamin D, they make D2 and all animals make Vitamin D, we make D3. So all plants and animals, every living thing on this planet needs vitamin D to live or survive. So that should tell you how important it is, or hormone D. And all animals in nature, if you went out on the Serengeti and captured a giraffe or something and check his vitamin D level, they,  **all the animals use around between 50 to 55** . So, I think mother nature is a lot smarter than us. So therefore a healthy individual that's not sick, 50 to 55 is out, but if you're sick or injured or something, sometimes you have to push it a lot higher. So there is no one magical number, you just need to know the ranges, and what you need it for.

23:13  **Dr. Matthews:**  So it does different things at different concentrations. So at above 40, you have maximum bone density but it doesn't affect your immune response system. So if I did research and said "Well vitamin D doesn't work," and all my patients' vitamin D level's at 30, it's not gonna work 'cause it's not at 50, so it's not stimulating the immune response system. I may not have as many fractures but it's not gonna do anything for the immune response system.

23:36 CM: I see. So now, what do you recommend, now you mentioned D2 and you also mentioned D3. So what's the difference, what do I need, and what should I be taking? I don't mean the dosage necessarily but should I be taking D2 or D3 or... You know? 

23:54  **Dr. Matthews:**  Well we're humans, we're animals, so we make the D3 form. Plants make D2. So the D3 is, you absorb that 87% better than you do the D2. Usually the people with low D2 are the people who don't eat any meat products.

24:11 CM: Okay, vegan? 

24:12  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yeah. Mm-hmm. And so I explained to 'em that it's not as, you don't get the same absorption as you would with the D3.

24:19 CM: I see. I see. So is it enough to take supplements from wherever, Walmart or Kmart or whatever? 

24:29  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, that's what I do, I take supplements, first thing what I do when I get up in the morning I take a multivitamin and a vitamin D3 'cause you need it, you need it every day. And it's important, like I say it controls like 10% of your DNA. That's very important. So anything that controls my DNA, if I'm low in it that means my DNA is not functioning proper.

24:52 CM: Wow. That's interesting. Now, I know that you spoke at the United Nations recently, was there an interest in other countries about your research or tell me about that? 

25:09  **Dr. Matthews:**  I think they were mesmerized or shocked, 'cause it's like they had had no idea.  **They had never heard anything, how vitamin D can affect the whole nation, the country, the world, or the world health organizations. So they had no clue**  And so if you're a poor developing country and you have a lot of infectious diseases, just by getting the vitamin D levels up you can cut out a lot of sickness, a lot of illness, 'cause remember I said, once your vitamin D level gets in the 13-18 range, your immune response system doesn't work, your inflammatory response system is out of control, and so you have healthier bones and stronger muscles, so, healthy people costs the government less.

25:49  **Dr. Matthews:**  Unhealthy people cost the government, state city or institution or organization more money. And so there's been research that's shown that people that have low Vitamin D levels are sick and have more days absent from work a year, and so, actually, your insurance is gonna be higher. So basically, I've estimated just by... If we got everybody's vitamin D level to just above 40, we can probably save like a trillion dollars, worldwide every year. And that's a conservative estimation.

26:21  **Dr. Matthews:**  So in the United States alone,  **we can probably save over $800 Billion a year if we got everybody's vitamin D level above 40.**  You will see decreased re-admissions to hospitals, you'd see decrease falls, decreased infections and a lot of things. So we can save a lot of money with that alone. So, you cut healthcare costs then you could use that money build up your industry, hire people to do jobs, build an infrastructure and do a whole host of things. So healthy people pay taxes, they are working, they're not as injured, they're not as sick, you can cut your Medicare or Medicaid bills and you have more people paying into Social Security, so the system will feed itself and it's a relatively cheap or inexpensive way to solve a lot of issues or problems we're facing today.

27:04 CM: Wow. Well, from the time that you started to now, where do you see us, and I mean not just United States, but everybody at in terms of vitamin D? Do you think that there's a lot more interest or are we still lagging behind like, "Oh, we need to do more research." Where do think things are now? 

27:30  **Dr. Matthews:**  I think we're still lagging behind. The World Health Organization just released a report in which they stated that up until 2050, they still expect to see a lot of mineral and vitamin deficiencies because we're lagging behind. Out of all the things that they listed that should be targets, I think there is not a single nation on the planet, that's reaching all of those targets for minerals and vitamins and stuff. So we still have a lot of work to do and a long ways to go, so we need to explain to our elected officials and at every level of state, national, international level that this is a major problem. This is the 800-pound elephant in the living room. You cannot have a healthy society without addressing the most common nutritional deficiency in the world. So by a conservative estimation, over a billion people on the planet are vitamin D deficient, and that's a conservative estimation. We're using 30 nanograms per milliliter, but we know 30 nanograms per milliliter is not where you should be, you should above 40 or 50 ranges just like other animals. **I think mother nature's a lot smarter than human beings and governments.** 

28:36 CM: Right. So we should listen, right? <span>[chuckle]</span>

28:38  **Dr. Matthews:**  Yes, we should. <span>[chuckle]</span>

28:41 CM: <span>[28:41]</span>  **** . Well, believe it or not, we're almost at the halfway mark. So we're going to take a quick pause for station identification, and when we come back, I wanna ask you about your work with athletes and some of the other cases that you've seen at Grady that have received a lot of national and international attention. So we will be back in one minute and a half.

29:11  **Dr. Matthews:**  Okay.

29:11 CM: Alright, thanks.

29:12  **Dr. Matthews:**  Thanks. <span>[music]</span>
