OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this study was to investigate the possible association between maternal/neonatal 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) levels and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

STUDY DESIGN:

One hundred and thirty-two preterm infants < 32 weeks of gestation who were diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled. 25-OHD levels were determined in maternal/neonatal blood samples that were obtained at the time of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.

RESULT:

A total of 100 infants were included and 31 (31%) developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Both maternal and neonatal 25-OHD levels in the BPD group were significantly lower compared with those in the no-BPD group (P=0.0001). A positive correlation was detected between maternal and neonatal 25-OHD levels. All of the infants with BPD had a 25-OHD level <10 ng ml-1, which represented severe deficiency. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels were a significant predictor of BPD (odds ratio (OR): 0.76 and 0.61, respectively, P<0.001).

CONCLUSION:

We demonstrated for the first time that lower maternal and neonatal vitamin 25-OHD levels were associated with BPD development in preterm infants. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to delineate the possible link between vitamin D deficiency and BPD.
