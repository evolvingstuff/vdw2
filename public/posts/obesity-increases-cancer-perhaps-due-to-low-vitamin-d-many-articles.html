Epidemiological evidences associate ovarian cancer with obesity. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer and accounts for a high rate of mortality. The association between ovarian cancer and obesity could be explained by molecular factors secreted by adipose tissue <strong>such as leptin</strong> . In EOC, leptin increases cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Additionally, adipose tissue synthesizes endogenous estrogens, which increase cell proliferation of epithelial ovarian cells. Also, obesity associated hyperinsulinism could increase ovarian estrogen secretion.</p><p><a href=http://revmedchile.org/flips/Revista-Medica-de-Chile-Mayo-2014/#/52/Full%20article%20in%20Spanish%20is%20online>http://revmedchile.org/flips/Revista-Medica-de-Chile-Mayo-2014/#/52/Full article in Spanish is online</a></p><hr><h4 id=obesity-increases-risk-of-cancer---perhaps-vitamin-d---aug-2010>Obesity increases risk of cancer - perhaps vitamin D - Aug 2010</h4><p><strong>Obesity and increased risk of cancer: does decrease of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with increasing body mass index explain some of the association?</strong></p><p>Mol Nutr Food Res. 2010 Aug;54(8):1127-33. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200900512.>doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200900512.</a></p><p>Lagunova Z1, Porojnicu AC, Grant WB, Bruland Ø, Moan JE.</p><p>1Department of Radiation Biology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. <a href=mailto:zoya.lagunova@rr-research.no>zoya.lagunova@rr-research.no</a></p><p>Low levels of vitamin D and excess body weight are both factors associated with increased risk of cancer. The increased risk seems to be proportional to the increase in BMI, and to decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level. Our earlier investigations suggest that serum 25(OH)D levels decrease with increasing BMI. Although the connection between cancer risk, BMI and vitamin D status might be arbitrary, it has not been discussed in the literature so far. In this study, we analyze data published in current meta-analysis, prospective studies, and systematic reviews on cancer-specific risk attributed to high BMI and low vitamin D status. The contribution of low 25(OH)D levels associated with high BMI to increased cancer risk was calculated for 13 vitamin-D-sensitive cancers with a focus on colorectal and breast cancer as the most frequently studied vitamin-D-sensitive cancer types.</p><p><strong>Our study suggests that a low vitamin D status may explain at least 20% of the cancer risk attributable to high BMI.</strong></p><p>The contribution of low 25(OH)D to the increased cancer risk with increasing BMI may be different for different cancer types.</p><p>Thus, we find 40% for breast cancer, and 26% and 75% for colorectal cancer in men and women, respectively.</p><p>PMID: 20512788</p><p><strong><a href=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.200900512/pdf>Publisher charges $6 to rent the PDF</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=bmi-associated-with-36-of-new-cancer---lancet-2014-not-mention-vitamin-d>BMI associated with 3.6% of new Cancer - Lancet 2014 (not mention vitamin D)</h4><p><strong>Global burden of cancer attributable to high body-mass index in 2012: a population-based study</strong></p><p>The Lancet Oncology, Early Online Publication, 26 Nov 2014, doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(14)71123-4</p><p>Dr Melina Arnold PhD a <a href=mailto:arnoldm@fellows.iarc.fr>arnoldm@fellows.iarc.fr</a>, Nirmala Pandeya PhD d †, Graham Byrnes PhD b, Prof Andrew G Renehan PhD e, Gretchen A Stevens DSc f, Prof Majid Ezzati FMedSci g, Jacques Ferlay MSc a, J Jaime Miranda PhD h, Isabelle Romieu PhD c, Rajesh Dikshit PhD i, David Forman PhD a, Isabelle Soerjomataram PhD a</p><p>Background: High body-mass index (BMI; defined as 25 kg/m2 or greater) is associated with increased risk of cancer. To inform public health policy and future research, we estimated the global burden of cancer attributable to high BMI in 2012.</p><p>Methods: In this population-based study, we derived <strong>population attributable fractions (PAFs)</strong> using relative risks and BMI estimates in adults by age, sex, and country. Assuming a 10-year lag-period between high BMI and cancer occurrence, we calculated PAFs using BMI estimates from 2002 and used GLOBOCAN2012 data to estimate numbers of new cancer cases attributable to high BMI. We also calculated the proportion of cancers that were potentially avoidable had populations maintained their mean BMIs recorded in 1982. We did secondary analyses to test the model and to estimate the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use and smoking.</p><p>Findings: Worldwide, we estimate that 481 000 or <strong>3·6% of all new cancer cases</strong> in adults (aged 30 years and older after the 10-year lag period) in 2012 were attributable to high BMI. PAFs were greater in <strong>women than in men (5·4% vs 1·9%)</strong> . The burden of attributable cases was higher in countries with very high and high human development indices (HDIs; PAF 5·3% and 4·8%, respectively) than in those with moderate (1·6%) and low HDIs (1·0%). Corpus uteri, postmenopausal breast, and colon cancers accounted for 63·6% of cancers attributable to high BMI. A quarter (about 118 000) of the cancer cases related to high BMI in 2012 could be attributed to the increase in BMI since 1982.</p><p>Interpretation: These findings emphasise the need for a global effort to abate the increasing numbers of people with high BMI. Assuming that the association between high BMI and cancer is causal, the continuation of current patterns of population weight gain will lead to continuing increases in the future burden of cancer.</p><p>Funding: World Cancer Research Fund International, European Commission (Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship), Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and US National Institutes of Health.</p><p><strong><a href=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(14)71123-4/abstract>Publisher charges $31.50 for the PDF</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141125205710.htm>Study was summarized in Science Daily</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=bmi-and-cancer-aug-2014-lancet-not-mention-low-vitamin-d>BMI and Cancer Aug 2014 Lancet (not mention low vitamin D)</h4><p><strong><a href=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140814000816.htm>Overweight and obesity linked to 10 common cancers, over 12,000 cases every year in UK</a> Science Daily on a different Lancet Study] – Aug 2014</strong></p><p>A higher body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of developing 10 of the most common cancers, the largest study of its kind on BMI and cancer, involving more than 5 million adults in the UK, shows.
