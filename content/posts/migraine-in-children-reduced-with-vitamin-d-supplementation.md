The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementary vitamin D therapy in addition to amitriptyline on the frequency of migraine attacks in pediatric migraine patients. Fifty-three children 8-16 years of age and diagnosed with migraine following the International Headache Society 2005 definition, which includes childhood criteria, were enrolled. Patients were classified into four groups on the basis of their 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels. Group 1 had normal 25(OH)D levels and received amitriptyline therapy alone; group 2 had normal 25(OH)D levels and received vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/day) plus amitriptyline; group 3 had mildly deficient 25(OH)D levels and received amitriptyline plus vitamin D (800 IU/day); and group 4 had severely deficient 25(OH)D levels and was given amitriptyline plus vitamin D (5000 IU/day). All groups were monitored for 6 months, and the number of migraine attacks before and during treatment was determined. Calcium, phosphorus alkaline phosphatase, parathormone, and 25(OH)D levels were also determined before and during treatment. Results were compared between the groups. Data obtained from the groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. The number of pretreatment attacks in groups 1 to 4 was 7±0.12, 6.8±0.2, 7.3±0.4, and 7.2±0.3 for 6 months, respectively (all P>0.05). The number of attacks during treatment was 3±0.25, 1.76±0.37 (P<0.05), 2.14±0.29 (P<0.05), and 1.15±0.15 (P<0.05), respectively. No statistically significant differences in calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, or parathormone levels were observed (P>0.05). Vitamin D given in addition to anti-migraine treatment reduced the number of migraine attacks.

## Summary by VitaminDWiki

#### Amitriptyline was given in addition to vitamin D to all children

#### || Vitamin D status  
BEFORE|Vitamin D Dose| Migrane rate  
 BEFORE|Migrane rate  
 AFTER

Normal|0 IU|7|3

Normal|400 IU|6.8|1.76

Mildly deficient |800 IU|7.3|2.14

Severely deficient |5000 IU|7.2|1.15||

### Note:

1. The most vitamin D deficient children had the largest reduction in migraine attacks

1. Vitamin D reduced migraines in every group.

1. amitriptyline is a depressant - see [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitriptyline)
