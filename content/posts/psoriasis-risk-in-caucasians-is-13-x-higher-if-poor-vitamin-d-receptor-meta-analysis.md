BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is considered a regulator of the immune system, and its polymorphisms have been associated with psoriasis in some but not all reports.

AIM: To explore whether vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to psoriasis.

METHODS: Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the associations between psoriasis and the VDR ApaI, TaqI, BsmI and FokI polymorphisms in all participants, and stratified by ethnic group.

RESULTS:

In total, 16 studies on VDR polymorphisms and psoriasis were included in this meta-analysis, which involved 2086 patients and 2182 controls. The meta-analysis indicated an association between psoriasis and the VDR TaqI TT genotype in Caucasian (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.00-1.66, P < 0.05), but not in Asian (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.89-1.96, P = 0.16) populations. However, no association was found between psoriasis and the VDR TaqI polymorphism using dominant, allele contrast or homozygous contrast models. No association was found between psoriasis and either the VDR ApaI, BsmI or FokI polymorphisms by meta-analyses of the allele contrast, recessive, or dominant models or homozygous contrast models in the overall, Caucasian or Asian populations.

CONCLUSION:

This meta-analysis showed that polymorphisms in VDR ApaI, BsmI and FokI are not associated with psoriasis susceptibility in overall, Caucasian or Asian populations. However, the VDR TaqI polymorphism is associated with psoriasis susceptibility in Caucasian populations.

Background

The study aims at scientifically investigating the genetic effect of four polymorphisms (rs7975232, rs1544410, rs2228570, and rs731236) within the human Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene on the odds of psoriasis through an updated meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched eight databases and screened the studies for pooling. Finally, a total of eighteen eligible case-control studies were included. BH (Benjamini & Hochberg) adjusted P-values of association (Passociation) and odd ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated under the allele, homozygote, heterozygote, dominant, recessive, and carrier models.

Results

Compared with the negative controls, no statistically significant difference in the odds of psoriasis was detected for the cases under any genetic models (BH adjusted Passociation > 0.05). We also performed subgroup meta-analyses by the source of controls, ethnicity, country, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and genotyping method. Similar results were observed in most subgroup meta-analyses (BH adjusted Passociation > 0.05). Besides, data of Begg’s and Egger’s tests excluded the significant publication bias; while the sensitivity analysis data further indicated the statistical reliability of our pooling results.

Conclusion

The currently available data fails to support a robust association between VDR rs7975232, rs1544410, rs2228570 and rs731236 polymorphisms and psoriasis susceptibility, which still required the support of more case-control studies.
