#### Sunlight and Health: Shifting the Focus From Vitamin D3 to Photobiomodulation by Red and Near-Infrared Light

Review Ageing Res Rev. 2020 May 25;101089. [doi: 10.1016/j.arr.2020.101089](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2020.101089)

 **A decade of very positive personal experience with Low Level Laser Therapy** 

The founder of VitaminDWiki designed and bullt an LLLT for his wife's lymphedema which resulted from Breast Cancer treatments.

My LLLT was designed to shine flashing 902 nanometer infrared light as deep as 2 inches into the body,

An LLLT book from Russia indicated that the on/off flashing far more important than just the intensity of light.

My LLLT flashes the light 100,000 times per second

Since 2009 (before starting VitaminDWiki) it worked well for lymphedema as well as many other health problems that are near to the surface of the skin.

 **LLLT treatment has more variables than Vitamin D** 

 **I expect it will take at least another decade for the medical profession to come to use it** 

* Frequency of light

   * Perhaps multiple frequencies could be used concurrently

* Intensity of Light

* Intensity modulation of light while it is on

* Use of pulsed light to get far deeper into the body

* Pulsing of light to improve benefit over that of just intensity 

   * Duty cycle might be important

   * varying the pusle rate might be important - the cells "get used" toa constant rate 

* When the treatment is given (appears that just before bedtime is great)

* How many different sites on the body is treated at a session 

   * It appears that too many sites results in less healing focus by the body

The exact mechanisms for these effects are not well known, though preliminary evidence suggests

possible roles for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and photolabile sources of nitric oxide

(Serrage et al., 2019). The existence of mitochondria-related mechanism is supported by studies

reporting photobiomodulation-induced changes in ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential

(ΔΨm), cytochrome c oxidase activity, oxygen consumption and activity of SIRT1/PGC1α pathway,

as well as protection of mitochondria against toxins such as potassium cyanide and tetrodotoxin

(Hamblin, 2018; Wong-Riley et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2020).

Currently, the scientific literature concerning PBM encompasses more than 4,500 scientific articles,

including more than 1500 animal trials and 700 randomized clinical trials. The publication rate of PBM

research has increased rapidly during the 21st century, and the current publication rate is

approximately 500 new articles annually (Figure 1)

The overview is based on a personal database of approximately  **4700 scientific articles**  related to PBM,

compiled by manual literature search ([http://www.bitly.com/PBM-database](http://www.bitly.com/PBM-database); Accessed on 3 March 2020
