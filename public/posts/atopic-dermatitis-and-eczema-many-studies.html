Despite ongoing research, its exact cause remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the factors that influence the severity of AD in children and assess the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the disease&rsquo;s severity. We enrolled 96 AD patients in our investigation, evaluated their clinical condition using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and compared them to a group of 90 healthy controls. Our analysis revealed that serum vitamin D levels and eosinophil counts significantly impacted the SCORAD index (p &lt; 0.001). According to standardized regression coefficients, for each incremental unit in serum vitamin D levels, the SCORAD index exhibited a decrease of 0.449 units. Similarly, a one-unit increase in eosinophil count resulted in a 0.009 unit increase in the SCORAD index. It is worth noting that the influence of serum vitamin D levels on disease severity surpasses that of eosinophil counts and atopic conditions. In our patient cohort, we uncovered a negative correlation (r = -0.419, p &lt; 0.001) between serum vitamin D levels and the SCORAD index. Our findings suggest that low serum vitamin D levels may have a more substantial impact on AD severity than atopic conditions and eosinophilia. Furthermore, we observed a negative association between the severity of AD and serum 25(OH)D3 levels.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/d-and-atopic-dermatitis.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p>&ndash;</p><h4 id=atopic-dermatitis-8-ng-lower-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-aug-2022>Atopic Dermatitis: 8 ng lower vitamin D - meta-analysis Aug 2022</h4><p><strong>Serum Vitamin D Level and Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Children with Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Comput Math Methods Med . 2022 Jul 20;2022:9407888. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9407888.>doi: 10.1155/2022/9407888.</a> eCollection 2022.</p><p>Hongbo Fu 1, Yanting Li 2, Huimin Huang 3, Dan Wang 3</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/atopic--8-ng.jpg alt=image width=600><p>Background: The relationship between vitamin D and atopic dermatitis (AD) is controversial. This meta-analysis is aimed at exploring vitamin D level and its deficiency in pediatric AD and at evaluating the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials were searched. Binary variables and continuous variables were measured by odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The modified Jadad scale, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and Cochrane&rsquo;s bias risk tools were used to evaluate study quality and the risk of bias of eligible studies, respectively.</p><p>Results: A total of 22 literature were included in the analysis. Serum 25 (OH) D level in pediatric AD patients was significantly lower than that of the control group with a combined MD value of -8.18 (95% CI: -13.15, -3.22). Patients with AD were more prone to develop vitamin D deficiency with a combined OR value of 2.17 (95% CI: 1.15, 4.11). According to the score of SCORAD, the level of serum 25 (OH) D level in patients with severe AD was significantly lower than that in patients with mild AD (combined MD = 9.23, 95% CI: 6.92, 11.55). Both self-control studies and randomized controlled trials showed improved SCORAD score and EASI score after vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed lower serum 25 (OH) D level and increased risk of vitamin D deficiency in pediatric AD patients as compared with healthy controls. The serum 25 (OH) D level in severe AD patients was significantly lower than that in the mild AD patients. The SCORAD and EASI score improved after vitamin D supplementation, suggesting its beneficial effect to AD patients. At the same time, more homogeneous studies are needed to reduce confounding factors and further evaluate the impact of vitamin D treatment on the outcome of AD patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/atopic-dermatitis-meta.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=atopic-dermatitis-5x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d---aug-2019>Atopic Dermatitis 5X more likely if low Vitamin D - Aug 2019</h4><p><strong>Dose–response association between vitamin D deficiency and atopic dermatitis in children, and effect modification by gender: a case-control study</strong></p><p>Amal Ahmed Mohamed, Eman Mohamed Salah Ahmed, Youssef M.

Further research is recommended to study this association longitudinally, and to examine whether treating vitamin D deficiency may potentially improve AD.</p><hr><h4 id=atopic-dermatitis-treated-by-vitamin-d--review-of-micronutrients--march-2019>Atopic Dermatitis: treated by Vitamin D – Review of Micronutrients – March 2019</h4><p><strong>Micronutrients in Atopic Dermatitis: A Systematic Review</strong></p><p>J Altern Complement Med. 2019 Mar 26. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2018.0363.>doi: 10.1089/acm.2018.0363.</a></p><p>Vaughn AR1, Foolad N2, Maarouf M3, Tran KA3, Shi VY4.</p><p>1 Department of Dermatology, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, CA.</p><p>2 School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, CA.</p><p>3 College of Medicine, University of Arizona-Tucson, Tucson, AZ.</p><p>4 Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of Arizona-Tucson, Tucson, AZ.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) involves a complex interplay between immune system dysfunction, genetics, and environmental factors. It is well known that nutritional status is essential to a proper functioning immune system, leading to a highly debated question regarding the role of dietary factors in the pathogenesis of AD. Food allergies and elimination diets have been broadly studied in atopy; however, less consideration has been given to how vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients influence the risk for AD and severity of symptoms. This systematic review discusses evidence on how various micronutrients, including vitamins (C, E, and D) and trace minerals (zinc, selenium, iron, copper, magnesium, and strontium) are associated with AD, and how supplementation influence disease severity.</p><p>DESIGN:</p><p>A systematic search was conducted to identify the role that oral micronutrients have on AD. The authors reviewed 49 studies herein.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>While there are weak associations between vitamins C or E and AD, <strong>there is sufficient evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation provides benefit in AD patients. Deficiency of selenium and zinc may exacerbate AD</strong> . Current reports are not sufficient to confidently discern the role of other vitamins and trace minerals on AD.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Though oral micronutrients may play a role in AD, the current literature is limited, and there is a need for more comprehensive randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to truly decipher the role between oral micronutrients and AD.</p><hr><h4 id=atopic-dermatitis-treatment-needs-more-than-5000-iu-of-vitamin-d--rct-sept-2018>Atopic dermatitis treatment needs more than 5,000 IU of Vitamin D – RCT Sept 2018</h4><p><strong>Oral vitamin D3 5000 IU/day as an adjuvant in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: a randomized control trial</strong></p><p>International Journal of Dermatology 20 September 2018 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.14220>https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.14220</a></p><p>Karen Sánchez‐Armendáriz MD Ana García‐Gil MD Cesar A.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VDR and CYP24A1 have been previously associated with AD.</p><p>Objective: We sought to characterize the associations between the VDR and CYP24A1 polymorphisms and the vitamin D and lipid biochemical profile in children diagnosed with AD.</p><p>Methods: A total of 246 participants (143 patients with AD and 103 healthy controls) were enrolled in this study. Genotyping for polymorphisms in VDR (rs2239185, rs1544410, rs7975232, rs2238136, rs3782905, rs2239179, rs1540339, rs2107301, rs2239182, and rs731236) and CYP24A1 (rs2248359 and rs2296241) was performed by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction using integrated fluidic circuit technology. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D were measured, and the biochemical lipid profile was determined.</p><p>Results: Among VDR SNPs, rs2239182 exerted a protective effect against the development of AD, whereas rs2238136 was identified as a risk factor for AD. The GCC haplotype (rs2239185-G, rs1540339-C, and rs2238136-C) appeared to protect against the development of AD. rs2239182-CC was associated with higher 25(OH)D concentrations, whereas rs2238136-TT, rs2239185-GA, and rs2248359-TT were present in a large proportion of patients with serum vitamin D deficiency. rs2239185-AA, rs2239182-CC, and rs1540339-CC were associated with higher serum total cholesterol; rs2239182-TT was associated with lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and rs2239182-TC with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Both CYP24A1 SNPs (rs2296241-AA and rs2248359-TT) were associated with higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.</p><p>Conclusions: The VDR SNP rs2238136 is a risk factor for AD and other SNPs in VDR and CYP24A1, which may lead to alterations in biochemical parameters that influence the risk of AD. Our findings highlight the complex genetic basis to AD and indicate that interrelationships between different genetic factors can lead to alterations in vitamin D metabolism or lipid profiles, which in turn may influence the development of AD.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/atopic-dermatitis-and-genes.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-fights-many-skin-diseases-topical-form-might-be-best>Vitamin D fights many skin diseases, topical form might be best</h4><ul><li><a href=/posts/topical-vitamin-d-might-be-more-bio-available-than-oral style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Topical vitamin D might be more bio-available than oral – Oct 2015">Topical vitamin D</a> is especially useful for Skin diseases</li></ul><blockquote><p>   - as vitamin D is focused on the skin problem, rather than the whole body</p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=randomized-controlled-trial-using-vitamins-e-and-d-supplementation-in-atopic-dermatitis---july-2011>Randomized controlled trial using vitamins E and D supplementation in atopic dermatitis - July 2011</h4><p>J Dermatolog Treat. 2011 Jun;22(3):144-50</p><p>Javanbakht MH, Keshavarz SA, Djalali M, Siassi F, Eshraghian MR, Firooz A, Seirafi H, Ehsani AH, Chamari M, Mirshafiey A.</p><p>Department of Nutrition and Biochemistry, Faculty of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.</p><p>BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis is a chronically relapsing, highly pruritic and inflammatory skin disease.

There are different types of eczema, like allergic, contact, irritant, and nummular eczema. Several other forms have very similar symptoms. The diverse types of eczema are listed and briefly described below. <strong>Atopic dermatitis is typically a more specific set of three associated conditions occurring in the same person</strong> including eczema, allergies, and asthma. Not every component has to be present at the same time, but usually these patients are prone to all of these three related conditions.</p><hr><h4 id=types-of-eczema>Types of eczema</h4><ul><li><p>Contact eczema: a localized reaction that includes redness, itching, and burning where the skin has come into contact with an allergen (an allergy-causing substance) or with an irritant such as an irritating acid, a cleaning agent, or other chemical</p></li><li><p>Allergic contact eczema: a red, itchy, weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as poison ivy or certain preservatives in creams and lotions like Neosporin or Bacitracin</p></li><li><p>Seborrheic eczema (also called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea): is a very common form of mild skin inflammation of unknown cause that presents as yellowish, oily, scaly patches of skin on the scalp, face, ears, and occasionally other parts of the body. Often this is also called dandruff in adults or &ldquo;cradle cap&rdquo; in infants.</p></li><li><p>Nummular eczema: coin-shaped (round), isolated patches of irritated skin &ndash; most commonly on the arms, back, buttocks, and lower legs &ndash; that may be crusted, scaling, and extremely itchy</p></li><li><p>Neurodermatitis: a very particular type of dermatitis where the person frequently picks at their skin, causing rashes. The underling cause may be a sensitivity or irritation which sets off a cascade of repeated itching and scratching cycles. It may be seen as scratch marks and pick marks on the skin. Sometimes scaly patches of skin on the head, lower legs, wrists, or forearms caused by a localized itch (such as an insect bite) may become intensely irritated when scratched.</p></li><li><p>Stasis dermatitis: a skin irritation on the lower legs, generally related to circulatory problems and congestion of the leg veins. It may have a darker pigmentation, light-brown, or purplish-red discoloration from the congestion and back up of the blood in the leg veins. It&rsquo;s sometimes seen more in legs with varicose veins.</p></li></ul><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-in-atopic-dermatitis-asthma-and-allergic-diseases---aug-2010.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=seborrheic-dermatitis-42x-more-likely-if-30-ng-of-vitamin-d---feb-2021>Seborrheic Dermatitis 4.2X more likely if &lt;30 ng of Vitamin D - Feb 2021</h4><p><strong>Serum Levels of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in Patients with Seborrheic Dermatitis: A Case-Control Study</strong></p><p>Dermatol Res Pract . 2021 Feb 20;2021:6623271. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6623271>doi: 10.1155/2021/6623271</a></p><p>Siavash Rahimi 1, Negar Nemati 1, Seyedeh Sareh Shafaei-Tonekaboni 1</p><p>Several autoimmune papulosquamous skin conditions such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematous, and lichen planus have been associated with vitamin D deficiency or correlated with serum vitamin D level. This study was aimed at comparing the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status in patients with facial or scalp seborrheic dermatitis with healthy subjects. This case-control study included 289 patients (118 with psoriasis and 171 sex- and age-matched control subjects) from the outpatient clinic of two hospital dermatology departments in the west of Mazandaran province, Iran. All patients and control subjects were studied during one season to avoid seasonal variations in vitamin D levels. Serum mean ± standard deviation of 25(OH)D levels were signiﬁcantly lower in seborrheic dermatitis patients than in control subjects (20.71 ± 8.16 vs. 23.91 ± 7.78, P = 0.007).</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D levels were negatively associated with the risk of developing seborrheic dermatitis (odds ratio (OR): 0.898, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.840-0.960, P = 0.002).</p><p>Also, vitamin D under 30 ng/ml was associated with OR: 4.22 (95% Cl: 1.077-16.534, P = 0.039) for seborrheic dermatitis. The severity of scalp disease was significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D level (P = 0.003). Cases with severe scalp scores had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D level compared to moderate OR score (P = 0.036). A similar trend was not seen in the facial disease. The 25(OH)D values are signiﬁcantly lower in seborrheic dermatitis patients than in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the scalp disease severity was associated with lower serum 25(OH)D level. Our results may suggest that vitamin D may play a role in the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/seborrheic-dermatitis.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-also-web>See also web</h4><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.verywellhealth.com/eczema-and-dermatitis-4013571>Eczema and Dermatitis</a> Everwell - overview, probably nothing about Vitamin D</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22atopic%20dermatitis.%22%20%22vitamin%20d%22">Pubmed query &ldquo;atopic dermatitis.&rdquo; &ldquo;vitamin d&rdquo;</a> 402 items March 2024</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.dermatologyadvisor.com/dermatitis/atopic-dermatitis-risk-for-osteoporosis-elevated/article/774224/>Atopic Dermatitis ==> Osteopenia</a> 1.8 X</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28893022>Correlation of Vitamin D3 Levels and SCORAD Index in Atopic Dermatits: A Case Control Study.</a> Julu 2017</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>The worse the AD, the lower the Level of vitamin D.
