# Teens spend so much time with multimedia without the sun

## A higher percentage of teens are deficient now than even a decade ago - with major health consequences

# Methods to replace the vitamin D from lack of sun  include:

1. get outdoors – but hard to change any person’s behavior

> But being outdoors not help much if any of the following:

> &nbsp; &nbsp;cloudy, not middle of the day, dark skin, sun screen, wear excessive clothes, winter and far from equator

1. get vitamin D supplements – but hard to change any person’s behavior

1. Use food fortified with vitamin D – but will take decades to change fortification around the world

1. Have mothers (perhaps secretly) add vitamin D to their food 

> drops, pulverized sublingual, powder (no product available as of Feb 2012), etc.

> Somewhat similar to giving cod-liver oil ( a good source of Vitamin D and Vitamin A) a century ago, but fortunately vitamin D has no taste

1. Have a small UVB LED attached to their multimedia device/laptop

# Notes on #5: UVB LED

Need to find out the milliwatts of UVB output by LEDs

Need to study the optics – what % of UVB from LED will get to the face (30%?)

Calculate the UVB/vitamin D per 8 hours for type 1 skin

See if that amount of UVB would create any skin damage if used for years

See if the UVB intensity is such that glasses would be required (note: human eye will not see ANY light)

– virtually all glass blocks UVB, no prescription lenses needed

Expect that it can be powered by USB – first guess: LED will use less than 5% of laptop power consumption
