#### Highlights of [Report in Swedish](http://www.dagensmedicin.se/nyheter/vitamin-d-bromsade-luftvagsinfektioner/) translated by Google

* Peter Bergman and his colleagues are fortunate to have 140 patients in daily treatment for one year with either vitamin D (4000 IU) or a placebo.

* The study was double-blind: neither the patients - all of which were susceptible to infections - nor caregivers knew who belonged to which group before the trial was over.

* The results show that vitamin D reduced patient discomfort.

* The probability of requiring treatment with antibiotics during the study period was **63 %**   lower in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group, and the incidence of fungal infections, including respiratory, decreased.

 **Note: if takes ~100 days for the vitamin D levels to plateau (thus, no benefit is expected until then)** 

 **Respiratory tract infection eliminated in 36 percent of people** 

## Types of Respiratory Infections
