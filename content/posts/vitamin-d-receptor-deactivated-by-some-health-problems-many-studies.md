Some diseases may have "learned' to protect themselves by deactivating the Vitamin D Receptor

Unfortunately, when the disease leaves the body, it fails to re-activate the Vitamin D Receptor

&nbsp; &nbsp; In which case the cells may continue to have low vitamin D levels for months/years

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspect that is the case for <a href="/posts/long-covid-is-now-the-biggest-covid-concern-many-studies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Long-COVID is now the biggest COVID concern - many studies">Long-COVID</a>
