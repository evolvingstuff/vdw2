### 5 Reasons that medical professionals do not prescribe Vitamin D for Diabetes

1. No profit for Big Pharma

> > [Diabetes-A Lucrative Disease April 2023](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/diabetes-a-lucrative-disease-86c7b78c)

1. Less income for doctors or hospitals if stop diabetes

1. The Vitamin D dose needed often varies by 4X between individuals for many health problems

> Doctors prefer using a single dose of a drug for all patients

1. Doctors are unaware that small doses of vitamin D  gut-friendly can be used

> [Gut-Friendly Vitamin D](/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d) is available on Amazon, but not in pharmacies, nor by prescription

> they are uncomfortable prescribing 4,000+ IU of vitamin D

> in many countries, doctors can only prescribe D2 (which does not work as well), not D3

1. Doctors are unaware that adding Magnesium helps prevent/treat Diabetes

> they often just want to use  a monotherapy

Within the group of children with positive autoantibodies, a few children quickly developed type 1 diabetes - however this was independent from their vitamin D levels.

* "Blood glucose testing does not offer a significant advantage in blood sugar control or quality of life for patients with type 2 diabetes  **who are not treated with insulin** , according to a study published online by JAMA Internal Medicine."

* "In the MONITOR trial, 450 patients were assigned to no blood sugar monitoring, once daily glucose monitoring, or enhanced once-daily glucose monitoring with an internet-delivered tailored message of encouragement or instruction for 1 year."

* "Results showed no significant differences in blood glucose control across the 3 groups. There were no significant differences in health-related quality of life or for hypoglycemia, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits."

* "There was also no difference in the number of individuals who had to start using insulin treatment to better control blood glucose levels."
