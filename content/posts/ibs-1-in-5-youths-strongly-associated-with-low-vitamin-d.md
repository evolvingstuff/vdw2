There is no treatment of choice for irritable bowel syndrome, which affects up to 20% of school-aged children. This cross-sectional study evaluated the difference in the average vitamin D level between subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome, and the relationship between the vitamin D level as well as the severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. We included 124 adolescents aged 10–17 years (68 boys, 56 girls; mean age 12.29 ± 1.92 years) from 2014 to 2016. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were diagnosed by Rome III criteria and classified by clinical manifestation: 

* irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (n = 29), 

* irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (n = 63), and 

* irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and diarrhea (n = 32). 

The severity of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and school absence were evaluated. Vitamin D levels were measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The chi-square test and analysis of variance were used. The patients’ average vitamin D level was 16.25 ± 6.58 ng/mL. There was a significant negative association of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with symptom severity and school absence (p = 0.022 and p < 0.001, respectively). Vitamin D supplementation could be considered as a choice of therapeutic method
