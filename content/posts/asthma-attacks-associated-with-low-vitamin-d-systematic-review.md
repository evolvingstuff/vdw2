Asthma is a major public health issue. The co-occurrence of the high prevalence of asthma and vitamin D deficiency documented globally in recent decades has prompted several investigations into a possible association between the two conditions. The objective of this paper was to synthesize the evidence from studies that have measured the association between serum vitamin D and asthma incidence, prevalence, severity and exacerbations. A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, and the available evidence was summarized both qualitatively and by meta-analysis. Only English language, observational studies measuring serum levels of 25(OH)D as the exposure were included, as this is the most robust measure of vitamin D levels. The search identified 23 manuscripts: two case–control, 12 cohort and nine cross-sectional studies. Collectively, the evidence suggests that higher serum levels of 25(OH)D are associated with 

* a reduced risk of  **asthma exacerbations** , but there was 

*  **little evidence to suggest an association with asthma incidence, prevalence or severity.**  

A significant amount of heterogeneity between study methodology and results restricted the scope for meta-analysis. These results suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be effective for the prevention of asthma exacerbations, but the findings need to be confirmed by clinical trials.
