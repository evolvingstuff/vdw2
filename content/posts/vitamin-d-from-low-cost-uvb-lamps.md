#### <span style="color:#F00;">Must wear glasses when near UVB - it can damage your eyes, perhaps within minutes.</span>

Plastic contact lenses might pass UVB unless you have paid for UV blocking feature

Without UV blocking contacts you must wear glasses/ski goggles/whatever if you might look at the bulb

 **Light years2  - out of business - Update Jan 2019** 

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

Founder of VitaminDWiki bought a GE lamp fixture Jan 2019 and used UVB bulk from previous Light Year 2 fixture

Bulb is said to last 4,000 hours, so UVB bulb would cost 1 cent per hour

[GE 16466 Basic 18 Inch Fluorescent Under Cabinet Amazon $13](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJ75PW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

[G15T8E 15W Germicidal UV-B Fluorescent Lamp $25 including USPS to Seattle](https://www.replacementlightbulbs.com/lampg15t8euvbgermicidal.html)

OR &nbsp; &nbsp; [Ushio BC3286 USHIO G15T8E 14.7W Midrange UV Fluorescent Lamp Amazon $38](https://www.amazon.com/Ushio-BC3286-G15T8E-Midrange-Fluorescent/dp/B003ZAQDTY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1548641731&sr=8-1&keywords=G15T8E)

Put the bulb and fixture at top of a ladder (near the ceiling) and measured UVB at chest level 7 feet from bulb

| Reflector | Direct |

Similar reading with a direct view of the bulb and with reflector made with aluminim foil placed between the ceiling and the wall

8 IU per minute:  UVB Meter calibrated for 20% of skin area for a 20 year-old (approximately face and hands)

500 IU per hour - 20 year-old

5,000 IU per 10-hour- 20-year-old

1200 IU  per 10 hours for a senior (assumes 1/4 as much UVB created Vitamin D)

It appears that the celing paint, by itself, does not reflect any UVB

As expected, the plastic bulb cover on the GE fixture is opaque to UVB

 **UVB intensity at 2 feet across countertop** 

Countertop might reflect, so reading would be lower if no countertop

 **Intensity 85  @ 2 feet with reflector** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/uvb-al-2-feet.jpg" alt="image" width="250">

5,300 IU per hour - 20-year-old, 1300 IU senior

 **Warning: Start with very short durations** 

Try one day at  ~3 minutes, and see if get UV burn/pinking the following day

Double the time each day,until get slight burn/pinking the following day, then reduce the duration (perhaps by 1/3)

Note: Burning is more likely if:

1. Low blood level of Vitamin D

1. Same portion of skin had had UVB dose in past few days
