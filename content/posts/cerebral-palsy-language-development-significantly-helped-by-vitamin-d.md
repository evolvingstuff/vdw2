OBJECTIVE:

To observe the clinical efficacy of vitamin D auxiliary rehabilitation therapy in children with cerebral palsy and language dysfunction.

METHODS:

Eighty-two cases of children with cerebral palsy and language dysfunction in our hospital from March 2011 to June 2014 were selected for this study. They were divided into two groups: the rehabilitation treatment group (simple group, 39 cases) and the vitamin D auxiliary rehabilitation therapy group (combination group, 43 cases). After three months of treatment, language development, Gesell Child Development Scale, Bayley Infant Development Scale score and vitamin D and calcium levels were compared.

RESULTS:

The language development, Gesell Child Development Scale, Bayley Infant Development Scale score and vitamin D and calcium levels for two of the groups, after treatment, are improved compared to before treatment. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The total efficiency of the language development in the combination group was obviously higher than the simple group. The difference was significant (95.3% vs. 74.4%, X2 = 2.486, P = 0.032). The Gesell Child Development Scale improved in the combination group compared to the simple group. The difference was statistically significant <span>[(70.4 ± 11.3) vs (53.3 ±10.5), t = 3.127, P = 0.026]</span>. The proportion of normal children was significantly higher than the rehabilitation treatment group, and the difference was statistically significant (30.2% vs. 20.5%, X2 = 3.016, P = 0.029). In the combination group, the vitamin D and calcium levels were statistically increased compared to the rehabilitation treatment group. It had statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.05).

CONCLUSION:

Vitamin D auxiliary rehabilitation therapy could improve the language function and the language development status in children with cerebral palsy and language dysfunction.
