#### [Vitamin D Deficiency and Supplementation in Critical Illness -The Known Knowns and Known Unknowns](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/904809?src=rsshttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/904809?src=rss%20)

The burgeoning literature on vitamin D deficiency and supplementation over the past decade or so has generated a greater understanding of some areas but also an appreciation of the many areas of equipoise. This is particularly relevant in the field of critical care with the heterogeneous patient populations, the severity and duration of illness and the frequency of comorbid conditions.

This review aims to summarise the current knowledge base of vitamin D deficiency within the context of critical illness—"the known knowns"—and also highlight the areas of recognised uncertainty—"the known unknowns". It acknowledges the fact that there may well be other knowledge gaps of clinical relevance of which we are currently unaware—"the unknown unknowns".

#### Should we measure free vitamin D levels—the role of DBP (clipped form PDF)

As alluded to above, the majority of circulating 25 hydroxy-D and 1,25(OH)2D is tightly bound to DBP and albumin, with less than 1% circulating in an unbound form. Binding of DBP impairs delivery of 25 hydroxy-D to vitamin D-activating 1-alpha-hydroxylase in target cells. It is therefore the unbound or free form of these metabolites which is active in most cells. As a result, factors affecting DBP alter the interpretation of 25 hydroxy-D levels <sup>[54]</sup>. 

 **Levels of DBP are affected by** 

* genetic factors, 

* certain drugs (tenofovir, aspirin, oral contraceptive pill), 

* smoking, 

* hormonal factors, 

* obesity and insulin resistance, 

* end stage liver disease and 

* nephrotic syndrome <sup>[54]</sup>.

It might, therefore, be important clinically to be able to measure the free and bound fractions by using a DBP assay. However, measurement of DBP is not standardized and, as a result, it is difficult to compare the different assays and studies.

Alternatively, free 25 hydroxy-D levels can be directly measured by centrifugal ultrafiltration and a newer commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Centrifugal ultrafiltration is the gold standard but not commonly utilized as it is technically difficult, expensive and requires a very sensitive assay methodology <sup>[55]</sup>.

Gene sequencing has uncovered many variations in the DBP gene. O **ver 120 variants of DBP have been found**  and, of these, three main phenotypic variants have been described. The variants have different characteristics that can alter 25 hydroxy-D levels. Powe et al.<sup>[56]</sup> demonstrated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that variations in race altered DBP levels and no change in DBP occurred with replacement of vitamin D. In addition, black subjects were found to have lower DBP levels than non-black subjects, resulting in similar concentrations of estimated bioavailable 25 hydroxy-D.

 **In critically ill patients, DBP falls during the systemic inflammatory response** , which theoretically is related to a fall in 25 hydroxy-D. This was discovered in a study performed on patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery who were found to have elevated acute phase reactants <sup>[57]</sup>.

A study performed on ICU patients showed that bactericidal activity was associated with 25 hydroxy-D concentrations, and  **DBP was decreased in patients with sepsis**  in comparison to subjects without sepsis <sup>[58]</sup>. A paediatric intensive care study found that levels of DBP and total 25 hydroxy-D were lower than those reported in healthy children. The lower DBP levels increased bioavailability of 25 hydroxy-D but the calculated bioavail- able 25 hydroxy-D levels were also inversely associated with illness severity <sup>[59]</sup>.

Therefore, total 25 hydroxy-D might not be a reliable indicator in the critical care situation. Overall, assessing vitamin D status and its activity in ICU patients, the implication of free or bound vitamin all contribute to the complexity of designing trials in this area.

On the other hand, Martucci et al. <sup>[60]</sup> undertook a post-hoc analysis of the VITdAL-ICU trial patients where DBP was measured in stored samples. They found that high dose cholecalciferol increased both total and bioavailable vitamin D metabolites in a similar way. Calculating free levels, however, did not enhance the ability to predict mortality when compared to 25 hydroxy-D alone, suggesting that there may not be an additional benefit to analyzing free vitamin D levels.
