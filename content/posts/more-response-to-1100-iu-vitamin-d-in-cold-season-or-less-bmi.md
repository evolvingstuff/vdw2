Objective: It is well documented that there is wide variation in the response of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> to a given dose of vitamin D supplementation. Understanding factors affecting the response variation is important for identifying subjects who are susceptible to vitamin D deficiency or toxicity. This study aimed to evaluate potential predictors for vitamin D response variation.

Design and Participants: A total of 1179 non-Hispanic white postmenopausal women were enrolled into a 4-yr calcium and vitamin D (1100 IU/d) clinical trial. Among them, serum 25(OH)D level of 1063 subjects were measured at both baseline and after 12 months treatment. Vitamin D response was computed for these 1063 subjects as the difference in levels of serum 25(OH)D concentration at the end of a 12-month vitamin D treatment compared with baseline. Stepwise linear regression was used to identify predictors of vitamin D response variation.

Results: 

* <span style="color:#F00;">Increase in vitamin D intake,</span> 

* <span style="color:#F00;">baseline serum 25(OH)D level, </span>

* baseline blood collection  **season** , 

* baseline serum calcium level, and 

* baseline body mass index 

were predictors of vitamin D response variation. 

These five factors explained  **46.8% of the vitamin D response variation**  in the 1063 subjects. 

The first three factors <span>[~~#F00:[increase in vitamin D intake, baseline serum 25(OH)D level, baseline blood collection season~~]</span> remained as predictors in the 392 subjects with trial vitamin D supplementation. 

For the first time, our study indicated that  **season is an important prediction factor**  for vitamin D response variation. 

 **Subjects who started vitamin D treatment in a cold season (autumn and winter) achieved a significantly higher serum 25(OH)D increase than those started in a hot season (summer) (P < 0.001).** 

Conclusion: Our study suggests that the increase in vitamin D supplementation, baseline serum 25(OH)D level, and the season when initiating the vitamin D supplementation can partially predict vitamin D response variation in non-Hispanic postmenopausal women.
