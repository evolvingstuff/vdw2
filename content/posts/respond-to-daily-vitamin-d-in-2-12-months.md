#### Many Vitamin D trials last 3 months or less

#### However, sometimes responses do not plateau for 4-12 months

#### No one seems to know why some people respond slowly

#### Slow responses might be due to differences in

   * Note: Activation/deactivation of 6 genes is not noticed by a vitamin D blood test

* Age
