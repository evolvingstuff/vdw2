#### [What’s in the CDC’s Zika Prevention Kits, From Permethrin to Condoms](http://www.wired.com/2016/08/heres-whats-cdc-zika-prevention-kits/) Wired

 **The US congress has not provided money for the CDC to provide these kits. They are just recommendations** 

*  **Standing Water Treatment Tablets** 

> A bacterial toxin specific to mosquito larva

> A pack of six costs around $10 and mosquito-proofs 100 square feet of water for 30 days.

*  **Permethrin Spray** 

> “If a mosquito lands on permethrin-treated fabric and stays there, it will kill the mosquito,”

> “A 6.5 ounce can costs $6, and will treat two outfits for two weeks.”

*  **Bed Net** 

> “If you’re in a lighted room at night and there’s a hungry Aedes aegypti mosquito around, it will still bite you,”

> “An inexpensive bed net costs $10 to $15.”

> “They land on your skin and don’t realize it’s something they can feed on.” 

> Note [study](http://phys.org/news/2011-09-deet-insects.html) was based on fruit flies, not mosquitoes

> “Repellents containing DEET, which last longer, usually run $6 to $10 a bottle.
