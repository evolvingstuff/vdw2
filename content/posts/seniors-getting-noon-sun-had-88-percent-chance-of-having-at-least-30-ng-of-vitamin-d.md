Background: Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin under the action of solar ultraviolet-B radiation. The objective of this study was to determine whether a simple question exploring sun exposure  **(When weather is nice, do you stay more than 15 minutes exposed to the sun (face and hands uncovered) between 11am and 3pm?)**  could be associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status among 751 older community-dwelling women ( **mean age, 80.2**  ± 3.5 years). 

Methods: Two groups were distinguished based on the binary Yes versus No answer. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 30 ng/mL. 

Results: Fewer women with hypovitaminosis D answered Yes to the question on sun exposure (p = 0.042). 

Answering Yes was inversely associated with hypovitaminosis D (OR = 0.56, p = 0.049) after adjustment for  **demographic characteristics**  and exogenous sources of vitamin D, with a positive predictive value of 88 %. 

Conclusion: This simple question may reflect the sun's influence on vitamin D status and identify older community-dwellers with hypovitaminosis D.
