According to the results of a pair of [large clinical trials](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/22/10/b29178704/merck-and-ridgeback-biotherapeutics-provide-update-on-new-clinical-and-non-clinical-studies-of-lag?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site), Merck’s experimental antiviral pill failed to lower the risks of COVID-19 hospitalization and death among adults at higher risk from the disease. The company, in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. conducted two real-world evidence studies evaluating the drug, molnupiravir, In a trial of more than 25,000 people by researchers at Oxford University, the oral antiviral helped shorten the recovery time of acute infection but showed no substantial benefit compared to taking a placebo in most serious adverse COVID-related events. In a separate study conducted in Israel, real-world data showed that while molnupiravir reduced hospitalizations and mortality due to COVID-19 in patients 65 years and above, “no evidence of benefit was found in younger adults ages 40 to 64 years.”  [SF Chronicle](ttps://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/COVID-in-California-live-updates-17492211.php)
