### Emerging Practice Concerning Vitamin D in Primary Care.

[Qual Health Res. 2014 Oct 7. ](http://qhr.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/10/07/1049732314554100.long%20)pii: 1049732314554100. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>  **<span style="color:#F00;">$30</span>**

The establishment of practice patterns concerning the diagnosis and management of hypovitaminosis D seems to be heterogeneous among primary care physicians. 

We conducted a qualitative study to explore the emerging practices among primary care providers regarding screening and treatment for hypovitaminosis D, as well as factors that influence practice patterns. 

Trained researchers facilitated focus groups among primary care providers. 

We followed a grounded theory approach to transcript coding and analysis using ATLAS.ti analysis software. 

Testing or screening for hypovitaminosis D and subsequent replacement or supplementation practices varied among participants. 

Emerging practice concerning vitamin D appears to be constructed and reinforced by 

* patient demand; 

* incidental reading; 

* brief, purposeful research; 

* conversations with colleagues; 

* results of consultations by specialists; 

* and more patient demand. 

A multifaceted approach to promoting guideline adherence will be required to influence this practice.
