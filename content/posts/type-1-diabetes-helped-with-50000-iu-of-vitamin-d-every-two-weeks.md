AIM:

Studies show the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and glucose metabolism disorders. The aim of this study is evaluation of the effect of vitamin D administration in management of diabetes mellitus type 1.

METHODS:

We evaluated the effect of supplementation with vitamin D on HbA1c levels of children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1. In this before-after study, 70 subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 were enrolled. Fasting serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, glucose and HbA1c were measured at the initiation and after the administration of 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 biweekly for 3 months. The results were then compared using paired t-test. Between 70 patients, Five patients excluded from the study because they did not completed the study and finally, 65 subjects finished the study.

RESULTS:

Finally, 65 patients including 35 children and 30 adolescents were recruited. Forty three (66.1%) subjects had vitamin D deficiency (<30ng/ml). Vitamin D administration leads to decrease of fast blood sugar and HbA1c levels significantly in treated group without effect on calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels. So, No significant alterations occurred in calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels after supplementation with vitamin D.

CONCLUSION:

This study showed that HbA1c may be reduced by administration of vitamin D to children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus type 1 without changing the dose of insulin.
