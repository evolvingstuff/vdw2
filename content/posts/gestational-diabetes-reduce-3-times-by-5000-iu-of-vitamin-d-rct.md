#### Gestational Diabetes treated by 50,000 IU  of vitamin D every 2 weeks + daily probiotic - Nov 2018

 **The effects of vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation on glucose homeostasis, inflammation, oxidative stress and pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial** 

Clinical Nutrition, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.10.028

Background and aims This study was designed to assess the effects of combined vitamin D and probiotic supplementation on metabolic status and pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes (GDM).

Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 87 women with GDM. Patients were randomly assigned three groups to receive either vitamin D (50,000 IU/every 2 weeks) plus probiotic (8×109 CFU/day) (n=30), probiotic (8×109 CFU/day) (n=29) or placebo (n=28) for 6 weeks.

Results: Vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation significantly reduced 

* fasting plasma glucose (β -10.99 mg/dL; 95% CI, -14.26, -7.73; P<0.001), 

* serum insulin levels (β -1.95 μIU/mL; 95% CI, -3.05, -0.84; P=0.001) and

* homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (β -0.76; 95% CI, -1.06, -0.45; P<0.001), and 

significantly increased

* the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (β 0.01; 95% CI, 0.008, 0.03; P=0.001) compared with the placebo.

In addition, vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation resulted in a 

* significant reduction in triglycerides (β -37.56 mg/dL; 95% CI, -51.55, -23.56; P<0.001), 

* VLDL- (β -7.51 mg/dL; 95% CI, -10.31, -4.71; P<0.001), 

* HDL-/total cholesterol ratio (β -0.52; 95% CI, -0.79, -0.24; P<0.001), 

* high sensitivity C-reactive protein (β -1.80 mg/L; 95% CI, -2.53, -1.08; P<0.001) and 

* malondialdehyde (β -0.43 μmol/L; 95% CI, -0.77, -0.09; P=0.01); 

also, a significant rise in 

* HDL-cholesterol (β 4.09 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.11, 7.08; P=0.008) and 

* total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels (β 97.77 mmol/L; 95% CI, 52.34, 143.19; P<0.001) were observed compared with the placebo. 

Vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation did not change other metabolic parameters. 

Vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation significantly decreased triglycerides (P=0.02), VLDL-cholesterol (P=0.02) and hs-CRP (P=0.01), and significantly increased TAC (P=0.006) and total glutathione levels (P=0.04) compared with only probiotic group.

Conclusions: In conclusion, vitamin D and probiotic co-supplementation in women with GDM had beneficial effects on metabolic status.
