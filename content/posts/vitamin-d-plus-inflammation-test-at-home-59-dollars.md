#### [Everlywell](https://www.everlywell.com/products/vitamin-d-and-inflammation-test/%20)

Uses a blood spot test -which are typically fairly accurate

This one test measures both Vitamin D and C Reactive Protein

 **“Chronic inflammation has been implicated in a wide variety of disorders, including:”** 

Heart Disease, Diabetes, Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, Lupus, Crohn's Disease, Cancer

 **Observations by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki** 

I just became aware of this Everly test this month

They have about 20 other home tests

Most home vitamin D tests cost ~ $50

Have no knowledge of Everly reliability nor accuracy

Looks promising - adds an inflammation test at little extra cost

&nbsp; &nbsp; Amazingly their Vitamin D-only test costs more than their Vit D + Inflammation test

Quarterly subscription - price reduction of 20%

Appear that it takes ~ 1 week to get the results back via email

Do not know if they ship outside of the US
