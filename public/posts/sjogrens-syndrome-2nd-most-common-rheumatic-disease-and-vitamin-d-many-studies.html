Multiple studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in autoimmune diseases. Recently, a possible protective role of vitamin D in autoimmunity has been described; however, this function remains controversial. Few studies have investigated the role of vitamin D in patients with Sjögren syndrome (SS). In this review, we compiled the main features of SS pathogenesis, the vitamin D immunomodulatory effects and the possible interaction between both. Data suggests that vitamin D may play a role in the SS pathogenesis. In addition, vitamin D low levels have been found in SS patients, which are associated with extra-glandular manifestations, such as lymphoma or neuropathy, suggesting a possible benefit effect of vitamin D in SS.</p><p><strong>Abbreviations</strong> APC, Antigen-presenting cell; BAFF, B-cell activating factor; DBP, vitamin D-binding protein; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; RA, Rheumatoid arthritis; SLE, Systemic lupus erythematosus; SS, Sjögren syndrome; Treg, T regulatory cell; VDR, <strong>Vitamin D receptor</strong> ; VDRE, Vitamin D response element</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/sj-gren-2017-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci=hub VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h2 id=novel-aspects-of-sjögrens-syndrome-in-2012>Novel aspects of Sjögren’s syndrome in 2012</h2><p>BMC Medicine 2013, 11:93 doi:10.1186/1741-7015-11-93</p><p>Angela Tincani 1,2*, Laura Andreoli 2, Ilaria Cavazzana 1, Andrea Doria 3, Marta Favero 3, Maria-Giulia Fenini 4, Franco Franceschini 1, Andrea Lojacono 5, Giuseppe Nascimbeni 6, Amerigo Santoro 7, Francesco Semeraro 6, Paola Toniati1 and Yehuda Shoenfeld 8 * *Corresponding author: Angela Tincani <a href=mailto:tincani@med.unibs.it>tincani@med.unibs.it</a></p><p>1 Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Spedali Civili, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, 25100 Brescia, Italy</p><p>2 Chair of Rheumatology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Spedali Civili, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, 25100 Brescia, Italy</p><p>3 Rheumatology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Azienda Ospedaliera di Padova, Via Giustiniani 2, Padua, 35128, Italy</p><p>4 Rheumatology Unit, Vallecamonica Hospital, Via Manzoni 142, Esine (Brescia), 25040, Italy</p><p>5 Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Spedali Civili and University of Brescia, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, Brescia, 25100, Italy</p><p>6 Ophthalmology Unit, Spedali Civili and University of Brescia, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, Brescia, 25100, Italy</p><p>7 Pathology Unit, Spedali Civili, Piazzale Spedali Civili 1, Brescia, 25100, Italy</p><p>8 Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Hashomer, 52621, Israel</p><p>Received: 19 November 2012; Accepted: 15 February 2013; Published: 4 April 2013</p><p>Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is a systemic progressive autoimmune disease characterized by a complex pathogenesis requiring a predisposing genetic background and involving immune cell activation and autoantibody production. The immune response is directed to the exocrine glands, causing the typical ‘sicca syndrome’, but major organ involvement is also often seen. The etiology of the disease is unknown. Infections could play a pivotal role: compared to normal subjects, patients with SS displayed higher titers of anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early antigens, but lower titers of other infectious agent antibodies such as rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) suggest that some infections may have a protective role against the development of autoimmune disease. Recent findings seem to show that low <strong>vitamin D</strong> levels in patients with SS could be associated with severe complications such as lymphoma and peripheral neuropathy. This could open new insights into the disease etiology. The current treatments for SS range from symptomatic therapies to systemic immunosuppressive drugs, especially B cell-targeted drugs in cases of organ involvement. Vitamin D supplementation may be an additional tool for optimization of SS treatment.</p><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><h2 id=sections-on-vitamin-d-clipped-from-the-pdf>Sections on vitamin D clipped from the PDF</h2><h3 id=novel-aspects-of-ss-the-role-of-infections-and-vitamin-d-infections-and-ss>Novel aspects of SS: the role of infections and vitamin D Infections and SS</h3><p>The etiology of autoimmune diseases (AID) is multifactorial where genetic, immunologic, hormonal and environmental factors play in concert in their induction. The final step determining the date of emergence of an AID is most probably an environmental trigger, which is generally of infectious origin <sup>[73]</sup>. In the interplay between infectious agents and autoimmunity it was found that the same infectious agent (that is, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)) may be involved in inducing many autoimmune diseases, while the same autoimmune disease may be caused by various agents (that is, EBV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Helicobacter pylori, and so on) <sup>[74]</sup>.</p><p>Recently, several multicenter studies analyzed a large number of sera samples (>2,500) from patients with AID such as SS, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), RA, vasculitides, and others for the presence of a profile of anti-infectious agents antibodies including EBV, CMV, H. pylori,rubella,treponema,Herpesvirus and toxoplasmosis. In several diseases a higher prevalence and titers of anti-infectious antibodies were found compared with healthy controls matched for sex, age and ethnicity <span>[75-80]</span>. For instance, in patients with SS the prevalence and titers of antibodies against EBV-early antigen were significantly higher than in their control group (P = 0.0003).</p><p>Interestingly, in some diseases lower titers of anti-infectious agents were found, such as the lower prevalence and titers of rubella and CMV antibodies (IgM) detected in patients with SS compared to controls (P &lt;0.02). This may allude indirectly to the notion that some infectious agents may have a protective rather thanapathogenicrole for a specific autoimmune disease.</p><p>Furthermore, a certain infectious agent may determine why an individual with the &lsquo;proper&rsquo; genetic background will develop one AID rather than others, as well as its clinical manifestations and severity.</p><h3 id=low-levels-of-vitamin-d-are-associated-with-neuropathy-and-lymphoma-among-patients-with-ss>Low levels of vitamin D are associated with neuropathy and lymphoma among patients with SS</h3><p>The morbidity of SS is mainly determined by extraglandular disease and increased prevalence of lymphoma.

The clinical picture of SS ranges from exocrinopathy to systemic disease affecting the lung, kidney, liver, skin, musculockeletal and nervous systems. The morbidity of SS is mainly determined by extraglandular disease and increased prevalence of lymphoma. Environmental and hormonal factors, such as vitamin-D may play a role in the pathogenic process and disease expression. Thus, we aimed to evaluate levels of vitamin-D and their association with manifestations of SS.</p><p>METHODS: Vitamin-D levels were determined in 176 primary SS patients and 163 matched healthy volunteers utilizing the LIAISON chemiluminescent immunoassays (DiaSorin-Italy). A correlation between vitamin-D levels and clinical and serological manifestations of SS was performed.</p><p>RESULTS: Mean vitamin-D levels were comparable between SS patients and control 21.2 ± 9.4 ng/ml and 22.4 ± 10 ng/ml, respectively. Peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed in 23% of SS patients and associated with lower vitamin-D levels (18.6 ± 5.5 ng/ml vs. 22.6±8 ng/ml (p = 0.04)). Lymphoma was diagnosed in 4.3% of SS patients, who had lower levels of vitamin-D (13.2 ± 6.25 ng/ml), compared to SS patients without lymphoma (22 ± 8 ng/ml), (p = 0.03). Other clinical and serological manifestations did not correlate with vitamin-D status.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, low levels of vitamin-D correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy and lymphoma among SS patients. The link between vitamin-D and neuropathy or lymphoma was reported in other conditions, and may support a role for vitamin-D in the pathogenesis of these processes. Plausible beneficial effect for vitamin-D supplementation may thus be suggested.</p><hr><h2 id=clips-from-wikipedia-april-2013>Clips from Wikipedia April 2013</h2><p>Nine out of ten Sjögren&rsquo;s patients are women<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> and the average age of onset is after menopause in women, although Sjögren&rsquo;s occurs in all age groups in both women and men.</p><p>It is estimated to affect as many as 4 million people in the United States alone, making it the second most common rheumatic disease.</p><p>The hallmark symptom of Sjögren&rsquo;s syndrome is a generalized dryness, typically including xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes), part of what are known as sicca symptoms.</p><p>In addition, Sjögren&rsquo;s syndrome may cause skin, nose, and vaginal dryness, and may affect other organs of the body, including the kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, pancreas, peripheral nervous system (distal axonal sensorimotor neuropathy) and brain.</p><p>The overall prevalence of Sjögren’s Syndrome is estimated to be between 0.2 and 0.65% of the total population.</p><hr><h2 id=mega-doses-of-vitamin-d-reduces-sjögrens-fatigue-for-one-person>Mega Doses Of Vitamin D reduces Sjögren’s fatigue for one person</h2><p><a href=https://sjodry.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/sjodrys-drag-race/>SjoDry’s Drag Race</a> Sep 2015</p><p>Does not state how much was used</p><p>Includes the following description</p><p>A chronic, slowly progressive autoimmune disease that affects the “exocrine” (moisture producing) glands of the body.
