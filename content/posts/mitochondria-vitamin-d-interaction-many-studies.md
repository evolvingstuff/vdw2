#### Resveratrol and Vitamin D: Eclectic Molecules Promoting Mitochondrial Health in Sarcopenia - July 2024

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25(14), 7503; [FREE PDF](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25147503)

Sarcopenia refers to the progressive loss and atrophy of skeletal muscle function, often associated with aging or secondary to conditions involving systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that skeletal muscle function is not only influenced by physical, environmental, and genetic factors but is also significantly impacted by nutritional deficiencies. Natural compounds with antioxidant properties, such as resveratrol and vitamin D, have shown promise in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle cells. These antioxidants can slow down muscle atrophy by regulating mitochondrial functions and neuromuscular junctions. This review provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms leading to skeletal muscle atrophy and summarizes recent advances in using resveratrol and vitamin D supplementation for its prevention and treatment. Understanding these molecular mechanisms and implementing combined interventions can optimize treatment outcomes, ensure muscle function recovery, and improve the quality of life for patients.

#### Steroid Hormone Synthesis in Mitochondria - April 2015

Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2013 Apr 26. pii: S0303-7207(13)00159-7. [doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2013.04.014.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2013.04.014.)

Mitochondria are essential sites for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mitochondria in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal, gonad, placenta and brain contain the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, and its two electron-transfer partners, ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. This enzyme system converts cholesterol to pregnenolone and determines net steroidogenic capacity, so that it serves as the chronic regulator of steroidogenesis. Several other steroidogenic enzymes, including 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase also reside in mitochondria. 

Similarly, the mitochondria of renal tubular cells contain  **two key enzymes participating in the activation and degradation of vitamin D** . The access of cholesterol to the mitochondria is regulated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, StAR, serving as the acute regulator of steroidogenesis. StAR action requires a complex multi-component molecular machine on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Components of this machine include the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), the voltage-dependent anion chanel (VDAC-1), TSPO-associated protein 7 (PAP7, ACBD3), and protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1α (PKAR1A). The precise fashion in which these proteins interact and move cholesterol from the OMM to P450scc, and the means by which cholesterol is loaded into the OMM, remain unclear. Human deficiency diseases have been described for StAR and for all the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes, but not for the electron transfer proteins or for the components of the cholesterol import machine.
