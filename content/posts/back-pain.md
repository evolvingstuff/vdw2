 **MAGNESIUM (clipped from PDF)** 

Background

Magnesium acts as an NMDA receptor antago­nist,  **blunting central nervous system sensitiza­tion to pain**  <sup>[36]</sup>. It is currently available in a variety of forms including magnesium oxide, citrate, and chloride. The most common adverse effects of magnesium are nausea, vom­iting, and diarrhea. Magnesium also may inter­fere with coagulation and cause increased bruising and bleeding in those with clotting disorders. At toxic doses, magnesium may lead to hypotension, muscle weakness, depressed reflexes, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Randomized Controlled Trials  **(2 weeks infravenous then 4 weeks oral; pain relieved for 6 months)** 

A 2012 double-blinded RCT evaluated magne­sium therapy in patients with chronic low back pain with a neuropathic component <sup>[37]</sup>. All enrolled patients received gabapentin 300 mg orally three times daily, amitriptyline hydrochloride 25 mg orally at bedtime, and celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily. Treatment (magnesium) group patients received an intra­venous infusion of magnesium sulfate 1 g in 250 ml saline 0.9% given over 4 h every day for 2 weeks. This infusion was then replaced with oral magnesium therapy twice daily for 4 weeks using capsules containing magnesium oxide 400 mg and magnesium gluconate 100 mg. All patients rated their pain intensity using an independent pain physician and an 11-point numeric scale (NRS). Patients in the placebo and treatment groups reported a statistically signif­icant reduction in pain intensity at 2 weeks. However, this  **pain reduction continued throughout the 6-month follow-up period only among patients receiving magnesium therapy** . The researchers concluded that magnesium therapy contributed to a significant reduction in chronic pain intensity at 6 months compared with both baseline and control group values <sup>[37]</sup>.

Summary

Studies evaluating the use of magnesium in chronic low back pain are currently limited. However, existing evidence demonstrates an improvement over placebo for patients with chronic low back pain with a neuropathic component. Overall, magnesium appears to be a viable treatment option for those who have failed conventional treatment; however, further research is needed to identify the optimum dose and period of treatment.

#### Back Pain relief experience - Henry Lahore, admin of VitaminDWiki, Dec 2014

The following combination worked great - pain for only 3 days instead of the typical 10 days

Pain went from 8 ==> 3 on this [visual scale](/posts/400000-iu-of-vitamin-d-reduced-adult-pain-and-improved-quality-of-life)

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/visual-analog-pain-scale.gif" alt="image" width="350">

Back pain relief is probably due to one or more of the following:

1) Vitamin D - 50,000 IU - sublingual to get it to the bloodstream in a few hours instead of 12-20 hours

2) Magnesium Chloride - both topical twice a day and internal - I used 1 teaspoon (160 ml) every two hours, total ~ 800 mg/day

Previously had been taking about 50 mg/day ( realized after)

note: horses get 1600 mg/day Mg continuously in their feed

#### UK review of Back Pain - asking for comments March 2016

* The words Omega-3 and Magnesium do not exist in the PDF

* "Studies have linked low vitamin D levels to back pain, but the evidence of causation not clear."

* There have been no random controlled clinical trials for Back Pain and vitamin D so the UK was not interested

> Note: 13 years before this study it was found that 95% of back pain was reduced with vitamin D - not an RCT

#### Notes on Low back pain in recent times:less exercise, outdoors less (low vitamin D)

Manual and often outdoors ==> “Labor-saving devices” and less time outdoors

Clothes manual ==> washers and driers

lawn manual ==> powered mower

Edging manual ==> powered edger

Weeding manual ==> chemical

Golf carry clubs while walking ==> electric cart

#### Pain relievers can extend the duration of back pain - and sometimes turning it into a chronic pain - May 2022

 **[Common Medications Can Prolong Back Pain, Study Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/health/medications-back-pain-overuse.html) New York Times** 

* "Guidelines from professional medical societies already say that people with back pain should start with nondrug treatments like exercise, physical therapy, heat or massage. Those measures turn out to be as effective as pain-suppressing drugs, without the same side effects."

* Biobank stiudy found ...2,163 people with acute back pain, 461 of whom went on to have chronic pain. Those taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory had  **nearly double the chance of developing chronic back pain**  as those taking other drugs or no drugs, the researchers found.

* "An analysis of randomized clinical trials found that these drugs had almost no benefit over placeboes in reducing low back pain."

#### By what mechanism does magnesium relieve back pain? Perplexity AI - May 2024

Magnesium relieves back pain through several mechanisms, primarily by its action on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and its role in muscle relaxation and inflammation reduction.

 **NMDA Receptor Antagonism** 

One of the primary mechanisms through which magnesium relieves back pain is by acting as an antagonist at the NMDA receptors. The NMDA receptor is a type of glutamate receptor that plays a significant role in pain transmission and central sensitization, a condition where the central nervous system becomes sensitized to pain stimuli, leading to an exaggerated pain response. Magnesium inhibits calcium ions from entering cells by blocking these receptors, which prevents central sensitization and attenuates preexisting pain hypersensitivity. This action helps in reducing the excessive stimulation of the brain chemical NMDA, which is a major mechanism of pain.

 **Muscle Relaxation** 

Magnesium also aids in muscle relaxation, which can significantly alleviate muscle tension and spasms that often contribute to back pain. Magnesium's role in muscle function is well-documented; it is essential for proper muscle contraction and relaxation. By helping muscles to relax, magnesium can reduce muscle tightness and spasms, leading to relief from back pain. This is particularly beneficial for conditions like chronic lower back pain, where muscle tension can exacerbate the pain.

 **Anti-inflammatory Effects** 

In addition to its role in muscle relaxation and NMDA receptor antagonism, magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation is a common cause of back pain, and by reducing inflammation, magnesium can help alleviate pain. Magnesium's ability to prevent cartilage breakdown and reduce the likelihood of inflammatory immune responses that damage cells and tissues contributes to its effectiveness in managing back pain. This anti-inflammatory action is crucial for conditions like arthritis, where inflammation plays a significant role in pain.

 **Additional Mechanisms** 

Magnesium also plays a role in improving the overall health of the nervous system and supporting energy production in the body. It is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions, including those necessary for energy production, which can indirectly affect the body's ability to manage pain. Furthermore, magnesium's ability to improve sleep quality can also contribute to pain relief, as poor sleep is often associated with increased pain sensitivity.In summary, magnesium relieves back pain through a combination of mechanisms, including antagonism at the NMDA receptors, muscle relaxation, anti-inflammatory effects, and support of overall nervous system health. These actions make magnesium an effective option for managing back pain, as evidenced by various studies and clinical practices.

Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks).

Alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies

Approximately 9 to 12% of people (632 million) have LBP at any given point in time, and nearly 25% report having it at some point over any one-month period.<sup>[19]</sup><sup>[20]</sup>

About 40% of people have LBP at some point in their lives,<sup>[19]</sup> with estimates as high as 80% among people in the developed world.

The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause<sup>[5]</sup> but is believed to be the result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Magnesium?
