It appears that there may be some guidance as to how much and what kind of viatmin D a person should take.

They would be similar in some ways to the rules fo playing the bridge card game,

Not precise/exact rules, but rules which work out fairly well. (statistically)

I need to look into the ways that the medical profession documents rules for prescribing.

Starting in the middle of the rules (after attempting to restore optimum vitamin D levels with 400,000 to 600,000 IU spread over 2 to6 weeks)

IF, after 8 weeks of retoring vitamin D the persons still has: (guess = 10% of the people have 1 or more of the following)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="/posts/pain-in-breastboneshinbones-free-self-test" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2095">Pain in breastbone/shinbones - free, self test</a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OR still has symptoms of vitamin D deficiency 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OR Vitamin D test results < 30 ng

THEN

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gut/liver may be limiting factors -try gut/liver-friendly vitamin D supplements for 4 weeks

ELSE (that is: no pain, no symptoms, and have > 30 ng)

? ?  did the person have pain and symptoms before and they went away, or not ? ?
