#### Short Stature if low on Vitamin K2 - May 2025

 **Vitamin K2 deficiency associated with short stature in children: a cross-sectional study** 

BMC Pediatr. 2025 May 1;25(1):348. [doi: 10.1186/s12887-025-05699-1.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-025-05699-1.)

Background: Short stature in children is a common concern that can result from various underlying conditions. While factors such as growth hormone deficiency and nutritional deficiencies are well-known contributors, the role of vitamin K2 (VK2) in the development of short stature remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the association between VK2 status and short stature in children.

Methods: A total of 730 children aged 3-16 years were enrolled and divided into three groups: short stature group (n = 191), near-short stature group (n = 357), and normal stature group (n = 182). Clinical characteristics and growth-related indicators including serum VK2 levels, bone mineral density (BMD), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) were collected. VK2 was analyzed both as a categorical variable (VK2 deficiency vs. normal status) and as a continuous variable, logistic regression models were applied to assess the association between VK2 status and short stature using both approaches. Correlations between VK2 status and other growth-related indicators were also examined.

Results: The prevalence of VK2 deficiency was higher in children with short stature (80.6%) and near-short stature (64.7%) compared to those with normal stature (32.4%) (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression models showed that higher serum VK2 levels were significantly associated with a decreased risk of short stature (aOR = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.001-0.036) and near-short stature (aOR = 0.023, 95% CI: 0.006-0.085); and

VK2 deficiency was significantly associated with increased risk of short stature (aOR = 5.934, 95% CI: 3.372-10.443) and near-short stature (aOR = 3.233, 95% CI: 2.095-4.989) after adjusting for covariates.

Additionally, serum VK2 levels were positively correlated with IGF-1-SDS and 25(OH)D (P < 0.05).

Conclusions: VK2 deficiency was significantly associated with an increased risk of short stature in children. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to elucidate the causal relationship between VK2 deficiency and growth disorders in pediatric populations.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nutrient | Risk Factors for Deficiency Related to Short Stature | Estimated Numeric Value of Risk Factor* |
|  **Zinc**  | Low dietary intake, malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, increased needs, low SES | Up to 1.8x higher risk of stunting (estimate) |
|  **Iron**  | Low intake, vegetarian diet, chronic blood loss, rapid growth, poor absorption | 2.27x higher risk of stunting with IDA |
|  **Calcium**  | Low dairy intake, lactose intolerance, exclusive breastfeeding, limited fortified foods | ~1.3x higher risk of stunting (estimate) |
|  **Vitamin D**  | Limited sun, dark skin, exclusive breastfeeding, malabsorption, low dietary intake | 0.6 cm/year less growth (deficiency vs. normal) |
|  **Vitamin A**  | Low animal/plant intake, malabsorption, poverty, frequent infections | 1.2–1.5x higher odds of stunting (estimate) |
|  **Vitamin B12**  | Vegetarian/vegan diet, maternal deficiency, malabsorption, exclusive BF by deficient mom | 1.4x higher risk of growth faltering (estimate) |
|  **Vitamin K2**  | Low fermented/animal food intake, gut dysbiosis, antibiotics, malabsorption | OR = 1.54 (short stature with VK2 deficiency) |
|  **Protein**  | Low intake, food insecurity, restrictive diet, chronic illness, malabsorption | 1.3–1.5x higher risk of stunting (estimate) |
|  **Fat**  | Low-fat diet, malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, limited access, metabolic disorders | 1.2x higher risk of stunting (estimate) |
