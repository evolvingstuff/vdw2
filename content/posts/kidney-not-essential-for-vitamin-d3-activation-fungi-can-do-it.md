### Microbial production of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 from vitamin D3.

Nat Prod Res. 2014 Jan 23. [doi: 10.1080/14786419.2013.872104](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2013.872104)   Publisher charges $46 for the PDF

The microbial transformation of vitamin D3 (1) by the fungi Candida maltosa R42 and Botrytis allii NRRL 2502 was investigated. Incubation of compound 1 with C. maltosa R42 and B. allii NRRL 2502 produced the same three more polar metabolites in small yields. The main metabolite was identified as 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (2). This biotransformation has utility as a possible tool for the production of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 from the readily available vitamin D3 for patients with compromised kidney function.
