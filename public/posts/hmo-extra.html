The aim of this project is to examine the proportion of UK schoolchildren with sufficient and optimal vitamin D status and see how this relates to their seasonal sunlight exposure levels and oral vitamin D intake.</p><p>Findings: Professor Rhodes&rsquo; team will investigate how much sun exposure modern schoolchildren (aged between 12 and 14) are actually getting and how skin and dietary sources of vitamin D contribute to vitamin D status throughout the year. The children&rsquo;s vitamin D status will be assessed each season by taking blood samples. The children will also personally measure their ultraviolet radiation exposure using a specialised tool known as a dosimeter. Oral vitamin D intake will be recorded with questionnaires. The findings will inform the re-evaluation of current national guidelines related to recommended vitamin D levels, exposure to sunlight and vitamin D intake in children.</p><p>Patient benefit: The findings from this research will help to provide more informed advice on measures to be taken to increase the benefits of vitamin D in children, whilst minimising risks of skin cancer.</p><hr><h3 id=bupa-urges-everyone-to-take-vitamin-d-to-reduce-risk-of-cancer---dec-2009>BUPA URGES EVERYONE TO TAKE VITAMIN D TO REDUCE RISK OF CANCER - Dec 2009</h3><p>As the winter solstice approaches, the shortest day of the year signals the start of winter when sunlight hours fall to an average of just two a day.1 Bupa, the UK&rsquo;s leading healthcare company is urging people to take Vitamin D to reduce their risk of cancer as day-time no longer means sun-time.</p><p>Vitamin D helps protect against certain cancers such as breast, bowel, prostate and colon. For people to obtain enough Vitamin D naturally, they need either to expose their skin to lots of summer sun or eat large quantities of oily fish. Bupa&rsquo;s assistant medical director, Dr Virginia Warren said: &ldquo;Natural ways to get enough vitamin D aren&rsquo;t realistic because our skin cannot make vitamin D from winter sunlight in the UK as it is too weak. In the summer, people are rightly concerned about risks of skin cancer. And nobody wants to eat four tins of mackerel every day to get their vitamin D from oily fish.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, after analysing years of independent research,2 Bupa says the only alternative is to take Vitamin D supplements to reduce the chance of developing cancer by 26 percent.3 People need to take at least 1,500 - 2000 international units (IU) a day, which equates to 3-4 high strength capsules (12.5 micrograms/capsule).</p><p>Dr Warren continues: &ldquo;People have to act now to take preventative measures against cancer for their future long-term health. The old-fashioned view was to take a low daily dose of Vitamin D for healthy bones. Cancer is today&rsquo;s biggest killer and we need to protect our bodies from it as much as we can. Taking Vitamin D supplements are an effective, inexpensive and easy way of doing that.&rdquo;</p><p>-ends-</p><p>For more information please contact: Michelle Gibb, Bupa Corporate Affairs, Tel: +44 (0) 20 7656 2667, <a href=mailto:michelle.gibb@bupa.com>michelle.gibb@bupa.com</a></p><h3 id=about-bupa>About Bupa</h3><p>Bupa is a leading international healthcare company.
