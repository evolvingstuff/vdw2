Lung cancer has an unfavorable prognosis with a rate of low overall survival, caused by the difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages and resistance to therapy. In recent years, there have been new therapies that use specific molecular targets and are effective in increasing the survival chances of advanced cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to find more specific biomarkers that can identify early changes in carcinogenesis and allow the earliest possible treatment. Vitamin D (VD) plays an important role in immunity and carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulates the expression of various genes involved in the physiological functions of the hu­man organism. The genes encoding the VDR are extremely polymorphic and vary greatly between human populations. 

To date, there are significant associations between VDR polymorphism and several types of cancer, but the data on the involvement of VDR polymorphism in lung cancer are still conflicting. Therefore, in this review, our aim was to investigate the relationship between VDR single-nucleotide polymorphisms in humans and the degree of risk for developing lung cancer. The studies showcased different gene polymorphisms to be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer; TaqI, ApaI, BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2. In addition, there is a strong positive correlation between VD deficiency and lung cancer development. Still, due to a lack of awareness, the assessment of VD status and VDR polymorphism is rarely considered for the prediction of lung cancer evolution and their clinical applicability, despite the fact that studies have shown the highest risk for lung cancer given by TaqI gene polymorphisms and that VDR polymorphisms are associated with more aggres­sive cancer evolution.

##### Has Lung Cancer, like many other cancers,COVID, etc. learned how to protect itself from Vitamin D by altering the VDR?

#### Cost of CT scans and Vitamin D for a 20% reduction in lung cancer deaths

* CT: early detection: Cost $800/year

* Vitamin D prevention: [Cost $ 5/year](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

> Note: no proof for Vitamin D and lung cancer as of May 2014, but [proof for many other cancers and diseases](/posts/proof-that-vitamin-d-works)

> [Cancer patients 64% less likely to die if have a high level of vitamin D – Dec 2011](/tags/cancer-patients-64-less-likely-to-die-if-have-a-high-level-of-vitamin-d-dec-2011.html)

> Vitamin D would also prevent many other forms of Cancer and health problems

##### Estimation of the cost of CT scan per pack

* Assume same number years of smoking at CT scanning

* Assume 400 packs per year  (> the minimum of 32/year)

* Cost of scan to the public per pack = $2

#### Lung Cancer factoids from The Body by Bill Bryson, 2019

* 80 percent of all men smoked  by the late 1940s—but very few of them developed lung cancer.

* The upshot was that by the late 1950s the average smoker was taking in more tar and nicotine than he had before filters were invented.

*  **American Medical Association took 15 years to endorse the surgeon general’s finding.** 

   * - can anticipate getting change from AMA  about Vitamin D will take decades - Comment by founder of VitaminDWiki

* As late as 1973, Nature ran an editorial backing women’s smoking during pregnancy on the grounds that it calmed their stress.

* Nearly one-third of people below the poverty line (in the US) still smoke, and the habit continues to account for one-fifth of all deaths.

#### Why is the number of lung cancers in people who have never smoked increasing?

* [Jan 26, 2021](https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/26/growing-share-of-lung-cancer-turning-up-in-never-smokers/?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits)

   * " “If lung cancer in never-smokers were a separate entity, it would be in the top 10 cancers in the U.S.” for both incidence and mortality."

   * "A 2019 study in South Korea diagnosed lung cancer in 0.45% of never-smokers, compared to 0.86% of smokers. "

      * but the US never screens for lung cancer in never-smokers

 **Perhaps many cancers are increasing: toxins, poor food, less vitamin D, radon, family history of lung cancer . . .**
