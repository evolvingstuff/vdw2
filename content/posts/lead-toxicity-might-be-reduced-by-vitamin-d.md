**Vitamin D might both prevent and treat lead toxicity**

#### Happened to read in Bill Bryson's excellent 2010 book: At Home

 **On pg 315:"Although lead has been removed from most consumer products, it continues to build up in the atmosphere because of industrial applications  The average person today have about <span style="color:#F06;">625 </span> times more lead in his system than someone of fifty years ago"** 

In early 2010 I had noticed that many diseases have seemed to increase during the past 40 years, and that the link appeared to be staying away from the sun and thus having lower vitamin D.

1. Large increase in past 50 years - of lead,   (Is the increase in lead real?)

1. Large increase in past 40 years - of many diseases

1. Are they associated?

#### Hunted around the internet found lots of information on:

* lead poisoning

* lead toxicity

* lead with children (growing bones easily take up lead, especially when Calcium is not very available

* [WHO in 2002](http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862002000100022) said that no amount of lead is tolerable ( had been 40, then 20, then 10, now 0)

* decrease in lead in the (US) environment due to taking lead out of gasoline

* lack of vitamin D allows more lead to get into bones (lack of Calcium)

#### 70% of all US lead emissions now come from propeller aircraft (small airport hot-spots?) - 2023

 **[reference](https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/environment/2022/10/19/lead-emissions-from-small-planes-may-be-a-health-hazard)** 

Elsewhere: 

* U.S. regulators banned the use of leaded gasoline in passenger cars in 1996, but aircraft were exempt because there was no "operationally safe, suitable replacement," per the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

* America’s fleet of 170,000 piston-engine aircraft burns about 186 million gallons of leaded fuel. That releases about  **468 tons**  of lead into the atmosphere, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates.
