**Both Vitamin D and Omega-3 extend life  
Unsure which extends life more  
Probably they aid each other &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspect 1+1 = 2.5   
Unaware of any studies which compare them** 

 **Vertical axis = Health  
Horizonal axis = Lifespan   
Healthspan increases both**

#### 34% lower risk for death from any cause if high Omega-3 – 2018

 **Erythrocyte long-chain omega-3 fatty acid levels are inversely associated with mortality and with incident cardiovascular disease: The Framingham Heart Study** 

Journal of Clinical LipidoLogy (2018)

BACKGROUND: The extent to which omega-3 fatty acid status is related to risk for death from any cause and for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains controversial.

OBJECTIVE: To examine these associations in the Framingham Heart Study.

DESIGN: Prospective and observational.

SETTING: Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.

MEASUREMENTS: The exposure marker was red blood cell levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosa- hexaenoic acids (the Omega-3 Index) measured at baseline. Outcomes included mortality (total, CVD, cancer, and other) and total CVD events in participants free of CVD at baseline. Follow-up was for a median of 7.3 years. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for 18 variables (demographic, clinical status, therapeutic, and CVD risk factors).

RESULTS: Among the 2500 participants (mean age 66 years, 54% women), there were 350 deaths (58 from CVD, 146 from cancer, 128 from other known causes, and 18 from unknown causes). There were 245 CVD events. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, a higher Omega-3 Index was associated with significantly lower risks (P-values for trends across quintiles) for total mortality (P = .02), for non- CVD and non-cancer mortality (P = .009), and for total CVD events (P = .008). Those in the highest (>6.8%) compared to those in the lowest Omega-3 Index quintiles (<4.2%) had a 34% lower risk for death from any cause and 39% lower risk for incident CVD. These associations were generally stronger for docosahexaenoic acid than for eicosapentaenoic acid. When total cholesterol was compared with the Omega-3 Index in the same models, the latter was significantly related with these outcomes, but the former was not.

LIMITATIONS: Relatively short follow-up time and one-time exposure assessment.

CONCLUSIONS: A higher Omega-3 Index was associated with reduced risk of both CVD and allcause mortality.
