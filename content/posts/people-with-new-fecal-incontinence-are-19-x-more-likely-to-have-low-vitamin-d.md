Background: Vitamin-D is essential for musculoskeletal health. We aimed to determine whether patients with fecal incontinence (FI): (1) are more likely to have vitamin-D deficiency and, (2) have higher rates of comorbid medical conditions.

Methods: We examined 18- to 90-year-old subjects who had 25-hydroxy vitamin-D levels, and no vitamin-D supplementation within 3 months of testing, in a large, single-institutional electronic health records dataset, between 2017 and 2022. Cox proportional hazards survival analysis was used to assess association of vitamin-D deficiency on FI.

Key results: Of 100,111 unique individuals tested for serum 25-hydroxy vitamin-D, 1205 (1.2%) had an established diagnosis of FI. Most patients with FI were female (75.9% vs. 68.7%, p = 0.0255), Caucasian (66.3% vs. 52%, p = 0.0001), and older (64.2 vs. 53.8, p < 0.0001). 

* Smoking (6.56% vs. 2.64%, p = 0.0001) and 

* GI comorbidities, including 

   * constipation (44.9% vs. 9.17%, p = 0.0001), 

   * irritable bowel syndrome (20.91% vs. 3.72%, p = 0.0001), and 

   * diarrhea (28.55% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.0001) 

were more common among FI patients. 

Charlson Comorbidity Index score was significantly higher in patients with FI (5.5 vs. 2.7, p < 0.0001). Significantly higher proportions of patients with FI had vitamin-D deficiency (7.14% vs. 4.45%, p < 0.0001). Moreover, after propensity-score matching, rate of  **new FI diagnosis was higher in patients with vitamin-D deficiency; HR 1.9**  (95% CI <span>[1.14-3.15]</span>), p = 0.0131.

Conclusion & inferences: Patients with FI had higher rates of vitamin-D deficiency along with increased overall morbidity. Future research is needed to determine whether increased rate of FI in patients with vitamin-D deficiency is related to frailty associated with increased medical morbidities.
