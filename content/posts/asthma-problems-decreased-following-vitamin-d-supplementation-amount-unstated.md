Background: We evaluated if vitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency may influence the severity of asthma.

Methods: We assessed 25-OHD during the winter 2012-2013 in 121 asthmatic patients attending our clinic since one year at least, and related vitamin levels to airway obstruction, dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and  **asthma exacerbations (AE)**  in the last year (derived from medical records). The effect of one year vitamin D supplementation on lung function and AE was also assessed.

Results: The 121 patients were 95 women and 26 men, mean age 52 +/- 16 yrs, 15 current smokers (12.4%).GINA class distribution: class 1=9% - 2=31% - 3=34% - 4=26%. 25-OHD was deficient in all the patients but 13, severely (<10 ng/ml) in 27 (22%), lowest in patients with >= 2 AE. 25-OHD levels were significantly related directly to FEV1% predicted (r=0.24, p=0.009), and inversely to GINA class (r=0.28, p=0.002) and ICS dose (r=0.20, p=0.023). The adjusted odds ratio of having frequent AE if having severe 25-OHD deficiency, was 4.38(CI 1.1-17.5).

The effect of vitamin D supplementation was assessed in 56 patients showing satisfactory compliance with treatment. These patients had more severe asthma and higher number of AE.

 **Vitamin D supplementation for one year was associated with decreased AE number (p=0.0001) and improved airway obstruction (p<0.0001).** 

Conclusion: Severe 25-OHD deficiency was common in our asthmatic patients and was related to airway obstruction, higher ICS dose and higher AE rate. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased rate of AE and improvement of airway obstruction.
