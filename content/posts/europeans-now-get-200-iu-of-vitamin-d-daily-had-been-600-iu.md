#### Contribution of different vitamin D forms and fortified foods to vitamin D intake in Europe: a narrative review

J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2025 Apr 14:106761. [doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2025.106761](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2025.106761)

In the current narrative review, the bioavailability of the main vitamin D forms is evaluated. The mean intakes and main contributing forms of vitamin D in the European diet are estimated, as well as the major contributing dietary sources. The literature is reviewed for studies reporting on the proportion of users and non-users of fortified food with vitamin D intakes below reference intakes. In addition, the availability of vitamin D-fortified prepackaged retail products and fortification levels in the European market is assessed. Previously, vitamins D2 and D3 forms were considered the primary forms in the diet. Recent analytical methods suggest that dietary 25(OH)D3, when adjusted for higher bioequivalence, significantly contributes to total vitamin D intakes. When also considering 25(OH)D3 from foods, the estimated vitamin D intake from an average European diet was 3.8µg/d of total Vitamin D Equivalents: vitamin D3, vitamin D2 and 25(OH)D3, contributing about 71%, 2%, and 27%, respectively. Animal foods, fortified fats and spreads contributed most to total intakes. 

Literature suggests that  **94-100% of Europeans aged ≥ 13y fail to meet the vitamin D reference intake of 10µg/d,** 

* About 98-100% of vitamin D-fortified food users and

* 99-100% of non-users in the UK and Netherlands consumed less than 10µg/d of vitamin D. 

About 1.2% of prepackaged foods and drinks were voluntary fortified with vitamin D, margarine and plant-based drinks providing most of the daily vitamin D. Encouraging fortification and other strategies may support closing the gap between current and recommended vitamin D intakes.

#### European diet 150 years ago provided 600-1000 IU of Vitamin D daily

Pre-processed form provides  <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-from-animal-increases-6x-when-consider-that-already-processed-by-animal-livers" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Vitamin D from animal increases 6X when consider that already processed by animal livers">6X equivalent Vitamin D than non-preprocessed vitamin D</a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; pork, lard, chicken, eggs, eels, liver, kidneys, herring, mackerel, sardines,  etc.

{MOUSEOVER(label="Hover here to see question" offsetx="4" offsety="15")} I would like to get an estimate about how much vitamin D the average European got from food daily 150 years ago. Food used to contain a LOT more vitamin D. Examples: pigs, chicken, eels, liver, kidneys, small fatty fish, sardines, tripe, eggs. Note: many animal products contain a lot more semi-activated vitamin D, than regular vitamin D{MOUSEOVER}

Example: A slice of pie made with lard from pigs raised outdoor contained 2,000 IU

see: (("Free range" lard has 500 IU vitamin D per teaspoon))

!!!!Industrial food production removed about 400 IU, ((Fortification with Vitamin D">Fortification</a> replaces about 120 IU
