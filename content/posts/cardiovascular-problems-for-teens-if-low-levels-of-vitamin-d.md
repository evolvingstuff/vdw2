# Circulating 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations Are Correlated With Cardiometabolic Risk Among American Black and White Adolescents Living in a Year-Round Sunny Climate.

OBJECTIVE: Low vitamin D status is common among healthy black and white adolescents residing at southern U.S. latitudes with a year-round sunny climate. 

Thus we aimed to study the relationships between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and cardiometabolic risk factors in this population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 25(OH)D concentrations were measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy in 701 girls and boys (14-18 years old, 54% blacks, 49% females). Cardiometabolic risk was indexed by adipokines, inflammatory markers, fasting glucose, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, and blood pressures (BP).

RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, race, sexual maturation, season, physical activity, and percent body fat, 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.06, P = 0.05), leptin (r = -0.32, P < 0.01), fibrinogen (r = -0.05, P = 0.03), glucose (r = -0.16, P = 0.02), HOMA-IR (r = -0.17, P < 0.01), HDL cholesterol (r = 0.14, P = 0.02), systolic BP (r = -0.10, P = 0.02), and diastolic BP (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). 

When 25(OH)D concentrations were stratified into increasing tertiles, there were significant linear upward trends for 

* adiponectin (P = 0.01) and *

HDL cholesterol (P = 0.04), 

but significant linear down trends for 

* glucose (P < 0.01), 

* HOMA-IR (P < 0.01), and 

* systolic BP (P < 0.01), 

after adjusting for the above covariates.

CONCLUSIONS: Circulating 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with various adverse cardiometabolic risk factors, independent of adiposity. 

Clinical trials addressing the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiometabolic risk are warranted in adolescents irrespective of their geographical regions.
