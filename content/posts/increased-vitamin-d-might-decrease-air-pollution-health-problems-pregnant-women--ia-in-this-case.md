#### Modulatory Effects of Vitamin D: A Possible Approach to Mitigate Air Pollution Related Pregnancy Complications

Journal of Reproduction & Infertility Volume (25) issue (2) [PDF is behind a paywall](https://doi.org/10.18502/jri.v25i2.16004)

 **Approximately 99% of people on the planet breathe air that exceeds the World Health Organizationâ€™s permitted threshold for pollution.** 

South Asia is home to the world's most polluted cities. 

Population-based studies have suggested that women's reproductive health outcomes are worsening due to air pollution.

* Preeclampsia, 

* miscarriage, 

* gestational diabetes, 

* high blood pressure, and 

unfavorable birth outcomes, including 

* preterm birth, 

* low birth weight, or even 

* stillbirth 

are all linked to exposure to air pollution during pregnancy.

 **It is estimated that 0.61 million deaths in India alone were related to indoor air pollution.** 

Females frequently cook in the household using solid fuel as a primary combustion source. Women in the regions with the highest population density are disproportionately affected by high levels of poor-quality indoor air. Recently, it has been proposed that air pollution has a distinct role in the onset of vitamin D deficiency. Numerous studies have explored associations between low vitamin D level and various female reproductive health conditions since the discovery of the vitamin D receptor. It is worthy to note that some of these reproductive health conditions positively correlate with the severity of air pollution. In this study, the evidence has been synthesized on vitamin D's protective properties and dietary and pharmaceutical interventions have been discussed to show their beneficial effects in decreasing the long-term negative impacts of air pollution on women's health.
