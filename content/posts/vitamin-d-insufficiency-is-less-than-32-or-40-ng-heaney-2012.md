# What Is Vitamin D Insufficiency? And Does It Matter?

The term nutrient "insufficiency," as commonly used, refers to a nutritional status intermediate between classical, severe deficiency, and full normal. As both "deficiency" and "insufficiency" are causes of dysfunction and disease, there is no biological basis for a distinction between them. 

What is important to note is that, in the case of vitamin D, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that there is real, preventable disease in the range of vitamin D status values now labeled "insufficient."

## From the conclusion

Additionally, it must be noted in closing that 

* (1) there is no consensus with regard to the vitamin D status that represents true adequacy and 

* (2) there is a substantial and growing body of evidence indicating that the lower end of

> the adequate range is at least as high as  **32**  ng/mL (80 nmol/L) and, by some criteria,  **40**  ng/mL (100 nmol/L).

The fact that this value is higher than that recently recommended by the IOM may be due in large part to their use of a drug-based approach to evaluating efficacy, rather than one based on physiological criteria.
