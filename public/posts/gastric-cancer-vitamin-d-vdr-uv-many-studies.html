This meta-analysis aimed to examine the association of 5 common polymorphisms in VDR, including Taq1 rs731236 (T > C), FokI rs2228570 (C > T), Cdx2 rs11568820 (G > A), BsmI rs1544410 (G > A), and ApaI rs7975232 (G > T) with the risk of GC.</p><p>Methods: A comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify relevant studies published until January 2024. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to assess the magnitude of associations.</p><p>Results: Nine studies, with 2837 participants (1215 GC cases and 1622 healthy controls), were eligible. The FokI rs2228570 polymorphism showed a significant correlation with heightened susceptibility to GC under the recessive model ( <strong>OR = 1.52</strong> ; 95% CI: 1.06-2.19) and homozygote comparison (TT vs CC; OR = <strong>1.59</strong> ; 95% CI: 1.09-2.31). Taq1 rs731236 was also linked to an elevated risk of GC under the same models (recessive OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.14-2.39; homozygote OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.11-2.54). In the sensitivity analysis, when studies not adhering to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were excluded, the relationship between FokI rs2228570 polymorphism and GC disappeared, while the association for Taq1 rs731236 remained consistent. No significant association was identified for BsmI rs1544410, ApaI rs7975232, and Cdx2 rs11568820.</p><p>Conclusion: This study revealed that FokI rs2228570 and Taq1 rs731236 polymorphisms of VDR might be linked to the odds of GC.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/gc-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=observation-vdr-down-and-up-regulation-sunlightuvb-is-good>Observation: VDR down and up-regulation, Sunlight/UVB is good</h4><ul><li><p>Various cancers. most viruses, and <a href=https://VitaminDWiki.com/Vitamin+D+Receptor#health_problems_associated_with_poor_VDR>50+ health problems</a> are able to protect themselves from Vitamin D by down-regulating the Vitamin D Receptor, which reduces Vitamin D getting into the cells</p></li><li><p>Some of the time the person already had a poor Vitamin D Receptor (a poor VDR can <a href=/posts/health-problems-running-in-family-may-be-due-to-poor-vitamin-d-hypertension-vdr-in-this-case>run in the family</a> ).</p></li><li><p>Sunlight appears to fight many health problems, sometimes better than the Vitamin D made by UVB</p><ul><li>VitaminDWiki has long believed <a href=/posts/sun-is-better-than-uv-which-is-better-than-vitamin-d>Sun is better than UV, which is better than Vitamin D</a></li></ul></li><li><p>You can <a href=https://VitaminDWiki.com/Vitamin+D+Receptor#How_to_increase_VDR_activation>up-regulate the VDR in 14 different</a></p></li><li><p>You can also bypass a poor VDR by using <a href=/posts/better-than-daily>infrequent Vitamin D instead of daily D</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=15-increased-rate-of-gastrointestinal-cancers-in-those-under-age-50-during-9-years---aug-2023>15% increased rate of Gastrointestinal Cancers in those under age 50 during 9 years - Aug 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/264806/breast-cancer/cancer-rates-rise-among-people-under-age-50?ecd=WNL_EVE_230818_mdedge%20">Cancer rates rise among people under age 50 - MD Edge</a></strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/cancer-incidence-uner-50.jpg alt=image width=600>

The UK Biobank cohort was used for this nested caseâ€“control study (N = 3732). Primary, incident esophageal and gastric cancer cases diagnosed after recruitment were identified via linkage to National Cancer Registries. Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring Internet Service database was used to calculate ambient annual UVB dose (D-UVB). Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between annual ambient D-UVB and risk of esophageal and gastric cancer, and odds ratios (ORs) are reported. In total, 373 esophageal and 249 gastric cancer cases and 3110 age- and gender-matched controls were included in the study. We found a strong inverse association between annual ambient D-UVB and odds of developing esophageal or <strong>gastric cancer</strong> : Compared to the lowest tertile, OR for the highest tertile was <strong>0.64</strong> (95%CI:0.51â€“0.79) in adjusted analysis.</p><p>The association was strengthened when restricted to <strong>esophageal cancer (OR = 0.60</strong> ; 95%CI:0.45â€“0.80) and</p><p><strong>esophageal adenocarcinoma cases (OR = 0.48</strong> ; 95%CI: 0.34â€“0.68).

Among men, the pooled effect size or highest versus lowest category of serum Vitamin D levels was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.18, P = 0.49). The corresponding figures in women were 1.04 and 95% CI: 0.74-1.47 (P = 0.80).</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>We found no evidence for the significant association between Vitamin D status and risk of GC.

Despite the recent advancements in GC research, it is most often diagnosed during the terminal stages and with limited treatment modalities contributing to its poor prognosis and a lower survival rate.</p><p>Much research has provided conflicting results between a vitamin D deficient status and the development of GC. Vitamin D is a well-known and essential hormone classically known to regulate calcium and phosphate absorption, enabling adequate mineralization of the skeletal system. However, the function of vitamin D is multidimensional. It possesses unique roles, including acting as antioxidants or immunomodulators while crossing the cell membrane, performing several intracellular functions, participating in gene regulation, and controlling the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, including those of GC.</p><p>In light of this, it is imperative to analyze the causes of GC, review the factors that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of treatments, and discover the tools to determine prognosis, reduce mortality, and prevent GC development. In this review, we have summarized recent investigations on multiple associations between vitamin D and GC, emphasizing genetic associations, vitamin D receptors, and the prevalence of hormone deficiency in those developing this aggressive malignancy.</p><h5 id=conclusions---from-pdf-vdr>Conclusions - from pdf (VDR)</h5><p>Several studies have been conducted to explore the relationship between vitamin D and GC. We observed a variety of correlations between vitamin D and GC. In most studies, GC patients have shown an increased prevalence of VDD, although few studies on VDD prevalence in GC patients are paradoxical. UVB radiation has been shown in most ecological studies to lessen the incidence and mortality of GC. An adequate vitamin D level has been associated with an increase in the survival rate of GC patients, and a low vitamin D level can be considered as a poor prognostic factor in GC.</p><p>Furthermore, variations in the VDR gene have been attributed to an increased risk of various malignancies, including GC. Many VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with the risk of GC. However, various research on VDR gene polymorphisms and GC risk have yielded inconsistent results.</p><p>Vitamin D exerts an anti-cancer effect by different mechanisms, such as regulating epigenetic pathways, upregulating the expression of miRNAs, boosting the action of cisplatin, stimulating TSGs, and regulating intracellular signal transduction. We also found that serum vitamin D is lower in the HP-positive patients than negative ones, and vitamin D deficient patients fail to eliminate HP. Based on the facts presented above, we may conclude that vitamin D is a protective factor in GC. It can be utilized as a promising technique to treat GC and increase survival rates by correcting the deficiency of vitamin D. However, additional studies are required to fully assess the genetic association of VDR in GC for a more profound knowledge of how to diagnose and treat the aggressive malignancy early and effectively to maximize the survival outcomes.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/gastric-cancer-and-vitamin-d-genes.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=gastric-cancer-may-need-gut-friendly-vitamin-dpostsgut-friendly-vitamin-d>Gastric Cancer may need <a href=/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d>Gut-Friendly Vitamin D</a></h4></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
