#### [Asthma Prevalence Three Times Higher in MS](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910031?src=rsshttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910031?src=rss) Medscape

 **Presented at Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2019** 

Used the electronic health record information available in the IBM Explorys EPM: Explore database

141,880 people with MS – 19% had asthma

56,416,790 without MS – 6.6 % had asthma

2.97- <span>[CI]</span>, 2.96, 2.97, P < .0001).

“"It is unknown why there is this increase," Briggs explained. "We do know that MS and asthma share several common risk factors, including tobacco smoke,  **vitamin D insufficiency** , and obesity. There is also evidence for some overlap in their genetic risk factors."
