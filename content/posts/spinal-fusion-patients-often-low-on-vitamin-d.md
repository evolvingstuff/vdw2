### [Lower levels of vitamin D may put spinal fusion patients at risk, study finds](http://www.jsonline.com/features/health/lower-levels-of-vitamin-d-may-put-spinal-fusion-patients-at-risk-study-finds-133155178.html)

57% inadequate (< 30 ng)

27% deficient (20 ng)

4% severe deficient (< 10 ng)

The paper, presented Thursday at the North American Spine Society annual meeting,

Buchowski said the idea of checking vitamin D levels of patients first occurred to him in 2008. 

A woman in her 40s who had undergone cervical fusion surgery and did not get an adequate fusion told him that she had been treated for a vitamin D deficiency.

"It was like a light bulb went off," he said.

For the last year and a half, all patients undergoing fusion surgery at Washington University have their vitamin D levels checked.

If they are deficient, they will be supplemented with a 50,000 IU  **<span style="color:#F00;">prescription dose</span>**  once a week for eight weeks before their surgery, he said.
