Vitamin D deficiency is a potentially modifiable risk factor that may be targeted for breast cancer prevention and treatment. Preclinical studies support various antitumor effects of vitamin D in breast cancer. Numerous observational studies have reported an inverse association between vitamin D status, including circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, and breast cancer risk. 

The relationship between vitamin D and  **mammographic density** , a strong predictor of breast cancer risk, remains unclear. 

Studies analyzing the link between  **genetic polymorphisms**  in vitamin D pathway genes and breast cancer incidence and prognosis have yielded inconsistent results. 

Vitamin D  **deficiency**  among breast cancer patients has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes and increased mortality. 

Despite a number of clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, the efficacy, optimal dosage of vitamin D, and target blood level of 25(OH)D for breast cancer prevention have yet to be determined. 

Even with substantial literature on vitamin D and breast cancer, future studies need to focus on gaining a better understanding of the biologic effects of vitamin D in breast tissue. 

Despite compelling data from experimental and observational studies, there is still insufficient data from clinical trials to make recommendations for vitamin D supplementation for breast cancer prevention or treatment.
