#### The Distinct Regulation of the Vitamin D and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptors in COVID-19

Nutrients 2024 Feb 22;16(5):598. [doi: 10.3390/nu16050598.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16050598.)

Background: SARS-CoV-2 affects several immune pathways, including the vitamin D (VDR) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathways (AhR). The aim of the study was the evaluation of the VDR and AhR pathways in the blood of COVID-19 patients with regard to the severity of disease. 

Methods: Observational, single-center, case-control design. A total of 240 samples were selected for exploration. Patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but suffered from other respiratory infections (ORIs) served as a control group. 

Results: VDR-specific mRNA in the blood of patients with mild symptoms (131.2 ± 198.6) was significantly upregulated relative to the VDR expression of the ORI group (23.24 ± 42.60; p < 0.0001); however, VDR expression of critically ill patients showed an impaired upregulation (54.73 ± 68.34; p < 0.001). CYP27B1 expression was not significantly regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was a downregulation of VDR and CYP27B1 compared to survivors. There was no significant difference in 25(OH)-vitamin D3 levels between critically ill patients with regard to survival (24.3 ± 9.4 vs. 27.1 ± 11.3; p = 0.433). 

Conclusion: The VDR and AhR pathways are distinctively regulated in patients suffering from COVID-19 depending on the severity of disease. A combination treatment of antiviral drugs and vitamin D substitution should be evaluated for potentially improved prognosis in COVID-19.
