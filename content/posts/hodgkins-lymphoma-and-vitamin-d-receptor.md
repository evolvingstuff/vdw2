Background

Hodkin’s lymphoma is one of the most frequent lymphoma in western world. Despite an overall good prognosis some patients suffer relapsing tumors which are difficult to cure. Over a long period Vitamin D has been shown to be a potential treatment for cancer. Vitamin D acts via the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor, acting as an inducible transcription factor. We aimed to investigate the expression of vitamin D receptor as potential therapeutic target structure in Hodgkin’s lymphoma as well as in non Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Methods

We used a panel of 193 formalin fixed tissues of lymphoma cases consisting of 55 cases of Hodgkin s lymphoma and 138 cases on several non Hodgkin’s lymphoma entities.

Results

Vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in Hodgkin s lymphoma, regardless of the subentity with an overall positivity of 80% of all Hodgkin lymphoma cases. 

In contrast, only about 17% of the analyzed non Hodgkin’s lymphoma of B-cell origin showed positivity for vitamin D receptor. 

Predominant nuclear localization of vitamin D receptor in Hodgkin’s lymphoma suggests activated status of the vitamin D receptor.

Conclusions

From this study, we conclude that vitamin D receptor plays a potentially important role in pathogenesis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma but not in non Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Further investigations of mutational status and functional studies may shed some light in functional relevance of vitamin D receptor signaling in Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
