#### No A or B  Antigens in type O blood

Type A: blood containing A antigens

Type B: blood containing B antigens

Type AB: blood containing A and B antigens

Type O: blood containing neither A nor B antigens

* "What are antigens in blood? Blood group antigens are carbohydrates that are attached to proteins or lipids. An antigen is a substance foreign to the body that causes an immune response. An immune response occurs when antibodies, which are proteins in your immune system, are summoned to attack an antigen."

 **Interesting to note**  

* "If you contract an infection, antibodies called memory B cells quickly reproduce and make the specific antibodies you need to destroy that antigen." 

* Epstein-Barr Virus (in virtually all adults) hides in memory B cells

* Perhaps the extra memory B cells produced to fight COVID increase the prevalence of EVB
