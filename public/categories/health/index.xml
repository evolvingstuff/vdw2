&lt;p>The incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) varies with latitude. Ebers has co-ordinated a study &lt;sup>[46]&lt;/sup> that examined more than 40,000 Canadian, British, Danish and Swedish patients with multiple sclerosis. The results show that in the Northern hemisphere, significantly fewer (8.5%) people with MS were born in November and significantly more (9.1%) were born in May. In the Southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed and November is the peak month and May the lowest. There are several clues as to the cause. An important study &lt;sup>[47]&lt;/sup> compared the risk of two or more siblings having multiple sclerosis to the risk of its occurrence in both twins in a non-identical pair. There should be no difference, but non-identical twins do have a significantly higher risk of both having MS than non-twin siblings. This suggests that the pre-natal and post-natal environment affects the overall risk. Pinpointing the actual environmental factor has been problematic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NLM Vitamin D recommendations and interactions</title><link>/posts/nlm-vitamin-d-recommendations-and-interactions.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/nlm-vitamin-d-recommendations-and-interactions.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Evaluating the vitamin D evidence - Heaney</title><link>/posts/evaluating-the-vitamin-d-evidence-heaney.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/evaluating-the-vitamin-d-evidence-heaney.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="a-few-images-from-a-presentation-given-in-london">A few images from a Presentation given in London&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In the Western world, the majority of morbidity and mortality are caused by multifactorial diseases. Some risk factors are related to more than one type of disease. These so-called universal risk factors are highly relevant to the population, as reduction of universal risk factors may reduce the prevalence of several types of multifactorial disease simultaneously. Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally seen as an etiological factor in bone disorders such as rickets and osteomalacia.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
