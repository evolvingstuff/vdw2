BACKGROUND:

The significance of vitamin D deficiency in the incidence of bone fractures in children has been under investigated. Here, we aimed to associate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and fractures in Saudi children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This cross-sectional study was conducted in 1022 Saudi children without fracture history <span>[476 boys (age 14.56 ± 1.81, BMI 22.38 ± 5.81) and 546 girls (age 13.57 ± 1.67, BMI 22.24 ± 4.94)]</span> and 234 Saudi children with a history of fracture <span>[148 boys (age 14.25 ± 1.39, BMI 22.66 ± 6.08) and 86 girls (age 13.76 ± 1.35, BMI 21.33 ± 1.35)]</span>. Anthropometric and fasting serum biochemical data were collected. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was assessed using electrochemiluminescence.

RESULTS:

Mean circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin (25OH) D level in subjects with a history of fracture was  **significantly lower in both boys (p < 0.01) and girls (p < 0.01) than those without** , however both groups had low mean 25(OH)D levels. Furthermore, age was positively associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D in boys (p < 0.05) and negatively in girls (p < 0.05) with a history of fracture.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, vitamin D levels were significantly lower in children with a history of bone fractures in both boys and girls than those without such a history; even in the absence of fracture history, vitamin D status correction is warranted in the general Saudi pediatric population
