Unfavorable metabolic profiles and oxidative stress in pregnancy are associated with several complications. This study was conducted to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), metabolic profiles, and biomarkers of oxidative stress in healthy pregnant women. 

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 48 pregnant women aged 18-40 y old at 25 wk of gestation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either  **400 IU/d**  cholecalciferol supplements (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) for 9 wk. Fasting blood samples were taken at study baseline and after 9 wk of intervention to quantify serum concentrations of hs-CRP, lipid concentrations, insulin, and biomarkers of oxidative stress. After 9 wk of intervention, the increases in 

* serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium concentrations were greater in the vitamin D group (+3.7 μg/L and +0.20 mg/dL, respectively) than in the placebo group (-1.2 μg/L and -0.12 mg/dL, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). 

* Vitamin D supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in serum hs-CRP (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -1.41 vs. +1.50 μg/mL; P-interaction = 0.01) and 

* insulin concentrations (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -1.0 vs. +2.6 μIU/mL; P-interaction = 0.04) and a significant increase in the 

* Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index score (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: +0.02 vs. -0.02; P-interaction = 0.006), 

* plasma total antioxidant capacity (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: +152 vs. -20 mmol/L; P-interaction = 0.002), and 

* total glutathione concentrations (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: +205 vs. -32 μmol/L; P-interaction = 0.02) compared with placebo.

* Intake of vitamin D supplements led to a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -0.65 vs. -0.12 mmol/L; P-interaction = 0.01), 

* systolic blood pressure (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -0.2 vs. +5.5 mm Hg; P-interaction = 0.01), and 

* diastolic blood pressure (vitamin D vs. placebo groups: -0.4 vs. +3.1 mm Hg; P-interaction = 0.01) compared with placebo. 

In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation for 9 wk among pregnant women has beneficial effects on metabolic status.
