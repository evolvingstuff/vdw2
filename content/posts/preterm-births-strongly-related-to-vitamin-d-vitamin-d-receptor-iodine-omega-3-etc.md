 **Highlights** 

* This is a new report relating polymorphisms within VDR gene and prematurity's outcomes.

* Herein we correlate clinical characteristics and spontaneous preterm birth, according to the maternal VDR genotype.

* Detection of direct relationship between VDR recessive genotype and specific clinical aspects in women with SPTB.

Preterm birth (PTB) is featured by less than 37 weeks of gestational age or fewer than 259 days since the first day from the last menstrual period. Complications of PTB are the major cause of neonatal deaths, several factors are linked to PTB increased risk including immunological and genetics. Vitamin D plays an important role in immune response modulation and its action occurs through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which recently has been described as overexpressed in human placenta during the pregnancy. Herein we assessed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) FokI (rs2228570 A > G) and Cdx-2 (rs11568820 T > C), within VDR, using TaqMan fluorogenic probes, and differential susceptibility to SPTB. 

We assessed  **104 pregnant women with SPTB**  and 85 women with normal birth in a Northeastern Brazilian population. Statistically significant differences for both SNPs where found when comparing allele and genotype frequencies in both groups: the T allele for rs2228570 and A allele for rs11568820 were significantly more frequent in SPTB group than in normal birth group (p = 0.000013 and p = 0.00466, respectively).

The rs11568820  **A/A**  genotype was associated to clinical/demographic variables such as: 

* premature birth (p = 0.007), 

* neonate weight (p = 0.039), 

* presence of infection during pregnancy (p = 0.011) and 

* premature birth among multiparous (p = 0.015). 

The rs2228570  **T/T**  genotype associated with

* gestational diabetes mellitus (p = 0.044) and 

* chorioamnionitis during pregnancy (p = 0.043).

In conclusion our findings indicate an association between polymorphisms FokI and Cdx-2 within VDR gene and SPTB, suggesting their involvement in the triggering of these syndromes.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms at Fok I site and the risk of preterm birth for potential intervention of of preterm birth or threatened premature delivery.

METHODS: Fifty-seven women with preterm birth and 84 with full-term birth were included in this analysis. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was performed to identify VDR gene Fok I genotypes.

RESULTS: No significant difference was found in age, D-dimer (DDI), fibrinogen (Fg), serum calcium (Ca2+), leukocyte count or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level between the women in the preterm and full-term birth groups (P>0.05). The two groups differed significantly in the distribution of VDR gene Fok I site genotypes and allele frequency of F/F (P<0.05).The frequency of FF genotype was significantly higher in the preterm group than in the full-term group. Compared with Ff and ff genotypes, FF genotype was associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery (χ2=9.701, P=9.701,  **OR=3.320** , 95% CI <span>[1.560, 7.066]</span>). In the preterm group, the maternal age, DDI, Fg, serum Ca2+, leukocyte count or HbA1c did not differ significantly between the genotypes (P>0.05).

CONCLUSION: VDR gene Fok I site genotypes are related with preterm birth, and the FF genotype may serve as a potential risk factor for preterm birth.

#### Preterm birth 34 X more likely if have worst VDR combination - Dec 2016

OBJECTIVES:

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in the placenta and tissues related to the immune system occurrence of various variants of VDR may modify the effects of vitamin D on pregnancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the parturients' Apa1, Taq1, and Bsm1 polymorphisms of the VDR and their combinations and the risk of preterm birth in the Polish population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:

Determination of polymorphism for VDR was assayed using the RT-PCR method. 199 Caucasian women at childbirth were qualified:100 patients who had a spontaneous preterm birth and 99 patients who had a term birth.

RESULTS:

Three separate genotypes of the Apa1, Taq1, and Bsm1 polymorphisms were detected. No significant differences in the frequency of particular genotypes in the compared groups were found. Some of the genotype combinations were significantly more frequent in the preterm group - the bb/AA/TT genotype (28.0% vs. 10.1%; p = 0.0013) and the BB/aa/tt genotype (14.0% vs. 4.04% p = 0.0277). The Bb/AA/Tt and the BB/Aa/tt genotypes were found only in the control group (16.1% and 7.0% of patients, respectively). The bb/aa/TT was significantly more frequent in the control group (2.0% vs. 11.1%; p = 0,0207). 

Two genotype combinations reduced the risk of preterm birth - the 

* Bb/AA/Tt genotype by 94% (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.002-0.885, p = 0.041) and the 

* BB/Aa/tt genotype by 98% ( **<span style="color:#F00;">OR = 0.029</span>** , 95% CI: 0.001-0.838, p = 0.039).

CONCLUSIONS:

Our result suggests that there may be a relationship between certain VDR genotype combinations and the risk of preterm birth. Further research is needed in order to substantiate this finding.

Objective: Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of high infant mortality and long-term disability in young children worldwide. Array of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes linked with vitamin D level and its associated vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. We undertook this study to investigate the association between VDR gene polymorphism with vitamin D deficiency and PTB in West Indian pregnant women.

Methods: A total of 72 women with PTB and 138 healthy mothers with uncomplicated normal delivery were selected from different regions of Gujarat, India. FokI and TaqI single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of VDR gene determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Vitamin D level was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Result: ff genotype (29.17% vs. 10.87%, p=0.002) and f allele (49.31% vs. 35.51%, p=0.006) frequency distributions of VDR FokI showed significantly ( **odds ratio=0.566** , 95% confidence interval=0.368-0.870, p=0.006) higher in women with preterm delivery than in control full term group. Genotype frequency of VDR TaqI showed no significant difference between preterm group and control.

Conclusion: These results confirmed that women carrying ff genotype of FokI gene had significantly higher risk for vitamin D deficiency which enhances the risk of prematurity than women carrying FF genotype in West Indian women.
