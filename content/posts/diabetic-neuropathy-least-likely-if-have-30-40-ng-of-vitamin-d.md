Wonder how this study found people with diabetic neuropathy with high levels of vitamin D

I do not recall any previous studies showing high vitamin D levels among diabetics

Aims: Vitamin D deficiency has recently been speculated to be associated with increased risk of diabetes neuropathy (DN). The aim of this study was to evaluate the odds of symptomatic DN across serum vitamin D levels.

Methods: All patients with DM were assessed using diabetic neuropathy symptoms and diabetic neuropathy examination score. Overall, 150 cases with DN and 600 controls were included. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) was measured to determine vitamin D status.

Results: A non-linear association between 25-OH-D and suffering from symptomatic DN was observed which was extracted after stratifying the ORs across different serum 25-OH-D levels. When compared to individuals with 25-OH-D of 30-40 ng/mL, patients with deficient (<20 ng/mL) vitamin D levels had higher odds of having symptomatic DN (OR:2.04, 95%CI: 0.99–4.02, P = 0.054). Participants with vitamin D values of greater than 40 ng/mL were also more likely to exhibit symptomatic DN (fully adjusted OR:4.29, 95%CI: 1.59–11.55).

Conclusions: We hypothesize a non-linear contribution of serum vitamin D to symptomatic DN occurrence, which emphasizes that administration of vitamin D should be monitored and evaluated more carefully, especially in patients with diabetes.
