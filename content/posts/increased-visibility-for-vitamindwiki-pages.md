 **Project put on hold becasue I am too busy** 

 **Approximate hours per day** 

* 5 hours - caregiving for 103 year-old father-in-law living with us

> see also [Off topic – Caregiving of seniors at home – helpful hints](/posts/off-topic-caregiving-of-seniors-at-home-helpful-hints)

* 3 hours scanning news items ~`100 new studies each day and uploading ~8 of them and updating 10 others

* 3 hours getting HMO to notice the bottom line benefits of Vitamin D

So, did not have ~3 hours to manage assistants to increase the visibility of VitaminDWiki web pages

I have found assistants for each of 4 categories of work but do not have time to manage them

</div>

 **Some of the 7,000+ VitaminDWiki pages are**  

* Very popular (>3,000 visits)

* And have been read for 3+ minutes (average)

 **We are considering giving these pages more visibility through**   

* [https://www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net) in PDF format

* [http://www.slideshare.net](http://www.slideshare.net) in PDF format

* [http://amazon.com](http://amazon.com) in Kindle format

* Social media such as [https://www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com),  [https://www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com)

> 1 paragraph intro with link to webpage

* Advertising of pages with Google AdWords 

> in many languages – English started in 2014

* Sending PDFs (with introductions)  to groups, such as

> [http://examine.com](http://examine.com),  [http://www.mercola.com](http://www.mercola.com),  [http://www.greenmedinfo.com](http://www.greenmedinfo.com) applicable forums

* Medical publication

* Issue a press release for the page (free for non-profits)

* Human translation of a few pages to a few languages (improving Google Translate)

All of the VitaminDWiki pages can be easily read in 90+ languages (via Google Translate)

Thus the publishing/increased visibility can often be done in various languages

Note: Text in graphics are not translated, so may be of little use in another language

* For very old pages: add categories (i.e. pregnancy, autism.) – with summary

* Broken link checking (about 1% of links off of VitaminDWiki are now broken)

* Sometimes extract some or all of attached PDF to page (text & some graphics) for translation (Use ABBYY PDF Transformer+)

> I may not have had enough time to extract it originally

* Edit for readability, possibly improve title

* Check that formatting still OK after translation

* Spell and grammar checking

* Perhaps add incoming links to the page

> Compare "Links to this page" at the bottom of the page with the outgoing hyperlinks

* Publish (make PDF, Kindle, . . ) - probably making "jacket covers" in each language

> Publish in English initially, then perhaps Spanish, etc.

> Note: Print to PDF at bottom of page is English-only.

People with a variety of talents will be needed to do the above preparation and publication** Would like to also create translatable versions of several graphics **The Text-based version of each graphic need not look the samen or have the same colors, but it should have similar content.

This will make the text available for translation during publication - both online and offline
