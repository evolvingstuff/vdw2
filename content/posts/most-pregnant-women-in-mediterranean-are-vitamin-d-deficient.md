Introduction: Despite high levels of sunshine, maternal hypovitaminosis D during pregnancy is prevalent in the Mediterranean region, consisting a paradox. The aim of the study was to systematically review trials that investigated vitamin D concentrations during pregnancy in this region, in order to determine predictors of hypovitaminosis D and explain the paradox.

Methods: After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 15 studies were entered into the systematic review, involving 2649 pregnant women and 1820 neonates. The main outcome was maternal vitamin D concentration. Possible predictors of the outcome included study, maternal and neonatal characteristics (

* age, 

* BMI, 

* race, 

* socioeconomic status, 

* skin type, 

* gestational age, 

* sun exposure, 

* calcium and vitamin D intake and supplementation, 

* smoking status, 

* parity, 

* season of delivery, 

* pregnancy complications).

Results: Studies differed widely in vitamin D deficiency criteria, methods of measurement and outcomes. 

However, prevalence of maternal and neonatal hypovitaminosis D was up to  **<span style="color:#F00;">90%</span>.**  

 **Predictors**  of maternal hypovitaminosis D were 

*  **dark skin phototype** 

*  **race**  and 

*  **sartorial habits** 

Only a few pregnant women met the recommended dietary daily intake of calcium and vitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation was not a common practice.

Conclusions: Hypovitaminosis D during pregnancy is prevalent in the Mediterranean region. Racial, social and cultural habits, as well as the absence of preventive strategies seem to negate the benefits of sun exposure.
