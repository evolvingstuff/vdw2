US FDA recommends  **daily value**  of 800 IU <span style="color:#F00;">per 2,000 IU of calories</span>

 **DV**  of Vitamin D = 20 micrograms = 800 IU will be on US food labels in 2020

 **It is the <span style="color:#F00;">MINIMUM</span> amount to maintain health**

The amount recommended is proportional to the actual calories consumed

Daily value replaced Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA)

Daily value increases with the number of calories consumed.

The RDA was not proportional to calories consumed
