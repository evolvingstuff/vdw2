#### Single 150,000 IU or 300,000 IU dose of Vitamin D greatly reduced growth pain in children - June 2024

 **Vitamin D Levels in Growth-Paining Children (in Turkey)** 

J Pediatr Acad -  DOI: https://doi.org/10.4274/jpea.2024.300

 **Even with very high dose the Vitamin D average level was still < 24 ng/mL**

The most common cause of non-inflammatory recurrent musculoskeletal pain in children is growing pains. History and physical examination are often sufficient to diagnose these patients. Since the exact etiology is not known, different treatments can be applied. The effect of vitamin D levels on children with growing pains was investigated. Clinical and laboratory findings of 138 pediatric patients with growing pain and 30 healthy control subjects were examined and then the changes in pain scores of children and their families with follow-up and treatment were evaluated. The pain was most commonly seen in the form of lower extremity pain at night and in girls. Although growing pains can be treated with nonpharmacological methods, there were also patients who required pharmacological treatment. Vitamin D deficiency was observed in children with growing pain. Vitamin D treatment was given to 46 patients with vitamin D deficiency. Pain scores made by both themselves and their families decreased in 91.4% of the patients who came for control. After the use of vitamin D in children with growing pains, the mean pain score reported by the children decreased from 7.26±1.757 to 2.46±2.38. The mean pain score reported by families about their children decreased from 7.56±1.97 to 2.51±2.53 after vitamin D supplementation. Although most of the time growing pain is a self-limiting clinical picture, vitamin D supplementation may be necessary after a differential diagnosis was made because of the high level of anxiety in the families of children who do not respond to non-pharmacological approaches.

#### 97% of children with growing pains had low vitamin D (Bangladesh) –  Oct 2023

 **Severity of Growing Pain in Children and its Association with Vitamin D: A Tertiary Hospital Study** 

J Bangladesh Coll Phys Surg 2023; 41: 282-286 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3329/jbcps.v41i4.68884

Background: Growing pain (GP) is the most common form of nonspecific, recurrent leg pain in children. Some studies have found an association of vitamin-D with the severity of GP and observed remarkable pain improvement after vitamin D supplementation.

Objectives: To assess the severity of GP and serum level of vitamin D in children and to determine the association between them.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Paediatrics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). Seventy children between 6­12 years were included in the study from March 2020 to August 2021. Children who fulfilled the Evans criteria of GP were enrolled and severity of GP was assessed by Wong- Baker Facies Scale in this study. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D

Results: In this study, 97.14% of growing pain patients had hypovitaminosis D and among them majority (87.14%) were vitamin D deficient. Moderate intensity of pain was found in 51.4% of children followed by severe (30%) and mild (18.6%) intensity of pain.  **Severity of pain was significantly associated with lower serum levels of vitamin D.** 

Conclusion: It may be concluded that most of the children with GP had hypovitaminosis D and severity of pain significantly increased with the decrement of serum vitamin D level.

#### 93% of children in Pakistan with growing pains had >30 ng of Vitamin D - Fall 2022

 **Frequency of Hypovitaminosis D in Children with Growing Pains** 

Shah Nawaz a	Sara Yar Khan b	Neelam Ayub c

Kalsoom Tariq d	Sikandar Ali Khan c	Bashir Khan f

Objective: To determine the frequency of Hypovitaminosis D in kids by increasing pains and to find out the relationships among biochemical biomarkers and serum vitamin D concentration levels. Study Design: An exploratory cross-sectional investigation was conducted. Methodology: Growing pains were diagnosed in 100	outpatient	children	aged 5—12	with	difuse	lower leg pains.	

The	study excluded inlants	with	arthritis,	systemic	diseases,	organic	pain,	rheumatologic	diseases,	or	rickets symptoms.

We measured total inorganic phosphate, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D3 (25- hydroxycholecalciterol). Group A had enough vitamin D3 (> 75 nmol/L), Group B had 50—75, and Group C had levels below 50. Group rates mattered at 0.05 in the chi-square test. 

Results: 9-year-olds and 60% women participated.  **7% of infants with growth pains had enough vitamin D.**  95% ot vitamin D-delicient babies had high alkaline phosphatase. 

Conclusion: Growth pains may cause hypovitaminosis D. Youngster's Vitamin D levels should be tested tor unusual leg pain. Adolecular clues cannot diagnose hypovitaminosis D.

__Vitamin D Levels in Growth-Paining Children (in Turkey)__

The most common cause of non-inflammatory recurrent musculoskeletal pain in children is growing pains. History and physical examination are often sufficient to diagnose these patients. Since the exact etiology is not known, different treatments can be applied. The effect of vitamin D levels on children with growing pains was investigated. Clinical and laboratory findings of 138 pediatric patients with growing pain and 30 healthy control subjects were examined and then the changes in pain scores of children and their families with follow-up and treatment were evaluated. The pain was most commonly seen in the form of lower extremity pain at night and in girls. Although growing pains can be treated with nonpharmacological methods, there were also patients who required pharmacological treatment. Vitamin D deficiency was observed in children with growing pain. Vitamin D treatment was given to 46 patients with vitamin D deficiency. Pain scores made by both themselves and their families decreased in 91.4% of the patients who came for control. After the use of vitamin D in children with growing pains, the mean pain score reported by the children decreased from 7.26±1.757 to 2.46±2.38. The mean pain score reported by families about their children decreased from 7.56±1.97 to 2.51±2.53 after vitamin D supplementation. Although most of the time growing pain is a self-limiting clinical picture, vitamin D supplementation may be necessary after a differential diagnosis was made because of the high level of anxiety in the families of children who do not respond to non-pharmacological approaches.

!!!!97% of children with growing pains had low vitamin D (Bangladesh) –  Oct 2023
__Severity of Growing Pain in Children and its Association with Vitamin D: A Tertiary Hospital Study__
J Bangladesh Coll Phys Surg 2023; 41: 282-286 DOI: https://doi.org/10.3329/jbcps.v41i4.68884

Background: Growing pain (GP) is the most common form of nonspecific, recurrent leg pain in children. Some studies have found an association of vitamin-D with the severity of GP and observed remarkable pain improvement after vitamin D supplementation.

Objectives: To assess the severity of GP and serum level of vitamin D in children and to determine the association between them.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Paediatrics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). Seventy children between 6­12 years were included in the study from March 2020 to August 2021. Children who fulfilled the Evans criteria of GP were enrolled and severity of GP was assessed by Wong- Baker Facies Scale in this study. Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D

Results: In this study, 97.14% of growing pain patients had hypovitaminosis D and among them majority (87.14%) were vitamin D deficient. Moderate intensity of pain was found in 51.4% of children followed by severe (30%) and mild (18.6%) intensity of pain. __Severity of pain was significantly associated with lower serum levels of vitamin D.__

Conclusion: It may be concluded that most of the children with GP had hypovitaminosis D and severity of pain significantly increased with the decrement of serum vitamin D level.

We measured total inorganic phosphate, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D3 (25- hydroxycholecalciterol). Group A had enough vitamin D3 (&gt; 75 nmol/L), Group B had 50—75, and Group C had levels below 50. Group rates mattered at 0.05 in the chi-square test. 

Results: 9-year-olds and 60% women participated. __7% of infants with growth pains had enough vitamin D. __ 95% ot vitamin D-delicient babies had high alkaline phosphatase. 

Conclusion: Growth pains may cause hypovitaminosis D. Youngster&#39;s Vitamin D levels should be tested tor unusual leg pain. Adolecular clues cannot diagnose hypovitaminosis D.
