* They want to increase vitamin D in meat products, but were restricted by how much vitamin D can be added to animal feed and did not consider having the animals outdoors.

* They tested Vitamin D production in dead pig skin

* 296 nanometer wavelength UV LEDs produced the most Vitamin D (no surprise)

> much better than 292 nm and 300 nm

* No attempt was made to pulse the UV-LEDs so as to increase peak intensity and skin depth

> Note: VitaminDWiki has had excellent success with pulsing [IR LEDs for LLLT](/posts/i-needed-more-than-vitamin-d-to-treat-my-knee-osteoarthritis)

* LEDs were purchased from http://www.s-et.com/ 

* Opinion: This does not appear to be a very cost effective way to increase Vitamin D levels in meat

> Far better to put some other forms of vitamin D into the animal feed which are not regulated

The dietary intake of vitamin D is currently below the recommended intake of 10-20 μg vitamin D/day. Foods with increased content of vitamin D or new products with enhanced vitamin D are warranted. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a potential new resource in food production lines. In the present study the exposure conditions with ultraviolet (UV) LEDs were systematically investigated in the wavelength range 280-340 nm for achieving optimal vitamin D bio-fortification in pig skin. A wavelength of 296 nm was found to be optimal for vitamin D3 production. The maximum dose of 20 kJ/m2 produced 3.5-4 μg vitamin D3/cm2 pig skin. Vitamin D3 produced was independent on the combination of time and intensity of the LED source. The increased UV exposure by UV-LEDs may be readily implemented in existing food production facilities, without major modifications to the process or processing equipment, for bio-fortifying food products containing pork skin.
