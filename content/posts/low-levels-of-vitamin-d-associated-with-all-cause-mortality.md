Context: Observational studies relating circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and dietary vitamin D intake to cardiovascular disease (CVD) have reported conflicting results.

Objective: Our objective was to investigate the association of 25OHD, dietary vitamin D, PTH, and adjusted calcium with CVD and mortality in a Scottish cohort.

Design and Setting: The MIDSPAN Family Study is a prospective study of 1040 men and 1298 women from the West of Scotland recruited in 1996 and followed up for a median 14.4 yr.

Participants: Locally resident adult offspring of a general population cohort were recruited from 1972–1976.

Main Outcome Measures: CVD events (n = 416) and all-cause mortality (n = 100) were evaluated.

Results: 25OHD was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in available plasma (n = 2081). 

Median plasma 25OHD was 18.6 ng/ml, and median vitamin D intake was 3.2 ?g/d (128 IU/d). 

Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD <15 ng/ml) was present in 689 participants (33.1%). 

There was no evidence that dietary vitamin D intake, PTH, or adjusted calcium were associated with CVD events or with mortality. 

Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with CVD (fully adjusted hazard ratio = 1.00; 95% confidence interval = 0.77–1.31). 

Results were similar after excluding patients who reported an activity-limiting longstanding illness at baseline (18.8%) and those taking any vitamin supplements (21.7%). 

However, there was some evidence vitamin D deficiency was associated with  **all-cause mortality**  (fully adjusted hazard ratio =  **2.02** ; 95% confidence interval = 1.17–3.51).

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with risk of CVD in this cohort with very low 25OHD. 

Future trials of vitamin D supplementation in middle-aged cohorts should be powered to detect differences in mortality outcomes as well as CVD.
