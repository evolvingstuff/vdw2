#### Asked ChatGPT: How does Omega-6 block Omega-3- Dec 2023

Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are both essential polyunsaturated fats that play important roles in the body. However, they have different effects and their balance in the diet is crucial for maintaining good health. Here's how omega-6 can interfere with omega-3:

1.  **Competitive Metabolism** : Both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids use the same enzymes for their metabolism in the body. Omega-6 fatty acids are metabolized by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase, which is also used by omega-3 fatty acids. When the diet is high in omega-6, these fatty acids compete for the same metabolic enzymes, reducing the amount available for omega-3 metabolism. This competition can limit the body's ability to convert alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3, into its more active forms, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

1.  **Inflammatory Balance** : Omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which are signaling molecules. In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA, produce anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. A high intake of omega-6 relative to omega-3 can shift the body's balance towards a more pro-inflammatory state, which is linked to various chronic diseases.

1.  **Cell Membrane Composition** : Both types of fatty acids are incorporated into cell membranes. A diet high in omega-6 fatty acids can alter the composition of cell membranes, potentially affecting cell function and signaling.

1.  **Chronic Diseases and Health Effects** : An imbalance favoring omega-6 over omega-3 has been associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, inflammatory diseases, and certain cancers. It is suggested that a lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is more desirable in reducing the risk of these diseases.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">To verify and expand upon this information, let me find some references for you.</span>** 

Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are essential polyunsaturated fats that are crucial for human health, but their interaction and the balance between them are complex and have significant implications. Here's a summary of the key findings from various studies:

1.  **General Health Impact** : Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are known to influence oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key factors in the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases [ **URL** ](%20https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34371930/#:~:text=%23%20%E3%80%900%E2%80%A0Beneficial%20Outcomes%20of%20Omega,communicable%20diseases.)

1.  **Cardiovascular Health** : There's been a growing interest in the health effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, particularly regarding cardiovascular and neurocognitive diseases. The balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is crucial here, but determining the "optimal" levels of these fatty acids is not straightforward due to various factors in measurement and expression. [ **URL** ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29599053/)

> Also, studies have shown the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids, like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on cardiovascular outcomes, although there's some variability in the treatment effects of EPA vs. EPA+DHA [ **URL** ](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00277-7/fulltext#:~:text=%23%20%E3%80%901%E2%80%A0Effect%20of%20omega,EPA%2BDHA%20treatment%20effects)

1.  **Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease** : Observational studies support the use of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, randomized controlled trials have often reported neutral findings, suggesting a more complex relationship between these fatty acids and heart health [ **URL** ](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(20)30148-0/fulltext#:~:text=,have%20often%20reported%20neutral%20findings)

1.  **Dietary Imbalance and Health Effects** : There has been a significant change in our diets, with an increase in consumption of vegetable oils rich in omega-6 and a depletion of omega-3 fatty acids, leading to an imbalance. This dietary shift has important implications for health, particularly in relation to glucose metabolism and possibly other metabolic processes [ **URL** ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10301273/#:~:text=,6)

1.  **Cancer Risk** : The relationship between long-chain omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), omega-6, and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intakes and cancer risk is still unclear. More research is needed to fully understand how these fatty acids might influence cancer development and progression [ **URL** ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-020-0761-6#:~:text=%23%20%E3%80%904%E2%80%A0Omega,We%20searched%20Medline%2C%20Embase)

In summary, both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are vital for health, but their balance is critical. High consumption of omega-6, relative to omega-3, can lead to adverse health outcomes due to competitive metabolism, inflammatory balance, and altered cell

#### High Omega-6 vs Omega-3 increases all cause mortality by ~ 1.3 X - April 2025

 **Higher ratio of plasma omega-6/omega-3 fatty acids is associated with greater risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality: A population-based cohort study in UK Biobank**

Background:

Circulating omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various chronic diseases and mortality, but results are conflicting. Few studies examined the role of omega-6/omega-3 ratio in mortality.

Methods:

We investigated plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs and their ratio in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank. Of  **85,425 participants**  who had complete information on circulating PUFAs, 6461 died during follow-up, including 2794 from cancer and 1668 from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Associations were estimated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for relevant risk factors.

Results:

Risk for all three mortality outcomes increased as the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs increased (all Ptrend <0.05). Comparing the highest to the lowest quintiles, individuals had 

* 26% (95% CI, 15–38%) higher total mortality, 

* 14% (95% CI, 0–31%) higher cancer mortality, and 

* 31% (95% CI, 10–55%) higher CVD mortality.

Moreover, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs in plasma were all inversely associated with all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality, with omega-3 showing stronger effects.

Conclusions:

Using a population-based cohort in UK Biobank, our study revealed a strong association between the ratio of circulating omega-6/omega-3 PUFAs and the risk of all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality.

Linoleic acid (LA) intake has increased dramatically in the standard American diet. LA is generally promoted as supporting human health, but there exists controversy regarding whether the amount of LA currently consumed in the standard American diet supports human health. The goal of this narrative review is to explore the mechanisms that underlie the hypothesis that excessive LA intake may harm human health.

While LA is considered to be an essential fatty acid and supports health when consumed in modest amounts, an excessive intake of LA leads to the formation of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs), impairments in mitochondrial function through suboptimal cardiolipin composition. It likely contributes to many chronic diseases that became an epidemic in the 20th century and whose prevalence continues to increase.

The standard American diet comprises  **14 to 25 times more omega-6 than omega-3 fatty acids** , with most omega-6 intake coming from LA. As LA consumption increases, the potential for OXLAM formation also increases. OXLAMs have been associated with various illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease, among others. Lowering dietary LA intake can help reduce the production and accumulation of OXLAMs implicated in chronic diseases. 

While there are other problematic components in the standard American diet, the  **half-life of LA is approximately two years** , which means the damage can be far more persistent than other dietary factors, and the impact of reducing excessive LA intake takes time. Therefore, additional research-evaluating approaches to reduce OXLAM formation and cardiolipin derangements following LA consumption are warranted.

 **STORY AT-A-GLANCE** 

* Fats are the primary building block of your cell membranes. This is one of the reasons why eating the right types of fat is so important for your health and longevity

* While most nutritional experts blame the epidemic of chronic disease on the increase in sugar consumption, the role of sugar is relatively minor when compared to the impact of seed oils

* based on how many of their carbon bonds are paired with hydrogen, there are two basic types of fatty acids: saturated fats and unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats are further subdivided into monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs), depending on how many pairs of hydrogen atoms they are missing

* Because your tissues are made up mostly of saturated and monounsaturated fats, your body requires more of them than PUFAs

* The main dietary PUFAs are omega-3 and omega-6 fats, and while your body does need these, it needs them in relatively small quantities. The most pernicious toxin in the modern diet, and the fat you need to minimize consumption of, is the omega-6 fat linoleic acid (LA). LA makes up 60% to 80% of omega-6 fats and is the primary contributor to chronic disease

 **Commonly Confused Fats** 

* It is also important to highlight a primarily plant-based omega-3 fat called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA should be distinct from LA, as they differ from a biological standpoint. LA is an omega-6 fat, and ALA is an omega-3 fat.

* do not confuse LA with CLA (conjugated linoleic acid). Although CLA is an omega-6 fat, and most think CLA and LA are interchangeable, they're not. CLA has many potent health benefits and will not cause the problems that LA does.

* up to 50% or more of the overall calories in most processed foods come from seed oils.1

* You have about 40 quadrillion to 100 quadrillion mitochondria throughout your body's cells. 

   * In 37 trillion cells - it appears that there are ~1000 mitochondria per cell - average.

 **ALEs and OXLAMs can also:** 

* Damage the cells lining your blood vessels

* Cause memory impairment and increases your risk of Alzheimer’s disease (canola oil, in particular, has been linked to Alzheimer’s)

* Strip your liver of glutathione thereby lowering your antioxidant defenses

* Inhibit delta-6 desaturase (delta-6), an enzyme involved in the conversion of short-chained omega-3s to longer chained omega-3s in your liver

* Impair your immune function and increase mortality

* Make your fat cells more insulin sensitive, thereby causing insulin resistance

* Inhibit cardiolipin, an important fat in the inner membrane of your mitochondria
