#### The Century of Evidence Putting Light Inside the Body Is A Miraculous Therapy

 **[MidWesternDoctor in Slack](https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-century-of-evidence-putting-light)** 

 **Apparently, the author/doctor had benefited from UVBI treatment of his migraine headache and had gone on the use UVBI on various patients outside of US hospitals, including COVID patients** 

* &quot;By the early 1950s, UVBI was being used in approximately 50 American hospitals (including many major ones), with many doctors reporting in the medical literature that they had used it on thousands of patients and had consistently seen immediate and miraculous results from the therapy (which included countless patients with unusually severe infections that antibiotics had failed and were very close to death) alongside a complete absence of side effects.&quot;

Contains a list of 200 medical publications of UVBI up to 2021

Author gives 10+ possible reasons that UVBI works

 **Substack has detailed description of UVBI treatment for:** 

* •Bacterial Infections

   * (e.g., sepsis, septic abortions, osteomyelitis, meningitis, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and a variety of common infections).

* •Viral Infections

   * (e.g., pneumonia, shingles, hepatitis, severe COVID-19, long COVID, polio, AIDS).

* •Cardiovascular Disorders

   * (e.g., heart attacks, angina, peripheral arterial disease, intermittent claudication, Raynaud’s, thrombophlebitis, high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension).

* •Autoimmune disorders

   * (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, eczema, multiple sclerosis, transplant rejections).

* •Abdominal Conditions

   * (e.g., liver, biliary and gallbladder diseases, pancreatitis, disseminated peritonitis, kidney diseases).

* •Surgery

   * (e.g., preventing post-operative complications such as infections or pneumonia, reducing the death rate, accelerating recovery time, and treating postoperative ileus or burns).

* •Obstetrics and Gynecology

   * (e.g., male and female fertility, preventing miscarriages, preeclampsia, having healthy babies, polycystic ovarian syndrome, pelvic inflammatory diseases).

* •Neurologic and Psychiatric Disorders

   * (e.g., depression, schizophrenia, migraine headaches, poor cerebral blood flow creating symptoms like tinnitus, a foggy head or insomnia).

Apparently, the AMA funded a study to disprove UVBI treatment. A UV opaque film was found inside of the machine after the test that prevented some the the UVB from getting to the blood

#### What are some of the studies of red or infrared light used to treat health problems - Asked Perplexity AI June 2024

Several studies have investigated the use of red and infrared light therapy for treating various health conditions:

1. Wound healing: NASA-funded research demonstrated that high-intensity red and near-infrared LEDs significantly accelerated the healing of oxygen-deprived wounds in rats and sped up the growth of skin, bone, and muscle cell cultures.

1. Musculoskeletal injuries: Studies with U.S. Navy crews showed that LED devices produced over 40% greater improvement in musculoskeletal injuries and 50% faster healing time for lacerations compared to control groups.

1. Eye conditions: Research suggested that irradiation with red LED arrays could prevent methanol-induced blindness in rats, leading to proposals for using light therapy to treat retinal ailments like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.

1. Pain and inflammation: The WARP 10 device, developed based on NASA research, was FDA-cleared for temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, arthritis, and muscle spasms.

1. Oral mucositis: A clinical trial using the WARP 75 device successfully treated acute sores in the mucus membranes of patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for bone marrow transplants.

1. Skin conditions: Studies have shown promising results for using red light therapy to treat acne vulgaris, both alone and in combination with blue light therapy.

1. Hair growth: A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy found that red light therapy increased hair density in men with androgenetic alopecia.

1. Rheumatoid arthritis: Research published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology indicated that red light therapy helped reduce pain and inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

1. Aging and wrinkles: Some studies suggest that red light therapy may help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production and improving circulation.

While these studies show promising results, it&#39;s important to note that more extensive clinical trials are still needed to fully understand the efficacy of red light therapy for many of these conditions.

##### Light treatments are difficult to compare: rarely use the same wavelength, intensity, modulation, etc.

It is not even known which combination of the variables are appropriate for which individuals and which health problems

!!!!The Century of Evidence Putting Light Inside the Body Is A Miraculous Therapy
__[https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-century-of-evidence-putting-light|MidWesternDoctor in Slack]__
__Apparently, the author/doctor had benefited from UVBI treatment of his migraine headache and had gone on the use UVBI on various patients outside of US hospitals, including COVID patients__
*&quot;By the early 1950s, UVBI was being used in approximately 50 American hospitals (including many major ones), with many doctors reporting in the medical literature that they had used it on thousands of patients and had consistently seen immediate and miraculous results from the therapy (which included countless patients with unusually severe infections that antibiotics had failed and were very close to death) alongside a complete absence of side effects.&quot;

Contains a list of 200 medical publications of UVBI up to 2021

Author gives 10+ possible reasons that UVBI works

__Substack has detailed description of UVBI treatment for:__
*•Bacterial Infections
**(e.g., sepsis, septic abortions, osteomyelitis, meningitis, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and a variety of common infections).
*•Viral Infections
**(e.g., pneumonia, shingles, hepatitis, severe COVID-19, long COVID, polio, AIDS).
*•Cardiovascular Disorders
**(e.g., heart attacks, angina, peripheral arterial disease, intermittent claudication, Raynaud’s, thrombophlebitis, high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension).
*•Autoimmune disorders
**(e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, eczema, multiple sclerosis, transplant rejections).
*•Abdominal Conditions
**(e.g., liver, biliary and gallbladder diseases, pancreatitis, disseminated peritonitis, kidney diseases).
*•Surgery
**(e.g., preventing post-operative complications such as infections or pneumonia, reducing the death rate, accelerating recovery time, and treating postoperative ileus or burns).
*•Obstetrics and Gynecology
**(e.g., male and female fertility, preventing miscarriages, preeclampsia, having healthy babies, polycystic ovarian syndrome, pelvic inflammatory diseases).
*•Neurologic and Psychiatric Disorders
**(e.g., depression, schizophrenia, migraine headaches, poor cerebral blood flow creating symptoms like tinnitus, a foggy head or insomnia).
Apparently, the AMA funded a study to disprove UVBI treatment. A UV opaque film was found inside of the machine after the test that prevented some the the UVB from getting to the blood

!!!!What are some of the studies of red or infrared light used to treat health problems - Asked Perplexity AI June 2024
Several studies have investigated the use of red and infrared light therapy for treating various health conditions:
#Wound healing: NASA-funded research demonstrated that high-intensity red and near-infrared LEDs significantly accelerated the healing of oxygen-deprived wounds in rats and sped up the growth of skin, bone, and muscle cell cultures.
#Musculoskeletal injuries: Studies with U.S. Navy crews showed that LED devices produced over 40% greater improvement in musculoskeletal injuries and 50% faster healing time for lacerations compared to control groups.
#Eye conditions: Research suggested that irradiation with red LED arrays could prevent methanol-induced blindness in rats, leading to proposals for using light therapy to treat retinal ailments like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.
#Pain and inflammation: The WARP 10 device, developed based on NASA research, was FDA-cleared for temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain, arthritis, and muscle spasms.
#Oral mucositis: A clinical trial using the WARP 75 device successfully treated acute sores in the mucus membranes of patients undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for bone marrow transplants.
#Skin conditions: Studies have shown promising results for using red light therapy to treat acne vulgaris, both alone and in combination with blue light therapy.
#Hair growth: A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy found that red light therapy increased hair density in men with androgenetic alopecia.
#Rheumatoid arthritis: Research published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology indicated that red light therapy helped reduce pain and inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
#Aging and wrinkles: Some studies suggest that red light therapy may help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by stimulating collagen production and improving circulation.
While these studies show promising results, it&#39;s important to note that more extensive clinical trials are still needed to fully understand the efficacy of red light therapy for many of these conditions.
