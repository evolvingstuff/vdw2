#### [Do Antibiotics Raise Diabetes Risk via Gut Microbiota?](https://www.curezone.org/forums/fm.asp?i=2246509) - comment on the following study

* The highest risk for diabetes was seen among people who received more than five courses of quinolones, at an adjusted  **OR of 1.37** . An increased risk of diabetes was also seen in patients who took more than five courses of tetracyclines, at an adjusted OR of 1.21.

* “When the analysis was restricted to  **type 1 diabetes** , the risk was increased only following exposure to more than five courses of penicillin or two to five courses of cephalosporin, at odds ratios of  **1.41 and 1.63** , respectively.”

#### 5 antibiotic courses increased type 1 Diabetes by 37% – Feb 2017

 **Use of antibiotics in childhood and risk of Type 1 diabetes: a population-based case-control study.** 

Diabet Med. 2017 Feb;34(2):272-277. [doi: 10.1111/dme.13262.](https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.13262.) Epub 2016 Oct 13.

AIMS:

To investigate whether the use of antibiotics from infancy to adolescence influences the risk of Type 1 diabetes.

METHODS:

We conducted a population-based case-control study, including all Type 1 diabetes cases in Denmark among children born between 1997 and 2012 (n = 1578). Odds ratios associating Type 1 diabetes with use of antibiotics were calculated using conditional logistic regression.

RESULTS:

Overall, we found no association between the use of antibiotics and risk of Type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, no associations were seen specifically for broad-spectrum, narrow-spectrum, bactericidal or bacteriostatic types of antibiotics or for the most frequently used individual classes of antibiotics. No differences were observed in subgroups defined by sex or by age at time of diagnosis. However, filling five or more antibiotic prescriptions in the first 2 years of life specifically was associated with a higher odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI 1.10-1.64). This association appeared to be driven by exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics within the second year of life.

CONCLUSION:

Antibiotic exposure in childhood is generally not associated with the risk of developing Type 1 diabetes. Future studies should investigate the effects of multiple exposures to broad-spectrum antibiotics during the second year of life.

#### Antibiotics do not increase risk of Diabetes– Nov 2017

 **Systemic use of antibiotics and risk of diabetes in adults: A nested case-control study of Alberta's Tomorrow Project.** 

Diabetes Obes Metab. 2017 Nov 20. [doi: 10.1111/dom.13163.](https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.13163.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Ye M1, Robson PJ2,3, Eurich DT1, Vena JE2, Xu JY2, Johnson JA1.

AIMS:

Previous observational studies using administrative health records have suggested an increased risk of diabetes with use of antibiotics. However, unmeasured confounding factors may explain these results. This study characterized the association between systemic use of antibiotics and risk of diabetes in a cohort of adults in Canada, accounting for both clinical and self-reported disease risk factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

In this nested case-control study, we used data from Alberta's Tomorrow Project (ATP), a longitudinal cohort study in Canada, and the linked administrative health records (2000-2015). Incident cases of diabetes were matched with up to 8 age and sex-matched controls per case. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between antibiotic exposures and incident diabetes after sequentially adjusting for important clinical and lifestyle factors.

RESULTS:

This study included 1676 cases of diabetes and 13 401 controls. Although 17.9% of cases received more than 5 courses of antibiotics, compared to 13.8% of controls (P < .0001), the association between antibiotic use and risk of diabetes was progressively reduced as important clinical and lifestyle factors were accounted for. In fully adjusted models, compared to participants with 0 to 1 courses of antibiotics, participants receiving more antibiotics had no increased risk of diabetes <span>[Odds Ratio, 0.97 (0.83-1.13) for 2 to 4 courses and 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for ≥5 courses]</span>.

CONCLUSIONS:

After adjustment for clinical and difficult-to-capture lifestyle data, we found no association between systemic use of antibiotics and risk of diabetes. Our results suggest that those positive associations observed in previous studies using only administrative records might have been confounded.
