The Magnesium Depletion Score (MDS) is a practical tool used to assess magnesium deficiency. Studies have indicated that MDS is associated with various urological conditions, such as kidney stones and the prognosis of chronic kidney disease. However, the relationship between MDS and prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between MDS and PCa. This study conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 16,043 participants from the 2005–2018 NHANES database. Subgroup analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and multivariable logistic regression were employed to examine the association between MDS and the prevalence of PCa. A total of 16,043 participants were included in this study, of whom 511 had PCa. After adjusting for all variables using multivariable logistic regression, each 1-unit increase in MDS was associated with a 26% higher prevalence of PCa (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.50). 

Additionally, compared to an MDS of 0, an MDS of 3 or higher was associated with a  **3.04-fold increase in PCa prevalence**  (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.53, 6.01). RCS analysis demonstrated a significant linear positive correlation between MDS and PCa prevalence. Subgroup analysis indicated that the positive association between MDS and PCa was generally consistent across different population groups. This study indicates a significant association between MDS and the risk of PCa, with higher MDS linked to an increased prevalence of PCa. These findings highlight the potential role of MDS in PCa. Further research is needed to determine whether a causal relationship exists between MDS and PCa, which would help assess the appropriateness of potential interventions.
