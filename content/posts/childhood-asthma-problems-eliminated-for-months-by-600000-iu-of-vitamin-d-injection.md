Loading:  **intramuscular** vitamin D injection 300,000-600,000 IU over 1-5 days

Maintenance: oral vitamin D 600 IU + calcium (30-70 mg/kg/day) for 3 months 

57%  5-8 years, 23% 9-10 years, 20% 11-12 years

*  **This was not a randomized controlled trial (RCT) - all of the children with asthma got the Vitamin D** 

*  **Since it was not a RCT it will not probably be be included in any meta-analyses of Asthma and Vitamin D** 

*  **Maintenance Dose: strangely it was too small and not proportional to body weight - as the calcium dose was** 

*  **Injection is nice, but not essential**
