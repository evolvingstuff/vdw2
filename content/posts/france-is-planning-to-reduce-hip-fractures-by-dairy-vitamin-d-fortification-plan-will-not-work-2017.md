Fact: 800 IU added to elderly reduces some hip fractures

Fact: More than 800 IU reduces far more fractures

Premise: Fortify dairy products in France so as to add 800 IU of vitamin D daily into elderly

 **Reasons why plan will fail** 

1. Elderly tend to drink little milk

1. [Most people have major problems of milk as a source of vitamin D](/posts/most-people-have-major-problems-of-milk-as-a-source-of-vitamin-d)

1. If milk is consumed, it tends to be low-fat  [2.5 less bio-available vitamin D in low-fat milk](/posts/skim-fat-milk-provides-3-percent-less-vitamin-d)

1. In France: “High in vitamin D” can be claimed if it has just 60 IU/100 grams

> = 1300 grams of milk to get 800 IU

   * = 5.3 cups of full-fat milk 

   * = 13 cups of low-fat milk =  **8/10 of a gallon** )
