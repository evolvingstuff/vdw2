#### English transcript

00:0X  all right our next speaker is Bill I say

00:0X  William B Grant has a PhD in physics

00:0X  from the University of California  Berkeley

00:1X  in 1971 he has had a 30-year career in

00:1X  atmospheric sciences with an emphasis on

00:1X  laser remote sensing of atmospheric

00:1X  constituents such as ozone and aerosols

00:2X  with positions at s RI International the

00:2X  Jet Propulsion Laboratory California

00:2X  Institute of Technology and NASA Langley

00:3X  Research Center he turned to health

00:3X  research in 1996 publishing the first

00:3X  paper linking diet to risk of

00:4X  Alzheimer's disease in 1997 followed by

00:4X  his studies of sugar fat and coronary

00:4X  heart disease in 1998 and animal

00:4X  products and cancer risk in 1998 in 1999

00:5X  he turned his attention to the role of

00:5X  solar ultraviolet B exposure in reducing

00:5X  risk of many types of cancer through

01:0X  production of vitamin D in 2012 after

01:0X  retirement from NASA in 2000 2002 after

01:0X  retirement from NASA in 2004 he moved to

01:1X  San Francisco and formed the nonprofit

01:1X  organization sunlight nutrition and

01:1X  health research center which is WWN arc

01:2X  AR CSUN AR c.org where he spends most of

01:2X  his time studying the role of UVB solar

01:3X  UVB exposure and vitamin D in reducing

01:3X  risk of cancer and many other types of

01:3X  disease he also investigates the role of

01:3X  diet in risk of Alzheimer's disease in

01:4X  cancer he has about 300 health

01:4X  publications listed at WWE become of

01:4X  which 210 are related to vitamin D with

01:5X  78% of these also on ultraviolet

01:5X  radiation in human health and 41 to diet

01:5X  and disease please welcome Bill Graham

02:0X  thank you I'm delighted to be back here

02:0X  again I really have enjoyed this

02:1X  organization I like cork you invited me

02:1X  into it about 12 or 13 years ago and

02:1X  I've didn't involve ever since but don't

02:1X  come to meetings very often now because

02:1X  it's I'm in the San Francisco and it's a

02:2X  long way down here and back let's see

02:2X  there you go

02:2X  I do receive funding from biotech pharmacal

02:3X  that's a vitamin company as a

02:3X  supplier of research grade vitamin D for

02:3X  health professionals and consumers they

02:3X  have a website biotech for McHale calm

02:4X  so I'm going to discuss a number of

02:4X  topics related to vitamin D this evening

02:4X  first of all the vitamin D physiology

02:4X  then I'm gonna put the binding

02:5X  recommendations right up in front

02:5X  because I think that's what you're most

02:5X  interested in then I'll tell you why if

02:5X  I'd be is important in terms of which

02:5X  health outcomes are related to low

03:0X  vitamin D whereas the Bundy policy

03:0X  hitted so my latest research on how

03:0X  vitamin D clinical trial should be

03:1X  conducted and then tell you where to go

03:1X  for additional information so vitamin d3

03:2X  that's cholecalciferol can be made in

03:2X  the skin or obtained from a food of

03:2X  supplements there's also a vitamin d3

03:2X  aerial cuss difficult which is made from

03:3X  mushrooms or yeast or fun gene that's

03:3X  not as effective as vitamin d3 it

03:3X  doesn't last as long and it's not clear

03:4X  that it has the same health benefits but

03:4X  some people were vegans want to have no

03:4X  animal products and all vitamin d3 is

03:4X  made from animal products or almost all

03:4X  there is a power plant source vitamin d3

03:5X  but the vegans often want to go with a

03:5X  d2 the liver converts vitamin d3 to  – – – 

03:5X  hydroxy vitamin d3 by adding a hydroxyl

04:0X  group and this is what is measured when

04:0X  you go to the doctor's office and wonder

04:0X  what your your blood level of vitamin D

04:1X  is the half-life of this 25 hydroxy

04:1X  Vaadin D is about two and a half

04:1X  weeks now a kidney converts the 25

04:2X  hydroxy body to 125 diet dihydroxy of

04:2X  vitamin D and this this and the

04:3X  parathyroid hormone PTH helped keep

04:3X  serum calcium within a tight range the

04:3X  125 increases calcium absorption from

04:4X  the intestines whereas a PTH increases

04:4X  calcium absorption from the bones so we

04:4X  have sort of a push and pull and so it's

04:4X  there's not a direct correlation between

04:5X  the amount of 25 and 125 but the more 25

04:5X  you have the more 125 you can make there

05:0X  are other actions of vitamin D and

05:0X  that's what I primarily study most of

05:0X  the action of vitamin D is through the

05:0X  125 entering the vine D receptors which

05:1X  are coupled to chromosomes in there

05:1X  every cell of the body when activated

05:1X  the VTR's control the expression of many

05:2X  genes up regulating most of them down

05:2X  regulating others and it turns out that

05:2X  not only a kidney can convert the 25 to

05:2X  125 but also other organs as needed

05:3X  so for example you cancer someplace the

05:3X  cells in that organ can also convert the

05:3X  25 to 125 and the skin it can convert 25

05:4X  to 125 now Von D also fights bacterial

05:4X  and some viral infections by inducing

05:5X  production of Catholics seitan that's

05:5X  the polypeptide with antimicrobial and

05:5X  anti endotoxin properties fine B also

05:5X  induces reduces inflammation by reducing

06:0X  a production of pro-inflammatory

06:0X  cytokines which are chemical messengers

06:0X  to underscore the importance of vitamin

06:1X  D for human health I note that skin

06:1X  pigmentation varies globally depending

06:1X  on where people live for hundreds to

06:1X  thousands of years for example the the

06:2X  Aborigines in Australia are very

06:2X  dark-skinned their ancestors were from

06:2X  the force of the Indonesia where

06:2X  where they were brown-skinned but when

06:3X  they got to Australia with no trees to

06:3X  cover them they needed a very dark skin

06:3X  to protect them from the very very

06:3X  intense UV so dark skin in the tropics

06:4X  reduces the risk of free radical

06:4X  formation and skin cancer as well as

06:4X  protecting against folate destruction

06:4X  and folate is very important for

06:5X  pregnancy and for pregnancy now as

06:5X  humans moved out of Africa started

06:5X  moving in northward they had to develop

07:0X  lighter skin in order to make enough

07:0X  vitamin D from the from the less intense

07:0X  UV and they didn't need the protection

07:0X  of the dark pigment against the free

07:1X  radicals and full of destruction what

07:1X  would happen they would get more

07:1X  infectious diseases like tuberculosis

07:1X  they would also get more rickets and

07:2X  poor bone formation and so then the

07:2X  pelvic cavity wouldn't be large enough

07:2X  to let a feed on an infant come out in

07:2X  the birth process and they hadn't

07:3X  invented c-sections thousands of years

07:3X  ago now Nina Jablonski and George

07:3X  Chaplin and made a career out of going

07:4X  around the world and measuring the un--

07:4X  UV exposed pigment in many peoples

07:4X  around the world and they have this

07:5X  developed this map of skin pigmentation

07:5X  they see very dark in the tropics where

07:5X  you have no trees brown lighter color in

08:0X  the tropical forest and very light in

08:0X  the high latitudes so now let's go to

08:0X  recommendations which I gave a talk in

08:1X  Hungary last month and after I gave all

08:1X  the information about what the benefits

08:1X  are all I wanted to know was well how

08:1X  much do I need how much should i what

08:1X  should my level be so in 2011 the

08:2X  Institute of Medicine announced that

08:2X  adults up to the age of 7 years old

08:2X  should have 600 ru per day over 70 years

08:3X  they should have editor ru per day and

08:3X  that 20 nanograms per milliliter vitamin

08:3X  D concentration was 25 hydroxy vitamin E concentration

08:4X  was just fine well it turns out that

08:4X  that was a not a very sound study first

08:5X  of all they were this was funded by the

08:5X  Food and Drug Administration and the

08:5X  National assistive health and Health

08:5X  Canada and the two US organizations

09:0X  worked very closely with Big Pharma and

09:0X  also one of the organizers one of the

09:0X  people on the committee had planned

09:1X  another major vitamin E clinical trial

09:1X  where people could take we're gonna take

09:1X  2000 IU of vitamin D per day in the

09:1X  treatment arm but they got all my in the

09:2X  treatment or the control arm could take

09:2X  as much as the Institute of Medicine

09:2X  recommended so in order not to sabotage

09:2X  her clinical trial she pushed I think

09:3X  very hard for these recommendations but

09:3X  in order to reach these recommendations

09:3X  they did three things which which are

09:3X  not very scientific

09:4X  first of all they ignored all non

09:4X  skeletal effects they ignored cancer

09:4X  cardiovascular disease autoimmune

09:4X  diseases respiratory infections etc

09:4X  second they demanded published

09:5X  randomized controlled clinical trials of

09:5X  a vitamin D and at a time when they did

09:5X  a study all I could point to was

10:0X  clinical trials for bone health

10:0X  the third thing they did was they took a

10:0X  study from Germany which looked at

10:0X  people who died in automobile accidents

10:1X  so they're healthy people just happen to

10:1X  die prematurely and in the study they

10:1X  they looked at the osteoid amount of the

10:2X  bones noted as the unn mineralized

10:2X  calcium in the bones sort of liquid or

10:2X  gelatin life and they also compared the

10:3X  25 hydroxy vitamin D concentrations with

10:3X  with the amount of this poor bone

10:3X  mineralization and what they did was

10:3X  they ignored the findings between 20 and

10:4X  30 nanograms in terms of they still had

10:4X  a few at that point who had on

10:4X  mineralized bone but they said that

10:5X  wasn't important that most of the people

10:5X  with underlies bone were below 20

10:5X  nanograms so we're gonna stick with 20

10:5X  he has been shown in many comments later

11:0X  on that that was a major mistake and I

11:0X  think the Institute of Medicine now

11:0X  realizes that yeah but it took quite a

11:0X  few years then I realized that now in

11:0X  2011 The Endocrine Society led by

11:1X  Michael Holick team led by Michael

11:1X  Holick published a recommendation for

11:1X  dealing with a vitamin D deficiency now

11:1X  it's the first one the Institute of

11:2X  Medicine was for the general public healthy or not

11:2X  the endocrine Society was dealing with

11:2X  with people being treated by doctors

11:2X  fortified in D deficiency so they

11:3X  recommended a 1000 2000 IU per day of

11:3X  item d2 or d3 and a serum vitamin e

11:3X  concentration of around 30 nano grams

11:4X  per milliliter at least they considered

11:4X  20 deficient between 20 and 30

11:4X  insufficient above 30 sufficient however

11:5X  there are finally advocacy organizations

11:5X  which I'll name at the end who have

11:5X  looked carefully at the the general

11:5X  literature that comes out on a daily and

12:0X  a weekly basis and have some of these

12:0X  people have written peer-reviewed papers

12:0X  on the benefits of item D and they've

12:0X  looked at people with higher

12:1X  concentrations and and how much better

12:1X  they do in terms of athletic performance

12:1X  or lack of disease and they're

12:1X  recommending around 2,000 to 5,000 IU

12:2X  per day vitamin d3 not skipping vitamin

12:2X  d2 and a serum concentration of around

12:2X  40 to 60 nano grams per milliliter

12:2X  one of the reasons for saying 40 to 60

12:3X  is that looking at healthy Africans

12:3X  modern-day Africans who are outdoors

12:3X  every day with dark skin with with some

12:4X  clothing I mean they're not not just

12:4X  annoying Clause but they have a fair

12:4X  amount of clothing on they have around

12:4X  forty five nanograms per milliliter

12:5X  serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D and so you

12:5X  have these three recommendations so well

13:0X  now just to show a picture here

13:0X  Roger bouillon on the on the left is one

13:0X  of the most prominent finally

13:0X  researchers in Europe believe he's in

13:1X  Belgium he's a lot of European leaders

13:1X  are the 20 nanograms per milliliter camp

13:2X  Michael Holick on the other hand is the

13:2X  leader of the 13 anagram plus camp now

13:2X  there are three sources of vitamin D the

13:3X  sunlight is the primary source this map

13:3X  this is a shows on the bottom is a month

13:4X  of the year from from January through

13:4X  December along the y-axis you have the

13:4X  latitude from zero the tropics up to 90

13:5X  degrees at the top and the colors

13:5X  indicate how much time you have to be in

14:0X  the Sun in order to make I see how much

14:0X  well let's see if you okay if it's red

14:1X  you cannot make any vitamin D if it's in

14:1X  the blue the purple range you can make

14:2X  some vitamin E it's gonna take longer

14:2X  like maybe up to half an hour an hour to

14:2X  be in the Sun and if it's black you can

14:2X  make it fairly easily so we're about 30

14:3X  degrees north latitude here so in the

14:3X  winter we have a difficult time making

14:3X  vitamin D but by March or April through

14:4X  about October we can make a fair amount

14:4X  of vitamin D and this this map was 400 – -

14:4X  IU of a per day of vitamin D now if you

14:5X  need 2,000 to 4,000 5,000 IU per day

14:5X  this is the this scale would be changed

14:5X  also it turns out that there's there's a

14:5X  shadow rule the dermatologist like to

15:0X  tell you if your shadow is shorter than

15:0X  you are stay out of the Sun or cover up

15:0X  or use sunscreen the vitamin E advocates

15:0X  like to say unless your shadow is

15:1X  shorter than you are you're not gonna

15:1X  make much vitamin D so that means you

15:1X  want to go out in your solar noon you

15:1X  want to go out in the in the summer

15:1X  spring summer and fall you want to

15:2X  expose as much of your body as possible

15:2X  you want to one of the reasons for going

15:2X  out midday in addition is that the ratio

15:2X  of UVA to UVB changes the shorter the

15:3X  wavelength the more scattering there is

15:3X  in the atmosphere and the way you can

15:3X  tell that is the sky is blue and clouds

15:4X  are orange so as a sunset sunrise the

15:4X  Sun goes the sun rays go through a very

15:4X  very large path and the shorter

15:4X  wavelengths are scattering the

15:5X  wavelengths much more rapidly than they

15:5X  are the long wavelengths so the orange

15:5X  gets to the clouds the blue gets to the

15:5X  sky well UVB is much shorter than the

16:0X  blue and so it's scattered even more in

16:0X  fact even if you're under an umbrella

16:0X  you're going to get UVB impinging on you

16:0X  from the sides the the the the diffuse

16:1X  scattering but the UVB the UVA is going

16:1X  to be less scatter than UVB in fact UVB

16:1X  is about three to five percent of total

16:2X  UV and the rest is UVA

16:2X  the problem with UVA is that it

16:2X  penetrates the skin deeper and is more

16:2X  important more responsible for melanoma

16:3X  and basal cell carcinoma then UVB is so

16:3X  if you went out morning evening you're

16:3X  more likely to get melanoma but no

16:4X  vitamin D so I was in a hungry last  month

16:4X  went over there ten conferences in

16:4X  Warsaw and Thessaloniki and stopped off

16:5X  in Budapest and found this this like a

16:5X  porcupine with sign under saying Sun so

16:5X  the Sun is one way to get your your your

17:0X  vitamin D but you can also get it from a

17:0X  solarium the indoor tanning booths maybe

17:0X  have two to four percent UVB in the UV

17:1X  if you go in for tanning you're going to

17:1X  see how much longer they need to for

17:1X  vitamin D production it turns out that

17:1X  after you make that up to 20 thousand

17:1X  international units of vitamin D from

17:2X  whole body exposure in a Sun and half an

17:2X  hour to an hour the body's that the UV

17:2X  starts destroying the metabolites of

17:2X  vitamin D so he can never make too much

17:3X  vitamin D in the Sun now the other

17:3X  sources of vitamin D are supplements and

17:3X  diet and in terms of diet its animal

17:4X  products like seafood but it turns out

17:4X  that that a study in England found that

17:4X  the people with the highest vitamin D

17:5X  concentrations were not the fish eaters

17:5X  it was the meat eaters the vegans had

17:5X  the lowest amount the vegetarians a

17:5X  little bit higher but there is about a

18:0X  1/8 nanogram per milliliter difference

18:0X  between the meat eaters and the vegans

18:0X  the reason is that meat has vitamin D as

18:0X  25 hydroxy vitamin D so most of the food

18:1X  tables that talk about vitamin D do not

18:1X  read do not include that in the study so

18:2X  all these food frequency tables and how

18:2X  much find here get from fewer eggs and

18:2X  from your milk and so on they would find

18:2X  about 250 to 300 IU per day in the American diet

18:3X  not counting what's in a meat

18:3X  and of course 250 and 300 are you per

18:3X  day is not enough to to do much now

18:3X  there are other effects of UV exposure

18:4X  one thing you do is you get beta

18:4X  endorphins which help reduce pain and

18:4X  help you feel better

18:5X  in fact the dermatologists realize that

18:5X  people often go to tanning beds on a

18:5X  regular basis because they get an

18:5X  endorphin high and the claim is that

19:0X  they're getting addicted to tanning

19:0X  because of the beta endorphins mike my

19:0X  thought is that anything that has

19:0X  long-term benefits nature and sometimes

19:1X  provides short-term benefits to make you

19:1X  understand that their long-term benefits

19:1X  and so I think there's a you know should

19:1X  be applauded rather than criticize

19:2X  another thing is you can release my

19:2X  trick oxide subcutaneous nitrogen

19:2X  compounds which can lead to lower blood

19:2X  pressure in fact if you look at the

19:3X  latitudinal distribution of blood

19:3X  pressure it's lowest in the tropics and

19:3X  highest in the high latitudes of course

19:3X  that could also be related to dietary

19:3X  factors but but it could be related to

19:3X  some what - to UV there are some we'll

19:4X  see multiple sclerosis has a very

19:4X  pronounced latitudinal effect and four

19:4X  years of thought that that was because

19:5X  of vitamin D production but now both

19:5X  human studies and and animal studies

19:5X  have indicated that there are benefits

19:5X  of UV aside from vitamin D production

20:0X  that reduced the risk of multiple

20:0X  sclerosis of course there are other

20:0X  effects you can reset your biological

20:0X  clock through the blue light around 420

20:1X  nanometers I found out when I went to

20:1X  say Sweden in February I was there for

20:1X  two weeks and never got on Swedish time

20:1X  and last month I was in in Warsaw for a

20:2X  week and it rained every day and I did

20:2X  not get on Warsaw time finally in in

20:2X  Budapest I started with sunlight I start

20:2X  to get over on the European time also

20:3X  turns out that as I was so later than

20:3X  just getting outside and exercising is

20:3X  very beneficial and has health effects you

20:4X  tentative of vitamin D so those most

20:4X  likely to have low vitamin E

20:4X  concentrations are those spending most

20:4X  time indoors this will also include

20:5X  those who have do shift work and sleep

20:5X  during the day because they work at

20:5X  night not being the Sun nurse solar noon

20:5X  went with sufficient body surface

20:5X  exposed dark-skinned people I'm working

21:0X  on a manuscript on the health benefits

21:0X  of vitamin D for dark-skinned people in

21:0X  the United States we're going to Bruce

21:0X  Ames on this and see if the average the

21:1X  mean casa

21:1X  25 hydroxy vitamin d concentration for white

21:1X  adult American Americans is around 21 ?

21:2X  nanograms per milliliter of course our

21:2X  seasonal variation is gonna be a factor

21:2X  of 2 between summer and winter for

21:2X  Hispanics is more like 21 nanograms and

21:3X  for black Americans and more like 1 ?

21:3X  nanograms so yeah in Africa they had all

21:4X  the vitamin E they needed but not here

21:4X  in the United States those who are

21:4X  overweight or obese I generally have

21:4X  much lower body concentrations than 

21:4X  those who are normal weight wearing

21:5X  sunscreen or even wearing using skin

21:5X  lightening cream reduces the vitamin E

21:5X  production and it turns out older folks

22:0X  over the age of 60 and perhaps even

22:0X  little bit younger have less of the 7 d

22:0X  high high low cholesterol in a thinner

22:0X  skin that that is converted to two

22:1X  vitamin D and salami didn't may need to

22:1X  stay in the Sun two to three to four

22:1X  times longer to make the same amount of

22:1X  vitamin D so there are values of

22:2X  measuring 25 hydroxy vitamin D and also

22:2X  turns out that even if you take a

22:3X  thousand or 2,000 I you if I marry per

22:3X  day there's a large variation in the

22:3X  response to to vitamin D some people may

22:4X  make twice as much 25 from the same out

22:4X  of oral vitamin D and turns out it

22:4X  depends on whether you take it with a

22:5X  large meal so it goes slow

22:5X  intestines whether you're taking more

22:5X  magnesium to help conversion 225 etc etc

22:5X  so if you really want to know where your

23:0X  your concentration is you really ought

23:0X  to have your 25 hydroxy vitamin D

23:0X  measured you can have your doctor do it

23:0X  but you can also go to grassroots health

23:1X  net or the Van Dien Council org and both

23:1X  of them sell a blood spot kit and you

23:2X  get a little Lance you draw three or

23:2X  four spots of blood and put it on a card

23:2X  there's dried blood just sent back to

23:2X  them they they sent it to a laboratory

23:2X  and they it's very accurate they use

23:3X  Hema they use an average Hema crit value

23:3X  for the entire population around well so

23:3X  if your Hema crypt is somewhat different

23:4X  from from normal that might be a slight

23:4X  error but I've checked it out some time

23:4X  ago and when I was taking more like

23:4X  $5,000 per day and I got 65 67 and 6 -?

23:5X  nanograms per milliliter depending on

23:5X  the blood spot test

23:5X  and two of the wet chemistry labs so I

24:0X  think they're quite a Qi accurate

24:0X  grassroots health also has a program

24:0X  where you can have your your 25 hydroxy

24:0X  dividing measured every six months and

24:1X  you're then entered into a scientific

24:1X  study they want you to stay in it for

24:1X  about five years they'll ever ask your

24:1X  health question how's your health what

24:1X  did you did you fall did you get sick

24:1X  etc etc and they've actually used these

24:2X  results in several peer-reviewed

24:2X  publications so now we get into the

24:2X  benefits why you really want vitamin D

24:3X  I'm gonna skip bones because I really

24:3X  haven't study bones that was sort of the

24:3X  classical vitamin D area and it's been

24:3X  the last almost two decades now that the

24:4X  non skeletal effects have become very

24:4X  important and that's what I've studied

24:4X  so there's cancer there's respiratory

24:4X  tract infections there's adverse

24:5X  pregnancy and birth outcomes premature

24:5X  death autism and ADHD dental caries poor

24:5X  sleep cognitive dysfunction Alzheimer

25:0X  disease erectile dysfunction and low testosterone

25:0X  so there's said to be something for

25:0X  everybody in here if not you your

25:0X  children or your grandchildren so the

25:1X  the first link between UV exposure and

25:1X  lower risk of cancer was made by the

25:1X  brothers cedric and frank garland who as

25:2X  beginning graduate students at johns

25:2X  hopkins school of public health and

25:2X  knights en 74 saw a map something like

25:2X  this it only had five color scales

25:3X  instead of ten but they saw that there

25:3X  was lower colon cancer in the southwest

25:3X  in higher colon cancer in northeast they

25:3X  just driven driven from Sandy Hill to

25:4X  Maryland and then it was very sunny in

25:4X  the southwest and not very sunny in the

25:4X  Northeast so they hypothesized that

25:4X  since the primary the 

25:5X  largest physiological effect of sunlight

25:5X  is widen D production that bottom D must

25:5X  reduce the risk of cancer well it took

26:0X  them six years to get that paper

26:0X  published and then it was an in a

26:0X  British Journal which is finally finally

26:0X  published in but nobody really took much

26:1X  notice of it in 1985 they show that

26:1X  dietary vitamin D was linked to low

26:1X  cancer risk in 1989 they showed that low

26:2X  serum 25 hydroxy vitamin is linked to

26:2X  low colon cancer risk

26:2X  they also extended this to breast cancer

26:2X  and ovarian cancer somebody else did

26:3X  prostate cancer and lymphoma but you can

26:3X  understand that since no I was gonna get

26:3X  rich selling vitamin D or selling

26:4X  sunlight that the medical system had

26:4X  just sort of said not much so I came

26:4X  along in 1999 after doing some work

26:4X  mentioned on on dietary factors and I

26:5X  saw these new maps that were published

26:5X  by the National Institutes of Health and

26:5X  I saw all the read of the Northeast

27:0X  except for prostate cancer was in the

27:0X  northwest and I said gee maybe I can

27:0X  explain this based on dietary factors

27:0X  well I took two weeks to realize that we

27:1X  eat the same food countrywide except in

27:1X  the South would have Allah barbecue now

27:1X  if you look at these you'll see very

27:1X  similar patterns breast

27:1X  again high mortality rates in the  Northeast

27:2X  but you have some also some high breast

27:2X  cancer rates along the West Coast turns

27:2X  out that along the coast you have more

27:2X  clouds and fog and so people are not

27:3X  getting as much UVB along the coast that

27:3X  they were inland so breast cancer is not

27:3X  quite as strong a link between UVB

27:3X  Vaughn B and in reduced risk as colon

27:4X  cancer for kidney cancer you'll see down

27:4X  in Louisiana some hot spots that's

27:4X  because of the chemicals in the chemical

27:5X  manufacturing there stomach cancer you

27:5X  sees a lot of red along the Mexican border

27:5X  that's because of hygiene and much more

27:5X  h pylori in among mexicans so we get

28:0X  more stomach cancer prostate cancer is weird

28:0X  you see the red now is shifted more to

28:0X  the northwest and the blue more to the

28:1X  southeast it turns out that both low and

28:1X  high 25 hydroxy vitamin D have about the

28:1X  equal risk for prostate cancer there's

28:2X  some benefit of Von D in fighting

28:2X  aggressive prostate cancer but it turns

28:2X  out that that calcium is an important

28:3X  risk factor for prostate cancer and

28:3X  since one of the benefits of the effects

28:3X  of vitamin D is to increase absorption

28:3X  of calcium it could be that there's a

28:4X  sort of a trade-off between having too

28:4X  much vitamin D and inducing too much

28:4X  calcium absorbtion that may play a role

28:5X  here it's still being debated by the the

28:5X  in the peer review literature I don't

28:5X  have a definitive answer on that but so

28:5X  what I did I got the NASA data for UVB

29:0X  at the surface for July 1992 and you see

29:0X  it's very asymmetrical the the highest

29:1X  rates are in the southwest Arizona New

29:1X  Mexico the lowest rates are northeast

29:1X  and the reason you have higher UVB in

29:1X  the west and an East is that the surface

29:1X  elevation tends to be higher we have

29:2X  more mountains and and even the arm like

29:2X  the Nevada desert is higher than

29:2X  then than a sea level and then you have

29:2X  the westerly winds have to cross the

29:3X  Rocky Mountains and in doing so they

29:3X  pushed the tropopause higher and make

29:3X  the stratospheric ozone layer thinner

29:3X  and it's the ozone in the stratosphere

29:3X  that blocks the UVB so you have less

29:4X  absorption unless scattering in the

29:4X  atmosphere so you have more UVB here in

29:4X  the east you also have more clouds and

29:5X  aerosols which is not reflected in this

29:5X  map but but also plays a role so from

29:5X  ecological studies we found about 15 to

30:0X  20 types of cancer that are reduced from

30:0X  UVB exposure and we think and we have

30:1X  evidence for a lot of these that higher

30:1X  25 hydroxy vine D levels are correlated

30:1X  with lower cancer risk

30:1X  so either incidence or mortality rates

30:2X  so it's colon esophageal laryngeal oral

30:2X  pharyngeal rectal small intestine the

30:2X  female cancers breast in the material

30:3X  ovarian and Evolver urogenital bladder

30:3X  kidney prostate and testicular

30:3X  miscellaneous organs gallbladder lung

30:3X  pancreatic and thyroid and the blood

30:4X  cancers lymphoma leukemia non-hodgkins lymphoma

30:4X  now how much vitamin what's the

30:5X  correlation between 25 hydroxy vitamin D

30:5X  and cancer incidence well I made this is

30:5X  sort of a graphical meta-analysis now

31:0X  I've taken 11 studies from seven

31:0X  countries and merge them together by

31:1X  adjusting the the odds ratio with

31:1X  respect to the 25 hydroxy Von D so

31:1X  they're all laying the same line and now

31:2X  the units here are Nana moles per liter

31:2X  you divide by 2.5 to get nanograms per

31:2X  milliliter so what you see is below

31:2X  about 20 nanograms you get a steep rise

31:3X  in the risk and when you get out to

31:3X  about 40 nano grams you still have some

31:3X  reduced risk but you're slowing down

31:4X  the the the the increase the reduction

31:4X  in odds ratio the the dash dash lines

31:5X  and outside shield a 95% confidence

31:5X  intervals there was this is the

31:5X  uncertainty from  the  measurements

32:0X  I mean sorry we have a this slope like

32:0X  this and this seems to be typical for

32:0X  other health outcomes as well although

32:0X  for some diseases you may be a threshold

32:1X  at twenty or thirty nanograms more than

32:1X  forty or fifty nanograms like for cancer

32:1X  and now we have results from this was a

32:2X  recent clinical trial conducted into

32:2X  Nebraska with postmenopausal women with

32:2X  an average BMI of about 31 and a

32:3X  baseline 25 hydroxy vitamin D of around

32:3X  33 nanograms

32:4X  body mass index BMI so these were obese

32:4X  people on average with high 25 hydroxy

32:4X  but indeed there were about a I think

32:5X  was a thousand women involved for four

32:5X  years and they were given $2,000 per day

33:0X  plus about a gram of calcium or placebo

33:0X  or yeah or placebo and it turns out that

33:1X  in the clinical trial in the

33:1X  intention-to-treat they had one more

33:1X  cancer case in the treatment arm then

33:1X  then would be the case if they had less

33:2X  than a one in 20 chance that this was a

33:2X  an effect found by chance there was a P

33:2X  was less P was 0.06 instead of 0.05 and

33:3X  so when the papers published JAMA said

33:3X  on news release saying clinical trial

33:3X  shows that vitamin D does not

33:3X  significantly reduce the risk of cancer

33:4X  but the people at Creighton University

33:4X  along with with people from grassroots

33:4X  health and Keith beggarly said now wait

33:4X  a minute if we look at the serum 2X  33:5X  hydroxy of

33:5X  the most the most recent measurement

33:5X  before they developed cancer we find

33:5X  that those that had between 40 and and

34:0X  80 nanograms per milliliter has

34:0X  significantly reduced risk of cancer

34:0X  compared to those with less than 4 -“

34:1X  nanograms familiar but since they have

34:1X  not specified this as an outcome in the

34:1X  protocol JAMA made them put it in the

34:1X  online appendix the supplementary files

34:2X  which was not seen by most people

34:2X  Creighton University however issued a

34:2X  press release saying see we found a

34:2X  benefit and so we had the two competing

34:3X  press releases and that who have people

34:3X  saw both were a little confused for

34:3X  cardiovascular disease here's another

34:3X  observational study meta-analysis

34:4X  showing that below 20 nanograms per

34:4X  milliliter there's an increased risk of

34:4X  cardiovascular disease unfortunately

34:4X  there have been no clinical trials that

34:5X  have confirmed that giving people

34:5X  vitamin D and reduce the risk of

34:5X  cardiovascular disease so the question

34:5X  is is this maybe because they are out of

35:0X  doors more maybe they're exercising more

35:0X  out of doors maybe they're eating

35:0X  different diet or is there vitamin D

35:0X  maybe it's a long-term vitamin D effect

35:1X  and if you do a two to four year study

35:1X  you don't find the effect so this is

35:1X  still sort of up in the air about

35:1X  cardiovascular disease seasonal

35:2X  influenza dr. John Connell who runs the

35:2X  vitamin D council proposed in 2006 that

35:2X  influenza was largely seasonal due to

35:3X  seasonal variations and UVB doses he had

35:3X  been given being giving his he worked at

35:3X  a task Adaro hospital for the clinically

35:3X  insane he'd been giving his patients

35:4X  5000 IU per day and in 2004-2005 when an

35:4X  influenza epidemic came through the area

35:4X  his patients were largely spared so they

35:5X  got him thinking about well maybe

35:5X  vitamin D does reduce the risk of

35:5X  influenza in fact shortly after his

35:5X  papers published the results of a

36:0X  clinical trial involving postmenopausal

36:0X  women in Long Island was was reanalyzed

36:0X  and they found that indeed those taking

36:0X  $2,000 per day had very few influenza or

36:1X  cold events whereas those taking 800 had

36:1X  several and those taking 400 are you had

36:1X  quite a few so that was one clinical

36:1X  trial that that showed that yes finally

36:2X  done reduce did reduce the risk of

36:2X  influenza and then a one involving

36:2X  Japanese school children show that it

36:2X  reduced type a but not type B influenza

36:2X  I might add that cold temperature and

36:3X  low humidity also in contribute to the

36:3X  seasonality because the influenza virus

36:3X  lives better in a cold dry environment

36:4X  so that's why it can be passed from

36:4X  person to person in the winter but on

36:4X  the other hand it's the volunteers can

36:4X  help you induce Catholic sidon to fight

36:4X  the influenza pregnancy clinical trials

36:5X  in South Carolina found that pregnant

36:5X  women have better pregnancy and birth

36:5X  outcomes by taking 4060 400 IU per day

36:5X  of 1 D 3 and reaching 40 nanograms per

37:0X  milliliter 25 for dr. c ymd the reason

37:0X  is that above 40 nanograms

37:0X  the 125 dihydroxy of vitamin D

37:1X  concentration is stabilized

37:1X  leaving to improve gene expression and

37:1X  there's ever a period of life when gene

37:1X  expressions important is during the

37:2X  fetal development period so the benefits

37:2X  of IMD during pregnancy includes reduced

37:2X  risk of primary c-section delivery on

37:2X  c-section delivery

37:2X  well vaginal delivery is important to

37:3X  give the the infant the the gut biome it

37:3X  needs to to get off to healthy immune

37:3X  start reduced risk of gestational

37:3X  diabetes reduce risk of preterm birth

37:4X  and for the infants reduced risk of low

37:4X  for gestational weight reduced risk of

37:4X  autism and reduced risk of asthma this

37:5X  is from the studies in South Carolina

37:5X  and it's showing that below below twenty

37:5X  six point five nanograms per milliliter

37:5X  there's a reduction in the gestational

38:0X  age above that there seems to be a

38:0X  plateau so here's another benchmark for

38:0X  pregnant women in terms of overall age

38:1X  adjusted mortality rate standard Garlin

38:1X  and company advertised

38:1X  analyzed 32 observational studies and

38:2X  found that it took 36 nanograms per

38:2X  milliliter before the mortality rates

38:3X  plateaued and you see there's a pretty

38:3X  much a linear rise to twice the

38:3X  mortality rate at lower local of 1 -?

38:4X  nanograms familiar as adult mortality so

38:4X  I've done my own analysis where I looked

38:5X  at disease rates in in various countries

38:5X  and the observational studies for the

38:5X  relationship between 25 hydroxy body and

39:0X  the incidence or mortality rate and

39:0X  found that if everyone well the global

39:0X  average 25 hydroxy varney is around 2 -?

39:1X  nanograms it turns out because of skin

39:1X  pigmentation varying no matter whether

39:1X  you where you live the population

39:1X  average is around 22 nanograms unless

39:1X  you're in the Middle Eastern country and

39:2X  where to any close then it's gonna be

39:2X  lower if you're african-american it's

39:2X  gonna be lower and so on but anyway if

39:2X  you increase from 22 to 44 nanograms it

39:3X  appears that the vitamin d sensitive

39:3X  mortality rate would reduce by about 2 -? percent

39:3X  and that's accounts for about half of a

39:3X  and the deaths and so this would lead to

39:4X  a life expectancy increase in about two years

39:4X  athletic performance again John Cornell

39:4X  wrote a paper I think into 2009 and he

39:5X  went through a number of reasons why he

39:5X  thought that there'd be better athletic

39:5X  performance for one thing he point out

39:5X  that the Mexican Olympics 1968 had a lot

40:0X  of World Records and a lot of people had

40:0X  gone there to to practice before had to

40:0X  get used to the altitude he thought it

40:0X  was not the altitude but the UVB and the

40:1X  vitamin D so he published this 2009 in a

40:1X  sports medicine journal and as a result

40:1X  the Chicago Blackhawks became the first

40:2X  vitamin team in modern professional

40:2X  sports became the first time the team in

40:2X  modern professional sports history and

40:2X  according to John sources the Black Hawk

40:3X  team physician became began diagnosing and treating

40:3X  finding efficiency in all blackhawk

40:3X  players about 18 months ago written in

40:3X  2010 and apparently most players were

40:4X  taking 5,000 IU per day after losing

40:4X  many seasons last year the Blackhawks

40:4X  came out of nowhere to get the Western

40:4X  Conference Finals

40:4X  this year they're playing even better so

40:5X  one thing is going to do is reduce their

40:5X  risk of influenza and Kohl's and all

40:5X  sorts of other respiratory infections

40:5X  the other thing is going to do is reduce

40:5X  the risk of stress fractures another

41:0X  thing a faster healing of wounds so very

41:0X  important

41:0X  Don and I to John also wrote the first

41:1X  paper on vitamin D and the risk of

41:1X  autism I worked with him in 2013 we got

41:1X  the Provost data for children ages 6 to

41:2X  17 years as a function of state I looked

41:2X  at those versus UVB doses in the summer

41:2X  for the well actually of October and

41:2X  found that there was an inverse

41:3X  correlation between UVB and risk of

41:3X  autism it turns out that African

41:3X  Americans have higher rates of autism

41:3X  than white Americans their darker skin

41:4X  making less vitamin D and there are

41:4X  mechanisms to explain why find D

41:4X  deficiency in both in in in utero and

41:5X  early life would lead to increased risk

41:5X  of autism ADHD it has a pattern which

42:0X  you see the lower rates in the Southwest

42:0X  higher rates in the east and northeast

42:0X  again as sort of looks like the UVB

42:1X  inverse of UVB dental carries it turns

42:1X  out that there were data from the 20s

42:1X  30s and 40s if I plotted the the the

42:2X  dental health rank versus UVB dose you

42:2X  see that below about 6.5 kilojoules per

42:3X  meter squared there was a linear slope

42:3X  upwards and above that there was a

42:3X  plateau in fact even a paper from 186 -?

42:3X  showed that if you looked at the Union

42:4X  Army soldiers those from Maine and New

42:4X  Hampshire had lost quite a few teeth

42:4X  why time you got to Kentucky or so they

42:4X  had most of T still intact so even then

42:5X  there was an effect of UV on dental  health

42:5X  in fact the first clinical trial on

42:5X  vitamin D was for children in England in

43:0X  1928 giving them body and looking at

43:0X  dental caries and they found that yes

43:0X  they reduce the risk of dental caries

43:0X  and the woman doing this study said that

43:1X  the bacteria were dead

43:1X  she didn't know why but we know why now

43:1X  and this here shows that that there were

43:1X  a number of studies never clinical

43:2X  trials in the 30s and 40s

43:2X  we showed a 50% reduction in dental

43:2X  caries for children taking a vitamin

43:2X  game sleep turns out that raising 2 -?

43:3X  hydroxido into 60 to 70 grams per

43:3X  milliliter does improve sleep however

43:3X  the women doctor gummy enact doing this

43:3X  study found that after two years the

43:4X  people who started reporting systemic

43:4X  pain one of her patients helped her

43:4X  realize that it was because they were

43:5X  becoming a vitamin D vitamin B deficient

43:5X  the back gut bacteria producing finally

43:5X  when you sleep you restore the body

43:5X  through methylation and methylation

43:5X  requires B vitamins and so they're using

44:0X  up some of the vitamins in the gut and

44:0X  when she gave them be 104 which has the

44:0X  multiple beef in a couple months they

44:0X  got the gut back in shape and pain went

44:1X  away and they were fine there's also

44:1X  fine the verbal fluency cognitive decline

44:1X  there's Alzheimer's disease and dementia

44:2X  this looks like below 20 nanograms

44:2X  there's a problem erectile dysfunction

44:2X  below 20 nanograms per milliliter

44:3X  testosterone there's a study involving

44:3X  obese people in Austria and they found

44:3X  that by giving them vitamin D they did

44:3X  increase their testosterone in fact I've

44:4X  myself and two other men taking high

44:4X  doses of vitamin D found that when they

44:4X  were up around 60 or 70 nanograms per

44:4X  milliliter that they got the

44:4X  testosterone up so it's a in fact that

44:5X  could help improve athletic performance

44:5X  because testosterone helps muscles

44:5X  surgery turns out that people who go

45:0X  into surgery with higher 25 hydroxy

45:0X  Vandy recover more quickly

45:0X  wounds heal faster burns heal faster so

45:1X  whereas widened D policy headed well we

45:1X  have four or five or six major one D

45:1X  supplementation trials which will

45:2X  complete data collection this year next

45:2X  year and then analyze the results they

45:2X  generally use about 2000 IU per day or

45:3X  $100,000 per month and these studies as

45:3X  imperfect as they are will provide the

45:3X  basis for the next recommendations I was

45:4X  just in Warsaw this is a committee

45:4X  reviewing posters by the mrs. Michael

45:4X  Holick in front looking carefully at

45:4X  that posters so I published a paper

45:5X  recently saying why the clinical trial

45:5X  should be based on vitamin D on 2 -?

45:5X  hydroxy Von D because most the trials

46:0X  are based on the assumptions used for

46:0X  pharmaceutical drugs first of all that

46:0X  the trial is a sole source of the agent

46:1X  and second that there's a linear

46:1X  dose-response relationship between the

46:1X  agent and the health outcome

46:1X  neither assumption is valid for vitamin

46:2X  for vitamin D and also it turns out many

46:2X  of the trials do not follow to measure

46:2X  25 hydroxy vitamin D they just you know

46:3X  think you take the average healthy

46:3X  person and so they get a healthy person

46:3X  affect that there's no benefit of more

46:3X  vitamin D here we show that from the

46:4X  grassroots health data set that for

46:4X  people taking any reporting that they're

46:4X  taking any value of oral vitamin D that

46:5X  there's about a 50 nanogram spread plus

46:5X  or minus 15 intagram of the 25 hydroxy

46:5X  vitamin D concentration that's why if

46:5X  you really wanna know what your vitamin

47:0X  E level is you gotta have it measured it

47:0X  turns out that why do we need clinical

47:0X  trials well observational studies could be

47:1X  being using the 25 hydroxy of any

47:1X  concentration as an indent of diet or of

47:1X  UVB exposure it turns out for example

47:2X  that meat consumption increases

47:2X  literally from the from the tropics

47:2X  highest consumption racer and the high

47:2X  latitudes if you have mechanisms you

47:3X  don't know how much how important Von D

47:3X  is in reducing risk the health systems

47:3X  most of clinical trials as a gold

47:3X  standard we're now in the evidence-based

47:3X  medicine

47:3X  era as imperfect as it is but they're

47:4X  trying in Budapest there's a lot of meat

47:4X  being sold and so they get to increase

47:4X  the risk of cancer and alt and

47:5X  Alzheimer's disease but they're getting

47:5X  some vitamin D so it's a bit of a

47:5X  trade-off so anyway we're proposing that

47:5X  all these trials be based on 25 hydroxy

48:0X  Von D including the imaging beforehand

48:0X  choosing the participants give enough

48:0X  item D to raise 5 D levels high

48:0X  measuring ans cetera et cetera

48:1X  now why you've never heard about the

48:1X  whole truth about vitamin D this is from

48:1X  natural news.com well there's the

48:1X  Federal Trade Commission that tells

48:2X  tanning companies they cannot advertise

48:2X  that tanning produces vitamin D big

48:2X  pharma see is that as competition komen

48:3X  Race for the Cure they don't want to

48:3X  cure there they don't want to prevent

48:3X  breast cancer they want to manage for

48:3X  breast cancer the FDA they help sponsor

48:3X  the Institute of Medicine report there's

48:4X  oncologists who make fifty thousand

48:4X  hundred thousand dollars in treating

48:4X  cancer ten dollars a year for vitamin E

48:4X  to prevent cancer no you don't want that

48:5X  and the National Cancer Institute

48:5X  so grassroots well okay I'm a co-author

48:5X  on a book coming out shortly called

49:0X  embrace the Sun mark Sorenson is the

49:0X  primary author and dr. T who spoken here

49:0X  before is doing a very careful text

49:0X  editing Michael Holick wrote the

49:1X  foreword for this this should be

49:1X  available in November or December and

49:1X  you can contact me and we can tell you

49:1X  how to get it now for more information  go to

49:2X  med which has 27 million health

49:2X  publications listed there you can

49:3X  finally access with scholar.google.com

49:4X  who spends all his waking hours making

49:4X  bundy information accessible finding

49:4X  counsel in nevada new society a society in cancer

49:5X  thank you okay great thank you it's

49:5X  really refreshing to hear someone talk

49:5X  about being in the sun is it really good for you

50:0X  we're gonna push a little bit beyond

50:0X  where we would normally try to stop i

50:0X  want to take a couple of questions if we

50:0X  have them and then we need to start then

50:1X  we can continue yeah after the

50:1X  informally so any question i'm for the

50:1X  group here right doesn't heal per day

50:2X  but what are the consequences well the

50:2X  primary consequence of too much of

50:2X  vitamin D is hypercalcemia if you get

50:3X  hypercalcemia you don't feel good and so

50:3X  these people are taking fifty thousand

50:3X  definitely feel fine they do have very

50:4X  high 25 hydroxy Von D concentrations I

50:4X  guess we'll just have to see what  happens

50:4X  it stores though the same 50,000 a year

50:5X  saying but if you took it yeah if you

50:5X  took it once a week or hmm

50:5X  yeah the vitamin E can store in the fat

51:0X  and the muscles the 25 has a short

51:0X  half-life I'm hoping you would ask a

51:0X  question first of all thank you for your

51:1X  contributions to the scientific

51:1X  community second of all so I have my

51:1X  understanding is UVB is the best from 1 -?

51:1X  a.m. to 4 p.m. and what would you

51:2X  recommend like 20 to 25 minutes in the

51:2X  sunlight well more like 10 to – ?

51:2X  and it depends on how much skin you can

51:3X  expose and your skin pigmentation so if

51:3X  you're fair-skinned and mixed pros let's

51:3X  say a young person exposing 10% of his

51:4X  body can maybe make after you 20 or 30 I

51:4X  you per per minute maybe so maybe 25 to

51:4X  15 minutes for a young person it might

51:5X  be enough but if you can expose a

51:5X  quarter of your body that's better you

51:5X  cut down the time there are there are

51:5X  UVB meters out that tell you how much

52:0X  time you has been made thank you I'll

52:0X  check that out okay one more quick okay

52:0X  so that's Daly but if you only get out

52:1X  once a week but you're out for six to

52:1X  ten hours and the half-life is long

52:1X  enough you can get enough that way also

52:1X  correct yeah you can make twenty

52:2X  thousand in a day so and you can store

52:2X  the X and the half-life is two and a

52:2X  half weeks and you can store the excess

52:2X  vitamin D so that would probably do okay

52:3X  that's good do you mind go ahead and ask

52:3X  your question one on one or the one

52:4X  where the people are taking and then

52:4X  they're measuring the dosages about four

52:4X  from the end or so is that published

52:4X  somewhere that seems like a really

52:5X  important okay we'll go ahead why don't

53:0X  you go ahead and finish this one yeah

53:0X  let's complete the evening thank you all

53:0X  for coming we meet the third Thursday of

53:1X  every month   you
