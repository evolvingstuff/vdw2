 **Snips from the very nice artilce** 

* 'taking a 500 mg time-released <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span> supplement every day can have similar cardiovascular benefits as regular exercise in these adults'

* "But the researchers found that <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span> reduced ET-1 vessel constriction as much as  **walking**  for exercise did. "

* "Studies show that, compared to people getting the least <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span>, those getting the most had a dramatic 80% lower risk of heart attack"

* "eight months the <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span> reduced systolic pressure by 4.5 mm Hg and diastolic pressure by 2.8 mm Hg"

* 'And <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span> is fast-acting.  In one study just a single 2,000 mg dose taken by healthy male volunteers reduced arterial stiffness by 10% and platelet aggregation by 35% in just  **six hours** ."

* "It also reduces recovery time.  One study found that it only takes 200 mg twice a day to reduce muscle soreness, improve muscle function, and lower signs of oxidative stress after a 90 minute run"

* 'The best way to get <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span> is from food"

* "The half-life of <span style="color:#F00;">vitamin C</span> is 30 minutes.  So instead of one big dose it's better to take multiple doses during the day to keep your blood levels up"

If you’re elderly, for instance, you may have higher requirements for vitamin C, as aging may inhibit absorption. Smokers may also require more vitamin C due to the increased oxidative stress from cigarette smoke. Signs that you may need more vitamin C include:

* Dry and splitting hair	

* Gingivitis (inflammation of your gums)	

* Bleeding gums

* Rough, dry or scaly skin	

* Decreased wound-healing rate	

* Easy bruising

* Nosebleeds	

* Decreased ability to ward off infection

 **Snips follow** 

* "According to Dr. Andrew Saul, editor of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, if everyone were to take 500 mg of vitamin C per day — the dose required to reach a healthy level of 80 µmol/L — an estimated 216,000 lives could be spared each year."
