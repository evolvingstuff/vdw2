Background: Currently, there is growing evidence that vitamin D plays a role on several tissues including skeletal muscle. Previous studies suggested that vitamin D deficiency is associated with low muscular strength. The objective of this meta-analysis is to summarize the effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength. 

Methods: A systematic research of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength and performed between 1966 and February 2013 has been conducted (Medline, Cochrane Database of Systematics Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, manual review of the literature and congressional abstracts). All forms and doses of vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium supplementation, compared with placebo or control were included. The quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Jadad criteria. 

Results: Out of the 214 potentially relevant articles, 19 RCTs involving 4824 individuals (mean age: 66.0 years) met the inclusion criteria. Studies showed a mean quality score of 3.8/5 points. 

Results revealed a significant positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on global muscle strength with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.096 (95% CI = 0.007-0.184; p = 0.034). No significant between-study heterogeneity was found (Q-value = 23.6; p = 0.21; I2 =19.6%). Regarding the individual type of strength, results showed no significant effect on vitamin D supplementation on grip strength (SMD: 0.062, p = 0.264), but a significant positive effect on  **lower limb muscle strength**  (SMD: 0.169, p = 0.03).

Conclusions: Based on the studies included in this meta-analysis, vitamin D supplementation has a positive impact on global muscle strength, and more especially, on lower limb muscle strength. 

 **Key messages**  

* Vitamin D supplements increase muscle strength mainly at the lower limb. However, the exact effective dose needs to be assessed.

* People with affection including low muscular strength, such as sarcopenia, should be supplemented with vitamin D.
