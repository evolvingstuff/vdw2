#### What Kind of Breast Cancer Research Could Make the Biggest Impact?

 **[GrassrootsHealth](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/kind-breast-cancer-research-make-biggest-impact/?utm_source=newsletter-main&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsletters)** 

"According to a [study published in 2015](https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001DDEQSrBpGRx6MsdINpGqUD2ZNd1I7mIralYhFwchSwT5b3tgLObjuLSevtLj1tBHdeXy58maeUaHuSDBkc3R7ko01NoyqjJk8axjwth8HurGKyZaF9D94VWGz6kkXGt0tgksZrO3eVBjL9fiEWc-JBrPj0p1_Jdm3G3PAsC77HUOkXI6UGxGfIHU9Bijsbyf4fZu3sG0luGRpb8pRV7rMpysRpQ4kklFNH9K8RbR8-xDW80zfIxmgIbXmZDflpP8YKVWejgPkcVfCX_ElhEUqgJkoH9uEBZeXPNKeyQ86esd_zE5oSYZeOTWSZX54zwYYVq4P8r3_sMu8pJnCUf0Dw==&c=kXDxhJL6mXpnpO8fnh-5035J8IF4C41gGk6oibzQC303prkA5Z6qzg==&ch=1FgIYxjRqmOR--4EcG8lxdYED5ZkfPwanpeNCLgRgWM76SPC29g4Zw==), among 1,000 women who start screening at age 50 and are screened for 20 years, 2 to 3 will avoid dying from breast cancer and 200 women will have at least one false positive test, 30 will undergo a biopsy, 3 will be diagnosed with an interval cancer, and breast cancer will be over-diagnosed in 15. The rough estimate of the financial impact of excess testing and overtreatment following a false positive is close to  **4.1 billion dollars each year.** "

"Meanwhile, getting everyone’s vitamin D level up to at least 40-60 ng/ml, assuming an 80% reduced risk of incidence, is a safe and cost-effective intervention that could result in around 225,000 people who would be saved the trauma of breast cancer this year – both the disease itself and the horrific treatment."

 **20 minute analysis of cost of Vitamin D needed to get women in BC age-range in the United States to >40 ng** 

Guess that 50% of all women would be in the age-range to get Breast Cancer

Biweekly 50,000 IU of vitamin D cost $5 per year (non-obese) 70%

Weekly 50,000 IU of Vitamin D costs $10 per year (obese) 30%

so  70% @ $5 + 30% @10) = $6.50 per woman treated

times 75 million women = **$500 million/year** 

 **Current cost of mamograms** 

Direct  cost: $150 each X 20 million women annually =  **$3 billion** 

Direct  cost:   **$4.1 billion.** "

Total cost  **$7.1 billion** 

 **Guess that mamogram rate can be cut in half by having > 40 ng of vitamin D** 

Costs savings by reduced mamograms = $3.5 Billion

Cost of vitamin D = $500 million

 **Net Cost savings = $3 billion**
