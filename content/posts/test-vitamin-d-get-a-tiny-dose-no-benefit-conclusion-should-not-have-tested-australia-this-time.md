Objective To undertake an assessment of the health, financial and environmental impacts of a well-recognised example of low-value care; inappropriate vitamin D testing. 

Design Combination of systematic literature search, analysis of routinely collected healthcare data and environmental analysis.

Setting Australian healthcare system.

Participants Population of Australia.

Outcome measures We took a sustainability approach, measuring the health, financial and environmental impacts of a specific healthcare activity. Unnecessary vitamin D testing rates were estimated from best available published literature; by definition, these provide no gain in health outcomes (in contrast to appropriate/necessary tests). Australian population-based test numbers and healthcare costs were obtained from Medicare for vitamin D pathology services. Carbon emissions in kg CO2e were estimated using data from our previous study of the carbon footprint of common pathology tests. We distinguished between tests ordered as the primary test and those ordered as an add-on to other tests, as many may be done in conjunction with other tests. We conducted base case (8% being the primary reason for the blood test) and sensitivity (12% primary test) analyses.

Results There were a total of 4 457 657 Medicare- funded vitamin D tests in 2020, on average one test for every six Australians, an 11.8% increase from the mean 2018-2019 total. From our literature review, 76.5% of Australia's vitamin D tests provide no net health benefit, equating to 3 410 108 unnecessary tests in 2020. Total costs of unnecessary tests to Medicare amounted to >$A87 000 000. The 2020 carbon footprint of unnecessary vitamin D tests was 28 576 kg (base case) and 42 012 kg (sensitivity) CO2e, equivalent to driving ~160 000 - 230 000 km in a standard passenger car.

Conclusions Unnecessary vitamin D testing contributes to avoidable CO2e emissions and healthcare costs. While the footprint of this example is relatively small, the potential to realise environmental cobenefits by reducing low-value care more broadly is significant.

 **If feel better:  
3) start maintenance dose (bi-weekly 50,000 IU)

#### Rapid response: Vitamin D testing should be aimed at raising vitamin D levels to optimal values (Dr. Grant)

https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/8/e056997

The article by Breth-Petersen et al. 1 claimed that 77% of Australia’s vitamin D tests provide no health benefit. The primary basis for this claim was an article from Australia in which bone-centric vitamin D values <50 nmol/L were considered the sole basis for health benefits 2. The second reference in that paper was by Pludowski et al. 3. It stated: The bone-centric guidelines recommend a target 25(OH)D concentration of 20 ng/mL (50nmol/L), and age-dependent daily vitamin D doses of 400-800 IU. The guidelines focused on pleiotropic effects of vitamin D recommend a target 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), and age-, body weight-, disease-status, and ethnicity dependent vitamin D doses ranging between 400 and 2000 IU/day. 

Certainly pleiotropic effects of vitamin D are important health effects. Pleiotropic effects are those involving the hormonal metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, binding to vitamin D receptors linked to chromosomes in nearly every cell in the body, thereby affecting gene expression. 

A study involving 30 adults found that supplementation with 600, 4,000 or 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for 6 months resulted in 162, 320 and 1289 genes up- or down-regulated in the participants’ white blood cells, respectively 4. It should be noted that the health benefits are usually better determined from observational studies rather than randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Observational studies can examine health outcomes over a large range of vitamin D levels. 

The main problems with RCTs is that they generally 

* enroll participants with high vitamin D levels, 

* give relatively low vitamin D doses, and 

* analyze results only in terms of intention to treat 5. 

As a result, most major vitamin D RCTs failed to find benefits of vitamin D supplementation. However, when the results of RCTs are analyzed with respect to achieved vitamin D level, significant benefits can be found. A good example is the D2d study using vitamin D3 supplementation of 4000 IU/d regarding progression from prediabetes to diabetes 6. No significant benefit was found for intention to treat, but a 25% (95% confidence interval, 18-32%) reduction was found for each vitamin D level increase by 25 nmol/L from 75 nmol to >125 nmol/L in the treatment arm. Here are a few examples of health benefits for higher vitamin D levels: 

Significant reductions in incidence and death from many types of cancer for vitamin D levels up to at least 100 nmol/L 7 8. Significant reduction in myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality rate for vitamin D level >75 nmol/L compared to <50 nmol/L 9. Significant reduction in incidence of COVID-19 for vitamin D level >75 nmol/L compared to <50 nmol/L 10. A better criterion for the goal of vitamin D testing would be to help patients achieve optimal health. The general finding in a recent review is that optimal vitamin D levels to support health and wellbeing are above 75 nmol/L for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality rate, whereas the thresholds for several other outcomes appear to range up to 100 to 125 nmol/L 11.
