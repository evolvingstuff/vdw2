#### [Mailchimp Shuts Down GreenMedInfo's Newsletter for "Anti-Vaccine" Content](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/mailchimp-shuts-down-greenmedinfos-newsletter-anti-vaccine-content)

* “Mailchimp, one of the world’s most widely used email marketing services, and  **CDC Foundation partner** , has shut down the account of GreenMedInfo.com for “anti-vaccine content," establishing itself as a publisher and censor, and not a politically neutral service provider.”

 **Update June 22, 2019** 

They have a new email provider, but were unable to get current list from MailChimp, 

They ended up using an old list which had 100,000 fewer subscibers
