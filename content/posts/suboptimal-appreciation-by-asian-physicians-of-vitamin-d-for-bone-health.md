BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2010, 11:248doi:10.1186/1471-2474-11-248

Published: 	26 October 2010

Background

Osteoporosis treatment guidelines recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation for both prevention as well as treatment, however, compliance with these guidelines is often unsatisfactory. This study investigated the opinion of Asian physicians and Asian patients regarding vitamin D and calcium and patients' use of both.

Methods

Physicians selected from Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines, Korea and Singapore were asked to grade the significance of vitamin D and calcium in the treatment of osteoporosis and their patients' use of these supplements. In addition, physicians recruited seven eligible osteoporotic women to answer a questionnaire to determine their use of vitamin D and calcium, and their attitudes and beliefs regarding these supplements.

Results

In total, 237 physicians and 1463 osteoporosis patients completed the questionnaire. The results revealed that 

22% of physicians in Malaysia, 

12% in Taiwan, 

72% in the Philippines, 

50% in Korea and 

24% in Singapore rated the importance of vitamin D supplementation as being extremely important. 

For calcium, 27% of physicians in Malaysia, 30% in Taiwan, 80% in the Philippines, 50% in Korea and 38% in Singapore rated the importance as being extremely important. 

Forty-three percent of patients in Malaysia, 38% in Taiwan, 73% in the Philippines, 35% in Korea and 39% in Singapore rated the importance of vitamin D as being extremely important. 

For calcium, 69% of patients in Malaysia, 58% in Taiwan, 90% in the Philippines, 70% in Korea and 55% in Singapore rated the importance as being extremely important. In addition, results of the patient questionnaire revealed that only a very small number regularly took both supplements. In addition, the results indicated that, with the exception of patients from the Philippines, the majority of patients had no or infrequent discussion with their physician about vitamin D and calcium.

Conclusions

There is generally  **suboptimal appreciation by both physicians and patients of the importance of vitamin D and calcium for maintenance of bone health**  as reflected in the low number of patients who reported regularly taking these supplements. Recognition of this problem should translate to appropriate action to improve education for both physicians and patients, with a goal to increase use of these supplements among Asian patients with osteoporosis.

Background

The effect of osteoporosis on public health and the resultant financial burden are considerable <sup>[1,2]</sup>. Until recently the majority of epidemiological studies on osteoporosis have been performed in Western Caucasian populations in which  the  incidence  of  osteoporosis  is  high  <sup>[2]</sup>;  but  as  Asian  populations become   more   aged,   similar   phenomena   are   being   observed   with   the incidence  of  osteoporosis  increasing  <span>[3-5]</span>.  Hip  fracture  is  a  significant public health problem today in Asia as in Europe and North America. It has been projected that by the year 2050, 50% of hip fractures worldwide will occur in Asia <span>[6-8]</span>. Although the incidence of hip fracture is generally lower in Asia <sup>[9]</sup>, there is variation in the rate based on ethnicity and geographic location <sup>[5,10]</sup>. The underlying mortality rate and functional outcomes  are very  similar  to  those  observed  in  Western  Caucasian  populations  <span>[10-13]</span>. Compounding the problem of increased incidence of osteoporosis in Asian populations is the findings from epidemiological studies that have identified a high incidence of vitamin D inadequacy<sup>[14,15]</sup>. Vitamin D deficiency has also been identified in postmenopausal women in Eastern Asia <sup>[16]</sup>.

Effective therapies are now available for the treatment of osteoporosis, most notably   the   oral   bisphosphonates,   currently   the   most   commonly   used therapeutic modality for this disease <sup>[17]</sup>. In addition to the various active anti-osteoporosis agents, there is clear evidence that adequate vitamin D and calcium  intake  also  play  significant  roles  in  ameliorating  the  severity  of osteoporosis  and  are  necessary  for  optimal  response  to  pharmacologic intervention <sup>[18,19]</sup>. Vitamin D and calcium can be obtained directly via the diet or by supplementation <sup>[20,21]</sup>. A chronically low intake of calcium in the diet decreases bone mass and leads to an increased risk of osteoporosis and    bone    fracture   <sup>[22]</sup>.    Calcium   supplementation    alone   has    been demonstrated  to  increase  bone  mineral  density  and  to  decrease  the  rate  of fracture    in    postmenopausal    women    <span>[23-27]</span>.    Likewise,    addition    of supplemental vitamin D to the diet has also been shown to reduce fracture rate  in  postmenopausal  women  <sup>[28,29]</sup>.  Combination  of  both  calcium  and vitamin  D  supplementation  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the  rate  of  bone mineral density loss and fracture rates <span>[30-33]</span>. Consequently, most clinical guidelines  recommend  supplementation  with  calcium  and  vitamin  D  to optimize the efficacy of pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis <sup>[20,34]</sup>. Guidelines regarding the recommended daily calcium intake vary according to gender, life stage, and also from region to region <sup>[35,36]</sup>. However, the present recommended minimum daily calcium intake for adults ranges from 1000–1300mg <span>[35-37]</span>. Even though calcium is relatively common <sup>[35,38]</sup> in   the   diet,   supplementation   is   frequently   necessary.   Intake   is   often insufficient due to religious or dietary restrictions, lactose intolerance, etc. It is  recommended  that  if  dietary intake  of calcium-rich  foods  is  inadequate, supplements  containing  elemental  calcium  (calcium  citrate  and  calcium carbonate)  should  be  taken  <sup>[35]</sup>.  It  should  be  noted  that  commonly  used multivitamin supplements often do not contain sufficient calcium to make up for deficiency in the diet <sup>[35]</sup>.

Increasing calcium intake alone is insufficient for adequate maintenance of bone  mass.  Sufficient  vitamin  D  is  required  for  optimal  intestinal  calcium absorption  <sup>[39]</sup>.  Calcium  absorption  decreases  as  25-hydroxyvitamin  D (25(OH)D)   levels   decrease,   leading   to   bone   loss   <sup>[40]</sup>.   As   a   result, persistently low levels of vitamin D are linked to reduced bone density and an increase in the risk of fragility fracture <sup>[41]</sup>. At present, the US National Institutes of Health Institute of Medicine recommends a daily intake of 400 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) for women ages 51–70 years, increasing to 600 IU for women over age 70 <sup>[36]</sup>. The Scientific Committee for Food of the Commission of the European Community presently recommends 400 IU   daily   for   those   65   years   of   age   or   older   <sup>[42]</sup>.   Despite   the recommendations   of   these   bodies,   many   women   being   treated   for osteoporosis do not regularly take sufficient vitamin D supplementation and have  low  serum  25(OH)D  levels,  the  clinical  parameter  used  to  measure vitamin  D  status  <sup>[29,43]</sup>.  Unlike  calcium,  which  is  readily  available  in  a number of dietary sources, dietary sources of vitamin D are more restricted (oily  fish,  some  fortified  foods,  and  egg  yolks).  Apart  from  these  limited dietary sources of vitamin D, the alternative source is exposure to sunlight. However, exposure to sunlight is often limited for adequate synthesis due to lack of sunlight in Northerly latitudes or due to the avoidance of exposure for cosmetic / cultural reasons and concerns about the risk of skin cancer. As a result, most people are likely to require supplementation to be vitamin D replete <span>[44-46]</span>. Although vitamin D is necessary for regulation of calcium metabolism and  maintenance  of  normal  bone  health,  a  significant  body of evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency/inadequacy is common <sup>[47,48]</sup>. Notably, low levels of vitamin D are frequently observed in older females, the  population  most  affected  by  osteoporosis  <span>[49-51]</span>.  Despite  the  clear evidence for vitamin D inadequacy playing an important role in aggravating osteoporosis,  this  involvement  is  not  widely  understood,  recognized  or appreciated by physicians as well as patients <sup>[39,45,52,53]</sup>.

A   recent   study,   Incidence   and   Characterization   of   inadequate   clinical Responders  in  Osteoporosis  (ICARO),  observed  that  lack  of  compliance with  treatment  and  insufficient  supplementation  of  calcium and  vitamin  D have a major impact on response to therapy in osteoporosis <sup>[54]</sup>. It has been reported  in  a  recently  conducted  questionnaire  that  while  patients  are knowledgeable about the role of calcium as a bone-building agent, but they are less knowledgeable about the role of vitamin D in this process <sup>[55]</sup>. This study  and  others  have  highlighted  the  lack  of  compliance  among  patients who  were  aware  of  the  importance  of  both  vitamin  D  and  calcium  <sup>[34]</sup>. Although  a  number  of  European  studies  have  described  differences  in attitudes  and  beliefs  between  physicians  and  their  patients  on  matters regarding osteoporosis, current therapies, and compliance <sup>[56,57]</sup>, few have explored  these  issues  in  Asian  populations.  The  goal  of  this  study  was  to measure physicians’ and patients’ attitudes and beliefs regarding vitamin D and  calcium  and  their  importance  in  the  treatment  of  osteoporosis  and  to detail  perception  and  actual  compliance  with  guidelines  regarding  these supplements in Asian populations.

## Methods

Questionnaire design.

Throughout 2006, a total of 237 randomly selected physicians in Malaysia (n=37), Taiwan (n=50), the Philippines (n=50), Korea (n=50) and Singapore (n=50)  were  requested  to  enroll  seven  consecutive  eligible  osteoporosis patients   who   were   willing   to   take   part   in   a   telephone   questionnaire concerning  the  significance  of  vitamin  D  and  calcium  to  osteoporosis therapy. As it can be complex to enroll physicians to answer a questionnaire of this nature, a sample of 50 physicians per country was considered to be a reasonable  minimum  number  to  acquire  results  with  a  good  degree  of statistical robustness. The physicians were requested to enroll the first seven osteoporosis patients who met the inclusion criteria. This was thought to be an   acceptable   undertaking   for   the   physicians   and   would   provide   the opportunity to analyze patient results by sub-groups. This method was used to  help  randomize  the  mix  of  subjects  enrolled,  hence  ensuring  that  the participating  subjects  were  nationally  representative  for  the  enrollment criteria.  Statistical  power  was  not  provided  by  the  physician  or  patient sample  sizes,  and  these  population  sizes  were  used  by  the  questionnaire designers’  previous  knowledge  of  what  sample  sizes  are  achievable  and reasonable,  given  the  goals  and  budget  of  the  study.  Physicians  included such   specialties   as   General   Medicine,   Internal   Medicine,   Gynecology, Orthopedic Surgery, Geriatrics, and Rheumatology, specialties that are most likely to treat patients with osteoporosis.

A  convenient  sample  of  physicians  was  chosen  from  physician  licensure databases   from   each   country   participating   in   the   study.   Only   post-menopausal  women  ?  50  years  of  age  who  had  been  diagnosed  with  and were  being  treated  for  osteoporosis  were  eligible  to  participate.  Exclusion criteria for both physicians and patients included participation in any market research    involving    women’s    health    during    the    3-months    prior    to participating in the questionnaire and / or having a relative who is employed by a pharmaceutical company.

The questionnaire was translated to the local language and validated in the countries  that  the  study was  undertaken. The  questionnaire  was  conducted by a skilled local contractor.

This survey was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines  for  good  clinical  practice.  Patients  were  informed  about  the survey by their physician and voluntarily contacted the survey administrators to  participate.  Patients  were  instructed  about  the  nature  of  the  survey  and gave  their  consent  to  participate.  Since  participation  did  not  affect  patient care,  Institutional  Review  Board  and  ethics  committee  review  was  not required. Physician and patient response data were collected, managed, and secured by Research International Healthcare, which has defined procedures to maintain the security and confidentiality of the data.

It  was  determined  that  General  practitioners  should  see  a  minimum  of  10 patients with osteoporosis each month, whereas specialists were required to see a minimum of 15 osteoporosis patients each month. However, it should be  noted  that  these  enrollment  criteria  were  ascertained  by  self  reporting, and  no  further  validation  was  performed.  To  make  certain  of  an  adequate level of experience, physicians were required to have been in practice for ? 3 years  or  <  30  years,  to  guarantee  a  good  level  of  experience,  and  to  be current  with  recent  treatment  practices.  Physicians'  participation  in  the questionnaire  occurred  after  complete  enrollment  of  the  minimum  seven suitable patients and only once those patient questionnaires were finalized in order   to   minimize   the   risk   that   physicians   might   inadvertently   or purposefully  influence  patient  answers.  Nonetheless,  it  is  possible  that patients may have obtained some knowledge of the subject matter from the physician  at the time  of their  enrollment. Physicians had no knowledge of the precise nature of the patient questionnaires or aims of the study prior to the  patient  interviews;  hence  it  would  have  been  unlikely  that  physicians could  influence  patient  responses  even  if  desired.  However,  the  authors concede  that  they  cannot  guarantee  that  previous  interactions  between patient  and  physician  prior  to  interviewing  of  either  party  did  not  impact responses. During the course of the study, however, a number of physicians did not enroll the required 7 patients, and consequently the patient number criterion (400 per country) was relaxed so that the study could be concluded. The  final  number  of  completed  patient  questionnaires  was  as  follows: Malaysia (n=251), Taiwan (n=218), the Philippines (n=194), Korea (n=400) and Singapore (n=400).

The protocol for the questionnaire involved the use of telephone interviews for  both  physicians  and  patients  using  a  16-question  questionnaire.  The questionnaire for both patient (Additional file 1) and physician (Additional file 2) involved the use of open-ended response items, closed-end questions, and scale items (scale from 1–10, where 1 = not important at all, and 10 = extremely important).

Some of the major questions that this questionnaire was intended to answer were:

1. Are  physicians  and  patients  knowledgeable  regarding  the importance  of vitamin D and calcium in the management of osteoporosis?

2.  Are  osteoporosis  patients  compliant  with  their  recommended  dosing regimens for supplementary vitamin D and calcium?

3. Are physicians aware of their osteoporosis patients’ willingness to follow recommended dosing regimens for supplementary vitamin D and calcium?

4. How much information did patients receive regarding the need for vitamin D and calcium in the treatment of osteoporosis?

To ensure that the data collected was valid, quality checks were performed to  ensure  that  answers  complied  with  the  basic  rules  of  the  questionnaire such as no multi-response answers for single-response questions. Although data were not checked to ensure that the subjects responded reliably to all questions, there are no grounds to assume that subjects did not respond to the best of their knowledge and ability. The questionnaires were designed to collect   demographic   data   and   obtain   answers   regarding   the   subjects’ attitudes and beliefs in regards to vitamin D and calcium in the treatment of osteoporosis.

## Statistical/data analysis

Statistical analysis was performed utilizing a Microsoft Excel-based analysis tool. A standard two-tailed tests set at p < 0.01 (99% level of significance) were  employed  to  test  data  between  countries.  We  determined  whether percentages or mean scores were appropriate. In the case of ordinal scales, statistical analyses were performed on differences between percentages for individual   answer   options,   rather   than   on   differences   between   means. Differences were often performed between percentages rather than means as certain scales are not linear and hence a mean score is irrelevant. Analyses were only performed between countries.

## Results

Physician and patient characteristics:

Two  hundred  and  thirty  seven  physicians  participated:  37  from  Malaysia, and   50   each   from   Taiwan,   the   Philippines,   Korea   and   Singapore; demographics are shown in Table-1. 1463 osteoporosis patients (251, 218, 194,  400  and  400  from  Malaysia,  Taiwan,  the  Philippines,  Korea  and Singapore respectively) participated in the questionnaire; demographic data are shown in Table 2.

Although  each  physician  was  requested  to  enroll  a  minimum  of  seven patients,  the  enrollment  target  was  not  met  in  Malaysia,  Taiwan  and  the Philippines.    Consequently    numbers    required    to    achieve    statistically significant differences in attitude and belief between Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines and other countries is slightly higher than it would have been if enrollment targets had been met. For example if 50% of patients in Korea (n = 400) replied ‘yes’ to a question, whereas 60% replied ‘yes’ in Singapore (n = 400) and Taiwan (n = 218), Korea and Singapore would differ at a level of  99%  confidence  whereas  Korea  and  Taiwan  would  not  (though  they would at a level of at least 95%). The physicians were on average 45.5 years old  and  had  been  practicing  for  a  mean  of  14.8  years.  There  were  no statistically significant  differences  between  countries  with  respect  to  mean physician age or mean practice experience. Most were general practitioners or orthopedists. Mean patient age was 63.4 years, and mean length of time since  osteoporosis  diagnosis  was  2.6  years.  There  were  no  statistically significant differences between countries with respect to mean patient age or mean length of time since osteoporosis diagnosis.

## Physician  and  patient  awareness  of  the  importance  of  vitamin  D  and calcium in the management of osteoporosis:

In response to the question on the importance of vitamin D and calcium in management  of  osteoporosis,  using  a  scale  of  1  to  10  (where  1  =  not important at all; and 10 = extremely important), vitamin D was thought to be of  high  importance  (>8)  in  the  management  of  osteoporosis  by  72%  of physicians  in  the  Philippines  compared  with  22%  in  Malaysia,  12%  in Taiwan, 50% in Korea and 24% in Singapore (Figure 1). Calcium was also thought to be of high importance (>8) in the management of osteoporosis by 80% of physicians in the Philippines compared with 27% in Malaysia, 12% in  Taiwan,  50%  in  Korea  and  38%  in  Singapore  (Figure  1).  Within  each country, with the exception of Korea, physicians gave more importance to calcium than to vitamin D.

In response to the same question regarding the importance of vitamin D and calcium   in   the   management   of   osteoporosis,   patients,   like   physicians, generally considered calcium to be more important than vitamin D (Figure 2). Vitamin D was thought to be of high importance (>8) in the management of osteoporosis by 73% of patients in the Philippines compared with 43% in Malaysia, 38% in Taiwan, 35% in Korea and 39% in Singapore (Figure 2). Calcium was thought to be of high importance (>8) in the management of osteoporosis  by 90% of  patients  in  the  Philippines  compared  with  69%  in Malaysia, 58% in Taiwan, 70% in Korea and 55% in Singapore

## Compliance with of calcium and vitamin D supplements and physician and patient discussion regarding supplements:

### Malaysia

In Malaysia, only 13% of patients reported taking both calcium and vitamin D supplements either separately (6%) or together in a combination pill (7%) (Figure-3). However, 83% of those patients who take supplements reported taking supplements recommended by their doctor daily, while 3% reported taking  supplements  most  days  (Figure  4).  Fifty-one  percent  of  physicians estimated   that   their   patients   were   fully   compliant   and   took   their supplements,   which   included   vitamin   D,   daily,   while   27%   estimated compliance at most days (Figure 5). 84% and 51% of the patients reported that  their  physician  never  discussed  the  importance  of  vitamin  D  and calcium,  respectively,  in  relation  to  the  management  of  their  osteoporosis (Figure 6a and b).

### Taiwan

Thirty  percent  of  patients  in  Taiwan  reported  taking  both  calcium  and vitamin D supplements either separately (8%) or together in a combination pill (22%) (Figure 3), and of those, 91% took the supplements on a regular basis  (83%  every  day;  9%  most  days)  (Figure  4).  Eighteen  percent  of physicians estimated that their patients were fully compliant and took their supplements  daily, while 16% estimated  compliance on  most  days  (Figure 5). The majority of patients in Taiwan (75%) reported that they had had no (46%) or infrequent (29%) discussions with their physicians about vitamin D,  and  almost  50%  of  patients  reported,  no  (16%)  or  infrequent  (33%) discussions with their physicians about calcium (Figure 6 a and b).

### The Philippines

In the Philippines, 55% of patients reported taking both calcium and vitamin D  supplements  either  separately  (45%)  or  together  in  a  combination  pill (10%)  (Figure  3),  with  98%  taking  supplements  on  a  regular  basis  (93% every  day;  5%  most  days)  (Figure  4).  Eighty-four  percent  of  physicians estimated that their patients were fully compliant and took their supplements daily,  while  6%  estimated  compliance  on  most  days  (Figure  5).  Less  than half of the patients reported that they had had no (16%) or infrequent (25%) discussions with their physicians regarding vitamin D, while 3% reported no and 16% reported infrequent discussions about calcium (Figure 6 a and b).

### Korea

In  Korea,  23%  of  patients  reported  taking  both  calcium  and  vitamin  D supplements either separately (9%) or together in a combination pill (14%) (Figure 3), with 81% taking supplements on a regular basis (73% every day; 8%  on  most  days)  (Figure  4).  Physicians  reported  that  only  14%  of  their patients take their supplements daily and 12% take their supplements most days (Figure 5). The majority of patients in Korea (75%) reported that they had  had  no  (55%)  or  infrequent  (24%)  discussions  with  their  physicians about vitamin D and 51% of patients reported, no (17%) or infrequent (34%) discussions with their physicians about calcium (Figure-6 a and b)

### Singapore

In Singapore, 69% of patients reported taking both calcium and vitamin D supplements either separately (46%) or together in a combination pill (23%) (Figure 3), with 91% of those doing so on a regular basis (76% every day; 15% on most days) (Figure 4). Physicians reported that 42% of their patients take their supplements daily, while 50% take their supplements on most days (Figure 5). The majority of patients in Singapore (86%) reported that they had  had  no  (55%)  or  infrequent  (31%)  discussions  with  their  physicians regarding vitamin D, and 76% of patients reported, no (40%) or infrequent (36%) discussions with their physicians about calcium (Figure 6 a and b).

## Discussion

Supplementation of dietary calcium and vitamin D plays a critical role in the therapy  of  osteoporosis  <sup>[20,53]</sup>.  Given  the  essential  role  of  vitamin  D  in calcium absorption from the gut, any insufficiency in vitamin D negatively impacts  calcium  metabolism  irrespective  of  intake  of  sufficient  dietary  or supplemental calcium <sup>[40,45]</sup>. Therefore insufficient and sporadic intake of vitamin  D  can  lead  to  chronic  vitamin  D  deficiency/insufficiency,  thereby reducing the effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment <sup>[40,45]</sup>.

The  outcome  of  this  study  has  demonstrated  that  physicians  in  Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore had a poor appreciation of the importance of vitamin D and calcium for bone health, physicians in Korea had a fair appreciation of it and physicians in the Philippines had a heightened appreciation of the importance   of   both   for   bone   health.   In   general,   there   was   a   good understanding of the importance of vitamin D and calcium among patients from these  five  countries,  although  it  was  evident  that  patients  considered calcium to be more important than vitamin D.

Given the poor understanding among physicians and patients that vitamin D is  central  to  maintenance  of  bone  health;  it  is  not  surprising  that  the percentage of patients who frequently took vitamin D supplements was low. In  Malaysia, Taiwan and  Korea, less than  30% of  patients  reported taking vitamin D and calcium.

Although   the   questionnaire   highlighted,   with   the   exception   of   the Philippines,  a  poor  awareness  among  physicians  of  the  importance  of calcium  and,  in  particular,  vitamin  D  in  osteoporosis  management,  this resulted in poor advice for patients, as at least 50% of patients in Malaysia, Taiwan,  Korea,  and  Singapore  reported  no  or  infrequent  discussions  with their   physicians   regarding   the   importance   of   vitamin   D   and   calcium supplementation.

Of  these  five  countries,  the  Philippines  clearly  stood  out  as  the  country where  both  physicians  and  patients  understood  the  importance  of  both vitamin   D   and   calcium   in   the   management   of   osteoporosis.   This understanding resulted in a high compliance among patients for supplements to be taken with osteoporosis treatments.

This study provides additional evidence that in Asian countries compliance with  treatment  guidelines  is  not  optimal  among  osteoporosis  patients  that may  be  at  high  risk  for  vitamin  D  insufficiency/deficiency  <span>[58-60]</span>.  The prevalence  of  vitamin  D  insufficiency  is  high  in  South  Asian  countries <sup>[14,16]</sup> and although it is highly unlikely that poor advice from physicians regarding vitamin D supplementation is the sole cause, it is possible that this may be a contributory factor.

In   accordance   with   a   number   of   other   studies,   this   study   clearly demonstrates that physicians generally misjudge their patients’ compliance with their osteoporosis treatment and their readiness to adhere to treatment directions.   The   largest   discrepancies   between   physician   estimates   and patient-reported  compliance  were  in  Taiwan  and  Korea,  where  83%  and 73%  of  patients  who  take  supplements,  respectively,  state  that  they  take them  every  day,  whereas  only  18%  of  physicians  in  Taiwan  and  14%  in Korea  estimated  their  patients  were  fully  compliant.  In  Malaysia  these figures  were  83% of patients  vs. 51% of physicians;  in  Singapore  76% of patients vs. 42% of physicians. The exception was in the Philippines, where 93% of patients and 84% of physicians reported compliance.

It is possible that this effect is because physicians are hesitant to state that their patients take their vitamin D and calcium supplements every day. By combining the responses for compliance most days with compliance every day, then the results are more similar (86% of patients vs. 78% of physicians in Malaysia; 98% vs. 90% in the Philippines; 91% vs. 92% in Singapore); however,  even  after  combining  these  responses,  the  difference  between patient-   and   physician-reported   compliance   in   Taiwan   and  Korea   was significant.

Responses  to  the  questionnaire  by  patients  about  how  the  frequently  their physicians discussed vitamin D and calcium with them revealed that, in each case, half of the patients reported that fewer discussions occurred than their physicians   reported   (data   not   shown).   Interestingly,   results   from   the Philippines   demonstrated   the   greatest   agreement   between   patient   and physicians of all the countries studied in the region. In addition, patients in the Philippines not only reported discussions with physicians at a frequency similar  to  that  reported  by  the  physicians  themselves,  the  patients  also reported  the  occurrence  of  discussions  about  vitamin  D  and  calcium  at  a higher level than the other countries studied. In all countries studied, patients reported that calcium was discussed more frequently than vitamin D.

It is generally accepted that patients have improved health outcomes when they are better informed and are involved their treatment <sup>[61]</sup>. The patients’ compliance  with  treatment  is  improved  when  the  reason  for  treatment  is explained  in  combination  with  details  of  the  potential  effectiveness  of  the therapies <sup>[61]</sup>.

The  findings  from  this  study  advocate  that  there  is  a  need  to  enhance patients' and physicians' communication regarding the importance of vitamin D   and   calcium   supplementation   in   treating    osteoporosis.   Evidence supporting this conclusion can be observed clearly in the study findings from the  Philippines,  where  there  was  the  best  patient-reported  communication from physicians regarding vitamin D and calcium. This led to an increased understanding of the importance of vitamin D and calcium in the treatment of  osteoporosis  and  increased  patient  compliance  for  both  supplementary vitamin D and calcium.

Although a lack of information may lead to a lack of compliance in addition to a lack of understanding, compliance may also be particularly low among elderly  osteoporosis  patients  <sup>[62]</sup>.  It  has  been  reported  that  two-thirds  of aged  patients  with  hip  fracture  who  were  recruited  into  a  postsurgical follow-up  program  had  low  levels  of  vitamin  D.  Even  after  consultation explaining  the  necessity  of  calcium  and  vitamin  D  supplementation  in osteoporosis therapy, the majority of these patients were still not compliant with the recommended guidelines 3 months after discharge from hospital55. A potential reason for this observation may be declining compliance as the number of medications increases, and older patients frequently take several medications to treat a range of comorbidities <sup>[61,63,64]</sup>. The average age of the patients in our study was 63.4 years.

## Limitations:

The  degree  to  which  these  results  are  applicable  to  the  entire  Asian population  is  unclear.  Although  the  questionnaire  was  completed  by  a relatively large number of patients and physicians, care must be used when applying  the  results  to  the  entire  Asian  population,  since  participating physicians were chosen from among specific specialty databases, instead of randomly selected from the entire physician population in Malaysia, Taiwan, the  Philippines,  Korea  and  Singapore.  This  study  utilized  patients’  self- reporting of their knowledge of, use of and compliance with vitamin D and calcium.  It  is  frequently  the  case  that  self-reporting  of  compliance  has  a tendency to  be  elevated.  Another  possible  limitation  of  this  study was  the inability   to   determine   baseline   beliefs   regarding   the   severity   and/or perceived   susceptibility   related   to   osteoporosis.   Despite   these   possible limitations,   the   results   are   in   agreement   with   other   reports27,46–48    and underscore the importance of improving the management of osteoporosis by increasing patient and physician understanding of the importance of vitamin D and calcium in maintaining bone health.

## Conclusions

The effect of therapies for osteoporosis can be maximized by the addition of supplementary vitamin D and calcium to the diet. It appears that physicians and patients, with the notable exception of the Philippines, lack knowledge of  the  potential  benefits  of  calcium  and  vitamin  D  supplementation,  and consequently,  compliance  with  the  dosing  regimen  was  observed  to  be insufficient.  Although  the  insidious  nature  of  this  disease,  the  paucity  of immediate perceptible benefit and an inadequate patient motivation may be reasons  to  explain  reduced  compliance,  this  questionnaire  underlines  the need to improve the way this information is communicated to patients and physicians, to define more effective educational and behavioral involvement, and  to  design  additional  studies  to  identify  the  underlying  reasons  for  the disparities  between  the  recognized  benefits  of  supplementary  calcium  and vitamin D and the low compliance with these by osteoporosis patients.
