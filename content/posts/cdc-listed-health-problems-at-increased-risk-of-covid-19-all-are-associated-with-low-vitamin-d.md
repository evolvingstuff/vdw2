 **Note: CDC does not mention the risk factors for COVID-19 which cannot, without Vitamin D, be changed** 

 **Age** 

* Reduced Vitamin D from gut

* Reduced Vitamin generated by the sun

* Reduced vitamin D activation by some health problems (Diabetes, etc)

* Increased Vitamin D consumption by some health problems

 **Dark Skin**
