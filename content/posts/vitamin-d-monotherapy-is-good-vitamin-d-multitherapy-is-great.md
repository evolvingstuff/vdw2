### Virtually all researchers focus only on a single monotherapy   
&nbsp; &nbsp; such as Vitamin D, [~~#F00:Magnesium~~](/posts/magnesium-and-vitamin-d), [~~#00F:Omega-3~~](/tags/00fomega-3.html), [~~#090:Vitamin K2~~](/posts/overview-vitamin-k-and-vitamin-d), . . .

* [Vitamin D Cofactors in a nutshell](/posts/vitamin-d-cofactors-in-a-nutshell) <span style="color:#F00;">Magnesium</span>, <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span>, <span style="color:#090;">Vitamin K2</span>, Calcium, Boron

> Each cofactor increases the amount of vitamin D getting to the cells

> Sometimes a cofactor has almost as much health benefit as Vitamin D by itself

#### Many of the monotherapies appear to be synergistic with Vitamin D

* Example:  [~~#F00:Magnesium~~](/posts/magnesium-and-vitamin-d-similar-different-and-synergistic)

### Some practitioners started with Vitamin D,   
&nbsp; &nbsp; then added nutrients to substantially improve their results and/or reduce problems

#### Coimbra Protocol for Multiple Sclerosis, [Autoimmune Diseases](/posts/interview-and-transcript-vitamin-d-protocol-for-autoimmune-diseases-dr-coimbra-2016), [Cancer?](/posts/vitamin-d-and-sun-conference-germany)

* [Eliminates symptoms in > 90% of MSers](/posts/high-dose-vitamin-d-to-treat-multiple-sclerosis-etc-protocol)

> by adding <span style="color:#F00;">Magnesium</span>, <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span>, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B12. Chromium Picolinate, Selenium, Choline , CoQ10

#### Doctor reduced patient visits from 4 per year to 1 per year

* [Dr. who got patients to vitamin D level of 80 ng got 2,000 patients to 80 ng/ml](/tags/dr-who-got-patients-to-vitamin-d-level-of-80-ng-got-2000-patients-to-80-ngml.html)

> He added <span style="color:#F00;">Magnesium</span>, Iodine, Vitamin C

#### Cluster Headaches

* Vitamin D + <span style="color:#F00;">Magnesium</span> treated 80% of [cluster headaches](/posts/cluster-headaches-virtually-eliminated-in-7000-people-with-high-dose-vitamin-d-and-cofactors)

> 90% success with added <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span>, Calcium, <span style="color:#090;">Vitamin K2</span>, Vitamin A, Vitamin Bs, Zinc, Boron

#### Trauma

* [Vitamin D + Glutamine cut deaths in half](/posts/vitamin-d-and-glutamine-reduced-trauma-center-deaths-by-half-matthews)

#### Traumatic Brain Injury

* [Vitamin D + Progesterone +~~#00F:Omega-3~~ + glutamine](/posts/traumatic-brain-injury-treated-by-vitamin-d-progesterone-omega-3-and-glutamine)

### Probable Multitherapies (Vitamin D + X + Y) in the future include:

#### Pregnancy - adding <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span> and [~~#F00:Magnesium~~](/posts/pregnancy-helped-by-magnesium-many-studies)

#### [Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D + ~~#00F:Omega-3~~ - RCT](/posts/gestational-diabetes-treated-by-vitamin-d-plus-omega-3-rct)

#### Asthma <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span>

#### Cardiovascular Disease <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span>, <span style="color:#090;">Vitamin K</span>

#### Cystic Fibrosis [~~#00F:Omega-3~~ by itself - RCT](/posts/cystic-fibrosis-problems-cut-in-half-by-omega-3-rct)

#### Mortality - Vitamin D and [~~#F00:Magnesium~~](/posts/all-cause-mortality-is-related-to-low-magnesium-rather-than-low-vitamin-d) independently claim to be best

### Note by Henry Lahore - founder of VitaminDWiki

 **Hedging my bets** 

1. [I take ALL of the cofactors](/posts/low-cost-cofactors-for-vitamin-d) to raise the Vitamin D level in my blood

1. I increase the amount of Vitamin D [getting to cells](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) by taking <span style="color:#F00;">Magnesium</span>, <span style="color:#00F;">Omega-3</span>, Resveratrol, [Quercetin](/posts/quercetin-a-flavonoid-helps-activate-the-vitamin-d-receptor-many-studies), and having intense exercise

> The [Vitamin D Receptor](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) has been proven to severely restrict how much vitamin D gets to the cells in 29 health problems as of May 2017
