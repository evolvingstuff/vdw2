#### [Juvent](http://www.juvent.com/health/) Micro-Impact Platform - $3,500 - Nov 2017

* Computer and software find the resonant frequency of the user in a safe range of frequencies (32Hz-37Hz) and therefore is able to use a very small level of energy (.3g) to deliver a physiologically effective energy pulse. 

* "Simply standing on the Juvent Platform for 10 to 20 minutes a day. Youâ€™ll feel a subtle, pleasant stimulation. Starting at your feet and legs, it extends upward through your torso, arms, and upper body. Using our platform just three days a week has been shown to help improve blood flow, ease joint, knee and back pain, and increase stability."

## [Vitamin D supplementation and falls: a trial sequential meta-analysis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213858714700683) July 2014

did NOT find that vitamin D affected rate of falls.

All of the detail is behind a $28 paywall, so it is impossible to understand the conclusion.

Suspect that a majority of the trials considered used 

1. Small doses of vitamin D

1. Small time intervals.

1. No or little Calcium
