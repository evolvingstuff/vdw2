 **[Addressing Vitamin D Deficiency Can Save Healthcare Costs, and Lives](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/addressing-vitamin-d-deficiency-can-save-healthcare-costs-lives/?utm_source=newsletter-main&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsletters)** 

Vitamin D is associated with all eight of eight of the chronic diseases reported to be the most expensive

*  **Heart Disease and Stroke**  (cost the healthcare system $216 billion) (Benjamin et al., 2018)

*  **Cancer**  (Cancer care costs are expected to reach almost $240 billion by 2030) (Mariotto et al., 2020)

*  **Diabetes**  (Estimated medical and lost productivity cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was $327 billion) (American Diabetes Association, 2018)

*  **Obesity**  (Costs $147 billion per year to the US healthcare system) (Finkelstein et al., 2009)

*  **Arthritis**  ($303.5 billion, which includes $140 for medical costs and $164 billion for indirect costs with lost wages) (Murphy et al., 2018)

*  **Alzheimer’s Disease**  ($305 billion for patient care and treatment) (Alzheimer’s Impact Movement and Alzheimer’s Association, 2020)

*  **Epilepsy**  ($8.6 billion in direct healthcare costs in 2016) (Dieleman et al., 2020)

*  **Tooth Decay**  ($45 billion in lost productivity) (Righolt et al., 2018)

Of the 30 leading  **causes of death**  reported in the United States in 2010, 19 were linked to low vitamin D status
