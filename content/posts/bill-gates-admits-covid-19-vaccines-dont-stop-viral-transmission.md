*  **Gates: "We got vaccines that help you with your health, but they only slightly reduce transmission.”** 

 **[32 minute inteview -mainly on climate change, This starts with his Vaccine comment](https://youtu.be/CZplF4qdwII?t=1678)** 

* "Further intriguing is the fact that Bill Gates is permitted to make such a statement without recourse, while any other individual would be immediately struck down by internet censors for making such a claim."

* "For example, the Google-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, recently broadened its censorship policy to ban all medical and vaccine "misinformation" under a new policy — which specifically includes a ban on any " **claims that vaccines do not reduce transmission**  or contraction of disease."
