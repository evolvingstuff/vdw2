#### Informal intervention trial in Myanmar - Dr. Khin Win

 **1200 Buddhist monks and nuns in COVID-19 quarantine center were given water containing** 

* 40,000 IU of vitamin D

* 50 mg of zinc

* 2 grams of vitamin C 

* 60 billion Probiotics.

 **only 1 person died (mortality rate = 0.07%)** 

The overall COVID-19 mortality rate in the country is steady at  **2.1%** 

$56 of Vitamin D + misc. other ingredients conservatively saved the lives of 6 of those 1200 people

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **about $10 of vitamin D per life saved** 

The doctors in that country (as well as most other countries) do not believe in such large doses of Vitamin D

The Buddhist monks were not constrained by doctors beliefs

People in Myanmar are placed in quarantine centers if they test positive for COVID-19

The Buddhists have their own quarantine center (s?)

The Vitamin D water was given to every Buddhist in the quarantine center. not just given upon entry to the center

A total of about 300 people were tested for vitamin D levels both before and after.

The initial level varied: mostly around 12-18 ng/mL

&nbsp; However, those monks who had gone out for alms (with head, shoulders,  and feet exposed to the sun)  had ~40ng/mL.

The vitamin D water given was based on a proposal by Vitamin DWiki

To reduce costs, the more expensive ingredients were not included
