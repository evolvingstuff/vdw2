# Correcting the Vitamin D Deficiency Epidemic

### strategies to Fight Diseases and Prolong Life for Black People

By Emily Allison-Francis, 2011 [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Correcting-Vitamin-Deficiency-Epidemic-Strategies/dp/0912444495/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1327423339&sr=8-1), can look-inside the book,   $17

It is the only Vitamin D BOOK which I am aware of which starts to address concerns of Blacks

The author felt what I said about the book was incorrect and contacted her lawyer.

I have always disliked confrontations.

I removed my review Feb 5, 2012
