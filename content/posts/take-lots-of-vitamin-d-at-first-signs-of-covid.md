**If you suspect COVID-19 symptoms, immediately take vitamin D   
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  (200,000 IU = 10 days sunbathing on a beach)** 

 **Emergency Vitamin D** 

* Quickly energizes the body's immune system

* Vitamin D can fight COVID-19 only if taken soon after infection

* Works equally well with vaccinated (breakthru) and unvaccinated people

* Anticipate that more than half of the people immediately taking Vitamin D will not even test positive for COVID

* Taking Emergency Vitamin D will also extinguish colds, and flu (helps even if the symptoms are not COVID)

* 50,000 IU capsules are widely available on Amazon (50,000 size is rarely available in local stores)

* Vitamin D is like a small fire extinguisher, it can easily put out small blazes  but not large ones

You can get the benefits 12 hours sooner by putting the powder from at least 1/2 of the capsules under your tongue, thereby eliminating the digestive system delay(perhaps have a picture of powder on a spoon)

If you know that your Vitamin D levels is > 30 ng, then . . . . 

&nbsp; &nbsp;perhaps also fewer capsules if vaccinated

Proofs - details via short URL & QR code

this is far less than the upper tolerable limit

Perhaps take 1/2  dose the second day** Suggestion about how many to take home **Self + 1 for each family member or other close contacts** [Can get 50,000 IU Vitamin D anywhere on the globe](/posts/can-get-50000-iu-vitamin-d-anywhere-on-the-globe)__

#### Notes of possible things to add

Time of day, cofactors, eat with a fatty meal not important

More important is to move around - to pump the lymph system - to engage it more quickly

Zinc also appears to help - 6 times per day, under the tongue

Vitamin D can also be used for prevention, in addition to early treatment~/tc~
