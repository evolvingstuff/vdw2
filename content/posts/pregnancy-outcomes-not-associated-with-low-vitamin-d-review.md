OBJECTIVE:

We undertook a systematic review to assess normative levels of vitamin D in early pregnancy and association with subsequent pregnancy outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN:

Medline and Embase databases and reference lists were searched. Inclusion criteria were pregnant populations, blood sample taken during the first trimester, and serum hydroxyvitamin D levels assessed.

RESULTS:

Eighteen studies reported vitamin D levels in first trimester (n = 11-3730), and 5 examined pregnancy outcomes. 

Mean vitamin D concentrations differed when stratified by ethnicity: 

* white (mean {SD}: 29.4 {11.7 } to 73.1 {27.1} nmol/L) and 

* non-white (15.2 {12.1} to 43 {12} nmol/L).

Most studies used general population cut points to define deficiency and found a large proportion of women deficient. 

Two articles examined risk of preeclampsia and reported differing findings, whereas 2 of 3 found low levels associated with increased risk of small-for-gestational age births.

CONCLUSION:

There is no clear definition of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy and insufficient evidence to suggest low vitamin D levels in early pregnancy are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### This conflicts with the rest of the studies

### Their conversions for vitamin D appear to have an error

 **White**  29.4 nmol does equal <span style="color:#F00;">12 ng/ml</span>

 **Non-white**  15.2 nmol does NOT equal 12.1ng/ml, but does equal <span style="color:#F00;">6 ng/ml</span>
