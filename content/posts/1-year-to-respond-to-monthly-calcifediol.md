Background: We assessed the long-term (24 months) efficacy and safety of monthly calcifediol (0.266 mg) in the correction and maintenance of total 25(OH)D levels in postmenopausal women with basal values <30 ng/mL. 

Methods: We initially enrolled 45 consecutive patients during the period September 2019-September 2020. After an initial visit, patients were instructed to return at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months for measuring serum total 25(OH)D, ionised calcium, creatinine and isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (bALP). Here, we report only the per-protocol analysis, because the COVID-19 pandemic precluded adherence to the scheduled visits for some patients. 

Results: The patients' mean age was 62.4 ± 9.0 years. Mean basal 25(OH)D levels were 20.5 ± 5.3 ng/mL. There was a continuous increase of mean 25(OH)D values (p for trend < 0.001). However, mean values at month 24 (36.7 ± 15.9) were not significantly different in respect to values at month 12 (41.2 ± 11.18). At 24 months, only 1 out 19 patients had a value <20 ng/mL. There was a significant decrease with time of mean values of bALP (p < 0.0216), with no significant changes between 12 and 24 months. No significant changes were observed as far as ionised calcium or creatinine were concerned. 

Conclusions: The long-term administration of calcifediol maintains stable and sustained 25(OH)D concentrations, with no safety concerns.
