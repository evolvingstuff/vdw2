#### Type 2 Diabetes in Chinese is 50 percent more likely if have Vitamin D Receptor gene problem – meta-analysis 2016

 **The genetic polymorphisms in vitamin D receptor and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: an updated meta-analysis.** 

Asia Pac J Clin Nutr. 2016;25(3):614-24. [doi: 10.6133/apjcn.092015.12.](https://doi.org/10.6133/apjcn.092015.12.)

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) genetic polymorphisms are considered to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but this is inconclusive. The aim of this study is to quantify the association between polymorphisms of BsmI and FokI in the VDR gene and T2DM risk through literature review.

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN:

Original articles published from 1999 to June 2014 were discovered through PubMed, ISI Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Wanfang Database, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with software STATA version 12.0.

RESULTS:

Twenty-three articles containing 30 case-control studies were included. The association between the BsmI polymorphism and T2DM was weak in two genetic models (Bb vs bb and BB+Bb vs bb). The subgroup analysis showed that this association was only found in the studies with a small sample size (<200). A strong association between FokI polymorphism and T2DM indicated that this gene polymorphism was possibly a risk factor for T2DM (ff vs FF: OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.28-1.93, p<0.001; Ff vs FF: OR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.31-1.81, p<0.001; ff+Ff vs FF: OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.35-1.83, p<0.001), especially in Chinese populations.

CONCLUSION:

More reliable conclusions about associations between VDR genetic polymorphisms and T2DM will depend on studies with larger sample size and by ethnicity.

#### Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphisms and Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-analysis.- March 2013

Arch Med Res. 2013 Mar 15. pii: S0188-4409(13)00047-7. [doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2013.02.002.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2013.02.002.)

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A number of studies have shown that polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene are implicated in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). 

However, the results are inconsistent and inconclusive.

METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed to analyze the association among the four polymorphisms (FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI) in the VDR gene and T2D susceptibility. 

A total of 14 articles were included in this meta-analysis.

RESULTS: FokI polymorphism was associated with an overall significantly increased risk of T2D (f vs. F: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.41; the extreme model ff vs. FF: OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.94; the recessive model ff vs. Ff + FF: OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.25, 1.82). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant association between the Fok1 polymorphism and T2D in an Asian population.

CONCLUSIONS: There was no between-study heterogeneity in any of these analyses. 

No significant associations were observed among the BsmI, ApaI and TaqI variants andT2D risk. 

This meta-analysis suggests that the FokI polymorphism of the VDR gene could be a risk factor for T2D, especially in an Asian population.
