##### One possible pathway: Diabetes deactivates the VDR, which results in less Vitamin D getting to cells - such as in the eye

#### Asked Perplexity AI: Is diabetic retinopathy related to glaucoma?** 

 **Yes, diabetic retinopathy is related to glaucoma** , particularly in the context of neovascular glaucoma and potentially primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes characterized by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision impairment and blindness. This condition can influence the development of glaucoma in several ways:

Neovascular Glaucoma: Diabetic retinopathy can lead to the formation of new, abnormal blood vessels on the retina and the iris, a condition known as neovascularization. These new vessels can block the natural drainage of aqueous humor from the eye, leading to increased intraocular pressure (IOP), which is a primary factor in glaucoma. Neovascular glaucoma is a specific type of glaucoma directly associated with diabetic retinopathy and is considered a severe and difficult-to-treat form of the disease

Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG): The relationship between diabetic retinopathy and POAG is more complex and less direct. Some studies suggest that diabetic retinopathy may be associated with or even predict the development of POAG. This is thought to be due to overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms, such as neurodegeneration and impairment of vascular supply to the optic nerve head, which are common in both conditions

. However, the evidence is not entirely consistent, and more research is needed to clarify this relationship.

Impact on Glaucoma Management: The presence of diabetic retinopathy can complicate the diagnosis and management of glaucoma. For example, changes in the retina and optic nerve due to diabetic retinopathy can interfere with the assessment of glaucoma through imaging and functional tests. This makes it challenging to distinguish between damage caused by glaucoma and changes resulting from diabetic retinopathy

In summary, while diabetic retinopathy is directly linked to the development of neovascular glaucoma, its relationship with primary open-angle glaucoma is less clear and subject to ongoing research. Nonetheless, the presence of diabetic retinopathy in a patient with diabetes necessitates careful monitoring and management of potential glaucoma to prevent vision loss

   * "Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 3 million people in the United States, and yet half of those affected are unaware, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

   * "Five % of 70-year-olds had the disease, and half of those did not know they had it before they took part in the study."

   * "Five percent of 560 70-year-olds had the disease, and half of those did not know they had it before they took part in the study."

* [Glaucoma in the African American and Hispanic Communities: What We Know in 2023](https://www.brightfocus.org/glaucoma/article/glaucoma-african-american-and-hispanic-communities#:~:text=African%20Americans%20and%20Hispanics%20are,take%20to%20prevent%20vision%20loss.)

   * "Adjusting for age, African Americans were  **3 to 4 times**  more likely to have a diagnosis of glaucoma compared to Caucasians."

* Note: One indication that a disease is related to Vitamin D is if it is more prominent in people with dark skin (they get less D from the sun)
