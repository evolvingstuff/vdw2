* This Meta-analysis concluded that across all sizes of dosing that Vitamin D did not help

* However, the trials which used large doses did find big benefits

   * 40,000 IU/day, 300,000 IU per month

 **Meta-analysis on this page is similar to many Vitamin D meta-analyses.   
When dose size is ignored, there is no average benefit   
A similar meta-analysis would conclude that aspirin does not reduce headaches (if doses sizes ranged from 20 mg to 300 mg)**

 **Highlights** 

* There are more than 2 million individuals affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) worldwide, and most patients are faced with a poor prognosis after several remission and relapse cycles. Vitamin D deficiency is widely considered to be an environmental risk factor for MS. And some studies have reported significantly lower vitamin D levels in MS patients than in healthy controls. Therefore, some studies used vitamin D as a therapy of MS. Prompted by the lack of meta-analyses investigating the association between MS and vitamin D, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D in MS patients.

* In this analysis, our findings suggest that vitamin D appeared to have no therapeutic effect on Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and annual relapse rate (ARR) in the patients with MS.

Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelination disorder in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to a high level of neurological disability. The pathogenesis of MS remains largely unknown, which explains the lack of significant efficacy of therapy in MS. Vitamin D deficiency is widely considered to be an environmental risk factor for MS. Many studies investigating the therapeutic effects of vitamin D on MS have been applied. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D in MS patients.

Methods

To obtain a more comprehensive estimate of the efficacy of vitamin D on MS patients, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the role of vitamin D in MS. The PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched in October 2017. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials recorded within the three main databases were considered. The analysis was conducted for two specific outcomes: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and annual relapse rate (ARR).

Results

Vitamin D3 as add-on treatment had no significant therapeutic effect on MS according to EDSS score (mean difference -0.01 <span>[95% CI -0.34 to 0.33]</span>). The ARR was higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group (mean difference 0.05 <span>[95% CI 0.01 to 0.1]</span>).

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that vitamin D appeared to have no therapeutic effect on EDSS score or ARR in the patients with MS.
