Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly individuals and is associated with progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction. A significant association between AD and low levels of vitamin D has been demonstrated. 

Furthermore, vitamin D supplements appear to have a beneficial clinical effect on AD by 

* regulating micro-RNA, 

* enhancing toll-like receptors, 

* modulating vascular endothelial factor expression, 

* modulating angiogenin, and 

* advanced glycation end products. 

Vitamin D also exerts its effects on AD by 

* regulating calcium-sensing receptor expression, 

* enhancing amyloid-β peptides clearance, 

* interleukin 10, 

* downregulating matrix metalloproteinases, 

* upregulating heme oxygenase 1, and 

* suppressing the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate expression. 

In conclusion, vitamin D may play a beneficial role in AD. 

Calcitriol is the best vitamin D supplement for AD, because it is the active form of the vitamin D3 metabolite and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. 

Therefore, further investigation of the role of calcitriol in AD is needed.
