#### Comparative analysis of fourteen COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation systems and claim approval rates

Vaccine Volume 52, 11 April 2025, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.126830

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/covid-19-vaccine-injury-claims.webp" alt="image" width="800">

Purpose

No-fault vaccine injury compensation schemes provide financial redress for adverse effects from vaccines without establishing fault. Due to the rapid vaccine development and distribution, these programs are crucial for vaccinees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigating the performance differences of these schemes worldwide and finding a more balanced approach is essential to responses to future pandemics.

Materials and methods

This study examines the structure and effectiveness of 14 no-fault vaccine injury compensation schemes, analyzing data on approval rates for COVID-19 vaccine injury claims. Data sources include government reports and academic studies to compare diverse operational models and funding sources.

Results

This study included 167,532 COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation applications, with up to 137,076 claims reviewed and up to 38,658 approved, incorporating both exact and approximate official numbers. Approval rates for the reviewed claims vary widely across jurisdictions, with Japan (74.29 %) having the highest rates, and the United States (3 %) and the United Kingdom (2.64 %) the lowest. The median approval rate across all 14 jurisdictions is 26.76 %, between South Korea's 26.09 % and France's 27.42 %. These variations reflect diverse standards and policies. No clear correlation exists between funding sources and approval rates. For example, government-funded schemes in France and Japan show higher approval rates, while similar models in the United States and the United Kingdom have low rates. In New Zealand and other countries with broader medical compensation schemes, approval rates are higher than the international median.

Conclusion

Governments may adopt more flexible standards to redress vaccine injuries by referring to international practices and the latest medical evidence. High-approval-rate countries offer insights into inclusive criteria, while low-approval-rate countries may need to reassess stringent criteria. Middle-ground countries could incorporate new medical findings to refine standards, ensuring equitable outcomes for those affected by vaccine injuries.
