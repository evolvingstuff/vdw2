BACKGROUND:

Obesity is recognized as a major health problem. Vitamin D is involved in maintaining energy metabolism by regulation of glucose transporters, uncoupling proteins, and normal brain function. We aimed to explore a relationship between impulsivity, eating behaviors, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in a sample of 322 bariatric surgery candidates.

METHODS:

Participants completed a questionnaire on their health, eating habits and The Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Impulsivity was evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Blood samples were obtained to measure levels of 25(OH)D, lipids (cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol), and glucose.

RESULTS:

Overall scores on the BIS-11, along with scores on the Attentional Subscale of the BIS were significantly higher in participants with higher frequency of snack food consumption. Scores on the Attentional Subscale of the BIS were higher in participants who self-reported eating in response to emotions. Participants who reported eating at night or declared intense emotions associated with a desire-to-eat had the highest global, attentional, and non-planning impulsivity levels. Scores on the Non-planning Subscale of the BIS-11 were elevated in participants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations lower than 10ng/ml.

CONCLUSIONS:

The results suggest that the higher level of impulsivity among the patients with obesity is associated with eating habits, and support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to impulsiveness.
