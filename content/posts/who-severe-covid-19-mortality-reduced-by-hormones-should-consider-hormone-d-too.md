**WHO guideline panel looked at two  COVID-19 corticosteroid meta-analyses and found that** 

*  **Relative risk of 28 day mortality <span style="color:#00F;">reduced 20%</span>  if severe** 

*  **Relative risk of 28 day mortality <span style="color:#F00;">increased 20%</span> if non-severe** 

 **Note: There might be ZERO benefit from corticosteroids, even for those with severe COVID-19** 

 **The treatment might have only delayed deaths beyond the 28 day cut- off point**
