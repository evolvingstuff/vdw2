Growing evidence from a variety of experimental models shows that boron is a bioactive and beneficial (perhaps essential) element for humans. Reported beneficial actions of boron include arthritis alleviation or risk reduction, bone growth and maintenance, central nervous system function, cancer risk reduction, hormone facilitation, and immune response, inflammation, and oxidative stress modulation. The diverse effects of boron indicate that it influences the formation and/or activity of an entity that is involved in many biochemical processes. Formation of boroesters with the ribose moiety of compounds involved in numerous reactions, such as S-adenosylmethionine and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) might be the reason for boron bioactivity. 

Both animal and human data suggest that boron intakes should be >1.0 mg/d. Many people consume less than this amount. Thus, a low boron intake should be considered a health concern, which can be prevented by diets rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and pulses.
