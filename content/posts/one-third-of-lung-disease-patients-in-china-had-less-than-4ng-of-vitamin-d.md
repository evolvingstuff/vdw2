Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a global problem. 

Methods: We estimated the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations to confirm whether patients with lung diseases in eastern China showed vitamin D deficiency and whether this deficiency was related to the risk of lung cancer.We used chemiluminescence to estimate the 25(OH)D concentrations in 250 patients from eastern China, of whom 197 had untreated stage III/IV lung cancer and 53 had benign lung diseases. 

Results: The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration of patients with lung cancer was 10.63 ± 7.04 ng/mL and that of patients with benign lung disease was 9.62 ± 6.37 ng/mL. Although there was no significant difference between the values, the mean serum concentrations of 25(OH)D obtained in patients with lung cancer and benign lung diseases were lower than the normal value (>20 ng/mL); p values in both cases were less than 0.0001. 

 **Among the 250 patients, 90 showed low serum 25(OH)D levels of  4 ng/mL.** 

Conclusions: Patients with lung diseases in eastern China show low serum levels of 25(OH)D, and the average serum 25(OH)D level is much below the normal vitamin D level. Presently it cannot be concluded whether the low levels of 25(OH)D is a risk factor for lung cancer, because the average serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with lung cancer or benign lung diseases are very low.
