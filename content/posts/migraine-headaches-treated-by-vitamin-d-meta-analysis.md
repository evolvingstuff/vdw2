Introduction: The efficacy of vitamin D for migraine remains controversial. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the influence of vitamin D versus placebo on treatment in migraine patients.

Methods: We search PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases through April 2020 for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of vitamin D versus placebo on treatment efficacy in migraine patients. This meta-analysis is performed using the random-effect model.

Results: Five randomized controlled trials are included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control group in migraine patients, vitamin D treatment is associated with 

* substantially reduced number of headache days 

   * (standard mean difference <span>[SMD]</span>, -0.53; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, -0.83 to -0.23; P = 0.0006),

* frequency of headache attacks (SMD, -1.09; 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.32; P = 0.006), 

* headache severity (SMD, -0.55; 95% CI, -0.91 to -0.19; P = 0.0003), and 

* Migraine Disability Assessment score (SMD, -0.76; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.40; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions: Vitamin D treatment is effective to alleviate migraine.
