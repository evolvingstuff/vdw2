“Greater than 3,000: that’s how many new cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are diagnosed every year in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ALL is responsible for 20% of all cancers in people younger than 20 years old.  And, sadly, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute finds that up to 1 in 5 kids who undergo chemotherapy for ALL will relapse – even if they initially receive a complete remission of the cancer.”

#### Therapy-induced mutations drive the genomic landscape of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia

study was published in BLOOD https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019002220

* “Relapse-specific somatic alterations were enriched in 12 genes (NR3C1, NR3C2, TP53, NT5C2, FPGS, CREBBP, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, WHSC1, PRPS1, and PRPS2) involved in drug response. Their prevalence was 17% in very early relapse (<9 months from diagnosis), 65% in early relapse (9-36 months), and 32% in late relapse (>36 months) groups.”
