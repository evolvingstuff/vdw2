 **Note: to believe that a measurement is not ddue to chance it must have a P <0.05** 

 **This measurement has a P = 0.0000000000000000005** 

#### Note: Several Cancers have "<span style="color:#00F;">learned</span>" how to protect themselves from Vitamin D  
After the cancer starts, it decreases the Vitamin D Receptor activation.  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus for some cancers: <span style="color:#00F;">Cancer ==> poor VDR</span>, rather than poor VDR ==> Cancer
