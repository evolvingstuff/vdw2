Objectives

A few studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with the occurrence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Hence, the aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore such a potential association.

Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted in June 2019. The inclusion criteria were (a) observational studies that assessed the relationship between vitamin D and RAS, and (b) the outcome measures reported quantitative vitamin D levels. Studies without control groups, case series, case reports, experimental studies, letter to editors, reviews, were excluded. The random effects model was conducted for meta-analyses using RevMan 5.3 software.

Results

Five studies comprising 208 RAS patients and 241 healthy individuals were included. All studies except one reported significantly lower levels of vitamin D in RAS patients compared with the healthy individuals. The results of the pooled 5 studies revealed statistically significant lower levels of vitamin D in RAS patients (Mean Difference (MD) = −9.67 ng/ml, 95% CI = −15.68, −3.65; p ˂ .002).

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis suggests a significant association between low vitamin D levels and RAS. Further well-designed studies with adequate sample sizes are required to elucidate the role of vitamin D in pathogenesis of RAS.

Background-aim: To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the frequency and duration of attacks in patients of PFAPA syndrome with low vitamin D levels.

Methods: This retrospective study comprised PFAPA patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency between 2018 and 2023. The frequency and duration of PFAPA attacks before and after vitamin D supplementation were noted.

Results: Seventy-one patients were included. Of the 71 patients, 24 (33.8%) had vitamin D insufficiency, and 47 (66.2%) had vitamin D deficiency. In patients with vitamin D insufficiency, mean attack frequency and mean attack duration before vitamin D supplementation were 4.3 ± 1.9/year and 2.2 ± 1.6 days, respectively, while mean attack frequency and mean attack duration after vitamin D supplementation were 3.5 ± 2.7/year per year and 1.3 ± 0.9 days respectively (p = 0.2, p = 0.2, respectively).
 In patients with vitamin D deficiency, mean attack frequency and mean attack duration before vitamin D supplementation were 7.4 ± 2.1/year and 2.2 ± 1.6 days, respectively, while mean attack frequency and mean attack duration after vitamin D supplementation were 3.3 ± 2.4/year and 1.3 ± 0.9 days respectively (p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.04, respectively). When the vitamin D level and the frequency of attacks were compared, the cut-off value of vitamin D was found to be 29.7 nmol/L.

Conclusions: In PFAPA patients with low vitamin D levels, the frequency and duration of PFAPA attacks were reduced with vitamin D supplementation. Especially at vitamin D level cut-off &gt; 29.7 nmol/L, the frequency of attacks reduced significantly.

Objectives
A few studies have associated vitamin D deficiency with the occurrence of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). Hence, the aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore such a potential association.

Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted in June 2019. The inclusion criteria were (a) observational studies that assessed the relationship between vitamin D and RAS, and (b) the outcome measures reported quantitative vitamin D levels. Studies without control groups, case series, case reports, experimental studies, letter to editors, reviews, were excluded. The random effects model was conducted for meta-analyses using RevMan 5.3 software.

Results
Five studies comprising 208 RAS patients and 241 healthy individuals were included. All studies except one reported significantly lower levels of vitamin D in RAS patients compared with the healthy individuals. The results of the pooled 5 studies revealed statistically significant lower levels of vitamin D in RAS patients (Mean Difference (MD) = −9.67 ng/ml, 95% CI = −15.68, −3.65; p ˂ .002).

Conclusion
The present meta-analysis suggests a significant association between low vitamin D levels and RAS. Further well-designed studies with adequate sample sizes are required to elucidate the role of vitamin D in pathogenesis of RAS.
