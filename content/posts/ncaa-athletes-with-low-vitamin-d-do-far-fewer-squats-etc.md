Increasing evidence indicates that compromised vitamin D status, as indicated by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D), is associated with decreased muscle function. The purpose of this study was to determine the vitamin D status of collegiate athletes residing in the southern U.S. and its effects on muscular strength and anaerobic power. Collegiate athletes (n=103) from three separate NCAA athletic programs were recruited for the study. Anthropometrics, vitamin D and calcium intake, and sun exposure data were collected along with serum 25-OH D and physical performance measures (Vertical Jump Test, Shuttle Run Test, Triple Hop for Distance Test and the 1  **Repetition Maximum Squat Test** ) to determine the influence of vitamin D status on muscular strength and anaerobic power. Approximately 

* 68% of the study participants were vitamin D adequate (>75 nmol/L), whereas 

* 23% were insufficient (75-50 nmol/L) and 

* 9%, predominantly non-Caucasian athletes, were deficient (<50 nmol/L). 

Athletes who had lower vitamin D status had reduced performance scores (P<0.01) with odds ratios of 

* 0.85 on the Vertical Jump Test, 

* 0.82 on the Shuttle Run Test, 

* 0.28 on the Triple Hop for Distance Test, and 

* 0.23 on the 1 RM Squat Test. 

These findings demonstrate that even NCAA athletes living in the southern US are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency and that maintaining adequate vitamin D status may be important for these athletes to optimize their muscular strength and power.
