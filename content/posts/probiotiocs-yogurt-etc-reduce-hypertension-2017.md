#### Yogurt and Cardiometabolic Diseases: A Critical Review of Potential Mechanisms Nov 2017

Adv Nutr. 2017 Nov 15;8(6):812-829. [doi: 10.3945/an.116.013946.](https://doi.org/10.3945/an.116.013946.) Print 2017 Nov.

Associations between yogurt intake and risk of diet-related cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) have been the subject of recent research in epidemiologic nutrition. A healthy dietary pattern has been identified as a pillar for the prevention of weight gain and CMDs. Epidemiologic studies suggest that yogurt consumption is linked to healthy dietary patterns, lifestyles, and reduced risk of CMDs, particularly type 2 diabetes. However, to our knowledge, few to no randomized controlled trials have investigated yogurt intake in relation to cardiometabolic clinical outcomes. Furthermore, there has been little attempt to clarify the mechanisms that underlie the potential beneficial effects of yogurt consumption on CMDs. Yogurt is a nutrient-dense dairy food and has been suggested to reduce weight gain and prevent CMDs by contributing to intakes of protein, calcium, bioactive lipids, and several other micronutrients. In addition, fermentation with bacterial strains generates bioactive peptides, resulting in a potentially greater beneficial effect of yogurt on metabolic health than nonfermented dairy products such as milk. To date, there is little concrete evidence that the mechanisms proposed in observational studies to explain positive results of yogurt on CMDs or parameters are valid. Many proposed mechanisms are based on assumptions that commercial yogurts contain strain-specific probiotics, that viable yogurt cultures are present in adequate quantities, and that yogurt provides a minimum threshold dose of nutrients or bioactive components capable of exerting a physiologic effect. 

Therefore, the primary objective of this review is to  **investigate the plausibility**  of potential mechanisms commonly cited in the literature in order to shed light on the inverse associations reported between yogurt intake and various cardiometabolic health parameters that are related to its nutrient profile, bacterial constituents, and food matrix. This article reviews current gaps and challenges in identifying such mechanisms and provides a perspective on the research agenda to validate the proposed role of yogurt in protecting against CMDs.

Hypertension (HTN) has become a global public health concern and a major risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney diseases. The complex interplay of genetic and environmental influences is important for the development of the disease. Accumulating evidence has illustrated the association of dysbiosis of gut microbiota with hypertension. Certain gut microbial strains may play either a pathogenic or a protective role in the development of hypertension. Oral probiotics can therefore represent a therapeutic approach for hypertension treatment. However, the relevant scientific work has only just begun, and the available data in this field remain limited. Fortunately, recent technological developments that permit identification of microbes and their products using culture-independent molecular detection techniques. In this review, we summarize the role of gut microbiota in hypertension progression, and probiotics in the treatment of hypertension.

#### Gut microbiota as a potential target of metabolic syndrome: the role of probiotics and prebiotics Oct 2017

Cell Biosci. 2017 Oct 25;7:54. [doi: 10.1186/s13578-017-0183-1.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-017-0183-1.) eCollection 2017.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) comprises central obesity, increased plasma glucose levels, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and its incidence is increasing due to changes in lifestyle and dietary structure in recent years. MS has been proven to be associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus, leading to morbidity and mortality. In this manuscript, we review recent studies concerning the role of the gut microbiota in MS modulation. Manipulation of the gut microbiota through the administration of prebiotics or probiotics may assist in weight loss and reduce plasma glucose and serum lipid levels, decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To the best of our knowledge, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile salt hydrolase (BSH), metabolic endotoxemia and the endocannabinoid (eCB) system are essential in regulating the initiation and progression of MS through the normalization of adipogenesis and the regulation of insulin secretion, fat accumulation, energy homeostasis, and plasma cholesterol levels. Therefore, the gut microbiota may serve as a potential therapeutic target for MS. However, further studies are needed to enhance our understanding of manipulating the gut microbiota and the role of the gut microbiota in MS prevention and treatment.

#### Gastrointestinal Tract: a Promising Target for the Management of Hypertension.– April 2017

Curr Hypertens Rep. 2017 Apr;19(4):31. [doi: 10.1007/s11906-017-0726-1.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-017-0726-1.)

The pathogenesis of hypertension remains elusive. Current treatments on hypertension have only achieved modest reductions. Facilitating theoretical research and looking for new therapeutic strategy are urgently needed. Besides food digestion and nutrients absorption, the gastrointestinal tract (GI) has been shown to influence the status of the central nervous system, immune system, metabolism, and cardiovascular homeostasis. Emerging findings demonstrate that endogenous factors derived from GI including gut hormones, autonomic nerve, and gut microbiota play important roles in the regulation of vascular function and/or blood pressure. Meanwhile, evidences from clinical practice and experimental study have found that intervention in GI through metabolic surgery, probiotics consumption, and dietary modification can efficiently ameliorate or even remit hypertension and related cardiometabolic diseases. Thus, we propose that GI might be an initiating organ of hypertension and a promising target for the management of hypertension. Further, illuminating this concept may aid to understand the pathogenesis and control of hypertension.

#### Antihypertensive Effects of Probiotics – April 2017

Curr Hypertens Rep. 2017 Apr;19(4):26. [doi: 10.1007/s11906-017-0723-4.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-017-0723-4.)

PURPOSE OF REVIEW:

The present review focuses in the hypertension-associated changes in the microbiota and the current insights regarding the impact of probiotics on blood pressure in animal models and in human hypertensive patients.

RECENT FINDINGS:

Gut dysbiosis in hypertension is characterized by (i) the gut microbioma that is less diverse and less rich with an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and (ii) a decrease in acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in lactate-producing bacterial populations. The meta-analysis of the human studies supports that supplementation with probiotics reduces blood pressure. The mechanism of this antihypertensive effect of probiotics and its protective effect on endothelial function has not been fully elucidated. Further investigations are needed to clarify if the effects of probiotic bacteria result from the changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic by-products; the restoration of the gut barrier function; and the effects on endotoxemia, inflammation, and renal sympathetic nerve activity.

#### Current Perspectives on Antihypertensive Probiotics June 2017

Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins. 2017 Jun;9(2):91-101. [doi: 10.1007/s12602-016-9241-y.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12602-016-9241-y.)

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Optimizing blood pressure results in an overall health outcome. Over the years, the gut microbiota has been found to play a significant role in host metabolic processes, immunity, and physiology. Dietary strategies have therefore become a target for restoring disturbed gut microbiota to treat metabolic diseases. Probiotics and their fermented products have been shown in many studies to lower blood pressure by suppressing nitrogen oxide production in microphages, reducing reactive oxygen species, and enhancing dietary calcium absorption. Other studies have shown that hypertension could be caused by many factors including hypercholesterolemia, chronic inflammation, and inconsistent modulation of the renin-angiotensin system. This review discusses the antihypertensive roles of probiotics and their fermented products via the reduction of serum cholesterol levels, anti-inflammation, and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. The ability of recombinant probiotics to reduce high blood pressure has also been discussed.
