#### Maternal-fetal vitamin D receptor polymorphisms significantly associated with preterm birth.

* Poor VDR ==> less vitamin D to tissue (fetal tissue in this study)

* Previous miscarriage associated with low maternal or fetal Vitamin D

   * Appears that increasing the activation of fetal/materanl VDR is far more important than just raising Vitamin D levels

   * Using VDR activators might increase both maternal and fetal VDR

PURPOSE:

Preterm birth (PTB) is a complex trait with strong genetic background, whose etiology is not fully understood. It was recently suggested that pregnancy duration is affected by fetal genetic variation even more than by the maternal genome. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is involved in embryonic implantation and fertility. We studied the association between both maternal and neonatal vitamin D receptor (VDR) genetic variation and PTB.

METHODS:

Maternal and fetal (umbilical cord) DNA was isolated from Jewish Israeli idiopathic preterm newborns (24-36 weeks, n = 146) and control term newborns (>37 weeks, n = 229). Maternal and fetal VDR polymorphisms (FokI, ApaI, BsmI, TaqI) were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Using SPSS analysis to correlate VDR genotypes with phenotypic variation: pregnancy duration, preterm birth and spontaneous miscarriages, adjusted for gravidity, parity and gender of newborn.

RESULTS:

Women homozygous to VDR ApaI (AA) genotype had significant twofold increase risk for PTB <span>[OR 1.973, (CI) 1.183-3.289, p = 0.009]</span> compared to heterozygous women. Male newborns had significant (p < 0.05) 1.73-fold increase of PTB. 

Women with history of previous (≥1) spontaneous miscarriage had a significant increased risk for PTB if their newborn carried either of the 

* VDR BsmI homozygous (BB or bb) genotypes compared to the heterozygous (Bb) genotype [OR 6.857, (CI) 1.273-36.934, p = 0.018 and 

*  **OR 9.231** , (CI) 1.753-48.618, p = 0.008, respectively], 

* or VDR ApaI homozygous (AA or aa) genotype compared to heterozygous (Aa) genotype <span>[OR 4.33, (CI) 1.029-18.257, p = 0.046 and OR 7.2, (CI) 1.34-38.917, p = 0.021, respectively]</span>.

CONCLUSIONS:

We show association between maternal and fetal VDR genotype variants with PTB.
