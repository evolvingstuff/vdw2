#### VitaminDWiki grade = B

* Fail to differentiate between vitamin D from wild vs farmed salmon

* Mentions vitamin D product varies with skin type and age 

> – but does not mention that it is a VERY SIGNIFICANT variation: 3X - 5X

* Quite up to date – many 2014 references

* Error:  Says IU of vitamin D is equal to 0.25 mcg of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. (IU= 0.025 mcg)

* Error: the number of  American black mothers that are vitamin D deficient has been found to be very low.

* The possibility exists that a low level of vitamin D is an effect, and not a cause

> Seems to be totally unaware of the <a href="/posts/proof-that-vitamin-d-works" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Proof that Vitamin D Works">45+ clinical trials</a> in which the addition of vitamin D prevented/treated diseases.

* Echoed the literature - but in error: Individuals who get 10-30 minutes of sunlight between 10 am and 3 pm, two times a week, will most often have  enough vitamin D. Exposing the arms and face

> NOPE, arms and face were not enough when it was thought that 1,000 IU was enough, and it is far too little now that it is known that [3,500 IU is needed](/posts/vitamin-d-needs-in-20041000-iu-10-years-later-same-author-says-3500-iu)

> especially for those at high risk such as: shut-in, dark skin, obese, winter, far from equator, elderly, etc.

* Error: research  that  has  focused  on vitamin  D  supplementation  as  a  preventative  measure  or  as  a  treatment has yielded ambiguous results.

> Again <a href="/posts/proof-that-vitamin-d-works" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Proof that Vitamin D Works">Proof that Vitamin D Works</a>

* Error: gave example of 3 children who had problems with 1,400 IU of vitamin D

> Did not appear to be aware of many other studies involving many children - such as [Third study found that Infants needed 1600 IU of vitamin D – JAMA RCT May 2013](/posts/third-study-found-that-infants-needed-1600-iu-of-vitamin-d-jama-rct)

* Error: stated Pneumonia was not related to vitamin D:  see [Pneumonia in seniors was 2.5X more likely if low vitamin D – June 2014](/posts/pneumonia-in-seniors-was-25x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d)
