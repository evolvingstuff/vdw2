The doses of Vitamin D3 for my MS patients during pregnancy ranges from 44,000 iu - 70,000 iu per day. 

All mothers delivered healthy babies and labor was free of complications i.e no pre eclampsia. no birth defects, no autism etc. 

Although MS relapses are very common in the 6 months after pregnancy , not one patient using "Personalized Vitamin D3" suffered a relapse.
