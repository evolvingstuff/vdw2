#### Perspective: School Meal Programs Require Higher Vitamin D Fortification Levels in Milk Products and Plant-Based Alternatives—Evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES 2001–2018)

Poor vitamin D status impairs bone growth and immune defense in school-aged children and adolescents, particularly in minorities. Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency increases the risk of acute viral respiratory infection, underscoring the need for adequate vitamin D intakes during school sessions when viral exposure may be greatest. We studied available vitamin D–related survey data and published findings based on NHANES (2001–2018) to assess the dependency of vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>; in nmol/L) on vitamin D intake (μg/d) in elementary school–aged children (4–8 y), middle school children (9–13 y), and high school adolescents (14–18 y). We sought evidence supporting the need for school programs to facilitate vitamin D adequacy. Usual vitamin D intakes from food and beverages by children/adolescents (NHANES 2015–2018) examined at the 50th percentile intake by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic) showed all age groups consumed less than half of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for vitamin D (10 μg/d), independent of race/ethnicity. NHANES (2001–2010) analyses show evidence of lower vitamin D status in school-aged children that is linked to lower intakes of fortified milk varying over race/ethnicity and age. Adolescents had lower vitamin D status and milk intake than younger children. A total of 22–44% of vitamin D intakes occurred away from home, with larger percentages of total intakes at breakfast and lunch, at times consistent with school meals. Ever-present inadequate vitamin D intakes with a large percentage consumed away from home together with well-established benefits to growth, bone, and immune defense from enriched vitamin D–fortified milk in school intervention trials provide strong justification to require enriched vitamin D–fortified foods in school meals. An easy to implement plan for improving vitamin D intakes is possible through the FDA's amendment allowing higher vitamin D fortification levels of dairy and plant-based milk alternatives that could increase vitamin D intakes beyond the EAR with just 2 daily servings.

   * test scores, 

   * bone growth and 

   * resistance to viral infection.”

#### Fails to address: preschool. older children, no milk in summer, weekends, need more to get >20 ng

 **Might be better to fortify bread: see below**

#### Instead of waiting decades for more fortification, just give your child 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 once a month

50,000 IU monthly = 1600 IU daily

[Third study found that Infants needed 1600 IU of vitamin D – JAMA RCT May 2013](/posts/third-study-found-that-infants-needed-1600-iu-of-vitamin-d-jama-rct)

Summary: 1600 IU vitamin D daily ==> 98% of infants >30 ng

[Can get 50,000 IU Vitamin D anywhere on the globe](/posts/can-get-50000-iu-vitamin-d-anywhere-on-the-globe)

[Vitamin D home fortification- don't wait 100 years for your govt](/posts/vitamin-d-home-fortification-dont-wait-100-years-for-your-govt)

Alternatively: 10,000 IU every SUNday (1400 IU daily average)
