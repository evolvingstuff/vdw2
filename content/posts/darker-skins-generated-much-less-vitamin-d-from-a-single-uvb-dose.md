#### Skin color is relevant to vitamin D synthesis.

Dermatology. 2013;227(3):250-4. [doi: 10.1159/000354750.](https://doi.org/10.1159/000354750.) Epub 2013 Oct 17.

BACKGROUND: Whether dark skin produces less vitamin D after UVB radiation than fair skin remains controversial.

OBJECTIVE: To compare 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25-(OH)-D]</span> levels after a single UVB exposure in fair (phototype II-III) and black-skinned (phototype VI) volunteers.

METHODS: Fair-skinned volunteers (n = 20, 4 males/16 females, mean age: 23.2 years) and black-skinned (n = 11, 6 males/5 females, mean age: 23.8 years) received a single total body UVB exposure (0.022 J/cm(2)). The 25-(OH)-D levels were measured on days 0, 2 and 6.

RESULTS:

On day 0, all volunteers were severely vitamin D deficient. On day 2, 25-(OH)-D levels of fair-skinned volunteers increased significantly (median: 11.9-13.3 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), but not in black-skinned people (median: 8.60-8.55 ng/ml, p = 0.843). Again, on day 6, 25-(OH)-D levels of fair-skinned volunteers increased significantly (median: 11.9-14.3 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), but not in black-skinned people (median: 8.60-9.57 ng/ml, p = 0.375).

CONCLUSION: This study suggests that skin pigmentation negatively influences vitamin D synthesis.

#### Note: fairly weak UVB (0.022 J/cm 2) was used so as to not burn those with very light skin color
