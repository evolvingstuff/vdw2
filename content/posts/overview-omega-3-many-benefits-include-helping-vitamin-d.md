#### Need to take standard Omega-3 with a fatty meal - Google Bard Dec 7, 2023

<!-- ~tc~ startbard ~/tc~ -->

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Does a person need to take Omega-3 with a fatty meal when the Omega-3 is in oil?</span>** 

Yes, taking Omega-3 oil with a fatty meal is generally recommended for optimal absorption. This is because omega-3 fatty acids are fat-soluble, meaning they require the presence of fat in the digestive system to be properly absorbed into the bloodstream.

 **Here's why:** 

* Bile acids: A high-fat meal stimulates the production of bile acids by the liver. These bile acids help to emulsify and break down fats, making them easier for the body to absorb. This includes omega-3 fatty acids present in the oil.

* Micelles: Bile acids form micelles around the omega-3 fatty acids, creating a water-soluble complex that can be transported through the digestive system and absorbed into the bloodstream.

* Absorption rate: Studies have shown that taking omega-3 supplements with a fatty meal can significantly increase their absorption rate compared to taking them on an empty stomach.

Therefore, while you can still absorb some omega-3 oil without a fatty meal, taking it with a meal containing healthy fats like avocado, nuts, seeds, or fatty fish will significantly improve its absorption and maximize its potential health benefits.

 **Here are some additional tips for taking Omega-3 oil with a fatty meal:** 

Take the oil at the beginning of the meal, as this allows for better absorption.

Choose a meal that is naturally high in healthy fats.

Avoid taking omega-3 oil with alcohol or caffeine, as these can interfere with absorption.

Of course, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding the most effective way to take omega-3 supplements for your specific needs.

#### Emulsified Omega-3 does NOT need a fatty meal: Perplexity AI - May 2024

No, emulsified omega-3 supplements do not need to be taken with fatty meals to be effectively absorbed. Emulsified omega-3 supplements are designed to enhance the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, without the need for concurrent high-fat meal consumption. This is achieved through the use of self-micro-emulsifying delivery systems (SMEDS) and other emulsification technologies that simulate the emulsification process of bile, facilitating the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids in the absence of dietary fats.

Research has shown that emulsified forms of omega-3 supplements can significantly increase the absorption of EPA and DHA compared to non-emulsified forms, even when consumed in a fasted state or with low-fat or no-fat meals. For instance, a study demonstrated that a novel SMEDS formulation of omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a more than 6-fold increase in absorption compared to control conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of emulsification in enhancing bioavailability under various dietary conditions [1](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0589-0).

Additionally, other studies have corroborated these findings, indicating that emulsified fish oil supplements lead to enhanced absorption of omega-3 fatty acids compared to traditional capsular forms, without the need for a high-fat meal [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465191/) [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701654/). This makes emulsified omega-3 supplements particularly beneficial for individuals who are advised to limit their fat intake or find it inconvenient to coordinate their supplement intake with fatty meals.

In summary, emulsified omega-3 supplements are specifically formulated to improve the bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids without the necessity of accompanying fat intake, making them a convenient option for various dietary preferences and conditions [1](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0589-0) [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465191/)[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701654/).

#### Notes by Admin of VitaminDWiki Dec 2012

* Aroma of food is stored in the fat. 

* Certain fats are much more likely to go rancid than others and develop off flavors. 

* Animals tend to store excess energy in fat. 

* Linolenic acid in 10X less stable than linoleic acid: This form of Omega-3 has a short shelf life discovered 1952

* Israel is the top consumer (per person) of  **Linoleic acid**  in the world (30 grams), and have a high rate of heart attack, similar to the US, but with less meat.

* Greens are high in Omega-3

* Should have a low ratio of Omega-6 to Omega 3: US has a high ratio of 10,  Sweden has 5, Japan has only 2

> Japan has highest life expectancy AND highest Omega-3 consumption in the world (as well as a very high consumption of <a href="/posts/vitamin-k2" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 765">Vitamin K2</a>)

*  **PUFA**  was the only way to describe all Omegas until 1964

* Ratios in foods: Flaxseed oil 0.2, Canola 2, Walnut 5, Corn 46 

* Far less saturated fat in wild animals than domesticated (1968)

* Omega-3 reduced future heart attacks in Intervention clinical trials

> Intervention trial with 11,000 people who already had a heart attack. DHA and EPA 850 mg or placebo. 

> Within 3 years 45% fewer Sudden Deaths due to subsequent heart attacks. 

---

#### Additional thoughts from reading The Queen of Fats

* Omega-3 promoters encounter even more resistance than do Vitamin D3 promoters

> Economic resistance from the food industry (shelf life) only Omega-3, medical industry opposed to change: Omega-3 and D3

* Wonder – do Americans pay more on health care than they do on food? 

> Answer YES: 16% on health care and 10% on food - as % of disposable income  or % of GDP [Breakdown by income level](http://minneapolisfed.typepad.com/roundup/health-care/)

> 40 years ago the %s of O-3 and O-6 were almost reversed.

* The goal of eating a balanced diet without supplements no longer makes sense when our food is no longer balanced

#### Now I know why the recent Meta-analysis of Omega-3 did not find any reduction in heart deaths - 2018

Previous version of the [Cochrane analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019766)  had excluded all trials with **fewer than 50 deaths** 

This review looked at 2100 studies and excluded 90% of them

This review did not mention if they had continued that outrageous exclusion.

details in [Orthomolecular Nutrtion](http://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&chash=f4b9ec30ad9f68f89b29639786cb62ef.98&s=1a86af640e6320f7168d4d11d13a55c1)

I had wondered how the Cochrane Review could possibly have not found a benefit.

The reading of the paper did not indicate the reason. But now I have found out why.

I wonder how many other Cochrane  reviews are similarly biased by excluding studies which find a benefit

#### FDA battle against Omega-3  as a way to reduce cardiovascular risk - 2020

"On February 26, 1987, the FDA conducted an  **armed raid**  against Life Extension®

The FDA seized our fish oil and brochures describing fish oil’s potential to reduce cardiovascular risk.

We fought a multi-year legal battle that resulted in the government dismissing all charges against Life Extension®, marking the first time in the FDA’s 88-year history that it has been forced to give up on a criminal prosecution"

#### Rhonda Patrick podcast:  Unconventional effects of omega-3s - March 2022

 **[Must be a $5/month member to listen](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/dashboard/aliquot?episode=aliquot-52-unconventional-effects-omega3s)** 

The cardioprotective effects of omega-3s are pretty well established. But the research on omega-3s has also revealed that they're involved in nearly every aspect of human health, eliciting some unconventional effects that influence neurocognitive, immunological, and respiratory health, and lots more – throughout the lifespan.

In this Aliquot, we share a variety of segments from different interviews covering some of the unconventional effects of omega-3 fatty acids and how to overcome some of the roadblocks to obtaining these effects.

00:00:00 - Omega-3s support the brain, the immune system, and healthy aging

00:03:29 - Omega-3's in breastmilk support brain development

00:05:24 - Omega-3s slow epigenetic aging (Dr. Steve Horvath segment)

00:09:19 - EPA and DHA resolve inflammation

00:10:35 - Omega-3s in phospholipid form are better absorbed (discussion w/ Kevin Rose)

00:18:10 - Sources of phospholipid-bound omega-3s

00:26:23 - Rhonda's omega-3 intake

00:28:15 - Risks of omega-3 supplementation

00:30:28 - Is vegetarian ALA equivalent to marine EPA and DHA?
