Introduction Growing evidence documented the critical impacts of vitamin D (VD) in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The functions of VD are dependent on the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the VD/VDR signaling pathway. Therefore, we aimed to assess the association of VDR gene polymorphisms with COVID-19 outcomes. Methods In the present study, eight VDR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 500 COVID-19 patients in Iran, including 160 asymptomatic, 250 mild/moderate, and 90 severe/critical cases. The association of these polymorphisms with severity, clinical outcomes, and comorbidities were evaluated through the calculation of the Odds ratio (OR). Results Interestingly, significant associations were disclosed for some of the SNP-related alleles and/or genotypes in one or more genetic models with different clinical data in COVID-19 patients. Significant association of VDR-SNPs with signs, symptoms, and comorbidities was as follows: ApaI with shortness of breath (P ˂ 0.001) and asthma (P = 0.034) in severe/critical patients (group III); BsmI with chronic renal disease (P = 0.010) in mild/moderate patients (group II); Tru9I with vomiting (P = 0.031), shortness of breath (P = 0.04), and hypertension (P = 0.030); FokI with fever and hypertension (P = 0.027) in severe/critical patients (group III); CDX2 with shortness of breath (P = 0.022), hypertension (P = 0.036), and diabetes (P = 0.042) in severe/critical patients (group III); EcoRV with diabetes (P ˂ 0.001 and P = 0.045 in mild/moderate patients (group II) and severe/critical patients (group III), respectively). However, the association of VDR TaqI and BglI polymorphisms with clinical symptoms and comorbidities in COVID-19 patients was not significant. Conclusion VDR gene polymorphisms might play critical roles in the vulnerability to infection and severity of COVID-19, probably by altering the risk of comorbidities. However, these results require further validation in larger studies with different ethnicities and geographical regions.

##### Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses (clipped from PDF)

Univariate analysis showed that disease severity was associated with age (odds ration <span>[OR]</span>: 1.031, confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 1.015-1.047, p < .001, R2: 2.7%), lymphocyte count (OR: 0.998, CI: 0.997-0.998, p < .001, R2: 6.7%), ferritin (OR: 1.001, CI: 1.000-1.002, p < .001, R2: 7.9%), LDH (OR: 1.003, CI: 1.002-1.005, p < .001, R2: 8.5%), hs-CRP levels (OR: 1.016, CI: 1.012-1.019, p < .001, R2: 18.1%), procalcitonin (OR: 2.902, CI: 1.651-5.099, p <.001, R2: 8.7%), and also Fok I Ff genotype (OR: 3.172, CI: 1.182-8.511, p = .022, R2: 1.1%).

In univariate analysis,  **mortality was associated with the Apa I aa genotype (OR: 11.828** , CI: 2.493-56.104, p = .002, R2: 14.6%). Moreover, ICU admission was associated with theTaqI TT genotype (OR: 2.854, CI: 0.851-10.755, p = .005, R2: 3.8%).

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, hs-CRP (OR: 1.016), ApaI aa genotype ( **OR: 14.581** ) were found to be related to mortality (R2: 37.1%).

#### COVID death 11.8X more likely if poor VDR - Review Nov 2022

 **Vitamin D and polymorphisms of VDR and GC genes in the severity and mortality from COVID-19. A systematic review**

Previous studies have pointed to a possible relationship between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of the disease promoted by SARS-CoV-2, reducing respiratory and cardiovascular complications caused by a hyperreaction of the immune system known as "cytokine storm". This vitamin exerts multiple functions that depend on the presence and levels of different proteins, such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the vitamin D binding protein (DBP), and the existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes that encode these proteins. The objective of this review is to assess whether some VDR and GC SNPs are risk factors for the most severe forms of COVID-19 disease and whether they condition the response to vitamin D supplementation. A search was performed in PubMed, Google Scholar and Scielo, finding that genotypes in patients affected by COVID-19, were rarely performed, although some studies find a relationship between different alleles and the severity of the disease. The ApaI polymorphism of the VDR gene stands out, as the minor allele "a" increases the risk of mortality from COVID-19 (OR = 11.828, CI: 2,493-56,104, p = 0.002). Results divergency in the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation suggest the need for a larger number of studies. In conclusion, the study of VDR and GC polymorphisms seems essential to effectively treat vitamin D deficiency and particularly to protect against COVID-19. Well-designed studies are needed to elucidate whether plasma vitamin D levels play a role of casuality or causality.
