#### There are a wide variety of UV meters available

 **Unless they specificially say UVB (vitamin D), I assume that they measure/monitor UVA or UVA+UVB** 

 **In the middle of a clear sunny day UVA, UVA+UVB and UVB will all be related by a constant** 

 **However, the UVA/UVB ratio may change significantly with changes in** 

* clouds

* other time during the day

* season

* different UV bulbs

including many under $50 and some under $10

Doubt that any low-cost meters measure just UVB

UVB (Vitamin D) is measured- ignores UVA

They have a [spreadsheet](http://www.solarmeter.com/pdfs/vit_d_utility_x8.xls) which allows you to adjust for age, skin color, sunscreen, amount of skin exposed

Here is a great analysis of UVB lamps with this meter <span>[tiki-download_file.php?fileId=2183]</span>

[UV hawk is a tiny device](http://www.q3i.com/uvhawk_series_2.php) $30

Takes about 5 seconds to make a measurement. Probably UVA + UVB

One output is UV index

Second output is the % time remaining to be in the sun based on SPF of sunscreen and skin color

#### Chaney UV meter - another example (probably UVA+UVB)
