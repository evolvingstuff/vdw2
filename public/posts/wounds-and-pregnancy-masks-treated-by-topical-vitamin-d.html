#### Vitamin D and wound healing: Assessing skin barrier function and implications for chloasma treatment

Int Wound J 2024 Jan;21(1):e14541. [doi: 10.1111/iwj.14541.](https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.14541.)

Chloasma, which is distinguished by irregularities in the pigmentation of skin, poses substantial challenge in the field of dermatology. The regulatory influence of vitamin D on the functions of skin cells implies that it may have the capacity to effectively treat chloasma and promote wound healing. To assess the efficacy of vitamin D in chloasma treatment and its impact on the function of skin barrier during the process of wound healing. The research spanned from April 2022 to September 2023, in Shanghai, China, examined 480 individuals who had been diagnosed with chloasma.

#### Asked Perplexity AI about Chloasma - Jan 2024

 **The following does not include references, images, YouTube videos, etc** 

Chloasma, also known as melasma or the &quot;mask of pregnancy,&quot; is a skin pigmentation disorder characterized by the appearance of irregular brownish or blackish spots, primarily on the face. These spots are areas of hyperpigmentation, which refers to the darkening of the skin due to an increased deposition of melanin, the pigment that determines one&#39;s eye and skin color

.Chloasma is more common in individuals assigned female at birth and in individuals with darker skin tones. It is often associated with pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives, although the exact cause is not fully understood . Other contributing factors may include unprotected sun exposure, hormonal changes involving estrogen and progesterone, certain medications that increase the skin&#39;s sensitivity to sunlight, and a genetic predisposition

.During pregnancy, chloasma can affect 50-70% of pregnant women, presenting as symmetric hyperpigmented macules, primarily on the cheeks, the upper lip, the chin, and the forehead . The condition is also associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 

Despite the common association with hormonal changes, the exact mechanism by which pregnancy or hormonal changes affect the process of melanogenesis (the production of melanin) is unknown. The hyperpigmented patches can range in color from tan to deep brown and typically occur on both sides of the face in a nearly identical pattern. While the skin patches may not entirely disappear, they can become less noticeable over time. 

However, spontaneous resolution can be time-consuming and may take months to restore normal pigmentation. Prevention of chloasma primarily involves strict photoprotection, including measures to avoid sun exposure and the use of sunscreens containing physical blockers, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide . If the condition persists after pregnancy and breastfeeding, treatment options may include skin lightening creams, topical steroids, or laser treatments

!!!!Vitamin D and wound healing: Assessing skin barrier function and implications for chloasma treatment
Int Wound J 2024 Jan;21(1):e14541. doi: 10.1111/iwj.14541.

Chloasma, which is distinguished by irregularities in the pigmentation of skin, poses substantial challenge in the field of dermatology. The regulatory influence of vitamin D on the functions of skin cells implies that it may have the capacity to effectively treat chloasma and promote wound healing. To assess the efficacy of vitamin D in chloasma treatment and its impact on the function of skin barrier during the process of wound healing. The research spanned from April 2022 to September 2023, in Shanghai, China, examined 480 individuals who had been diagnosed with chloasma. A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was utilized to evaluate effectiveness of topical vitamin D3 in treatment of chloasma. Concurrently, randomized control trial investigated the effects of ingested vitamin D3 supplements on the process of wound healing. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), chloasma severity score changes, wound size reduction and skin hydration levels were critical performance indicators. Statistically, the severity scores of chloasma decreased significantly in the vitamin D treatment group at 3 and 6 months compared with the placebo (p &lt; 0.05). The Vitamin D group exhibited superior wound healing outcomes, including more substantial reduction in lesion size and enhanced skin barrier function, as evidenced by increased skin hydration and decreased TEWL (p &lt; 0.05). Vitamin D substantially mitigated the severity of chloasma and has beneficial effect on wound healing and integrity of the skin barrier. Based on the results obtained, vitamin D exhibited promise as a therapeutic intervention in the field of dermatology, specifically in treatment of chloasma and promotion of wound recovery.

!!!!Asked Perplexity AI about Chloasma - Jan 2024
__The following does not include references, images, YouTube videos, etc__

Chloasma, also known as melasma or the &quot;mask of pregnancy,&quot; is a skin pigmentation disorder characterized by the appearance of irregular brownish or blackish spots, primarily on the face. These spots are areas of hyperpigmentation, which refers to the darkening of the skin due to an increased deposition of melanin, the pigment that determines one&#39;s eye and skin color

.Chloasma is more common in individuals assigned female at birth and in individuals with darker skin tones. It is often associated with pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives, although the exact cause is not fully understood . Other contributing factors may include unprotected sun exposure, hormonal changes involving estrogen and progesterone, certain medications that increase the skin&#39;s sensitivity to sunlight, and a genetic predisposition

.During pregnancy, chloasma can affect 50-70% of pregnant women, presenting as symmetric hyperpigmented macules, primarily on the cheeks, the upper lip, the chin, and the forehead . The condition is also associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 

Despite the common association with hormonal changes, the exact mechanism by which pregnancy or hormonal changes affect the process of melanogenesis (the production of melanin) is unknown. The hyperpigmented patches can range in color from tan to deep brown and typically occur on both sides of the face in a nearly identical pattern. While the skin patches may not entirely disappear, they can become less noticeable over time. 

However, spontaneous resolution can be time-consuming and may take months to restore normal pigmentation. Prevention of chloasma primarily involves strict photoprotection, including measures to avoid sun exposure and the use of sunscreens containing physical blockers, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide . If the condition persists after pregnancy and breastfeeding, treatment options may include skin lightening creams, topical steroids, or laser treatments
