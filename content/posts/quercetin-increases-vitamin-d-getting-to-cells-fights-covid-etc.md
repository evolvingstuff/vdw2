**Several diseases have learned how to protect themselves by deactivating the Vitamin D receptor.  
Many viruses have learned how to deactivate portions of the immune system.  
COVID-19 and many autoimmune diseases are strongly associated with a poor Vitamin D Receptor.  
Suspect that COVID reduces the activation of the Vitamin D Receptor.  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps Long-Haul COVID is associated with the continued VDR deactivation.  
Many VDR supplements, such as Quescetin, vary in bio-availability by >10X.**
