**Arterial Stiffness and other cardiocascular problems have been proven to be reduced by supplementation by each of the nutrients which have decreased over the past 50 years.  I do not know which is "best". Perhaps they work synergistically.   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; I personally take Vitamin D + Vitamin K + Omega-3 + Magnesium.

#### Measure Arterial Velocity at home - $150 iPad (SW version: 3+), or iPhone (SW version: 4S+),Android  (SW version: 5.0+)

I purchased a product to go with my iPad to measure my Arterial Velocity. Clips on the finger and makes the measurement in about 1 minute. Seems to be supported by good science.  The iPad displays your realtive Arterial Velocity, etc.  I have the Arterial Velocity of a person who is 20 years younger (51 instead of my actual 71)
