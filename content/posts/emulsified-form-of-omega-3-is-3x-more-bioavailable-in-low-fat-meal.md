#### Emulsion form enhances absorption of omega-3 EPA and DHA - Dec 2019

 **[AquaCelle technology enhances absorption of omega-3 EPA and DHA, says recent study](https://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/omega-3/aquacelle-technology-enhances-absorption-omega-3-epa-and-dha-says-recent-study) Nutrional Outlook**

* “A recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition demonstrates that the  **patented self-micro-emulsifying delivery system**  (SMEDS) called AquaCelle (from Pharmako Biotechnologies, based in New South Wales, Australia) improves that absorption of omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. In the randomized, double-blind, participants were given a single 680 mg dose of omega-3 ethel esters (EE) containing 272 mg of EPA EE and 204 mg of DHA EE. One group took the omega-3 dose with SMEDS, and the other without (control).”

* “Results showed that combining the omega-3 EE with SMEDS caused instant and complete emulsification on addition to water, while the control fish oil did not emulsify. In subjects, the group taking fish oil with SMEDS experienced a 3.7 and 7.1-fold increase in omega-3 maximum plasma concentration and absorption, respectively, compared to placebo.”

#### You can double your Omega-3 intake for a long time - getting to a higher Omega-3 index more quickly

#### How much more bio-available is emulsified Omega-3? - Asked Chat-GPT Dec 2023

Emulsified Omega-3 supplements are believed to have higher bioavailability compared to standard Omega-3 supplements. Bioavailability refers to the extent and rate at which the active moiety (drug or metabolite) enters systemic circulation, thereby accessing the site of action.

The increased bioavailability of emulsified Omega-3 is attributed to the emulsification process itself. Emulsification breaks down the oil into smaller droplets, which can be more easily absorbed by the body. This is particularly helpful for Omega-3 fatty acids, which are otherwise not very water-soluble.

While the exact percentage of increased bioavailability can vary depending on the specific formulation and individual differences in digestion and metabolism, some studies suggest that emulsified forms of Omega-3 can be up to three times more bioavailable than non-emulsified forms. However, it's important to note that individual results can vary, and the overall effectiveness of a supplement also depends on other factors such as the dosage, the purity of the Omega-3, and the presence of other nutrients that may aid in absorption.

If you are considering an emulsified Omega-3 supplement, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable option for your specific health needs and to understand the potential benefits and limitations of such supplements.
