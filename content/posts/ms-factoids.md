### (Note:low vitamin D increases probability of MS which lowers vitamin D levels even more.  **<span style="color:#00F;">Vitamin D related items are marked in blue</span>** )

* First Diagnosed in 1849

* The earliest known description of a person with possible Multiple Sclerosis dates from 14th century Holland

* Multiple Sclerosis is the most common progressive and disabling neurological condition in young adults

* Approx 2.5 million people worldwide, have Multiple Sclerosis

* Around 400,000 people in the United States have Multiple Sclerosis

* In the UK, approx 70,000 people have the disease

* Approx 50,000 people in Canada have Multiple Sclerosis

* Scotland has the highest incidence of Multiple Sclerosis per head of population in the world <span style="color:#00F;">also have the lowest levels of vitamin D in the world</span>

> In Scotland, over 10,500 people have Multiple Sclerosis

* No virus has ever been isolated as the cause of Multiple Sclerosis

* Average age of clinical onset is 30 – 33 years of age

* The average age of diagnosis is 37 years of age

* The average time between clinical onset of MS and diagnosis by physicians is 4 - 5 years

* 10% of cases are diagnosed after the age of fifty

* In 1936, only 8% of patients were reported to survive beyond 20 years after onset of illness

* In 1961, over 80% of Multiple Sclerosis patients were reported surviving to 20 years after onset of illness

* 2002 – A patient with Multiple Sclerosis can expect to live to average population life-expectancy minus seven years (mean life expectancy - 7 years)

* Multiple Sclerosis is five times more prevalent in temperate climates than in tropical climates  <a href="/posts/span-stylecolor00fwell-known-latitudeuvbspan" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 691"><span style="color:#00F;">well known latitude/UVB</span></a>

* Multiple Sclerosis affects women much more frequently than men. Approx. 1.7 – 2:1 in the US and approx 3:2 in the UK <span style="color:#00F;">women have lower vitamin D levels than men</span>

* The ratio of white to non-white is approx 2:1

* Gypsies and Inuit's do get Multiple Sclerosis although the incidence rate is much lower than other populations at approx 19 per 100,000

* Native Indians of North and South America, the Japanese and other Asian peoples have a very low incidence rate of Multiple Sclerosis

* In identical twins where one twin develops the disease, the likelihood of the second twin developing Multiple Sclerosis is approx 30%

* The incidence rate for non-identical twins, where one contracts Multiple Sclerosis, is approx 4%

* The risk of contracting Multiple Sclerosis if a first-degree relative (father, mother, sibling) has the disease, is approx 1% - 3% overall

* The risk of contracting Multiple Sclerosis if your father has the disease is approx 1 in 100

* The risk of contracting Multiple Sclerosis if your mother has the disease is approx 1 in 50

* The risk among the general population of contracting Multiple Sclerosis is approx 1 in 800

# Multiple Sclerosis symptoms from same group

* The symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis may be mild or severe, chronic (long-term) or of short duration; may be transient (appear and disappear very quickly)

* Symptoms and signs may disappear or may fluctuate in character and intensity

* The sometimes bizarre and transient nature of symptoms may be mistaken for a psychiatric condition

* Approx. 40% of Multiple Sclerosis patients have Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS)

* Approx. 20% of Multiple Sclerosis patients will initially be diagnosed as having Benign Multiple Sclerosis

> Less than 5% - 10% of patients actually have benign Multiple Sclerosis

* 55% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis will develop optic neuritis at some time or other during their lifetime. 45% of patients do not

* Approximately 5% - 10% of Multiple Sclerosis patients experience trigeminal neuralgia (tic delaroux) at some stage during the course of the disease

* Only 15% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis will have optic neuritis as a first symptom. 85% will present to their physician with a different symptom

* Between 20% - 40% of women with Multiple Sclerosis have a relapse within the 3 months post partum (after giving birth) <a href="/posts/span-stylecolor00fvitamin-d-levels-are-lowest-after-birthspan" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 816"><span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D levels are lowest after birth</span></a>

* Complete or partial remission of symptoms will occur in approx 70% of patients, particularly during the early stages of the disease

* Males have a higher tendency to develop Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS)

* Females tend to experience more relapses than men

* 5% of Multiple Sclerosis patients exhibit an inappropriate euphoria

* Approx 50% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis experience cognitive impairment such as difficulty with concentration, attention, memory and poor judgment <a href="/posts/span-stylecolor00flow-cognition-is-associated-with-low-vitamin-dspan" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 584"><span style="color:#00F;">Low cognition is associated with low vitamin D</span></a>

* Approx 50% of Multiple Sclerosis patients will suffer some form of mental disturbance such as depression, mild dementia or organic psychosis

* 2/3 of patients with Multiple Sclerosis will develop disturbance of sphincter control at some stage during the course of the disease

* The major bowel complaint is constipation although fecal incontinence may occur occasionally in some patients

* Depression is common and unrelated to cognitive impairment although it may worsen existing cognitive difficulties [<span style="color:#00F;">SAD is associated with low level of vitamin D</span>](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=48&sort_mode=created_desc)

* Approx 10% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis will suffer severe psychotic disorders such as Manic Depression (Bipolar Disorder) and paranoia

* In approx 80% of Multiple Sclerosis sufferers, heat will cause a temporary worsening of symptoms (Uhthoff's Phenomenon). 

> The heat source may be externally produced, for example, a hot bath; or the result of physical exertion. 

> Removal of the heat source / cooling normally, though not always, eliminates the problem, although this can take from a few minutes to several hours.

* 60% of neurological signs experienced during hyperthermia (i.e. Uhthoff's phenomenon) are new to the patient.

* Some heat sensitive patients find a cool bath or swimming temporarily relieves some symptoms

* Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients develop, on average, 20 new lesions per year and will have between 1 – 2 exacerbations per year

* For every 8 – 10 new lesions shown by MRI, only 1 clinical manifestation (measurable exacerbation) will occur

* Patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis have a higher incidence of spinal cord lesion and exhibit much more rapid development of disability than those with other forms of the disease

* 1 in every 4, or 25%, of exacerbations are associated with a viral infection

* Approx 75% - 85% of patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) will go on to develop Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS)

* Approx 80% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis experience fatigue  Vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with <a href="/posts/fatigue" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 383">Fatigue</a>

* Spasticity will occur in approx 60% of patients with a progressive form of the disease

* 80% - 90% of men and 45% - 70% of women will report some form of sexual dysfunction

* Patients with Multiple Sclerosis have a greater risk of seizure than in the general population <a href="/posts/span-stylecolor00fseizures-are-associated-with-low-level-of-vitamin-dspan" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 661"><span style="color:#00F;">Seizures are associated with low level of vitamin D</span></a>

* Lesions may occur in the Corpus Callosum, an area of the brain thought to be involved in seizures

* Exercises or physical therapy designed to stretch the muscles, particularly those of the leg, can help prevent contractures, an irreversible shortening of muscles.
