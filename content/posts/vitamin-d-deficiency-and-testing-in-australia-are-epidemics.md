~Highlights from [Sidney Morning Herald Aug 2011](http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/experts-at-odds-on-vitamin-d-tests-for-pregnant-women-20110802-1i9lp.html)

* 2010: nearly 3 million tests for levels of vitamin D  costing Australia almost $100 million.

* The number has grown more than  **50-fold in a decade**  - and has  **<span style="color:#00F;">doubled in just two years </span>** 

* Screening during pregnancy could add 300,000 to the total.

# They are considering vitamin D testing for all pregnancies - but they see a large direct cost, but not the huge cost savings

## It would be far less expensive and far better for the women to just have them take about 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily
