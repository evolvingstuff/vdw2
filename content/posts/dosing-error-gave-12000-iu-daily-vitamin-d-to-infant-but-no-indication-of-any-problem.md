#### Dosing Error With Over-the-Counter Vitamin D Supplement: A Risk for Vitamin D Toxicity in Infants.

Clin Pediatr (Phila). 2012 Apr 5. 

Rajakumar K, Reis EC, Holick MF.

Instead of 400 IU an infant was given 12,000 IU of vitamin D daily for 20 days

Due to parents giving 1 mil liter as they were used to instead of 1 drop, from the new product 

Authors were extremely concerned about infant toxicity

However, no problems at all:

Small excerpt from the paper

^The infant was clinically stable with no symptoms and was feeding and acting well. 

The infant had no history of irritability, constipation, or abnormal movements. Examination revealed a calm, alert, well-appearing infant (weight 5.6 kg; 3rd-15th World Health Organization percentile) with no focal findings except slightly increased patellar deep tendon reflexes; no clonus was present. Serum calcium (10.5 mg/dL, reference range 8.8-10.8 mg/dL), phosphorus (6.4 mg/dL, reference range 4.5-6.5 mg/dL), electrolyte panel, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen were normal.^

20 days at 12,000 IU per day = 240,000 IU

Blood level was 400 ng/ml, which dropped down naturally to 50ng in 4 months

There continues to be is so much fear from vitamin D toxicity â€“ even with decades of experience around the world with very young humans and other mammals with very high levels of vitamin D
