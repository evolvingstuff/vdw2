#### Free Vitamin D 3 Index and Vitamin D-binding protein in multiple sclerosis - a presymptomatic case-control study - May 2022

Background: High levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25<span>[OH]</span>D3 ) is associated with a lower risk for multiple sclerosis (MS). The bioavailability of 25(OH)D3 is regulated by its main plasma carrier, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). Free 25(OH)D3 can be estimated by also measuring DBP concentration. In addition, DBP has immunomodulatory functions that may independently affect MS pathogenesis. No previous studies have assessed free 25(OH)D3 or DBP in presymptomatically collected samples.

Objective: To assess free 25(OH)D3 and DBP as risk factors for MS.

Methods: A nested case-control study was performed with presymptomatic serum samples identified through cross-linkage of MS registries and Swedish biobanks. Concentration of 25(OH)D3 was measured with liquid chromatography and DBP levels with sandwich immunoassay. Free 25(OH)D3 was approximated as Free Vitamin D3 Index: (25<span>[OH]</span>D3 /DBP)×103 . MS risk was analysed by conditional logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results: Serum samples from 660 pairs of matched cases and controls were included. Below 20 years of age, high levels of Free Vitamin D3 Index were associated with a lower risk of MS (highest vs lowest quintile: OR=0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.91, p for trend across quintiles 0.04). At age 30-39, high levels of DBP were associated with a lower MS risk (highest vs lowest quintile:  **OR=0.36** , 95% CI 0.15-0.85, p for trend 0.02).

Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that high levels of free 25(OH)D3 at a young age reduces the risk of MS later in life. They also implicate a role for DBP in MS aetiology.

#### Another MS and binding study - June 2023

 **Association of Blood Levels of Vitamin D and Its Binding Protein with Clinical Phenotypes of Multiple Sclerosis** 

Biomedicines . 2023 Jun 24;11(7):1808. [doi: 10.3390/biomedicines11071808.](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11071808.)

Background: Low vitamin D levels may synergize with changing levels of the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) to precipitate in the development and clinical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, this hypothesis was explored in groups of Kuwaiti healthy controls and patients with different clinical phenotypes of MS.

Methods: Fasting serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and DBP were measured in 146 healthy controls and 195 patients with MS. The latter were classified according to the duration, type, and onset of the disease and the mode of treatment. Factors such as relapse/remitting, and the use of nutritional supplements were also considered.

Results: The DBP levels were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls. This was more evident in newly diagnosed drug-naïve patients than in those patients with more established MS. MS status and severity were negatively impacted by concurrently low levels of 25(OH)D and DBP. This was most clearly expressed in drug-naïve patients and in those with a disease in relapse. It was also established that the 25(OH)D level had a significant positive correlation with the duration of the disease.

Conclusion: Lower levels of 25(OH)D and DBP appear to have a synergistic effect on MS status. This was most clearly demonstrated in patients who were newly diagnosed (drug-naïve) and in those patients who were in relapse.
