#### Omega-3 and enveloped virus such as COVID-19 - Feb 2021

 **Correlation between bioactive lipids and novel coronavirus: constructive role of biolipids in curbing infectivity by enveloped viruses, centralizing on EPA and DHA**

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the family coronaviridae. It is spherical and possesses proteins called spikes, which can clamp onto the human cells. Once in close interaction with the human cells, these viruses undergo structural change and can fuse with the cell membrane. The virus enters the host and starts the process of translation and transcription in the cells and uncoated genome, respectively. Due to the rapid transmittable nature of the virus, extant actions should be taken. The fatty acids administrated orally, or intravenously, could help us gear things up in providing resistance and preventing infection. Hence, the multiplication of the virus could be hindered by arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In that context, the current review highlights the role of these unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives such as lipoxins and resolvins in the inactivation of the enveloped coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The rapid international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a global health emergency in 2020. It has affected over 52 million people and led to over 1.29 million deaths worldwide, as of November 13 th, 2020. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 present with symptoms ranging from none to severe and include fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, anosmia, and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Severe complications are largely due to overdrive of the host immune system leading to “cytokine storm”. This results in disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death. Due to its highly infectious nature and concerning mortality rate, every effort has been focused on prevention and creating new medications or repurposing old treatment options to ameliorate the suffering of COVID-19 patients including the immune dysregulation. Omega-3 fatty acids are known to be incorporated throughout the body into the bi-phospholipid layer of the cell membrane leading to the production of less pro-inflammatory mediators compared to other fatty acids that are more prevalent in the Western diet. In this article, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, including their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, and possible antiviral effects have been discussed.

#### COVID 4X less likely if High Omega-3 (small observation test) - Jan 2021

 **Blood omega-3 fatty acids and death from COVID-19: A pilot study** 

Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids . 2021 Mar;166:102250. [doi: 10.1016/j.plefa.2021.102250](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plefa.2021.102250)

Very-long chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. We conducted a pilot study in  **100 patients to test the hypothesis**  that RBC EPA+DHA levels (the Omega-3 Index, O3I) would be inversely associated with risk for death by analyzing the O3I in banked blood samples drawn at hospital admission. Fourteen patients died, one of 25 in quartile 4 (Q4) (O3I ≥5.7%) and 13 of 75 in Q1-3. After adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for death in patients with an O3I in Q4 vs Q1-3 was  **0.25,**  p = 0.07. Although not meeting the classical criteria for statistical significance, this strong trend suggests that a relationship may indeed exist, but more well-powered studies are clearly needed.
