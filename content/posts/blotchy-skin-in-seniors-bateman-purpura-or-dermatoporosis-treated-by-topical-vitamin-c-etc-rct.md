Background

Bateman purpura is characterized by diffuse senile skin atrophy, senile purpura and spontaneous stellar pseudo-cicatrices.  **Cutaneous changes in the course of aging have been related to lower levels of ascorbic acid into the dermis of elderly people.** 

Objective

In the present study, we postulate that senile purpura could be linked to dermal vitamin C deficiency and could be corrected by topical administration of this vitamin.

Methods

A 12-weeks, hemi-member (forearm or leg), randomized double-blind comparative study, was conducted in 18 patients with Bateman purpura aged over than 60 years. At each visit, clinical assessment and biometrological measurements were performed. Clinical examination and scoring by experts showed a significant improvement on the vitamin C-treated side compared with the control, with reduction of hemorrhage areas, increase of dermal thickness.

Results

Twice-daily application of 5% topical vitamin C led to a clinically apparent improvement of the skin symptoms and allows beneficial effects on skin elasticity and thickness. Bateman purpura, a classical sign of photoaging whose origin has not clearly been recognized could be improved by vitamin C applied on to the skin.

Conclusion

These results confirm the hypothesis of underlying of role vitamin C deficiency in the determinism of Bateman purpura.
