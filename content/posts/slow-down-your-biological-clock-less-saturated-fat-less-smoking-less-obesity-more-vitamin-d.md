#### Exploring the Relationships between Lifestyle Patterns and Epigenetic Biological Age Measures in Men

Biomedicines. 2024 Sep 2;12(9):1985. [doi: 10.3390/biomedicines12091985.](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12091985.)

DNA methylation, validated as a surrogate for biological age, is a potential tool for predicting future morbidity and mortality outcomes. This study aims to explore how lifestyle patterns are associated with epigenetic changes in British men. Five biological age clocks were utilised to investigate the relationship between these epigenetic markers and lifestyle-related factors in a prospective study involving 221 participants. Spearman's correlation test, Pearson's correlation test, and univariate linear regression were employed for analysis. The results indicate that higher consumption of saturated fat and total daily calories, and a higher body mass index (BMI) are associated with accelerated biological aging. 

Conversely, higher vitamin D intake and a higher healthy lifestyle index (HLI) are linked to decelerated biological aging. These findings highlight the potential impact of specific lifestyle-related factors on biological aging and can serve as a reference for applying healthy lifestyle improvements in future disease prevention studies.
