OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D insufficiency is prevalent in various populations worldwide but with scarce data on physically active individuals. Vitamin D is important to athletes, affecting bone mass, immunity, and physical performance. This study evaluated the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency among young athletes and dancers.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.

SETTING: Sport medicine clinic.

PATIENTS: Data on 98 athletes and dancers (age, 14.7 +/- 3.0 years; range, 10-30 years; 53% men), who had undergone screening medical evaluations, were extracted from medical records. INDEPENDENT VARIABLE:: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, age, sex, sport discipline, month of blood test, and serum ferritin. 

Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D concentration <30 ng/mL.

RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 25.3 +/- 8.3 ng/mL. 

Seventy-three percent of participants were vitamin D insufficient. 

Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was higher among 

* dancers (94%), 

* basketball players (94%), and 

* Tae Kwon Do fighters (67%) and among athletes from 

* i<span style="color:#F00;">ndoor versus outdoor sports (80% vs 48%;</span> P = 0.002). 

25(OH)D levels adjusted for age and sex correlated with serum ferritin and season.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, conducted among young athletes and dancers from various disciplines in a sunny country, a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was identified.  **A higher rate of vitamin D insufficiency was found among participants who practice indoors, during the winter months, and in the presence of iron depletion** . Given the importance of vitamin D to athletes for several reasons, we suggest that athletes and dancers be screened for vitamin D insufficiency and treated as needed. PMID: 20818195
