Vitamin D enhances many chemotherapies

For some chemo, less is needed if higher vitamin D

1. Then, if less chemo is given the body will not be stressed as much

1. However, if same dose of chemo is given with higher Vitamin D the patient might die

#### Vitamin D has been shown to enhance many types of Chemotherapies

So, be careful about taking vitamin D IF your doctor is unwilling to reduce the amount of chemo to be given.

Chemo dosages were established for the majority of people who have low levels of vitamin D in their blood.

It appears that if you take the normal Chemo dose AND a good level of vitamin D in your blood you will get 2X the impact.

The impact varies with the type of Chemo, suggest that you search [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) for "name of chemo" "Vitamin D"

 **Update 2017 by Founder of VitaminDWiki** 

A friend of mine got Lung Cancer

I told him it was great to take extra vitamin D, PROVIDED the standard Chemo dosing was reduced as needed.

Unfortunately, the doctors did not adjust his dose until they finally noticed he had so few white blood cells that they could not even be measured.  He dies

#### Paclitaxel chemotherapy cause pains if low vitamin D, need less Paclitaxel if higher D – Sept 2024

 **The correlation between vitamin D and the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy induced by paclitaxel chemotherapy** 

Front Med (Lausanne). 2024 Sep 24:11:1466049. [doi: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1466049](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2024.1466049)

Jialei Zhang 1, Xiaoling Zhang 2 3, Jie Wu 1

Introduction: Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for various cancers, induces peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) in approximately 80% of patients, severely affecting their quality of life. The role of vitamin D in pain perception has gained attention, but its correlation with PIPN remains unclear.

Methods: This study included 129 cancer patients who received adjuvant paclitaxel chemotherapy from January to June 2023. Neuropathic pain was assessed using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (DN4) questionnaire, and serum levels of vitamin D and glutathione (GSH) were measured to explore the correlation between vitamin D levels and neuropathic pain induced by paclitaxel chemotherapy.

Results: The results showed a negative correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the occurrence of neuropathic pain (Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.324, P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the area under the vitamin D curve for neuropathic pain was 0.681. Furthermore, after paclitaxel chemotherapy, there was a significant decrease in GSH levels in the serum of patients, with a more pronounced decline in the vitamin D-deficient group.

Discussion: The findings of this study indicate that higher levels of vitamin D are negatively associated with the occurrence of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, suggesting that vitamin D might protect against oxidative stress. This discovery is significant for clinical treatment as it may help physicians better understand the mechanisms of pain during paclitaxel therapy and provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of such pain. It also suggests that modulating vitamin D levels could reduce the neurotoxicity of paclitaxel, thereby improving patients' quality of life and treatment compliance.

#### Update - Nov 2017

Googled: chemotherapy "vitamin d" - first entry is this VitaminDWiki page

---

Antioxidant supplements such as co enzyme Q10, selenium and the vitamins A, C and E can help to prevent cell damage

- VitaminDWiki comment - so Chemo doctors recommend NOT taking them!!

---

Treatment can last for anywhere from 3 to 6 months. During that time, you would be considered to be immunocompromised — not as able to fight infection. After finishing chemotherapy treatment, it can take anywhere from about 21 to 28 days for your immune system to recover.

http://www.breastcancer.org/tips/immune/cancer/chemo 

- VitaminDWiki Comment: Even if you wait until chemo is done Vitamin D can probably help the immune system recover

---

Oct 2, 2008 - The odds of having severe vitamin D deficiency (25-OH vitamin D≤15 ng/ml) in a patient receiving chemotherapy was fourfold higher than a patient with colorectal cancer who never received chemotherapy or completed chemotherapy at least 3 months prior to their vitamin D assay.

---

- ‎2017 - In the patients who received chemotherapy (45% ), those with sufficient vitamin D levels had a statistically longer survival than those with deficient levels (p<0.002). Also the patients with sufficient levels, they were more likely to complete the 6 months of chemotherapy than those with deficient levels (p<0.006)

* In a laboratory study, vitamin D3 was found to increase breast cancer cell death caused by radiotherapy from approximately 30% to 75%.

* A 2016 study of 1,666 women in California found that higher levels of vitamin D at diagnosis were associated with improved survival, especially among premenopausal women.

* A prospective study which used stored blood of breast cancer patients to measure Vitamin D levels found that women with deficient vitamin D levels had a significantly increased risk of distant recurrence and death compared with those with sufficient levels. The authors concluded that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer.

[Cheno is a huge source of revenue to bigpharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy#Sales) Wikipedia

- VitaminDWiki comment -A patient needing less Chemo (due to Vitamin D) results in: 

* less income for the hospital: which is a function of cost of chemo and reduced days in hospital

* Doctors/hospitals also get a large income from use of Chem drugs - they buy wholesale but bill retail

> Thus often getting an additional income of $2,000/patient/month

> We can anticipate lots of resistance to reducing chemo dose sizes as a result of having a good level of Vitamin D

#### VitaminDWiki recommends considering gut-friendly forms of vitamin D during chemotherapy

#### Stock up on Vitamin D before surgery or at least before Chemo (provided doctor adjusts the chemo/radiation doses)

For many people [400,000 IU of vitamin D will be sufficient to get a good level](/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d) (Some will need 2X or 3X more)

#### What if a chemo drug is amplfied by Vitamin D more than 2X?

Note: Currently no chemo drug is known to be amplified by vitamin D by more than 2X

But, if chemo dose for the drug is reduced by only 2X the resulting chemo drug + Vitamin D could potentially be deadly

Wonder if there is any data on Vitamin D levels when taking many chemo drugs
