Without Vitamin D, our bodies cannot effectively absorb calcium, which is essential to good bone health.</h2><p><a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00567">http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00567</a></p><p>Children who lack Vitamin D develop the condition called rickets, which causes bone weakness, bowed legs, and other skeletal deformities, such as stooped posture.</p><p>Today, doctors are seeing an increase in the number of children with rickets. This article focuses on the reasons for the increase, and things parents can do to improve their children&rsquo;s bone health — as well as their own.</p><h2 id=what-is-vitamin-d-all-about>What is Vitamin D all about?</h2><p>Vitamin D is really not a vitamin. Vitamins are special nutrients that the body needs but cannot make, so they must be obtained from what we eat or by supplements. Because our bodies can make Vitamin D in our skin when it is exposed to good sunlight, Vitamin D is considered a hormone.</p><h2 id=how-much-vitamin-d-does-the-skin-make>How much Vitamin D does the skin make?</h2><p>Our skin makes a lot of Vitamin D when we spend time in strong sunlight. With about 5-30 minutes of sunlight exposure of head, face, hands, arms, or legs), our skin can make about 1000 IUs of Vitamin D (Vitamin D is measured in units called &ldquo;International Units,&rdquo; or IUs.) Vitamin D is therefore known as &ldquo;the sunshine vitamin.&rdquo;</p><p>If it is that easy for our bodies to make Vitamin D — at least during the sunny summer months - then why aren&rsquo;t people getting enough of it? Studies show that almost 50% of people in the U.S. – even in Florida – are low in Vitamin D.</p><p>Many things affect how much Vitamin D the skin makes.</p><p>For example, anything that affects the strength of sunlight reaching the skin can change the amount of vitamin the skin makes, including:</p><ul><li><p>The time of day</p></li><li><p>Season of the year</p></li><li><p>How far north you are</p></li><li><p>The amount of smog in the air</p></li><li><p>How much of your skin is covered with clothes</p></li><li><p>The shade of your skin. Darker skin requires more sun to make a given amount of Vitamin D</p></li><li><p>Sunscreen use. Sunscreen not only prevents sunburn and skin damage, it also can stop the skin from making Vitamin D</p></li></ul><h2 id=how-did-we-learn-about-vitamin-d-and-its-importance>How did we learn about Vitamin D and its importance?</h2><p>When our ancestors stopped working in the fields and entered factories or schools, rickets began to be a problem—in fact, it was commonly seen during winter months, especially in northern locations.</p><p>In about 1920, people noticed that children who took cod liver oil rarely got rickets.</p><p>This led to the discovery of Vitamin D and the beginning of Vitamin D supplementation of the diet.</p><p>Today, we are still learning about the different ways our bodies use Vitamin D, and how much of it we need every day — not just to prevent rickets, but for overall bone health.</p><h2 id=why-is-there-an-increase-in-rickets-today>Why is there an increase in rickets today?</h2><p>Many aspects of modern-day childhood impact Vitamin D intake.</p><ul><li><p>Children today spend hours in front of a computer or a television, rather than playing outside in the sun.</p></li><li><p>Few children walk to school on a regular basis.</p></li><li><p>Many popular sports, such as basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics, are indoor sports.</p></li><li><p>Sunscreen use has been vigorously promoted and has become common.</p></li><li><p>Milk intake by children has steadily decreased in favor of soda or juice.</p></li></ul><p>For these reasons and others, we are seeing rickets again.</p><p>Many children today do not get enough Vitamin D, even those living in sunny climates.</p><h2 id=how-much-vitamin-d-do-we-need>How much Vitamin D do we need?</h2><p>The government&rsquo;s recommendation from 1997 until 2008 was that 200 IU of Vitamin D would prevent rickets in most children.</p><p>New research resulted in doubling that recommendation in 2008, from 200 to 400 IU of Vitamin D.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has recently increased the daily recommended dose of Vitamin D in children to 400 IU, as well.</p><p>This is the amount that seems to prevent rickets, not the amount that will result in the healthiest bones.</p><p>Recent research supports that the body needs at least 1000 IU per day for good health — depending on age, weight, and growth.</p><p>Indeed, many people need much more than 1000 IU to keep Vitamin D levels in a good range.</p><p>In general, babies (especially those who are breastfeeding) and small children should intake at least 400 IU of Vitamin D daily.</p><p><strong>Children over age 5, adolescents, and adults should get a minimum of 1000 IU</strong> of Vitamin D each day.</p><h2 id=what-are-food-sources-of-vitamin-d>What are food sources of Vitamin D?</h2><p>Not many foods naturally contain Vitamin D—it is found in substantial levels only in fish.</p><p>Some foods have Vitamin D added to them (&ldquo;fortification&rdquo;).</p><p>For example, milk is fortified, but an 8 ounce glass of milk provides only 100 IU of Vitamin D.</p><p>Some other foods, like breakfast cereal, are fortified, but at very low levels.</p><p>Eggs can have small amounts of Vitamin D if the chicken was fed the vitamin.</p><p>Other dairy products — such as yogurt and cheese — are typically not fortified with Vitamin D.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-make-sure-my-child-gets-enough-vitamin-d>How do I make sure my child gets enough Vitamin D?</h2><p>To get 1000 IU of Vitamin D every day, a child needs to do one of the following:</p><ul><li><p>Be outside between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. for an average of 15 minutes every day with arms and legs exposed without sunscreen in a sunny climate (in Boston or farther north during the winter, being outside all day is not enough sunshine)</p></li><li><p>Eat fish every day</p></li><li><p>Drink 10 glasses of Vitamin D fortified milk each day</p></li><li><p>Take Vitamin D supplements</p></li></ul><h2 id=what-supplements-should-i-give-my-children>What supplements should I give my children?</h2><p><strong>Because most children do not eat fish every day or drink 10 glasses of milk, they must take a Vitamin D supplement to get enough of the vitamin, at least in the winter time</strong> .</p><p>Children&rsquo;s multivitamins contain between 60 and 400 IU of Vitamin D.</p><p>Taking several multivitamins each day to get more Vitamin D is not a good idea, because too much of other vitamins (such as Vitamin A) can be bad for bone.</p><p>Vitamin D is now readily available by itself in child-friendly forms, such as gummy vitamins or liquid.</p><p>Unlike calcium supplements, which are not absorbed if taken in doses greater than 500 mg at one time, Vitamin D can be taken all at once, so it need be given only once daily.</p><p>Do some children have special Vitamin D requirements?</p><p>Some children need extra Vitamin D to maintain good bone health.</p><p>These children should have their Vitamin D levels regularly checked, if possible.</p><p>Low Vitamin D levels can be easily treated by your pediatrician.</p><ul><li><p>Obese children. Heavier children require extra Vitamin D. This is because Vitamin D goes straight to body fat and accumulates there. The more fat tissue the body has, the less Vitamin D there is in the bloodstream where it is needed. So, obese children are prone to low Vitamin D levels and need extra Vitamin D intake.</p></li><li><p>Children who are prone to seizures. Medicines that are taken to prevent or treat seizures increase the body&rsquo;s need for Vitamin D, so children who take anti-seizure medicines must increase their daily Vitamin D intake.</p></li><li><p>Children with disabilities. Children who use wheelchairs or have chronic illnesses often do not play outside in the sun and should take Vitamin D.</p></li></ul><h2 id=how-do-doctors-test-vitamin-d-levels>How do doctors test Vitamin D levels?</h2><p>The best way to know a person&rsquo;s Vitamin D status is to have a blood test which checks the level in the blood.</p><p>It is important that the correct blood test is done: the &ldquo;25 hydroxy Vitamin D test&rdquo; shows the level in the blood from both diet and sunlight.</p><p>When your doctor knows the exact level of Vitamin D in your bloodstream, he or she can make a more accurate recommendation of how much Vitamin D to take.</p><p>A blood level less than 20 ng/mL can result in rickets, and more than 150 ng/mL can be harmful.</p><p>Most experts suggest that blood levels between 40 and 100 ng/mL would not only prevent rickets, but result in good absorption of calcium for healthy bones.</p><h2 id=can-we-overdo-vitamin-d>Can we overdo Vitamin D?</h2><p>Our skin cannot make too much Vitamin D — it stops when there is enough in the blood —but it is possible to overdose on Vitamin D supplements.</p><p>Because too much Vitamin D can be harmful, doses greater than 2000 IU/day should be taken cautiously, as advised by your doctor and based upon the results of blood tests.</p><h2 id=does-vitamin-d-do-more-than-help-us-absorb-calcium>Does Vitamin D do more than help us absorb calcium?</h2><p>Vitamin D is important for good muscle health. People with very low Vitamin D blood levels may be more likely to experience muscle cramps, bone, or joint pain.</p><p>Studies suggest that older people who take Vitamin D seem to fall less often, probably due to better muscle function.</p><p>Vitamin D is very important in many aspects of our health. Children and adults alike should enjoy outdoor activities, eat Vitamin D-rich foods, such as milk and fish, and take Vitamin D supplements to enjoy good bone health and the other benefits of the sunshine vitamin!</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
