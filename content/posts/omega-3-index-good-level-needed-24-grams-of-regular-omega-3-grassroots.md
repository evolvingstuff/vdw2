#### [How much omega-3 is needed to achieve an Omega-3 Index level of 8.0% or higher?](http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102722411090&ca=30a1939b-6370-4734-9b69-b2bcd9b4a99a)

* "Here are some results from the Omega-3 Index testing of 700+ participants.  Please take a look at the dose-response curve. You can note that if the target index level is 8%, fully 90% of the population could achieve that level with 2400 mg/day.  This is a higher intake than most supplement manufacturers put as a recommended dose.  That is, of course, why we do the dose-response curves.  The curve is also a straight line in this region."
