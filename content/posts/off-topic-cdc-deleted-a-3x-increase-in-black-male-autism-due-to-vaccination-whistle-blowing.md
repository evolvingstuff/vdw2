### [CDC: You’re Fired. Autism Coverup Exposed](http://kellybroganmd.com/article/cdc-youre-fired-autism-coverup-exposed/)

 **Clips** 

After Dr. Brian Hooker’s requests through the Freedom of Information Act for original MMR study documentation, a CDC Immunization Safety Researcher, Dr. William Thompson has buckled under the pressure of his conscience, and come forth as a whistle blower. 

These documents demonstrated a  **340% increase in the incidence of autism in African American boys, expunged from the final study results in a violent act of scientific fraud** .  In response to this now recovered letter from Dr. Thompson addressing this finding, the CDC retroactively altered the data to eliminate the signal of harm.

#### <span style="color:#F00;">There were likely similar increases in autism in MMR vaccinated infants who were also vitamin D deficient</span>

 **Example reasons for low infant vitamin D** 

* [pre-term birth](/posts/vitamin-d-webinar-cost-of-pre-term-birth-etc-baggerly), 

* [breastfed without Vitamin D supplementation](/posts/breastfed-infants-90-percent-had-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d-formula-fed-15-percent), 

* Mother did not supplement with vitamin D while pregnant

* Closely-spaced pregnancy

* Pregnant while get little sunshine: shut-in, far away from equator, birth in winter or spring,
