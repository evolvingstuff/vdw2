#### Higher risk of ACL problems if low vitamin D – April 2025

 **Effect of vitamin D on anterior cruciate ligament injury rates and post‐reconstruction function—A systematic review** 

J Exp Orthop. 2025;12:e70224.https://doi.org/10.1002/jeo2.70224 

Purpose: This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between serum vitamin D levels and key outcomes following anterior cru-ciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), including ACL injury risk, post-operative muscle recovery and post‐reconstruction functional outcomes.

Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search across ﬁve databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science) until July 2024. Studies were selected based on speciﬁc inclusion criteria, such as studies evaluating the relationship between vitamin D and injury risk, ACLR outcomes and muscle strength. Risk of bias was assessed using the MINORS tool, and results were synthesized narratively due to study heterogeneity.

Results: Five studies with 656,243 participants met the inclusion criteria. Most studies reported that low vitamin D levels were associated with a signiﬁcantly increased risk of ACL injuries and poorer postoperative muscle strength recovery. However, evidence regarding bone health and functional outcomes was inconsistent. No meta‐analysis was conducted due to the variability of study designs and outcomes, but qualitative synthesis indicated a potential protective role of vitamin D in ACL recovery.

Conclusions: Vitamin D deﬁciency appears to increase the risk of ACL injury and impede muscle recovery post‐surgery. However, limitationsinclude a high risk of bias and inconsistent evidence on functional out-comes, underscoring the need for further research

#### A Diagnosis of Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased Rates of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears and Reconstruction Failure - April 2023

Arthroscopy. 2023 Apr 29;S0749-8063(23)00375-4. [doi: 10.1016/j.arthro.2023.04.011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2023.04.011) &nbsp;PDF behind paywall

Purpose: This study aims to characterize the association between a diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D and primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR), and revision ACLR in different sex and age cohorts.

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study of the PearlDiver claims database, records were queried between January 1st, 2011 to October 31st, 2018 for all patients aged 10 to 59 who received a diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Rates of primary ACL tears, primary reconstruction, and revision reconstruction were calculated for sex- and age-specific cohorts and compared to a control of patients without a diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Incidence rates for primary ACL injuries were calculated, and multivariable logistic regression was used to compare rates of ACL injury, primary reconstruction, and revision reconstruction while controlling for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and several other comorbidities.

Results: Among the 328,011 patients (mean age 41.9 ± 12.6 years, 65.8% female) included in both the hypovitaminosis D and control cohorts, the incidence of ACL tears was 115.2 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 107.2 - 123.7), compared to 61.0 (95% CI, 55.2 - 67.2) in the demographics and comorbidity matched control cohort. 

The study cohort was significantly more likely to suffer an ACL tear over a 

* one- (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI, 1.41 - 1.99, p < 0.001) and

*  **two-year (aOR = 1.81** , 95% CI, 1.59 - 2.06, p < 0.001) period. 

This trend remained for both males at the one- (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI, 1.29 - 2.14, p < 0.001) and two-year (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.37 - 2.06, p < 0.001) mark and females at the one- (aOR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.33 - 2.14, p < 0.001) and two-year (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI, 1.51 - 2.14, p < 0.001) mark. Finally, vitamin D-deficient patients had a significantly increased likelihood of undergoing a revision ACL reconstruction within two years of a primary reconstruction (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI, 1.05 - 1.55, p = 0.012).

Conclusion: This study reports an association between patients previously diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D and significantly increased rates of both index ACL tears (81% increase within two years of diagnosis) and revision ACLR (28% within two years). These results identify a population with increased odds of injury and provide valuable knowledge as we expand our understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and musculoskeletal health.

##### Regarding “A Diagnosis of Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated With Increased Rates of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears and Reconstruction Failure” - Dec 2023

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2023.07.033

Tyler Barker, Ph.D.

It was with great interest I read the article entitled “A Diagnosis of Vitamin D Deficiency Is Associated With Increased Rates of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears and Reconstruction Failure” by Albright and colleagues.1 From a large, well-designed, retrospective study, Albright and colleagues1 identify an increase in index anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and revision ACL surgery rates with hypovitaminosis D. The inherent limitations of a retrospective protocol are discussed therein.1 It is noteworthy, however, to highlight a significant strength of the study that has been lacking in this overarching field of research. Specifically, **Albright and colleagues1 assessed vitamin D status before trauma and related vitamin D status to ACL injury and revision surgery rates.**  This is significant because Albright and colleagues1 controlled for the potentially deleterious and confounding influence of trauma-induced inflammation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations2,  3,  4 by assessing vitamin D status before an ACL injury.

The systemic inflammatory response to an ACL injury (and surgery) is characterized by transient perturbations in diverse cytokines.5,  6,  7 In addition to regulating host defenses and cell signaling, cytokines moderate the enzymatic machinery of vitamin D metabolism in peripheral blood immune cells.2,8,9 Thus it is plausible that cytokine alterations in the circulation after an ACL injury contribute to the conversation of 25(OH)D to other vitamin D metabolites (e.g., 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).6 This, in turn, temporally compromises serum 25(OH)D concentrations and potentially confounds both the interpretation of vitamin D status4,10,11 and its subsequently inferred association with desired outcomes or variables.

The unique findings by Albright and colleagues1 also establish the basis for future vitamin D research in those at risk for an ACL injury and outcomes after an ACL injury and surgery. For example, taking into consideration the recent association of index ACL tears with low vitamin D1 and concomitant knee structure damage with an ACL injury,12 it is reasonable to presume that low serum 25(OH)D exacerbates knee structure damage (e.g., meniscus, cartilage, or both) with an ACL injury. Second, low vitamin D and ACL injuries are related to the progression in knee osteoarthritis and post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA), respectively.13,14 However, it is unknown whether low vitamin D contributes to the development and progression in PTOA after an ACL injury. Third, low vitamin D associates with muscular weakness after an ACL injury15 and with muscular atrophy and weakness in other conditions.16,  17,  18 Quadriceps atrophy and weakness are predominant impairments that continue to challenge the rehabilitative efforts after an ACL injury and surgery, and it is unknown if correcting hypovitaminosis D diminishes muscular impairments and improves outcomes after an ACL injury.

Albright and colleagues1 are commended for performing an outstanding study that extends our current knowledge. Future research assessing the impact of trauma induced alterations on serum 25(OH)D and determining whether correcting hypovitaminosis D improves outcomes after an ACL injury are warranted.
