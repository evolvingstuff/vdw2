* It is well known that the response to Vitamin D and UVB varies by up to 4X between individuals

   * Until this paper there was little clue as to the reason for the different responses

* The same individuals were given 3400 IU and UVB  (at different times) which on average resulted in increase blood level of 21 ng

* It appears that those having a low response to Vitamin D also has a low response to UVB, etc.

* Just 4 gene modifications (SNIPS) are able to characterize 87% of the individual differences in the responses
