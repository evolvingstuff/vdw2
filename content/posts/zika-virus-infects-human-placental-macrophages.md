### [Science Daily report on this study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160527133335.htm%20)

* Hofbauer cells

* ‘"A concept that is emerging is how host genetics or other non-viral factors, including nutrition and microbiota,  **influence your immune response** ," Suthar says. "What our study  **suggests is not everyone is predisposed to having the virus replicate in the placenta** , but the full meaning of this needs to be explored further.”

They are getting closer to understanding Zika and placenta immune system

The PDF does not contain the word VITAMIN (not expected) , but does use the word IMMUNE 5 times

 **<span style="color:#F00;">VitaminDWiki has offered authors (and others) a reward for the placenta Vitamin D levels</span>**
