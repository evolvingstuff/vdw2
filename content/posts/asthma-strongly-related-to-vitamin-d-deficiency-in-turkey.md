Abstract (provisional)

Background: Epidemiological studies show that vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are common worldwide and associated with many diseases including asthma. Our aim was to evaluate vitamin D insufficiency and its clinical consequences.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 170 children consisted of 85 who were asthmatic and 85 who were not, aged 2 to 14?years in Tekirdag, Turkey, from September 2009 to May 2010. Children?s basal serum D vitamin levels were determined, and their eating habits, vitamin D intake, exposure to sunlight and use of health services during the previous year were investigated. The severity of asthma and levels of asthma control were assessed according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines.

Results: The difference between mean vitamin D levels in the asthmatic group (mean +/- SD) 16.6 +/- 8.5?ng/mL and the healthy control group (mean +/- SD) 28.2 +/- 19.5?ng/mL was found to be statistically significant (p?<?0.001). Children in the asthma group had less exposure to sunlight and ate a diet less rich in vitamin D (p?<?0.001). A significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the frequency of respiratory tract infections leading to emergency unit admissions and number of hospitalizations (p?<?0.001). It was also shown that a decrease in vitamin D level increased the severity of asthma (p?<?0.001) and decreased the frequency of controlled asthma (p?=?0.010).

Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the correlation between plasma 25 (OH) D levels and childhood asthma. Evidently, this relationship being influenced by multiple factors other than vitamin D, further studies should be conducted to explore the interrelation between all such factors.

### Severity of Asthma vs Vitamin D

#### Clipped from study

* Our study showed that asthmatic children had less exposure to sunlight compared to control group (p < 0.001). This is explained by the fact that families wanted to keep  their children at home for fear of an asthma attack if they went outdoors or engaged in physical activities.

* When  analysing  the  RTIs  of  the  previous  year,  we  observed  that  as  vitamin  D  levels decreased, RTI frequency increased in both the asthmatic and the control groups, and there were frequent incidences of RTI in asthmatic patients with low vitamin D levels <sup>[15]</sup>, leading to an increase in the severity of the asthma attack <sup>[6]</sup>.

*  **Conclusion**  In summary, in our study, we tried to clarify the role of vitamin D in asthma. We found that vitamin D levels were considerably lower in children with asthma  than in healthy children. Exposure  to  sunlight  and  a  diet  rich  in  vitamin  D  increased  the  vitamin  D  levels  in  both asthmatic  and  healthy  children.  The  children  with  asthma  and  healthy children  with  low vitamin D levels had frequent RTIs, leading to more EU admissions and to more use of health services owing to more hospitalizations. A higher frequency of asthma attacks, more severe asthmatic  episodes  and  greater  difficulty  in  asthma  control  were observed  in  asthmatic children with low vitamin D levels. We found a relationship between serum vitamin D levels and asthma; however, this relationship could be influenced by multiple factors. Thus, there remains  a  need  to  investigate  further  the  relationship  between  asthma  and  vitamin  D  in  a multidisciplinary fashion.
