## October is Breast Cancer Month

A paper was presented Oct 3, 2010 which was reported in the LA Times with the title: [Pregnant breast cancer patients more likely to survive](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/30/news/la-heb-pregnancy-cancer-20100930)

"Five years after their diagnosis, almost 74% of the women diagnosed with breast cancer during pregnancy were still alive. Among their sisters who were not pregnant when they got treatment, 55.75% survived to the five-year mark. "

## Here is the line of reasoning at VitaminDWiki

* Vitamin D has been proven to <a href="/posts/reduce-problems-with-pregnancy" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 816">reduce problems with pregnancy</a>

* We speculate that some women in the study were taking 4,000 of more IU of vitamin D to reduce pregnancy problems and improve the health of their infant.

* For some women, 4,000 IU will bring the vitamin D level in the blood up into the 60 ng/ml range

* Vitamin D improves the [outcome of many cancers ](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=74&sort_mode=created_desc) for a wide variety of reasons.*Vitamin D has been proven to reduced breast cancer by 60% when the blood level if 60ng/ml

^~~#F09:In summary, the hypothesis is:

Some women took enough vitamin D during pregnancy so as to reduce breast cancer~~^
