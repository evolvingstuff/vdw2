Although 25(OH) D levels were significantly lower in the cholecystectomy group (12.1 ± 6.2 vs. 15.6 ± 6.6 ng/mL), no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of BMD measurements.</p><p>INTRODUCTION:</p><p>Although 25 (OH) D levels were studied and found to be lower in patients with cholecystectomy, the data is scarce as regards the BMD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the 25(OH) D and BMD values of patients with cholecystectomy and without cholecystectomy.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>This study was a single-center and case-control trial. The cholecystectomy group comprised the patients with a history of cholecystectomy. In addition, a healthy control group without a history of cholecystectomy was defined. All patients were selected consecutively from the patients who were admitted to the outpatient clinics of physical and rehabilitation medicine or internal medicine between June 2016 and August 2016. The patients were ambulatory and did not receive any osteoporosis treatment before. The chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay method was used for 25(OH) D measurements. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used for the BMD evaluations.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>There were 46 patients in the cholecystectomy group with a mean age of 58.6 ± 14.1 years and 64 patients in the control group with a mean age of 59.2 ± 13.3 years. Although 25(OH) D levels were significantly lower in the cholecystectomy group (12.1 ± 6.2 vs. 15.6 ± 6.6 ng/mL) (p = 0.010), no significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of BMD measurements (p > 0.05). While there was a weak positive correlation between the BMI and BMD measurements (all p &lt; 0.05), linear regression analyses showed that the models were not valid (femoral neck R = 0.092; femur total R = 0.170; and lumbar total R = 0.199). No significant difference was observed between the BMD measurements and time after cholecystectomy in the cholecystectomy group (p > 0.05).</p><p>CONCLUSION: In light of our results, cholecystectomy patients seem to have lower levels of 25(OH) D levels in comparison with healthy subjects, but both groups have similar BMD values. Further studies in cohort designs taking into account the bone formation and resorption markers are awaited.</p><hr><h4 id=demographics-overweight-middle-agedfemales>Demographics: Overweight, middle-aged females</h4><p><a href=http://www.surgery.com/procedure/gallstone-removal/demographics>http://www.surgery.com/procedure/gallstone-removal/demographics</a></p><p>Gallstones are approximately two times more common in females than in males. Overweight women in their middle years constitute the vast majority of patients with gallstones in every racial or ethnic group. An estimated 10% of the general population&mldr; has gallstones. The prevalence for women between ages 20 and 55 varies from 5–20% and is higher after age 50 (25–30%). The prevalence for males is approximately half that for women in a given age group. Certain people, in particular the Pima tribe of Native Americans in Arizona, have a genetic predisposition to forming gallstones. Scandinavians also have a higher-than-average incidence of this disease.</p><h4 id=strong-geneticcorrelation>Strong genetic correlation</h4><p>There seems to be a strong genetic correlation with gallstone disease since stones are more than <strong>four times as likely to occur among first-degree relatives</strong> . Since gallstones rarely dissolve spontaneously, the prevalence increases with age. Obesity is a well-known risk factor since overweight causes chemical abnormalities that lead to increased levels of cholesterol. Gallstones are also associated with rapid weight loss secondary to dieting. <strong>Pregnancy is a risk factor</strong> since increased estrogen levels result in increased cholesterol secretion and abnormal changes in bile. However, while an increase in dietary cholesterol is not a risk factor, an increase in triglycerides is positively associated with a higher incidence of gallstones. Diabetes mellitus is also believed to be a risk factor for gallstone development.</p><p><strong>(Note: weight, pregnancy, diabetes, and high blood pressure are associated with gallstones and are associated with low levels of vitamin D)</strong></p><hr><p><a href=http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/gallbladder/a/gallstonessymtr_5.htm>http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/gallbladder/a/gallstonessymtr_5.htm</a></p><p>Gallstones affect approximately one in ten Americans and are associated with approximately 3,000 deaths annually.</p><p>More than 800,000 hospitalizations each year are caused by gallstones that are large enough to cause significant pain.</p><p>Over 500,000 people undergo surgery for gallstones annually.</p><p>Obesity is one of the strongest risk factors for gallstones.</p><p>Rapid weight loss diets significantly increase the risk of gallstones.</p><hr><p>Gallbladder concentrates the bile from the Live so that it can be used to digest fats in the colon.

In vivo study in the rat.</strong></p><p>Isr J Med Sci. 1987 Nov;23(11):1114-7.</p><p>Maislos M1, Shany S.</p><p>We studied the effect of the absence of bile salts on the absorption of vitamin D metabolites in vivo in the biliary duct-ligated rat. The mesenteric, lymphatic absorption of the metabolites studied (vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) <strong>was almost completely abolished in the experimental animals</strong> . These results differed significantly (P less than 0.001) from those of the control rats. The 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 absorption into the portal vein system was unaffected by the lack of biliary salts. The absorption of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was decreased, and t <strong>hat of vitamin D3 was negligible</strong>  under the same experimental conditions. These data show that the more polar vitamin D metabolites, like 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and, to some extent 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, are absorbed directly into the portal blood without the involvement of bile salts and micelle formation. Thus, the use of polar vitamin D metabolites should be considered in correcting hypovitaminosis D and osteomalacia in cases of chronic biliary salt depletion.</p><hr><h4 id=a-hrefpostsoverview-deficiency-of-vitamin-d-stylecolor-red-text-decoration-underline-titlethis-link-has-an-unknown-page_id-889overview-deficiency-of-vitamin-da-has-a-chart---the-following-is-a-portion-of-that-chart---showing-viciouscycles><a href=/posts/overview-deficiency-of-vitamin-d style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 889">Overview Deficiency of vitamin D</a> has a chart - the following is a portion of that chart - showing vicious cycles</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/gallbladder.jpg alt=image><hr><p><strong>Seem strange that I have never noticed Vitamin D studies asking if participants still had gallbladders.</strong></p><p><strong>Gallbladder removal reduces vitamin D levels and will probably result in poor bio-availability of most (fat-soluble) vitamin D supplements</strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-alsoweb>See also web</h4><ul><li><a href=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2012/08/24/overweight-kids-more-prone-to-gallstones-study>Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition</a> as reported in US News.] Aug 2012</li></ul><blockquote><p>Moderately Obese kids are 4X more likely to have gallstones and Extremely obese kids 6X</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>No mention in the US News article of vitamin D</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href=http://www.gallbladderattack.com/gallbladdersurgery.shtml>gallbladderattack.com</a> has a nice description of reasons to avoid surgery AND what to do if you have had surgery</p></li><li><p><a href=http://drgominak.com/vitamin-d-3/>Vit­a­min D and Neu­ro­logic Disorders</a> Dr. Gominak</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Pregnancy ==> low vitamin D ==> gallbladder problems ==> gallbladder removal often during pregnancy</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/gallstones/surgery.html>Gallstone Surgery NYT</a> has a good summary of types, when to get surgery, etc., from A.D.A.M.</p></li><li><p><a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173578615000384>Implications of vitamin D deficiency in lithiasic patient and in general population</a> May 2015</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Found a strong association between stone formation and low vitamin D</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Recommends that stone formers be tested for low vitamin D - publisher wants $31 for the PDF</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/throwaway-organ-you-cant-live-without>The Throwaway Organ You Can&rsquo;t Live Without</a> GreenMedInfo Nov 2016</li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Consider this: without bile, you lose the lubricating benefits of those fat-soluble nutrients.
