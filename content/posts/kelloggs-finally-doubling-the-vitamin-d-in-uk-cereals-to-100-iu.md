#### Note by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki

I have experimented with fortification of my cereal with 10,000 IU of Vitamin D daily

I seem to get more benefit from the same amount at suppertime.

Vitamin D at supper stays in the small intestine for 12 hours, rather than 4 hours for breakfast meal.

Vitamin D is primarily absorbed in the small intestine

 **Bottome line:**  Consume your vitamin D at supper, not breakfast
