The fact that the active form of vitamin D required of an internal synthesis and has an important role in regulating calcium and phosphorus metabolism has many authors consider more a hormone than a vitamin.</p><p>The story of vitamin D may be linked to the raquitismo1. The disease, caused by vitamin D deficiency, was described clinically in the seventeenth century. In 1931, Askaw defined chemical composition of vitamin D2 and subsequent years investigated the mechanisms of production of active forms of vitamin D in the body and their actions on mineral metabolism. Although a general observation that niñnos diagnosed rickets were more prone to disease and vitamin D infecciosas2 was related to the modulation of the immune system, not until this century when performed numerous observational studies on its role in different diseases, ones that involve the immune system and others in which this relationship is not established, such as hypertension, diabetes or syndrome metabólico3, 4. The interest of the scientific community for this vitamin is demonstrated by the fact that in 2 years, more than 5,500 registered PubMed articles on the subject.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to review recent studies on physiology, action, determination, desirable levels in the body and intake recommendations for vitamin D, as well as raise issues related to new lines of research.</p><h2 id=physiology-of-vitamin-d>Physiology of vitamin D</h2><p>Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that can be found in the body as endogenous and exogenous 5-7. The endogenous production form, cholecalciferol (D3) is the main source of vitamin D. Is synthesized in mammalian skin by the action of ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), which produces the photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol, making vitamin D3 6.8. &ldquo;10 may also be an external input through cholecalciferol some foods.</p><p>The ergocalciferol (D2) is obtained through diet and is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum, absorption is favored by the presence of fat is between 55 and 99% of oral intake 5 &ldquo;7.11.</p><p>The 2 types of vitamin D must undergo a complex process prior to being metabolically active 5,6,9. 2 suffers prohormone hydroxylations, one in the liver, resulting in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) or calcidiol 7,11,12, and other primarily in the renal tubule, by 1-o-hydroxylase , leading to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25 (OH) D) or calcitriol, which is at least 10 times more potent than 25 (OH) D, although it has a circulating concentration inferior7 1,000 times, 12. The 1-hydroxylase or also in other tissues that also express vitamin D receptors, such as placenta, colon, keratinocytes, activated mononuclear cells and osteoblasts, which could produce 1.25 (OH) D with a local function or autocrine paracrine 7,8,11,12.</p><p>Values ??of 1.25 (OH) D are regulated by the 1-or hydro-xilasa. The hydroxylation is activated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin, and is inhibited by plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus and self 1.25 (OH) D. The phosphatonins (FGF23), growth hormone, IGF-I or prolactin also act directly or indirectly on the 1-hydroxylase or kidney, although the exact relationship and its clinical significance are still unclear from 6.12 to 14 .</p><p>Under normal circumstances, approximately 85% of 1.25 (OH) D is attached to the binding protein or vitamin D transcalciferina (DBP) 6 and 15% albumin, being free circulation in plasma less than 0.5 % to 1.25 (OH) D and less than 0.05% for 25 (OH) D. These forms are the only circulating free available for binding to receptors on target cells 11,12.</p><p>Half life varies with the metabolite, 25 (OH) D is about 15 days 7,11,12.</p><p>At high doses, vitamin D can be stored in adipose tissue and may have an average life of 7.11 months.</p><p>Although both vitamins (D2 and D3) have identical biological functions, some studies suggest that vitamin <strong>D3 may be 2 or 3 times more powerful</strong> to keep the levels of 25 (OH) D 6,7,12, in addition, 25 (OH) D3 could join DBP with higher affinity than 25 (OH) D2 12.</p><p>The main action of vitamin D is to maintain the numbers of calcium and phosphorus within the physiological range allowing metabolism, neuromuscular transmission bone mineralization and 6.7, but described the presence of vitamin D receptors in bone marrow bone, cartilage, hair follicles, adipose tissue, adrenal, brain, stomach, small intestine, distal renal tubule, colon, pancreas (cells (3), liver, lung, muscle, activated B and T lymphocytes, heart, juxtaglomerular cells, vascular smooth muscle, gonads, prostate, breast, parathyroid cells, parotid gland, placenta, retina, thymus and thyroid 7,10,12. For this reason, you assume various functions 10,12,15. has been observed that vitamin D inhibits growth and stimulates keratinocyte differentiation, and vitamin D concentrations above 75 mmol / l (30 ng / ml) keep cell growth under control and prevent the cells are autonomous and malignicen 15.</p><h2 id=determination-of-vitamin-d-and-normal-values>Determination of vitamin D and normal values</h2><p>The units used in the determination of the 25 (OH) D in the blood are ng / ml and nmol / l, 1 ng / ml 25 (OH) D is 2.496 nmol / l. The amount is given in vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) by food or drug is usually expressed in &ldquo;international units&rdquo; (IU), equivalent to 1 40 IU of vitamin D2 or D3.</p><p>The results of the values ??of 25 (OH) D in blood vary according to the method used to obtain and may even have inter-method differences 16.17 dependent calibration, which can lead to the same sample at higher or lower results laboratory to laboratory. The value of 25 (OH) D can be determined by competitive immunoassay techniques, chemiluminescence or by chromatography nonimmunologic direct detection (HPLC-UVy LC-MS/MS) 18. Chromatographic methods can be measured independently 25 (OH) D2 and 25 (OH) D3, but in most immunoassays ratio of 25 (OH) D2 detected is variable. The UK Food Standards Agency diferentes19 compared 5 methods. The chromatographic results were similar but not those made by immunoassay. Opted for recommending the LC-MS/MS. This method is used by the U.S. CDC. States. since 2007. In Espanña are most commonly used immunoassay-based methods, being more economical.</p><p>From a clinical point of view, all methods are valid to detect serious deficiencies of vitamin D 16. For moderate assume a certain risk of error that can be partially alleviated by considering the reference values ??for each laboratory. This does not apply to research studies in which standardized methods must be 16-20.</p><p>Periodically, we performed a <strong>workshop on vitamin D</strong> , which brings together over 400 experts from 35 countries to reach a consensus on the ideal values ??of vitamin D in blood. Most experts meeting in 2009 agreed on the need for a minimum value of 20 ng / ml (50 nmol / l) for good bone health and mineral, although according to this criterion a large proportion of world population is deficient in vitamin D. But there are authors that are based on studies involving bone diseases not considered as normal and anything between 30 and 40 ng / ml 21 -23.</p><h2 id=sources-of-vitamin-d>Sources of vitamin D</h2><p>Humans can get vitamin D from sun exposure (vitamin D3) and intake (vitamin D2, mainly).</p><p>In the newborn, the vitamin D depends on maternal status of vitamin D, which passes through the placenta, and after birth depends on domestic production and exogenous 7,13,14. The preterm infant has less time to accumulate vitamin D and, therefore, have higher requirements for vitamin D than the term infant 15.</p><h2 id=solar-power>Solar Power</h2><p>It is considered that 80-90% of vitamin D in humans comes from cutaneous synthesis from the action of UVB radiation 8.10. Several factors influence the production of vitamin D in skin. The melanin pigment of skin absorbs UVB photons and acts as a natural sunscreen, but it makes dark-skinned people require up to 5 or 10 times more sun exposure than fair-skinned to synthesize similar amounts of vitamin D 7,8,10,12,15,24,25</p><p>The incidence of UVB decreases with increasing latitude, because the oblique angle through which the sunlight reaching the atmosphere causes the path through it is greater and will produce a greater scattering and absorption of UV 7,12,15,25.</p><p>It is a very small amount of vitamin D during the winter months, due to increased warm clothing, reducing the time spent away from home and the decrease in UV radiation reaching the earth&rsquo;s surface by the greater obliquity of the sun , which means that over the 35-40 ° latitude (the Iberian Peninsula is between 36 ° and 43.5 °) in the winter months, the number of UVB photons that reach the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere decreases 80-100%, not achieving the minimum threshold required to induce the synthesis of vitamin D and, therefore, their production is negligible during these months 7,8,12,15,24,25</p><p>The rays penetrate obliquely into the early hours of the day and late Therefore, at these times only produced pequenñas amounts of vitamin D in the skin, even in the summer months the only time they reach the surface Earth insufficient UVB photons to produce vitamin D is between 10 and 15 hours (solar time) in spring, summer and has been shown otonño a brief statement at noon has a maximum benefit of vitamin D with reduced risk of eritema15, 24 &ldquo;26.</p><p>And the pollution clouds can decrease the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth&rsquo;s surface 7.15.</p><p>A factor 2 sunscreen blocks approximately 50% of UVB, SPF 15 to 94% and 97% factor of 30, if applied correctly. These guards seem to block more effective radiation for the synthesis of vitamin D for erythema 7,8,12,15,24,26.</p><p>It has been observed that increasing the concentration of vitamin D, at least 20% of body surface must be exposed to UVB 7,8,12,15,24,26. Clothing can decrease the amount of vitamin D synthesized by UVB and the fabric is important, with the black wool 2 times more effective absorbing and preventing the incidence of UVB on the skin than white cotton.</p><p>The greater the thickness of the ozone layer 24, less UVB rays reaching the earth&rsquo;s surface, so that high altitudes are associated with increased amount of UV radiation 15. It is considered that for every mile you go up, increasing by 6% incidence of UV radiation 15. Furthermore, the snow can reflect a 20% to 30% of radiation reaching the soil as the water or sand.</p><p>The ninños may require less sun exposure to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D by the large surface area relative to the size and the ability to produce more vitamin D than adults 7.15.</p><p>Phototherapy applied to infants does not influence the vitamin D 27 values ??for the current phototherapy lamps do not use UVB.</p><p>Excessive sun exposure is a rare cause of vitamin D intoxication because the previtamin D can be degraded by UVB radiation as lumisterol inert products and tachysterol and vitamin D to suprasterol fotoisomeriza and other inert 12.15, 28.</p><h2 id=dietary-sources-of-vitamin-d>Dietary sources of vitamin D</h2><p>Vitamin D can also be obtained from foods that naturally contain or have been supplemented. Table 1 shows the approximate content of vitamin D of different foods. These values ??can vary according to the &ldquo;state&rdquo; of the food. For example, in the eel can vary from 200 IU to 800 IU, and the way they fry, <strong>glass eels, can have up to 4,400 IU per 100g</strong> , the mushrooms are rich in vitamin D only if they have been subjected to full sunlight for 5 or 10 min or were treated with UV rays. The form also influences cooking: frying fish reduces its vitamin D around 50%, while the cook is not affected 9,15,29.</p><p>Breast milk is low in vitamin D, which varies between 4 and 100 IU / l depending on maternal stores, food and sun exposure of the mother 7,9,14,15. In the case of an average consumption of 750ml/día, breast-feeding exclusively without exposure to sunlight provides UI/día15 of 11 to 38 but not known how these values ??relate to the optimal calcium absorption and may bioavailability calcium from milk is different and less dependent transport of vitamin D9, 14.</p><p>Supplementation of different foods with vitamin D is based on population to ensure a contribution</p><p>R.M. Masvidal Aliberch et al</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Vitamin D: pathophysiology and clinical applicability</p><p>Most provide a minimum of 400 IU of vitamin D per liter of milk reconstituida9, 14, as recommended by the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) and ESPGHAN.</p><p>Another source of vitamin D dosage forms, available as vitamin D2 or D3.</p><p>In situations of intestinal malabsorption, as in celiac disease, gastric or intestinal resection, pancreatic insufficiency (such as cystic fibrosis), Crohn&rsquo;s disease and cholestatic liver disease, can greatly decrease the absorption of vitamin D15.</p><h2 id=values-of-vitamin-d-in-apparently-healthy-populations>Values ??of vitamin D in apparently healthy populations</h2><p>In countries like Iran, vitamin D deficiency is very prevalente30, especially among women and adolescents preteens 31, most likely due to clothing. In EE. States. found values ??&lt;50 nmol / l in more than a quarter of the ninños pequenños of low income families 32 and in 12.1% of ninños and adolescentes33. In Canada, a survey that included a population of 6 to 79 annos, 10% had figures &lt;37.5 nmol/l34, and another study noted that niñnas of low income families had low levels of vitamin D 35 . We found very low levels of vitamin D in ninñas Pakistani adolescents (mean of 10.9 nmol / l) immigrated to Denmark 36. In a study Espanña in Madrid that included 102 children aged 9 to 13 years and found a value &lt;50 nmol / l in 51% of cases 37, and in one study in infants Valencian mean values 25 (OH) D in winter, in the breastfeeding group was 16.8 ng / ml (42 nmol / l) 38.</p><p>The low levels of vitamin D in apparently healthy ninños have been linked to sun exposure, race, low intake of foods with vitamin D, obesity, age and social stratum 39-42.</p><p>It is also important to know the status for vitamin D in pregnant women, as this may affect the newborn 43.44, especially the premature. In a U.S. study. States., Arab mothers and their premature children had higher vitamin D deficiencies in relation to Caucasian mothers and their children 45. Also have found high rates of deficiency in mothers of Pakistan, Turkey and Somalia immigrants to Noruega46. This is especially relevant given the current high prevalence of immigration in our country.</p><h2 id=bone-diseases-related-to-vitamin-d-deficiency>Bone diseases related to vitamin D deficiency</h2><p>Classically related diseases with vitamin D deficiency have been bone (rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis) 4.43.</p><p>These conditions can also be produced by significant deficiencies of calcium and certain metabolic disorders.</p><p>Rickets seemed to be a disease eradicated in the vast majority of first world countries due to improved feeding, supplementation with vitamin D and increased outdoor activities in industrial areas, but immigration has led to its resurgence 48-53. Originates with vitamin D values ??of &lt;25 nmol / l (10 ng / ml).</p><p>Osteomalacia or adult rickets, presents with an inadequate mineralization of cortical and cancellous bone maturity. Osteomalacia found in patients with values ??&lt;62 nmol / l (25 ng / ml) 4.</p><p>Osteoporosis presents with loss of trabecular bone strength and reduced bone cortex and become susceptible to fractures. Supplements of vitamin D and calcium may be useful for prevention if achieved figures of vitamin D of 62 nmol / l, although this is questionable.</p><p>Bone mineralization occurs predominantly in the first 2 decades of life and has studied whether administration of vitamin D may increase bone density. Not found in ninños with adequate levels of vitamin D (50 nmol / l) and must do more studies in children with deficiency 54.</p><h2 id=not-related-bone-diseases-of-vitamin-d-deficiency>Not related bone diseases of vitamin D deficiency</h2><p>Many diseases have been linked to low values ??(&lt;50 nmol / l) or moderate (between 50 and 75 nmol / l between 50 and 100 nmol / l) of 25 (OH) D 4.47. In no bony pathology has been demonstrated that association does not prove a causal effect and in many cases there are confounding etiological factors that cause results have to be observed with caution. There have been case studies of intervention / control, but virtually all conclude that we need more research 22.</p><p>The vitamin D can increase the secretion and insulin sensitivity. A meta-analysis of 5 observational studies of vitamin D supplementation in infancy was a reduction of almost 30% risk of type 1 diabetes in ninños that had ever received vitamin D 55, but these studies suffered from methodological problems.</p><p>We performed a meta-analysis 56 in relation to vitamin D and cardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes. Three of 6 analyzes (of 4 different cohorts) found a lower incidence of diabetes in people with a higher value of vitamin D. Moreover, 8 trials found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood sugar or diabetes recently established.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with obesity 57-61, but it is unknown whether as cause or effect.

Other organizations such as the UK National Radiological Protection Board, saying that short periods abroad, such as during daily life, would be sufficient to produce adequate vitamin D 28.

Vitamin D supplements may be marketed prepared from vitamin D2 or D3.
