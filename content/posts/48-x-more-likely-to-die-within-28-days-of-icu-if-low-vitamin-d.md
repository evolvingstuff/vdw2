Background & objective

Patients in the intensive care unit have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD). In the present study, clinical outcomes in the ICU were analyzed with vitamin D status.

Materials and methods

In this prospective, multicenter study, sampling was conducted on seven ICUs in three hospitals. Within the first 24 h of ICU admission, patient’s serum vitamin D levels were measured, and their disease severity was monitored using the scores of acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and the modified Nutrition Risk in Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score.

Results

A total of 236 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 163 (69.1%) had lower vitamin D levels than 20 ng/ml upon ICU admission. The patients with VDD had higher APACHE II scores)P = 0.02), SOFA scores (P < 0.001), and mNUTRIC scores (P = 0.01). Patients with sufficient levels of vitamin D (> 30 ng/ml) had a shorter stay at ICU (P < 0.001). VDD was independently associated with 28-day mortality (OR: 4.83; 95% CI: 1.63–14.27; P = 0.004).

Conclusion

The data showed that VDD was common among the critically ill and was related to a more severe course of illness and a higher mortality rate.
