### Note that truck drivers:

* Are older

* Have various health problems, 

   * including diabetes which is associated with increased risk of COVID-19

* Have 16 year shorter lives

* Encounter many people

* Have lower level of vitamin D due to increased UVA to UVB ratio of light coming thru truck window

#### A novel COVID-19 based truck driver syndemic? Implications for public health, safety, and vital supply chains

U.S. long-haul truck drivers traverse great distances and interact with numerous individuals, rendering them vulnerable to acquiring and transmitting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Together, the unique co-occurrence of pronounced health disparities and known COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality risks suggest the possibility of a novel COVID-19 based truck driver syndemic due to advanced driver age and endemic health issues. In turn, COVID-19 sequelae may perpetuate existing health disparities. The co-occurrence of afflictions may also result in compromised safety performance. To curb the likelihood of a COVID-19 based truck driver syndemic, several action stepsare needed. 

* First, key COVID-19 metrics need to be established for this population. 

* Second, relationships between long-haul trucker network attributes and COVID-19 spread need to bedelineated.

* Third, mutually reinforcing interactions between endemic health disparities and COVID-19 vulnerability need to be elucidated. 

* Finally, grounded in the aforementioned steps, policies and interventions need to be identified and implemented.
