Vitamin D is a particularly important sterol hormone and its effects beyond bone are increasingly recognised. Over the last decade clinical interest has grown in vitamin D, with increased recognition of deficiency and hence increased prescribing of vitamin D products. However, the increased prescription of vitamin D has generally been met with unlicensed vitamin D products which potentially expose the patient to clinical risk. This review discusses the issues relating to the clinical use of unlicensed vitamin D products, safety concerns that may arise from this, as well as discussing the medico-legal responsibilities of the prescriber and dispenser.
