# Lower on D

HHS HealthBeat (July 29, 2009) http://www.hhs.gov/news/healthbeat/2009/07/20090729a.html

From the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, I’m Ira Dreyfuss with HHS HealthBeat.

Vitamin D is good for a lot of things, and one study indicates girls who get enough D are more likely to grow taller as opposed to wider.

Researcher  **Richard Kremer**  of McGill University in Canada, with Dr. Vicente Gilsanz at the University of Southern California, found that in data on California girls. Kremer says girls with normal levels of vitamin D had more height. He says girls with insufficient vitamin D were heavier, especially with belly fat.

<span>[Richard Kremer speaks]</span> ``The difference was about 7 kilos, which I believe would be about 17 or 18 pounds.’’

Kremer says his study can’t prove the variation in vitamin D made the difference.  **But he notes lack of D can cause fat to accumulate** .

The study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism was supported by the National Institutes of Health.
