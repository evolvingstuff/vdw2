Background

Low and high concentrations of plasma magnesium are associated with increased risk of future all-cause dementia; however, the underlying reasons remain elusive. The magnesium ion is an important electrolyte serving as a cofactor in many enzymatic processes in the human organism. Magnesium affects both neuronal and vascular functions. We investigated the associations of plasma concentrations of magnesium associate with common subtypes of dementia as Alzheimer dementia and non-Alzheimer dementia, and potential pathways by which magnesium may affect risk of dementia.

Methods

Plasma concentrations of magnesium were measured in 102 648 individuals from the Copenhagen General Population Study. Cox regression and natural effects mediation analyses evaluated associations with either Alzheimer dementia or non-Alzheimer dementia.

Results

Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for non-Alzheimer dementia were  **1.50** (95% confidence interval (CI):1.21–1.87) for the lowest and 1.34(1.07–1.69) for the highest vs the fourth quintile (reference) of plasma magnesium concentrations. Diabetes, cumulated smoking, stroke, and systolic blood pressure mediated 10.4%(3.1–22.8%), 6.8%(1.2–14.0%), 1.3%(0.1–3.6%), and 1.0%(0.2–2.6%), respectively, in the lowest quintile, whereas stroke mediated 3.2%(0.4–11.9%) in the highest quintile. No associations were observed for Alzheimer dementia.

Conclusions

Low and high plasma magnesium concentrations were associated with high risk of vascular-related non-Alzheimer dementia, with the lowest risk observed at a concentration of 2.07 mg/dL (0.85 mmol/L). No association was observed for Alzheimer dementia. Mediation analysis suggested that diabetes may be in the causal pathway between low plasma magnesium concentrations and high risk of non-Alzheimer dementia, while cumulated smoking, stroke, and systolic blood pressure played minor mediating roles.

#### Dementia risk cut in half in those taking Magnesium (as a laxative) – Jan 2018

 **Magnesium oxide use and reduced risk of dementia: a retrospective, nationwide cohort study in Taiwan.** 

Curr Med Res Opin. 2018 Jan;34(1):163-169. [doi: 10.1080/03007995.2017.1385449.](https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2017.1385449.) Epub 2017 Oct 30.

OBJECTIVE:

Dietary magnesium may be associated with a lower risk of dementia; however, the impact of magnesium oxide (MgO), a common laxative, on dementia has yet to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the association between the usage of MgO and the risk of developing dementia.

METHODS:

We used a dataset from the National Health Research Institute Database (NHRID) of Taiwan containing one million randomly sampled subjects to identify patients aged ≥50 years with no history of MgO usage. A total of 1547 patients who had used MgO were enrolled, along with 4641 controls who had not used the MgO propensity score matched by age, gender and comorbidity, at a ratio of 1:3. After adjusting for confounding risk factors, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the risk of developing dementia during a 10 year follow-up period.

RESULTS:

Of the enrolled patients, 44 (2.84%) developed dementia, when compared to 199 (4.28%) in the control group. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that the patients who had used MgO were less likely to develop dementia with a crude hazard ratio of 0.617 (95% CI, 0.445-0.856, p = .004). After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidity, geographical area and urbanization level of residence, and monthly income, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.517 (95% CI, 0.412-0.793, p = .001).

CONCLUSIONS:

The patients who used MgO had a decreased risk of developing dementia. Further studies on the effects of MgO in reducing the risk of dementia are therefore warranted.
