#### Overview of Poor Response

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

 **~ 50% of all people have a low response to vitamin D3** 

 **~ 10% of all people have a ZERO response to a LOW dose** 

<!-- ~tc~ end ~/tc~ -->

<!-- ~tc~ startr ~/tc~ -->

There are 40+ reasons for poor blood response

Here are some of the common reasons 

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Obese &nbsp; Elderly &nbsp; Poor gut | 2X more needed <br>or ((Gut-Friendly Vitamin D | gut-friendly)) |
| Health problem reduces levels &nbsp; &nbsp; examples<br> ((Autistics have half of the response to Vitamin D – RCT Oct 2018 | Autism)),((Iron deficiency is a cause of Vitamin D deficiency | Anemia)), ((Diabetes changes liver genes so as to destroy (catabolize) Vitamin D – May 2016 | Diabetes)) Some Cancers | 2X more needed |
| ((Increased vitamin D in blood by 56% by taking supplement with largest meal of the day - May 2010 | Fail to take with the largest meal)) | 1.3X  more  needed  |
| ((Magnesium and Vitamin D – recent deficiencies, needed, synergistic - good overview 2017 | Low Magnesium)), ((Smoking reduces vitamin D - many studies | smoking)) | 1.3X  more  needed  |

 **Note:** 

* Any study will rarely consider even 4 of the above factors

* Factors are sometimes additive: example, 50% + 50% = 100%  = 2X as much Vitamin D is needed
