## BONE SPURS

Bone spurs are abnormal calcifications that occur in places beyond the boundaries of normal bone. Bone spurs commonly form on the heel and around joints such as your knee, shoulder, spine and fingers. Bone spurs cause problems because they interfere with the motion of joints and often physically irritate surrounding connective tissue such as ligaments and tendons. Reduced range of motion, inflammation and pain are common symptoms of bone spurs. Conventional treatment for bone spurs involves surgical removal, but natural remedies attempt to reverse the biochemical or hormonal conditions that caused the spur in hopes your body will naturally dissolve it.

## CAUSES

Bone is made of minerals, primarily calcium, magnesium and boron. For abnormal, noncancerous bone growth to occur, high levels of minerals need to be circulating within your bloodstream, which then collect near tendon and ligament attachments to bone. Over time, the minerals calcify and attach to the bone, forming thin projections that can be sharp. According to the book “Human Biochemistry” by Charles Dreiling, a common underlying condition that leads to bone spurs is  **systemic over-acidity** , which forces your body to mobilize alkaline minerals from your bones and deposit them in tissues that are too acidic. Hormonal imbalance also leads to loss of minerals from bone, which is where vitamin D comes into play.

## VITAMIN D

Vitamin D is essential for the maintenance of blood calcium levels within a narrow range, as well as for bone growth and maintenance of bone density. Vitamin D acts much like a hormone and is involved in calcium absorption from your intestines and its efficient use throughout your body. Vitamin D deficiency leads to too little calcium in your body, which eventually manifests as bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Suggested daily amounts of vitamin D consumption range from 600 to 800 international units, depending on your age, although your skin can produce many times that per hour when exposed to midday, summer sunshine.

Be very careful to not have too much Calcium with > 2,000 IU of vitamin D
