##### 5X difference in peak UVB

Dermal synthesis, following sun exposure, is the main source of vitamin D. This study characterizes ambient UVB radiation relevant for vitamin D production in Europe. A biological weighing function was applied to data from the Tropospheric Emissions Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) for 46 capital cities over an 18-year period (2004–2021) to isolate wavelengths relevant for vitamin D production (D-UVB). Cumulative and weighted D-UVB (CW-D-UVB) were calculated to approximate seasonal vitamin D accumulation and diminution. Monthly 25(OH)D concentration measurements were extracted from published reports. All data were analyzed by location and time. 

Despite a moderate latitudinal range (35–64° N), we observed large—up to  **five-fold** —regional differences: the highest mean diurnal D-UVB dose of 5.57 kJ/m2 (SD = 3.55 kJ/m2) was observed in Nicosia (Cyprus) and the lowest in Reykjavik (Iceland, 1.16 ± 1.29 kJ/m2). 

Seasonal differences in diurnal D-UVB dose were even more pronounced, with a median  **36-fold**  difference between annual peak and trough depending on a location (range: 10- to 525-fold). 

The mean duration of “vitamin D winter” was 126 days but varied widely  **(4 to 215 days).**  

Monthly CW-D-UVB and 25(OH)D changes were very strongly correlated: the changes in 25(OH)D concentration increased by 12.6 nmol/L for every 100 kJ/m2 increment of CW-D-UVB in population-based studies (r2 = 0.79, p-value = 1.16 × 10−37). Understanding the differences in D-UVB radiation can help understand determinants of vitamin D status and guide region- and season-specific safe and effective sunlight exposure recommendations and vitamin D supplementation guidelines.

#### 4 possible reasons for HIGHER Vitamin D in Northern latitudes

1. Vitamin D fortification of food - especially [Finland](/posts/after-years-of-adding-vitamin-d-finland-now-has-38-ng-levels)

1. More fish consumption  (provided not farmed fish)

   * Iceland: fish 91 kg /person annually/ Mainly cod and haddock - which are not farmed

1. Paler skin

   * "" It was found that individuals with the genetic LP variant had considerably higher levels of serum 25(OH)D (P < 2 × 10−16"

 **2 possible reasons for LOWER vitamin D in Northern Latitudes** 

1. Fewer hours of summer UVB 

> might get UVB from 9 AM to 3 PM near the eqator, vs. 10 AM to 2 PM in mid-latitudes or 11 AM to 1 PM in high latitudes

1. Less intense UVB

#### UVB lamp appears to give 2,000 IU/ min. if young, 200 IU/min if senior (founder of VitaminDWiki)

 **[Make your own UVB Vitamin D lamp for 40 dollars - Jan 2019](/posts/make-your-own-uvb-vitamin-d-lamp-for-40-dollars)** 

I turn around while in front of it for 3 minutes every day in the winter  and have 10 seconds on my face ~ 600 IU

I found that staying still would cause a "sun" burn in <1 minute

I also take 100,000 IU of vitamin D once every 4 days during all seasons

Have eyes closed while the lamp is on - the UVB will damage the eyes
