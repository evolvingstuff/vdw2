*  **Note: 70-80% were taking statins, which is known to [decrease vitamin D from the sun](/posts/statins-and-vitamin-d-many-studies)** 

*  **Speculation: Those patients who had a good level of vitamin D (> 40ng) at the start had gotten it from the sun.    
Statins will have greatly reduced their vitamin which they would get from the sun.    
There were no vitamin D measurements near the time of death to confirm or refute this hypothesis** 

* Wonder if long-term use of [baby aspirin by half ot adults > age 65](/posts/what-can-vitamin-d-learn-from-baby-aspirin) reduces vitamin D

* Wonder if long-term use of blood thinners reduces Vitamin D levels
