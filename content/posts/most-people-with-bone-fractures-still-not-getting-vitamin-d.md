#### Prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin d deficiency in the acute inpatient rehabilitation population and its effect on function.

Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2011 May;92(5):705-11.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) insufficiency and deficiency in the acute inpatient rehabilitation setting, identify risk factors associated with low serum 25(OH)D levels, and assess whether hypovitaminosis D affects the function of rehabilitation patients.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.

SETTING: Academic acute rehabilitation facility.

PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=101) admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation between September 2008 and December 2008.

INTERVENTIONS: Serum 25(OH)D levels drawn within 24 hours of admission.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 25(OH)D level, total/motor/cognitive FIM efficiency.

RESULTS: Considering patients not receiving 25(OH)D supplementation at the time of admission, 23.0% were 25(OH)D sufficient, 68.9% were insufficient, and 8.1% were deficient. Patients receiving 25(OH)D supplementation at the time of admission had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels than patients not receiving 25(OH)D supplementation (33.4±12.8 vs 23.7±11.4ng/mL; P=.001). A total of 72.2% of patients with any fracture and 80.0% of patients with fracture due to fall were not receiving supplementation at the time of admission; 72.2% of patients with any fracture and 73.3% of patients with fracture due to fall were 25(OH)D insufficient. Unadjusted total FIM efficiency scores were statistically significantly different by 25(OH)D status (2.96±1.42 vs 2.29±1.41ng/mL; P=.039). However, 25(OH)D level was not a significant predictor of total FIM efficiency score after controlling for demographic and clinical factors.

CONCLUSIONS: Of acute rehabilitation patients, 77% are 25(OH)D insufficient or deficient at admission. 25(OH)D supplementation is associated with a greater 25(OH)D level in these patients; however, almost half those supplemented had 25(OH)D levels less than the reference range. 

 **Most inpatients with fracture due to fall were transferred to acute inpatient rehabilitation without 25(OH)D supplementation despite clear guidelines indicating its use in this situation.**
