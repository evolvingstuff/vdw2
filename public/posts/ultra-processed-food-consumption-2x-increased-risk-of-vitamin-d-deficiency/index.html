Crude and adjusted binary logistic regression was applied to estimate the association between UPP consumption and vitamin D deficiency.

UPP contributed 19·9 % to the energetic intake of the participant&rsquo;s diet.  <strong>This contribution was higher for individuals with vitamin D deficiency</strong>  (22·5 %, P = 0·04).

#### 4 of the many many possible pathways that could result in this observation

1.  People eating UPP have lower income, and cannot afford  foods that have more vitamin D

1. People eating UPP have inflammation, which consumes vitamin D

1. People eating UPP  end up having poor guts which reduces absorbing nutrients such as Vitamin D

1. People eating UPP do not get outdoors as much
