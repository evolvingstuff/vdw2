Sibrizzi, MPH2; et alRobyn B. Blain, PhD2; Kristen Magnuson, MESM2; Pamela A. Hartman, MEM2; Andrew A. Rooney, PhD1; John R. Bucher, PhD1</p><p>Question Is fluoride exposure associated with children’s IQ scores?</p><p>Findings Despite differences in exposure and outcome measures and risk of bias across studies, and when using group-level and individual-level exposure estimates, this systematic review and meta-analysis of 74 cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies found significant inverse associations between fluoride exposure and children’s IQ scores. For fluoride measured in water, associations remained inverse when exposed groups were restricted to less than 4 mg/L or less than 2 mg/L but not when restricted to less than 1.5 mg/L; for fluoride measured in urine, associations remained inverse at less than 4 mg/L, less than 2 mg/L, and less than 1.5 mg/L; and among the subset of low risk-of-bias studies, there were inverse associations when exposed groups were restricted to less than 4 mg/L, less than 2 mg/L, and less than 1.5 mg/L for analyses of fluoride measured both in water and in urine.</p><p>Meaning This comprehensive meta-analysis may inform future risk-benefit assessments of the use of fluoride in children’s oral health.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Importance Previous meta-analyses suggest that fluoride exposure is adversely associated with children’s IQ scores. An individual’s total fluoride exposure comes primarily from fluoride in drinking water, food, and beverages.</p><p>Objective To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies investigating children’s IQ scores and prenatal or postnatal fluoride exposure.</p><p>Data Sources BIOSIS, Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CNKI, and Wanfang, searched through October 2023.</p><p>Study Selection Studies reporting children’s IQ scores, fluoride exposure, and effect sizes.</p><p>Data Extraction and Synthesis Data were extracted into the Health Assessment Workplace Collaborative system. Study quality was evaluated using the OHAT risk-of-bias tool. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and regression coefficients were estimated with random-effects models.</p><p>Main Outcomes and Measures Children’s IQ scores.</p><p>Results Of 74 studies included (64 cross-sectional and 10 cohort studies), most were conducted in China (n = 45); other locations included Canada (n = 3), Denmark (n = 1), India (n = 12), Iran (n = 4), Mexico (n = 4), New Zealand (n = 1), Pakistan (n = 2), Spain (n = 1), and Taiwan (n = 1). Fifty-two studies were rated high risk of bias and 22 were rated low risk of bias. Sixty-four studies reported inverse associations between fluoride exposure measures and children’s IQ. Analysis of 59 studies with group-level measures of fluoride in drinking water, dental fluorosis, or other measures of fluoride exposure (47 high risk of bias, 12 low risk of bias; n = 20 932 children) showed an inverse association between fluoride exposure and IQ (pooled SMD, −0.45; 95% CI, −0.57 to −0.33; P &lt; .001). In 31 studies reporting fluoride measured in drinking water, a dose-response association was found between exposed and reference groups (SMD, −0.15; 95% CI, −0.20 to −0.11; P &lt; .001), and associations remained inverse when exposed groups were restricted to less than 4 mg/L and less than 2 mg/L; however, the association was null at less than 1.5 mg/L. In analyses restricted to low risk-of-bias studies, the association remained inverse when exposure was restricted to less than 4 mg/L, less than 2 mg/L, and less than 1.5 mg/L fluoride in drinking water. In 20 studies reporting fluoride measured in urine, there was an inverse dose-response association (SMD, −0.15; 95% CI, −0.23 to −0.07; P &lt; .001). Associations remained inverse when exposed groups were restricted to less than 4 mg/L, less than 2 mg/L, and less than 1.5 mg/L fluoride in urine; the associations held in analyses restricted to the low risk-of-bias studies. Analysis of 13 studies with individual-level measures found an IQ score decrease of 1.63 points (95% CI, −2.33 to −0.93; P &lt; .001) per 1-mg/L increase in urinary fluoride. Among low risk-of-bias studies, there was an IQ score decrease of 1.14 points (95% CI, –1.68 to –0.61; P &lt; .001). Associations remained inverse when stratified by risk of bias, sex, age, outcome assessment type, country, exposure timing, and exposure matrix.</p><p>Conclusions and Relevance This systematic review and meta-analysis found inverse associations and a dose-response association between fluoride measurements in urine and drinking water and children’s IQ across the large multicountry epidemiological literature. There were limited data and uncertainty in the dose-response association between fluoride exposure and children’s IQ when fluoride exposure was estimated by drinking water alone at concentrations less than 1.5 mg/L. These findings may inform future comprehensive public health risk-benefit assessments of fluoride exposures.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fluoride-iq-jama.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=excess-fluoride-exposure-associated-with-lower-iq-in-children---jan-2025>Excess Fluoride Exposure Associated with Lower IQ in Children - Jan 2025</h5><p><strong><a href="https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/excess-fluoride-exposure-lowers-iq?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1119676&amp;post_id=154336988&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=ofo3r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Reporting on the JAMA study in Substack</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;On average, children&rsquo;s IQ scores were lower by an SMD of −0.45 ( <strong>~7 IQ points</strong> )&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>" In Europe, only Ireland, Poland, Serbia, Spain, and the UK fluoridate their water.<br><strong>Most developed countries do not consume artificially fluoridated water.</strong> "</p></li></ul></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384345"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384345",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384345"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384345"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384345"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384345"></script></body></html>
