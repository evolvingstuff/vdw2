INTRODUCTION: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) concentrations have been associated with radiologic worsening of osteoarthritis in some reports. However, the results are mixed and few studies have evaluated associations between 25(OH) D concentrations and both total vitamin D intake and clinical joint symptoms.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of information from a subset of 1993 postmenopausal women obtained at baseline entry in the Women's Health Initiative Calcium plus Vitamin D clinical trial.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 25(OH) D concentration, total vitamin D intake (diet plus supplements), presence and severity of joint pain and joint swelling.

RESULTS: The 25(OH) D levels were commonly low with 53% having deficient (<50nmol/L) and only 17% having sufficient (>72nmol/L) levels. Joint pain (reported by 74%) and joint swelling (reported by 34%) were also commonly reported. 25(OH) D concentrations were modestly correlated with total vitamin D intake (R=0.29, p<0.0001); however, considerable variability in 25(OH) D concentrations for a given vitamin D intake was seen. In adjusted linear regression models, lower serum 25(OH) D concentrations were associated with higher average joint pain score (P=0.01 for trend) with differences most apparent in the lowest 25(OH) D levels sextile.

CONCLUSIONS: Relatively low 25(OH) D levels and a high frequency of joint symptoms were common in this population of postmenopausal women.  **Total vitamin D intake was only modestly associated with 25(OH) D** . Low serum 25(OH) D concentrations were associated with higher joint pain scores. These findings can inform the design of future intervention trials.

# Vitamin D intake not associated with serum level?

1. Perhaps not enough vitamin D taken in to make a difference - no data

1. Perhaps RA consumes vitamin D - a <a href="/posts/vicious-cycle" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 889">vicious cycle</a> has not been identified for RA that we are aware of
