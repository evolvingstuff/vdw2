#### Acute calcitriol treatment mitigates vitamin D deficiency-associated mortality after intracerebral haemorrhage

Neurosci Lettrs 2024 Aug 8:137922. [doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2024.137922](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2024.137922)  **PDF behind paywall**

Objective: Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is emerging as a predictor of poor prognosis in various neurological conditions, where clinical outcomes are often worse in stroke patients with VDD. This study aimed to provide experimental evidence on whether and how pre-existing VDD would affect survival and neurofunctional outcomes in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), and to evaluate whether acute vitamin D (VD) supplementation would improve post-stroke outcomes.

Methods: Experimental ICH models were induced in mice with and without VDD. Haematoma size was measured using T2*-weighted MRI and haemoglobin concentration. Post-ICH mortality, neurofunctional outcomes and the extent of blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage were assessed to identify their correlations with VD status. Therapeutic benefits of acute VD administration were also evaluated.

Results: Mice with VDD exhibited significantly higher acute mortality rates and more severe motor deficits than mice without VDD post-ICH. Marked haematoma expansion and increased Evans blue extravasation were observed in VDD mice, suggesting that VDD was associated outcomes with increased BBB disruption. Acute treatment with a loading dose of VD (calcitriol) significantly improved outcomes in VDD mice.

Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms at play in ICH concomitant with VDD and a scientific rationale for acute treatment with VD.
