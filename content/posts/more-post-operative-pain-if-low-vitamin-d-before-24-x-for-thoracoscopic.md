#### Preoperative Vitamin D Level is Associated with Acute Pain After Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study

J Pain Res. 2022 Oct 12;15:3189-3196.[doi: 10.2147/JPR.S382407](https://doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S382407)

Purpose: Low vitamin D levels have been associated with musculoskeletal pain, cancer pain, chronic postoperative pain, and post-traumatic pain. However, their association with postoperative pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has not been explored. The aim of this study was to examine the association between vitamin D levels and postoperative pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

Patients and methods: This study enrolled 194 adult patients who underwent elective non-cardiac thoracic surgery in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital from February 2021 to June 2021. Following application of the exclusion criteria, 135 patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery were included in the final analysis. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute postoperative moderate-severe pain. Secondary outcomes included C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels in the immediate postoperative (48 hours) period, as well as pain scores at 3 months after surgery. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between vitamin D levels and acute postoperative moderate-severe pain.

Results: Among 135 patients, 54.1% were categorized as having a  **low vitamin D level (<30 nmol/L)** . On multivariable analysis, patients with a low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) level had a higher risk of postoperative moderate-severe pain (odds ratio, **2.44;**  95% confidence interval, 1.181-5.041; P = 0.016) when compared to patients with a sufficient 25(OH)D level. Static and dynamic pain scores at 3 months after surgery, as well as serum levels of CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were not significantly different between patients with low and sufficient 25(OH)D levels.

Conclusion: Patients with low vitamin D levels are at a higher risk of acute moderate-severe pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
