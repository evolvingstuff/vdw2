The global prevalence of eye diseases continues to grow, bringing with it a reduction in the activity levels and quality of life of patients, and partial or complete blindness if left untreated. As such, there is considerable interest in identifying more effective therapeutic options and preventive agents. One such agent is vitamin D, known to have a range of anti-cancer, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, and whose deficiency is linked to the pathogenesis of a range of cardiovascular, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. This review presents the current stage of knowledge concerning the link between vitamin D and its receptor and the occurrence of eye disease, as well as the influence of analogues of calcitriol, an active metabolite of vitamin D. Generally, patients affected by various ocular disorders have vitamin D deficiency. In addition, previous findings suggest that vitamin D modulates the course of eye diseases and may serve as a marker, and that its supplementation could mitigate some disorders. However, as these studies have some limitations, we recommend further randomized trials to clarify the link between vitamin D and its activity with eye disease.
