#### Supplements: taken daily through once a week

(Manufacturer - typically a popular one on Amazon)

 **Daily** 

* [Orgain Protein - 76 cents/ounce](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J074W7Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) I also add very intense exercise for 15 minutes daily to build muscle

   * It tastes great. (age 78), average 30 g/day

   * Apparently should have >80 grams TOTAL per day (>1 gram/kg  @ 80 kg) 

* Calcium (not rock Calcium, but Calcium from plants) 

   * [Red Marine Algae](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CZ1RBVB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) I sprinkle about 1/2 gram on my morning oatmeal and then add hot water

   * Red Marine Algae is 32% Calcium by weight. so I get 170 mg

   * Calcium from Algae is [1.6 X more bio-available](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-calcium-from-plants-and-ani-SVCsf2igT5e8rhCvF76RHw) than Calcium from rocks  (My 170 mg ==> 280 mg of bio-available Calcium)

   * I also get organic  Calcium from cheese, kale, and yogurt -no rock Calcium

* Magnesium Citrate 200 mg daily [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EUS48O2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20)  &nbsp; <span style="color:#06F;">Co-Factor✻</span> and <span style="color:#F00;">VDR activate✻</span>

   * Had previously made Mg water so as to get >1200 mg/day, but appear not to need that much

   * To 500 ml of hot water add 32 grams of [Magnesium Chloride](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078JCJ58R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) and 21 grams of [D-Ribose](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JNFGDUI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) (to cancel the sour taste of Mg) 

   * add 50 ml of the Mg water (above) to 350ml of water and sip during the day

      * This amount provides about 150 mg of Mg daily - which appears to be enough for me

      * I have tried up to 1200 mg of Mg daily for weeks, but I did not notice any benefit

      * The Magnesium Chloride + D-Ribose will make enough Mg water to drink for many years

* Caffine [Amazon 167 mg capsule 14 cents](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IRFX4NY?) similar to 1 cup of coffee

 **Every 2 days** 

* Vitamin K -  **<span style="color:#06F;">Co-Factor✻</span>**  3 types in [Super K](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RL1J9BV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20)

   * Should be eaten with a fatty meal. Am looking for a water-dispersible form of K2

* [Glutathione](/posts/glutathione-and-vitamin-d-synergism-many-studies) - the master anti-oxidant, can start with 2 daily for a month [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXWXLD5G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20)

* Vitamin B100 8 types (Horbaach)

* Vitamin C liposomal [Amazon - extremely popular](https://www.amazon.com/Nutrivein-Liposomal-Vitamin-1400mg-Antioxidant/dp/B07K8QLGHN/ref=sr_1_1_pp?tag=vdw-20)

* Silicon - [Bamboo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7B63LHL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) - for better teeth and bones 

 **Every 3 days** 

* Resveratrol <span style="color:#F00;">VDR activate✻</span> (Nature's Essentials 10X more bio-available) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MW93GCZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-2)

* Tumeric/Curcumin <span style="color:#F00;">VDR activate✻</span> (A1Vitality)

 **Every 4 days** 

* Vitamin D3  100,000 IU - [Bio-Tech 50,000 IU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0F2B2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) This brand does NOT need to be taken with a fatty meal

   * avoid taking a few hours before trying to sleep - it is, after all, sometimes called the Sunshine Vitamin

* Quercetin <span style="color:#F00;">VDR activate✻</span> [Jarrow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OULOC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) 500 mg

* Boron <span style="color:#06F;">Co-Factor✻</span>  - for better teeth and bones [Swanson Triple 3mg](https://www.amazon.com/Swanson-Complex-Support-Supplement-Capsules/dp/B07F92W9MK/ref=sr_1_1?tag=vdw-20) Amazon

* Selenium (Piping Rock 200 mcg)

 **Every 6 days** 

* Iron  [Proferin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MJPVZC6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20)

 **Every 7 days** 

* Zinc - **<span style="color:#06F;">Co-Factor✻</span>**  (Spring Valley 50 mg)

   * I occasionally also take sublingual Zinc with Vitamin C every two hours to fight off colds ([Nature's Way](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024D3SK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20))

* Iodine - a few crystals (AZ Labs)

* Vitamin B-12 5 mg - alertness, energy (Vitamatic 5000 mcg, sublingual)

* Omega-3  **<span style="color:#06F;">Co-Factor✻</span>**  -  trying it weekly instead of daily 

* Many brands - I am trying [Omega-3 (EPA 350 mg + DHA 250 mg)  + Vitamin D3 5,000 IU](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T8K9NHC?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1) Amazon

   * Note: - [weekly proven to be better than daily for rats](/posts/omega-3-weekly-is-more-bio-available-than-daily-rat-study)

   * Note many other Omega-3 products are lower cost, but I wanted to try out the combination for VitaminDWiki readers

   * [Coromega](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M03VMSJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?tag=vdw-20) - tastes great, does not require a fatty meal - used it when I had Omega-3 daily

   * Must also decrease Omega-6 to get the benefit from Omega-3: See [Omega-3 index home test](/posts/omega-3-index-many-studies)

 **When I need a quick boost of energy, several times a year** 

[Nanoemulsion vitamin D](/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-is-faster-and-better-many-studies) swished in my mouth - I feel the benefit in <15 minutes

 **When I have restricted breathing due to my exercise-induced asthma, several times a month** 

[Inhale vitamin D](/posts/inhaled-vitamin-d-help-lungs-many-studies) - which I designed - using only 2 items purchased on Amazon

Amazingly, about 500 IU of vitamin D greatly improves my breathing in <5 minutes

 **When I feel that intense exercise would otherwise make me feel tired later that day or the next, about weekly** 

[Drink D-Ribose](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JNFGDUI?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1) - which quickly boosts ATP production

I buy it in bulk - 15 cents per serving

Also great for recovering from orgasm - have used since about age 65  (age 79 as of 2025)
