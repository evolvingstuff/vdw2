#### Relationship in development of malocclusions to polymorphisms of selected vitamin D receptors

Adv Clin Exp Med. 2024 Feb 14. [https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/169977](https://doi.org/10.17219/acem/169977) PDF behind a paywall

Background: The development of malocclusion is related to various factor, many of which are still not fully explained. The steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has pleiotropic effects. It plays a key role in skeletal metabolism and the control of cell repair by attaching to the nuclear vitamin D steroid receptor (VDR). This vitamin affects bone turnover through the processes of bone tissue formation and resorption via its action on cells of the osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineage, exerts a modulating effect on the immune system, and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The role of vitamin D3 (VD3) and its receptor polymorphisms is a rarely studied topic in dentistry. Due to the proven influence on bone turnover processes and immune responses, the main research topic is its relation to periodontal diseases, but so far, its role in the formation and development of malocclusions has not been assessed.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess the association of selected VDR polymorphisms: Cdx2 (rs11658820), TaqI (rs7975232), BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), and FokI (rs2228570) with the development of malocclusions.

Material and methods: A prospective observational study was performed. The examination consisted of a medical interview, intraand extraoral orthodontic diagnosis, alginate impression, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and venous blood sample to obtain genomic DNA and assess VDR polymorphisms.

Results: The rs11658820 polymorphism causes an  **almost 4-fold**  increase in the probability of the presence of a malocclusion. GT and TT genotypes of rs7975232 are also associated with a similar risk -  **almost 6 and almost 5 times higher** , respectively. In turn, the effect of the rs2228570-AG and GG genotype polymorphisms on the occurrence of transversal anomalies was demonstrated (odds ratio (OR) = **8.46 and OR = 6.92** , respectively).

Conclusions: The association of individual polymorphisms with specific malocclusions should be carefully assessed, especially since some trends have been indicated.

#### Malocclusion 5X more likely if low Vitamin D - June 2021

 **Could Vitamin D3 Deficiency Influence Malocclusion Development?** 

Nutrients 2021, 13(6), 2122; [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu1306212](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu1306212) FREE PDF

The abnormal growth of the craniofacial bone leads to skeletal and dental defects, which result in the presence of malocclusions. Not all causes of malocclusion have been explained. In the development of skeletal abnormalities, attention is paid to general deficiencies, including of vitamin D3 (VD3), which causes rickets. Its chronic deficiency may contribute to skeletal malocclusion. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of VD3 deficiency on the development of malocclusions. The examination consisted of a medical interview, oral examination, an alginate impression and radiological imaging, orthodontic assessment, and taking a venous blood sample for VD3 level testing. In about 42.1% of patients, the presence of a skeletal defect was found, and in 46.5% of patients, dentoalveolar malocclusion. The most common defect was transverse constriction of the maxilla with a narrow upper arch (30.7%). The concentration of vitamin 25 (OH) D in the study group was on average 23.6 ± 10.5 (ng/mL). VD3 deficiency was found in 86 subjects (75.4%). 

Our research showed that VD3 deficiency could be one of an important factor influencing maxillary development. Patients had a greater risk of a 

* narrowed upper arch (OR = 4.94), 

* crowding (OR = 4.94) and 

* crossbite (OR = 6.16). 

Thus, there was a link between the deficiency of this hormone and the underdevelopment of the maxilla.

!!!!Relationship in development of malocclusions to polymorphisms of selected vitamin D receptors

Background: The development of malocclusion is related to various factor, many of which are still not fully explained. The steroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, has pleiotropic effects. It plays a key role in skeletal metabolism and the control of cell repair by attaching to the nuclear vitamin D steroid receptor (VDR). This vitamin affects bone turnover through the processes of bone tissue formation and resorption via its action on cells of the osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineage, exerts a modulating effect on the immune system, and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The role of vitamin D3 (VD3) and its receptor polymorphisms is a rarely studied topic in dentistry. Due to the proven influence on bone turnover processes and immune responses, the main research topic is its relation to periodontal diseases, but so far, its role in the formation and development of malocclusions has not been assessed.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess the association of selected VDR polymorphisms: Cdx2 (rs11658820), TaqI (rs7975232), BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), and FokI (rs2228570) with the development of malocclusions.

Material and methods: A prospective observational study was performed. The examination consisted of a medical interview, intraand extraoral orthodontic diagnosis, alginate impression, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and venous blood sample to obtain genomic DNA and assess VDR polymorphisms.

Results: The rs11658820 polymorphism causes an __almost 4-fold__ increase in the probability of the presence of a malocclusion. GT and TT genotypes of rs7975232 are also associated with a similar risk - __almost 6 and almost 5 times higher__, respectively. In turn, the effect of the rs2228570-AG and GG genotype polymorphisms on the occurrence of transversal anomalies was demonstrated (odds ratio (OR) =__ 8.46 and OR = 6.92__, respectively).

Conclusions: The association of individual polymorphisms with specific malocclusions should be carefully assessed, especially since some trends have been indicated.

__Could Vitamin D3 Deficiency Influence Malocclusion Development? __

The abnormal growth of the craniofacial bone leads to skeletal and dental defects, which result in the presence of malocclusions. Not all causes of malocclusion have been explained. In the development of skeletal abnormalities, attention is paid to general deficiencies, including of vitamin D3 (VD3), which causes rickets. Its chronic deficiency may contribute to skeletal malocclusion. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of VD3 deficiency on the development of malocclusions. The examination consisted of a medical interview, oral examination, an alginate impression and radiological imaging, orthodontic assessment, and taking a venous blood sample for VD3 level testing. In about 42.1% of patients, the presence of a skeletal defect was found, and in 46.5% of patients, dentoalveolar malocclusion. The most common defect was transverse constriction of the maxilla with a narrow upper arch (30.7%). The concentration of vitamin 25 (OH) D in the study group was on average 23.6 ± 10.5 (ng/mL). VD3 deficiency was found in 86 subjects (75.4%). 
Our research showed that VD3 deficiency could be one of an important factor influencing maxillary development. Patients had a greater risk of a 
*narrowed upper arch (OR = 4.94), 
*crowding (OR = 4.94) and 
*crossbite (OR = 6.16). 
Thus, there was a link between the deficiency of this hormone and the underdevelopment of the maxilla.
