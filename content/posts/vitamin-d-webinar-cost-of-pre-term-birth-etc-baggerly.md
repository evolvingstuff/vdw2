#### $51,800 = cost of pre-term birth

20 = number needed to treat to prevent one pr-term birth

$ 2590 = Cost savings averaged over 20 pregnancies

 **VitaminDWiki computes that $80 of prevention would save $51,800 (A 600X Return on Investment)** 

* half as many pre-term births when there is enough Vitamin D

* 10% of all births are pre-term

* Thus, must give vitamin D to 20 women to prevent one pre-term birth

* Cost per woman for vitamin D during pregnancy is about $4

* Thus  **$80 ($4 X 20) would save $51,800**
