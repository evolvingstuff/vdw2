# Ontario Proposes Evidenced-Based Changes To Vitamin D Testing

August 13, 2010 

McGuinty Government Moves Forward On Excellent Care for All Act

Ontario is listening to expert medical advice and proposing to curb unnecessary Vitamin D testing for otherwise healthy people.

In June, Ontario's Health Technology Advisory Committee concluded that the routine use of Vitamin D testing for the general population could not be justified based on current evidence.  This builds on other recent medical expert evidence that recommended changes to sleep studies, bone mineral density and pre-operative testing for cataract surgery.

Since 2004, Vitamin D testing has grown by 2,500 per cent - jumping from 29,000 tests to over 700,000 in 2009.  Moving toward evidence based testing supports Ontario's Excellent Care for All agenda to ensure health care investments are getting results and improving patient care. The proposed change to Vitamin D testing would result in resources being redirected to other laboratory services.

The province would continue to cover Vitamin D testing for patients where medical evidence indicates there is a need.  Ontario would continue to fund tests for patients with medical conditions such as Osteoporosis, Rickets, Osteopenia, Malabsorption Syndromes and Renal Disease.  Ontarians who are on medications that affect Vitamin D metabolism would also still be covered. 

The public is invited to comment on the proposed change to Vitamin D testing which will be posted on Ontario's regulatory registry until September 26. 

In June, Ontario passed the Excellent Care for All Act, which lays the foundation for these improvements and is part of the Open Ontario Plan to improve the quality and value of health care.

Ontario is trying to find ways to curb runaway health costs – 46 per cent of the provincial budget is spent on healthcare. 

Not only will cutting vitamin D testing for anyone who asks save the province about $64 million a year Matthews said it will be one less thing for the province’s burdened medical laboratories to deal with.

The health ministry has recently cut some bone mineral density and pre-operative testing for cataract surgery.
