Background and aims: Vitamin D is known to influence the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is a recognized risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). However, the relationship between vitamin D and SCA is not well understood. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between vitamin D and SCA in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients compared to healthy controls.

Methods and results: Using the Phase II Cardiac Arrest Pursuit Trial with Unique Registration and Epidemiologic Surveillance (CAPTURES II) registry, a 1:1 propensity score-matched case-control study was conducted between 2017 and 2020. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) levels in patients with OHCA (454 cases) and healthy controls (454 cases) were compared after matching for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and lifestyle behaviors.  **The mean vitamin D levels were 14.5 ± 7.6 and 21.3 ± 8.3 ng/mL among SCA cases and controls** , respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle behaviors, corrected serum calcium levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGRF). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for vitamin D was 0.89 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 0.87-0.91). The dose-response relationship demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was associated with SCA incidence (severe deficiency,  **aOR 10.87** , 95% CI 4.82-24.54; moderate deficiency, aOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.20-4.20).

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was independently and strongly associated with an increased risk of SCA, irrespective of cardiovascular and lifestyle factors, corrected calcium levels, and eGFR.
