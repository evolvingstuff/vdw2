 **To our knowledge, there have not been studies to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)** .

To test in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and prospective way whether 8 weeks of 600,000 IU monthly supplementation of oral vitamin D3 would contribute to improvements in RP, 53 patients describing RP were recruited during the winter of 2010-2011.

42 patients were deficient in vitamin D dosage and  **randomly assigned**  into either the vitamin D group or placebo group.

Every 4 weeks (for a total of 3 doses), patients received their treatment and answered on a visual analog scale (VAS) basis about their RP.

In the vitamin D group, the baseline average blood vitamin D level was 20.9 ng/mL. VAS 0, VAS 1, and VAS 2 were 58.33, 48.09, and  **36.2** , respectively.

At the end of the study, the average blood vitamin D level was 32.9 ng/mL.

In the placebo group, the baseline average blood vitamin D level was 21.8 ng/mL. VAS 0, VAS 1, and VAS 2 were 58.33, 51.19, and  **64.28** , respectively.

At the end of the study, the average blood vitamin D level was 23.2 ng/mL.

Following our observations, we concluded an objective augmentation of vitamin D blood level and RP self-judgment improvement after 8 weeks of monthly supplementation of vitamin D3.

 **One can ask whether vitamin D has a vasodilator effect in patients with RP who are deficient in vitamin D.** 

Other studies and research are needed to answer these questions.

#### RP who had vitamin D levels restored needed less Vasodilator treatment - April 2022

Primary Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is resultant of transient vasospasm of peripheral arteries and arterioles and is usually precipitated by cold exposure or emotional stress, without any clue for autoimmune connective tissue diseases. We aimed to determine the frequency of vitamin D and B12 deficiencies in pediatric patients with primary RP and to investigate their roles in the disease course. Vitamin B12 and D were supplemented if the patients had deficiencies. The study included 40 children with primary RP, 29 (72.5%) female and 11 (27.5%) male. The mean and median ages were 15.1 ± 1.8 and 15.5 (range, 11.5–17.8) years. Symptoms were improved in 31 (77.5%) patients with warming procedures. Seventeen (41.5%) and 16 (39%) patients had low serum vitamin B12 and D levels, respectively. Vasodilator treatment requirement did not change by vitamin B12 status but was significantly lower in vitamin D deficient and replaced patients. Further studies are needed to clarify our results.
