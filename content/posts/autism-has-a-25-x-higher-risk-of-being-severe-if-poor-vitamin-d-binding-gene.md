#### Impact of gene polymorphisms involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway on the susceptibility to and severity of autism spectrum disorder

Nature  scientific reports volume 14, Article number: 28333 (2024) [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79994-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-79994-9)

This study explores the association between genetic variations in the vitamin D pathway and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility and severity in Thai children. A total of 276 participants, including 169 children with ASD and 107 healthy controls, were recruited. Genotyping of vitamin D pathway genes (CYP2R1, CYP27B1, GC, and VDR) was conducted using TaqMan-based real-time PCR, while serum vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay. ASD severity was assessed via the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, 2nd Edition. Results reveal that the VDR gene (ApaI) rs7975232 is linked to a reduced ASD risk. In contrast, the GC gene rs7041 (A > C) polymorphism shows a significant association with increased ASD risk and severity, particularly in individuals with both the GC gene polymorphism and vitamin D insufficiency. Additionally, there was a higher prevalence of the GC1s isoform and GC1s-GC1s haplotype in children with ASD, associated with ASD severity. This study identified that individuals possessing GC rs7041 C alleles and the GC1s genotype (rs7041C/rs4588G) exhibit an increased susceptibility to and more severity of ASD. Further studies with larger cohorts are essential to fully understand these genetic polymorphisms’ roles.
