 **Fact: People with poor immune systems have been survived to become parents for 150 years  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;poor  hygene, no antibiotics, no vaccines, etc used toeliminatel 30% of potential parents  
Appears that: More people now have poor immune systems  
Fact: Poor Vitamin D genes are one aspect of a poor immune system  
Fact: Obesity is associated with many different poor vitamin D genes  
SPECULATION: Increased obesity is associated with poor vitamin D genetics**
