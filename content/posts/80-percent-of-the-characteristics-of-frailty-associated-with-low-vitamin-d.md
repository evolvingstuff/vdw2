BACKGROUND: Poor vitamin D status and frailty are common in older people and associated with adverse health outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and frailty and components of frailty in older Australian men.

METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project, a large epidemiological study conducted in Sydney, Australia, between January 2005 and May 2007. 

Participants included 1,659 community-dwelling men. 

Main outcome measurements were frailty (assessed using the Cardiovascular Health Study), frailty criteria comprising five core components: 

* weight loss; 

* reduced muscular strength/weakness; 

* slow walking speed; 

* exhaustion; and 

* low activity level, 

and the separate components of frailty. Covariates included serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels measured by radioimmunoassay, age, country of birth, season of blood collection, sun exposure, body mass index, vitamin D supplement use, income, measures of health, parathyroid hormone, estimated glomerular function.

RESULTS: Frailty was present in 9.2% of the sample. 

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were independently associated with frailty and with four of the five components of frailty (except weight loss).

CONCLUSIONS: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were independently associated with frailty in older men. 

This suggests that there might be a number of different biological mechanisms for how low vitamin D status might contribute to the frailty syndrome.

In addition, the possibility that improving vitamin D status may specifically influence the incidence and progression of frailty needs to be explored.

#### Low vitamin D status is an independent predictor of increased frailty and all-cause mortality in older men: the Health In Men Study - 2013

Context and objective: Hypovitaminosis D and frailty are common in the older population. 

We aimed to determine whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations are associated with frailty and mortality.

Design: Prospective cohort study.

Setting and participants: 4203 older men aged 70–88 years in Perth, Western Australia

Main outcome measures: 25(OH)D was measured by immunoassay. Frailty was assessed with the 5-point FRAIL (Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness and Loss of weight) scale. Mortality was determined from the death registry via the Western Australian Data Linkage System.

Results: At baseline, 676 (16.1%) men were frail, as defined by having ≥3 deficits (FRAIL scale ≥ 3). In multivariate cross-sectional analysis, low vitamin D status, defined by the lowest quartile of 25(OH)D values (<52.9 nmol/l), was associated with increased prevalent frailty (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> 1.96, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 1.52 to 2.52) in comparison to the highest quartile of 25(OH)D values (>81.6 nmol/l). After a mean period of 5.3 years, the adjusted odds ratio of being frail at follow-up for men with low vitamin D and having zero deficit at baseline (FRAIL scale = 0) was 1.56 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.27). Low vitamin D also predicted all-cause mortality over a period of up to 9.2 years (hazards ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42), independent of baseline frailty and other covariates.

 **Conclusion: Hypovitaminosis D is associated with prevalent and incident frailty in older men.** 

Hypovitaminosis D also predicts all-cause mortality, independent of frailty. 

The association between vitamin D and mortality is not solely dependent on the occurrence of frailty.
