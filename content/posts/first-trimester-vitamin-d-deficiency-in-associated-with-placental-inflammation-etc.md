#### Severe vitamin D deficiency in the first trimester is associated with placental inflammation in high-risk singleton pregnancy.

 **This study considered just those women who associated with high risk pregnancies  
Not clear if associated determination was made before or after pregnancy  
Vitamin D deficiency level is defined as <11 ng in text, but < 8 ng in chart** 

 **| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Neonatal sepsis | Fetal intrauterine infection |
| Placental Inflammation | 2.4 % | 15.6 % |
| No Placental Inflammation | 0.5 % | 5.7 % |** 

 **Note:** 

Typical vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy starts in middle of first trimester

It is unlikely that supplementation without loading dosing would provide much benefit during first trimester
