**Phages kill off bad bacteria, making room for the good bacteria in probiotics  
Bio-availability of various nutrients, such as vitamin D, is increased with good bacteria  
Probiotics have been used in the gut for a long time  
Gut probiotics has been augmented with phages  
Probiotics has been used in various respiratory problems for some years now  
Use of phages in the respiratory system is a new area of study (2017)**
