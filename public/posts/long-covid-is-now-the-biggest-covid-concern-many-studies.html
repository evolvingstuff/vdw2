To gain a deeper understanding of the etiology and long-term progression of symptoms, this study aims to analyze the prevalence of Long COVID and its associated factors in a cohort of Brazilian adults and elders, twelve months after hospital discharge. An observational, prospective, and follow-up study was performed with a cohort of adults and older adults diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2020 in the State of Paraná, Brazil. Twelve months after hospital discharge, patients answered a <strong>phone questionnaire</strong> about the persistence of symptoms after three levels of exposure to COVID-19’s acute phase (ambulatory, medical ward, and intensive care unit). According to the characteristics of participants, the prevalence of Long COVID-19 was calculated, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. We analyzed data from 1822 participants (980 adults <span>[≥18–&lt;60 years]</span> and 842 older people <span>[≥60 years]</span>) across three exposure levels. <strong>The overall Long COVID prevalence was 64.2%.</strong> Long COVID was observed in 646 adults (55%; of which 326 were women) and 523 older people (45%; of which 284 were women). Females had a higher prevalence of long-term symptoms (52%) compared with men. The most common post-COVID-19 conditions in the 12-month follow-up were neurological (49.8%), followed by musculoskeletal (35.1%) and persistent respiratory symptoms (26.5%). Male individuals were less likely to develop Long COVID (aOR = 0.50). Other determinants were also considered risky, such as the presence of comorbidities (aOR = 1.41). Being an adult and having been hospitalized was associated with the development of Long COVID. The risk of developing Long COVID was twice as high for ward patients (aOR = 2.53) and three times as high for ICU patients (aOR = 3.56) when compared to non-hospitalized patients. Presenting clinical manifestations of digestive (aOR = 1.56), endocrine (aOR = 2.14), cutaneous (aOR = 2.51), musculoskeletal (aOR = 2.76) and psychological systems (aOR = 1.66) made adults more likely to develop Long COVID. Long COVID was present in a large proportion of people affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presence of Long COVID symptoms displayed a dose–response relationship with the level of disease exposure, with a greater prevalence of symptoms associated with the severe form in the acute period.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/long-covid-brazil-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=some-early-long-covid-symptoms-persist-for-at-least-3-years-in-us-veterans--may-2024>Some early Long-COVID symptoms persist for at least 3 years in US veterans – May 2024</h4><p><strong><a href=/posts/some-early-long-covid-symptoms-persist-for-at-least-3-years-in-us-veterans>Some early Long-COVID symptoms persist for at least 3 years in US veterans – May 2024</a></strong></p><p><strong>Note: Might be different for people who are younger or older, or after later COVID variants</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/some-initial-long-covid-still-persist-for-3-years.webp alt=image width=700>

Fifty long COVID and 50 non–long-COVID subjects matched on a 1:1 basis were enrolled from an outpatient clinic post-COVID cohort seen from August to November 2020. Therapies/comorbidities affecting calcium/vitamin D/bone metabolism, and/or admission to the intensive care unit during hospitalization were exclusion criteria. 25(OH) Vitamin D was measured at hospital admission and 6 months after discharge.</p><p>Results</p><p>We observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels, evaluated at follow-up, in subjects with long COVID than those without (20.1 vs 23.2 ng/mL, P = .03). Regarding the affected health areas evaluated in the entire cohort, we observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels in those with neurocognitive symptoms at follow-up (n = 7) than those without (n = 93) (14.6 vs 20.6 ng/mL, P = .042). In patients presenting vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL), both at admission and at follow-up (n = 42), those affected by long COVID (n = 22) presented lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels at follow-up than those not affected (n = 20) (12.7 vs 15.2 ng/mL, P = .041). In multiple regression analyses, lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels at follow-up were the only variable significantly associated with long COVID in our cohort (P = .008, OR 1.09, CI 1.01-1.16).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>COVID-19 survivors with long COVID have lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels than matched patients without long COVID. Our data suggest that vitamin D levels should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. The role of vitamin D supplementation as a preventive strategy of COVID-19 sequelae should be tested in randomized controlled trials.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/long-covid-oct-2023-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z43R1Y1Z38I&amp;ab_channel=WhiteboardDoctor">~~#00F:YouTube 20 minute video reporting on this study</a>~~</strong></p><hr><h4 id=long-covid-22x-more-likely-if-had-2-covid-vaccinations---dec-2022>Long-COVID 2.2X more-likely if had 2 COVID vaccinations - Dec 2022</h4><p><strong><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/two-doses-vaccine-long-covid/?utm_source=luminate&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=defender&amp;utm_id=20240105">Children&rsquo;s Health Defense</a> Jan 2024</strong></p><p>Reporting on peer-reviewed study: <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278825>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0278825</a>   <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/characteristics-and-predictors-of-long-covid-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p><p><strong>Characteristics and predictors of Long COVID among diagnosed cases of COVID-19</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Association</td><td>Rate</td></tr><tr><td>2 COVID-19 vaccination</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-existing medical conditions</td><td>2X</td></tr><tr><td>Having a higher number of symptoms<br>during acute phase of COVID-19 disease</td><td>11X</td></tr><tr><td>Severity of illness</td><td>5.7</td></tr><tr><td>Admitted to hospital</td><td>3.9</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id=long-covid-100-gone-in-29-of-long-covid-patients-after-histamin-treatment-mast-cells---march-2024>Long-COVID 100% gone in 29% of long-COVID patients after histamin treatment (mast cells) - March 2024</h4><p><strong><a href=https://impactofvitamind.com/long-covid-mast-cell-activation-and-finding-a-way-out/>LONG COVID, MAST CELL ACTIVATION, AND FINDING A WAY OUT</a> Eugene Hayden</strong></p><ul><li><p>In the treatment of MCAD, to calm down the inappropriate activation of the mast cell, the drug montelukast (Singular) could be added to the regime.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystem illness caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can manifest with a multitude of symptoms in the setting of end-organ damage, though it is predominantly respiratory. However, various symptoms may remain after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is referred to as “Long COVID” (LC). Patients with LC may develop multi-organ symptom complex that remains 4–12 weeks after the acute phase of illness, with symptoms intermittently persisting over time. The main symptoms are fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and limitation of functional capacity. Pediatric patients developed the main symptoms of LC like those described in adults, although there may be variable presentations of LC in children. The underlying mechanisms of LC are not clearly known, although they may involve pathophysiological changes generated by virus persistence, immunological alterations secondary to virus–host interaction, tissue damage of inflammatory origin and hyperactivation of coagulation. Risk factors for developing LC would be female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnea, previous psychiatric disorders, and alterations in immunological, inflammatory and coagulation parameters. There is currently no specific treatment for LC, but it could include pharmacological treatments to treat symptoms, supplements to restore nutritional, metabolic, and gut flora balance, and functional treatments for the most disabling symptoms. In summary, this study aims to show the scientific community the current knowledge of LC.
