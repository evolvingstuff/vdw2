#### Correlation between gynecological tumors and atherosclerotic diseases

Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis. 2023 Dec 30:8:e118-e122. [doi: 10.5114/amsad/176655](https://doi.org/10.5114/amsad/176655)

Gynecological cancer is among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with malignancies of the 

* ovary, 

* uterus, 

* fallopian tube, 

* cervix, 

* vagina, and 

* vulva 

making up 10-18% of all cancers diagnosed in women globally. 

Gynecological cancer and atherosclerosis are two of the most frequent medical entities that afflict women worldwide; thus the possible correlations between them ought to be explored. Vulvar, cervical, vaginal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers have been found to have common points with atherosclerosis regarding their pathogenesis and predisposing factors. 

* Obesity and metabolic syndrome, 

* HPV infection, 

* vitamin D deficiency, and 

* increased telomere length

constitute common ground between these two afflictions, which this article aims to analyze.
