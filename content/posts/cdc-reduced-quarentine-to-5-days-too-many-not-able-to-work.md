#### Note: CDC is NOT following the science

* CDC does not suggest testing at end of the period

* No isolation time if had been boosted (jab #3 for now)

* US Isolation time had been 15 days, then 10 days, now 5 days. How long till 3 days?

* :“We know that those who are vaccinated, and those who were previously infected and vaccinated, are more likely to shed virus for shorter periods of time,"

   * "Since 22 December, people in England who have tested positive for Covid have been allowed to cut their self-isolation from 10 days to seven if they have negative lateral flow tests on days six and day seven."

   * 14 days Germany; 10- days Scotland, Wales, France 

   * Suspect immunosurpressed, elderly (low vitamin D) are infectious much longer

* "Including a testing requirement after five days would be an improvement, Caballero said, but “it does not address the limitations around rapid antigen tests — they are less sensitive and less able to pick up asymptomatic cases.”"
