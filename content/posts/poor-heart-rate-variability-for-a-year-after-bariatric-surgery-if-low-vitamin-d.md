#### Normalization of Cardiac Function After Bariatric Surgery Is Related to Autonomic Function and Vitamin D

Obes Surg . 2022 Nov 5. [doi: 10.1007/s11695-022-06336-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-022-06336-x)

Purpose: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction is common in patients with obesity. Bariatric surgery is associated with normalization of subclinical cardiac function in 50% of the patients with obesity. The aim of this study was to identify predictors for a lack of improvement of subclinical cardiac dysfunction 1-year post-bariatric surgery.

Methods: Patients who were referred for bariatric surgery were enrolled in a longitudinal study. Inclusion criteria were age 35-65 years and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2. Patients with a suspicion of or known cardiovascular disease were excluded. Conventional and advanced echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and blood tests were performed pre- and 1-year post-bariatric surgery. Subclinical cardiac dysfunction was defined as either a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, decreased global longitudinal strain (GLS), diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmia, or an increased BNP or hs Troponin I.

Results: A total of 99 patients were included of whom 59 patients had cardiac dysfunction at baseline. Seventy-two patients completed the 1-year follow-up after bariatric surgery. There was a significant reduction in weight and cardiovascular risk factors. Parameters of cardiac function, such as GLS, improved. However, in 20 patients cardiac dysfunction persisted. Multivariate analysis identified a decreased heart rate variability (which is a measure of autonomic function), and a decreased vitamin D pre-surgery as predictors for subclinical cardiac dysfunction after bariatric surgery.

Conclusion: Although there was an overall improvement of cardiac function 1-year post-bariatric surgery, autonomic dysfunction and a decreased vitamin D pre-bariatric surgery were predictors for a lack of improvement of subclinical cardiac dysfunction.
