   * Can just take a 50,000 IU dose [2 or 4 times a month](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

   * Alternately, just add Vitamin D to food/beverage to be consumed over 2-4 weeks

1.  **Worry that the pill casing may be made from animals** 

   * Many companies, such as:[1](https://www.amazon.com/D3-50-Vegetable-Vitamin-Cholecalciferol-Capsule/dp/B07NCYF6MN/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1ISAYXWQDRSIE&keywords=biotech+pharmacal+d3+50%2C000&qid=1702480533&sprefix=biotech+pha%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-3) [2](https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Innovations-Pharmacal-Vitamin-D3-50-000/dp/B089RWV1FS/ref=sr_1_5?crid=4S8ADVOUVSWP&keywords=vitamin+d3+50%2C000+vegan&qid=1702480673&sprefix=vitamin+d3+50%2C000+vegan%2Caps%2C130&sr=8-5) make capsules that are not made from animals

1.  **Worry that animals might have been killed to make vitamin D** 

   * Some companies such as: [1](https://www.amazon.com/NatureWise-Vegan-Vitamin-000-Gummies/dp/B0CJ4CNGZ2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=42M4079L52SF&keywords=%22vitamin+d%22+vegan&qid=1702473805&sprefix=vitamin+d+vegan%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1) [2](https://www.amazon.com/Naturalis-Vitamin-Support-Certified-Softgels/dp/B0BFM7NKNM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=28AJIKTK8AJ5T&keywords=%22vitamin%2Bd%22%2Bvegan%2B50%2C000&qid=1702473840&sprefix=vitamin%2Bd%2Bvegan%2B50%2C000%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) [3](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Capsules-Non-GMO-Strengthen-Function/dp/B086H6D4X8/ref=sr_1_5?crid=28AJIKTK8AJ5T&keywords=%22vitamin+d%22+vegan+50%2C000&qid=1702473840&sprefix=vitamin+d+vegan+50%2C000%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-5)  [4](https://www.amazon.com/NatureWise-Vitamin-Supplement-Support-Health/dp/B09K4Q68H9/ref=sr_1_26_sspa?crid=28AJIKTK8AJ5T&keywords=%22vitamin+d%22+vegan+50%2C000&qid=1702473840&rdc=1&sprefix=vitamin+d+vegan+50%2C000%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-26-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&psc=1) make the Vitamin D3 from plants, rather than from oil from sheep wool

   * Note: no animals are harmed in making ANY type of vitamin D

1.  **Might have to modify current drugs/supplements**  typically none: possible exceptions:

   * Reduce <a href="/posts/calcium-hazards-and-bioavailability" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Calcium hazards and bioavailability">Calcium</a> or take a Calcium made from algae, such as  [1](https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Red-Mineral-Algae-Capsules/dp/B001GZWHIQ/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3M9FBJ0J1ESG8&keywords=Red+Mineral+Algae&qid=1702480951&sprefix=red+mineral+algae%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-2) [2](https://www.amazon.com/Capsules-Vegetarian-Supplement-Non-GMO-Carlyle/dp/B09H654TDV/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3M9FBJ0J1ESG8&keywords=Red+Mineral+Algae&qid=1702480951&sprefix=red+mineral+algae%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-3) [3](https://www.amazon.com/Mineral-Vegetarian-Capsules-Piping-Rock/dp/B0B324K9KL/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3M9FBJ0J1ESG8&keywords=Red+Mineral+Algae&qid=1702480951&sprefix=red+mineral+algae%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-6) [4](https://www.amazon.com/Swanson-Aquamin-Sea-Minerals-Capsules/dp/B004Y46MVE/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3M9FBJ0J1ESG8&keywords=Red%2BMineral%2BAlgae&qid=1702480951&sprefix=red%2Bmineral%2Balgae%2Caps%2C166&sr=8-8&th=1)

   * <a href="/posts/chemotherapy-and-vitamin-d-many-studies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Chemotherapy and vitamin D - many studies">Chemotherapy</a> - enhances effects of some chemo drugs, so you MUST check with the doctor before taking Vitamin D

1.  **Have to know enough about Vitamin D to be able to justify supplementation to family/friends**  

   * Taking a single capsule (50,000 IU) [once every 2 weeks](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need) can be hidden from family

1.  **Concerned that others you know are not taking Vitamin D**  

   * Lots of evidence of many others taking Vitamin D, for example, in [Australia](/posts/vitamin-d-testing-and-levels-are-increasing-in-australia-nsw)

1.  **Might forget to take the capsule at a particular time of day** 

   * Can take Vitamin D any time of the day: before, during, or after meals - but not after supper (might keep you awake)

   * However, better response if taken with the largest meal of the day

1.  **Unsure of how much to take** 

   * 4,000 IU or 5,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU twice a month is a great place to start

1.  **Have an adverse reaction to Vitamin D** 

   * <a href="/posts/rare-adverse-reaction-3-in-1000-to-lots-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 6281">Rare adverse reaction (3 in 1,000) to lots of Vitamin D</a> is often due to lack of magnesium

   * Adverse reactions to D are far less common than reactions to gluten, lactose, peanut butter, iron  etc.

   * See also [Getting Vitamin D into your blood and cells](/posts/getting-vitamin-d-into-your-blood-and-cells) for other forms, types of Vitamin D - including Sun and UV lamps

1.  **Unsure if Vitamin D will help, and not want to wait for months to find out** 

   * Take a <a href="/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Loading of vitamin D">loading dose</a> and see results in as little as a week

   * <a href="/posts/treating-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-senior-women-such-as-50000-iu-daily-for-15-days--a-month-review" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Treating Vitamin D deficiency in senior women – such as 50,000 IU daily for 15 days then twice a month – Review April 2019">50,0000 IU daily</a> for a week is a typical loading dose

1.  **Believe that food (still) has the right nutrients needed for health** 

   * Food today vs 100 years ago has 3X less Vitamin D 

1.  **Your country does not (yet) allow sales of capsules containing >1,000 IU of Vitamin D** 

   * Many people buy larger doses over the Internet from other countries

   * Hint - Buy only a few bottles at a time so as to not concern the customs agents about re-sale

1.  **Believe that you can get enough Vitamin D from the sun if outdoors at least 10 minutes daily** 

   * 10 minutes is enough if you want only 400 IUs and are young, white-skinned, lying down, with few clothes on, in the summer, around noon
