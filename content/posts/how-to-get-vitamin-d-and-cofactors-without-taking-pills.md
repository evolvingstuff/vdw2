This is a frequently-asked-question at VitaminDWiki.  

Here are a few answers. &nbsp; &nbsp;(These numbers assume that you want 10,000 IU of vitamin D daily.)

 **1) Sublinqual + Mg liquid** 

Get Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K-2 as a sublingual

Get the next most important cofactor, [Magnesium](/categories/magnesium) as a liquid

Skip the other cofactors unless you are very concerned about your bones.

The sublingual from [Michael's](http://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-D3-5000-IU-Sublingual/dp/B003CWH96G/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1359931115&sr=1-1&keywords=michael%27s+vitamin+d3) has 5,000 IU of vitamin D + 90 micrograms of Vitamin K-2

The sublinquals take about 2 minutes to dissolve, but are extremely easy to chew then melt in your mouth

Sublinguals are the form my wife prefers. She takes 2 per day

There are many suppliers of [Magnesium liquid = Oil or Chloride](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&field-keywords=magnesium+oil)

 **2) Cofactors as liquid** 

<a href="/posts/osteodensity-and-several-others" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">Osteodensity and several others</a> provide many of the cofactors as a single liquid

 **3) Cofactors as a Fizzy powder and add Vitamin D powder** 

The <a href="/posts/fizzy-powder" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">Fizzy powder</a> has K-2 which the Osteodensity lacks and several other nice vitamins and minerals.

 **3a) Add vitamin D from cut open capsules to 2) or 3)**  

<a href="/posts/bio-tech" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 3188">Bio-Tech</a> has the lowest-cost vitamin D in capsules  – which can be cut open (knife, scissors)

Each Bio-Tech capsule provides 50,000 IU, so you would only need to take the powder once every days.

Example: for the Fizzy powder – which lasts for 60 days:

The Fizzy powder already contains 1,000 IU per day/serving

If you want 10,000 IU/day, then you need to add 60 X 9,000 IU = 540,000 IU

Since there are 50,000 IU in each capsule, you would need to cut open 11 capsules

 **3b) Add the vitamin D from bulk to 2) or 3)** 

[Bulk vitamin D](http://purebulk.com/vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-powder-capsules.html#) costs about 1/2 as much (no capsules to fill)

<a href="/posts/click-here" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 120">CLICK HERE</a> for more about the bulk form at VitaminDWiki

Bulk = 100,000 IU per gram.  They sell 100 grams for $23 + shipping

I measured it, and found that 1 level teaspoon weighs 1.6 grams, so has 160,000 IU of vitamin D3

To fortify the Fizzy above for 60 days you would need 540,000 IU = 3.38 teaspoons.

.

 **Reminder: Take with Almonds** 

It appears that Vitamin D is more bio-available if taken with some fats.

The best type of fat is <a href="/posts/monounsaturated-which-is-in-almonds" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1903">monounsaturated, which is in Almonds</a>

I take my vitamin D with a few almonds.

 **Reminder: Not too late at night** 

For some people, like myself, the vitamin D is similar to coffee, in that is acts as a stimulant.

So you might consider taking your vitamin D at least 3 hours before going to sleep.

Various studies (which did ot investigate monosaturated fats) found a 50% increase in vitamin D uptake when taken with the biggest meal of the day

 **You could also use the vitamin D powder to fortify your food** 

[Vitamin D home fortification- don't wait 100 years for your govt](/posts/vitamin-d-home-fortification-dont-wait-100-years-for-your-govt) 

Mix it in something you would be taking over say a month - e.g. sugar, salt, jam, mouth wash, . . . . 

Get vitamin D to the whole family

This is OK provided you do not get more than about 3,000 or 4,000 IU daily per person

More than that and you should, somehow, add some important cofactors to balance the body
