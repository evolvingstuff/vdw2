Objective: Aim of the study was to examine the effects of the vitamin D (Vit-D) treatment and non-treatment on Vit-D-deficient patients without a prior history of myocardial infarction (MI).

Materials and Methods: This is an retrospective, observational, nested case-control study of patients (N=20,025) with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[(25-OH)D]</span> levels (<20 ng/ml) who received care at the Veterans Health Administration from 1999-2018. Patients were divided into three groups: Group A (untreated, levels <20 ng/ml), Group B (treated, levels 21-29 ng/ml), and Group C (treated, levels >30 ng/ml). The risk of MI and all-cause-mortality were compared utilizing propensity score-weighted cox-proportional hazard models.

Results. Among the cohort of 20,025 patients, the risk of MI was significantly lower in Group C, compared to Group B <span>[hazard ratio (HR) 0.65, 95% CI; 0.49-0.85, P=.002]</span> and Group A (HR 0.73, 95% CI; 0.55-0.96), P=.02). There was no difference in the risk of MI between Group B and Group A (HR 1.14, 95% CI; 0.91-1.42, P=.24]. Compared to Group A, both Group B (HR 0.59, 95% CI; 0.54-0.63, P<.001] and Group C ( **HR 0.61** , 95% CI; 0.56-0.67, P<.001] had significantly lower all-cause-mortality. There was no difference in all-cause- mortality between Group B and Group C (HR 0.99, 95% CI; 0.89-1.09, P=.78).

Conclusions. In patients with Vit-D-deficiency and no prior history of MI, treatment to the (25-OH)D level of >20 ng/ml and >30 ng/ml was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause-mortality. The lower risk of MI was observed only in individuals maintaining the (25-OH)D levels >30 ng/ml.
