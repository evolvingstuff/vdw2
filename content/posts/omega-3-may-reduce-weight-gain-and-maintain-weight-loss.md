Strategies to reduce obesity have become public health priorities as the prevalence of obesity has risen in the United States and around the world. While the anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are well known, their antiobesity effects and efficacy against metabolic syndrome, especially in humans, are still under debate. In animal models, evidence consistently suggests a role for n-3 PUFAs in reducing fat mass, particularly in the retroperitoneal and epididymal regions. 

In humans, however, published research suggests that though n-3 PUFAs may not aid weight loss, they  **may attenuate further weight gain**  and could be useful in the diet or as a supplement to  **help maintain weight loss** . Proposed mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs may work to improve body composition and counteract obesity-related metabolic changes include modulating lipid metabolism; regulating adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin; alleviating adipose tissue inflammation; promoting adipogenesis and altering epigenetic mechanisms.

 **Conclusions from PDF** 

The management of obesity has shifted from a narrow focus on BMI to the wider field that includes the complications of obesity, with the goal to reduce obesity-associated comorbidities <sup>[209]</sup>. While n-3 PUFAs have not yet shown consistent benefits in terms of weight loss in humans, improvements in the metabolic profile of obese individuals have been demonstrated. 

Therefore, n-3 PUFAs may be an important adjunct to obesity management along with lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy. 

Further study of the genetic and epigenetic molecular targets related to metabolism, appetite and energetics could aid the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for obesityassociated metabolic disorders.
