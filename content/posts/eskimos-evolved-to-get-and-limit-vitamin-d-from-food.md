#### An interesting line of reasoning by a reader of VitaminDWiki. - April 2010

 **Complete version of this, with hyperlinks, is in an attached file at bottom of this page - April 2010** 

Due to the zenith angle of the sun not enough UVB reaches the ground that far north.  These far northern peoples relied on their ancestral diet for vitamin D.  As you know vitamin D is fat soluble.  That is why it requires 2-3 times the daily D3 supplement for the obese to maintain healthy serum vitamin D, for it gets caught up in their body fat.  In regards to the Inuit and Eskimo their diet of whale, seal, and walrus blubber (vitamin D saturated fat), along with eggs and char (trout) are all rich in vitamin D.  These northern peoples did not rely on the sun for vitamin D, they consumed it.

But how did the Inuit and Eskimo avoid vitamin D toxicity?  The answer comes in two parts; 1) bile acidity, 2) gut gene polymorphisms.

### A high fat diet changes bile acidity making it more acid.  Higher bile acidity flushes vitamin D out of the gut.

Just as people who rely on the sun have gene polymorphisms in their skin pigment based on latitude (blacks at the equator, light skinned blondes in Norway) to regulate serum vitamin D production, the Inuit and Eskimo have a gut gene polymorphism that reduces their ability to absorb vitamin D in the gut.  If you gave a white and an Inuit the same daily supplement of vitamin D3 in winter, the Inuit would have lower serum vitamin D results.

When the Inuit and Eskimos shifted from their ancestral diet to a European diet this occurred;

It is the same reason the Inuit had a worse time with recent H1N1 pandemic, for vitamin D is being tied to the immune system and influenza prevention and better outcomes.  It offers a three punch attack boosting killer T-cells, producing natural antibiotic, and down regulating the cytokine storm which is the killer in influenza.

### Canadian Aboriginal Women Have a Higher Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency than Non-Aboriginal Women Despite Similar Dietary Vitamin D Intakes

3 Human Nutritional Sciences, 4 Faculty of Medicine, and 5 Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, R3T 2N2 MB, Canada and 6 Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, Winnipeg, R3C 0M6 MB, Canada   hope.weiler@mcgill.ca .

Canadian Aboriginal women have high rates of bone fractures, which is possibly due to low dietary intake of minerals or vitamin D. This study was undertaken to estimate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D by designing a culturally appropriate dietary survey instrument and to determine whether disparities exist between Aboriginal and white women. After validation of a FFQ, 183 urban-dwelling and 26 rural-dwelling Aboriginal women and 146 urban white women completed the validated FFQ and had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> measured. Urban Aboriginal women had lower (P = 0.0004) intakes of total dietary calcium than urban white women; there was no difference in rural Aboriginal women. Only a minority of all women met the adequate intake (AI) for calcium intake. Ethnicity did not affect total vitamin D intake; however, rural Aboriginal women consumed all of their dietary vitamin D from food sources, which was more (P < 0.03) than both urban Aboriginal and white women. Rural and urban Aboriginal women had lower (P < 0.0004) serum 25(OH)D than urban white women. We found that 32% of rural Aboriginal, 30.4% of urban Aboriginal, and 18.6% of urban white women were vitamin D deficient, with serum 25(OH)D concentrations <37.5 nmol/L. The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Aboriginal women, combined with lower dietary intake of calcium, especially in older women, likely contributes to the higher incidence of fracture in this population.

The more worrisome link is how serum vitamin D changes in premature, low birth weight infants.  

Due to advances in medicine 12% of all surviving births are premature, low birth weight infants.  

Of these 50% suffer some degree of Choleotasis (changes bile) which seems to create vitamin D absorption issues in the gut and this segment of the population sees this life long result;

### Adults Born With Very Low Birth Weight at Risk for Osteoporosis

(Ivanhoe Newswire) -- In a new study, Petteri Hovi and colleagues from the National Institute for Health and Welfare Helsinki,  **Finland**  evaluated skeletal health in 144 adults, ages ranging from 18 to 27 years, who were born preterm with very low birth weight. They show that as adults these individuals have significantly lower bone mineral density than do their term-born peers and suggest that this finding translates into increased risk for osteoporosis in adulthood for these individuals.

The most interesting aspect of serum vitamin D is how it affects cultural behavior.  This is due to the relationship between serum vitamin D and serotonin production.  Serotonin is tied to memory, learning, libido, mood, and impulse control along with aggression regulation.

Once you understand serotonin and its function, as well as how serotonin levels are tied to serum vitamin D levels look at how it has affected cultures.  First look at the Eskimo that will share a spouse sexually with no aggression, and then look at the Middle East where the body is hidden from the sun for theological reasons (down regulate libido) and the impulse control, aggression issues found there.  Then look towards Norway and cultural norms regarding public nudity.  Serum vitamin D drives cultural behavior.

You can even plot the major wars and there onset as related to the suns solar variation in UVB production.  When the sun is less active it produces less UVB.  When did the friction that resulted in WWI and WWII build to a boiling point, during solar minima;

You can slot in any number of world conflicts as related to lower available UVB affecting serum vitamin D, affecting serotonin production, as related to aggression and impulse control (World Trade Center).  All had a depleted UVB precursor.

I do not know if you are a religious person but it certainly amplifies the story of Adam and Eve and being ejected from Eden after hiding their bodies from God’s light.

You have an excellent resource page on vitamin D, but I believe the implications of serum vitamin D go far beyond health.  It reaches into culture and behavior.

Simply look at Seasonal Affective Disorder for the short term seasonal effects of vitamin D deficiency regarding mood and behavior and then expand that to cultural trends and their relationship to the sun.
