#### Epstein-Barr virus, vitamin D and the immune response: connections with consequences for multiple sclerosis - Dec 2024

Front. Immunol., Volume 15 - 2024 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1503808

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with no definitive trigger. However, epidemiological studies indicate that environmental factors, such as infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and low vitamin D (Vit D) levels in genetically predisposed individuals, are important risk factors. One leading proposal is that EBV triggers MS via mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, where activated autoreactive B and T lymphocytes mistakenly target self-antigens. In line with other risk factors, low serum Vit D level, genetic polymorphism of Vit D receptor, and higher incidence of MS in countries in the northern hemisphere, suggest that Vit D also plays a role in MS pathology. Vitamin D, known for its neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects, helps maintain a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune cells. 

Studies and ongoing clinical trials indicate that hypovitaminosis D is associated with an increased risk of MS, and Vit D supplement can help to reduce the disease severity. Moreover, hypovitaminosis D has also been associated with a dysregulated immune system and an increased risk of developing MS. 

This review explores how these three well-recognized risk factors - 

* EBV infection, 

* hypovitaminosis D, and 

* dysregulated immune system 

- interact in the pathogenesis of MS. Understanding these interactions and their consequences could provide new insights into novel therapeutic approaches for treating this devastating disease.

#### Epstein-Barr virus infection in the development of neurological disorders - 2020

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human herpesvirus that contributes to the etiology of diverse human cancers and auto-immune diseases. EBV establishes a relatively benign, long-term latent infection  **in over 90 percent of the adult population** . Yet, it also increases risk for certain cancers and auto-immune disorders depending on complex viral, host, and environmental factors that are only partly understood. EBV latent infection is found predominantly in  **memory B cells** , but the natural infection cycle and pathological aberrations enable EBV to infect numerous other cell types, including

oral, nasopharyngeal, and gastric epithelia, B-, T-, and NK-lymphoid cells, myocytes, adipocytes, astrocytes, and neurons.

EBV infected cells, free virus, and gene products can also be found in the CNS. In addition to the direct effects of EBV on infected cells and tissue, the effect of chronic EBV infection on the immune system is also thought to contribute to pathogenesis, especially auto-immune disease. Here, we review properties of EBV infection that may shed light on its potential pathogenic role in neurological disorders.

#### Epstein-Barr Virus and Neurological Diseases - Jan 2022

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a double-stranded DNA virus that is ubiquitous in 90–95% of the population as a gamma herpesvirus. It exists in two main states, latent infection and lytic replication, each encoding viral proteins with different functions. Human B-lymphocytes and epithelial cells are EBV-susceptible host cells. EBV latently infects B cells and nasopharyngeal epithelial cells throughout life in most immunologically active individuals. EBV-infected cells, free viruses, their gene products, and abnormally elevated EBV titers are observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. Studies have shown that EBV can infect neurons directly or indirectly via infected B-lymphocytes, induce neuroinflammation and demyelination, promote the proliferation, degeneration, and necrosis of glial cells, promote proliferative disorders of B- and T-lymphocytes, and contribute to the occurrence and development of nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, acute cerebellar ataxia, meningitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and brain tumors. However, the specific underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this paper, we review the mechanisms underlying the role of EBV in the development of central nervous system diseases, which could bebeneficial in providing new research ideas and potential clinical therapeutic targets for neurological diseases.

#### The Virus That Causes Mono Does a Lot More Than That - March 2022

 **[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/epstein-barr-virus-mono-cancer-research/623881/?utm_source=feed)** 

autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and multiple sclerosis

cancers, chronic fatigue.

* "The recent study from Harvard’s Ascherio got around this by looking at a massive archive of serum samples taken from people over 20 years. The collection came from the Department of Defense, which stores serum from routine tests for HIV. Among the 10 million adults with samples in the repository, researchers were able to find enough people who were initially negative for EBV but then contracted it during the 20-year period. And those who did get the virus were 32 times as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as those who did not. A second study from Stanford adds a possible causation to this correlation: Some multiple-sclerosis patients have antibodies that bind both an EBV protein and a protein in the brain, which is erroneously targeted by the immune system in multiple sclerosis. This kind of cross-reaction has long been suspected in MS but only now identified. “It’s just like a great volcano of information,” says Rickinson about the recent studies. As with EBV-associated cancers, though, only a tiny sliver of people infected with the virus end up developing multiple sclerosis, so some other trigger or triggers must also be in play. We’re only at the beginning of understanding this process."

* "And in the 1980s, doctors noticing the similarity had begun diagnosing chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome in patients whose mono-like symptoms of fatigue and sore throat did not go away for months. Eventually, however, experts took Epstein-Barr out of the name and gave it the more general term of chronic fatigue syndrome, because EBV does not seem to be the sole cause of such symptoms."
