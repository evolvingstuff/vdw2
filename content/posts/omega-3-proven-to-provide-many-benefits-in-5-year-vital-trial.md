#### Review of the study by the Washington Post - April 2019

 **[Don’t throw away your vitamin D supplements yet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/dont-throw-away-your-vitamin-d-supplements-yet/2019/04/01/56c0961c-4c13-11e9-b79a-961983b7e0cd_story.html?utm_term=.92c391a69ba1)** 

"The VITAL study was poorly designed and the results have not been adequately explained in the abstract and in the press coverage. The vitamin D status of many participants was above average and the dose (2000 IU/d vitamin D3) was too low to find beneficial results for cancer incidence for the entire group. However, for those with BMI <25 kg/m2, there was a 24% reduction in all-cancer incidence. For blacks, who have lower vitamin D status than whites, there was a 23% reduction in all-cancer incidence. When the first 1-2 years of the study are omitted, there was a 21 and 25% reduction in all-cancer mortality rate. Thus, this study adds to the literature that UVB exposure and vitamin D reduce the risk of cancer incidence and mortality. Had the authors designed and analyzed the results based on achieved vitamin D status, the results would have been much stronger. One wonders whether the reporting of the results has buried the positive findings in order to benefit our disease-treatment system rather than to reduce the burden of unnecessary disease."
