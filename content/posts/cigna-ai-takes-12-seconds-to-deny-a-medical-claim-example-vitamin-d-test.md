 **[Cigna accused of using AI, not doctors, to deny claims: Lawsuit](https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/264561/practice-management/cigna-accused-using-ai-not-doctors-deny?ecd=WNL_EVE_230807_mdedge)  MDedge** 

* "A new lawsuit alleges that Cigna uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to inappropriately deny “hundreds or thousands” of claims at a time, bypassing legal requirements to complete individual claim reviews and forcing providers to bill patients in full."

* "According to the complaint, Cigna denied the plaintiffs medically necessary tests, including blood work to screen for  **vitamin D deficiency**  and ultrasounds for patients suspected of having ovarian cancer. The plaintiffs’ attempts to appeal were unfruitful, and they were forced to pay out of pocket."

* "One physician who worked for Cigna told the nonprofit that he and other company doctors essentially rubber-stamped the denials in batches, which took “all of 10 seconds to do 50 at a time.”"
