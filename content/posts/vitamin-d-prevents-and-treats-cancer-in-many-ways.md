Background: The epidemiological relationship between vitamin D levels and cancer has been thoroughly investigated. Published data from large studies appear to corroborate a significant relationship between higher serum vitamin D concentrations and improved survival. Mechanistic reviews on commonly-studied cancers – including breast cancer, colon cancer and melanoma – focus predominantly on data from older studies. In outlining avenues for future research, we believe there is utility in summarizing novel findings introduced to the literature. 

Materials and Methods: In this narrative review, we used MEDLINE, PUBMED and Cochrane databases to identify mechanistic studies published from January 1, 2015 onwards exploring this topic. 

Results: Twenty-five mechanistic studies were included in this review. It was found that vitamin D plays a critical role in both 

*  **direct** 

   * tumor gene expression, proliferation, invasiveness, sensitivity to chemotherapy etc. and 

*  **indirect** 

   * effects on the tumor microenvironment and immunomodulation) 

tumor suppression mechanisms. 

Conclusion: These newly-identified pathways warrant further research, with the hopes that we may understand how and when vitamin D supplementation can be integrated into precision medicine therapeutics for cancers of the breast, colon and skin. Cancer care providers should consider recommendations to screen for vitamin D deficiency in this population.
