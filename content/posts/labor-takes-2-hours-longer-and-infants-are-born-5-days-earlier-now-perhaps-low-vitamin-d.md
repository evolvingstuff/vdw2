### [NIH study finds women spend longer in labor now than 50 years ago](http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2012/nichd-02.htm) April 2012

* first stage of labor had increased by 

> 2.6 hours for first-time mothers. 

> 2.0 hours if previously given birth

* epidural injections were used in more than half of recent deliveries, compared with 4 percent of deliveries in the 1960s. The study authors noted that epidural anesthesia is known to increase delivery time, but said it doesnâ€™t account for all of the increase.

* Cesarean delivery was 4X more often (12 % vs. 3 %).

* Infants born  5 days earlier

* Compared birth data of 1959-1966 with 2002 - 2008.
