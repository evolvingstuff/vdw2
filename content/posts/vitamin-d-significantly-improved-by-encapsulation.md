Vitamin D is a lipophilic vitamin essential for various bodily functions, including skeletal health and phosphorus-calcium metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency may be responsible for causing illnesses like cancers, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, immunological disorders, and neurological disorders. Virgin form vitamin D has poor shelf-life, poor water solubility, and susceptibility to various stresses (of light, pH, temperature, etc.), so its encapsulation can overcome these issues. 

Encapsulation by various techniques improves its bioavailability and controlled release by utilizing different wall materials. In the present review, an in-depth and state of the art review is carried out on the recent vitamin D encapsulation characterizations, recent wall materials, and its fortification in various foods and pharmaceutical formulations. The study is of immense importance as better bioavailability and shelf life of vitamin D are the need of the hour, which in turn may save human lives and ease the burden on our exchequer.

#### Encapsulated vitamin D is indeed much better, and has been sold since before 2010
