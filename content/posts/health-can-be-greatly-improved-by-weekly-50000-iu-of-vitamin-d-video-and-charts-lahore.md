### (17) Vitamin D helps you lose weight when you stress your body

 **After your vitamin D level has plateaued  
You will experience fat/weight loss if you stress your body by:  
1) Exercise  
2) Calorie restrictive diet  
3) Intermitant fasting  
 4) Water-only fasting** 

 **See [Obese lost more weight on diet if added 50,000 IU of vitamin D weekly – many RCTs](/posts/obese-lost-more-weight-on-diet-if-added-50000-iu-of-vitamin-d-weekly-many-rcts)

### (18) Why Vitamin D weekly is better than daily

More compliance (6X fewer opportunities to forget)

&nbsp;

Weekly high concentration gets D into cells much faster 

&nbsp; &nbsp; True for most chemistries

&nbsp; &nbsp; High gradients overcome Vitamin D Receptor limitations

&nbsp;

44 percent of successful RCTs in VitaminDWiki had used non-daily dosing 

&nbsp;

Note Humans and animals have evolved to go for days with many nutrients

### (19) Doctors often reluctant to prescribe Vitamin D because:

* Can have side affects If not adjust cofactors with high dose

* Would require ignoring the position of the medical profession on supplements.

* Risk being sued if exceed standard of care

* Experts do not agree on how much is needed

* Doctors are rarely been trained in nutrition

* Medical training has an emphasis on treatment, not prevention

* Doctors have tried prescribing small vitamin D doses recommended by govts., but with minimal success

* Doctors often can only prescribe D2 anyway - become used to its not working

* Doctors have too little time to read outside of their specialty

* No profit for Big Pharma, nor hospitals, so doctors not rewarded

* The Vitamin D dose needed often varies by 4X between individuals for many health problems

* Doctors are told to not prescribe more than 4,000 IU – so miss out on many of the benefits

* Doctors are used to monotherapy, single pill, of a single size for everyone
