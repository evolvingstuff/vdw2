 **Short article with this great title starts with** 

A few years, ago I noticed I was constantly tired. As you know, each day I am either in the operating room or my practice at a very early hour. But I noticed that no matter what I did, eating right or exercising often, nothing improved the tired feeling I had. Finally I checked my Vitamin D level and it turned out it was low. It was about 25; the normal value should be over 30. Ideal levels for men and women should be in the 40-50 range.

I began taking 2000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day - which is the most active form. D3 is the best form of Vitamin D to take in terms of supplements. Obviously, we'd all love to get our Vitamin D through sun exposure but as winter approached, we know that's not always possible.

Great title, nice article.
