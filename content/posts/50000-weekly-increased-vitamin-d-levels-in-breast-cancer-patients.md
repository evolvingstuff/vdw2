Vitamin D deficiency in the patients treated for breast cancer is associated with numerous adverse effects (bone loss, arthralgia, and falls). 

The first aim of this study was to assess vitamin D status, determined by 25-OH vitamin D levels, among women diagnosed with breast cancer according to demographic/clinical variables and bone mineral density (BMD). 

The second aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of daily low-dose and weekly high-dose vitamin D supplementation on 25-OH vitamin D levels. 

This retrospective study included 224 women diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer who received treatment at the James P. Wilmot Cancer Center at the University of Rochester Medical Center. 

Total 25-OH vitamin D levels (D(2) + D(3)) were determined at baseline for all participants. 

Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a 25-OH vitamin D level < 20 ng/ml, insufficiency as 20-31 ng/ml, and sufficiency as ?32 ng/ml. 

BMD was assessed during the period between 3 months before and 6 months following the baseline vitamin D assessment. 

Based on the participants' baseline levels, they received either  

* no supplementation, 

* low-dose supplementation ( **1,000 IU/day** ), or 

* high-dose supplementation ( **?50,000 IU/week** ), 

and 25-OH vitamin D was reassessed in the following 8-16 weeks. 

Approximately 66.5% had deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels at baseline. 

Deficiency/insufficiency was more common among non-Caucasians, women with later-stage disease, and those who had previously received radiation therapy (P < 0.05). 

Breast cancer patients with deficient/insufficient 25-OH vitamin D levels had significantly lower lumbar BMD (P = 0.03). 

Compared to the no-supplementation group,  **weekly high-dose supplementation significantly increased 25-OH vitamin D levels** , while daily low-dose supplementation did not significantly increase levels. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were common among women with breast cancer and associated with reduced BMD in the spine. 

Clinicians should carefully consider vitamin D supplementation regimens when treating vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in breast cancer patients.

#### The Effect of Various Vitamin D Supplementation Regimens in Breast Cancer Patients - 2014 (same authors)

Ann Surg Oncol. 2012 Aug; 19(8): 2590–2599.  [doi: 10.1245/s10434-012-2297-3](https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-012-2297-3)

Purpose

Vitamin D deficiency in patients treated for breast cancer is associated with numerous adverse effects (bone loss, arthralgia, and falls). The first aim of this study was to assess vitamin D status, determined by 25-OH vitamin D levels, among women diagnosed with breast cancer according to demographic/clinical variables and bone mineral density (BMD). The second aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of daily low-dose and weekly high-dose vitamin D supplementation on 25-OH vitamin D levels.

Methods

This retrospective study included 224 women diagnosed with Stage 0-III breast cancer who received treatment at the James P. Wilmot Cancer Center at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Total 25-OH vitamin D levels (D2 + D3) were determined at baseline for all participants. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a 25-OH vitamin D level < 20 ng/mL, insufficiency as 20-31 ng/mL, and sufficiency as ≥ 32 ng/mL. BMD was assessed during the period between 3 months prior to and 6 months following the baseline vitamin D assessment. Based on the participants’ baseline levels, they received either no supplementation, low-dose supplementation (1,000 IU/day), or high-dose supplementation (≥ 50,000 IU/week), and 25-OH vitamin D was reassessed in the following 8-16 weeks.

Results

Approx 66.5% had deficient/insufficient vitamin D levels at baseline. Deficiency/insufficiency was more common among non-Caucasians, women with later-stage disease, and those who had previously received radiation therapy (p<0.05). Breast cancer patients with deficient/insufficient 25-OH vitamin D levels had significantly lower lumbar BMD (p=0.03). Compared to the no supplementation group, weekly high-dose supplementation significantly increased 25-OH vitamin D levels, while daily low-dose supplementation did not significantly increase levels.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were common among women with breast cancer and associated with reduced BMD in the spine. Clinicians should carefully consider vitamin D supplementation regimens when treating vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in breast cancer patients.
