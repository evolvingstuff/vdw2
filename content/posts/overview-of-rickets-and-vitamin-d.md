### [Rickets or abuse? A histologic comparison of rickets and child abuse-related fractures](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12024-014-9639-3%20)

Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology, January 2015, $40 for PDF

 **Results** 

In the case of rickets, there was marked architectural disorganization of endochondral ossification at the costochondral junctions and growth plates of long bones. The child abuse-related fractures showed osteochondral callus at different stages of healing, either centered on a discrete fracture line or at metaphyses (e.g. classical metaphyseal lesions). In many instances, the healing fractures disrupted the line of endochondral ossification. In none of the child abuse-related fractures was there any similarity to the histologic appearance of rickets.

 **Conclusion** 

The maturation disturbance in the growth plate that occurs in rickets is a distinctive entity that cannot be confused histologically with healing fractures, including the classical metaphyseal lesion.

#### The RESISTANCE of Vitamin D Resistent Rickets may be due to Vitamin D RECEPTOR - March 2019

 **Detecting reasons for recurrent deformity in treatment of patients with vitamin D-resistant rickets using diagnostic imaging** 

J Orthop. 2019 Mar 22;16(4):325-328. [doi: 10.1016/j.jor.2019.02.033.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2019.02.033.) eCollection 2019 Jul-Aug.

PURPOSE: To assess age related manifestations of the femur and tibia in patients with vitamin D-resistant rickets  **(VDR)**  and explore causes for recurrent deformity using imaging modalities.

METHODS: Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual energy X-ray densitometry (DEXA) were used to assess conditions of long bones of lower limbs in patients with vitamin D-resistant rickets aged from 4 years to 30 years preoperatively and after limb lengthening.

RESULTS:

Age related MRI findings showed specific structure of the femur and tibia in patients with  **(VDR)**  preoperatively and after operative treatment. Abundant irregular osteoid formed in femoral and tibial physes was shown to reveal complicated nature of bone deformity causing recurrence in patients with  **(VDR)**  at childhood. CT findings allowed us to detect early cortical injury, measure its length with forming Looser's zones, examine significant differences in density measurements of Looser's zones preoperatively and after deformity correction using transosseous osteosynthesis.

CONCLUSION:

Recurrent deformity can develop in patients with  **(VDR)**  due to progression of the disease, irregular osteoid deposited in the medial and lateral metaepiphysis, osteoid area measuring over 50% of epiphyseal cross section, insufficient regenerate mineralization, and formation of Looser's zones.
