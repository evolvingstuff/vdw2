Population-based data relating to vitamin D status of children in Northeast Asia are lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence and determinants of vitamin D deficiency in 9595 schoolchildren aged 6–13 years in Ulaanbaatar (UB), the capital city of Mongolia. Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were collected by questionnaire, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay, standardized and categorized as deficient (25<span>[OH]</span>D <10 ng/mL) or not. Odds ratios for associations between independent variables and risk of vitamin D deficiency were calculated using multivariate analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. The prevalence of vitamins D deficiency was 40.6% (95% CI 39.7% to 41.6%). It was independently associated with female gender (adjusted odds ratio <span>[aOR]</span> for girls vs. boys 1.23, 95% CI 1.11–1.35), month of sampling (aORs for December–February vs. June–November 5.28 <span>[4.53–6.15]</span>, March–May vs. June–November 14.85 <span>[12.46–17.74]</span>), lower levels of parental education (P for trend <0.001), lower frequency of egg consumption (P for trend <0.001), active tuberculosis (aOR 1.40 <span>[1.03–1.94]</span>), household smoking (aOR 1.13 <span>[1.02 to1.25]</span>), and shorter time outdoors (P for trend <0.001). We report a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Mongolian schoolchildren, which requires addressing as a public health priority.
