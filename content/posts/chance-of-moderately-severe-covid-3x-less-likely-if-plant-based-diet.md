Background Several studies have hypothesised that dietary habits may play an important role in COVID-19 infection, severity of symptoms, and duration of illness. However, no previous studies have investigated the association between dietary patterns and COVID-19.

Methods  **Healthcare workers (HCWs) from six countries**  (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA) with substantial exposure to COVID-19 patients completed a web-based survey from  **17 July to 25 September 2020** . Participants provided information on demographic characteristics, dietary information, and COVID-19 outcomes. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between self-reported diets and COVID-19 infection, severity, and duration.

Results There were  **568 COVID-19 cases**  and 2316 controls. 

Among the 568 cases, 

* 138 individuals had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity whereas 

* 430 individuals had very mild to mild COVID-19 severity. 

After adjusting for important confounders, participants who reported following  **‘plant-based diets’** and ‘plant-based diets or pescatarian diets’ had 73% ( **OR 0.27** , 95% CI 0.10 to 0.81) and 59% (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99) lower odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity, respectively, compared with participants who did not follow these diets. 

Compared with participants who reported following ‘plant-based diets’, those who reported following  **‘low carbohydrate, high protein diets’**  had greater odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 ( **OR 3.86** , 95% CI 1.13 to 13.24). No association was observed between self-reported diets and COVID-19 infection or duration.

Conclusion In six countries, plant-based diets or pescatarian diets were associated with lower odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. These dietary patterns may be considered for protection against severe COVID-19.
