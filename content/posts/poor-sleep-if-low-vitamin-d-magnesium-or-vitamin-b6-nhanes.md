OBJECTIVES: To understand the association between micro and macronutrient intake and sleep variables from the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES, 2005-2016).

METHODS:

Data analysis was performed using SAS 9.4; regression analysis was used to assess the relationship (p < 0.05) of nutrient intake with sleep variables. All nutrients were individual usual intakes determined using the National Cancer Institute method from food plus supplements; covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, poverty income ration, current smoking status and physical activity level. Individuals 16+ years of age were included in the analysis; pregnant or lactating females and those with unreliable dietary recalls were excluded in the analysis. Seven (7) Sleep variables included in the analysis were short sleep hours (<7 hrs of sleep) and trouble sleeping (NHANES 2005-2016), sleep disorder (NHANES, 2005-2014) and poor sleep quality, insomnia, sleep latency, and use of sleeping pills >5 times in the last month (NHANES 2005-2008).

RESULTS:

In adults (males and females) 19+ years, 

* 32.7% experienced short sleep; 

* 47.3% poor sleep quality; 

* 8.94% a sleep disorder; 

* 37.9% sleep latency; 

* 9.30% used sleeping pills; 

* 15.1% exhibited insomnia; and 

* 27.7% experienced sleep trouble. 

Within this population,  **short sleep**  was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the greatest number of nutrients; showing an inverse association with 

* magnesium, 

* niacin, 

*  **<span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>** , 

* calcium, and 

* dietary fiber intake. 

Across all  **seven sleep variables** , however, 

* magnesium, 

* niacin and 

*  **<span style="color:#00F;">vitamin D</span>** 

demonstrated significant (p < 0.05) inverse association within this population. 

Inverse associations were also found for 

* dietary fiber intake and short sleep and sleep disorder; 

* phosphorus intake and poor sleep quality, 

* sleep latency and sleep pill use; and 

* vitamin K intake and poor sleep quality, sleep disorder, sleep latency and sleep pill use in the gender combined adults 19+ years. 

Within this population however, there were direct associations for the intakes of protein and vitamin B6 and short sleep, sleep disorder and sleep trouble; for the intakes of sodium and vitamin A and poor sleep quality, sleep latency and sleep pill use; for the intake of vitamin B12 and poor ADL and insomnia; and for the intake of zinc and sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep pill use, poor ADL and insomnia. 

Among  **female adults**  19+ years,  **dietary fiber**  was the only nutrient that showed an inverse association with  **all seven sleep variables** .

CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance of micro and macronutrient intake on numerous sleep variables.
