#### Rethinking corticosteroids use in oncology - March 2025

Front Pharmacol. 2025 Mar 26:16:1551111. [doi: 10.3389/fphar.2025.1551111](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2025.1551111)

Corticosteroids (CSs), widely used in oncology for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, help manage cancer-related symptoms and side effects. However, their long-term use may negatively affect patient survival and exacerbate tumor progression. 

* Elevated glucose and glutamine metabolism, 

* disruption of vitamin D levels, and 

* alterations in the microbiome 

are some of the key factors contributing to these adverse outcomes. 

Approaches such as ketogenic diets, fasting, sartans, and vitamin D supplementation have shown promise in providing similar benefits to CSs while mitigating the risks associated with the mechanisms identified as contributing to tumor progression. This perspective underscores the necessity for a reevaluation of CSs use in cancer care and advocates for further research into safer, more effective therapeutic strategies.
