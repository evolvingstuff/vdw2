#### [Oral Contraceptives Reduce Risk for Ovarian and Endometrial Cancers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/well/live/oral-contraceptives-reduce-risk-for-ovarian-and-endometrial-cancers.html) New York Times Jan 2018

* “ . . the effect is especially evident in smokers, the obese and those who exercise infrequently. . 

> These people are at high risk of being Vitamin D deficient

* “… those who had used them for 10 years or more had a 34 percent reduced risk for endometrial cancer…”

* “Contraceptive use  **did not**  seem to affect the risk for postmenopausal colorectal or breast cancer.”

 **Results (from the JAMA abstract)**  &nbsp; &nbsp;doi:10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.4942

The analytic population was aged 50 to 71 years (median, 62 years) at enrollment and largely white (91%) and postmenopausal (96%). For 

* ovarian cancer, OC use–associated risk reductions strengthened with duration of use (long-term OC use <span>[≥10 years]</span> HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.76; P < .001 for trend) and were similar across modifiable lifestyle factors. 

* Risk reductions for endometrial cancer strengthened with duration of use (long-term OC use HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56-0.78; P < .001 for trend); 

* the most pronounced reductions were among long-term OC users who were 

   * smokers (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25-0.88), had 

   * obese BMIs (0.36; 95% CI, 0.25-0.52), and who 

   * exercised rarely (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29-0.56). 

* Associations between OC use and breast and colorectal cancers were predominantly null.

 **Note by VitaminDWikik – breast and colorectal cancers usually do not start until years after contraceptives are stopped**
