Participants included infants born to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks who participated in the MAGENTA (Magnesium Sulphate at 30 to 34 Weeks’ Gestational Age) trial and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. Ineligibility criteria included illness precluding MRI, congenital or genetic disorders likely to affect brain structure, and living more than 1 hour from the MRI center. One hundred and fourteen of 159 eligible infants were excluded due to incomplete or motion-corrupted MRI. Recruitment occurred between October 22, 2014, and October 25, 2017. Participants were followed up to 2 years of age. Analysis was performed from February 1, 2021, to February 27, 2024. Observers were blind to patient groupings during data collection and processing.</p><p>Exposures Women received <strong>4 g of MgSO4</strong> or isotonic sodium chloride solution given intravenously over 30 minutes.</p><p>Main Outcomes and Measures Prior to data collection, it was hypothesized that infants who were exposed to MgSO4 would show enhanced functional connectivity compared with infants who were not exposed.</p><p>Results A total of 45 infants were included in the analysis: 24 receiving MgSO4 treatment and 21 receiving placebo; 23 (51.1%) were female and 22 (48.9%) were male; and the median gestational age at scan was 40.0 (IQR, 39.1-41.1) weeks. Treatment with MgSO4 was associated with greater voxelwise functional connectivity in the temporal and occipital lobes and deep gray matter structures and with significantly greater clustering coefficients (Hedge g, 0.47 <span>[95% CI, −0.13 to 1.07]</span>), transitivity (Hedge g, 0.51 <span>[95% CI, −0.10 to 1.11]</span>), local efficiency (Hedge g, 0.40 <span>[95% CI, −0.20 to 0.99]</span>), and global efficiency (Hedge g, 0.31 <span>[95% CI, −0.29 to 0.90]</span>), representing enhanced functional segregation and integration.</p><p>Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, infants exposed to MgSO4 had greater voxelwise functional connectivity and functional segregation, consistent with increased brain maturation. Enhanced functional connectivity is a possible mechanism by which MgSO4 protects against cerebral palsy and death.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/prenatal-magnesium-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=brain-development-completed-before-the-magnesium-was-given-in-this-study>Brain development completed before the Magnesium was given in this study</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/fetus-development.jpg alt=image width=700><p>Details at <a href=/posts/ensure-a-healthy-pregnancy-and-baby-take-vitamin-d-before-conception style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby - take Vitamin D before conception">Ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby - take Vitamin D before conception</a></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382323"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382323",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382323"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382323"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382323"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382323"></script></body></html>
