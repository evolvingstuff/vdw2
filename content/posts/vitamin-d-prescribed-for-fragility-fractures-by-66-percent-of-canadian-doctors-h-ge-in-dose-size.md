Objectives: We conducted a survey to explore practice patterns regarding the assessment of hypovitaminosis D and the prescription of vitamin D in acute fracture patients. Our secondary objective was to determine if practice patterns differed between fragility and non-fragility fracture patients.

Design: Cross-sectional survey.

Setting: All surveys were completed using SurveyMonkey(R).

Patients/Participants: We surveyed surgeon members of the Canadian Orthopaedic Association and the Orthopaedic Trauma Association.

Intervention: Survey.

Main Outcome Measurements: The proportion of surgeons who routinely prescribe vitamin D to fracture patients.

Results: 397 surveys were completed. 65.8% of surgeons indicated that they routinely prescribe vitamin D to fragility fracture patients and 25.7% routinely prescribe vitamin D non-fragility fracture patients. We identified considerable variability in dosing regimens as  **45 different dosing regimens**  were prescribed in fragility fracture patients and 29 in non-fragility fracture patients. They ranged from  **daily doses of 400 IU to loading doses of 600,000 IU** . 

The most frequently prescribed doses were 

* 1,000 IU daily (14.6%), 

* 2,000 IU daily (13.4%), and 

* 50,000 IU weekly (8.7%). 

Respondents indicated that they heavily relied upon clinical experience to guide their decisions to prescribe vitamin D to fracture patients.

Conclusions: The results of this survey demonstrate  **multiple areas of uncertainty and a lack of consensus in the prescription of vitamin D to fracture patients** . Fragility patients frequently receive vitamin D supplementation, whereas, the majority of surgeons do not prescribe vitamin D to young fracture patients. High-quality clinical research is needed to determine if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial to fracture patients.
