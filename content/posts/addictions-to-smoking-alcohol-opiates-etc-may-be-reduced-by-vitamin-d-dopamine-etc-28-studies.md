#### Potential roles for vitamin D in preventing and treating impulse control disorders, behavioral addictions, and substance use disorders: a scoping review

Addiction Neuroscience https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addicn.2024.100190

Vitamin D deficiency is a problem of endemic proportions. Vitamin D is a major regulator of dopaminergic and serotonergic circuits, pathways implicated in addictive disorders. This scoping review (OSF registered as 67yhb) examines preclinical and clinical studies exploring relationships between vitamin D in impulse control disorders, behavioral addictions, and substance use disorders. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. We extracted and summarized quantitative and qualitative data through a narrative synthesis and assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and SYRCLE (Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation) criteria. Of 5,442 initial records identified, 28 preclinical and clinical studies were included. For most conditions, we found a negative relationship between vitamin D levels and symptom presence and/or severity. While data suggest a potential beneficial effect of vitamin D on preventing or treating these conditions, there were significant limitations identified by the JBI and SYRCLE assessments. Future studies should include impulse control disorders and other under-explored conditions, address heterogeneity regarding forms, doses, and duration of exposures to vitamin D, and explore vitamin D's potential therapeutic mechanisms.
