#### The association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature infants one month after birth.

Methods: Preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from 2017 to 2022 were divided into ROP and non-ROP groups based on ROP occurrence any stage. Serum 25(OH)D levels and clinical data were compared between the two groups at 1 month after birth, and the relationship between vitamin D levels and ROP was analyzed.

Results: Among the 217 premature infants included, 55 (25.35%) were in the ROP group, and 162 (74.65%) were in the non-ROP group. The ROP group had lower gestational age and birth weight, longer invasive ventilation (IV), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and oxygen therapy times compared to the non-ROP group. 

* Apgar scores, cesarean delivery, and antenatal steroids ratios were lower in the ROP group, while 

* sepsis and pulmonary surfactant utilization ratios were higher (all p < 0.05). 

Significant differences in serum 25-(OH)D levels were observed among children in the 

* non-ROP group (14.20 ± 5.07 ng/ml), 

* ROP treated group (7.891 ± 1.878 ng/ml), and 

* untreated group (12.168 ± 4.354 ng/ml) (p < 0.001). 

Multivariate regression analysis identified antenatal steroids as protective factors and lower birth weight, serum 25-(OH)D levels, long-term invasive mechanical ventilation, and sepsis as independent risk factors for ROP in premature infants.

Conclusion: Vitamin D, lower birth weight, long-term invasive mechanical ventilation, and sepsis were associated with incidence of ROP in preterm infants. Vitamin D was associated with the severity of ROP, emphasizing the importance of prudent vitamin D supplementation and regular monitoring of serum 25-(OH)D levels.

#### What % of extreme pre-mature births have ROP - asked [Perplexity AI Aug 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-retinopathy-of-prematu-v.C.5o8SRsOCiR2vUz3Wbw)

According to the search results, the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is high in extremely premature infants, particularly those born before 28 weeks gestation or weighing less than 1000 grams at birth:

* In infants with birth weight ≤1000 g (extremely low birth weight, ELBW), the  **incidence of any stage ROP was 81.1%**  and the incidence of ROP requiring treatment was 23.9%.

* In infants born at ≤25 weeks gestation (extremely low gestational age, ELGA), the  **incidence of any stage ROP was 92.9%**  and the incidence of ROP requiring treatment was 64.3%.

* More than **95%**  of infants with birth weight ≤900 g and gestational age ≤24 weeks developed ROP.

* The incidence of any ROP was significantly higher in infants born at <28 weeks in 2015-2019 compared to 2010-2014 (74.3% vs 51.7%).

* In the CRYO-ROP study, ROP was noted in 82% of infants weighing <1000 g at birth.

So in summary, the vast majority (>80%) of extremely premature infants with birth weight ≤1000 g or gestational age <28 weeks develop some degree of ROP, with rates exceeding 90% in the most immature infants. Severe ROP requiring treatment occurs in about 20-65% of these extremely premature babies.
