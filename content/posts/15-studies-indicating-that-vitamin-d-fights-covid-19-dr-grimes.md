Mean vitamin D levels with Covid-19 infection and deaths.

Controls  30ng/ml

Covid-19  19ng/ml

Fatal Covid-19  8ng/ml

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7455115/

 **12. Heidelberg** 

Blood level of vitamin D predicting critical Covid-19 and deaths.

Vitamin D <12ng/ml

Hazard Ratio for invasive ventilation = 6.12 in those with lowest vitamin D levels

Hazard Ratio for death  =14.73 in those with lowest vitamin D levels.

 **13. Boston** 

Blood level of vitamin D predicting Covid-19 infection.

Vitamin D levels known and Covid-19 infection documented

Lowest level of vitamin D 20ng/ml, 12% risk of Covid-19 infection

Highest level 50–60ng/ml, 6% risk

Good blood level of vitamin D reduces risk of Covid-19 infection by 50%

 **16. Turkey** 

Association between blood vitamin D and severity of Covid-19.

Severe/critical disease 102 (68.5%). 66.7% died. Mean vitamin D 10.1 ng/ml. 

Moderate disease 47 (31.5%). 2.1% died. Mean vitamin D 26.3% ng/ml

 **17. Indianapolis** 

Prediction of positive Covid-19 test based on blood vitamin D levels.

Vitamin D ≧ 20ng/ml: 317 people, 39 (12%)  positive 

Vitamin D < 20ng/ml: 172 people, 32 (19%)  positive 

A low level of vitamin D (<20ng/ml, 50nmol/L) predicted an increased (x1.77) risk of becoming Covid-19 positive. 

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770157

These studies that have appeared suggest not just that vitamin D is very important in the escalation of defensive immunity in response to infection, but also that the blood level of vitamin D is a good surrogate for the measure of immunity. 

The studies indicate that a blood level of more than”30ng/ml (75nmol/L) is a level that indicates protection against serious or fatal Covid-19 infection. A target level of 40ng/ml (100nmol/L) would appear to be appropriate, and to achieve this vitamin D in a daily supplement of 4,000 units is effective, perfectly safe, and costs about £12 per year.

 **Interpretations** 

There are three dimensions to vitamin D in respect of Covid-19:

1. The importance of vitamin D as judged by its blood level and the association of vitamin D deficiency with unfavourable outcome and death.

1. The importance of vitamin D as judged by its blood value and its prediction of unfavourable outcome and death with vitamin D deficiency.

1. The favourable effect of giving a vitamin D supplement in the prevention of an unfavourable outcome.

 **In the above list there were:** 

* 8 association studies,

* 7 prediction studies

* 2 supplement studies (one randomised controlled)
