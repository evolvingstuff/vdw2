# Vitamin D Deficiency and Supplementation and Relation to Cardiovascular Health

- - - - - - - - - - - - - 

## Summary by VitaminDWiki:

11,000 cardiology patients in Kansas (2004-2009) were allowed to take any amount of vitamin D they wanted

They were analyzed as being in one of two groups: sufficient and deficient

Those with an average of 40 ng/ml of vitamin D did MUCH better than those with an average of only 17 ng/ml

2X fewer deaths after 5 years, lower blood pressure, less atrial fibrillation, less diabetes, lower weight, etc.

Recent evidence supports an association between vitamin D deficiency and hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. The effect of vitamin D supplementation, however, has not been well studied. We examined the associations between vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation, and patient outcomes in a large cohort. Serum vitamin D measurements for 5 years and 8 months from a large academic institution were matched to patient demographic, physiologic, and disease variables. 

The vitamin D levels were analyzed as a continuous variable and as normal (?30 ng/ml) or deficient (<30 ng/ml). Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard modeling were performed. 

Of 10,899 patients, the mean age was 58 ± 15 years, 71% were women (n = 7,758), and the average body mass index was 30 ± 8 kg/m2. The mean serum vitamin D level was 24.1 ± 13.6 ng/ml. Of the 10,899 patients, 3,294 (29.7%) were in the normal vitamin D range and 7,665 (70.3%) were deficient. 

Vitamin D deficiency was associated with several cardiovascular-related diseases, including 

* hypertension, 

* coronary artery disease, 

* cardiomyopathy, and 

* diabetes (all p <0.05). 

Vitamin D deficiency was a strong independent predictor of all-cause death 

(odds ratios 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.901 to 3.662, p <0.0001) after adjusting for multiple clinical variables. 

Vitamin D supplementation conferred substantial survival benefit (odds ratio for death 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.277 to 0.534, p <0.0001). 

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency was associated with a significant risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced survival. 

Vitamin D supplementation was significantly associated with better survival, specifically in patients with documented deficiency.

## Cardiology patients who were vitamin D sufficient

- 23% took vitamin D: between 1,000 IU daily to 50,000 IU every two weeks: 

-  had average 40 ng/ml of vitamin D

## The cardiology patients who were deficient had only 17 ng/ml

### The cardiology patients after 5 years:

* 4 % died who had average of 40 ng of vitamin D

* 8 % died who had average of 17 ng of vitamin D

## There were many measurable benefits of extra vitamin D
