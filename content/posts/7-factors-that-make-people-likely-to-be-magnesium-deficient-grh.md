#### 7 factors from [video](https://youtu.be/n1i_kceDSis?si=AkjvoYna7xk9OPVg)

 **1. Dietary factors** 

* people who don’t eat enough magnesium rich foods

* foods previously high in magnesium are no longer rich in magnesium due to farming or processing

* high intake of saturated fats can cause decreased absorption of magnesium in the intestines

* high sugar intake can cause an excessive amount of magnesium to be excreted by the kidneys, leads to less magnesium retention in the body

* carbonated drinks (especially those with phosphorus) can reduce the absorption of magnesium

 **2. Age – Older adults are at higher risk** 

* less magnesium absorption in the gut with age

* increased excretion of magnesium in the urine with age

* a higher likelihood of chronic diseases with age also increases the chance of taking a medication that can interfere with magnesium absorption and utilization (see below)

 **3. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes** 

higher concentrations of sugar in the blood increase excretion of magnesium in urine

 **4. Those taking certain medications** 

stomach acid reducers (such as Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, Pepcid, Tums)

  **5. People with excessive or uncontrolled stress** 

stress hormones eat up magnesium and can deplete magnesium stores

stress affects absorption in the gut, leading to less magnesium being absorbed

 **6. Alcohol dependence** 

alcohol interferes with magnesium absorption

increased alcohol consumption often leads to consuming less nutritious, magnesium rich foods

 **7. Gastrointestinal diseases** 

Malabsorption due to gastrointestinal disorders, such as Chrohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, Whipple’s disease, and others involving chronic diarrhea, can also cause decreased absorption and lead to deficiency

!!!!7 factors from [https://youtu.be/n1i_kceDSis?si=AkjvoYna7xk9OPVg|video]
__1. Dietary factors__
*people who don’t eat enough magnesium rich foods
*foods previously high in magnesium are no longer rich in magnesium due to farming or processing
*high intake of saturated fats can cause decreased absorption of magnesium in the intestines
*high sugar intake can cause an excessive amount of magnesium to be excreted by the kidneys, leads to less magnesium retention in the body
*carbonated drinks (especially those with phosphorus) can reduce the absorption of magnesium
__2. Age – Older adults are at higher risk__
*less magnesium absorption in the gut with age
*increased excretion of magnesium in the urine with age
*a higher likelihood of chronic diseases with age also increases the chance of taking a medication that can interfere with magnesium absorption and utilization (see below)
__3. Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes__
higher concentrations of sugar in the blood increase excretion of magnesium in urine
__4. Those taking certain medications__
stomach acid reducers (such as Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, Pepcid, Tums)
 __5. People with excessive or uncontrolled stress__
stress hormones eat up magnesium and can deplete magnesium stores
stress affects absorption in the gut, leading to less magnesium being absorbed
__6. Alcohol dependence__
alcohol interferes with magnesium absorption
increased alcohol consumption often leads to consuming less nutritious, magnesium rich foods
__7. Gastrointestinal diseases__
Malabsorption due to gastrointestinal disorders, such as Chrohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, Whipple’s disease, and others involving chronic diarrhea, can also cause decreased absorption and lead to deficiency
