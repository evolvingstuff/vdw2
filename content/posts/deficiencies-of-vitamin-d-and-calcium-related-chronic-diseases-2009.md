Vitamin D and calcium insufficiencies are risk factors for multiple chronic diseases. 

Data from 46 recent studies from Europe, North America, South-East Asia and the South Pacific area clearly indicate that a low vitamin D status and inadequate calcium nutrition are highly prevalent in the general population (30–80%), affecting both genders. 

The extent of insufficiencies is particularly high in older populations, and in some geographical areas, also in children and in young women of child-bearing age, in ethnic minorities and immigrants, as well as in people of low socio-economic status. 

Enrichment of cereal grain products with vitamin D and calcium would be a viable approach to increase consumption and improve health outcomes in the general population worldwide.

# Extracted from Table 1. Rating of evidence for association of vitamin D and/or calcium insufficiency with frequent chronic diseases

## A.   Convincing    evidence     from     multiple     epidemiological    (prospective,    cross-sectional, retrospective) large cohort studies, interventional trials and experimental studies

Osteoporosis

Cancer (colorectal, breast)

## B.   Good evidence from >3 observational studies and/or interventional trials

Cancer (renal , prostate, endometrial, ovarian, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, bladder) Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 

Cardiovascular disease

Neuromuscular dysfunctions Diabetes mellitus Type I Tuberculosis

Gingivitis

Periodontal disease, tooth loss

## C. Emerging evidence from observational studies

Hypertension Metabolic Syndrome Diabetes mellitus Type II

Cardiovascular disease

Hypertension

Neuromuscular dysfunctions

Periodontal disease, tooth loss

## D. Evidence mainly from studies with animal models of the respective human disease

Inflammatory bowel disease
