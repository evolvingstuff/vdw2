Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disturbed innate immune processes characterize the pathogenesis of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in COPD patients and has been associated with disease severity. Interestingly, a number of mechanistic evidence from animal and in vitro studies has demonstrated important innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and antimicrobial functions. In this review, we will discuss in detail how these innate immunomodulatory functions of vitamin D could provide therapeutic potential in COPD patients. Finally, the remaining challenges associated with vitamin D therapy in COPD patients will be discussed.

### Clipped from Conclusions

The airways and lung parenchyma of COPD patients are characterized by exaggerated inflammation, increased oxidative stress, impaired host defense and lung remodeling. As vitamin D could positively affect each of these processes, vitamin D therapy may have great therapeutic potential in COPD patients, who often present with vitamin D deficiency. Appropriate antimicrobial treatment is essential in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. However, repetitive and long-term treatment with antibiotics should still be avoided as they contribute to the multi-resistance of colonizing strains. Therefore, vitamin D could be a potential alternative due to its dual antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in the (pulmonary) immune system. Moreover, as vitamin D has been shown to improve responsiveness to GCs, co-administration of inhaled GCs and vitamin D may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of existing GC therapies in COPD patients. A subsequent lower but still efficacious dose of inhaled GCs may be beneficial by reducing the risk for pneumonia associated with high doses (Calverley, et al., 2007;Dransfield, et al., 2013;Ernst, et al., 2007;Wedzicha, et al., 2008).

Although an abundance of epidemiological and mechanistic studies support the potential benefit of vitamin D therapy in COPD patients, more well-designed trials are necessary to unravel the potential efficacy of vitamin D therapy in COPD patients. Here, the administration dose, form of vitamin D and route of administration should be taken into consideration. Additionally, it must be noted that vitamin D therapy may only be effective in COPD patients with defined vitamin D deficiency, as demonstrated in two intervention trials with high-dose vitamin D supplementation in COPD patients (Lehouck, et al., 2012;Martineau, et al., 2014). Taken together, despite the clear potential of vitamin D in reversing a disturbed innate immune defense in COPD, many unknowns remain. Further research is needed to implicate the therapeutic potential of local upregulation of vitamin D signaling in the lungs of patients with COPD.
