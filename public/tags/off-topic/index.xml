&lt;p>“In a 2013 study, a dozen doctors from around the country examined all 363 articles published in The New England Journal of Medicine over a decade — 2001 through 2010 — that tested a current clinical practice, from the use of antibiotics to treat people with persistent Lyme disease symptoms (didn’t help) to the use of specialized sponges for preventing infections in patients having colorectal surgery (caused more infections). Their results, published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, found 146 studies that proved or strongly suggested that a current standard practice either had no benefit at all or was inferior to the practice it replaced; 138 articles supported the efficacy of an existing practice, and the remaining 79 were deemed inconclusive.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off topic: great hearing amplifier - 10 cents per day per ear</title><link>/posts/off-topic-great-hearing-amplifier-10-cents-per-day-per-ear.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-great-hearing-amplifier-10-cents-per-day-per-ear.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="amazonhttpswwwamazoncomgpproductb01lz01qtqrefoh_aui_search_detailpageieutf8psc1">&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZ01QTQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">Amazon&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

Three weeks ago I read Clint Obers book on the medical benefits of free electrons from the Earth via grounding. What grabbed my interest was the amount of people with auto immune diseases reporting a sustained reduction of symptoms from daily grounding. I bought a Clint Ober bed mat and brought it with me to Spain. After about 10 days I noticed my energy and sense of vitality had improved. I love to walk in the hills here but since a relapse 3 years ago my legs prefer not to walk for more than 2 hours. This year on the 2 hour walks my legs felt like normal and I decided to do a walk I thought I would never do again. It is a 5 hour walk with a 400 meter elevation which is intense. I set off at 9 am and enjoyed a peaceful wander in the hills. My legs and energy were perfect and I felt like I had a new body.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I was grounded (verified) by socket tester for** 9 hours a night and two hours a day **with bare feet on soil for 12 days before this walk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Cancer Screening Has Never Saved Lives' (but Vitamin D supplementation does)</title><link>/posts/cancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-but-vitamin-d-supplementation-does.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-but-vitamin-d-supplementation-does.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="greenmedinfohttpwwwgreenmedinfocomblogcancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-bmj-study-concludes-1-jan-2016">&lt;a href="http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cancer-screening-has-never-saved-lives-bmj-study-concludes-1">GreenMedInfo&lt;/a> Jan 2016&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>“Developing drugs to treat late-stage disease is usually much faster than developing drugs to treat early-stage disease or prevention, because late-stage disease is aggressive and progresses rapidly.

 &lt;td>This category includes indicators assessing the general palliative and healthcare environment, as well the existence of a well-articulated, effective and widely implemented government strategy.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Human resources&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Trained specialists, medical professionals and support staff are key in ensuring available services are delivered in a professional and high-quality fashion.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Affordability of care&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Where care is available, it needs to be affordable. In this category we assess public funding as well as out-of-pocket expenses for accessing palliative care.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Quality of care&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Quality of care is the most important category in the Index. It assesses various dimensions of quality, including the availability of strong opioid analgesics (morphine and equivalents), monitoring standards in organisations and the availability of services such as psychosocial support for patients and their families.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>Community engagement&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The role of the community is important in palliative care, especially as volunteer workers are vital in the provision of care. In this category, we assess the availability and training for volunteer workers, and public awareness of palliative care.&lt;/td>

&lt;p>Evidence based medicine (EBM) wrong footed the drug industry for a while in the 1990s. We could fend off the army of pharmaceutical representatives because often their promotional material was devoid of evidence. But the drug industry came to realise that EBM was an opportunity rather than a threat. Research, especially when published in a prestigious journal, was worth more than thousands of sales representatives. Today EBM is a loaded gun at clinicians’ heads. “You better do as the evidence says,” it hisses, leaving no room for discretion or judgment. EBM is now the problem, fueling overdiagnosis and overtreatment.1 ⇑&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off topic – Making birth defects ‘preventable’ Folic acid and the politics of risk reduction</title><link>/posts/off-topic-making-birth-defects-preventable-folic-acid-and-the-politics-of-risk-reduction.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-making-birth-defects-preventable-folic-acid-and-the-politics-of-risk-reduction.html</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>We as the population of the world have suffered through many chronic diseases.  We are no different than people, especially people that claimed to be medical professionals, from two centuries ago.  Medicine is still practiced as an art with some science thrown in end to give credibility to our claims.  Now has the medical industrial complex once again deceived us with the introduction of folic acid to make up for our L-methyl folate deficiency?  A qualified answer to this question is yes. Folic acid is not a naturally occurring molecule.  It was first processed in the 1940’s in a laboratory.  In 1998, folic acid was added to ‘fortify’ foods, especially grains.  The reasoning was that the population and especially pregnant mothers were deficient.  This was causing neural tubes defects.  It is true that neural tube defects have been reduced and this is a good thing. Now researchers are saying that folic acid that remains in the blood stream is causing an increased incidence in several cancers including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.  &lt;strong>It seems that at least ten percent of the population has the MTHFR polymorphism&lt;/strong> and keeps folic acid from quickly being converted to methyl folate, the natural occurring substance in foods that our body uses.  Others have said that &lt;strong>at least seventy percent of the population has some form of polymorphism that slows the process&lt;/strong> .  The excess folic acid circulating in the blood causes a reduction in the action of our natural killer cells.  This is believed to be the issue of increased cancer rates. Also, the methyl folate is the primary contributing nutrient to the genetic switching that occurs from the methyl cycle.  How the methyl cycle is controlled in the body by methyl folate is extremely important and second only to the action of vitamin D.  Genetic switching is what keeps you healthy.  Whether the gene is properly turned on or off is critical to your health.  &lt;a href="http://randyjirtle.com/"> &lt;strong>Dr. Randy Jirtle&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> in his work at Duke University has shown this to be the case with his study on mice and methyl donors.  There is a host of chronic disease that you may review at the &lt;a href="http://mthfr.net/"> &lt;strong>MTHFR.net&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> website. If you consider that fortification begin in 1998, I believe this is about the same time the incidence of autism significantly increased.  The importance of folate to the neural system is that it acts directly in the mitochondrial body in the sulfur cycle.  Here the various sulfate molecules that the body needs are created.  The ones related to the neural system is the molecule that is created for the myelin sheath that covers the nerve pathways.   Without the integrity of this sheath, the neurons cannot appropriately fire because the sodium, potassium, and magnesium are not held closely to the neurons. Also a study in Italy that was designed to show the effect of folate on heart disease, it was found that there was thickening of the cartilage in patients with higher amounts of folate.  I am sure this effect is caused by genetic switching with cofactors like B6, B12, and vitamin D. I have not been able to find a vitamin B complex supplement that has methyl folate and not folic acid.  In the practice of medicine, folic acid and folate are considered to be the same compound.  Folic acid is the oxidized form of L-methyl folate NOT A NATURALLY OCCURING COMPOUND.  This is the same error that was made with vitamin D when vitamin D2 was said to be equal to vitamin D3.  In the 1930’s when the substitution was made to vitamin D2 is when the cases of vitamin D toxicity started to occur in the medical literature. What can you do?  Stop supplementing with all forms of folic acid.  Be careful in how much food you consume that has been fortified with folic acid.  Maybe this is one of the primary issues with wheat.  &lt;a href="http://www.wheatbellyblog.com/"> &lt;strong>Dr. William Davis in his book, “Wheat Belly”&lt;/strong> &lt;/a>  says there are many issues with wheat.  &lt;strong>Fortification of our cereal with folic acid may have exacerbated the situation and is causing more chronic disease&lt;/strong> .  Methyl folate is available in many foods, especially dark leafy greens like spinach.  A &lt;a href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/"> &lt;strong>boiled half cup of spinach has about 134 micrograms&lt;/strong> &lt;/a> of folate.    In the consumption of beans, black-eyed peas are the highest at 105 mcg per one half cup.  Liver has the highest amount in the meats at 215 mcg in one half cup. There many brands of methyl folate supplements on the market.  Try to get at least 400 mcg per day from your foods, if not supplement.  As I was writing this my wife called to see what I wanted for dinner.  I suggested boiled spinach, black-eyed peas, and liver cook with onions (for the sulfate).  She hung up the phone.  I did actually get turnip greens, black-eyed peas, and steak.  Not the best but close.  Maybe the popular attitude of the 50’s and 60’s was correct.   “I’m strong to the finish ‘cause I eats me spinach, I’m Popeye the sailor man!”  Sing along! What a medical professional – Popeye!   – Pandemic Survivor&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off topic: Low-income black churches interest in early disease detection</title><link>/posts/off-topic-low-income-black-churches-interest-in-early-disease-detection.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-low-income-black-churches-interest-in-early-disease-detection.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Article below is from &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/09/03/it_really_does_take_a_village_how_memphis_is_fixing_healthcare/">Salon – Sept 2013&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
