Background: Vitamin D deficiency is common in pregnant women. There is scarce information in the Asia-Pacific region on the understanding of vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy among health care professionals.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study among health care professionals who are part of the Integrated Platform for Research in Advancing Metabolic Health outcomes of Women and Children (IPRMAHO) international study group on their understanding and perception of Vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy. The cross-sectional survey comprised 4 main sections: demographics, existing policies, nutrient supplementation in pregnancy and various practices on screening, treatment and perceptions, with a total of 22 questions. A total of 15 responses were obtained from attendees from distinct health facilities across eleven participating Asia-Pacific countries.

Results: Majority of the surveyed hospitals (11/15, 78.6 %) did not have a national policy or regional guideline regarding Vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy. More than half of respondents were (9/14, 64.3 %) were unsure of the percentage of women seen with Vitamin D deficiencies each year and were unsure of Vitamin D dosage prescribed to pregnant women with (8/15, 53.3 %) or without (6/14, 42.9 %) Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D was rarely prescribed in pregnancy when compared to other nutrient supplements such as folic acid and iron. Majority of respondents (9/11, 72.7 %) indicated that their hospital did not screen for Vitamin D deficiencies in pregnancy, even amongst high risk pregnant women. Nevertheless, majority of respondents indicated a need (12/15, 80.0 %) for a guideline or consensus regarding Vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy.

Conclusion: While majority of the surveyed hospitals did not have a national policy or regional guideline regarding Vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy, majority of reÂ­spondents indicated a need for the policy or guideline. There were varying clinical knowledge gaps and different perceptions on Vitamin D screening and supplementation in pregnancy among healthcare professionals.
