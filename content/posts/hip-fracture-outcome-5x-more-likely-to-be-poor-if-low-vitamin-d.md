OBJECTIVE:

The main objective of the current study was to assess the distribution and its prognostic value of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span> D) levels assessed at admission in Chinese postmenopausal women with hip fracture.

METHODS:

From January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013, all postmenopausal women with first-ever hip fracture were recruited to participate in the study. Serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels were measured at admission. The functional evaluation at the time of discharge was performed by the Barthel Index (BI). The prognostic value of 25<span>[OH]</span> D to predict the functional outcome within discharge was analyzed by logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for the possible confounders.

RESULTS:

In our study, 261 patients were included and assessed. In the 76 patients with an unfavorable functional outcome, serum 25(OH) D levels were lower compared with those in patients with a favorable outcome [11.8(IQR, 9.9-16.1) ng/ml; 16.8(IQR, 13.6-21.4) ng/ml, respectively; P<0.0001](11.8(IQR,%209.9-16.1)%20ng/ml;%2016.8(IQR,%2013.6-21.4)%20ng/ml,%20respectively;%20P<0.0001). 

In multivariate analysis, there was an increased risk of unfavorable outcome associated with serum 25(OH) D levels  **â‰¤ 20 ng/ml (OR 5.24** , 95%CI: 3.11-8.15; P<0.0001) after adjusting for possible confounders.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our data support an association between serum 25<span>[OH]</span> D levels and prognosis in Chinese postmenopausal women with hip fracture.
