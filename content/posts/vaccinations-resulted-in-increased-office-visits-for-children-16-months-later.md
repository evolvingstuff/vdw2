#### Office Visits vs days since birth for 15 health problem

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Note: Increased Office Visits for vaccinated children start about day 500</span>**

 **Comment on this study by a Pediatric Nurse (LLB)** 

Most office visits in young children are well checks/immunization visits. Therefore, these study results are meaningless because the metric is meaningless.

If you studied prescriptions for kids you'd have a little better numbers, but even then, the same people who are attentive to their children's health and trust the medical system will be bringing their kids in for antibiotics for ear infections, instead of letting the kids attempt to ride it out. 

Hospitalizations would be a great better metric. 

In addition, most pediatricians are pretty persuasive about immunizations, particularly in kids with underlying health problems. So kids with serious asthma, etc. are more likely to be vaccinated.

#### Paper was retracted by the publisher July 2021 (when there is great COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy)

* "The concern centered primarily on the question of whether the large differences in the number of medical visits required for attention to specific health conditions like anemia, gastroenteritis, asthma, ear infections and many others, were due to parents who did not vaccinate not showing up to their well-baby and well-child visits."

* "Because Thomas’ license was suspended, he had to focus on his case and try to keep his life from falling apart; the medical board kept postponing the hearing, and no hearing had occurred."

* "In fact, no hearing has been held to date."

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/increase-all-health-problems.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

We performed a retrospective analysis spanning ten years of pediatric practice focused on patients with variable vaccination born into a practice, presenting a unique opportunity to study the effects of variable vaccination on outcomes. The average total incidence of billed office visits per outcome related to the outcomes were compared across groups  **(Relative Incidence of Office Visit (RIOV))** . RIOV is shown to be more powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full cohort, cumulative incidence analyses, matched for days of care, and matched for family history analyses were conducted across quantiles of vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to many diagnoses were robust to days-of-care-matched analyses, family history, gender block, age block, and false discovery risk.

Many outcomes had high RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care (e.g.,

* anemia (6.334),

* asthma (3.496),

* allergic rhinitis (6.479), and

* sinusitis (3.529), all significant under the Z-test).

Developmental disorders were determined to be difficult to study due to extremely low prevalence in the practice, potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine cessation upon adverse events and family history of autoimmunity.

Remarkably,  **zero**  of the 561 unvaccinated patients in the study  **had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder**  (ADHD) compared to 0.063% of the (partially and fully) vaccinated.

The implications of these results for the net public health effects of whole-population vaccination and with respect for informed consent on human health are compelling. Our results give agency to calls for research conducted by individuals who are independent of any funding sources related to the vaccine industry.

While the low rates of developmental disorders prevented sufficiently powered hypothesis testing, it is notable that the overall rate of  **autism**  spectrum disorder (0.84%) in the cohort is **half that of the US national rate**  (1.69%). The practice-wide rate of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate.

The data indicate that unvaccinated children in the practice are not unhealthier than the vaccinated and indeed the overall results may indicate that the unvaccinated pediatric patients in this practice are healthier overall than the vaccinated.

 **Clipped from PDF** 

* "We have been keenly aware of the brewing political controversies around vaccination studies, including the public’s increased awareness of the dearth of long-term randomized prospective clinical studies that  **use inert placebos such as saline** ."

* "Parents are almost universally told by their child’s health care provider that the health issue was not due to the vaccine, in spite of growing evidence in the scientific literature that supports both plausible mechanisms of action for chronic illnesses including epidemiological associations. "
