Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism and its association with multiple myeloma (MM) development.

Methods

The peripheral blood of 40 MM cases and 84 healthy controls were collected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing were applied to detect VDR gene polymorphism (including: FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI). SHESIS biological information software was used to analyze genotypes, alleles, linkage disequilibrium (LD), haplotype distribution, and their association with MM.

Results

Compared with controls, the MM group had a significantly higher frequency of the A allele in 

* BsmI site (8.7% vs 2.4%) and 

* C allele in the TaqI site (10.5% vs 3.6%). 

These two alleles were closely associated with an increased risk of MM (P = .025; P = .030). The highly rare genotypes (BsmI‐AA and TaqI‐CC) were found in one patient with MM.

Conclusion: VDR gene polymorphisms may be a molecular marker of MM risk.
