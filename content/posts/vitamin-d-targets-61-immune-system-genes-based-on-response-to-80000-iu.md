The vitamin D3 metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), its nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor) and hundreds of their target genes are not only key regulators of calcium homeostasis, but also important modulators of the immune system. Innate immune cells like monocytes use VDR for efficient differentiation and are very responsive to vitamin D. So far, most information on the gene regulatory function of vitamin D and its physiological impact had been obtained from in vitro studies using supraphysiological doses of 1,25(OH)2D3. 

Therefore, medical experiments like the study VitDHiD (NCT03537027), where 25 healthy individuals were supplemented once with a vitamin  **D3 bolus (80,000 IU)** , provide important insight into the response to vitamin D under in vivo conditions. In this study, we inspected 452 in vivo vitamin D target genes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) detected in VitDHiD and found 61 of them involved in eight major KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of innate immunity. 

Under in vivo conditions in healthy individuals vitamin D either 

* silences five pathways of innate immunity, 

* stabilizes two and 

* increases one, 

so that acute inflammation is suppressed and the release of cytokines is kept under control. 

A ranking of the 61 target genes by inducibility, basal expression and multiple involvements in the pathways highlighted the genes 

* NFKBIA (NFκB inhibitor alpha), 

* NFKBIZ, 

* FOSL2 (FOS like 2, AP1 transcription factor subunit), 

* JDP2 (Jun dimerization protein 2), 

* PIK3R1 (phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1), 

* CLEC7A (C-type lectin domain containing 7A), 

* DUSP6 (dual specificity phosphatase 6), 

* NCF2 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 2), 

* PLCB1 (phospholipase C beta 1), 

* PLCG2 and TNFAIP3 (TNF alpha induced protein 3). 

In conclusion, vitamin D’s in vivo effect on innate immunity in healthy adults is mediated by the interconnection of the pathways of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, Toll-like receptor, chemokine and phagosome signaling, NOD-like receptor, C-type lectin receptor, apoptosis and interleukin 17 through a limited set of proteins encoded by key target genes.
