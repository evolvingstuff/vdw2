#### Vitamin D3 Boosted Immune Cells: Scientists Discover Promising New Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis

 **[Science Daily](https://scitechdaily.com/vitamin-d3-boosted-immune-cells-scientists-discover-promising-new-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis/)** 

* "Researchers are investigating a new, more targeted approach that involves using a type of immune cell called tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs), derived from the patients themselves, to target the disease more precisely."

* "TolDCs can restore immune balance without affecting the body’s natural defenses. However, since a hallmark of MS is precisely the dysfunction of the immune system, the effectiveness of these cells for autotransplantation might be compromised. Therefore, it is essential to better understand how the disease affects the starting material for this cellular therapy before it can be applied.'

* "In this study, published at the prestigious Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers examined CD14+ monocytes, mature dendritic cells (mDCs), and Vitamin D3-treated tolerogenic dendritic cells (VitD3-tolDCs) from MS patients who had not yet received treatment, as well as from healthy individuals."

__[https://scitechdaily.com/vitamin-d3-boosted-immune-cells-scientists-discover-promising-new-treatment-for-multiple-sclerosis/|Science Daily]__
*&quot;Researchers are investigating a new, more targeted approach that involves using a type of immune cell called tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs), derived from the patients themselves, to target the disease more precisely.&quot;
*&quot;TolDCs can restore immune balance without affecting the body’s natural defenses. However, since a hallmark of MS is precisely the dysfunction of the immune system, the effectiveness of these cells for autotransplantation might be compromised. Therefore, it is essential to better understand how the disease affects the starting material for this cellular therapy before it can be applied.&#39;
*&quot;In this study, published at the prestigious Journal of Clinical Investigation, researchers examined CD14+ monocytes, mature dendritic cells (mDCs), and Vitamin D3-treated tolerogenic dendritic cells (VitD3-tolDCs) from MS patients who had not yet received treatment, as well as from healthy individuals.&quot;
