* “The problem is that kidney disease is initially silent. Damage progresses slowly and quietly through five stages. Stage 5 is considered end-stage kidney failure. At that point, only two procedures — dialysis or transplantation — can keep a person alive.”

Dark skin ==> Low Vitamin D

Smoking ==> Low Vitamin D

Obesity ==> Low Vitamin D

Low vitamin D ==> Diabetes ==> Kidney failure

Low vitamin D ==> High blood pressure ==> Kidney failure
