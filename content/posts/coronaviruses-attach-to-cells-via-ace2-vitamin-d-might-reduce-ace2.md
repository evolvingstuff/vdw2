 **Fact**  All Coronavirus attach to ACE2 enzyme in human cells

 **Suspected**  Vitamin D reduces ACE2 enzyme

 **Fact**  All previous human Coronavirus are fought by Vitamin D

 **Hypothesis**  Vitamin D will also fight the new form of Coronavirus, COVID-19

 **CVD, Diabetes, and Hypertension All share the following** 

1) Disease associated with a big increase in COVID-19 death

2) Disease appears to be treated with ACE inhibitors

High levels of ACE2 result in better attachment by all coronaviruses (this page)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">It appears that the drugs taken for the diseases are the cause of the increased death rate</span>**

Several studies confirmed that Wuhan Coronovirus uses ACE2 connection

* "... January 23, a research group from Wuhan’s Institute of Virology reported they had tested live samples of the new virus against human cell lines expressing ACE2 proteins and those without ACE2. It could only infect the ones that carried the receptor."

* From Discussion: "The mRNA expression levels of ACE and ACE2 in NT, LPS, and LPS + calcitriol-treated lung tissues were also determined, and the results demonstrated that LPS increased ACE expression and decreased ACE2 levels compared with the NT group. Calcitriol treatment **inhibited**  the effects of LPS on ACE and ACE2 mRNA expression."

#### 42-minute YouTube video concerning Vitamin D, Coronavirus and ACE2

 **[Slides are in German, but they are described by the author in English](https://www.vitamindservice.de/coronavirus-e)** 

ACE2 controls blood pressure.

When the Coronavirus takes over the ACE2, the blood pressure rises (in the lungs)

The video also overviews many previous Vitamin D studies on respiratory viruses.
