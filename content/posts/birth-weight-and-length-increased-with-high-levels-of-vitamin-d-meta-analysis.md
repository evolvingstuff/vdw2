The new pooled analysis showed the  **effect of vitamin D is larger with the same direction**  for 

* circulating 25-OHD (mean difference <span>[MD]</span>, 70.69 vs. 66.46 nmol/L), 

* preeclampsia (relative risk <span>[RR]</span>, 0.89 vs. 0.88), 

* gestational diabetes (RR, 1.08 vs. 1.05), 

* low birth weight (RR, 0.84 vs. 0.72),

* preterm birth (RR, 1.30 vs. 1.26), 

* birth weight (MD,108.62 vs. 107.60 g), and 

* birth length (MD, 0.79 vs. 0.30 cm). 

The new pooled analysis shows that the effect of vitamin D is smaller with the same direction for small for gestation age (RR, 0.69 vs. 0.78).
