Background. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) has been associated with inflammation, HIV disease progression and death. We aimed to identify the prognostic value of 25(OH)D for AIDS, non-AIDS-defining events and death, and its association with immunological/inflammatory markers.

Methods. Prospective 1-1 case–control study nested within the EuroSIDA cohort. Matched cases and controls for AIDS (n=50 matched pairs), non-AIDS-defining (n=63) events and death (n=41), with plasma samples during follow-up were selected. Conditional logistic regression models investigated associations between 25(OH)D levels and annual 25(OH)D change and the probability of events. Mixed models investigated relationships between 25(OH)D levels and immunological/inflammatory markers .

Results. 250 patients were included. Median time between first and last sample and last sample and event was 44.6(IQR:22.7-72.3) and 3.1(IQR:1.4-6.4) months. Odds of death decreased by 46.0%(95%CI:2.0–70.0,P=0.04) for a twofold increase in latest 25(OH)D level. There was no association between 25(OH)D and the occurrence of AIDS or non-AIDS-defining events (P>0.05). In patients with current 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL, hsIL-6 concentration increased by 4.7%(95%CI:0.2,9.4,P=0.04) annually after adjustment for immunological/inflammatory markers, and no change in hsCRP rate was observed (P=0.76).

Conclusions. Low Vitamin D predicts short term mortality in HIV-positive persons. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on inflammation and patient outcomes should be investigated.
