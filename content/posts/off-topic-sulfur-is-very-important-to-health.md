Dr. Rhonda Patrick ( [FoundMyFitness](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/)) posted 

 **Sulforaphane and Its Effects on Cancer, Mortality, Aging, Brain and Behavior, Heart Disease & More** 

The time has come for me to finally release my video on sulforaphane. You guys got a little bit of an audio-only preview a while back, but this has been revised: we made some corrections and then also added citations, figures, graphs, quotations from the studies, etc. for pretty much absolutely everything discussed.

Here's the bottom-line of why I'm so excited about this video: 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">sulforaphane is probably one of the most important health-promoting compounds in existence.</span>** 

I believe if, as a world population, everyone started increasing their intake of isothiocyanates just a little bit, we'd see a complete shift in the disease curve worldwide. The research is that promising.

 **[WATCH THE SULFORAPHANE VIDEO NOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4YVJ4aRfg%20) YouTube** 

My goal with this video was to distill down the most interesting parts of a huge body of literature into an coherent narrative that people can follow. I think I've mostly achieved that... but I was so excited about this topic that I decided to reach out to a name I was seeing show up on the studies I was reading time and time again: Dr. Jed Fahey of Johns Hopkins. We ended up recording a 2 hour interview of completely non-overlapping material that is actually very complimentary and also covers surprisingly practical information! He's been one of the driving forces ultimately moving this field forward... his lab has also played a critical role in providing the "infrastructure" (e.g. broccoli sprout extracts) to labs looking to do this type of research. Expect to see that conversation very soon as a follow-up!

Okay, but enough about upcoming videos... here's the low-down on what's in THIS video. Just a few of the effects talked about in the video that are related primarily to supplementation of sulforaphane (or broccoli sprouts or other isothiocyanate-rich foods)...

* Profound changes in lipid biomarkers, reducing heart disease risk by as much as 50% in humans.

* Massive reductions in cancer risk in humans and also highly effective as a cancer intervention, particularly prostate and breast but also many others.

* Steep reductions in inflammation in humans.

* Possible implications for neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic brain injury.

* Shown in mice to be as effective as Prozac as an anti-depressant.

* Steep behavioral changes in humans with respect to certain neurological disorders, such as autism.

* Causes dramatic boosts in the excretion of certain air pollutants and cigarette carcinogens (up to 60%) in humans.

In some ways, however, to try to distill this video down to just a few bulletpoints of effects really does feel like it diminishes the value of these compounds a bit... so I hope you watch the whole thing! Please do that. Then share it with a friend.

I've created a timeline, which I'll attach to the bottom of this message, to help you skip around a little bit and also give you a sense of what's actually in the video too. This is also attached to the YouTube video's description.

That's it for now... as a closing thought: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING A PART OF THIS! I could NOT have done this without you guys. It took too much time that I wouldn't have otherwise been able to invest. Ultimately, it took more time than what is clearly part of the stated goals for my channel (in terms of frequency)... but, without your support, I couldn't have taken on a big piece like this and I knew that it was a story that deserved to be told. It was too important and there was too much literature to cover and to try to break it into smaller pieces would've left the viewer without a sense of the momentousness of what was being discussed.

Thank you for letting me do this!

Rhonda
