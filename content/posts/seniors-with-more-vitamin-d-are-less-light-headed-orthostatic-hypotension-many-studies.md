#### Orthostatic hypotension  1.36 X more likely if low vitamin D – meta-analysis Oct 2021

 **Orthostatic hypotension and vitamin D deficiency in older adults: systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Aging Clin Exp Res [doi: 10.1007/s40520-021-01994-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01994-w)

Background: Over the latest years different studies have investigated the possible relationship between D deficiency and occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (OH), often reaching controversial results. We perform an update meta-analysis providing an update overview on the association between hypovitaminosis D and orthostatic hypotension (OH) in older adults.

Methods: Data extraction was independently performed by two authors and based upon predefined criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic.

Results: Eight investigations enrolling 16.326 patients (mean age 75.5 years) met the inclusion criteria and were considered for the analysis. Patients with vitamin D deficiency were more likely to have OH compared to those without  **(OR: 1.36** , 95% CI 1.14-1.63, p = 0.0001, I2 = 43.6%). A further sub-analysis, based on three studies, estimating the risk of OH in patients with hypovitaminosis D receiving antihypertensive treatment, did not reach the statistical significance (OR: 1.40, 95% CI 0.61-3.18, p = 0.418, I2 = 53.3%). Meta-regression performed using age (p = 0.12), BMI (p = 0.73) and gender (p = 0.62) as moderators did not reveal any statistical significance in influencing OH. Conversely, physical activity, Vitamin D supplementation and use of radioimmunoassay for the measurement of vitamin D serum levels showed a significant inverse relationship towards the risk of OH (Coeff.-0.09, p = 0.002, Coeff. - 0.12, p < 0.001 and Coeff. - 0.08, p = 0.03, respectively) among patients with hypovitaminosis D. A direct correlation between the administration of antihypertensive treatment and the risk of OH in older patients with low vitamin D level was observed (Coeff. 0.05, p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Hypovitaminosis D is significantly associated with OH in older adults and directly influence by the administration of antihypertensive drugs. Conversely, physical activity, vitamin D supplementation and use of radioimmunoassay as analytic method inversely correlated with the risk of OH in older patients.

#### Hypotention 3.4 X more likely if low vitamin D – June 2016

 **Factors associated with orthostatic hypotension in hospitalized elderly patients - June 2016**

OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH) in hospitalized elderly patients.

DESIGN: Prospective observational single center study.

SETTING: A French academic center.

PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and thirty-one patients without OH symptoms who underwent OH testing.

MEASUREMENTS:

The OH test was performed when the patient was able to get out of the bed and was no longer receiving parenteral fluids. The blood pressure was measured after a 10-min rest while the patients were sitting and then standing at 1 and 3 min. Demographic data, co-morbidities, current medications and biological parameters were recorded.

RESULTS:

The mean patient age was 84.3 ± 7 years. The mean CIRS-G score was 10.6 ± 3.8. The OH test was performed 6.3 ± 3.9 days after admission and was positive in 39 (29.8 %) patients (95 % confidence interval (CI) 22, 38) and positive at 1 min in 87.2 % of the cases. Multivariate analysis showed that OH prevalence correlated with diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 4.23; 95 % CI 1.10, 16.24; P = 0.03), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/ml (OR = 3.38; 95 % CI 1.36, 8.42; P = 0.008), use of tranquilizers (anxiolytic and hypnotic) (OR = 2.96; 95 % CI 1.18, 7.4; P = 0.02), CIRS-G score (OR = 1.15; 95 % CI 1.01, 1.31; P = 0.03) and lack of diuretics (OR = 0.20; 95 % CI 0.06, 0.63; P = 0.005).

CONCLUSION:

In older adults, OH is often misdiagnosed because it is asymptomatic. As practitioners may be reluctant to perform the OH test because of time constraints, targeting a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of OH should be worthwhile to prevent further OH complications.

#### Orthostatic hypotension <span style="color:#F00;">2X</span> more likely if low vitamin D - meta-analysis March 2016

 **Hypovitaminosis D and orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.**

OBJECTIVES:

Orthostatic hypotension is a common condition among older adults and is associated with a range of deleterious outcomes. Recently, interest has developed in hypovitaminosis D (defined as low 25 hydroxiyvitamin D levels) as a potential risk factor for orthostatic hypotension. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association of orthostatic hypotension between study participants with and without hypovitaminosis D, including the adjustment of potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, renal function, comorbidities, seasonality, use of antihypertensive medications, and supplementation with cholecalciferol).

METHODS:

A systematic literature search of major electronic databases from inception until 09/2015 was made for articles providing data on orthostatic hypotension and hypovitaminosis D. A random effects meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies investigating orthostatic hypotension prevalence comparing participants with vs. those without hypovitaminosis D was undertaken, calculating the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS:

Of 317 initial hits, five cross-sectional studies were meta-analysed including 3646 participants (1270 with hypovitaminosis D and 2376 without). The participants with hypovitaminosis D had a higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension ( **OR = 1.88** ; 95% CI: 1.25-2.84; I = 68%) that was not affected by adjusting for a median of five potential confounders ( **OR = 2.03** ; 95% CI: 1.13-3.68; I = 73%). People with orthostatic hypotension had significantly reduced serum vitamin D concentrations (standardized mean difference = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.12). One longitudinal study confirmed the association between hypovitaminosis D and orthostatic hypotension.

CONCLUSION:

Our meta-analysis highlights that hypovitaminosis D is associated with orthostatic hypotension, independent of potential confounders. Further longitudinal studies and clinical trials are required to confirm these findings.

#### Orthostatic hypotension 3.4 X more likely in elderly if low Vitamin D - Sept 2014

 **Vitamin D deficiency is associated with orthostatic hypotension in oldest-old women** 

J Intern Med. 2014 Sep;276(3):285-95. [doi: 10.1111/joim.12201.](https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.12201.) Epub 2014 Apr 22.

Annweiler C1, Schott AM, Rolland Y, Beauchet O.

OBJECTIVES: Orthostatic hypotension, a condition that mostly affects 'oldest-old' (i.e. ≥80 years) adults, is primarily explained by age-related dysfunction of blood pressure control. Vitamin D may contribute to blood pressure control. The aim of this study was to determine whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with orthostatic hypotension in oldest-old adults.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the EPIDOS study.

SETTING: Five French areas.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 329 community-dwelling oldest-old women (mean age 83.3 ± 0.2 years).

MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES:

Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure drop of ≥20 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure drop of ≥10 mmHg within 3 min of standing. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration ≤10 ng mL(-1) . Covariates included in the models were age, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, supine mean arterial pressure, number of drugs taken per day, use of antihypertensive or psychoactive drugs, cognition, quadriceps strength, current smoking, alcohol consumption, serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone, calcium and creatinine and season of testing.

RESULTS:

Diastolic orthostatic hypotension was observed more often among women with vitamin D deficiency (19.2%) compared to those without (10.0%; P = 0.03). There was an inverse linear association between 25OHD concentration and change in diastolic blood pressure after 3 min of standing (adjusted β = -0.07, P = 0.046). Similarly, 25OHD deficiency was associated with orthostatic hypotension <span>[adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.36, P = 0.004]</span>, specifically with diastolic orthostatic hypotension (adjusted OR 3.81, P = 0.003).

CONCLUSIONS:

25OHD deficiency was associated with orthostatic hypotension in oldest-old women, due to a greater drop in diastolic blood pressure on standing. This finding may lead to better understanding of the pathophysiology of falls in oldest-old adults with vitamin D deficiency.
