### Email from Keith Baggerly  11/21/17

 **Keith Baggerly kabagg@mdanderson.org is the son of Leo and Carol Baggerly of GrassrootsHealth** 

 **Just the facts.** 

About a year ago, concerns were raised about mathematical errors in the

Insitute of Medicine (IOM) report on vitamin D. These errors could have 

led to recommended intakes being set too low.

In response, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and 

Medicine (NASEM) convened expert panels to review the issue in 

two phases. In the first phase, one expert panel was asked to 

determine whether or not statistical errors were indeed present. 

The second phase would kick in if the first was answered in the 

affirmative. In the second phase, another expert panel (with

some overlap with the first panel) would be charged with determining 

if and how the IOM report's recommendations should be changed in light

of the errors identified.  

The reports from these two phases are now posted on the web page for the original report

[http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2010/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Calcium-and-Vitamin-D.aspx](http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2010/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-for-Calcium-and-Vitamin-D.aspx)

The links are near the bottom of the page, in the paragraph

> Note: In response to claims of methodological errors in this report after its release, the National Academies undertook a two-phased review process to identify whether errors had been made and if so what effect those errors had on the findings. Here are the reports of the two review panels: Phase I and Phase II.

#### The Phase I report is here

https://www.nap.edu/resource/13050/Vit%20D%20panel%20report%20final.pdf

#### The Phase II report is here

https://www.nap.edu/resource/13050/FINAL%20Vitamin%20D%20Phase%20II%20Panel%20Report_11-17-17.pdf

The report has been issued.  Keith (Baggerly) is looking in depth which you are certainly encouraged to do as well.  It's a big question now as to what we should do. Carole (Baggerly)

#### The bottom lines:

* The first panel agreed there were indeed mathematical errors in the  IOM report. 

* The second panel, however, found that the errors identified would  not have affected the final recommendations made, so these remain unchanged.

 **Comment on the above email from Canada** 

"How was it not viewed a conflict of interest to have a committee member on the second panel, responsible for determining if RDA should be adjusted, who was the Chair of the committee that produced the initial 2010 IOM report under investigation???"
