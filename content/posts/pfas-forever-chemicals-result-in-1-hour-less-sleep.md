#### Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances and disrupted sleep: mediating roles of proteins

Environmental Advances Volume 17, October 2024, [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envadv.2024.100585](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envadv.2024.100585)

Background

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination may disrupt sleep through disrupted metabolic and immune functions. The study aims to investigate the association and potential mechanism between PFAS and sleep.

Methods

We included  **136 young adults**  recruited between 2014-2018 and 76 were re-assessed between 2020-2022. Additional 8 participants only had complete data between 2020-2022. Plasma PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFPeS, PFNA, PFDA) were measured at both visits using liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. Plasma proteins were measured by Olink® Explore 384 Cardiometabolic and Inflammation Panel I. Sleep duration was self-reported at both visits along with follow-up sleep disturbance and sleep-related impairment using validated instruments. We utilized multiple linear regression to explore the association between individual PFAS (in tertile) and these sleep outcomes. PFAS associated with sleep outcomes were subjected to computational toxicology analysis using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database and Toxicology in the 21st Century database to identify potential genetic links between them. Mediation analysis using proteomic data was then performed to confirm the findings from computational toxicology analysis.

Results

At baseline, one tertile increase in 

* PFDA was associated with 0.39 (95 % CI: 0.05, 0.73) hours of shorter nightly sleep duration, 

* and, at follow-up PFHxS and PFOA were associated with 0.39 (95 % CI: 0.05, 0.72) 

   * and 0.32 (95 % CI: 0.01, 0.63) hours shorter sleep duration, respectively

* One tertile increase in PFOS exposure was associated with a 2.99-point increase in sleep disturbance scores (95 % CI: 0.67, 5.31) 

   * and a 3.35-point increase in sleep-related impairment scores (95 % CI: 0.51, 6.20).

Computational toxicology and mediation analyses identified potential mediating roles for several proteins in the PFAS-sleep associations, including 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 1 (HSD11B1), cathepsin B (CTSB) and several immune system-related proteins.

Conclusion

Future large scale epidemiological and mechanistic studies should confirm our findings and test effect measure modification of the associations by age.
