#### Association Between Pretreatment Blood 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Level and Survival Outcomes in Patients With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis

Studies on the prognostic value of the blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level have yielded controversial results in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. This updated meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between pretreatment 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with survival outcomes among patients with clinically localized PCa. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched to identify studies evaluating the association of pretreatment 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with PCSM and all-cause mortality among clinically localized PCa patients. Ten cohort studies with 10,394 patients were identified. The meta-analysis revealed that PCa patients with the lowest 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels had an increased risk of PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span>  **1.52** ; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 1.26-1.83; p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.00-1.90; p = 0.047) compared to those with higher reference 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. Subgroup analyses based on different sample sizes, follow-up duration, and adjusted times of blood draw also exhibited a significant association of vitamin D deficiency with the risk of PCSM. Lower pretreatment level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be an independent predictor of reduced survival in patients with clinically localized PCa. Measuring the pretreatment blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level can provide valuable information for risk stratification of survival outcomes in these patients.
