Background

Surgeons and hospitals increasingly face penalty for complications and readmission following total joint arthroplasty (TJA), therefore optimization of modifiable risk factors is paramount. Literature associates low vitamin D with risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), and we hypothesized low vitamin D to be predictive of increased rate of complications and readmissions.

Methods

A retrospective review of 126 revision TJA patients between 2010-2014 was performed.

Results

Low vitamin D was not associated with risk of 30-day readmission, but was found to be associated with an increased risk of 90-day complications as well as PJI as the reason for revision surgery.

Conclusions

Preoperative vitamin D level should be considered a modifiable risk factor for complications following revision arthroplasty.
