OBJECTIVES:

To determine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and the likelihood of postoperative complications and fracture reoperation rate in orthopaedic trauma patients receiving vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series.

SETTING: Level I trauma center, Midwestern United States.

PATIENTS:

All orthopaedic trauma patients-18 years or older-over a 20-month period were included with available initial and repeat 25(OH)D serum levels. In total, 201 patients met inclusion criteria.

INTERVENTION:

All patients received 1000 IU of vitamin D3 and 1500 mg of calcium daily. Vitamin D deficient and insufficient patients also received 50,000 IU of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) weekly until 25(OH)D levels normalized or fractures healed.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: fracture complications and 25(OH)D levels.

RESULTS:

Fifteen patients experienced postoperative healing complications. There was no significant difference between initial (P = 0.92) or repeat (P = 0.91) 25(OH)D levels between patients with and without fracture healing complications. Twenty-eight patients required repeat orthopaedic surgery. There was no significant difference between initial (P = 0.62) or repeat (P = 0.18) 25(OH)D levels between patients who did or did not require repeat orthopaedic surgery. There was no significant difference between initial (P = 0.66) or repeat (P = 0.89) 25(OH)D levels between patients who did or did not require nonorthopaedic surgery.

CONCLUSIONS:

Serum 25(OH)D levels did not significantly affect the likelihood of fracture healing complications requiring surgery or any nonorthopaedic injury-related surgery.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.
