 **ABSTRACT** 

Most of the world’s population has vitamin D levels which are suboptimal for healthy immune system function. Recent recommended goals are far higher than legacy guidelines, which are based entirely upon promoting bone health, rather than on supporting all the many other functions of vitamin D. Vitamin D strengthens the innate immune response, decreasing the likelihood of infection from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Vitamin D also regulates the adaptive immune system and inflammation. Thus, with appropriate levels, infected persons have a reduced likelihood of developing hyperinflammatory (severe) Covid-19 (the cytokine or bradykinin “storm”). Many experts have noted that vitamin D plays a role in preventing every one of the disorders associated with severe Covid-19. In addition, the risk factors for getting severe Covid-19 are identical to the risk factors for becoming vitamin D deficient. Evidence of a link between low vitamin D levels and poor Covid-19 outcomes is robust, including numerous population and individual correlational studies, causal modeling, prospective cohort intervention studies, and randomized controlled trials.
