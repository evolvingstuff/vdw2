#### If I feel hungry I drink some water  
The body confuses thirst with hunger  
20 minutes after drinking, if I am still hungry, I eat a snack or have a meal.

### That has been my only weight control technique for 30 years (now 70 years old)

* Reduce your calorie intake

> “Research suggests replacing other beverages with pure water typically lowers your overall caloric intake by about 9 percent, or 200 calories a day”

* Reduce your appetite (for older subjects)

* Comment by a Mercola Reader matches mine 

> “Many years ago, like 25 or so, I was sitting in a doctors office waiting for my appointment.  While sitting there I picked up a medical journal that had the subject of drinking water and how you can tell whether your hunger pains are hunger or thirst.  So I read the article and it suggested that if you feel hungry and it's not your normal eating time, to drink at least 6-8 ounces of water and wait at least 15 minutes.  If your body is just thirsty for water, your hunger pains will go away.  It also indicated that this is the only way your body can tell you it's thirsty other than a dry throat.  Most people relate the hunger pains as being hungry.  This is why the article suggests drinking the water first and then wait. the 15 minutes.  If you are still getting the hunger pains after that, then by all means eat something.  I have followed that protocol every since and have learned that is how my body tells me it wants more water.  I now and for many years, drink more water than anything else.  I'm 61 years old and get guessed for 40-45 years old.  No wrinkles in my face per say.  I love it.”
