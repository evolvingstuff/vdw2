<th>CRD summary</th>

<td>

<p>This  review concluded that limited data suggested moderate-to-high doses of  vitamin D supplements may reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but  calcium supplements may not. Given the potential for missed studies,  clinical differences between studies and paucity of good quality data,  the reliability of the pooled results is uncertain. However, the  authors' conclusions seemed suitably cautious.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Authors'  objectives</th>

<td>

<p>To assess whether vitamin D and calcium  supplements reduced the risk for cardiovascular events in adults.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Searching</th>

<td>

<p>MEDLINE,  EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)  were searched for studies published in English from 1966 to July 2009;  search terms were reported. Reference lists of retrieved articles were  searched.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Study selection</th>

<td>

<p>Two reviewers  independently selected prospective studies of adults (?19 years) that  compared vitamin D supplements, calcium supplements or a combination  against no supplements. Studies had to report cardiovascular disease  outcomes (cardiovascular disease death, nonfatal coronary heart disease,  myocardial infarction and&#160;nonfatal stroke). Many of the included  studies were only in women, or only in patients who received  haemodialysis;&#160;some studies were only in men and others&#160;in a mixed  population. Where reported, mean age ranged from 54 to 74 years.  Supplement doses varied. All trials had placebo groups.</p>

<tr>

<th>Validity  assessment</th>

<td>

<p>Studies were graded for quality in the following  categories: good (no obvious bias); fair (bias was insufficient to  invalidate the results); and poor (substantial bias).</p>

<p>The authors did not state how many reviewers performed the study  quality assessment.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Data extraction</th>

<td>

<p>Data  were extracted on order to calculate relative risks (RR) and 95%  confidence intervals (CI). One reviewer extracted data and&#160;two other  reviewers checked independently. Disagreements were resolved by  consensus.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Methods of synthesis</th>

<td>

<p>Meta-analyses  were used to pool relative risks and 95% CIs from randomised controlled  trials (RCTs) using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was  calculated using the Cochran Q statistic. Publication bias was assessed  using the Begg adjusted rank correlation test.</p>

<th>Results  of the review</th>

<td>

<p>Seventeen studies were included: eight  prospective cohort studies (n=271,214); eight&#160;RCTs (n=43,646, range 192  to 36,282 participants); and one nested case-control study (n=1,000).  Follow-up periods ranged from 90 days to eight years. Four cohort  studies were rated good, three fair and two&#160;poor. Four RCTs were rated  fair and four poor.</p>

<p>Five studies of patients who received dialysis showed consistent  reductions in cardiovascular mortality in those who received vitamin D  supplements;&#160;one study of a general population showed no statistically  significant reductions. Four studies of initially healthy persons found  no differences in incidence of cardiovascular events between calcium  supplement recipients and non recipients.</p>

<p><font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">RCTs showed no  statistically significant reductions</font> in cardiovascular events  with vitamin D supplementation (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; two  studies), calcium supplementation (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.41; three  studies) and&#160;a combination of vitamin D and calcium supplementation (RR  1.04 95% CI 0.92 to 1.18; two studies) compared with placebo. There was  no evidence for publication bias or significant heterogeneity.</p>

</td>

<tr>

<th>Authors'  conclusions</th>

<td>

<p>Limited data suggested that vitamin D  supplements at moderate-to-high doses may reduce cardiovascular disease  risk;&#160;calcium supplements seemed to have minimal cardiovascular effects.</p>

<th>CRD  commentary</th>

<td>

<p>The review addressed a clear question and was  supported by appropriate inclusion criteria. Attempts to identify  relevant studies were undertaken by searching electronic databases and  checking references, but the restriction to studies published in English  <font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">means that relevant  studies may have been missed and the review may have been prone to  language and publication biases. Suitable methods were employed to  reduce risks of reviewer</font> error and bias for the processes of data  extraction and study selection;&#160;the authors did not report on whether  such methods were used when assessing study quality. There was a paucity  of good-quality evidence and the authors' <font style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">assessment of study  quality was used when</font> interpreting the results of the review.  However, the very limited reporting of criteria used to assess bias made  it difficult to assess the relative merits of individual studies.  Sufficient study details were provided and an appropriate meta-analysis  of the data was undertaken. The authors noted that none of the RCTs were  designed to answer the review question. Although the reliability of the  pooled results is uncertain, the authors' conclusions seemed suitably  cautious.</p>

<th>Implications of the review for practice  and research</th>

<td>

<p><u>Practice</u>: The authors did not state any  implications for practice.</p>

<p><u>Research</u>: The authors stated that future studies of vitamin D  and calcium supplement use among initially healthy persons were needed  urgently, particularly large-scale randomised trials with adequate doses  and with cardiovascular disease ascertained as the primary end point.</p>
