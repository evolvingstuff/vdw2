#### [The Vaccine Safety Myth](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/vaccine-safety-myth) GreenMedInfo Feb 2015

* Pharmaceutical companies are indemnified by the government against liability

* National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out over  **3 billion dollars**  to date

* Cochrane conclusion: The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vaccine studies, both pre- and post-marketing, are largely inadequate.

* The US childhood immunization schedule requires 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year, the most in the world,

* 33 nations have better infant mortality rates than the US

* Story has a link to the vaccines which include aluminum and the 75 Pubmed articles on  **autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants** 

* Has a link to  **Massive Fraud In Merck MMR Vaccine Testing.**

* "The MMR vaccine was introduced in Japan in April 1989, and parents who refused the compulsory vaccine were fined.

* Disney outbreak. . . "even though 18% of the measles cases occurred in those who had been vaccinated against it "

#### Over $4 Billion paid out in US vaccine compensations as of June 2018

 **[Zero Tolerance Vaccine Laws in America: Will You Defend Vaccine Freedom?](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/zero-tolerance-vaccine-laws-america-will-you-defend-vaccine-freedom) GreenMedInfo** 

* "Recent surveys reveal that 20 percent of Americans think vaccines may be unsafe and 45 percent are not sure."

   * :There has been almost a 10 percent decline in public confidence in vaccine safety over the past decade:

* "There are only two laws that require American citizens to risk their lives."

1. Miltary Draft

1. state law requiring all healthy children to risk their lives in a war that doctors declared on microbes two centuries ago

* "..Congress gave doctors a broad liability shield in 1987 similar to the one they gave to vaccine manufacturers in 1986 to protect them from most vaccine injury lawsuits"

>  **US govt has so far paid out $4 billion - but manufactures and doctors have paid out $0**
