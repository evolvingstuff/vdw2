#### From a Sept study of eyeglasses and a June meta-analysis of 172 studies

 **<span style="color:#F00;">80%</span> reduction if just wear glasses  (Chinese - worn for Myopia)** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">78%</span> reduction if just wear face shield** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">85%</span> reduction if just wear mask** 

 **[Joint probability Calculation](https://www.calculator.net/probability-calculator.html): Wear Glasses +Wear Mask = 97%**

Face shield can also provide some protection for the eyes. A review of studies of coronavirus transmission found that the use of eye protection (face shields, visors or goggles) found that the use of eye protection was associated with 78% less infection than with no eye protection, with the researchers noting that "Eye protection is typically underconsidered and can be effective in community settings." (Chu, Lancet 2020). 

In fact, even eyeglasses may provide some protection: A study of COVID-19 patients in a hospital in China found that only 16 of 276 patients (or 5.8%) wore glasses (i.e., at least 8 hours per day for near-sightedness) compared to an estimated 31.5% of the general population, suggesting that wearers of eyeglasses may be less susceptible to COVID-19. The eyes are considered an important channel for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the body (Zeng, JAMA Opthal 2020).

   * It may be that eyeglasses act as a partial barrier, protecting eyes from the splatter of a cough or sneeze. 

   * Another explanation for the finding could be that people who wear glasses are less likely to rub their eyes with contaminated hands.
