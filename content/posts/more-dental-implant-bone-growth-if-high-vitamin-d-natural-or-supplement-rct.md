#### Good Dental implant if high vitamin D RCT - 2021

Introduction: The most important factor which is responsible for the positive course of implant treatment is the process of osseointegration between the implant structure and the host’s bone tissue. The aim of this study was to assess what effect the 25-hydroxycholecalciferol concentration and vitamin D deficiency treatment have on changes in the bone level at the implant site during the process of osseointegration in the mandible. 

Materials and Methods: The study was with 122 people qualified for implant surgery, who were assigned to three research groups (A, B, and C). Laboratory, clinical, and radiological tests were performed on the day of surgery, and after 6 and 12 weeks. The bone level in the immediate proximity of the implant was determined by radiovisiography (RVG). 

Results: The bone level after 12 weeks in Groups B and C was significantly higher than after 6 weeks. The bone level in the study Group B was significantly higher than in Group A. The study showed that the higher the levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol were observed on the day of surgery, the higher was the level of bone surrounding the implant after 6 and 12 after surgery. 

Conclusion: The correct level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the day of surgery and vitamin D deficiency treatment significantly increase the bone level at the implant site in the process of radiologically assessed osseointegration.

#### Vitamin D Supplementation for Prevention of Dental Implant Failure: A Systematic Review - Jan 2022

Background. Many factors play a significant role in osseointegration and healing after dental implant insertion and restoration. Some factors are related to dental biomaterials, such as the dental implant, prosthesis, and grafting materials. Other factors can be connected to operator skills and accumulated experience. Local and systemic patient-related factors are crucial in determining the success of the dental implant. Thorough examination and analysis of local factors using available examination tools are vital to prepare the implant candidate for such treatment. The patient’s systemic condition directly affects the healing of the dental implant. One of the most overlooked systemic factors is the patients’ vitamin D level, which influences bone formation around the implant and subsequent osseointegration. The current review examined the available literature regarding the association between vitamin D supplementation and dental implant osseointegration. Methods. Data of this review were derived from recent research available on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Inclusion criteria were the relation between the vitamin D serum and dental implant osseointegration or failure. The Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was followed to perform the review. The study’s outcome was the need for vitamin D supplementation to prevent implant failure. Results. Five human studies (including case reports, case series, and retrospective studies) and six animal studies. All included studies discussed the relationship between vitamin D, early dental implant failure, and bone implant contact. Three retrospective studies found no significant relationship between vitamin D supplementation and EDIFs in humans. On the other hand, one retrospective study showed a significant relationship in humans. A case report and case series claimed that the implant was successfully placed after vitamin D supplementation. A total of four animal studies showed a significant relationship between vitamin D supplementation and osseointegration of the dental implant. Two animal studies showed no significant association. Conclusion. To ensure optimal treatment outcomes, it is recommended to supplement the patient with vitamin D if the serum level is not within the normal range. Further clinical studies and case reports are needed to confirm the association between serum vitamin D levels and osseointegration.
