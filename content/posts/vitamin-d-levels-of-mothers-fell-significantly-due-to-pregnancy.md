Prospective longitudinal study of vitamin D status and its risk factors in 75 pregnant women from early pregnancy until 6 months postpartum, by serial measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels. 

The serum levels at booking were  **not**  significantly different between 

nationalities (p = 0.06), parity (p = 0.2), 

education levels (p = 0.4), 

dress code (p > 0.5), 

consumption of vitamin D fortified milk (p = 0.2) or, 

fatty fish (p = 0.5), 

sun-exposed body surface area (p = 0.3), 

weekly time exposed to the sun (p = 0.08) or the sun exposure index (p = 0.2). 

 **Vitamin D status progressively worsened**  as the proportion with adequate serum levels fell from 31% at the antenatal visit, to 

23% after birth and 

17%, 6 months later (p = 0.02). 

While 80% of mothers who were exclusively breast-feeding had low vitamin D levels 6 months after delivery, this occurred in only 67% of those partially breast-feeding (p = 0.6). PMID: 20143971
