Few studies, and with controversial results, analyzed vitamin D status in children before and after growth hormone (GH) treatment. Thus, we aimed to assess vitamin D status in prepubertal children with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to evaluate the effect of GHD and GH treatment on vitamin D levels. Fifty prepubertal children with isolated GHD were compared with 50 controls. All were subjected to history, anthropometric assessment and measurement of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), serum calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) at diagnosis and 1 year after GH therapy. Serum 25(OH)D levels <30 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL were defined as vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, respectively. 25(OH)D was lower in cases than controls. 

Forty per cent of children with GHD were 25(OH)D insufficient and 44% deficient, while 16% were sufficient at baseline. There was a positive correlation between 25(OH)D and peak GH levels. Peak GH was a significant predictor of 25(OH)D levels. After 1 year of GH therapy, 25(OH)D increased (18.42±5.41 vs 34.5±10.1 ng/mL; P<0.001). Overall, 22% of cases remained insufficient and 24% deficient, with an increase in prevalence of children with normal levels (54%; P<0.001). 25(OH) correlated negatively with PTH (r=-0.71, P=0.01).

In conclusion, hypovitaminosis D is prevalent in children with GHD and significantly improved 1 year after GH therapy. 25(OH)D should be assessed in children with GHD at diagnosis and during follow-up.
