!!!Vitamin D Nutritional Status and Antenatal Depressive Symptoms in African American Women
Journal of Women&#39;s Health. Online Ahead of Print: July 23, 2012

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with depression; however, no studies have examined the relationship of vitamin D and antenatal depression. Antenatal depression increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes and poorer postpartum maternal and infant health. African American women are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and antenatal depression. Thus, we examined if early pregnancy vitamin D nutrition (VDN) was associated with antenatal depressive symptoms among African American women in the second trimester of pregnancy.

Methods: Women (n=178) were recruited from obstetrics clinics of a large health system. VDN was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). 
Depression symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale; 
CES-D?16 equates with criteria for __clinical depression__. 
Logistic regression was used to examine the association of log-transformed 25-OHD and elevated depression symptoms (CES-D?16).

Results: Mean 25-OHD was 13.4±8.4?ng/mL; most women (82.6%, n=147) were vitamin D inadequate or deficient (25-OHD&lt;20?ng/mL). 
Mean CES-D was 15.2±10.7, and 74 (41.6%) women had a CES-D?16, suggestive of clinical depression.
A significant inverse relationship was found between log (25-OHD) and CES-D?16 (odds ratio __[OR] 0.54__, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.99, p=0.046). 

__For every 1-unit increase in log (25-OHD) (corresponding to 2.72?ng/mL increase in 25-OHD), the odds of CES-D?16 decreased by 46%.__

Conclusions: African American women with lower VDN exhibit increased depressive symptoms. 
Research on vitamin D supplementation for reducing antenatal depressive symptoms is needed.

!!Summary by VitaminDWiki
#Fact: Depresion is associated with low levels of vitamin D
#Fact: Dark skin women have lower vitamin D than those with white skins
#Fact: Pregnancy decreases vitamin D

*Note: Without supplementation vitamin D levels drop in early pregnancy and remain low for up to a year after birth,
