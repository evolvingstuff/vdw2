 **Highlights** 

* Pre-clinical RA stage is the window of opportunity in RA treatment.

* Gut microbiota alteration may promote immune system dysfunction and joint damage.

* Balancing gut microbiota may restore immune system dysfunction.

* Combination therapy target on microbiota need to be developed.

* Microbiota based intervention is promising in prevent RA development.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive polyarthritis that leads to cartilage and bone damage. Pre-clinical RA is a prolonged state before clinical arthritis and RA develop, in which autoantibodies (antibodies against citrullinated proteins, rheumatoid factors) can be present due to the breakdown of immunologic self-tolerance. As early treatment initiation before the onset of polyarthritis may achieve sustained remission, optimize clinical outcomes, and even prevent RA progression, the pre-clinical RA stage is showing the prospect to be the window of opportunity for RA treatment.

Growing evidence has shown the role of the gut microbiota in inducing systemic inflammation and polyarthritis via multiple mechanisms, which may involve molecular mimicry, impaired intestinal barrier function, gut microbiota-derived metabolites mediated immune regulation, modulation of the gut microbiota's effect on immune cells, intestinal epithelial cells autophagy, and the interaction between the microbiome and human leukocyte antigen alleles as well as microRNAs.

Since gut microbiota alterations in pre-clinical RA have been reported, potential therapies for modifying the gut microbiota in pre-clinical RA, including natural products, antibiotic therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, microRNAs therapy, vitamin D supplementation, autophagy inducer-based treatment, prebiotics, and diet, holds great promise for the successful treatment and even prevention of RA via altering ongoing inflammation.

In this review, we summarized current studies that include pathogenesis of gut microbiota in RA progression and promising therapeutic strategies to provide novel ideas for the management of pre-clinical RA and possibly preventing arthritis progression.
