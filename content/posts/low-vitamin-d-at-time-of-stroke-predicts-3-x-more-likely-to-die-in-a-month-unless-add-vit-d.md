BACKGROUND:

The aim of this study is to determine 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> levels in serum, and investigate their associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or all-cause mortality in a 1-year follow-up study in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.

METHODS:

From November 2013 to October 2015, 387 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke admitted to our hospital were identified. Serum 25(OH) D levels were measured at admission. Infarct volume was measured using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The primary end point was CVD mortality among 1year. The secondary end point was all-cause mortality.

RESULTS:

In this study, 387 patients were included. A statistically significant negative correlation between serum 25(OH) D level and infarct volume was found (r=-0.442; P<0.001). There were 74 patients (19.1%, 95%CI: 15.2%-23.0%) died, including 36 CVD mortality (9.3%, 95CI%: 6.4%-12.2%). The mortality distribution across the 25(OH) D quartiles ranged between 39.2% (first quartile) to 5.2% (fourth quartile) for all-cause mortality and between 18.6% (first quartile) to 2.1% (fourth quartile) for CVD mortality. In a multivariate model using the first quartiles of 25(OH) D vs. quartiles 2 through 4 together with the clinical variables, the marker displayed prognostic information CVD mortality: OR for first quartile, 3.06 <span>[95% CI, 2.16-4.95]</span>; all-cause mortality: OR for first quartile, 2.76 <span>[95% CI, 2.01-4.32]</span>.

CONCLUSIONS:

The data show serum levels of 25(OH) D at admission is useful prognostic marker of CVD and all-cause mortality in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke.

#### 3.9 X more likely to die of stroke if low Vitamin D - Feb 2018

 **Vitamin D deficiency in relation to the poor functional outcomes in nondiabetic patients with ischemic stroke.** 

Biosci Rep. 2018 Feb 5. pii: BSR20171509. [doi: 10.1042/BSR20171509.](https://doi.org/10.1042/BSR20171509.)

Objective To assess the hypothesis that vitamin D, reflected by 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> would be associated with higher risk of poor functional outcomes among nondiabetic stroke patients. 

Methods This study was conducted in Nanchang, China. Serum concentration of 25(OH) D and NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) were measured at the time of admission. Functional outcome was measured by modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 1 year after admission. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models. The cut point of 25(OH) D level for vitamin D deficiency was 20ng/ml.

Results In this study, 266 nondiabetic subjects with stroke were included. One hundred and forty-nine out of the 266 patients were defined as vitamin D deficiency (56%). The poor outcome distribution across the 25(OH) D quartiles ranged between 64% (first quartile) to 13% (fourth quartile). In those 149 patients with vitamin D deficiency, 75 patients were defined as poor functional outcomes, giving a prevalence rate of 50% (95% confidence interval<span>[CI]</span>: 42%-58%). In multivariate analysis models, for vitamin D deficiency, the adjusted risk of poor functional outcomes and mortality increased by 220% (odds ratios <span>[OR]</span>: 3.2; 95% CI, 1.7-4.2, P<0.001) and 290% (OR: 3.9; 95% CI, 2.1-5.8, P<0.001), respectively. 

Conclusions Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome events in Chinese nondiabetic stroke individuals.
