 **Note: A person far from the equator and outdoors for 3 hours   
 &amp;nbsp; WIll get little vitamin D if only  morning or late afternoon   
 &amp;nbsp; With dark skin will get little vitamin D  
 &amp;nbsp; A person with concealing clothes will get little Vitamin D** 

Background &amp; aims

Many determinants of vitamin D status have been well-described, yet supplementation guidelines largely follow a one-size-for-all model and deficiency remains common. We hypothesised that accounting accurately for ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation and considering interactions could advance understanding of vitamin D status.

Methods

Asian, Black, and White participants from the UK Biobank cohort were included (N = 438,978). The Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service provided UVB data which we linked to participants&#39; place of residence. UVB dose over 135 days prior to blood draw was weighted and added, yielding cumulative and weighted UVB (CW-D-UVB). The association between 25(OH)D and selected variables was assessed in multivariable linear regression models with and without interactions, stratified by ethnicity. Predictors were ranked using standardised β-coefficients.

Results

Median 25(OH)D differed by ethnicity (Asian: 25.4 nmol/L (10.2 ng/mL), Black: 30.6 nmol/L (12.2 ng/mL), White: 47.9 nmol/L (19.2 ng/mL), p-value &lt; 0.001). CW-D-UVB was strongly associated with 25(OH)D in all ethnicities. It was the most important predictor in White (βAsian = 0.15, βBlack = 0.20, βWhite = 0.35), whereas supplementation was in Asian and Black participants (βAsian = 0.30, βBlack = 0.24, βWhite = 0.21). We identified statistically significant interactions between BMI:supplementation (all), CW-D-UVB:sex (Asian and White), and CW-D-UVB:age (Black and White), and in White population between CW-D-UVB and supplementation, BMI, and cholesterol.

Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency was widespread, particularly among non-White individuals. UVB was a strong predictor of 25(OH)D and the effect was modified by other factors. Findings suggest that accurately measured ambient-UVB radiation and interactions could improve 25(OH)D prediction models, and support personalised approaches to vitamin D optimisation.

~~#00F:__Note: A person far from the equator and outdoors for 3 hours %%% ~hs~ WIll get little vitamin D if only  morning or late afternoon %%% ~hs~ With dark skin will get little vitamin D%%% ~hs~ A person with concealing clothes will get little Vitamin D __~~
Background &amp; aims
Many determinants of vitamin D status have been well-described, yet supplementation guidelines largely follow a one-size-for-all model and deficiency remains common. We hypothesised that accounting accurately for ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation and considering interactions could advance understanding of vitamin D status.
Methods
Asian, Black, and White participants from the UK Biobank cohort were included (N = 438,978). The Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service provided UVB data which we linked to participants&#39; place of residence. UVB dose over 135 days prior to blood draw was weighted and added, yielding cumulative and weighted UVB (CW-D-UVB). The association between 25(OH)D and selected variables was assessed in multivariable linear regression models with and without interactions, stratified by ethnicity. Predictors were ranked using standardised β-coefficients.
Results
Median 25(OH)D differed by ethnicity (Asian: 25.4 nmol/L (10.2 ng/mL), Black: 30.6 nmol/L (12.2 ng/mL), White: 47.9 nmol/L (19.2 ng/mL), p-value &lt; 0.001). CW-D-UVB was strongly associated with 25(OH)D in all ethnicities. It was the most important predictor in White (βAsian = 0.15, βBlack = 0.20, βWhite = 0.35), whereas supplementation was in Asian and Black participants (βAsian = 0.30, βBlack = 0.24, βWhite = 0.21). We identified statistically significant interactions between BMI:supplementation (all), CW-D-UVB:sex (Asian and White), and CW-D-UVB:age (Black and White), and in White population between CW-D-UVB and supplementation, BMI, and cholesterol.
Conclusion
Vitamin D deficiency was widespread, particularly among non-White individuals. UVB was a strong predictor of 25(OH)D and the effect was modified by other factors. Findings suggest that accurately measured ambient-UVB radiation and interactions could improve 25(OH)D prediction models, and support personalised approaches to vitamin D optimisation.
