Dysregulated serum concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins in dogs with chronic enteropathy

Background: In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of humans, nutrient malabsorption can result in fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, especially of vitamin D. In veterinary species, decreased concentrations of vitamin D are relatively common in dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), but data on the status of other fat-soluble vitamins (FSVs) is lacking.

Objectives: Determine the serum concentrations of retinol, vitamin D, and α-tocopherol in dogs with CE compared with healthy dogs and compare clinical, clinicopathologic variables between CE and healthy dogs to detect associations with decreased FSVs concentrations.

Animals: Eighteen client-owned dogs with CE and 33 healthy dogs.

Methods: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D), serum retinol and α-tocopherol concentrations were compared between groups. Correlations and multiple regression modeling were used to examine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, retinol, and α-tocopherol concentrations and clinical and clinicopathological variables.

Results: Dogs with low serum albumin concentrations were more likely to have lower 25(OH)D concentrations than dogs with normal serum albumin concentration. Dogs with CE had higher serum concentrations of retinol, and variable α-tocopherol concentrations. The cause of these dysregulated vitamin concentrations is unclear and requires further study.

Conclusion and clinical importance: Dogs with severe forms of CE should be monitored for decreased concentrations of 25(OH)D. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the clinical relevance and the possible benefit of vitamin D supplementation in these patients.
