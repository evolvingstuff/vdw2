#### 2X more likely to survive if >20 ng of vitamin D after CC surgery - April 2019

 **Higher Post-Operative Serum Vitamin D Level is Associated with Better Survival Outcome in Colorectal Cancer Patients.** 

Nutr Cancer. 2019 Apr 4:1-8. [doi: 10.1080/01635581.2019.1597135.](https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2019.1597135.)

25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) may have a prognostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, as 25-OHD concentration is strongly impacted by surgery, it is uncertain what is the most reliable time-point for 25-OHD assessment, pre- or post-operative. Therefore, we examined 515 CRC patients (AJCC I-III) who underwent surgery. Blood samples were collected either pre-operatively (n = 286; median = 1 day before surgery) or post-operatively (n = 229; median = 8 days). Serum 25-OHD concentration was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Association between 25-OHD and survival was tested in the whole cohort, followed by stratified analyses in pre- and post-operatively sampled. Median 25-OHD in the cohort was 36.7 nmol/L and median follow-up time was 5.9 years. There were no differences between pre- and post-operative cohort in age, sex, 25-OHD, AJCC stage, or localization of tumor. 

After adjustment, higher 25-OHD (>50 nmol/L) was associated with better overall survival only in post-operative ( **HR = 0.53** ; 95% CI: 0.33-0.84; P = 0.006), but not in pre-operative cohort (HR = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.77-1.65; P = 0.53). In conclusion, higher post-operative 25-OHD levels were associated with better survival outcome in CRC patients, while no such association was found for pre-operative levels. Time-point of blood collection should be addressed carefully in future research as it might affect the prognostic value of 25-OHD in CRC.
