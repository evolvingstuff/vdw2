Objective

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with insulin resistance and obesity. 

Prospective population-based data regarding development and possible predictors of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in PCOS are limited.

Design: National Register-based study.

Methods

Patients with PCOS (PCOS Denmark and embedded cohort; PCOS OUH) and a control population with no previous diagnosis of T2D. PCOS OUH (N=1,162) included premenopausal women with PCOS and standardized clinical and biochemical examination. PCOS Denmark (N=18,477) included women with PCOS in the Danish National Patient Register. Three age-matched controls were included per patient (N=54,680).

Main outcome: T2D events according to diagnosis codes and filled medicine prescriptions.

Results

The median (quartiles) follow up was 11.1 (6.9 - 16.0) years. The Hazard ratio (95% CI) for development of T2D in PCOS Denmark was **4.0**  (3.7; 4.3) (p<0.001) and the total event rate of T2D was 8.0 per 1000 patient years in PCOS Denmark vs. 2.0 per 1000 patient years in controls (p<0.001). The median age at diagnosis of T2D was 31 (26-37) years in PCOS Denmark vs. 35 (27-44) years in controls (p<0.001). In multiple regression analyses, body mass index, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, 2 hour blood glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and triglycerides were positively associated with development of T2D, whereas higher number of births was negatively associated with development of T2D.

Conclusion: The event rate of T2D was higher in PCOS compared to controls and T2D was diagnosed at a younger age.
