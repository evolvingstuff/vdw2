Received: 28 October 2013; in revised form: 27 November 2013 / Accepted: 28 November 2013 / Published: 16 December 2013

Objective: Clarify the concept of vitamin D sufficiency, the relationship between efficacy and vitamin D status and the role of Vitamin D supplementation in the management of non-skeletal diseases. We outline reasons for anticipating different serum vitamin D levels are required for different diseases. 

Method: Review the literature for evidence of efficacy of supplementation and minimum effective 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in non-skeletal disease. 

Results: Evidence of efficacy of vitamin supplementation is graded according to levels of evidence. 

Minimum effective serum 25-OHD levels are lower for 

* skeletal disease, e.g., rickets (25 nmol/L), osteoporosis and fractures (50 nmol/L), than for 

* premature mortality (75 nmol/L) or non-skeletal diseases, e.g., depression (75 nmol/L), diabetes and cardiovascular disease (80 nmol/L), 

* falls and respiratory infections (95 nmol/L) and 

* cancer (100 nmol/L). 

Conclusions: Evidence for the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation at serum 25-OHD levels ranging from 25 to 100 nmol/L has been obtained from trials with vitamin D interventions that change vitamin D status by increasing serum 25-OHD to a level consistent with sufficiency for that disease. This evidence supports the hypothesis that just as vitamin D metabolism is tissue dependent, so the serum levels of 25-OHD signifying deficiency or sufficiency are disease dependent.
