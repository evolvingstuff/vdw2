Based on observational studies, one could also be hopeful that vitamin D could prevent much more than rickets—as a “silver bullet” for many diseases. High intakes of vitamin D, sun exposure, and high serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D; the marker of vitamin D status]</span> are all associated with good health. Conversely, low serum 25(OH)D concentrations are consistently associated with the presence of chronic disease risk factors, including hypertension, and predict future diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and even mortality (1).
