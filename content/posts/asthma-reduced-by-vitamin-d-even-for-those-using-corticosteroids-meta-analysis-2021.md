#### Vitamin D can safely reduce asthma exacerbations among corticosteroid-using children and adults with asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials

Previous studies have failed to draw a consistent conclusion over the effect of vitamin D administration on asthma. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation could improve the clinical efficacy of corticosteroids in patients with asthma as measured by exacerbations, Asthma Control Test (ACT) score, and lung function in order to maintain asthma control. We searched Web of Science, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect up through January 20, 2021 for randomized controlled trials analyzing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on asthma exacerbation. Studies were limited to patients with moderate to severe asthma who were treated with corticosteroids. 

We identified 12 studies involving 1,543 participants in this meta-analysis. Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the risk of asthma exacerbation ( **pooled risk ratio (RR)**  0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59, 0.83; P < .05). The pooled RR of the ACT score was 0.04 (95% CI, -0.19, 0.27; P > .05). The pooled standardized mean difference in vitamin D levels was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.77, 1.38; P < .05), and in the percentage of forced expiratory volume in one second was -0.02 (95% CI, -0.13, 0.09; P > .05). The pooled RR of adverse events was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.89, 1.25; P > .05). We performed subgroup analysis and meta-regression of serum vitamin D levels but found no source of heterogeneity. Vitamin D supplementation safely reduced the rate of asthma exacerbation but did not improve ACT score or lung function among patients with asthma treated with corticosteroids.
