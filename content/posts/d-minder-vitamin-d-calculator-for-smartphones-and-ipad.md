## D Minder Vitamin D status - based on exposure to sunlight

 **Comments by Henry Lahore, admin of VitaminDWiki Dec 2013** 

D Minder "appears" to perpetuate the mistake of showing the amount of vitamin D one would get with UVB from all directions (such as in a tanning bed).  

This is about 2X more than what one would get from the unidirectional sun - which does not illuminate all sides of your body at the same time.

It makes no compensation for the amount of vitamin D from the sun vs time of day

It shows the same amount of vitamin D for 20 minutes at noon as 20 minutes just before 3 PM

&nbsp; &nbsp; while UVB is actually about 45% less at 3PM, and there is a huge amount more of UVA

D Minder sharply cuts off Vitamin D at Oct 22 for my location (Seattle)

whereas in reality vitamin D gradually changes during the year, and not at a single date.

I entered Ecuador as a location (with high altitude and near the equator)

D Minder says that a person would get 8,000 IU in 30 minutes at 9 AM with only 10% of skin exposed, (born  1946)

^Update  Jan 2014  They appear to have eliminated the ability to specify where you are located

Update May 2016 No change in amount of vitamin D generated when I changed birth date from 1946 to 1996^

D Minder does not allow calculation with amount of skin exposed of < 5% = burka, etc.

D Minder has an error in that it shows amount of vitamin D two days ago as being 0 IU - independent of age, altitude, etc

It is difficult to tell D Minder the amount vitamin D from the sun which you had gotten on a vacation

Doubt that it makes the correct calculation for obesity, as it only enters weight. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vitamin D is apparently stored far more in fat than in muscle.

D Minder does not account for lying down vs. standing up (a 2X - 4X difference)
