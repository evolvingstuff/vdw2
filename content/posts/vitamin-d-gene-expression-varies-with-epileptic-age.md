**Note: The study on this page refers to: CYP27B1, &nbsp; CYP24A1, and &nbsp; VDR** 

The effects of those genes are not detected by a blood test

Those genes are included in the following chart

Vitamin D deficiency has been detected in epileptic patients. Vitamin D participates in neuroprotection, brain cell proliferation, and differentiation. Consequently, vitamin D supplementation has been suggested as an alternative treatment in epileptic patients. We aimed at assessment of vitamin D signaling pathway in epileptic patients. 

In the present study, we evaluated vitamin D serum concentration as well as expression of *vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene and 

* genes encoding for 

   * vitamin D activating enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and 

   * deactivating enzyme 24-hyroxylase (CYP24A1)

in epileptic patients compared with healthy individuals. 

We found significant lower levels of vitamin D in epileptic patients compared with healthy subjects. Expression analyses showed significant downregulation of VDR expression in peripheral blood of epileptic patients compared with healthy subjects (relative expression (REx) = 0.16, P < 0.001). 

However, there was no significant difference in CYP24A1 expression between epileptic patients and normal subjects. 

CYP27B1 expression analysis showed significant upregulation in male patients aged between 30 and 40 (REx = 5.43, P = 0.013). After using two-way ANCOVA for adjusting the effects of sex and age, there was a  **statistically significant difference in the VDR expression values between patient and control groups**  (P < 0.001). 

Spearman's correlation analysis showed no significant correlation between genes expression levels and patients' age or vitamin D serum concentrations. 

However, we found significant correlations between VDR expression levels and CYP24A1/ CYP27B1 expression levels in epileptic patients (r = 0.435 and P < 0.001; r = 0.26 and P = 0.02 respectively). 

There was also a significant correlation between the expression levels of CYP24A1 and CYP27B1 (r = 0.349 and P = 0.001). Our study shows a possible role for VDR in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
