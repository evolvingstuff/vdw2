I notice that many seniors now take baby aspirin daily to with the expectation of preventing a variety of diseases. 

I wanted to see if there was anything which we could use about aspirin to promote vitamin D.

#### Possible lessons to be learned from Aspirin

* Aspirin is a pill ==> perhaps describe vitamin D as being a pill, not a supplement

* Aspirin is considered to be safe, but vitamin D is far safer

   * Overdose is about 100 of baby aspirin, Vitamin D overdose is about 10,000 pills 

   * You only need tiny amount of Vitamin D: 1/10  that you would get from a day of sunbathing

* Vitamin D has been used by humans for at least [100X longer than aspirin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_aspirin)

* 80 xx of aspirin seems much smaller than 2000 xx of vitamin D

   * But the aspirin weighs 1,600X more than the  Vitamin D

#### How Vitamin D is better than Baby Aspirin

V!itamin D is extremely low-cost, like aspirin

Vitamin D is also over-the-counter

Vitamin D has far fewer side effects  (aspirin is the primary cause of bleeding stomachs)

Vitamin D provides 3X-100X more benefits than aspirin (Cancer, Heart Attack, Stroke, etc)

Vitamin D deals with about 10X more health problems than aspirin

Vitamin D helps people of all ages and sexes – vs aspirin primarily helps mature/senior males

Vitamin D has far more and better proof than aspirin

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the way, the initial study which found a heart benefit from aspirin has not been replicated, though they have tried many times. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The initial trial had used Bufferin, which contains Magnesium - which may have been cause of improved heart health.

Vitamin D can also relieve some pain – but it takes longer

Vitamin D is better than baby aspirin in that it can be taken weekly or monthly, instead of daily

Vitamin D is better than baby aspirin in that people can feel the benefits in months, instead of possibly noticing a benefit in decades

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Will feel the benefit in weeks if use a loading dose.

#### I cannot imagine how Vitamin D could use the following, but. . .

* Various doctors around the world get pay-for-performance increases for each patient they get to take baby aspirin.

* Most medical associations still encourage baby aspirin, just like they still encourage low cholesterol, even though both have been proven to be incorrect during the past decade.
