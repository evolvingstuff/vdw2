 **Possible Mechanisms** 

1. Pesticides reduce Vitamin D, which increase the rate of each disease

1. Pesticides increase the rate of each disease, and Vitamin D is consumed in dealing with the inflammation, etc.

Pesticides are a family of compounds which have brought many benefits to mankind in the agricultural, industrial, and health areas, but their toxicities in both humans and animals have always been a concern. Regardless of acute poisonings which are common for some classes of pesticides like organophosphoruses, the association of chronic and sub-lethal exposure to pesticides with a prevalence of some persistent diseases is going to be a phenomenon to which global attention has been attracted. In this review, incidence of various malignant, neurodegenerative, respiratory, reproductive, developmental, and metabolic diseases in relation to different routes of human exposure to pesticides such as occupational, environmental, residential, parental, maternal, and paternal has been systematically criticized in different categories of pesticide toxicities like carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and metabolic toxicity. 

A huge body of evidence exists on the possible role of pesticide exposures in the elevated incidence of human diseases such as 

* cancers, 

* Alzheimer, 

* Parkinson, 

* amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 

* asthma, 

* bronchitis, 

* infertility, 

* birth defects, 

* attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 

* autism, 

* diabetes, and 

* obesity. 

Most of the disorders are induced by insecticides and herbicides most notably organophosphorus, organochlorines, phenoxyacetic acids, and triazine compounds.

#### Organophosphate exposures during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment - PLOS Oct 2018   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Recommendations for essential policy reforms

* "In one review, adverse effects of OP pesticide exposure on neurodevelopment were seen in all but one of the 27 studies evaluated; the strongest associations occurred following prenatal exposures"

* "Outcomes associated with OP pesticide exposure to the fetus include abnormal primitive reflexes in newborns; mental and motor delays among preschoolers; and decreases in working and visual memory, processing speed, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and IQ among elementary school–age children. Prenatal exposures also elevated risks for symptoms or diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)"
