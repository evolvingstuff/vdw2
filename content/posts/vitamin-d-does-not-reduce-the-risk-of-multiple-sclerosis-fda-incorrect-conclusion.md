**[FDA Denies Health Claim for Vitamin D to Prevent MS](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/891307?src=rss) Jan 2018** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **The Bayer Corporation petitioned the FDA to make the following claim** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  **<span style="color:#00F;">“Vitamin D may reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS).”</span>** 

&nbsp; &nbsp;  **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fda-ms-detailed-response.pdf">Download the FDA response from VitaminDWiki</a>** 

 **7 studies (see below) have found a ~2X less risk of Multiple Sclerosis for people with higher vitamin D levels** 

 **VitaminDWiki believes the claim that <span style="color:#00F;">“Vitamin D may reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS).”</span> is valid**

#### FDA looked at only two observational studies

 **that evaluated the association between serum vitamin D levels and MS risk** 

 **Strangely the FDA did not consider that the studies found any benefit** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">These 2 studies (and 5 others below) found:  Higher Vitamin D ==> about a 2X decreased risk of MS</span>** 

 **Munger et al., 2017** 

* 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and risk of MS among women in the Finnish Maternity Cohort

* Which is in VitaminDWiki  **[Multiple Sclerosis risk a decade later was 2X higher if low vitamin D (12 ng vs 20 ng) – Sept 2017](/posts/multiple-sclerosis-risk-a-decade-later-was-2x-higher-if-low-vitamin-d-12-ng-vs-20-ng)** 

 **Nielsen et al., 2017**  Munger = coauthor

* Neonatal vitamin D status and risk of multiple sclerosis 

* Which is in VitaminDWiki  **[Multiple Sclerosis risk reduced 30 percent by each additional 10 ng of vitamin D at birth (1500 Danes) – Jan 2017](/posts/multiple-sclerosis-risk-reduced-30-percent-by-each-additional-10-ng-of-vitamin-d-at-birth-1500-danes)**

> Munger observational study was not commented on by the FDA response

> Perhaps because the Vitamin D was part of a multi-vitamin, and the reduced MS might have been due to some other ingredient

> Note: The 2004 study commented on this possibility, and stated that future studies were to be based on Vitamin D levels, which the FDA later rejected

> Munger observational study perhaps discarded by FDA because it used Vitamin D levels, not vitamin D intake

 **The FDA seems to ignore the fact that a person can increase their Vitamin D blood levels with Vitamin D supplements**

#### The FDA did look at some small TREATMENT studies of MS with Vitamin D

 **Wonder why did the FDA looked at treatment studies to make a statement about prevention** 

* None of the studies were large enough to show statistical significance (typically fewer than 40 people)

* None of the studies used even a fraction of what is needed to “cure” multiple sclerosis

 **Burton et al., 2010** 

* A phase I/11 dose-escalation trial of vitamin D3 and calcium in multiple sclerosis

* Small trial did not have enough patients (25) to result in statistical significance

* But, every one of the trends indicated decreased of MS with 10,000 to 14,000 U of vitamin D, even though they had Calcium supplements

 **Derakhshandi et al., 2013;** 

* Preventive effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on conversion of optic neuritis to clinically definite multiple sclerosis

* “50,000 IU of vitamin D3 weekly for 12 months” to 15 patients

* “Risk reduction was 68.4 % for the primary outcome in the treatment group”

 **Kampmen et al., 2012;** 

* Effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on relapses, disease progression

* “20,000 IU vitamin D(3) weekly” 25 patients

* The 10% risk reduction found after a year was not statistically significant

 **Kimball etal., 2011;  only helped those who got above 40 ng of Vitamin D** 

* Cholecalciferol plus calcium suppresses abnormal PBMC reactivity in patients with multiple sclerosis.

* “MS-associated, abnormal T cell reactivities were suppressed in vivo by cholecalciferol at serum 25(OH)D concentrations higher than 100 nmol/liter”

 **Soilu-Hanninen et al., 2012;** 

* A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with vitamin D3 as an add on treatment to interferon

* Those getting Vitamin D had 

> 1) Decreased burden of disease, 

> 2) fewer new T2 lesions,  

> 3) significantly lower number of T1 enhancing lesions, 

> 4) Tendency to reduced disability accumulation, 

> 5) improved timed tandem walk

 **Sotirchos et al., 2016;** 

* Safety and immunologic effects of high-vs low-dose cholecalciferol in multiple sclerosis

* Only 20 Msers, “10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable . . “ 

* Vitamin D also improved all MS bio-markers, but only a few were statistically significant for this low of dose and so few participants

 **Stein et al., 2011** 

* A randomized trial of high-dose vitamin  **D2**  in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis

* 7,000 IU in a study of only 25 patients with a very poor form of Vitamin D

#### The FDA decided to ignore all meta-analyses of Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis

#### VitaminDWiki believes that <span style="color:#00F;">“Vitamin D may treat multiple sclerosis”</span> would also be a valid claim

 **An example study which supports this claim** 

* [Multiple Sclerosis Relapsing-Remitting rate reduced 30 percent by addition of 14,000 IU vitamin D daily – RCT Nov 2016](/posts/multiple-sclerosis-relapsing-remitting-rate-reduced-30-percent-by-addition-of-14-min-d-daily-rct)
