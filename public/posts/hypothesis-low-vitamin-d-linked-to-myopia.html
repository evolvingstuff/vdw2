Epub 2007 Sep 4. Prepas SB.</p><p>Eye Physician and Surgeon, Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, 360 San Miguel Dr. #407, Newport Beach, CA 92651, United States. <a href=mailto:sbprepas@sbcglobal.net>sbprepas@sbcglobal.net</a></p><p>As the prevalence of myopia steadily increases, reaching as high as 90% in some populations, investigators continue to look for causative factors other than family history. Most current research suggests an association of axial myopia with reading or either the presence or absence of light. Even though these studies are frequently inconsistent, non-reproducible or contradictory, many clinicians utilize them in recommending treatments for children, such as bifocals or atropine. By reviewing the biologic effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic fields, we may gain insight into these discrepancies as well as unify the combined role of literacy and light in the pathogenesis of myopia. These biologic effects are wavelength specific. The wavelength of artificial (either incandescent or fluorescent) light is primarily 700-400 nm, while the wavelength of natural light is 700-200 nm, inclusive of the ultraviolet spectrum. So the opposite findings of myopia resulting from either accommodation under continuous light or under darkness (form deprivation) can be reconciled by restating it: Close focusing in the absence of UV light may provoke axial myopia. Experimental evidence exhibiting both scleral remodeling under accommodation as well as the inhibition of scleral remodeling by the hardening of collagen under ultraviolet exposure may support this concept. Perhaps new research can look into the role of the presence or absence of UV light in animal models of myopia.

Guggenheim, PhD</p><p>Received 14 July 2008; received in revised form 7 October 2008; accepted 7 October 2008. published online 20 January 2009.</p><p>Purpose: Mandel et al recently reported that season of birth and daylight hours (photoperiod) at birth were associated with moderate and high levels of myopia in Israeli conscripts. We sought to investigate whether these associations were evident in subjects from the United Kingdom (UK).</p><p>Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.</p><p>Participants: The study population comprised 74,459 subjects aged 18 to 100 years attending UK optometry practices for an eye examination.</p><p>Methods: Data comprising non-cycloplegic spectacle prescription, sex, date of birth, and date of eye examination were collected from UK optometry practices. The average refractive error in fellow eyes was used to classify the degree of myopia in diopters (D) for each subject as follows: absent (>?0.75 D), low (?0.75 to ?2.99 D), moderate (?3.00 to ?5.99 D), or high (&lt;?6.00 D). The average monthly hours of daylight for London, UK, were classified into 1 of 4 “photoperiod categories,” following Mandel et al. The odds ratio (OR) for each level of severity of myopia was calculated using multivariate logistic regression with age, sex, and either season of birth or photoperiod category as risk factors.</p><p>Main Outcome Measures: The OR for season of birth and photoperiod category as potential risk factors for myopia.</p><p>Results: <strong>Season of birth was significantly associated with the presence of high myopia</strong> : Subjects born in summer or autumn were more likely to be highly myopic compared with those born in winter (summer OR = 1.17; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 1.05–1.30; P = 0.006; autumn OR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04–1.30; P = 0.007). However, season of birth was not a significant risk factor for low or moderate myopia. Photoperiod category was weakly associated with low myopia (OR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99; P = 0.019), but with a direction of effect opposite to that observed by Mandel et al.</p><p>Conclusions: As in Israel, a disproportionate number of UK high myopes were born in summer or autumn rather than in winter.</p><p>However, unlike the situation in Israel, this association does not seem to be related to daylight hours during the postnatal period,</p><p>implicating alternative physiologic influences that vary with season, such as birth weight.</p><hr><h3 id=worst-myopia-if-born-in-june--poland---2015>Worst Myopia if born in June (Poland) - 2015</h3><p><strong>Does the month of birth influence the prevalence of refractive errors?</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/myopia-worse-if-born-in-june.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=nearsightedness-increasing-in-ushttpwwwwiredcomwiredscience200912nearsightedness-increasing-wired-magazine-dec-2009><a href=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/12/nearsightedness-increasing/>Nearsightedness Increasing in U.S.</a> Wired Magazine Dec 2009</h3><ul><li><p>25% in 1970&rsquo;s 42% 3 decades later = <span style=color:#f33>1.7X increase</span></p></li><li><p>moderate nearsightedness doubling between the two time periods =<span style=color:#f33>2.0X increase</span></p></li><li><p>blacks: 13 to 34 percent over the three-decade span = <strong><span style=color:#f33>2.6X increase</span></strong></p></li></ul><hr><h3 id=sunny-treatment-for-diseases-updates-on-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-sufficiencyhttpraquelbillioneshealthevacom20080408sunny-treatment-for-diseases-updates-on-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-sufficiency-pharmed-news><a href=http://raquelbilliones.healtheva.com/2008/04/08/sunny-treatment-for-diseases-updates-on-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-sufficiency/>Sunny treatment for diseases: updates on vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency</a> PharMed News</h3><p>Vitamin D deficiency is linked to myopia in the Asia-Pacific region.
