#### Hydrogel encapsulation of vitamin D delays release in intestines – Sept 2018

 **Development of Hydrogels for Entrapment of Vitamin D3: Physicochemical Characterization and Release Study** 

Food Biophysics. Sept 2018, Vol 13, Issue 3, pp 284–291, DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/s11483-018-9534-7

Study does not appear to state when a delayed release is wanted

&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps want microbiome in colon to get more Vitamin D

Study does not compare the use of hydrogels to various emulsions

 **Release time in acidic environment**
