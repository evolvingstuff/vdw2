#### What % of people dislike swallowing pills and why â€“ Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024

> &nbsp; even though they do not have issues swallowing food or liquids.

There are several reasons why people may dislike or have difficulty swallowing pills:

* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - acid backing up into the esophagus may cause damage leading to spasms or narrowing

* Scleroderma - scar-like tissue buildup that can weaken the lower esophageal ring

* Radiation therapy - head and neck cancer treatment can cause swallowing disorders even years later

* Dry mouth

* Temporary conditions like taking antibiotics or undergoing chemotherapy
