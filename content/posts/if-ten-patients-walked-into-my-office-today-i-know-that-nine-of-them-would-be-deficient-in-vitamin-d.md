### [Why I Take Vitamin D3 in the Summer](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/759172-why-i-take-vitamin-d3-in-the-summer/)  Dr. Junger

 **First portion of blog post follows** 

If ten patients walked into my office today, I know that nine of them would be deficient in vitamin D.

 **So when a patient recently asked me if they needed to supplement with vitamin D3 in the summer, my answer was, ”Yes.”** 

It may seem strange but most of us, even in summer, rarely get enough direct sunlight on a regular basis. 

Many of us work in offices and spend most of our days indoors year-round.

Even if we take a week vacation where we are exposed to more sun than usual, this is rarely enough to offset common deficiencies. 

And when we are deficient, our health suffers.

I recommend that you aim to get your ng/ml above 50, preferably between 50 and 60.
