#### Effect of epigenetics on vitamin D levels: a systematic review until December 2020

Arch Public Health. 2023 Jun 15;81(1):106. [doi: 10.1186/s13690-023-01122-2.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-023-01122-2.)

Background: The association between epigenetic modification of the genes involved in the vitamin D metabolic pathway and vitamin D metabolites' status has been elucidated incompletely. This study aims to review the studies on the mentioned association and create a brighter view of this topic.

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline database (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science up to the end of November 2020. Original articles which reported the effect of epigenetic alteration-methylation level or its changes-of genes involved in vitamin D regulation on the vitamin D metabolites serum level or its changes were included. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) checklist was used to assess the quality of included articles.

Results: Among 2566 records, nine reports were included in the systematic review according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies discussed the contribution of methylation status of members of the 

* cytochrome P450 family (CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1), and 

* Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) genes to vitamin D level variance. 

CYP2R1 methylation status could regulate the contributing factors affecting the vitamin D serum level and predict response to vitamin D supplementation. Studies revealed that impaired methylation of CYP24A1 occurs in response to an increase in serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). It is reported that the association between methylation levels of CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and VDR genes and 25(OH)D level is not affected by the methyl-donors bioavailability.

Conclusions: The epigenetic modification of the vitamin D-related genes could explain the vitamin D levels variation among populations. Large-scale clinical trials in various ethnicities are suggested to find the effect of epigenetics on vitamin D response variation.

Registration: The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42022306327).
