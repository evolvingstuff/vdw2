&lt;img src=&quot;https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/venn-methylation.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;

Purpose: To investigate the association between DNA methylation and childhood simple obesity.

Methods: Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was conducted on peripheral blood samples from 41 children with simple obesity and 31 normal controls to identify differentially methylated sites (DMS). Subsequently, gene functional analysis of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) was carried out. After screening the characteristic DMGs based on specific conditions, the methylated levels of these DMS were evaluated and verified by pyrosequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the predictive efficacy of corresponding DMGs. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis revealed the correlation between specific DMS and clinical data.

Results: The overall DNA methylation level in the obesity group was significantly lower than in normal. A total of 241 DMS were identified. 

Functional pathway analysis revealed that DMGs were primarily involved in 

* lipid metabolism, 

* carbohydrate metabolism, 

* amino acid metabolism, 

* human diseases, among other pathways. 

The characteristic DMS within the genes Transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM) and Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1(PIEZO1) were recognized as CpG-cg05831083 and CpG-cg14926485, respectively. Furthermore, the methylation level of CpG-cg05831083 significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) and vitamin D.

Conclusions: Abnormal DNA methylation is closely related to childhood simple obesity. The altered methylation of CpG-cg05831083 and CpG-cg14926485 could potentially serve as biomarkers for childhood simple obesity.

Obesity is strongly associated with disturbances of vitamin D (VD) metabolites in the animal models. However, the related epidemiological evidence is still controversial, especially the different degrees of obesity. Hence, in this present representative cross-sectional study, 106 obesity school-age children aged 7-12 years were included and divided into different subgroups as degree I (the age- and sex-specific BMI≥95th percentile, n=45), II (BMI ≥120% percentile, n=34) and III (BMI ≥140% percentile, n=27) obesity groups across the ranges of body mass index (BMI).. While the age- and sex-matched subjects without obesity were as the control group. Notably, it was significantly different of body composition, anthropological and clinical characteristics among the above four subgroups with the dose-response relationships (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, comparing with the control group, the serum VD concentrations were higher, VD metabolites like 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D, and related hydroxylases as CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 were lower in the degree I, II and III obesity subgroups (P&lt;0.05), which were more disorder with the anthropological and clinical characteristics as the obesity was worsen in a BMI-independent manner (P&lt;0.05). 

However, there was a significant increase of CYP27B1 in the degree III obesity group than those in the degree I and II obesity subgroups. Furthermore, the methylation patterns on the genome-wide (Methylation/Hydroxymethylation) and VD metabolism genes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) were negatively correlated with the worse obesity and their related expressions (P&lt;0.05). In summary, these results indicated that obesity could affect the homeostasis of VD metabolism related genes such as CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and etc through abnormal DNA methylation, resulting in the disorders of VD related metabolites to decrease VD bio-availability with the BMI-independent manner. In turn, the lower levels of VD metabolites would affect the liver function to exacerbate the progression of obesity, as the Degree II and III obesity subgroups.

Furthermore, the methylation patterns on the genome-wide (Methylation/Hydroxymethylation) and VD metabolism genes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) were negatively correlated with the worse obesity and their related expressions (P&lt;0.05). In summary, these results indicated that obesity could affect the homeostasis of VD metabolism related genes such as CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and etc through abnormal DNA methylation, resulting in the disorders of VD related metabolites to decrease VD bio-availability with the BMI-independent manner. In turn, the lower levels of VD metabolites would affect the liver function to exacerbate the progression of obesity, as the Degree II and III obesity subgroups.\n\n`

However, the related epidemiological evidence is still controversial, especially the different degrees of obesity. Hence, in this present representative cross-sectional study, 106 obesity school-age children aged 7-12 years were included and divided into different subgroups as degree I (the age- and sex-specific BMI≥95th percentile, n=45), II (BMI ≥120% percentile, n=34) and III (BMI ≥140% percentile, n=27) obesity groups across the ranges of body mass index (BMI).. While the age- and sex-matched subjects without obesity were as the control group. Notably, it was significantly different of body composition, anthropological and clinical characteristics among the above four subgroups with the dose-response relationships (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, comparing with the control group, the serum VD concentrations were higher, VD metabolites like 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D, and related hydroxylases as CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 were lower in the degree I, II and III obesity subgroups (P&lt;0.05), which were more disorder with the anthropological and clinical characteristics as the obesity was worsen in a BMI-independent manner (P&lt;0.05). \nHowever, there was a significant increase of CYP27B1 in the degree III obesity group than those in the degree I and II obesity subgroups. Furthermore, the methylation patterns on the genome-wide (Methylation/Hydroxymethylation) and VD metabolism genes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) were negatively correlated with the worse obesity and their related expressions (P&lt;0.05). In summary, these results indicated that obesity could affect the homeostasis of VD metabolism related genes such as CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and etc through abnormal DNA methylation, resulting in the disorders of VD related metabolites to decrease VD bio-availability with the BMI-independent manner.

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21003&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;}
Purpose: To investigate the association between DNA methylation and childhood simple obesity.

Methods: Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was conducted on peripheral blood samples from 41 children with simple obesity and 31 normal controls to identify differentially methylated sites (DMS). Subsequently, gene functional analysis of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) was carried out. After screening the characteristic DMGs based on specific conditions, the methylated levels of these DMS were evaluated and verified by pyrosequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the predictive efficacy of corresponding DMGs. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis revealed the correlation between specific DMS and clinical data.

Results: The overall DNA methylation level in the obesity group was significantly lower than in normal. A total of 241 DMS were identified. 
Functional pathway analysis revealed that DMGs were primarily involved in 
*lipid metabolism, 
*carbohydrate metabolism, 
*amino acid metabolism, 
*human diseases, among other pathways. 
The characteristic DMS within the genes Transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM) and Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1(PIEZO1) were recognized as CpG-cg05831083 and CpG-cg14926485, respectively. Furthermore, the methylation level of CpG-cg05831083 significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) and vitamin D.

Conclusions: Abnormal DNA methylation is closely related to childhood simple obesity. The altered methylation of CpG-cg05831083 and CpG-cg14926485 could potentially serve as biomarkers for childhood simple obesity.

Obesity is strongly associated with disturbances of vitamin D (VD) metabolites in the animal models. However, the related epidemiological evidence is still controversial, especially the different degrees of obesity. Hence, in this present representative cross-sectional study, 106 obesity school-age children aged 7-12 years were included and divided into different subgroups as degree I (the age- and sex-specific BMI≥95th percentile, n=45), II (BMI ≥120% percentile, n=34) and III (BMI ≥140% percentile, n=27) obesity groups across the ranges of body mass index (BMI).. While the age- and sex-matched subjects without obesity were as the control group. Notably, it was significantly different of body composition, anthropological and clinical characteristics among the above four subgroups with the dose-response relationships (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, comparing with the control group, the serum VD concentrations were higher, VD metabolites like 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D, and related hydroxylases as CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 were lower in the degree I, II and III obesity subgroups (P&lt;0.05), which were more disorder with the anthropological and clinical characteristics as the obesity was worsen in a BMI-independent manner (P&lt;0.05). 
However, there was a significant increase of CYP27B1 in the degree III obesity group than those in the degree I and II obesity subgroups. Furthermore, the methylation patterns on the genome-wide (Methylation/Hydroxymethylation) and VD metabolism genes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) were negatively correlated with the worse obesity and their related expressions (P&lt;0.05). In summary, these results indicated that obesity could affect the homeostasis of VD metabolism related genes such as CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and etc through abnormal DNA methylation, resulting in the disorders of VD related metabolites to decrease VD bio-availability with the BMI-independent manner. In turn, the lower levels of VD metabolites would affect the liver function to exacerbate the progression of obesity, as the Degree II and III obesity subgroups.
