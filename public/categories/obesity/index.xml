Experimental studies suggest that vitamin D modulates the activity of adipocytes. The authors examined baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in relation to prevalent and cumulative incident obesity in Norway. A cohort of 25,616 adults aged 19-55 years participated in both the second and third surveys of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 2 (1995-1997) and HUNT 3 (2006-2008)). Serum 25(OH)D levels measured at baseline and anthropometric measurements taken at both baseline and follow-up were available for a random sample of 2,460 subjects. Overall, 40% of the 2,460 subjects had a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L, and 37% had a level of 50.0-74.9 nmol/L. The prevalence and cumulative incidence of obesity, defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) ?30, were 12% and 15%, respectively. Lower serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a higher prevalence of obesity. 

In the 2,165 subjects with baseline BMI less than 30, a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L was associated with a significantly increased odds ratio for incident obesity during follow-up (adjusted odds ratio = __1.73__, 95% confidence interval: 1.24, 2.41). 

When prevalent and incident obesity were classified according to waist circumference (?88 cm for women, ?102 cm for men), similar results were obtained. In addition to prevalent obesity, a serum 25(OH)D level less than 50.0 nmol/L was significantly associated with new-onset obesity in adults.

&lt;p>Evidence of the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and cardiovascular risk factors in children is limited.

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is a serious global issue. Although the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> test is generally the most accurate way to assess vitamin D levels, the optimal range of 25(OH)D has yet to be established. Moreover, the optimal level may vary according to race, region, and age. Suboptimal vitamin D status is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are the major risk factors for cardiovascular disorders; however, these relationships in children and adolescents have yet to be clearly determined. Therefore, we identified the best predictive cut-off value for reflecting abdominal obesity and, based on this value, we investigated the relationship between suboptimal 25(OH)D status and the risk for having abdominal obesity, being overweight or obese, and having metabolic syndrome in Korean adolescents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bariatric surgery less than 30 ng of vitamin D – 82 pcnt teens, 100 pcnt of black teens</title><link>/posts/bariatric-surgery-less-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-82-pcnt-teens-100-pcnt-of-black-teens.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/bariatric-surgery-less-than-30-ng-of-vitamin-d-82-pcnt-teens-100-pcnt-of-black-teens.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="check-vitamin-d-in-adolescents-before-bariatric-surgeryhttpwwwfamilypracticenewscomnewsmore-top-newssingle-viewcheck-vitamin-d-in-adolescents-before-bariatric-surgery9fe0deca25b9ee123ab565b28f2d1a9ehtml20-family-practice-news">&lt;a href="http://www.familypracticenews.com/news/more-top-news/single-view/check-vitamin-d-in-adolescents-before-bariatric-surgery/9fe0deca25b9ee123ab565b28f2d1a9e.html%20">Check Vitamin D in Adolescents Before Bariatric Surgery&lt;/a> Family Practice News&lt;/h4>
