Background: Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease characterized by bacterial-dysbiosis-associated, host-mediated inflammation, which results in the loss of the tooth-supporting tissues. Vitamin D3 plays an important role in the tissue homeostasis and its deficiency might have a negative effect on the periodontitis progression and treatment outcomes. 

Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the vitamin D3 serum levels among patients with periodontitis and healthy subjects. Materials and 

Methods: A total of 100 generally healthy adult participants (50 diagnosed with periodontitis, 50 with healthy periodontium) were enrolled in the study. The periodontal clinical parameters were measured, radiographs were performed and the 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) test was used to assess vitamin D3 levels. 

Results: Vitamin D3 levels were found to be statistically significantly lower among periodontitis patients (31.34; SD = 5.62) compared with healthy controls (39.64; SD = 8.77). Vitamin D3 deficiency was corresponding to the stage and grade of the disease as well as the clinical attachment and bone loss. 

Conclusion: Adequate monitoring of the vitamin D3 serum levels and supplementation could be of benefit in periodontitis treatment.
