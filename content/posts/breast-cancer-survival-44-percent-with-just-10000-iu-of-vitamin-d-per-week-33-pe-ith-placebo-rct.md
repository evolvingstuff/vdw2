#### Efficacy of nutritional intervention in breast cancer patients: a randomized clinical case control trial

This study aimed to assess the effects of nutritional intervention in breast cancer patients. Anthropometrics serum biomarkers and tumor markers were assessed in breast cancer female patients. Product intervention was done in the breast cancer group (n = 120) which was further segregated into three treatments groups T0 placebo Group (non-supplemented cookies) + che­motherapy, T1 synthetic group (vitamin D and calcium supplement) + che­motherapy, T2 natural group (ESP + CLO supplemented cookies) + chemotherapy. Anthropometrics data showed that body mass index (BMI) and hand grip strength (kg) were varied from 26.48 ± 0.28 to 26.15 ± 0.20 kg/ m2 and 22.18 ± 0.36 to 22.21 ± 0.38 kg among T2 group, respectively. After intervention of natural supplement, serum calcium and serum vitamin D levels were significantly improved from 8.45 ± 0.08 to 8.61 ± 0.11 mg/dl and 26.45 ± 0.84 to 30.33 ± 1.37 ng/ml among T2 participants, respectively. Whereas in T1 group the serum calcium slightly improved from 8.46 ± 0.06 to 8.53 ± 0.07 mg/dl and serum vitamin D levels enhanced from 24.18 ± 1.06 to 26.38 ± 1.05 ng/ml among participants. The serum parathyroid hormone level significantly decreased from 5.2 ± 0.07 to 4.9 ± 0.07 pmol/l in T2 group participants. The nutritional intervention of calcium and vitamin D had shown to improved body mass index (BMI), hand grip strength and increased oral intake in patients and reduced inflammatory markers.

##### Study observations by VitaminDWiki

* Vitamin D was given for only 13 weeks

* Reached an average D level of just 30 ng

* Survival was assesed at 200 weeks

* the Vitamin D and placebo women both got chemotherapy

* "Pakistan has a 10-year younger average age for breast cancer diagnoses in females than other developed nations."

##### Would have had far more survivors with:

* Loading dose of 300,000 IU in the first week

* weekly dose of 50,000 IU (instead of 10,000 IU)

* continue the dosing thru the 200 weeks

* added and activator for the Vitamin D Receptor (which gets more vitamin D to the cells)

  * Breast Cancer appears to protect itself by deactivating the Vitamin D Receptor

1. Monitor the white blood cell count during chemo + Vitamin D and reduce the dose if blood cells unusally decrease

!!!!Efficacy of nutritional intervention in breast cancer patients: a randomized clinical case control trial

This study aimed to assess the effects of nutritional intervention in breast cancer patients. Anthropometrics serum biomarkers and tumor markers were assessed in breast cancer female patients. Product intervention was done in the breast cancer group (n = 120) which was further segregated into three treatments groups T0 placebo Group (non-supplemented cookies) + che­motherapy, T1 synthetic group (vitamin D and calcium supplement) + che­motherapy, T2 natural group (ESP + CLO supplemented cookies) + chemotherapy. Anthropometrics data showed that body mass index (BMI) and hand grip strength (kg) were varied from 26.48 ± 0.28 to 26.15 ± 0.20 kg/ m2 and 22.18 ± 0.36 to 22.21 ± 0.38 kg among T2 group, respectively. After intervention of natural supplement, serum calcium and serum vitamin D levels were significantly improved from 8.45 ± 0.08 to 8.61 ± 0.11 mg/dl and 26.45 ± 0.84 to 30.33 ± 1.37 ng/ml among T2 participants, respectively. Whereas in T1 group the serum calcium slightly improved from 8.46 ± 0.06 to 8.53 ± 0.07 mg/dl and serum vitamin D levels enhanced from 24.18 ± 1.06 to 26.38 ± 1.05 ng/ml among participants. The serum parathyroid hormone level significantly decreased from 5.2 ± 0.07 to 4.9 ± 0.07 pmol/l in T2 group participants. The nutritional intervention of calcium and vitamin D had shown to improved body mass index (BMI), hand grip strength and increased oral intake in patients and reduced inflammatory markers.

!!!!!Study observations by VitaminDWiki
*Vitamin D was given for only 13 weeks
*Reached an average D level of just 30 ng
*Survival was assesed at 200 weeks
*the Vitamin D and placebo women both got chemotherapy
*&quot;Pakistan has a 10-year younger average age for breast cancer diagnoses in females than other developed nations.&quot;
!!!!!Would have had far more survivors with:
*Loading dose of 300,000 IU in the first week
*weekly dose of 50,000 IU (instead of 10,000 IU)
*continue the dosing thru the 200 weeks
*added and activator for the Vitamin D Receptor (which gets more vitamin D to the cells)
**&#39;&#39;Breast Cancer appears to protect itself by deactivating the Vitamin D Receptor&#39;&#39;
!!!!!~~#F06:Warning: Vitamin D amplifies the killing power of about half of the chemos~~
Using ((Chemotherapy might be amplified by vitamin D|high dose vitamin D with chemo therapy)) requires one of the following to avoid death
#Select a chemo with an effectiveness that is not increased by Vitamin D
#Have the chemo doctor decrease the dosage before starting
#Monitor the white blood cell count during chemo + Vitamin D and reduce the dose if blood cells unusally decrease
