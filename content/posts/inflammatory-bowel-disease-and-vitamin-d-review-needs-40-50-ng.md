* This overviews a variety of types of IBD and Vitamin D studies

* IBD Studies giving a fixed amount of vitamin D have not been consistently successful

* Small, short IBD studies which has the goal of getting Vitamin D in the range of 40 to 50 ng have been successful.

* Many non-IBD studies with similar goals have likewise been successful

* No mention appears to be made of the importance of a gut-friendly form of Vitamin D for IBD, Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis and other health problems associated with poor guts

* There appears to be no mention of the variety of non-gut methods of increasing vitamin D levels (see chart below)
