### Quick estimate of cost to prevent some/many/most/all Zika birth defects

* 400 million people live in Zika affected countries

* 4 million pregnancies in those countries (10 pregancies annually per 1,000 population)

* 1 million of those pregnancies will be near Zika infected regions (1 in 4) 

* $10 pays for enough vitamin D for an entire pregnancy

*  **$10 million per year**
