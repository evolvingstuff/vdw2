#### Effect of Calcifediol Treatment and best Available Therapy versus best Available Therapy on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID- 19: A Pilot Randomized Clinical study

 **Dr. Grant's summary of the trial** 

The results of treatment of COVID-19 patients in Spain with calcifediol were announced on August 29. (Calcifediol <span>[25(OH)D]</span> is often used in Spain. They state that the conversion factor for calcifediol is  **3.2 times** the same mass as cholecalciferol  Thus, the 0.532 mg of calcifediol is equivalent to 64,240 IU of cholecalciferol.) The mean age of the patients was 53±10 years. None of the prognostic factors evaluated except previous high blood pressure (15 without treatment, 11 with treatment) significantly affected the outcome. In this study, 50 patients were given soft capsules of 0.532 mg calcifediol on the day of admission, then on day 3 and seven, then weekly until discharge or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Forty nine of the caldifediol-treated patients did not require the ICU, while 13 of the 26 not receiving that treatment did require the ICU. While this was a pilot RCT, it provides strong evidence that vitamin D treatment can reduce the risk of adverse COVID-19 outcome.

"Calcifediol is also 3.2-fold more effective than native vitamin D3 supplements in restoring low blood levels of vitamin D3. Because normal vitamin D3 needs to undergo liver processing first, which is not required for calcifediol. Another perk of calcifediol is its  **higher intestinal absorption rate** ."

   * Note by VitaminDWiki: nanoemulsion Vitamin D appears to also have a high absorption rate, and can be applied topically or inside the mouth for very fast absorption without the use of the intestine
