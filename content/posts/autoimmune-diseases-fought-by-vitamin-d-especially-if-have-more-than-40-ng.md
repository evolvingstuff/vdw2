Vitamin D intervenes in calcium and phosphate metabolism and bone homeostasis. Experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) generates immunologic activities on the innate and adaptive immune system and endothelial membrane stability. Low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are associated with an increased risk of developing immune-related diseases such as psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune diseases. Various clinical trials describe the efficacy of supplementation of vitamin D and its metabolites for treating these diseases that result in variable outcomes. Different disease outcomes are observed in treatment with vitamin D as high inter-individual difference is present with complex gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, it is still not fully known what level of serum 25(OH)D is needed. The current recommendation is to increase vitamin D intake and have enough sunlight exposure to have serum 25(OH)D at a level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and  **better at 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to obtain the optimal health benefits of vitamin D.**
