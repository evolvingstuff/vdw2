* 1.	As sun exposure in the U.S. has DECREASED by 90% during the last century, melanoma incidence has INCREASED BY 3,000%.

* 2.	A 20-year Swedish study shows that sun avoidance is as bad for the health as cigarette smoking.

* 3.	A Spanish study shows that women who seek the sun have one-eleventh the hip fracture risk as those who avoid sun.

* 4.	Men who work outdoors have half the risk of melanoma as those who work indoors.

* 5.	Women who totally avoid the sun have 10-times the risk of breast cancer.

* 6.	Women who sunbathe regularly have half the risk of death during a 20-year period compared to those who stay indoors.

* 7.	Sun exposure increases nitric oxide production, which leads to a decrease in heart attack risk.

* 8.	Vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin, is essential to human survival, and sun exposure is the only natural way to obtain it. 

> &nbsp; &nbsp;Sunbathing can produce 20,000 units of vitamin D in 20 minutes of whole-body exposure.

* 9.	Sun exposure dramatically improves mood through the production of serotonin and endorphin.

* 10.Beyond vitamin D, sun exposure also stimulates the production of endorphin, nitric oxide and BDNF, all of which are vital to human health.

* 11.Regular sun exposure also reduces high blood pressure, heart disease, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis (MS).

* 12.As sunscreen use has increased dramatically, melanoma has increased exponentially.
