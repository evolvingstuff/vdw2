The relationship between vitamin D and the vagus nerve, a critical component of the autonomic nervous system, has been explored in various studies, suggesting that vitamin D may indeed play a role in supporting vagus nerve function and, by extension, autonomic nervous system health.

 **Vitamin D and Autonomic Nervous System** 

Vitamin D is traditionally known for its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, but emerging research has highlighted its broader physiological effects, including on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS regulates involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, and reflexes. The vagus nerve is a significant component of the ANS, primarily responsible for the parasympathetic (rest and digest) response.

 **Evidence Linking Vitamin D and Vagus Nerve Function** 

1. Cardiovascular and Autonomic Regulation: Vitamin D has been shown to mediate several nongenomic actions that involve transmembrane receptors and secondary messenger systems, which are crucial for cardiovascular health and autonomic regulation. Activated vitamin D coordinates molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the function of the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS), thereby influencing cardiovascular disease risk 1.

1. Vasovagal Syncope in Children and Adolescents: A study found that children and adolescents with vitamin D deficiency exhibited lower cardiac vagal tone, suggesting that vitamin D plays a role in cardiovascular autonomic nervous system function. The study indicated a positive correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and measures of cardiac vagal tone 2 .

1. Vagus Nerve Stimulation Benefits: The  **activation of parathyroid hormone**  for converting vitamin D3 to active vitamin D relies on the vagus nerve. This connection underscores the importance of vitamin D in the context of vagus nerve function and its impact on mental and physical health 3.

1. Cardiac Autonomic Activity in Healthy Humans: Research has demonstrated that vitamin D levels are associated with cardiac autonomic activity. Specifically, exposure to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D attenuated rapid heart contractility, suggesting a relationship between vitamin D and vagal inhibitory outflow. This indicates that vitamin D may augment autonomic vagal control, potentially through its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind directly to nuclear vitamin D receptors 4.

*  **Conclusion**  The evidence suggests that vitamin D plays a role in supporting vagus nerve function and, by extension, the autonomic nervous system. This relationship is particularly evident in the context of cardiovascular health, where vitamin D deficiency has been linked to decreased cardiac vagal tone and altered autonomic balance. These findings highlight the potential of vitamin D supplementation or adequate sunlight exposure as strategies to support vagus nerve function and overall autonomic nervous system health. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to establish concrete recommendations for vitamin D intake in the context of vagus nerve health.
