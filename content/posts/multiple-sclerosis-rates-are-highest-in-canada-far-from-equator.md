#### MS Society of Canada - 2018?

[Vitamin d](https://mssociety.ca/hot-topics/vitamin-d)

Has very conservative PDF recommendations for both lay public and professionals

Does not different much from the  IoM recomendations for any disease as of 2010 - 600 to 4,000 IU of Vitamin D

The word COIMBRA does not occur once in their recommendations.

After the chairwoman presented the report in June 2019 she was asked about Coimbra successes.

She was totally unaware of Coimbra

Coimbra has not published his findings, as his protocol is totally inconsistent with Randomized Controlled Trials

&nbsp; &nbsp; The protocol, being used by about 50 doctors on 20,000 patient, adjusts the dosing per each patient, rather using a single dose size for all.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It also goes way beyond Vitamin D monotherapy
