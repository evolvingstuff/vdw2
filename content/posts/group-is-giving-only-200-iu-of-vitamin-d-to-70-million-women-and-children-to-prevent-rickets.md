### [Vitamin Angels: We could reach 100 million kids  tomorrow if we had the funding](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Industry/Vitamin-Angels-We-could-reach-100-million-kids-tomorrow-if-we-had-the-funding?)   
Nice introduction at Nutraingredients, May 2013

[Biggest Contributors to Vitamin Angels](http://www.vitaminangels.org/contributors) 

* Cash $500,000+ Sams Club, Flintstone Vitamins, VitaminWater

* Cash $100,000+ Pharmachem labs, Univera, Vitamin World, Barlean’s

* Cash $50,000+ Nutragenetics, Purity Products, Vitamin Shoppe, TwinLab

*  **Pills**  $5,000,000+ ProCaps Labs

*  **Pills**  $1,000,000+ NBTY

*  **Pills**  $250,000+ Capsugel

#### Vitamin Angels have 2 programs - both operated thru NGOs in the country

*  **Operation 20/20**  which gives  **vitamin A**  twice a year

*  **Thrive to five**  which gives multivitamins on a daily basis to only:

> Infants 6 months – 5 years ( **No vitamins for age 0-6 months** )

> Pregnant or lactating mothers

The Vitamin Angels base their supplements on old recommendations from WHO/UNICEF published in 2006.  

 **<span style="color:#00F;">PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span>**  Which has the following graphic

WHO probably goes for the lowest common denominator, example: UK is still just recommending 200 IU of vitamin D

### Problems with low vitamin D

* Only 200 IU for Pregnant and lactating Women 

* Only 200 IU for children age 6 months to 5 years

> Which is not enough to even stop rickets (Turkey reduced rickets by 60X with  **400 IU** )

*  **No vitamins for age 0-6 months** 

> Suspect because infants cannot eat solids, such as pills, until 6 months 

> Suspect that the liquid form of vitamin D became available after WHO recommendation

> Infants 0-6 months REQUIRE vitamin D and extremely rarely get it thru breast milk now

## WHO is still using the old  (1997) recommendations of the Institute of Medicine

 **Rather than the updated 2010 recommendations** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/iom-children.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

where 0-1 year Adequate Intake  is 400 IU of Vitamin D

## Vitamin D intervention Opportunity

WHO does not mention any supplementation for infants until they can take sold foods – at age 6 months. 

WHO recommends a bare minimum of vitamin D, 200 IU starting at age 6 months

The incidence of rickets in several countries around the world ranges from 10% to 70% of all infants

The cost of liquid vitamin D at retail prices is $15 for 90 days of 400 IU drops

So retail price of 400 IU daily for first 6 months of life is $30

Assume that the wholesale price would be $15

Assume that need to treat 5 infants to stop tickets in countries with lots of rickets (20%)

Thus the wholesale cost of vitamin D would be 5 X $15 = $75 to prevent 1 child from getting rickets

### Example:

* After Turkey GAVE 400 IU of vitamin D to all infants, rickets fell from a rate of 6% to 0.1%, a   **60X reduction** 

> Note: This was without any additional Calcium or nutrition.

* Mongolia: 60,000 births/year X $15 = $900,000/year to stop rickets in Mongolia

## Notes

* Vitamin D is the highest cause of rickets, but not the only – lack of Calcium /Phosphrosis

* Expect that after stopping vitamin D at age 6 months that the body’s levels will remain high for a few more months. 

* Wonder the % of rickets which can be eliminated with starting 200 IU of vitamin D at age 6 months?

* In addition to rickets [75 percent of unexplained sudden infant deaths had inadequate level of vitamin D – April 2013](/posts/75-percent-of-unexplained-sudden-infant-deaths-had-inadequate-level-of-vitamin-d)  

   * another study found that 87% of the SIDS babies <1 year showed evidence of rickets

* Need to check assumption: That giving 400 IU of vitamin D daily for 6 months will be enough to stop rickets at later age.

## Opportunity steps

1. Get wealthy people from Mongolia, etc to donate funds to give vitamin D to those children. 

1. Convience Vitamin Angels to provide vitamin D at ages 0-6 months (increases their impact)

1. Convience Vitamin Angels to direct funds donated for liquid vitamin D to specific countries or high risk infants 

## Notes

* Most of the countries with lots of rickets have poor health.in other ways as well

> They have adapted to overall poor health, so may not easily change

* Normalizing vitamin D so as to virtually eliminate rickets will probably also decrease other vitamin D deficiency diseases, such as TB and pneunomia

* Need to give vitamin D to ALL of the infants, not just those who are members of poor families

> Note the experience of Turkey, which needed to give to ALL infants to achieve a national 60X decrease in rickets
