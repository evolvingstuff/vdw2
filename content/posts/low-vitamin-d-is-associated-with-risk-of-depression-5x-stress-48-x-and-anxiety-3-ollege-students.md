#### Impact of Vitamin D Deficiency on Mental Health in University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study

Healthcare (Basel) . 2023 Jul 23;11(14):2097. [doi: 10.3390/healthcare11142097.](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11142097.)

Students pursuing a university education are vulnerable to psychological burdens such as depression, anxiety, and stress. The frequency of vitamin D deficiency, on the other hand, is extensively recognized worldwide, and vitamin D regulates various neurological pathways in the brain that control psychological function. Therefore, the goal of this cross-sectional study was to determine the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and psychological burden among university students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During March-May 2021 in Riyadh, a cross-sectional comparative study survey was delivered to university students. The DASS-21 scale was used to determine the severity of the psychological burden. Both univariate and binomial regression analyses were conducted to analyze the level of significance and influence of several factors on the development of psychological burden. The data were analyzed with SPSS-IBM, and a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Of the 480 students recruited for the study, 287 (59.79%) had a vitamin D deficiency. Significantly (p = 0.048), a high proportion of the vitamin D-deficient students attained a low or moderate GPA compared to the control cohort. 

The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among the vitamin D-deficient students was 60.35%, 6.31%, and 75.08%, respectively, which was significantly (p < 0.05) different from the control group. 

The odds of developing 

* depression (OR = 4.96; CI 2.22-6.78; p < 0.001), 

* anxiety (OR = 3.87; CI 2.55-6.59; p < 0.001), and 

* stress (OR = 4.77; CI 3.21-9.33; p < 0.001) 

were significantly higher in the vitamin D-deficient group. The research shows a strong association between psychological stress and vitamin D deficiency. To promote the mental health and psychological wellbeing of university students, it is critical to create awareness about the adequate consumption of vitamin D. Additionally, university students should be made aware of the likelihood of a loss in academic achievement owing to vitamin D deficiency, as well as the cascade effect of psychological burden.

!!!!Impact of Vitamin D Deficiency on Mental Health in University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study
Healthcare (Basel) . 2023 Jul 23;11(14):2097. doi: 10.3390/healthcare11142097.

Students pursuing a university education are vulnerable to psychological burdens such as depression, anxiety, and stress. The frequency of vitamin D deficiency, on the other hand, is extensively recognized worldwide, and vitamin D regulates various neurological pathways in the brain that control psychological function. Therefore, the goal of this cross-sectional study was to determine the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and psychological burden among university students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During March-May 2021 in Riyadh, a cross-sectional comparative study survey was delivered to university students. The DASS-21 scale was used to determine the severity of the psychological burden. Both univariate and binomial regression analyses were conducted to analyze the level of significance and influence of several factors on the development of psychological burden. The data were analyzed with SPSS-IBM, and a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Of the 480 students recruited for the study, 287 (59.79%) had a vitamin D deficiency. Significantly (p = 0.048), a high proportion of the vitamin D-deficient students attained a low or moderate GPA compared to the control cohort. 
The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among the vitamin D-deficient students was 60.35%, 6.31%, and 75.08%, respectively, which was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) different from the control group. 
The odds of developing 
*depression (OR = 4.96; CI 2.22-6.78; p &lt; 0.001), 
*anxiety (OR = 3.87; CI 2.55-6.59; p &lt; 0.001), and 
*stress (OR = 4.77; CI 3.21-9.33; p &lt; 0.001) 
were significantly higher in the vitamin D-deficient group. The research shows a strong association between psychological stress and vitamin D deficiency. To promote the mental health and psychological wellbeing of university students, it is critical to create awareness about the adequate consumption of vitamin D. Additionally, university students should be made aware of the likelihood of a loss in academic achievement owing to vitamin D deficiency, as well as the cascade effect of psychological burden.
