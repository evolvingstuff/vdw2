#### Transcript

(00:11) Okay, well, welcome, everybody, and a very special welcome to Dr. Coimbra, who is one of the world's most famous and appreciated doctors for using therapeutic levels of vitamin D to treat autoimmune disease and MS. And I'm incredibly grateful to have you here, Dr. Coimbra. If you if we could start by having you tell us a little bit about your medical background. 

Yes, first of all, thank you for having me and for giving me this opportunity to talk about some such important issues. I was graduated in 1979 and I completed my medical residencies in internal medicine and adult neurology in southern Brazil, state of Rio Grande do Sul. From 1980 to 1984, I also did a fellowship in pediatric neurology. Yes, actually, it was between 1985 and 1986 at Jackson Memorial Hospital. In Miami. I earned my master's degree in 1988 and a PhD degree in neurology in 1990 from the Federal University of Sao Paulo. Aside from a two-year research period in experimental research at the University of Lund, Sweden, I have been practicing medicine since my graduation. I worked as an associate professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Federal University of Sao Paulo from 1997 until 2024. That's my background. 

Excellent, thank you. How did you first become interested in vitamin D as a neurologist and a practicing medical doctor? 

##### When he started on Parkinson's in 1990: 300 papers on D and immune system, now 1000X more

Okay. By the year 2000, I had my first appointment with a patient with Parkinson's disease and he had several spots of vitiligo on his forehead. At that time, I was interested in therapeutic approaches that could enhance the synthesis of neurotrophic factors in brain tissue, as these factors could prevent neuronal degeneration. By that time, I had read about reports on the stimulatory effects of vitamin D on the production of neurotrophic factors. Seeking to help that patient neurologically, I prescribed 10,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol to see if his Parkinsonian symptoms could be better controlled. That daily dose was already established as no adverse effect level. When he came back six months later, his neurological state was about the same, but the vitiligo spots had almost completely disappeared.

(04:22) Then I searched medical literature and found  **about 300 scientific papers**  discussing the importance of vitamin D for the immune system. Today we have more than  **half a million papers on that subject** . That was when I started prescribing 10,000 units of vitamin D daily for patients with autoimmune disorders, not only MS, but mainly for MS patients because, as you know, I'm a neurologist. And I was amazed the results were impressive just by giving them 10,000 units of vitamin D. At that time, I found a paper published in 1986 by Goldberg and co-workers from Boston reporting a reduced frequency of relapses in MS patients taking about 5,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil. And they demonstrated it was just a simple research. They compared the frequency of relapses before giving them about 5,000 units of vitamin D and during the period when they were receiving that amount of vitamin D.

(06:08) And they found a reduced frequency of relapses. So that was the beginning of everything. Well, thank goodness you found that research. And I said, it's a good thing you found that research. I was looking for it. 

So are you going to explain in a little more detail about why vitamin D is important in the treatment of autoimmune disease? Did you want to get to that first or do you want to kind of just discuss a little bit more about how that evolved into what is now known as the Coimbra protocol?

(07:02) I would like to start explaining general issues about the importance of vitamin D for our organism. Okay, let's do the presentation now. Go ahead if you would like. Can you see the presentation? Yes. Okay. So this first presentation shows that vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB light, sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow.  So vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow that is not larger than our stage. If you are living in big cities, working in a confined environment and are not properly supplemented with vitamin D, then you are definitely vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is actually a precursor of steroid hormone and can be turned into its correspondent active hormone in several of our cells, not only in kidney cells as most people believe. Okay. Dark-skinned individuals required about five to 10 times longer exposure to sunlight to produce vitamin D compared to fair-skinned individuals. So dark-skinned individuals living in high latitudes are likely to develop severe vitamin D deficiency and they are more susceptible to a wide range of apparently unrelated diseases like tuberculosis and hypertension. So at least in Brazil, the sunscreen was launched in 1960, in 1984. So, from that moment on, there were a lot of propaganda trying to make people to avoid any kind of, any minimal exposure to sunlight. And this had two consequences. For instance, if you use a protection factor of 8, that blocks approximately 95% of production of vitamin D.

(10:39) And if you use a factor of 15, then approximately 99% of the continuous production of vitamin D will be blocked. So in addition to that, the second consequence is that sunscreens can contain aluminum hydroxide coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles. And those nanoparticles can penetrate the intact skin. And aluminum is extremely toxic metal. That vitamin D is not actually a vitamin, it's a steroid hormone. It converts into a hormone in several of human cells and it's needed by nearly all cells for their functions. Low vitamin D levels play a role in the development of many diseases. So this is the number of just a few examples of diseases that are affected by the level of vitamin D that a person has. And you see it for general human health, you have almost 2 million papers already published. This led us to this publications by Stumpf in 2012, he said that vitamin D is as fundamental as the sun and the closest we have to a panacea.

(12:39) Regarding the immune system, we have more than half a million publications available in Google Scholar. And here is just a slide to demonstrate how important vitamin D is for the immune cells. Suppose that you have immune cells that has phagocyted mycobacterium tuberculosis. So it's within the cell and the cell has to destroy it. In order to do that, mycobacterium tuberculosis, as any other bacteria, is stimulated as toll-like receptors. And as a consequence of that, messages are sent, chemical messages are sent to the nuclei of immune cells. And this makes immune cells to express the 1-alpha hydroxylase, which turns the 25-hydroxy D to 25-hydroxy D, which is the active form of vitamin D. And this active form of vitamin D stimulates the vitamin D receptor. As a consequence of that, catechins are produced, and these are compounds that destroyed virtually any kind of microorganism that has invaded our body. So we see how important vitamin D is for the immune system. If we don't have vitamin D, then the bacteria like mycobacterium tuberculosis will remain alive within the immune cells. So if we look for vitamin D and infectious disease, this slide shows that by 2021, there were almost 300,000 peer-reviewed publications on the functions of vitamin D in the immune system. And today, in 2025, we have almost 400 papers published. Infectious disease, you see this large number of publications showing how vitamin D level is important to control all of those infectious diseases. I would like to show you an example of that by presenting Dr. Auguste Rollier. He died in 1954. He was a Swiss physician who treated tuberculosis in the first half of the 1900s, at a time when no effective antibiotics were available to combat that highly contagious chronic disease.

##### TB Sanatoriums

(16:39) And he built up in the Swiss Alps at 2,000 meters above the sea level. He built up 36 edifices with large balconies, as you see here. And he used to treat tuberculosis by exposing his patients to sunlight. And the reason why he had to be 2,000 meters above the sea level is because he wanted to be above the clouds so that he would have sunlight throughout the year. So the treatment consisted of daily escalating solar exposure.

(17:48) His buildings were called sanatoriums. One sanatorium situated in Davos appears in the novel The Magic Mountains by Thomas Mann, who was first published in German in November 1924. This is an example of his results. On the left side of the slide, we observe a four-year-old patient with 34 foci of osteoarthritis, adenitis, like you will see here, numerous ulcers, as this one. I would like you to pay attention to this one, and tuberculomas affecting his right forearm.

(18:50) The patient also presents with advanced tuberculosis affecting both feet, the right hand, the left lung, and the abdomen. We call it peritonitis. He was extremely thin, had a lot of, he had lost a lot of body weight, and at a level that we call cachexia. His lower left shoulder suggests that he had also had rickets, and it's important to say that rickets, children with rickets frequently died because of tuberculosis, and at some point, some medical doctors thought that tuberculosis and rickets had the same origin. On the right side of the slide, we see the same patient one year later, healing of ulcers, deconstruction of bones, muscles, and the general condition. And you see that ulcer is now healed. At a time when the importance of vitamin D for our immune system was not known, Dr. Joliot credited the success of his treatment to exposure to sunlight and to the pure air of the mountains.

(20:47) The effectiveness of solar exposure in treating tuberculosis is evidenced by the establishment of sanatoriums in various locations worldwide, including the mountain regions of southern Brazil. However, at some point, the sanatoriums were fitted with glass windows and glass blocks the UVB rays, which are required for vitamin D synthesis in the skin. As a result, the sanatoriums ceased treating tuberculosis and were closed at a time when the first antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment, the injectable streptomycin was introduced to the market. Now sanatoriums turned into hotels in the Swiss mountains. So low vitamin D goes to low catalytic synthesis, allowing microbes to remain alive within the immune cells. And that leads us to the Trojan horse mechanism. We see here the structure of the blood-brain barrier,

(22:16) including the astrocytic podocyte, participating in this barrier. And we see that some virus like HIV virus, when you have low levels of vitamin D, they are not destroyed by the immune cells. And when the immune cells penetrate the blood-brain barrier, because they have the mechanism, those cells have the mechanism required for this penetration, it's carrying virus. So that's the way when the brain becomes infected by HIV and several other virus probably, like in some types of severe measles and like in polio, you also have the same mechanism. This is called the Trojan horse mechanism because the virus enters the brain within the immune cells. And by doing that, they bypass the blood-brain barrier. In September, 2018, the WHO called for urgent action to end the tuberculosis epidemic. Prior to the COVID epidemic, tuberculosis was the deadliest infectious diseases.

(24:07) It was killing like 2000 people per day worldwide. The combined use of multiple antibiotics to combine the antibiotic resistance has shown limited effectiveness nowadays. So autoimmune, this is an important issue to our protocol. Autoimmune diseases are almost always triggered by stressful life events. And managing emotional stress should be regarded as essential for the success of all therapeutic approaches, not only related to autoimmune diseases, but also to several other diseases. So then we are merged into this vicious cycle when emotional distress leads to reduced magnesium. And as magnesium is required for vitamin D activation, then you have reduced vitamin D activity. And that increases the possibility of acquiring an autoimmune disorder. And when the patient has a chronic disease, has acquired an autoimmune disorder, then this contributes to deepen the emotional distress. So reduced magnesium also causes excessive reaction to daily life problems and increases emotional distress. So this emotional distress disrupts the epigenetic control of dirty genes that we call the SNPs that we all have. We all have dirty genes, but they are usually switched off since prenatal life. And when we have a high level of stress, this in a way switch on those genes. So if you look for autoimmune disorders and stressful life events, we know we today have like more, almost 12,000 papers published. This is an example. Association between stressful life events and autoimmune disorders. Now going to vitamin D and autoimmune diseases, the issue of vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. We have more than 200,000 papers published. And so all those autoimmune diseases have tens of thousands of papers published relating them to low levels of vitamin D. So all the vitamin D works in autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disease is mediated by abnormal immune response, which is called TH17. There are almost 300,000 papers showing that this is the mechanism involved in the origin of autoimmune diseases. And vitamin D inhibits TH17. We have more than 3,000 papers, 3,000 papers showing the property of vitamin D related to inhibition of TH17. You see, it suppresses the TH17 cytokine production. This slide is to review the metabolism of vitamin D within immune cells. Vitamin D, cholecal sepharol is hydroxylated in the liver and released in the circulation. So vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-D enters the cell, undergoes a second hydroxylation within immune cells and the resulting 125-hydroxy-D stimulates a VDR, vitamin D receptor that inhibits TH17 programs and stimulates the proliferation of TH17. regulatory T cells. Okay, this is the same slide. So vitamin D and TH17, as I told you, we have like more than 30,000 publications. And how we adjust the dose of vitamin D. Here we have the parathyroid cells, a cell of one of the four parathyroid glands that we have close to our thyroid gland. And the vitamin D that is activated in the liver also enters the parathyroid cells. It's activated and simulate as VDR and the simulation of VDR by the active form of vitamin D inhibits the production of PTH, parathyroid hormone. So what we do in order to match the level of resistance that a person has to vitamin D is to measure PTH before the treatment and after five months of treatment. So when we increase PTH, when we increase vitamin D, PTH decreases and the goal is to decrease PTH to just above the lower level of the reference range for PTH. So PTH inhibition has two advantages as concerned to our protocol using high doses of vitamin D. It shows the level of individual resistance to vitamin D. And if PTH is not decreased below the lower level of the reference range, then this assures safety. It means that we are pretty sure that there will be no intoxication. Intoxication meaning increased level of calcium.

##### Vitamin D Resistance

(32:45) Before we go on, are you going to talk a little bit more about what vitamin D resistance is? 

Patients who have autoimmune disorders, they have polymorphic changes affecting any combination of the nine genes that is required for vitamin D effects.

(33:35) So we don't know the level of resistance that a specific patient may have. So we have to test it. So we give a testing dose that could be something like 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And so vitamin D starts increasing and it takes like three, four or five months to level off. So we measure PTH before starting vitamin D, the supplements with high doses of vitamin D and after five months. So at the end of this five months, we see how much vitamin D, when we increased vitamin D, how much PTH decreased. That was what I was trying to show you when I showed this. Suppose that this is the level of PTH that you have before the treatment, before taking 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And this is the level of PTH that you have five months later. So it should be just above the lower level of the reference range. If it has decreased below that level, so I have to decrease the daily dose of vitamin D. If it is far above the lower level of the reference range, so I still have to give more vitamin D as compared to what I was giving during this period of test, okay? So the first six months is like a testing period. We give a testing dose and we see how much the level of, I mean, how much the level of PTH will decrease. So at the end of these five months periods, when we receive the patients in a second appointment, then I look at the level of PTH and I have to calculate how much PTH, how much vitamin D, how much vitamin D I have to give in addition to that previous dose or how much vitamin D I have to decrease as compared to that previous dose. I don't know if I explained myself properly. Well, if you wouldn't mind going back to one of the slides that shows the immune cell.

(36:52) One of my favorite presentations of yours was a presentation you did in Germany and you showed these slides that explained visually what happens like regarding the vitamin D resistance and why that leads to a decreased activity of vitamin D or a decreased response to vitamin D so that the more vitamin D resistance there is in an individual, the less vitamin D activity there is and the more vitamin D they'll need to overcome that vitamin D resistance. 

(38:11) So this is one of my first patients that I treated. She had SLE, and that was the result of only 10,000 units

(39:02) of vitamin D per day after six months of treatment. So you imagine how impressed I was because that was the only change. The only change that I did in her treatment was to add vitamin D, 10,000 units per day. So you see her right face here, the difference between before and after the treatment, the left face. So here you see another patient with psoriasis. You see the psoriasis lesions affecting this area of her face.

(39:55) And after six months taking 10,000 units of vitamin D, of vitamin D, you see this benefit that she had. You see the difference giving her 10,000 units of vitamin D within, after six months, you see how improved the lesions were. So this is the same patient. So here you have patients with multiple sclerosis. And she was born in 1982. And this is when she had the first flare of multiple sclerosis. So this MRI was taken in March 14.

(40:56) And you see those lesions, those were recent lesions because it was her first flare. Okay, it's important to say that because vitamin D has also effects on the cells that produce myelin, which is called oligodendrocytes. So it promotes remyelination in multiple sclerosis. But that remyelination only occurs when you have recent lesions. When you have lesions that are older than one year, back when you start the treatment.

(41:43) So it's more difficult to have remyelination of lesions. But that provides a comparison between March 2011 and July, 2012. More than one year had elapsed between one MRI and another. This lesions, those lesions were active in the first set of MRIs. I'm not showing you this here, but they were making up a contrast. So you see here another patient who had a lesion, MS lesion affecting a critical area of the brain.

(42:49) This lesion can cause severe symptoms and disability. It was a patient born in 1989. The first slide was taken, the first slide is on the MRI made in April 18, 2011. And the second slide was done about two years later, more than two years later. And you see the disappearance of that lesion. It was also a recent lesion. There were kind of lesions, old lesions here who had lesions, not so old lesions, but you see that maybe the spinal cord is a little bit swollen because of some lesions were present here, but they also had disappeared two and a half years later. So this is a severe type of multiple sclerosis. It's called Malon concentric sclerosis. It's a severe disease related to multiple sclerosis. Usually patients do not survive for more than two or three years after the diagnosis. And you see the first MRI that was taken in October, 2008.

(44:30) And there were several MRIs in between, but like five years later, you only have the scar of those lesions and no additional lesion. So that was impressive to me. I was impressed with that case because as a neurologist, I know how Malon concentric sclerosis is a severe disease. So this slide is to show why we should not use the active form of vitamin D to treat those patients. So colicalciferol, which is the form of vitamin D that we give to patients orally, goes to the liver, undergoes the first hydroxylation, turning it into 25-hydroxy-D. This increase in 25-hydroxy-D has no effect, does not inhibit the 25-hydroxylase located in the liver. So the 25-hydroxy-D goes to kidney and to immune cells like mycophages, and you'll find one alpha hydroxylase in both sites in both cells. So they turned one alpha hydroxylase into a drug they turn in the 25-hydroxy-D into the active form of vitamin D. The kidney releases into the circulation, the blood serum, but the immune cells like mycophages use this active form of vitamin D to supply its needs. So it's not supposed to release in the circulation. So when one 25-hydroxy-D is released in the circulation, it inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. And this is an important step to prevent intoxication because the one 25-hydroxy-D is capable of increasing calcium levels to a very high level. So we should avoid having that. And when we give a cholecalciferol, you see that when the kidneys release the one 25-hydroxy-D, the one 25-hydroxy-D released in the circulation inhibits the renal enzyme. So one 25-hydroxy-D go to the intestines and bones and it releases calcium in the circulation and the release of calcium in the circulation further inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. But this has no, calcium level has no effect in the one alpha hydroxylase located in the immune cells. So that's the reason why we should use a cholecalciferol and not never use a one 25-hydroxy-D because if you use one 25-hydroxy-D, you will bypass all this controlling homeostatic mechanisms that this does not happen when you use cholecalciferol. So this is something important. It shows how one alpha hydroxylase works both in the kidneys and in immune cells and in several other tissues like the brain, placenta and several other tissues. So the reduced form of one alpha hydroxylase is capable of synthesizing one 25-hydroxy-D but it requires magnesium as a cofactor. But when it turns 25-hydroxy-D, D into 125-hydroxy-D, it gets oxidized. So in the oxidized form, one alpha hydroxylase cannot pick up another molecule of 25-hydroxy-D to turn it into the active form of vitamin D.

(50:24) So it has to go back to the reduced form. This enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, comprising like more than 100 enzymes. And this family of enzymes have an auxiliary enzyme that is called reductase of the cytochrome P450. And this enzyme requires both the active forms of vitamin B2 as a prosthetic group. And it's capable of reducing the oxidized one alpha hydroxylase. When this occurs, the reductase is oxidized, but it is capable of reducing itself back to the reduced form of cytochrome P450 reductase. So this cycle has to go on, but in order for this cycle to go on, you need this cycle to go on. So in order to keep hydroxylating vitamin D to the active form, you need magnesium and vitamin B2. And it's important to know that like 10 to 15% of the world population has reduced the ability to absorb riboflavin. Several of those people have autoimmune disorders.

(52:37) This was demonstrated by this article published in 1994. So this is extremely important to me because it's like 10% of the world population. It's important to say that high doses of colic alcephalol should be taken under the supervision of an experienced physician to avoid harm and renal function. 

Real quickly, Dr. Coimbra, can you just define what high doses?  Because some people consider high dose the 10,000 IU a day.

(53:20) Is that the dose that you're talking about? Or are you talking about the doses that you use in your protocol, the 1,000 IU per kilogram, correct? Yes. Okay, 10,000 units per day is an amount of vitamin D that you can produce by solar exposure. So nobody has ever got intoxicated with vitamin D by exposing the skin to sunlight. So if you are lying down on horizontal position, you have a fair skin and the sun is high enough, your skin is a young skin, then you can produce this amount of vitamin D within like 20 minutes or 30 minutes. So it's hard to believe that people still believe that 10,000 units of vitamin D is a high dose of vitamin D considering that this is easily produced by exposing the skin to sunlight. So when I'm talking about high doses of vitamin D, I'm talking about the doses that we give to patients initially, which is 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. So this is a high dose. And maybe it could be called a therapeutic dose because it's what you're using to help treat these patients and not necessarily what somebody in the general population might take just to maintain their vitamin D levels. Never, the general population should not take this high dose of vitamin D. Only patients who have autoimmune disorders and under medical supervision.

(55:41) I'm glad we clarified that because the therapeutic use is a use that should be used with a medical device provider who is observing and watching for toxicity and measuring the PTH and all of that. I just wanted to make that clear. So I'm gonna let you go ahead and keep moving forward. Okay. When we give high doses of vitamin D, I was talking about the initial dose of 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day.

(56:22) This is usually our testing dose for diseases like, say, rheumatoid arthritis, to see how much the PTH will decrease when we increase the dose of vitamin D. But if I am treating a disease like psoriasis, I don't have to start giving that amount of vitamin D. I can give, say, for a patient who weights like 50 kilograms, I can give like 13,000 or 40,000 units per day as a testing dose because it's not an emergency, okay?

(57:12) But that changes when I have an emergency. For instance, if I have a patient with multiple sclerosis who is having a severe disease, I can give that amount of vitamin D per day. For instance, who is at risk of losing his vision because of optical neuritis or just had an episode of optical neuritis like two weeks ago and is coming for the first appointment. So this is, to me, this is an emergency because I know that if I give high doses and I immediately increase the dose of vitamin D, the level of vitamin D to a high level, I know that I can reverse the visual loss that this patient has. So in this case, I would give to this patient a low dose of vitamin D. And what I'm going to tell you has been published. If I don't, probably it was published by a group of Italian researchers in 2018. They showed if you give 600 milligrams of vitamin D or 600,000 units of vitamin D as a single dose orally, on day three, the patient will have a level of vitamin D which is around 18 nanograms per ml. And that, it means that I will normalize the level of vitamin D immediately by giving this loading dose. So, but I will not give this loading dose to a patient that comes for the first appointment and has only psoriasis. There is no emergency in that situation. I can check the level of resistance to that patient six months later and adjust the dose.

(59:53) There's no rush in increasing the dose of vitamin D immediately. But in a patient in that situation, who had a flare of multiple sclerosis affecting his optical nerve, then I may give him this loading dose. I will definitely give him this loading dose because I don't want to miss the therapeutical window to reverse his visual disabilities. I need a high level of vitamin D to be achieved immediately so that I can get the effects of vitamin D in terms of remyelination of the optical nerve. Is that clear enough? So the initial dose may vary according to the patient's condition and to the type of disease that he is having. But we can have intoxication of vitamin D because using high doses of vitamin D because patients should follow a strict diet. They should not have dairy products in their diet and order diet items that have high level of calcium. So they have to follow this strict calcium diet.

##### Urinary Tract Infections

(1:01:40) And sometimes they just, they're doing so well that they just don't feel that this is important and they don't follow the diet strictly as they were recommended to. So one of the causes of intoxication is an unreliable source of vitamin D. Another cause of intoxication is urinary tract infections, particularly pyelonephritis, nephritis, nephritis. For some reason, when you have a urinary tract infection, even if you are not taking vitamin D, any supplement of vitamin D, your calcium level may increase.

(1:02:43) For some, there is a mechanism by which urinary tract infection decreases the urinary elimination of calcium. So it's an important part of the protocol is to prevent urinary tract infections. And because urinary tract infections are caused by microorganisms that are present in our feces, it's extremely important and extremely effective to wash the perianal area after having a bowel movement so that you remove all microorganisms from that area.

(1:03:47) Sometimes we may, for some patients who have recurrent urinary tract infections, after washing that area, they have to apply a topic antibiotic after washing that area. So poor compliance with dietary calcium restriction is another possible cause of intoxication. Hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, like in Basildo-Reeves disease or nodules in the thyroid gland that produce high levels, high amounts of thyroid hormones.

(1:04:45) This condition can, when it's associated with high doses of vitamin D, can lead to intoxication. And this is because thyroid hormones, just like vitamin D, they may remove calcium from our bones and the patient get intoxicated, not because of the calcium in their diets, but because of large amounts of calcium that are released in their bones in that condition. So if we have a patient with Graves' disease, first we have to control the Graves' disease by using proper medications that decrease the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. So it's extremely important to have hyperthyroidism under control before starting this treatment. Basildo-Reeves is autoimmune disorder and responds to high doses of vitamin D, but we cannot start high doses of vitamin D without controlling the release of large amounts of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland.

##### With high-dose Vitamin D need to avoid high-dose vitamin C, Lithium supplements

(1:06:25) So we found, this is for experiences, that when patients are taking very high doses of vitamin C, they may get intoxicated. And high doses of vitamin D, very high doses of vitamin C, reduce a kind of a situation called systemic oxalosis. So we advise patients under this treatment to avoid supplements of vitamin C higher than 250 milligrams per day. So we also found that lithium, this drug that is used in psychiatry, lithium can induce hyperparathyroidism.

(1:07:25) So it can increase the release of PTH in parathyroid hormones, and this can cause intoxication. So if you are at the same time using a high dose of vitamin D and you have a high level of PTH because you are taking lithium, and lithium increases the release of PTH by parathyroid hormones. 

So the use of lithium can cause intoxication when we are using this protocol. Real quick about vitamin C. Is it only vitamin C from supplements, or do you also have to worry about vitamin C from foods?

(1:08:33) Only from supplements. Patients can take as much vitamin C as they want by taking fruits and other foods like that. It's impossible to have very high levels of vitamin C taking those foods. No possible. Okay. And then can you clarify, because I thought you said supplements containing 250 milligrams of vitamin C, or was that 250,000 milligrams of vitamin C? Did I say 250? I believe so. No, please. It's 250 milligrams of vitamin C.

(1:09:22) Just to correct that. Patients should not take more than 250 milligrams of vitamin C per day as a supplement, but they can take any fruit containing vitamin C that will not cause any problem to our protocol. 

##### Calcium levels, hydration, Magnesium

Okay. Thank you. So we also found that but these inhibitors can cause, can increase calcium levels. But at this point, I don't know the mechanism related to that. But we found that once someone, some patients started using those aromatase inhibitors for prevention of breast cancer, some of those patients got intoxicated with vitamin D. I mean, their calcium levels increased above the normal range. So we have a, I don't know if you would like to go through those steps, but we have a protocol. When intoxication happens, we have a protocol to use in order to induce a recovery from intoxication. Maybe it's not interesting to go into those steps. Let's go through it because we might have some practitioners who are interested in learning more and maybe even reaching out to you for training. Patients who are under this treatment, should be aware of symptoms of increasing calcium levels, such as persistent nausea and constipation. When that happens, they should stop taking not only nausea, isolated nausea or isolated constipation. But when the two symptoms are associated, then they should be concerned about the possibility of having high levels of calcium, circulating calcium. So the first measure is to stop taking vitamin D and all other supplements that we give to those patients, except for magnesium. This is important because magnesium is a natural calcium blocker. And it's important to keep the intake of magnesium supplements and sometimes even to increase that dose. So they have to increase the daily hydration for one more liter, because usually when the patients start on that treatment, we ask them to take at least 2.5 liters of liquids in general per day. But in that situation, when those two symptoms are associated, then we ask them to increase the daily hydration to at least 3.5 liters per day. So we doubled the daily amount of magnesium that we use in this protocol. We usually use a hundred milligrams of elemental magnesium three or four times per day.

##### Furosemide, alendronate, bifosfonate also given

(1:13:35) And we have to double that amount. As another step, we start using furosemide, which is a diuretic drug, 40 milligrams. One tablet twice a day for one week and then reduced to once a week. We start supplementation of potassium to avoid the side effect of furosemide, 100 milligrams, one tablet twice a day for one week and then reduced to once a week. We also give them alendronate, bifosfonate, because bifosfonate immediately blocks the release of calcium from the patient's bones. And it's important to say that patients usually get intoxicated because of the calcium, the amount of the large amount of calcium that they are releasing from their bone tissue and not because of the diet. Usually it's not because of the diet, because you are usually following the diet. So giving bifosfonate is a way to stop the intoxication immediately because you stop the releasing of calcium from the bones.

##### Weekly lab tests

(1:15:19) So we ask patients to collect blood and urine samples once a week as prescribed and they are sending those results to us as soon as the results are available. This is different as compared to what happens in US because who receives the laboratory results in US seems to be the doctor. In Brazil, patients and doctors have access to laboratory results. In summary, that's what we do when we have a case of intoxication and all doctors that have been trained in our clinic are taught to use this protocol as part of their training. So those are the lab tests that we use whenever we have a case of intoxication. We order paratormon, obviously if the paratormon is above the lower limit of the normal range, the patient is not intoxicated because when calcium increases above the, it's upper level, upper level of normal range, when calcium is increasing, is increased, it inhibits the release of paratormon by parathyroid glands. So total and ionized calcium are one of the, those four items are blood tests and urinary tests that we always order in order to treat intoxications. TSH is also included here because of course, we want to know if the cause of intoxication is hyperparathyroidism that may begin at some point. So we also order urinary culture, culture of urine to assess sensitivity of antibiotics and we start antibiotics as soon as we receive a positive urine test, urine culture. 

So this is related to your question. Can we pause for a moment and go back? And can you answer the question for me? Is vitamin D toxicity once the patient has shown symptoms, is, are all of those effects completely reversible or are there any permanent, is there any permanent damage from the vitamin D toxicity that these patients experience?

(1:19:11) If we start the treatment of, to reduce, to stop intoxication immediately, then everything is reversed. All damage to kidneys is maybe reversed. If we take a long time to start to do those, that detoxification protocol, then it might, the patient may have some damage to his renal function. But that's why we are deeply concerned about having the patients are aware that they should let us know. as soon as they are having those symptoms. And we gave them laboratory prescriptions.

(1:20:12) I mean, laboratory orders to so that they have laboratory orders to immediately collect the blood samples as soon as those symptoms started. Right. Okay. So this is something that we always give patients laboratory orders without a date, so that they can use it whenever they want, as it's necessary. Even before they contact us, they may start measuring calcium levels in their urine, because the urine, the calcium, the urinary calcium level is the first to increase. So if the urinary calcium is within the normal range, then it's unlikely that this patient has, is intoxicated with the vitamin D. And you also mentioned that the calcium usually comes from the bones. Do you ever see any effect on the bone health with this protocol? Yes. And this is an important question. When we increase, when we give a dose of vitamin D, like 10,000 units of vitamin D, you may expect to have increased the absorption of calcium to your bones. When you increase the dose of vitamin D to more than 20,000 units per day, then the effect on bones is both increasing the absorption of calcium, the assimilation of osteoblasts, and also the increase in the release of calcium from the bones due to the assimilation of osteoclasts. So at some point, you have both assimilation of osteoclasts and assimilation of osteoblasts.

##### Physical exercise is needed to prevent bone loss (people in wheelchairs take a drug)

(1:22:43) And if you increase the dose of vitamin D further, like more than 40,000 units of vitamin D, you will increase, you will stimulate osteoclasts more than you will simulate osteoblasts. So the release of calcium will be increased in those patients. And in order to prevent that, the best measure to prevent that is to do physical exercise. Because if you have strong muscles, you have strong bones. You cannot have weak bones if you have strong muscles.

(1:23:36) This is the way that nature works. If you submit your bones to forces during physical exercise, like musculation, to increase the muscle mass, you will also increase the calcium level, calcium concentration in your bones. So it's extremely important. It's part of our protocol. Patients cannot remain at home just taking high doses of vitamin D. They have to do physical exercises. And I ask them to do physical exercises every day, especially those exercises that are  related to hip muscles. They are simulated to do that every single day, maybe twice a day, if possible, twice a day. And this is extremely effective to prevent the loss of calcium from the bone tissue. Is that what you were asking? Yes. An additional information. Okay. Some patients cannot do physical exercise because they are in a wheelchair for several years. They are in a situation of irreversible damage to their spinal cord, even years before they started this treatment. So I can ask them to do physical exercise. So in that case, I have to use medications that will stop the release of calcium from their bones at the same time when I started giving them a higher level of vitamin D. And it's something extremely important in regarding that question. 

##### Stress and mental health

Is this when we started paying attention to the to the mental health of our patients, meaning when we started to ask them, asking them to control their emotions by controlling their thoughts, because you are under stress because of the thoughts that you are accepting in your mind because of the problems that you are facing. But if you learn techniques on how to control your thoughts as a way to control your stress, I can see that those patients do not require those high levels of vitamin D. And I see in the in the laboratory tests that I have to decrease the level of vitamin D, the doses of vitamin D, because they seem to be no longer so resistant to vitamin D as they were before. And this, that's why the control of emotions has become the basic of this, this therapy. I don't want to keep patients on high doses of vitamin D forever. I want to decrease their daily doses of vitamin D. And I can decrease their daily doses of vitamin D if they decrease the level of stress. So this is part of the treatment.

(1:28:05) I have several patients that are no longer taking high doses of vitamin D because they learned how to control their emotions. So techniques like mindfulness are very important to those patients. And we ask them to look for information like that. And I don't know if I could transmit how important this is for this protocol. It's not about giving them high dose, only about giving high doses of vitamin D to match the level of resistance. This can be the first step.

##### Stress, inflammation decrease in about a month

(1:28:50) But as time goes by, the patient is now aware that he is not, he is no longer having those symptoms that he had before. And one of the most important symptoms is fatigue, fatigue at rest. Fatigue at rest almost disappeared after one month of treatment. And this is a way of measuring the strength of an inflammatory, a systemic inflammatory condition. A systemic inflammatory conditions cause fatigue at rest.

(1:29:40) So if this is decreased after one, one month of treatment, I know that the inflammation, inflammatory process is becoming under control. And that's a question that I consistently ask to all patients. What's your level of fatigue in a scale from zero to 10? Because when they come back, I will ask that question again. Another question that I ask patients is something like this. Suppose there is a scale, an imaginary scale of stress that goes from zero to 10.

(1:30:33) Zero does not exist, would be someone that does not get stressed for anything. So that does not exist. But a level five would be the average level of stress that a person of the, an average person of the population has. And a person that is facing common problems, irregular problems, ordinary problems. And level 10 is the maximum level of stress that a patient may have, that someone may experience. So I ask the patient, what's your level of stress?

(1:31:22) And it's unbelievable. There is no patients that were happy, calm and happy when they got sick. It's unbelievable. And when they got sick, they were facing a stressful life event that was much higher than the stressful life event that they used to face in their lives. So when they start, when they have the first appointment, this is another question that I ask right now, what is your level of stress in that scale from zero to 10?

(1:32:09) Because when they come back, I'll ask them again to see if they could decrease the level of stress. And if they could not decrease the level of stress, I will reinforce the importance of this in order to live a normal life without having to take high doses of vitamin D. This is a really good point and important to know about the Coimbra Protocol, that it's not just about giving very high therapeutic doses of vitamin D.

(1:32:46) It's adjusting lifestyle in terms of exercise, emotional health and diet. And all of those, wow, wow. So you can actually get them off of the therapeutic vitamin D if they can control their stress. That's pretty phenomenal. 

Yes, they can. But sometimes there are patients that are unable to control their stress no matter how much you talk about. But we are always trying in every appointment. And I would say that most patients are now realizing how important this is for the success of the treatment. 

Do you utilize any other nutrients or interventions to specifically address stress for those individuals who have a hard time just controlling their mind and behavior? Magnesium itself has this effect. What was it? Magnesium itself has this effect. So the dose of magnesium is adjusted according to the maximum dose that a patient can have and take without having diarrhea.

##### Magnesium types – 100 mg 3X per day

(1:34:12) So it's important to say that some magnesium salts are not suitable for any treatment like that. For instance, magnesium oxide cause a lot of diarrhea should never be used as a magnesium supplement for those reasons. Because most of the magnesium oxide are not absorbed. They remain in the bowels, within the bowels and high level, high concentrations of magnesium in the bowels cause diarrhea. So we use other types of magnesium compounds

(1:35:01) like magnesium glycine, magnesium glycine, magnesium threonate. Do you use citrate or? No, I don't use citrate because citrate increases the absorption of aluminum in our food. So aluminum is a terrible metal, so I don't use citrate. So citrate is avoided and magnesium oxide is avoided, should be avoided. And we adjust the dose, as I told you, we adjust the dosing according to the bowel movements. The patient should be having bowel movements every day

(1:36:05) at least once a day, but without diarrhea. If they are not having bowel movements every day, they should increase the dose of magnesium. If they have diarrhea, they should decrease the dose of magnesium. So magnesium is given as within multi-vitamin supplement that I give the patients, but just the basic daily dose of magnesium, which should be around 100 milligrams of magnesium three to four times per day within that polyvitamin compound.

(1:37:00) But I give an additional magnesium to adjust the dose according to the bowel movements. So, the literature related to magnesium supplementation says that you have to adjust the dose according to bowel movements, okay? So I think that this is really important to say that some other supplements can reduce stress. One of the supplements that can reduce stress is glycine. Glycine is amino acid and it can reduce stress.

(1:37:50) So we used to use magnesium glycine as a preferential form of magnesium. But if I want to have more effects in the central nervous system, I might use magnesium trionate. If I want to increase the release of, if I want to detoxify aluminum, aluminum today is a major, major concern of ours in this protocol, because we are seeing a lot of patients with problems related to aluminum. But we can get back to this subject in a while if you want.

(1:38:55)  I had a few other questions about other co-nutrients, but I don't know if you're already planning on getting there. For example, you talked about the B2, you've also mentioned omega-3s, and then a lot of people ask about vitamin K, and there's questions about vitamin A. So if you want to save those for later. 

(1:39:28) Well, let me rewind a little bit and ask you, because I think there's a misconception that taking very high doses, or just high doses, not even therapeutic doses of vitamin D can induce deficiency of another nutrient. But the way that I like to refer to it, or several of our other scientists have referred to it is that correcting vitamin D deficiency vitamin D deficiency and taking that 10,000 IU of vitamin D a day as the high dose simply reveals inadequacies of other related nutrients. So it's not necessarily causing another nutrient such as magnesium or any of the B vitamins to become deficient. It's just showing that the intake is already too low to support normal function. Would you agree with that? Or are there any specific nutrients that you also concern yourself with when you're putting your patients on higher vitamin D? Well, I try to increase the capacity of fighting inflammation in my patients.

##### Omega-3 Three times a day

(1:40:57) So the omega-3 that you have mentioned is part of our protocol. So we give them omega-3, high concentrated omega-3 three times a day as part of our protocol. So they will produce their own anti-inflammatory substances. Regarding vitamin K2, 15 years ago, we tried to give vitamin K2 as MK7 to try to prevent loss of calcium in the bones of patients under high doses of vitamin D under our protocol.

(1:41:58) But it was useless, this did not work. So it only made the protocol more expensive. So I gave up using vitamin K2. When you didn't see any buildup of calcium in the arteries or any other tissues that it wasn't supposed to be? If you keep the calcium level, circulating calcium level within the normal range, there is no reason to be concerned about calcification of tissues. Tissues may calcificate if you have high levels of calcium in your circulation.

(1:42:45) So I try, I keep the level of calcium within the normal range by using the diet and other measures, but I don't use vitamin K2. I understood that it was useless. It did not change anything, laboratory tests, bone mass were not changing. 

##### Do you put all of your patients on B2 and other B vitamins? And for how long?

Well, as I showed you, like 10% of the world population cannot absorb vitamin B2  properly. So I keep this high dose, a high dose of riboflavin, which could be something between 50 milligrams to a hundred milligrams, three or four times per day, to make sure that all those patients who have problems related to their absorption of vitamin B2 will have the benefit of receiving vitamin B2 in the larger doses that would overcome their poor ability, poor absorption, intestinal absorption of vitamin B2.

(1:44:54) It's so important for that reason that I showed you in another slide, vitamin B2, the two forms of vitamin B2 is required for that auxiliary enzyme that is necessary for the function of the vitamin D hydroxylases. So this is something important, magnesium and vitamin B2 should be given to all our patients, at least those two additional supplements, but we also give omega-3, high concentration omega-3, and I think that's it.

(1:45:51) Would you like to ask about any other supplements? Well, I was curious if you give any of the other B vitamins or if you ever adjust, I recently interviewed Dr. Stasia Gomenek about her protocol. 

She's also a- Okay, I also give them, that's important, I also give them methylfolate and vitamin B12. Because lots of those patients have abnormalities related to folate cycle. And folate cycle is important for such a large amount of functions, biochemical reactions in our organism, including the production of glutathione. So we depend on a good folate cycle to produce glutathione, which is the main antioxidant mechanism in our organism, the main antioxidant defense in our organism. So I try to provide vitamin B12 and methylfolate, never use folic acid, folic acid should never be used, should never be administered to any patient, because like 30% of the whole population will have problems related to the administration of folic acid. Folic acid is not the normal vitamin B9 that is available in nature. It's produced by pharmaceutical companies as folate that is resistant to heat, but it should not be given to the whole population. No, and because like 30% of the whole population, the whole world population may have problems related to SNPs, related to folate metabolism, I always give them a methylfolate. 

So it sounds like you are, you individualize treatment to your patient's specific needs. You adjust the co-nutrients according to your patient's individual needs. 

##### Folate helps eliminate aluminum (a major health problem)

Yes, I do. But your question is very important. I am always concerned to keep myself in a good state of folate metabolism, which is demonstrated by homocysteine levels. And it's a major factor related to the elimination, detoxification of metals like aluminum. Aluminum is a major, perhaps the major health problem worldwide. I'm not exaggerating. What I'm seeing is impressive. Yeah, and we'll talk more about that a little bit later, especially. as it relates to autism. Do you, so you only measure the homocysteine to get an idea of the B vitamins, SNPs, or do you ever do any genetic testing? I measure homocysteine, especially in, in people who are, who are older than 40 years old. But since I started treating pediatric patients with, with autism, ASD, I was impressed to see that some of them have high levels of homocysteine. And the high homocysteine is related to which B vitamins? Is it just the folate, or is it also B12, or explain a little bit. Maybe related to B12 and B9. B9 is the methylfolate. But you see, vitamin B2 also plays a role in those folate cycles. And magnesium also plays a role.

(1:51:25) So giving magnesium, giving vitamin B2 is giving, giving vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 in the form of methylfolate are important items of our protocol. Just a couple more questions on this topic, because the microbiome is an important piece in our overall health as well, especially when we're talking about autism. Do you ever address the microbiome as part of your protocols? And I believe if you've got a healthy microbiome, your gut can actually produce a lot of these B vitamins. I'm especially concerned about that when I treat patients with ASD. But in all patients, I advise them to have a healthy diet that will, because if your food is related to the type of microorganisms that you have in your bowels, right? In your intestines. So I suggest them to decrease as much as possible the amount of meat that they are eating and change the source of proteins to vegetable sources of proteins and eggs. If this is not sufficient, then try to use fish or other type of meat. And sometimes, yes, I do supplement those patients with probiotics. It's a major concern of ours. 

##### Added Vitamin A to increase cellular Vitamin D

 **[Not confirmed by AI March 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-vitamin-a-increase-the-am-pszR9Zz3RWWBznPueNV9Jw)** 

One more question about other nutrients, because there are certain groups that believe taking high doses of vitamin D can deplete your vitamin A. Do you ever concern yourself with vitamin A? As you are asking questions,

(1:53:51) I am reviewing what I'm doing. Yes, I told you that- Boiler alert. Yes, you remember that I told you that I give patients a compound of vitamins and vitamin A is included to that because in order to vitamin D has its actions at the level of **vitamin D receptor**  within the nucleus, vitamin A will be required. So this is also added to our supplement of vitamin A like 500 micrograms three times per day is part of our protocol nowadays.

(1:54:46) Maybe several years ago it was not, but now it is. Okay, and we're talking retinol, right? Not the beta carotene, the precursors. Sorry? We're talking the preformed vitamin A, correct? Yes. Yes, okay. All right, so just to kind of wrap this little part up, when we're talking, you know, quote high doses of vitamin D is in no more than 10,000 IU a day. Do we need to concern ourselves if, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don't have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? 

Well, will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we've just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight. Well, orally though, it's a little bit different. You know, our body's got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce. And it's, you know, produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they've heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now. And I did not have that kind of problems in any patients, and you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So, I'm really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use, and that's it. 

Okay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four, or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1,000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1,000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine, recommends only 600 units per day, and this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter, and this is completely normal. You can't have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, by higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, but it's still no, it's still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.

Therefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve its biological effect effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. 

##### COVID 600,000 IU of Vitamin D

As I told you, in case of an emergency, like during an epidemic, or the pandemic that we experienced a few years ago, an initial dose of 600,000 units of vitamin D should be given orally, and depending on the body weight of that person, it should, it could be repeated in the next day to achieve the desirable level of 80 nanograms per ml immediately, because it's an emergency. Well, I thought, I already told you that I also considered an emergency patient with MS.

###### - - - - -Must add about 120 minutes to the times after this point

(00:06) If, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don't have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? Will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we've just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight.

(00:35) Well, orally, though, it's a little bit different. You know, our body's got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce, and it's produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they've heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now, and I did not have that kind of problems in any patients. And you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So I'm really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use. And that's it. Thank you. 

All right. Well, I'll let you carry on with your presentation. Thank you so much. 

Welcome. So do you see that slide? Okay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine recommends only 600 units per day.

(02:41) And this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter. And this is completely normal. You can't have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day. But it's still no, it's still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.

(04:32) Therefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve this, its biological effect, effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. As I told you, in case of an emergency, like during an epidemic or the pandemic that we experienced a few years ago, an initial dose of 600,000 units of vitamin D should be given orally. And depending on the body weight of that person, it could be repeated in the next day to achieve the desirable level of 80 nanograms per ml immediately, because it's an emergency. Well, I already told you that I also considered an emergency patient with MS who is at risk of blindness, and then because of optical neurites. And we also treat patients with other kinds, other autoimmune disorders that may lead to blindness, like oviitis, for instance. We also give nine doses of vitamin D to those patients, and I might give a loading dose like that to those patients. So this is a way of classifying patients or classifying their situation as an emergency or not. So if it's an emergency, we have to use high doses of vitamin D. So, but I would like to to emphasize this, 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, only a minor change in the level of vitamin D as compared to someone who takes zero units per day. Zero units per day. And the IOM advised 600 units per day. So we see that this is an absurd, and I don't understand how this advice has remained for so many years, in spite of those publications like that, repeated publications. So the importance of vitamin D in pregnancy. I saw that this was one of your questions, and it's one of my main concern also. Vitamin D has numerous effects in pregnancy.

(08:20) It's sufficient to say, as a preliminary information, that vitamin D is activated in the placenta, both in the maternal side of the placenta and in the fetal side of placenta. The placenta expresses that one alpha hydroxylase enzyme that turns vitamin D into 25-hydroxidine into the active form 125-hydroxidine. And this has microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. It will prevent a miscarriage due to autoimmune aggression against the fetal tissues.

##### 7,000 IU of Vitamin D daily during pregnancy reduces the risk of many offspring health problems

(09:23) So the same article that I was mentioning here by Liu and Hewson also showed all those situations that you may have if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. And I would emphasize the maternal-fetal HIV transfer, autism, multiple sclerosis. just later on in this individual life. Type, the risk of diabetes in childhood if the mother had low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy, and asthma. And all those complications in pregnancy, you may have, if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. So you can imagine how much problems you may, the number, the amazing number of problems that you can prevent by just giving a pregnant woman an amount of 7,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is completely safe. It's important to say that some of our patients, MS patients, for instance, who were unable to get pregnant when they started receiving high doses of vitamin D, they got pregnant within a few months. So, and you have vitamin D and fertility, you have like more than 70,000 papers published related to that. As a neurologist, I'm really concerned about fetal brain development. And I see that patients who are having 7,000 to 10,000 units or even high doses of vitamin D, as we use in our protocol, the neurodevelopment of those children are amazing. It's amazing, amazing.

##### Children born of parent with high vitamin D have high IQs, are happier, etc.

(12:09) They are not only have a high IQ, they are happy child, children. It's amazing, they are completely different to (other) children. So, I'm always wondering what will happen with humankind when the advice of giving 10,000 or at least 7,000 units of vitamin D during pregnancy, what will happen with humanity? Because we'll have a completely different kind of human beings, as I have seen during this 20 years when I started using this protocol.

(13:06) But I have to say that this benefit may be lost but I have to say that this benefit may be lost due to administration of vaccines containing aluminum nanoparticles in pregnancy and in large amount, increasingly amounts of vaccines that we are giving to children. So, if you don't mind, we can go into this issue. Let's just pause for a moment. Is this gonna be the last set of slides on autism? Or did you have, because I really do, for the practitioners who are interested in going through the training for the Coimbra Protocol. I really wanted you to share a little bit more about what's involved with that. I know I sent some questions from our own scientist panel and some of the other doctors in our network, but I would like to just kind of turn the conversation from that for the general public to those who are in the medical field who might wanna come and learn more from you.

##### Training Coimbra Protocol Doctors in 5 days, no charge

(14:39) So, you are asking about training for other doctors, is that what you mean? Yeah, I sent some questions about the training and the protocol, such as what is the cost of participation and what is the curriculum? How many hours does it take? You know, if you could just kind of share a little bit about what is expected for those who want to be trained, because we don't have enough Coimbra Protocol practitioners in the United States. So if there- You have five of them. I trained five medical doctors. I think that four medical doctors and a lady, an osteopathic lady that works in the US. I'm not sure how many of them are still working. I have received messages only from a few of them, but we never charged anything for medical doctors who came to Brazil to have a period of training. This usually takes a week, actually five days, from Monday to Friday.

(16:16) They see me treating patients, and they ask questions, and I respond to those questions as deeply as I can. But there is no charge. They have to only to deal with travel expenses, or hotel expenses, but nothing is charged by myself. I don't charge anything for that. I stopped training doctors during the pandemic, and I'm now planning to resume those trainings, but I have to adjust my schedule to resume those trainings, because you see, you have a patient in the room, you have myself, you have one or two, or sometimes three doctors asking questions at the same time when I'm seeing those patients and prescribing to those patients. But I try to do as much as I can. 

Is there any other question that you had about that? 

Well, do you have any idea when you're going to resume training, and how will we know, and then how would somebody get ahold of you to arrange to come and be a part of that? 

Maybe in the second half of this year. There are several issues now going on in my professional life, and related to that, I'm receiving demands from doctors who had a period of training here, and every now and then they ask questions about the cases that they are seeing. But I'm trying to do the best I can. Okay. So they could email you and arrange that, and then you'll be able to respond.

(18:46) Yeah, during those five years, there is a huge list of emails that have been sent asking for a period of training. But I'm the only doctor in this clinic that is providing this clinic in English. And so it's a lot of work. You need to train more trainers. Train more trainers, yeah. But it has to be feasible too. 

One more curiosity before we move into autism. Did you see a lower incidence of COVID, severe COVID deaths among your patients who were on the high doses of vitamin D, the therapeutic doses? 

##### None of the Protocol patients receiving high dose of Vitamin D got COVID

In patients who were receiving high doses of vitamin D, none of them had COVID. In patients who were receiving what I consider the normal dose of vitamin D, which is 10,000 units, for someone who has a normal body mass index, they had only mild manifestations of COVID. There is thousands of publications now showing that low levels of vitamin D are related to severe cases of COVID and advising supplementation of COVID. When the COVID-19 started in 2020, I advised, I even recorded a clip that was published by one of my colleagues in the Facebook. In that video clip,  **I advised all patients to take 600,000 units of vitamin D immediately**  and started 10,000 units per day afterwards. 

##### Major setbacks when his patients got mRNA COVID vaccines

Some patients that were on high doses of vitamin D and had their autoimmune disorder under control, they had flares, MS patients had flares and new lesions when they took those mRNA vaccines. And that was kind of disappointing because, those were patients that were having a normal life for like 10 years and then they had those shots and then suddenly they have a new flare, a new lesion, active lesion. And we had to deal with this and that caused us a lot of problems.

(22:20) That was one of the issues that increased the amount of work and contributed to stop receiving other doctors for a period of training in our clinic. Did I answer your question or? Yes, yes, absolutely. If you don't mind, yes, absolutely. 

Okay, so I've been in touch with Dr. Renu Mittani, who was also trained with you and I know she's training in India and I'm not sure about training in other parts of the world, but would you encourage others to seek her and others who are possibly also training the other doctors in the Coimbra protocol to reach out to them? 

Yes, definitely. Dr. Renu Mittani is a very clever and efficient lady. She is doing a wonderful work training other doctors and I definitely need other doctors to train doctors so that I'm the only one to be trained. I'm the only one.

(24:16) I don't want to be the only one person training doctors in this so-called Coimbra protocol as it's now known by my patients. Definitely, I would encourage her to continue. She's been in touch with me because of that and I have already encouraged her to go on with that activity. So she's got your full support. That's good to know.

One concern that she brought up, and I'm curious if this is also a concern for you in Brazil, is that some doctors, some practitioners who are doing the high dose, the therapeutic dose, vitamin D, there's some concern on their end for legal or lawsuits, legal actions taken for patients who do reach that toxicity. Has that ever been a concern for you? Have you had to deal with that in your practice? Or what is something that you could tell doctors who are, or do you already tell practitioners who are doing this to? Well, you understand that we are facing opposition from the medical community. And it's been like that since we started with this protocol. We started with this protocol. But I have to deal with this. This is something that I, it's part of my routine now. And I, what can I say? 

##### Riboflavin (B2) + Magnesium may treat most migraines, but are not used by doctors

For instance, if you go to the to Scholar Google, and you type migraine, and you type riboflavin, you will see that there are thousands of publications showing that high doses of riboflavin, like 400 milligrams per day, control migraine in 80% of cases. And if you increase, if you add magnesium to that treatment, you will reach close to 100% of cases under control. And you'll see that there is placebo control groups, studies using placebo control groups, randomized placebo control groups, everything that is suggested or indicated by the so-called evidence-based medicine.

(27:22) But there is not a single word about riboflavin in the textbook of the medical doctor that treats migraine. So, it's my opinion that the transmission of knowledge within the medical community is under strict control. And it seems to me that any kind of new therapy that is addressing the cause of diseases and carries the possibility of decreasing the commercialization, the trade of medicines, they seem to be excluded from textbooks and medical meetings.

##### It does not matter if you have 100,000 publications – (if there is no profit from it)

(28:33) So, it doesn't matter if you have thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of publications, they are not mentioned. So, I don't have anything to do about that. I just have to keep my work, to do the best I can for my patients. And when there is some litigations, I have to try to deal with that in the best way I can. But I cannot be stressed because of that, because I know that stress triggers diseases. So, it really has to be part of the routine. Even Dr. Mittani has received criticisms from her peers. So, I think that this is expected. It's not something that you should be surprised to see about that. Maybe in some countries like the U.S., The pressure on medical doctors may be higher than in other countries, for obvious reasons. Most pharmaceutical companies are located there, but it's something, it's a problem that we have to face. Because I bet you've probably seen the amount of effectiveness that comes from the use of therapeutic doses of vitamin D, how effective it is. And I'm assuming, correct me if I'm wrong, that it's probably safer than a lot of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market for some of these diseases that you're treating with vitamin D. I'm sure about that. The medicines that are sold to treat autoimmune disorders are very expensive, very, very expensive. There is one medication for MS that five tablets cost like $46,000 in US.

(31:23) So you can imagine what is happening, when you, what would happen when someone tries to provide another treatment that instead of causing depression of the immune system, enhances the power of the immune system in fighting infections. And there is something else that I have to add, some other information. Most of, when they say that in order to be accepted by the medical community, you have to perform a placebo-controlled, randomized placebo-controlled study, multicentric.

##### Not willing to have a control group of people not getting Vitamin D in an RCT

(32:25) We don't have money to make a multicentric study. I would never ask some relative of mine to take part of a study like that using, just to prove that vitamin D given in high doses controls those autoimmune disorders. Because I know that those patients who fall in the control group will be damaged and will be damaged forever. So I don't feel comfortable about that. I would never do that. And another issue is that this type of study is impossible.

##### RCT would be impossible anyway, as his protocol must adjust the dose, etc for each patient

(33:21) It would not be blinded, double-blinded, because you have to adjust the dose according to the resistance of the patient. So you have to see the laboratory results and adjust the dose according to those laboratory results. That's not possible in terms of placebo-controlled studies, double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Right. So that's it. We have to go on and do as much benefit to our patients as possible.

(34:07) Yeah. And in the meantime, you know, those who do take this into practice can rely on other doctors like you, Dr. Matani, and the many very knowledgeable vitamin D researchers, such as those on the grassroots health panel. We've got a great community of individuals who are well aware of what's going on. Dr. William Grant, for example, wrote the Vitamin D Misinformation Playbook, and he talks about this a lot.

(34:42) And you just can't let that scare you. And just have faith that this really does work. Yes. Some other doctors that were trained in our clinic also have published about the safety of the Coimbra Protocol. And they have other doctors like those were, I guess it was from Germany, they produced two papers. And there is another paper published by Italian groups of medical doctors showing the improvement of quality of life.

(35:29) Those patients having under high doses of vitamin D. So I'm glad to see that other doctors are planning to publish that because I cannot do everything on my own. 

##### Parkinson's is NOT an autoimmune disease, and they have very high levels of stress

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: [Parkinson's may be an Autoimmune Disease (data since 2017)](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-parkinson-s-an-autoimmune-d-mFE80OKPRrGk2bMzmerx3g)

That brings me to a question that one of our doctors sent me, and I hope you don't mind my asking you now, but Dr. Patrick Niccolo has published several papers. He is a medical doctor. He's been using high doses of vitamin D with all of his patients in the hospital that he works at, and he was wondering if you would be willing to collaborate with him on treating patients with Parkinson's disease. That is one of the things that he would like to speak with you about, the therapeutic doses of vitamin D on Parkinson's and then publish it. 

I'm glad that you asked that question. I'm open to cooperate with any doctor, any physician, but I have to say that  **Parkinson's disease is not an autoimmune disorder** , and we don't use this high dose of vitamin D protocol in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is one of the most cases of diseases that we see  **very, very high level of stress in those patients** . They have ever been extremely worried about all problems that they face. They are highly responsible people. They don't want to accept that things are not under possible bad outcome. The outcomes of the problems that they are facing escape their control. They are trying to control everything.

(37:56) They are afraid of things that may happen. They think about every possible outcome of any problem they are facing. This is essentially the personality that is seen in almost 100% of patients with Parkinson's disease. And we have been dealing with Parkinson's disease by trying to change that personality. Of course, we give vitamin D, not in high doses, what I call high dose. I'm not sure what you are calling high doses in your question, but I'm giving like 10,000 15,000 units of vitamin D to patients with Parkinson's disease because several years ago I tried to give them high doses of vitamin D and I felt it did not work. So we are trying other measures to decrease the activity of that disease, like giving glycine in  **high doses of glycine** , which is an amino acid that decreases, that causes calmness, induces calmness. We are associating that with any acetylcysteine (NAC).

(39:43) Also it seems to be working in the first few patients. I hope that impression goes on, but Parkinson's disease is not an autoimmune disorder. And I guess that this confusion came from the fact that doctors that were here to be trained on high doses of vitamin D, because I'm a neurologist, I was also seeing patients with Parkinson's, lots of patients with Parkinson's. And maybe there's this impression that Parkinson's disease is responsive to high doses of vitamin D. That's not my impression, but we correct the level of vitamin D in those patients too, because of the effects of vitamin D has in the central nervous system in the brain, inducing neurotrophic factors that increase the lifespan of neurons. So that's what I have to say about that. No other information I have available. 

Thank you so much for discussing that topic.

##### Autism – started treating in 2014, Bradford Hill (dose response, happening everywhere – Vaccines?)

(41:11) Okay, I would love if you would continue on to the topic of autism. Are you ready? I started treating autism in 2014. And the reason why I started using, treating children with  **ASD**  was because there were publications showing benefits of vitamin D in autism, and also papers showing that TH17 is active in children with autism. So we started using high doses of vitamin D in autism, and we got very good results. But then afterwards, at some point,

(42:17) I faced with this undeniable relationship with autism, and the increasing number of vaccines that we're giving to children. As you see here, in 1970, you had one child with autism, or in 10,000, non-autistic children. So in 2018, you had like one in 36. Today in US, you have like one in 22. And in Brazil, it seems that we are having like one in 10 patients. This is a tragedy. And so we started investigating what could be causing this sharp increase, the rate of autism. And in order to do that, we had to use the method that was published in 1965 by a British epidemiologist. His name was Austin  **Bradford Hill** . And he said, he published a set of criteria that should be used to demonstrate that one factor is causing one disease. And thanks to that, he was able to prove that smoking was a cause of lung cancer. And since then, the criteria of causation of Bradford Hill is used in several other instances. So you could use to try to find out the cause of the explosion of autism. And according to those criteria, there's one criteria that is called the dose response criteria. So if, for instance, if smoking caused lung cancer, if I increase the number of cigarettes that I smoke per day, I will increase the risk of having lung cancer. This is dose response. I increase the dose, I will have an increased response.

(45:22) So if you want to find a factor that is causing autism, you have to find this factor that you are looking for has to follow the dose response criterion of Austin Bradford Hill. In other words, you have to find something that is increasing, some toxic agent to which children are more and more exposed. And the more you expose children to that factor, you increase the response, which is autism. It's like increasing the number of cigarettes

(46:11) in a certain population, smoking in a certain population, you would increase the response which would be the lung cancer. So looking for a factor like that, we have to realize that this factor should be applicable to all countries in the world because the explosion of autism is happening everywhere. It's not something that is happening in Brazil. It's not something that is happening only in the US or in Britain or Australia or any other country.

##### Autism is increasing around the world (along with vaccines)

(46:57)  **So it has to be some factor that is happening everywhere** , that is occurring everywhere. So what has occurred everywhere in all countries is the increase of number of vaccines given to children. So this timeline goes from 1967 to today. To 2012, and you see that by 1985, you had less than 70, less than 70% of children given like five vaccines or five shots of vaccines. In the second half of the 80s, it was the period when the sunscreen appeared and a lot of pressure, a lot of advertising so that people should avoid any kind of exposure any kind of solar exposure. And at the same time, they should be using sunscreen sometimes even if you are under artificial light. So the level of vitamin D dropped suddenly here in the whole population. And when between 1989 and 1990, 1991, there was an outbreak of measles that killed a lot of children, much unusual as compared to previous years when you had no limitations to expose yourself to sunlight. And as a consequence of that, you see that there were more and more and more vaccines. And as you increased the vaccines and the percentage of children covered with those vaccines when you were having more vaccines and more than 90% of children vaccinated. When this was happening, the number of cases of autism also increased. So the increasing of vaccines could be preliminarily accepted as a possible cause of autism, but

only that criterion does not prove that vaccines can cause autism. You may remember that it was like nine criteria. 

##### Criteria of mechanism: found Aluminum in brains of people who died with ASD

So you need another criteria, the  **criteria of mechanism** . So if vaccines cause autism, then there should be a mechanism by which vaccines are causing autism. So in order to find that, you have to look at the composition of vaccines, and all those vaccines that you see here and you give to children have aluminum nanoparticles in their composition. The vaccine given to prevent, to prevent the virus that causes cervical cancer, infection to that virus, also has aluminum salts. So then maybe you have a mechanism if you try to see if aluminum is toxic. So you look, you go to look, scholar Google, and you see that there are  **more than two million papers talking about or discussing about the toxicity of aluminum** . Aluminum is toxic even to plants, not only to animals or human beings.

(52:23) So then you may, then now you have a mechanism that strengthens the possibility that vaccines can be caused. Then you need a final, or what I consider to be a final proof that vaccines can really be accepted as a cause of autism. You have to find aluminum nanoparticles, because the type of aluminum that you inject in vaccines are nanoparticles of aluminum. It's not a soluble type of aluminum that you ingest when you drink water.

(53:17) When you drink water, you are ingesting soluble salt of aluminum and less than 1%, I mean like 0.25% of this aluminum salt that you ingest is absorbed, only 0.25%. And most of that aluminum that is absorbed is easily extracted, eliminated in the urine. That's not what happens when you inject aluminum nanoparticles. Aluminum nanoparticles are used in vaccines because they cause inflammation. And they have the antigens attached to those particles.

(54:20) So the immune cells phagocyte those particles, and that's the beginning of the process of producing antibodies. So if aluminum causes autism, and the aluminum of vaccines causes autism, then you have to find particles of aluminum in the brain tissue of children with autism or individuals with autism. And that was what these researchers from the United Kingdom have done. They published this in 2018 ([Aluminium in brain tissue in Autism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29413113/) [Cited 217 times](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13283697388213251461&as_sdt=5,48&sciodt=0,48&hl=en)). They went to the University of Oxford because the University of Oxford has a bank of brains.

(55:29) Perhaps for the last 70 years, any patient who died in the hospitals that were affiliated to Oxford University and died with a neurological disease of unknown cause, they had their brains fixed with formalin, removed and stored in a bank of brains. So they went to that bank of brains, and they got samples of the brains of individuals that had died, not because of the diagnosis of autism, but with autism.

(56:27) And what they found is this, we can read individuals with a diagnosis of  **ASD**  have extraordinarily high levels of aluminum. This is the British way of aluminum in their brain tissue. So you see what they found in their brains, they found particles of aluminum. In immune cells, this is a lymphocyte, this is a macrophage that has several nanoparticles of, several particles of aluminum inside. So to me, as a medical doctor, since I was graduated, I was taught to give the highest level of importance to what pathologists find in the microscope. They usually have the final word, they say, okay, I was, I looked at the tissue and I found the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. So your patient has tuberculosis, and no one will ever discuss, argue, no one will ever argue against that statement, because it's like you saw the criminal in the scene of crime stabbing the victim, so to speak.

(58:23) So I have to give them the highest level of importance to this finding. So to me, it's quite clear that what is causing autism is the presence of aluminum in vaccines. And it's an absurd, because you could use other nanoparticles, like calcium phosphate nanoparticles, and reports about the effects of calcium phosphate nanoparticles is that they may cause even higher production of antibodies as compared to aluminum nanoparticles.

(59:21) So it's difficult to understand why, if this is being published everywhere, in several papers, in several scientific papers, and the pharma company that produces vaccines continue using aluminum nanoparticles in their vaccines, in their products. So as I told you, the fate of these nanoparticles, of these nanoparticles are completely different from that, that you see regarding soluble salts of aluminum that you ingest. They are biopersistent.

(1:00:10) Maybe we can remember that figure that I showed you demonstrating that I, um, a liquefied can cross the blood-brain barrier, carrying a virus, and thereby it would infect the, the nervous system. And this is called a  **Trojan horse mechanism** . So, if you imagine that this is not a viral particle, but actually, actually an aluminum nanoparticle, you understand why and how the aluminum nanoparticles bypass this barrier and reach the nervous system, the brain, and why it is found as particles within immune cells, like you see here. So, that's what I was telling you about aluminum causing inflammation, attracting immune cells to injection site. Aluminum nanoparticles contain antigens that absorb it. Their surfaces are phagocytized or engulfed by leukocyte, thereby triggering antibody synthesis. This is called adjuvant effect of nanoparticles. There is a chronic encephalitis associated with  **ASD** , and this can be demonstrated by measuring the level of this enzyme called neuro-specific enolase or NSE. Just like when the liver is inflamed, when there is an inflammatory process affecting the liver, the liver cells release their enzymes in the bloodstream. The same thing happens when you have an inflammatory process affecting the brain. Neurons release, the damaged neurons release this enzyme called neuro-specific enolase. Okay.

(1:02:52) The inflammation that is caused by the presence of  **aluminum nanoparticles breaks the blood-brain barrier so that now it's toxins and microbes can have access to the brain tissue** . The adjuvant effect of aluminum nanoparticles induces antibody synthesis against the brain tissue. This has been published. You see, neuro-specific enolase has been proposed as a biomarker of autism spectrum disorder. Many publications about that, more than 10,000 publications.

(1:03:48) Here you'll see 12,600 publications showing there's brain-specific autoantibodies in the plasma of subjects with autistic spectrum disorder. So this is also published. So if you try to combine everything that you know about the pathophysiology of  **ASD** , everything is explained by the toxic effect of aluminum. Even the wide range of metabolic disorders that you find in children with aluminum, in children with  **ASD** , I'm sorry.

(1:04:59) Everything is explained on the basis of the toxic effects of aluminum nanoparticles. So  **ASD**  fulfills the criteria to be classified as an autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. This syndrome was first reported by Schoenfeld and Agmon-Levy in 2011. And they emphasized this, factors entailing an immune adjuvant activity, such as infections agents, silicone, aluminum salts, and others were associated with defined and non-defined immune mediated diseases.

(1:06:05) So adjuvants can cause autoimmune diseases, can trigger autoimmune diseases. And that's exactly what is happening in the brains of children with  **ASD** . They have inflamed brain. Aluminum nanoparticles is within immune cells in their brain. They are infiltrating their brain. And it's definitely ASIA syndrome. So it's important to emphasize the question, the issue about infections. Infections agents can induce an autoimmune disorder, not immune disease.

(1:07:04) And this is exactly what happens regarding the MMR vaccine, because I'll talk to you, talk about that in a moment. This slide shows that interleukin-17 is elevated in the serum of children with autism, just like in any other disease, any other autoimmune disease. So autism and vitamin D releases more than 27,000 publications because vitamin D suppresses TH17 cytokine production. So looking at that picture produced by Rome City, showing that pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines cannot be sued due to a law that was approved in US in 1986. And the number of vaccines containing aluminum that is given simultaneously in a two-month-old baby, I cannot accept that as something that should be considered normal. So this slide shows that regarding the hepatitis B vaccine, the amount of aluminum that is given to a child in the first day of life is equivalent to the amount of aluminum present in 10 shots of the same vaccine given to a 70-kilogram adult person.

(1:09:45) And if you go, if you now go to a baby that is only two-month-old and the baby receives this amount of aluminum per kilogram of body weight, and  **this is equivalent to 24 vaccines given in a single day to a 70 kilogram adult** . This is not acceptable. Here you see the year of 1986, when this National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was approved in US. You see the number of shots that children were having or receiving in 1983.

(1:10:43) And in the number they were receiving in 2023, 76 shots. And now you see that in 2024, it was like 88 doses. So moreover, it's important to say that during pregnancy, during pregnancy, the flu vaccine, the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine, and the RSV vaccine containing aluminum nanoparticles is given to pregnant women and may cross the placental barrier and accumulate in the fetal brain. This has been demonstrated in experimental animals, and probably they cross the placental barrier using the same mechanism of Trojan horse mechanism that you're seeing in the brain tissue. So that's it. If you have any other question, you can just ask me. The reason that I am trying to provide information about the role that aluminum nanoparticles are playing in the pathophysiology of ASD is quite clear to me, and we are facing an emergency. We could be using calcium phosphate nanoparticles that is even more effective as compared to aluminum nanoparticles in producing higher titers of antibodies. And I don't see any reason why you should not change the aluminum to calcium phosphate. In addition to that, it's quite clear to me that if you keep the level of vitamin D, circulating vitamin D that we had in the beginning, up to the beginning of the 80s, children had up to the beginning of the 80s, most of those vaccines would be not necessary.

(1:13:43) We'd decrease the number of vaccines that are required to be given to young children. I'm open to your question. I have two. And my first question, you mentioned the amount of aluminum particles in sunscreen, and I know that women are concerned about aluminum in their deodorant. Now, that is not the nanoparticle form of aluminum, correct? So you're not necessarily worried about it getting into the brain as much as the lymph and causing issues outside, or am I incorrect? This was one of the slides that maybe I missed to mention. I'm mismentioning that. But yes, the kind of aluminum that you apply to the people, apply to their skin to protect them from sunlight is nanoparticles of aluminum. And it's absorbed by the intact skin. Undamaged skin absorbs that aluminum. The amount of aluminum that is absorbed depends on how frequently you apply to your skin. There are people that apply sunscreen like three times per day, even when they are working in an office, believe you or not, they are not exposed to sunlight, they apply sunscreen to their skin. And the surface of your skin that you apply also plays a role, of course, regarding the amount of aluminum that you absorb in your skin. But yes, that's what I can say. The amount is variable depending on several variables, like those that I mentioned, the surface that you apply, the sunscreen, how often you apply, and the concentration, probably the concentration of aluminum is related to degree of sun protection that you have. Because the aluminum is used to reflect the sunlight and prevent them to enter the skin. And that's the reason why they reduced, almost abolished the production of vitamin D. Right. Okay, so it's not like the aluminum that we ingest. It actually is not excreted like the aluminum we ingest.

(1:17:00) It's absorbed and could possibly harm the brain and cause issues, not even related to  **ASD** , but other neurological issues. If this could cause other neurological issues, not only. Yes, they can cause any autoimmune disorder. It can cause learning difficulties. And it's good that you asked about that because the elementary schools are falling apart all over the world at the same time when the autism is raising because children in Australia, Spain, United Kingdom, probably in U.S., yes, in U.S. too, they are not being able to learn almost anything. I received a teacher of the elementary school and I asked her what percentage of her students she could pass information they could learn. And she said that it would be only 15%. So that's why I'm saying that this is a disaster because those children will be the adults of tomorrow and they will have to support society. And they will have to support those who have major disabilities like the severe cases of autism. And that's why I'm saying that we are facing a global emergency. We have to stop that. Otherwise, human society will not be feasible, would not be possible to exist as in the way that we know today. I cannot be more in fact, I cannot emphasize this subject more than I have than in our interviews, in our interview.

(1:19:47) So I expect you to pass the message. 

Yes, one last question. Besides strengthening the immune system and making these vaccines less needed. Is there any other role of vitamin D in reducing the effects of the aluminum or other toxins that might decrease the risk of these resulting diseases, whether it's  **ASD**  or autoimmune diseases that are caused or likely caused by the toxins? 

Yes, vitamin D definitely reduced the risk but does not prevent these to occur. Even in patients, pregnant women who were taking high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy, they may have children with  **ASD**  due to the vaccines that the children received afterwards. Another issue that came to my mind is to say that when a pregnant woman is taking those high doses of vitamin D that we are taking, the baby is born with high levels of vitamin D, very, very high levels of vitamin D.

(1:21:29) And the calcium levels is at the upper limit of the normal range. But they don't have any problems related to that. Afterwards, vitamin D is decreasing. And the level of calcium remains within the normal range. And the mother also provides vitamin D by breastfeeding. So if she is taking high doses of vitamin D, the baby will also receive high doses of vitamin D by when they are breastfed. But this has not caused any problem to our children.

(1:22:31) See, have I answered all questions? 

##### Silica removes aluminum from the body – reduces depression, ADHD, MS etc.

&nbsp; &nbsp; see also <a href="/posts/aluminum-appears-to-increase-ms-alzheimers-etc-silica-water-removes-it" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Aluminum appears to increase MS, Alzheimer's, etc. - silica water removes it">Aluminum appears to increase MS, Alzheimer's, etc. - silica water removes it</a>

There is something else. Well, a final one, just similar topic, because there are some cases of autism that have potentially been treated with high dose vitamin D. Is that something that you've also treated? And is it addressing the aluminum toxicity in the brain? And this might be a whole other topic, but just a brief answer,  **if you are aware of vitamin D reversing the effects of the aluminum toxicity** .

&nbsp; &nbsp;See VitaminDWiki: [Silica reduces Aluminum in the body - perhaps reducing MS, ADHD, Alzheimer's etc.](/posts/silica-reduces-aluminum-in-the-body-perhaps-reducing-ms-adhd-alzheimers-etc)

(1:23:12) High doses of vitamin D in children with autism, it's also an autoimmune disorder. You see, you saw that there are high levels of auto antibodies against the brain. So we give high doses of vitamin D. That was the beginning of the treatment when we started treating those children in 2014. But now we also  **try to eliminate aluminum nanoparticles by giving silica** . And we can see that the level of concentration of aluminum increases in the urine and in the blood at the beginning of the treatment. Important to say that the concentration of aluminum that you have in the blood is 300 times less than the concentration that you have in the tissues, like in the brain. So the level of aluminum that you measure in the blood does not reflect what you have in the brain. And that's why when you start giving silica to those patients, you see that the first phase when aluminum in the blood increases and the level of aluminum in the urine also increases. Then there is a second phase when the level of aluminum is decreasing in the blood. Is it still increased in the urine? And the final phase, when you have undetectable levels of aluminum in the blood and in the urine. So this is a major point for us to address.  **We have to eliminate aluminum** . There is something else that just came to my mind and I think you would be interested to know about. When we started treating patients with  **ASD** , at the same time, we were also treating young people with autoimmune disorders, like MS, for instance, like rheumatoid arthritis. And then we added to the protocol because they were born after 1990.  **We added silica to the protocol.** So this is a major addition to our protocol. We are trying to detoxify aluminum in all our patients.

(1:26:59) And we are amazed to see how much aluminum they are eliminating in the urine when you start giving silica. And this is something that will decrease the process of inflammation in all autoimmune disorders. So this is a major addition to the treatment. Last year, in the last two years, I would say, 2023, 2023, 2024, I was amazed to see because I always ask about all diseases that occur in the family of patients.

(1:27:55) And I was amazed to see the number of young people and adolescents with severe depression, severe depression. Nowadays, children, I would say, a five-year-old, if you have a classroom with like 20 five-year-old children, most of them are taking antidepressive drugs at five years of age. This is unbelievable. This is really unbelievable. I had a case of a young lady that came with her mother. Her mother was an MS patient.

(1:29:02) And this patient, at some point, her mobility started getting worse and worse with more and more difficulties related to her walking ability. And at some point in May, 2023, she had an appointment and she was requiring the support of a cane on the right side and the support of the arm of someone to be able to walk. So she was getting worse and worse during the previous two years. And I told her that all MS patients that I have that are getting worse, in spite of having high levels of vitamin D patients with MS. All those patients that are getting worse, even taking high doses of vitamin D are adjusted according to the laboratory tests, pH level. All of those that are getting worse were having a high level, a very high level of stress. So I asked her, what's your level of stress? Because you are getting worse and worse during the last two years. And she said, in a scale from zero to 10,  **her level of stress was 10** . So I asked her, what was the reason for that? And she said, it was because of her daughter. And I asked her, what was happening with her daughter? And she said that her daughter was taking antidepressant drugs since she was four years old. And at some point in her adolescence, she started cutting herself, self-mutilation.

(1:31:37) And she had attempted suicide twice. So that patient told me that when her daughter was leaving to go to school, she would not be able to say for sure if she was coming back or not. So that was the reason of her high level of stress. So I asked the girl, the young lady to come in and ask her to try to stop that behavior because her mother was getting worse. And she said that she would do everything that she could because she loved her mother very much. But I gave her silica because when she started having when she started with depression, she was taking a large number of vaccines. Well, she came back one year later and I could not recognize that young lady. She was completely different. She was well-dressed. Her hair were completely, were well combed. I can't say that, describe that. I did not recognize her. She was happy.

(1:33:34) She was smiling. And I asked her if she was, how was her depression? And she said that she was 85% better. And her psychiatrist was decreasing the doses of medications that were, that he was, had prescribed. She was taking four medications to keep her alive. And the psychiatrist was decreasing the doses of psychiatric drugs. So I asked her why, what was the reason why she was cutting herself? And she said something that we'll never forget.

(1:34:34) She said that she had to cause pain to herself to stop paying attention to the pain, psychological pain of having depression. Psychological pain of having to live. That was the reason why she was causing pain to herself. But she was not doing that anymore. And she had plans for the future. So that was the first case. But then there were two more other cases and the same result. So we are now seeing an epidemic of self-mutilations among adolescents and young adults. This is happening everywhere. We have seen an epidemic of suicide in several countries. So imagine what this is, the problem, I was, there is a principle, a principle that was proposed more than 1,000 years ago. And it's considered to be the first principle of statistics and says when several things are happening in the same place with the same persons, probably they have one cause, one single cause. This is called the  **principle of parsimony** . And it's used in several, if not all sciences, including in the daily medical practice. To explain all symptoms signs and the laboratory abnormalities that you see in a patient and explain with one single diagnosis. It's called the principle of parsimony. And if we apply the principle of parsimony to all things that we are seeing in our society, in several countries at the same time, autism,  **ASD** , depression, we can find, we have to find one single explanation. And that's to me, that is the presence of aluminum nanoparticles in the brain causing inflammation and causing all these diseases. I have seen increased anomalies levels in children with  **ASD** , with children with, in children with not only  **ASD** , but also attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.

(1:38:07) They also have high levels of inlays, and this is not published, but I have seen in their laboratory results. So I hope that this information is helpful to you because it's an amazing, it's a devastating pain when the parents lose a child because of suicide. Yeah. And they are jumping from the apartments in big cities. They are hanging themselves in small cities. And this is happening in Brazil, and I think it's happening everywhere too.

(1:38:50) I have seen that it's happening in other countries. So you imagine the pain that is, this procedure is using aluminum nanoparticles in vaccines are causing. Okay. Very important message to get out. What? It's a very important message to get out. Thank you. Something needs to change. Yeah. Because it's difficult to deal with those mothers that have a child for those reasons. It's difficult to deal with the mother that brings her 16 year old adolescent child and says, doctor, he depends on me to use the toilet. What will happen to my child when I die? going to take, who is going to take care as I take care now of this child. It's a lot of suffering. And so that's why I decided that I had to tell you this. It's important that this is invest properly investigated. Yeah, my, my boys are 17 and 16 and they're still in high school.

(1:40:22) My, my two boys are 16 and 17 in high school. And it's a big problem, the depression and the, the suicide. It's a major problem everywhere. So I think a lot of people will be thankful to hear this information and I hope that, that there can be some serious action taken from it.

#### Transcript

(00:11) Okay, well, welcome, everybody, and a very special welcome to Dr. Coimbra, who is one of the world&#39;s most famous and appreciated doctors for using therapeutic levels of vitamin D to treat autoimmune disease and MS. And I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have you here, Dr. Coimbra. If you if we could start by having you tell us a little bit about your medical background. 

Yes, first of all, thank you for having me and for giving me this opportunity to talk about some such important issues. I was graduated in 1979 and I completed my medical residencies in internal medicine and adult neurology in southern Brazil, state of Rio Grande do Sul. From 1980 to 1984, I also did a fellowship in pediatric neurology. Yes, actually, it was between 1985 and 1986 at Jackson Memorial Hospital. In Miami. I earned my master&#39;s degree in 1988 and a PhD degree in neurology in 1990 from the Federal University of Sao Paulo. Aside from a two-year research period in experimental research at the University of Lund, Sweden, I have been practicing medicine since my graduation. I worked as an associate professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Federal University of Sao Paulo from 1997 until 2024. That&#39;s my background. 

Excellent, thank you. How did you first become interested in vitamin D as a neurologist and a practicing medical doctor? 

##### When he started on Parkinson&#39;s in 1990: 300 papers on D and immune system, now 1000X more

Okay. By the year 2000, I had my first appointment with a patient with Parkinson&#39;s disease and he had several spots of vitiligo on his forehead. At that time, I was interested in therapeutic approaches that could enhance the synthesis of neurotrophic factors in brain tissue, as these factors could prevent neuronal degeneration. By that time, I had read about reports on the stimulatory effects of vitamin D on the production of neurotrophic factors. Seeking to help that patient neurologically, I prescribed 10,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol to see if his Parkinsonian symptoms could be better controlled. That daily dose was already established as no adverse effect level. When he came back six months later, his neurological state was about the same, but the vitiligo spots had almost completely disappeared.

(04:22) Then I searched medical literature and found  **about 300 scientific papers**  discussing the importance of vitamin D for the immune system. Today we have more than  **half a million papers on that subject** . That was when I started prescribing 10,000 units of vitamin D daily for patients with autoimmune disorders, not only MS, but mainly for MS patients because, as you know, I&#39;m a neurologist. And I was amazed the results were impressive just by giving them 10,000 units of vitamin D. At that time, I found a paper published in 1986 by Goldberg and co-workers from Boston reporting a reduced frequency of relapses in MS patients taking about 5,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil. And they demonstrated it was just a simple research. They compared the frequency of relapses before giving them about 5,000 units of vitamin D and during the period when they were receiving that amount of vitamin D.

(06:08) And they found a reduced frequency of relapses. So that was the beginning of everything. Well, thank goodness you found that research. And I said, it&#39;s a good thing you found that research. I was looking for it. 

So are you going to explain in a little more detail about why vitamin D is important in the treatment of autoimmune disease? Did you want to get to that first or do you want to kind of just discuss a little bit more about how that evolved into what is now known as the Coimbra protocol?

(07:02) I would like to start explaining general issues about the importance of vitamin D for our organism. Okay, let&#39;s do the presentation now. Go ahead if you would like. Can you see the presentation? Yes. Okay. So this first presentation shows that vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB light, sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow.  So vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow that is not larger than our stage. If you are living in big cities, working in a confined environment and are not properly supplemented with vitamin D, then you are definitely vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is actually a precursor of steroid hormone and can be turned into its correspondent active hormone in several of our cells, not only in kidney cells as most people believe. Okay. Dark-skinned individuals required about five to 10 times longer exposure to sunlight to produce vitamin D compared to fair-skinned individuals. So dark-skinned individuals living in high latitudes are likely to develop severe vitamin D deficiency and they are more susceptible to a wide range of apparently unrelated diseases like tuberculosis and hypertension. So at least in Brazil, the sunscreen was launched in 1960, in 1984. So, from that moment on, there were a lot of propaganda trying to make people to avoid any kind of, any minimal exposure to sunlight. And this had two consequences. For instance, if you use a protection factor of 8, that blocks approximately 95% of production of vitamin D.

(10:39) And if you use a factor of 15, then approximately 99% of the continuous production of vitamin D will be blocked. So in addition to that, the second consequence is that sunscreens can contain aluminum hydroxide coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles. And those nanoparticles can penetrate the intact skin. And aluminum is extremely toxic metal. That vitamin D is not actually a vitamin, it&#39;s a steroid hormone. It converts into a hormone in several of human cells and it&#39;s needed by nearly all cells for their functions. Low vitamin D levels play a role in the development of many diseases. So this is the number of just a few examples of diseases that are affected by the level of vitamin D that a person has. And you see it for general human health, you have almost 2 million papers already published. This led us to this publications by Stumpf in 2012, he said that vitamin D is as fundamental as the sun and the closest we have to a panacea.

(12:39) Regarding the immune system, we have more than half a million publications available in Google Scholar. And here is just a slide to demonstrate how important vitamin D is for the immune cells. Suppose that you have immune cells that has phagocyted mycobacterium tuberculosis. So it&#39;s within the cell and the cell has to destroy it. In order to do that, mycobacterium tuberculosis, as any other bacteria, is stimulated as toll-like receptors. And as a consequence of that, messages are sent, chemical messages are sent to the nuclei of immune cells. And this makes immune cells to express the 1-alpha hydroxylase, which turns the 25-hydroxy D to 25-hydroxy D, which is the active form of vitamin D. And this active form of vitamin D stimulates the vitamin D receptor. As a consequence of that, catechins are produced, and these are compounds that destroyed virtually any kind of microorganism that has invaded our body. So we see how important vitamin D is for the immune system. If we don&#39;t have vitamin D, then the bacteria like mycobacterium tuberculosis will remain alive within the immune cells. So if we look for vitamin D and infectious disease, this slide shows that by 2021, there were almost 300,000 peer-reviewed publications on the functions of vitamin D in the immune system. And today, in 2025, we have almost 400 papers published. Infectious disease, you see this large number of publications showing how vitamin D level is important to control all of those infectious diseases. I would like to show you an example of that by presenting Dr. Auguste Rollier. He died in 1954. He was a Swiss physician who treated tuberculosis in the first half of the 1900s, at a time when no effective antibiotics were available to combat that highly contagious chronic disease.

##### TB Sanatoriums

(16:39) And he built up in the Swiss Alps at 2,000 meters above the sea level. He built up 36 edifices with large balconies, as you see here. And he used to treat tuberculosis by exposing his patients to sunlight. And the reason why he had to be 2,000 meters above the sea level is because he wanted to be above the clouds so that he would have sunlight throughout the year. So the treatment consisted of daily escalating solar exposure.

(17:48) His buildings were called sanatoriums. One sanatorium situated in Davos appears in the novel The Magic Mountains by Thomas Mann, who was first published in German in November 1924. This is an example of his results. On the left side of the slide, we observe a four-year-old patient with 34 foci of osteoarthritis, adenitis, like you will see here, numerous ulcers, as this one. I would like you to pay attention to this one, and tuberculomas affecting his right forearm.

(18:50) The patient also presents with advanced tuberculosis affecting both feet, the right hand, the left lung, and the abdomen. We call it peritonitis. He was extremely thin, had a lot of, he had lost a lot of body weight, and at a level that we call cachexia. His lower left shoulder suggests that he had also had rickets, and it&#39;s important to say that rickets, children with rickets frequently died because of tuberculosis, and at some point, some medical doctors thought that tuberculosis and rickets had the same origin. On the right side of the slide, we see the same patient one year later, healing of ulcers, deconstruction of bones, muscles, and the general condition. And you see that ulcer is now healed. At a time when the importance of vitamin D for our immune system was not known, Dr. Joliot credited the success of his treatment to exposure to sunlight and to the pure air of the mountains.

(20:47) The effectiveness of solar exposure in treating tuberculosis is evidenced by the establishment of sanatoriums in various locations worldwide, including the mountain regions of southern Brazil. However, at some point, the sanatoriums were fitted with glass windows and glass blocks the UVB rays, which are required for vitamin D synthesis in the skin. As a result, the sanatoriums ceased treating tuberculosis and were closed at a time when the first antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment, the injectable streptomycin was introduced to the market. Now sanatoriums turned into hotels in the Swiss mountains. So low vitamin D goes to low catalytic synthesis, allowing microbes to remain alive within the immune cells. And that leads us to the Trojan horse mechanism. We see here the structure of the blood-brain barrier,

(22:16) including the astrocytic podocyte, participating in this barrier. And we see that some virus like HIV virus, when you have low levels of vitamin D, they are not destroyed by the immune cells. And when the immune cells penetrate the blood-brain barrier, because they have the mechanism, those cells have the mechanism required for this penetration, it&#39;s carrying virus. So that&#39;s the way when the brain becomes infected by HIV and several other virus probably, like in some types of severe measles and like in polio, you also have the same mechanism. This is called the Trojan horse mechanism because the virus enters the brain within the immune cells. And by doing that, they bypass the blood-brain barrier. In September, 2018, the WHO called for urgent action to end the tuberculosis epidemic. Prior to the COVID epidemic, tuberculosis was the deadliest infectious diseases.

(24:07) It was killing like 2000 people per day worldwide. The combined use of multiple antibiotics to combine the antibiotic resistance has shown limited effectiveness nowadays. So autoimmune, this is an important issue to our protocol. Autoimmune diseases are almost always triggered by stressful life events. And managing emotional stress should be regarded as essential for the success of all therapeutic approaches, not only related to autoimmune diseases, but also to several other diseases. So then we are merged into this vicious cycle when emotional distress leads to reduced magnesium. And as magnesium is required for vitamin D activation, then you have reduced vitamin D activity. And that increases the possibility of acquiring an autoimmune disorder. And when the patient has a chronic disease, has acquired an autoimmune disorder, then this contributes to deepen the emotional distress. So reduced magnesium also causes excessive reaction to daily life problems and increases emotional distress. So this emotional distress disrupts the epigenetic control of dirty genes that we call the SNPs that we all have. We all have dirty genes, but they are usually switched off since prenatal life. And when we have a high level of stress, this in a way switch on those genes. So if you look for autoimmune disorders and stressful life events, we know we today have like more, almost 12,000 papers published. This is an example. Association between stressful life events and autoimmune disorders. Now going to vitamin D and autoimmune diseases, the issue of vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. We have more than 200,000 papers published. And so all those autoimmune diseases have tens of thousands of papers published relating them to low levels of vitamin D. So all the vitamin D works in autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disease is mediated by abnormal immune response, which is called TH17. There are almost 300,000 papers showing that this is the mechanism involved in the origin of autoimmune diseases. And vitamin D inhibits TH17. We have more than 3,000 papers, 3,000 papers showing the property of vitamin D related to inhibition of TH17. You see, it suppresses the TH17 cytokine production. This slide is to review the metabolism of vitamin D within immune cells. Vitamin D, cholecal sepharol is hydroxylated in the liver and released in the circulation. So vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-D enters the cell, undergoes a second hydroxylation within immune cells and the resulting 125-hydroxy-D stimulates a VDR, vitamin D receptor that inhibits TH17 programs and stimulates the proliferation of TH17. regulatory T cells. Okay, this is the same slide. So vitamin D and TH17, as I told you, we have like more than 30,000 publications. And how we adjust the dose of vitamin D. Here we have the parathyroid cells, a cell of one of the four parathyroid glands that we have close to our thyroid gland. And the vitamin D that is activated in the liver also enters the parathyroid cells. It&#39;s activated and simulate as VDR and the simulation of VDR by the active form of vitamin D inhibits the production of PTH, parathyroid hormone. So what we do in order to match the level of resistance that a person has to vitamin D is to measure PTH before the treatment and after five months of treatment. So when we increase PTH, when we increase vitamin D, PTH decreases and the goal is to decrease PTH to just above the lower level of the reference range for PTH. So PTH inhibition has two advantages as concerned to our protocol using high doses of vitamin D. It shows the level of individual resistance to vitamin D. And if PTH is not decreased below the lower level of the reference range, then this assures safety. It means that we are pretty sure that there will be no intoxication. Intoxication meaning increased level of calcium.

##### Vitamin D Resistance

(32:45) Before we go on, are you going to talk a little bit more about what vitamin D resistance is? 

Patients who have autoimmune disorders, they have polymorphic changes affecting any combination of the nine genes that is required for vitamin D effects.

(33:35) So we don&#39;t know the level of resistance that a specific patient may have. So we have to test it. So we give a testing dose that could be something like 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And so vitamin D starts increasing and it takes like three, four or five months to level off. So we measure PTH before starting vitamin D, the supplements with high doses of vitamin D and after five months. So at the end of this five months, we see how much vitamin D, when we increased vitamin D, how much PTH decreased. That was what I was trying to show you when I showed this. Suppose that this is the level of PTH that you have before the treatment, before taking 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And this is the level of PTH that you have five months later. So it should be just above the lower level of the reference range. If it has decreased below that level, so I have to decrease the daily dose of vitamin D. If it is far above the lower level of the reference range, so I still have to give more vitamin D as compared to what I was giving during this period of test, okay? So the first six months is like a testing period. We give a testing dose and we see how much the level of, I mean, how much the level of PTH will decrease. So at the end of these five months periods, when we receive the patients in a second appointment, then I look at the level of PTH and I have to calculate how much PTH, how much vitamin D, how much vitamin D I have to give in addition to that previous dose or how much vitamin D I have to decrease as compared to that previous dose. I don&#39;t know if I explained myself properly. Well, if you wouldn&#39;t mind going back to one of the slides that shows the immune cell.

(36:52) One of my favorite presentations of yours was a presentation you did in Germany and you showed these slides that explained visually what happens like regarding the vitamin D resistance and why that leads to a decreased activity of vitamin D or a decreased response to vitamin D so that the more vitamin D resistance there is in an individual, the less vitamin D activity there is and the more vitamin D they&#39;ll need to overcome that vitamin D resistance. 

(38:11) So this is one of my first patients that I treated. She had SLE, and that was the result of only 10,000 units

(39:02) of vitamin D per day after six months of treatment. So you imagine how impressed I was because that was the only change. The only change that I did in her treatment was to add vitamin D, 10,000 units per day. So you see her right face here, the difference between before and after the treatment, the left face. So here you see another patient with psoriasis. You see the psoriasis lesions affecting this area of her face.

(39:55) And after six months taking 10,000 units of vitamin D, of vitamin D, you see this benefit that she had. You see the difference giving her 10,000 units of vitamin D within, after six months, you see how improved the lesions were. So this is the same patient. So here you have patients with multiple sclerosis. And she was born in 1982. And this is when she had the first flare of multiple sclerosis. So this MRI was taken in March 14.

(40:56) And you see those lesions, those were recent lesions because it was her first flare. Okay, it&#39;s important to say that because vitamin D has also effects on the cells that produce myelin, which is called oligodendrocytes. So it promotes remyelination in multiple sclerosis. But that remyelination only occurs when you have recent lesions. When you have lesions that are older than one year, back when you start the treatment.

(41:43) So it&#39;s more difficult to have remyelination of lesions. But that provides a comparison between March 2011 and July, 2012. More than one year had elapsed between one MRI and another. This lesions, those lesions were active in the first set of MRIs. I&#39;m not showing you this here, but they were making up a contrast. So you see here another patient who had a lesion, MS lesion affecting a critical area of the brain.

(42:49) This lesion can cause severe symptoms and disability. It was a patient born in 1989. The first slide was taken, the first slide is on the MRI made in April 18, 2011. And the second slide was done about two years later, more than two years later. And you see the disappearance of that lesion. It was also a recent lesion. There were kind of lesions, old lesions here who had lesions, not so old lesions, but you see that maybe the spinal cord is a little bit swollen because of some lesions were present here, but they also had disappeared two and a half years later. So this is a severe type of multiple sclerosis. It&#39;s called Malon concentric sclerosis. It&#39;s a severe disease related to multiple sclerosis. Usually patients do not survive for more than two or three years after the diagnosis. And you see the first MRI that was taken in October, 2008.

(44:30) And there were several MRIs in between, but like five years later, you only have the scar of those lesions and no additional lesion. So that was impressive to me. I was impressed with that case because as a neurologist, I know how Malon concentric sclerosis is a severe disease. So this slide is to show why we should not use the active form of vitamin D to treat those patients. So colicalciferol, which is the form of vitamin D that we give to patients orally, goes to the liver, undergoes the first hydroxylation, turning it into 25-hydroxy-D. This increase in 25-hydroxy-D has no effect, does not inhibit the 25-hydroxylase located in the liver. So the 25-hydroxy-D goes to kidney and to immune cells like mycophages, and you&#39;ll find one alpha hydroxylase in both sites in both cells. So they turned one alpha hydroxylase into a drug they turn in the 25-hydroxy-D into the active form of vitamin D. The kidney releases into the circulation, the blood serum, but the immune cells like mycophages use this active form of vitamin D to supply its needs. So it&#39;s not supposed to release in the circulation. So when one 25-hydroxy-D is released in the circulation, it inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. And this is an important step to prevent intoxication because the one 25-hydroxy-D is capable of increasing calcium levels to a very high level. So we should avoid having that. And when we give a cholecalciferol, you see that when the kidneys release the one 25-hydroxy-D, the one 25-hydroxy-D released in the circulation inhibits the renal enzyme. So one 25-hydroxy-D go to the intestines and bones and it releases calcium in the circulation and the release of calcium in the circulation further inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. But this has no, calcium level has no effect in the one alpha hydroxylase located in the immune cells. So that&#39;s the reason why we should use a cholecalciferol and not never use a one 25-hydroxy-D because if you use one 25-hydroxy-D, you will bypass all this controlling homeostatic mechanisms that this does not happen when you use cholecalciferol. So this is something important. It shows how one alpha hydroxylase works both in the kidneys and in immune cells and in several other tissues like the brain, placenta and several other tissues. So the reduced form of one alpha hydroxylase is capable of synthesizing one 25-hydroxy-D but it requires magnesium as a cofactor. But when it turns 25-hydroxy-D, D into 125-hydroxy-D, it gets oxidized. So in the oxidized form, one alpha hydroxylase cannot pick up another molecule of 25-hydroxy-D to turn it into the active form of vitamin D.

(50:24) So it has to go back to the reduced form. This enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, comprising like more than 100 enzymes. And this family of enzymes have an auxiliary enzyme that is called reductase of the cytochrome P450. And this enzyme requires both the active forms of vitamin B2 as a prosthetic group. And it&#39;s capable of reducing the oxidized one alpha hydroxylase. When this occurs, the reductase is oxidized, but it is capable of reducing itself back to the reduced form of cytochrome P450 reductase. So this cycle has to go on, but in order for this cycle to go on, you need this cycle to go on. So in order to keep hydroxylating vitamin D to the active form, you need magnesium and vitamin B2. And it&#39;s important to know that like 10 to 15% of the world population has reduced the ability to absorb riboflavin. Several of those people have autoimmune disorders.

(52:37) This was demonstrated by this article published in 1994. So this is extremely important to me because it&#39;s like 10% of the world population. It&#39;s important to say that high doses of colic alcephalol should be taken under the supervision of an experienced physician to avoid harm and renal function. 

Real quickly, Dr. Coimbra, can you just define what high doses?  Because some people consider high dose the 10,000 IU a day.

(53:20) Is that the dose that you&#39;re talking about? Or are you talking about the doses that you use in your protocol, the 1,000 IU per kilogram, correct? Yes. Okay, 10,000 units per day is an amount of vitamin D that you can produce by solar exposure. So nobody has ever got intoxicated with vitamin D by exposing the skin to sunlight. So if you are lying down on horizontal position, you have a fair skin and the sun is high enough, your skin is a young skin, then you can produce this amount of vitamin D within like 20 minutes or 30 minutes. So it&#39;s hard to believe that people still believe that 10,000 units of vitamin D is a high dose of vitamin D considering that this is easily produced by exposing the skin to sunlight. So when I&#39;m talking about high doses of vitamin D, I&#39;m talking about the doses that we give to patients initially, which is 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. So this is a high dose. And maybe it could be called a therapeutic dose because it&#39;s what you&#39;re using to help treat these patients and not necessarily what somebody in the general population might take just to maintain their vitamin D levels. Never, the general population should not take this high dose of vitamin D. Only patients who have autoimmune disorders and under medical supervision.

(55:41) I&#39;m glad we clarified that because the therapeutic use is a use that should be used with a medical device provider who is observing and watching for toxicity and measuring the PTH and all of that. I just wanted to make that clear. So I&#39;m gonna let you go ahead and keep moving forward. Okay. When we give high doses of vitamin D, I was talking about the initial dose of 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day.

(56:22) This is usually our testing dose for diseases like, say, rheumatoid arthritis, to see how much the PTH will decrease when we increase the dose of vitamin D. But if I am treating a disease like psoriasis, I don&#39;t have to start giving that amount of vitamin D. I can give, say, for a patient who weights like 50 kilograms, I can give like 13,000 or 40,000 units per day as a testing dose because it&#39;s not an emergency, okay?

(57:12) But that changes when I have an emergency. For instance, if I have a patient with multiple sclerosis who is having a severe disease, I can give that amount of vitamin D per day. For instance, who is at risk of losing his vision because of optical neuritis or just had an episode of optical neuritis like two weeks ago and is coming for the first appointment. So this is, to me, this is an emergency because I know that if I give high doses and I immediately increase the dose of vitamin D, the level of vitamin D to a high level, I know that I can reverse the visual loss that this patient has. So in this case, I would give to this patient a low dose of vitamin D. And what I&#39;m going to tell you has been published. If I don&#39;t, probably it was published by a group of Italian researchers in 2018. They showed if you give 600 milligrams of vitamin D or 600,000 units of vitamin D as a single dose orally, on day three, the patient will have a level of vitamin D which is around 18 nanograms per ml. And that, it means that I will normalize the level of vitamin D immediately by giving this loading dose. So, but I will not give this loading dose to a patient that comes for the first appointment and has only psoriasis. There is no emergency in that situation. I can check the level of resistance to that patient six months later and adjust the dose.

(59:53) There&#39;s no rush in increasing the dose of vitamin D immediately. But in a patient in that situation, who had a flare of multiple sclerosis affecting his optical nerve, then I may give him this loading dose. I will definitely give him this loading dose because I don&#39;t want to miss the therapeutical window to reverse his visual disabilities. I need a high level of vitamin D to be achieved immediately so that I can get the effects of vitamin D in terms of remyelination of the optical nerve. Is that clear enough? So the initial dose may vary according to the patient&#39;s condition and to the type of disease that he is having. But we can have intoxication of vitamin D because using high doses of vitamin D because patients should follow a strict diet. They should not have dairy products in their diet and order diet items that have high level of calcium. So they have to follow this strict calcium diet.

##### Urinary Tract Infections

(1:01:40) And sometimes they just, they&#39;re doing so well that they just don&#39;t feel that this is important and they don&#39;t follow the diet strictly as they were recommended to. So one of the causes of intoxication is an unreliable source of vitamin D. Another cause of intoxication is urinary tract infections, particularly pyelonephritis, nephritis, nephritis. For some reason, when you have a urinary tract infection, even if you are not taking vitamin D, any supplement of vitamin D, your calcium level may increase.

(1:02:43) For some, there is a mechanism by which urinary tract infection decreases the urinary elimination of calcium. So it&#39;s an important part of the protocol is to prevent urinary tract infections. And because urinary tract infections are caused by microorganisms that are present in our feces, it&#39;s extremely important and extremely effective to wash the perianal area after having a bowel movement so that you remove all microorganisms from that area.

(1:03:47) Sometimes we may, for some patients who have recurrent urinary tract infections, after washing that area, they have to apply a topic antibiotic after washing that area. So poor compliance with dietary calcium restriction is another possible cause of intoxication. Hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, like in Basildo-Reeves disease or nodules in the thyroid gland that produce high levels, high amounts of thyroid hormones.

(1:04:45) This condition can, when it&#39;s associated with high doses of vitamin D, can lead to intoxication. And this is because thyroid hormones, just like vitamin D, they may remove calcium from our bones and the patient get intoxicated, not because of the calcium in their diets, but because of large amounts of calcium that are released in their bones in that condition. So if we have a patient with Graves&#39; disease, first we have to control the Graves&#39; disease by using proper medications that decrease the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. So it&#39;s extremely important to have hyperthyroidism under control before starting this treatment. Basildo-Reeves is autoimmune disorder and responds to high doses of vitamin D, but we cannot start high doses of vitamin D without controlling the release of large amounts of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland.

##### With high-dose Vitamin D need to avoid high-dose vitamin C, Lithium supplements

(1:06:25) So we found, this is for experiences, that when patients are taking very high doses of vitamin C, they may get intoxicated. And high doses of vitamin D, very high doses of vitamin C, reduce a kind of a situation called systemic oxalosis. So we advise patients under this treatment to avoid supplements of vitamin C higher than 250 milligrams per day. So we also found that lithium, this drug that is used in psychiatry, lithium can induce hyperparathyroidism.

(1:07:25) So it can increase the release of PTH in parathyroid hormones, and this can cause intoxication. So if you are at the same time using a high dose of vitamin D and you have a high level of PTH because you are taking lithium, and lithium increases the release of PTH by parathyroid hormones. 

So the use of lithium can cause intoxication when we are using this protocol. Real quick about vitamin C. Is it only vitamin C from supplements, or do you also have to worry about vitamin C from foods?

(1:08:33) Only from supplements. Patients can take as much vitamin C as they want by taking fruits and other foods like that. It&#39;s impossible to have very high levels of vitamin C taking those foods. No possible. Okay. And then can you clarify, because I thought you said supplements containing 250 milligrams of vitamin C, or was that 250,000 milligrams of vitamin C? Did I say 250? I believe so. No, please. It&#39;s 250 milligrams of vitamin C.

(1:09:22) Just to correct that. Patients should not take more than 250 milligrams of vitamin C per day as a supplement, but they can take any fruit containing vitamin C that will not cause any problem to our protocol. 

##### Calcium levels, hydration, Magnesium

Okay. Thank you. So we also found that but these inhibitors can cause, can increase calcium levels. But at this point, I don&#39;t know the mechanism related to that. But we found that once someone, some patients started using those aromatase inhibitors for prevention of breast cancer, some of those patients got intoxicated with vitamin D. I mean, their calcium levels increased above the normal range. So we have a, I don&#39;t know if you would like to go through those steps, but we have a protocol. When intoxication happens, we have a protocol to use in order to induce a recovery from intoxication. Maybe it&#39;s not interesting to go into those steps. Let&#39;s go through it because we might have some practitioners who are interested in learning more and maybe even reaching out to you for training. Patients who are under this treatment, should be aware of symptoms of increasing calcium levels, such as persistent nausea and constipation. When that happens, they should stop taking not only nausea, isolated nausea or isolated constipation. But when the two symptoms are associated, then they should be concerned about the possibility of having high levels of calcium, circulating calcium. So the first measure is to stop taking vitamin D and all other supplements that we give to those patients, except for magnesium. This is important because magnesium is a natural calcium blocker. And it&#39;s important to keep the intake of magnesium supplements and sometimes even to increase that dose. So they have to increase the daily hydration for one more liter, because usually when the patients start on that treatment, we ask them to take at least 2.5 liters of liquids in general per day. But in that situation, when those two symptoms are associated, then we ask them to increase the daily hydration to at least 3.5 liters per day. So we doubled the daily amount of magnesium that we use in this protocol. We usually use a hundred milligrams of elemental magnesium three or four times per day.

##### Furosemide, alendronate, bifosfonate also given

(1:13:35) And we have to double that amount. As another step, we start using furosemide, which is a diuretic drug, 40 milligrams. One tablet twice a day for one week and then reduced to once a week. We start supplementation of potassium to avoid the side effect of furosemide, 100 milligrams, one tablet twice a day for one week and then reduced to once a week. We also give them alendronate, bifosfonate, because bifosfonate immediately blocks the release of calcium from the patient&#39;s bones. And it&#39;s important to say that patients usually get intoxicated because of the calcium, the amount of the large amount of calcium that they are releasing from their bone tissue and not because of the diet. Usually it&#39;s not because of the diet, because you are usually following the diet. So giving bifosfonate is a way to stop the intoxication immediately because you stop the releasing of calcium from the bones.

##### Weekly lab tests

(1:15:19) So we ask patients to collect blood and urine samples once a week as prescribed and they are sending those results to us as soon as the results are available. This is different as compared to what happens in US because who receives the laboratory results in US seems to be the doctor. In Brazil, patients and doctors have access to laboratory results. In summary, that&#39;s what we do when we have a case of intoxication and all doctors that have been trained in our clinic are taught to use this protocol as part of their training. So those are the lab tests that we use whenever we have a case of intoxication. We order paratormon, obviously if the paratormon is above the lower limit of the normal range, the patient is not intoxicated because when calcium increases above the, it&#39;s upper level, upper level of normal range, when calcium is increasing, is increased, it inhibits the release of paratormon by parathyroid glands. So total and ionized calcium are one of the, those four items are blood tests and urinary tests that we always order in order to treat intoxications. TSH is also included here because of course, we want to know if the cause of intoxication is hyperparathyroidism that may begin at some point. So we also order urinary culture, culture of urine to assess sensitivity of antibiotics and we start antibiotics as soon as we receive a positive urine test, urine culture. 

So this is related to your question. Can we pause for a moment and go back? And can you answer the question for me? Is vitamin D toxicity once the patient has shown symptoms, is, are all of those effects completely reversible or are there any permanent, is there any permanent damage from the vitamin D toxicity that these patients experience?

(1:19:11) If we start the treatment of, to reduce, to stop intoxication immediately, then everything is reversed. All damage to kidneys is maybe reversed. If we take a long time to start to do those, that detoxification protocol, then it might, the patient may have some damage to his renal function. But that&#39;s why we are deeply concerned about having the patients are aware that they should let us know. as soon as they are having those symptoms. And we gave them laboratory prescriptions.

(1:20:12) I mean, laboratory orders to so that they have laboratory orders to immediately collect the blood samples as soon as those symptoms started. Right. Okay. So this is something that we always give patients laboratory orders without a date, so that they can use it whenever they want, as it&#39;s necessary. Even before they contact us, they may start measuring calcium levels in their urine, because the urine, the calcium, the urinary calcium level is the first to increase. So if the urinary calcium is within the normal range, then it&#39;s unlikely that this patient has, is intoxicated with the vitamin D. And you also mentioned that the calcium usually comes from the bones. Do you ever see any effect on the bone health with this protocol? Yes. And this is an important question. When we increase, when we give a dose of vitamin D, like 10,000 units of vitamin D, you may expect to have increased the absorption of calcium to your bones. When you increase the dose of vitamin D to more than 20,000 units per day, then the effect on bones is both increasing the absorption of calcium, the assimilation of osteoblasts, and also the increase in the release of calcium from the bones due to the assimilation of osteoclasts. So at some point, you have both assimilation of osteoclasts and assimilation of osteoblasts.

##### Physical exercise is needed to prevent bone loss (people in wheelchairs take a drug)

(1:22:43) And if you increase the dose of vitamin D further, like more than 40,000 units of vitamin D, you will increase, you will stimulate osteoclasts more than you will simulate osteoblasts. So the release of calcium will be increased in those patients. And in order to prevent that, the best measure to prevent that is to do physical exercise. Because if you have strong muscles, you have strong bones. You cannot have weak bones if you have strong muscles.

(1:23:36) This is the way that nature works. If you submit your bones to forces during physical exercise, like musculation, to increase the muscle mass, you will also increase the calcium level, calcium concentration in your bones. So it&#39;s extremely important. It&#39;s part of our protocol. Patients cannot remain at home just taking high doses of vitamin D. They have to do physical exercises. And I ask them to do physical exercises every day, especially those exercises that are  related to hip muscles. They are simulated to do that every single day, maybe twice a day, if possible, twice a day. And this is extremely effective to prevent the loss of calcium from the bone tissue. Is that what you were asking? Yes. An additional information. Okay. Some patients cannot do physical exercise because they are in a wheelchair for several years. They are in a situation of irreversible damage to their spinal cord, even years before they started this treatment. So I can ask them to do physical exercise. So in that case, I have to use medications that will stop the release of calcium from their bones at the same time when I started giving them a higher level of vitamin D. And it&#39;s something extremely important in regarding that question. 

##### Stress and mental health

Is this when we started paying attention to the to the mental health of our patients, meaning when we started to ask them, asking them to control their emotions by controlling their thoughts, because you are under stress because of the thoughts that you are accepting in your mind because of the problems that you are facing. But if you learn techniques on how to control your thoughts as a way to control your stress, I can see that those patients do not require those high levels of vitamin D. And I see in the in the laboratory tests that I have to decrease the level of vitamin D, the doses of vitamin D, because they seem to be no longer so resistant to vitamin D as they were before. And this, that&#39;s why the control of emotions has become the basic of this, this therapy. I don&#39;t want to keep patients on high doses of vitamin D forever. I want to decrease their daily doses of vitamin D. And I can decrease their daily doses of vitamin D if they decrease the level of stress. So this is part of the treatment.

(1:28:05) I have several patients that are no longer taking high doses of vitamin D because they learned how to control their emotions. So techniques like mindfulness are very important to those patients. And we ask them to look for information like that. And I don&#39;t know if I could transmit how important this is for this protocol. It&#39;s not about giving them high dose, only about giving high doses of vitamin D to match the level of resistance. This can be the first step.

##### Stress, inflammation decrease in about a month

(1:28:50) But as time goes by, the patient is now aware that he is not, he is no longer having those symptoms that he had before. And one of the most important symptoms is fatigue, fatigue at rest. Fatigue at rest almost disappeared after one month of treatment. And this is a way of measuring the strength of an inflammatory, a systemic inflammatory condition. A systemic inflammatory conditions cause fatigue at rest.

(1:29:40) So if this is decreased after one, one month of treatment, I know that the inflammation, inflammatory process is becoming under control. And that&#39;s a question that I consistently ask to all patients. What&#39;s your level of fatigue in a scale from zero to 10? Because when they come back, I will ask that question again. Another question that I ask patients is something like this. Suppose there is a scale, an imaginary scale of stress that goes from zero to 10.

(1:30:33) Zero does not exist, would be someone that does not get stressed for anything. So that does not exist. But a level five would be the average level of stress that a person of the, an average person of the population has. And a person that is facing common problems, irregular problems, ordinary problems. And level 10 is the maximum level of stress that a patient may have, that someone may experience. So I ask the patient, what&#39;s your level of stress?

(1:31:22) And it&#39;s unbelievable. There is no patients that were happy, calm and happy when they got sick. It&#39;s unbelievable. And when they got sick, they were facing a stressful life event that was much higher than the stressful life event that they used to face in their lives. So when they start, when they have the first appointment, this is another question that I ask right now, what is your level of stress in that scale from zero to 10?

(1:32:09) Because when they come back, I&#39;ll ask them again to see if they could decrease the level of stress. And if they could not decrease the level of stress, I will reinforce the importance of this in order to live a normal life without having to take high doses of vitamin D. This is a really good point and important to know about the Coimbra Protocol, that it&#39;s not just about giving very high therapeutic doses of vitamin D.

(1:32:46) It&#39;s adjusting lifestyle in terms of exercise, emotional health and diet. And all of those, wow, wow. So you can actually get them off of the therapeutic vitamin D if they can control their stress. That&#39;s pretty phenomenal. 

Yes, they can. But sometimes there are patients that are unable to control their stress no matter how much you talk about. But we are always trying in every appointment. And I would say that most patients are now realizing how important this is for the success of the treatment. 

Do you utilize any other nutrients or interventions to specifically address stress for those individuals who have a hard time just controlling their mind and behavior? Magnesium itself has this effect. What was it? Magnesium itself has this effect. So the dose of magnesium is adjusted according to the maximum dose that a patient can have and take without having diarrhea.

##### Magnesium types – 100 mg 3X per day

(1:34:12) So it&#39;s important to say that some magnesium salts are not suitable for any treatment like that. For instance, magnesium oxide cause a lot of diarrhea should never be used as a magnesium supplement for those reasons. Because most of the magnesium oxide are not absorbed. They remain in the bowels, within the bowels and high level, high concentrations of magnesium in the bowels cause diarrhea. So we use other types of magnesium compounds

(1:35:01) like magnesium glycine, magnesium glycine, magnesium threonate. Do you use citrate or? No, I don&#39;t use citrate because citrate increases the absorption of aluminum in our food. So aluminum is a terrible metal, so I don&#39;t use citrate. So citrate is avoided and magnesium oxide is avoided, should be avoided. And we adjust the dose, as I told you, we adjust the dosing according to the bowel movements. The patient should be having bowel movements every day

(1:36:05) at least once a day, but without diarrhea. If they are not having bowel movements every day, they should increase the dose of magnesium. If they have diarrhea, they should decrease the dose of magnesium. So magnesium is given as within multi-vitamin supplement that I give the patients, but just the basic daily dose of magnesium, which should be around 100 milligrams of magnesium three to four times per day within that polyvitamin compound.

(1:37:00) But I give an additional magnesium to adjust the dose according to the bowel movements. So, the literature related to magnesium supplementation says that you have to adjust the dose according to bowel movements, okay? So I think that this is really important to say that some other supplements can reduce stress. One of the supplements that can reduce stress is glycine. Glycine is amino acid and it can reduce stress.

(1:37:50) So we used to use magnesium glycine as a preferential form of magnesium. But if I want to have more effects in the central nervous system, I might use magnesium trionate. If I want to increase the release of, if I want to detoxify aluminum, aluminum today is a major, major concern of ours in this protocol, because we are seeing a lot of patients with problems related to aluminum. But we can get back to this subject in a while if you want.

(1:38:55)  I had a few other questions about other co-nutrients, but I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re already planning on getting there. For example, you talked about the B2, you&#39;ve also mentioned omega-3s, and then a lot of people ask about vitamin K, and there&#39;s questions about vitamin A. So if you want to save those for later. 

(1:39:28) Well, let me rewind a little bit and ask you, because I think there&#39;s a misconception that taking very high doses, or just high doses, not even therapeutic doses of vitamin D can induce deficiency of another nutrient. But the way that I like to refer to it, or several of our other scientists have referred to it is that correcting vitamin D deficiency vitamin D deficiency and taking that 10,000 IU of vitamin D a day as the high dose simply reveals inadequacies of other related nutrients. So it&#39;s not necessarily causing another nutrient such as magnesium or any of the B vitamins to become deficient. It&#39;s just showing that the intake is already too low to support normal function. Would you agree with that? Or are there any specific nutrients that you also concern yourself with when you&#39;re putting your patients on higher vitamin D? Well, I try to increase the capacity of fighting inflammation in my patients.

##### Omega-3 Three times a day

(1:40:57) So the omega-3 that you have mentioned is part of our protocol. So we give them omega-3, high concentrated omega-3 three times a day as part of our protocol. So they will produce their own anti-inflammatory substances. Regarding vitamin K2, 15 years ago, we tried to give vitamin K2 as MK7 to try to prevent loss of calcium in the bones of patients under high doses of vitamin D under our protocol.

(1:41:58) But it was useless, this did not work. So it only made the protocol more expensive. So I gave up using vitamin K2. When you didn&#39;t see any buildup of calcium in the arteries or any other tissues that it wasn&#39;t supposed to be? If you keep the calcium level, circulating calcium level within the normal range, there is no reason to be concerned about calcification of tissues. Tissues may calcificate if you have high levels of calcium in your circulation.

(1:42:45) So I try, I keep the level of calcium within the normal range by using the diet and other measures, but I don&#39;t use vitamin K2. I understood that it was useless. It did not change anything, laboratory tests, bone mass were not changing. 

##### Do you put all of your patients on B2 and other B vitamins? And for how long?

Well, as I showed you, like 10% of the world population cannot absorb vitamin B2  properly. So I keep this high dose, a high dose of riboflavin, which could be something between 50 milligrams to a hundred milligrams, three or four times per day, to make sure that all those patients who have problems related to their absorption of vitamin B2 will have the benefit of receiving vitamin B2 in the larger doses that would overcome their poor ability, poor absorption, intestinal absorption of vitamin B2.

(1:44:54) It&#39;s so important for that reason that I showed you in another slide, vitamin B2, the two forms of vitamin B2 is required for that auxiliary enzyme that is necessary for the function of the vitamin D hydroxylases. So this is something important, magnesium and vitamin B2 should be given to all our patients, at least those two additional supplements, but we also give omega-3, high concentration omega-3, and I think that&#39;s it.

(1:45:51) Would you like to ask about any other supplements? Well, I was curious if you give any of the other B vitamins or if you ever adjust, I recently interviewed Dr. Stasia Gomenek about her protocol. 

She&#39;s also a- Okay, I also give them, that&#39;s important, I also give them methylfolate and vitamin B12. Because lots of those patients have abnormalities related to folate cycle. And folate cycle is important for such a large amount of functions, biochemical reactions in our organism, including the production of glutathione. So we depend on a good folate cycle to produce glutathione, which is the main antioxidant mechanism in our organism, the main antioxidant defense in our organism. So I try to provide vitamin B12 and methylfolate, never use folic acid, folic acid should never be used, should never be administered to any patient, because like 30% of the whole population will have problems related to the administration of folic acid. Folic acid is not the normal vitamin B9 that is available in nature. It&#39;s produced by pharmaceutical companies as folate that is resistant to heat, but it should not be given to the whole population. No, and because like 30% of the whole population, the whole world population may have problems related to SNPs, related to folate metabolism, I always give them a methylfolate. 

So it sounds like you are, you individualize treatment to your patient&#39;s specific needs. You adjust the co-nutrients according to your patient&#39;s individual needs. 

##### Folate helps eliminate aluminum (a major health problem)

Yes, I do. But your question is very important. I am always concerned to keep myself in a good state of folate metabolism, which is demonstrated by homocysteine levels. And it&#39;s a major factor related to the elimination, detoxification of metals like aluminum. Aluminum is a major, perhaps the major health problem worldwide. I&#39;m not exaggerating. What I&#39;m seeing is impressive. Yeah, and we&#39;ll talk more about that a little bit later, especially. as it relates to autism. Do you, so you only measure the homocysteine to get an idea of the B vitamins, SNPs, or do you ever do any genetic testing? I measure homocysteine, especially in, in people who are, who are older than 40 years old. But since I started treating pediatric patients with, with autism, ASD, I was impressed to see that some of them have high levels of homocysteine. And the high homocysteine is related to which B vitamins? Is it just the folate, or is it also B12, or explain a little bit. Maybe related to B12 and B9. B9 is the methylfolate. But you see, vitamin B2 also plays a role in those folate cycles. And magnesium also plays a role.

(1:51:25) So giving magnesium, giving vitamin B2 is giving, giving vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 in the form of methylfolate are important items of our protocol. Just a couple more questions on this topic, because the microbiome is an important piece in our overall health as well, especially when we&#39;re talking about autism. Do you ever address the microbiome as part of your protocols? And I believe if you&#39;ve got a healthy microbiome, your gut can actually produce a lot of these B vitamins. I&#39;m especially concerned about that when I treat patients with ASD. But in all patients, I advise them to have a healthy diet that will, because if your food is related to the type of microorganisms that you have in your bowels, right? In your intestines. So I suggest them to decrease as much as possible the amount of meat that they are eating and change the source of proteins to vegetable sources of proteins and eggs. If this is not sufficient, then try to use fish or other type of meat. And sometimes, yes, I do supplement those patients with probiotics. It&#39;s a major concern of ours. 

##### Added Vitamin A to increase cellular Vitamin D

 **[Not confirmed by AI March 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-vitamin-a-increase-the-am-pszR9Zz3RWWBznPueNV9Jw)** 

One more question about other nutrients, because there are certain groups that believe taking high doses of vitamin D can deplete your vitamin A. Do you ever concern yourself with vitamin A? As you are asking questions,

(1:53:51) I am reviewing what I&#39;m doing. Yes, I told you that- Boiler alert. Yes, you remember that I told you that I give patients a compound of vitamins and vitamin A is included to that because in order to vitamin D has its actions at the level of **vitamin D receptor**  within the nucleus, vitamin A will be required. So this is also added to our supplement of vitamin A like 500 micrograms three times per day is part of our protocol nowadays.

(1:54:46) Maybe several years ago it was not, but now it is. Okay, and we&#39;re talking retinol, right? Not the beta carotene, the precursors. Sorry? We&#39;re talking the preformed vitamin A, correct? Yes. Yes, okay. All right, so just to kind of wrap this little part up, when we&#39;re talking, you know, quote high doses of vitamin D is in no more than 10,000 IU a day. Do we need to concern ourselves if, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don&#39;t have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? 

Well, will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we&#39;ve just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight. Well, orally though, it&#39;s a little bit different. You know, our body&#39;s got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce. And it&#39;s, you know, produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they&#39;ve heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now. And I did not have that kind of problems in any patients, and you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So, I&#39;m really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use, and that&#39;s it. 

Okay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four, or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1,000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1,000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine, recommends only 600 units per day, and this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter, and this is completely normal. You can&#39;t have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, by higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, but it&#39;s still no, it&#39;s still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.

Therefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve its biological effect effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. 

##### COVID 600,000 IU of Vitamin D

As I told you, in case of an emergency, like during an epidemic, or the pandemic that we experienced a few years ago, an initial dose of 600,000 units of vitamin D should be given orally, and depending on the body weight of that person, it should, it could be repeated in the next day to achieve the desirable level of 80 nanograms per ml immediately, because it&#39;s an emergency. Well, I thought, I already told you that I also considered an emergency patient with MS.

###### - - - - -Must add about 120 minutes to the times after this point

(00:06) If, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don&#39;t have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? Will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we&#39;ve just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight.

(00:35) Well, orally, though, it&#39;s a little bit different. You know, our body&#39;s got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce, and it&#39;s produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they&#39;ve heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now, and I did not have that kind of problems in any patients. And you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So I&#39;m really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use. And that&#39;s it. Thank you. 

All right. Well, I&#39;ll let you carry on with your presentation. Thank you so much. 

Welcome. So do you see that slide? Okay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine recommends only 600 units per day.

(02:41) And this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter. And this is completely normal. You can&#39;t have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day. But it&#39;s still no, it&#39;s still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.

(04:32) Therefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve this, its biological effect, effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. As I told you, in case of an emergency, like during an epidemic or the pandemic that we experienced a few years ago, an initial dose of 600,000 units of vitamin D should be given orally. And depending on the body weight of that person, it could be repeated in the next day to achieve the desirable level of 80 nanograms per ml immediately, because it&#39;s an emergency. Well, I already told you that I also considered an emergency patient with MS who is at risk of blindness, and then because of optical neurites. And we also treat patients with other kinds, other autoimmune disorders that may lead to blindness, like oviitis, for instance. We also give nine doses of vitamin D to those patients, and I might give a loading dose like that to those patients. So this is a way of classifying patients or classifying their situation as an emergency or not. So if it&#39;s an emergency, we have to use high doses of vitamin D. So, but I would like to to emphasize this, 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, only a minor change in the level of vitamin D as compared to someone who takes zero units per day. Zero units per day. And the IOM advised 600 units per day. So we see that this is an absurd, and I don&#39;t understand how this advice has remained for so many years, in spite of those publications like that, repeated publications. So the importance of vitamin D in pregnancy. I saw that this was one of your questions, and it&#39;s one of my main concern also. Vitamin D has numerous effects in pregnancy.

(08:20) It&#39;s sufficient to say, as a preliminary information, that vitamin D is activated in the placenta, both in the maternal side of the placenta and in the fetal side of placenta. The placenta expresses that one alpha hydroxylase enzyme that turns vitamin D into 25-hydroxidine into the active form 125-hydroxidine. And this has microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. It will prevent a miscarriage due to autoimmune aggression against the fetal tissues.

##### 7,000 IU of Vitamin D daily during pregnancy reduces the risk of many offspring health problems

(09:23) So the same article that I was mentioning here by Liu and Hewson also showed all those situations that you may have if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. And I would emphasize the maternal-fetal HIV transfer, autism, multiple sclerosis. just later on in this individual life. Type, the risk of diabetes in childhood if the mother had low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy, and asthma. And all those complications in pregnancy, you may have, if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. So you can imagine how much problems you may, the number, the amazing number of problems that you can prevent by just giving a pregnant woman an amount of 7,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is completely safe. It&#39;s important to say that some of our patients, MS patients, for instance, who were unable to get pregnant when they started receiving high doses of vitamin D, they got pregnant within a few months. So, and you have vitamin D and fertility, you have like more than 70,000 papers published related to that. As a neurologist, I&#39;m really concerned about fetal brain development. And I see that patients who are having 7,000 to 10,000 units or even high doses of vitamin D, as we use in our protocol, the neurodevelopment of those children are amazing. It&#39;s amazing, amazing.

##### Children born of parent with high vitamin D have high IQs, are happier, etc.

(12:09) They are not only have a high IQ, they are happy child, children. It&#39;s amazing, they are completely different to (other) children. So, I&#39;m always wondering what will happen with humankind when the advice of giving 10,000 or at least 7,000 units of vitamin D during pregnancy, what will happen with humanity? Because we&#39;ll have a completely different kind of human beings, as I have seen during this 20 years when I started using this protocol.

(13:06) But I have to say that this benefit may be lost but I have to say that this benefit may be lost due to administration of vaccines containing aluminum nanoparticles in pregnancy and in large amount, increasingly amounts of vaccines that we are giving to children. So, if you don&#39;t mind, we can go into this issue. Let&#39;s just pause for a moment. Is this gonna be the last set of slides on autism? Or did you have, because I really do, for the practitioners who are interested in going through the training for the Coimbra Protocol. I really wanted you to share a little bit more about what&#39;s involved with that. I know I sent some questions from our own scientist panel and some of the other doctors in our network, but I would like to just kind of turn the conversation from that for the general public to those who are in the medical field who might wanna come and learn more from you.

##### Training Coimbra Protocol Doctors in 5 days, no charge

(14:39) So, you are asking about training for other doctors, is that what you mean? Yeah, I sent some questions about the training and the protocol, such as what is the cost of participation and what is the curriculum? How many hours does it take? You know, if you could just kind of share a little bit about what is expected for those who want to be trained, because we don&#39;t have enough Coimbra Protocol practitioners in the United States. So if there- You have five of them. I trained five medical doctors. I think that four medical doctors and a lady, an osteopathic lady that works in the US. I&#39;m not sure how many of them are still working. I have received messages only from a few of them, but we never charged anything for medical doctors who came to Brazil to have a period of training. This usually takes a week, actually five days, from Monday to Friday.

(16:16) They see me treating patients, and they ask questions, and I respond to those questions as deeply as I can. But there is no charge. They have to only to deal with travel expenses, or hotel expenses, but nothing is charged by myself. I don&#39;t charge anything for that. I stopped training doctors during the pandemic, and I&#39;m now planning to resume those trainings, but I have to adjust my schedule to resume those trainings, because you see, you have a patient in the room, you have myself, you have one or two, or sometimes three doctors asking questions at the same time when I&#39;m seeing those patients and prescribing to those patients. But I try to do as much as I can. 

Is there any other question that you had about that? 

Well, do you have any idea when you&#39;re going to resume training, and how will we know, and then how would somebody get ahold of you to arrange to come and be a part of that? 

Maybe in the second half of this year. There are several issues now going on in my professional life, and related to that, I&#39;m receiving demands from doctors who had a period of training here, and every now and then they ask questions about the cases that they are seeing. But I&#39;m trying to do the best I can. Okay. So they could email you and arrange that, and then you&#39;ll be able to respond.

(18:46) Yeah, during those five years, there is a huge list of emails that have been sent asking for a period of training. But I&#39;m the only doctor in this clinic that is providing this clinic in English. And so it&#39;s a lot of work. You need to train more trainers. Train more trainers, yeah. But it has to be feasible too. 

One more curiosity before we move into autism. Did you see a lower incidence of COVID, severe COVID deaths among your patients who were on the high doses of vitamin D, the therapeutic doses? 

##### None of the Protocol patients receiving high dose of Vitamin D got COVID

In patients who were receiving high doses of vitamin D, none of them had COVID. In patients who were receiving what I consider the normal dose of vitamin D, which is 10,000 units, for someone who has a normal body mass index, they had only mild manifestations of COVID. There is thousands of publications now showing that low levels of vitamin D are related to severe cases of COVID and advising supplementation of COVID. When the COVID-19 started in 2020, I advised, I even recorded a clip that was published by one of my colleagues in the Facebook. In that video clip,  **I advised all patients to take 600,000 units of vitamin D immediately**  and started 10,000 units per day afterwards. 

##### Major setbacks when his patients got mRNA COVID vaccines

Some patients that were on high doses of vitamin D and had their autoimmune disorder under control, they had flares, MS patients had flares and new lesions when they took those mRNA vaccines. And that was kind of disappointing because, those were patients that were having a normal life for like 10 years and then they had those shots and then suddenly they have a new flare, a new lesion, active lesion. And we had to deal with this and that caused us a lot of problems.

(22:20) That was one of the issues that increased the amount of work and contributed to stop receiving other doctors for a period of training in our clinic. Did I answer your question or? Yes, yes, absolutely. If you don&#39;t mind, yes, absolutely. 

Okay, so I&#39;ve been in touch with Dr. Renu Mittani, who was also trained with you and I know she&#39;s training in India and I&#39;m not sure about training in other parts of the world, but would you encourage others to seek her and others who are possibly also training the other doctors in the Coimbra protocol to reach out to them? 

Yes, definitely. Dr. Renu Mittani is a very clever and efficient lady. She is doing a wonderful work training other doctors and I definitely need other doctors to train doctors so that I&#39;m the only one to be trained. I&#39;m the only one.

(24:16) I don&#39;t want to be the only one person training doctors in this so-called Coimbra protocol as it&#39;s now known by my patients. Definitely, I would encourage her to continue. She&#39;s been in touch with me because of that and I have already encouraged her to go on with that activity. So she&#39;s got your full support. That&#39;s good to know.

One concern that she brought up, and I&#39;m curious if this is also a concern for you in Brazil, is that some doctors, some practitioners who are doing the high dose, the therapeutic dose, vitamin D, there&#39;s some concern on their end for legal or lawsuits, legal actions taken for patients who do reach that toxicity. Has that ever been a concern for you? Have you had to deal with that in your practice? Or what is something that you could tell doctors who are, or do you already tell practitioners who are doing this to? Well, you understand that we are facing opposition from the medical community. And it&#39;s been like that since we started with this protocol. We started with this protocol. But I have to deal with this. This is something that I, it&#39;s part of my routine now. And I, what can I say? 

##### Riboflavin (B2) + Magnesium may treat most migraines, but are not used by doctors

For instance, if you go to the to Scholar Google, and you type migraine, and you type riboflavin, you will see that there are thousands of publications showing that high doses of riboflavin, like 400 milligrams per day, control migraine in 80% of cases. And if you increase, if you add magnesium to that treatment, you will reach close to 100% of cases under control. And you&#39;ll see that there is placebo control groups, studies using placebo control groups, randomized placebo control groups, everything that is suggested or indicated by the so-called evidence-based medicine.

(27:22) But there is not a single word about riboflavin in the textbook of the medical doctor that treats migraine. So, it&#39;s my opinion that the transmission of knowledge within the medical community is under strict control. And it seems to me that any kind of new therapy that is addressing the cause of diseases and carries the possibility of decreasing the commercialization, the trade of medicines, they seem to be excluded from textbooks and medical meetings.

##### It does not matter if you have 100,000 publications – (if there is no profit from it)

(28:33) So, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of publications, they are not mentioned. So, I don&#39;t have anything to do about that. I just have to keep my work, to do the best I can for my patients. And when there is some litigations, I have to try to deal with that in the best way I can. But I cannot be stressed because of that, because I know that stress triggers diseases. So, it really has to be part of the routine. Even Dr. Mittani has received criticisms from her peers. So, I think that this is expected. It&#39;s not something that you should be surprised to see about that. Maybe in some countries like the U.S., The pressure on medical doctors may be higher than in other countries, for obvious reasons. Most pharmaceutical companies are located there, but it&#39;s something, it&#39;s a problem that we have to face. Because I bet you&#39;ve probably seen the amount of effectiveness that comes from the use of therapeutic doses of vitamin D, how effective it is. And I&#39;m assuming, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that it&#39;s probably safer than a lot of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market for some of these diseases that you&#39;re treating with vitamin D. I&#39;m sure about that. The medicines that are sold to treat autoimmune disorders are very expensive, very, very expensive. There is one medication for MS that five tablets cost like $46,000 in US.

(31:23) So you can imagine what is happening, when you, what would happen when someone tries to provide another treatment that instead of causing depression of the immune system, enhances the power of the immune system in fighting infections. And there is something else that I have to add, some other information. Most of, when they say that in order to be accepted by the medical community, you have to perform a placebo-controlled, randomized placebo-controlled study, multicentric.

##### Not willing to have a control group of people not getting Vitamin D in an RCT

(32:25) We don&#39;t have money to make a multicentric study. I would never ask some relative of mine to take part of a study like that using, just to prove that vitamin D given in high doses controls those autoimmune disorders. Because I know that those patients who fall in the control group will be damaged and will be damaged forever. So I don&#39;t feel comfortable about that. I would never do that. And another issue is that this type of study is impossible.

##### RCT would be impossible anyway, as his protocol must adjust the dose, etc for each patient

(33:21) It would not be blinded, double-blinded, because you have to adjust the dose according to the resistance of the patient. So you have to see the laboratory results and adjust the dose according to those laboratory results. That&#39;s not possible in terms of placebo-controlled studies, double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Right. So that&#39;s it. We have to go on and do as much benefit to our patients as possible.

(34:07) Yeah. And in the meantime, you know, those who do take this into practice can rely on other doctors like you, Dr. Matani, and the many very knowledgeable vitamin D researchers, such as those on the grassroots health panel. We&#39;ve got a great community of individuals who are well aware of what&#39;s going on. Dr. William Grant, for example, wrote the Vitamin D Misinformation Playbook, and he talks about this a lot.

(34:42) And you just can&#39;t let that scare you. And just have faith that this really does work. Yes. Some other doctors that were trained in our clinic also have published about the safety of the Coimbra Protocol. And they have other doctors like those were, I guess it was from Germany, they produced two papers. And there is another paper published by Italian groups of medical doctors showing the improvement of quality of life.

(35:29) Those patients having under high doses of vitamin D. So I&#39;m glad to see that other doctors are planning to publish that because I cannot do everything on my own. 

##### Parkinson&#39;s is NOT an autoimmune disease, and they have very high levels of stress

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Note: [Parkinson&#39;s may be an Autoimmune Disease (data since 2017)](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-parkinson-s-an-autoimmune-d-mFE80OKPRrGk2bMzmerx3g)

That brings me to a question that one of our doctors sent me, and I hope you don&#39;t mind my asking you now, but Dr. Patrick Niccolo has published several papers. He is a medical doctor. He&#39;s been using high doses of vitamin D with all of his patients in the hospital that he works at, and he was wondering if you would be willing to collaborate with him on treating patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. That is one of the things that he would like to speak with you about, the therapeutic doses of vitamin D on Parkinson&#39;s and then publish it. 

I&#39;m glad that you asked that question. I&#39;m open to cooperate with any doctor, any physician, but I have to say that  **Parkinson&#39;s disease is not an autoimmune disorder** , and we don&#39;t use this high dose of vitamin D protocol in Parkinson&#39;s disease. Parkinson&#39;s disease is one of the most cases of diseases that we see  **very, very high level of stress in those patients** . They have ever been extremely worried about all problems that they face. They are highly responsible people. They don&#39;t want to accept that things are not under possible bad outcome. The outcomes of the problems that they are facing escape their control. They are trying to control everything.

(37:56) They are afraid of things that may happen. They think about every possible outcome of any problem they are facing. This is essentially the personality that is seen in almost 100% of patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. And we have been dealing with Parkinson&#39;s disease by trying to change that personality. Of course, we give vitamin D, not in high doses, what I call high dose. I&#39;m not sure what you are calling high doses in your question, but I&#39;m giving like 10,000 15,000 units of vitamin D to patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease because several years ago I tried to give them high doses of vitamin D and I felt it did not work. So we are trying other measures to decrease the activity of that disease, like giving glycine in  **high doses of glycine** , which is an amino acid that decreases, that causes calmness, induces calmness. We are associating that with any acetylcysteine (NAC).

(39:43) Also it seems to be working in the first few patients. I hope that impression goes on, but Parkinson&#39;s disease is not an autoimmune disorder. And I guess that this confusion came from the fact that doctors that were here to be trained on high doses of vitamin D, because I&#39;m a neurologist, I was also seeing patients with Parkinson&#39;s, lots of patients with Parkinson&#39;s. And maybe there&#39;s this impression that Parkinson&#39;s disease is responsive to high doses of vitamin D. That&#39;s not my impression, but we correct the level of vitamin D in those patients too, because of the effects of vitamin D has in the central nervous system in the brain, inducing neurotrophic factors that increase the lifespan of neurons. So that&#39;s what I have to say about that. No other information I have available. 

Thank you so much for discussing that topic.

##### Autism – started treating in 2014, Bradford Hill (dose response, happening everywhere – Vaccines?)

(41:11) Okay, I would love if you would continue on to the topic of autism. Are you ready? I started treating autism in 2014. And the reason why I started using, treating children with  **ASD**  was because there were publications showing benefits of vitamin D in autism, and also papers showing that TH17 is active in children with autism. So we started using high doses of vitamin D in autism, and we got very good results. But then afterwards, at some point,

(42:17) I faced with this undeniable relationship with autism, and the increasing number of vaccines that we&#39;re giving to children. As you see here, in 1970, you had one child with autism, or in 10,000, non-autistic children. So in 2018, you had like one in 36. Today in US, you have like one in 22. And in Brazil, it seems that we are having like one in 10 patients. This is a tragedy. And so we started investigating what could be causing this sharp increase, the rate of autism. And in order to do that, we had to use the method that was published in 1965 by a British epidemiologist. His name was Austin  **Bradford Hill** . And he said, he published a set of criteria that should be used to demonstrate that one factor is causing one disease. And thanks to that, he was able to prove that smoking was a cause of lung cancer. And since then, the criteria of causation of Bradford Hill is used in several other instances. So you could use to try to find out the cause of the explosion of autism. And according to those criteria, there&#39;s one criteria that is called the dose response criteria. So if, for instance, if smoking caused lung cancer, if I increase the number of cigarettes that I smoke per day, I will increase the risk of having lung cancer. This is dose response. I increase the dose, I will have an increased response.

(45:22) So if you want to find a factor that is causing autism, you have to find this factor that you are looking for has to follow the dose response criterion of Austin Bradford Hill. In other words, you have to find something that is increasing, some toxic agent to which children are more and more exposed. And the more you expose children to that factor, you increase the response, which is autism. It&#39;s like increasing the number of cigarettes

(46:11) in a certain population, smoking in a certain population, you would increase the response which would be the lung cancer. So looking for a factor like that, we have to realize that this factor should be applicable to all countries in the world because the explosion of autism is happening everywhere. It&#39;s not something that is happening in Brazil. It&#39;s not something that is happening only in the US or in Britain or Australia or any other country.

##### Autism is increasing around the world (along with vaccines)

(46:57)  **So it has to be some factor that is happening everywhere** , that is occurring everywhere. So what has occurred everywhere in all countries is the increase of number of vaccines given to children. So this timeline goes from 1967 to today. To 2012, and you see that by 1985, you had less than 70, less than 70% of children given like five vaccines or five shots of vaccines. In the second half of the 80s, it was the period when the sunscreen appeared and a lot of pressure, a lot of advertising so that people should avoid any kind of exposure any kind of solar exposure. And at the same time, they should be using sunscreen sometimes even if you are under artificial light. So the level of vitamin D dropped suddenly here in the whole population. And when between 1989 and 1990, 1991, there was an outbreak of measles that killed a lot of children, much unusual as compared to previous years when you had no limitations to expose yourself to sunlight. And as a consequence of that, you see that there were more and more and more vaccines. And as you increased the vaccines and the percentage of children covered with those vaccines when you were having more vaccines and more than 90% of children vaccinated. When this was happening, the number of cases of autism also increased. So the increasing of vaccines could be preliminarily accepted as a possible cause of autism, but

only that criterion does not prove that vaccines can cause autism. You may remember that it was like nine criteria. 

##### Criteria of mechanism: found Aluminum in brains of people who died with ASD

So you need another criteria, the  **criteria of mechanism** . So if vaccines cause autism, then there should be a mechanism by which vaccines are causing autism. So in order to find that, you have to look at the composition of vaccines, and all those vaccines that you see here and you give to children have aluminum nanoparticles in their composition. The vaccine given to prevent, to prevent the virus that causes cervical cancer, infection to that virus, also has aluminum salts. So then maybe you have a mechanism if you try to see if aluminum is toxic. So you look, you go to look, scholar Google, and you see that there are  **more than two million papers talking about or discussing about the toxicity of aluminum** . Aluminum is toxic even to plants, not only to animals or human beings.

(52:23) So then you may, then now you have a mechanism that strengthens the possibility that vaccines can be caused. Then you need a final, or what I consider to be a final proof that vaccines can really be accepted as a cause of autism. You have to find aluminum nanoparticles, because the type of aluminum that you inject in vaccines are nanoparticles of aluminum. It&#39;s not a soluble type of aluminum that you ingest when you drink water.

(53:17) When you drink water, you are ingesting soluble salt of aluminum and less than 1%, I mean like 0.25% of this aluminum salt that you ingest is absorbed, only 0.25%. And most of that aluminum that is absorbed is easily extracted, eliminated in the urine. That&#39;s not what happens when you inject aluminum nanoparticles. Aluminum nanoparticles are used in vaccines because they cause inflammation. And they have the antigens attached to those particles.

(54:20) So the immune cells phagocyte those particles, and that&#39;s the beginning of the process of producing antibodies. So if aluminum causes autism, and the aluminum of vaccines causes autism, then you have to find particles of aluminum in the brain tissue of children with autism or individuals with autism. And that was what these researchers from the United Kingdom have done. They published this in 2018 ([Aluminium in brain tissue in Autism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29413113/) [Cited 217 times](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13283697388213251461&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en)). They went to the University of Oxford because the University of Oxford has a bank of brains.

(55:29) Perhaps for the last 70 years, any patient who died in the hospitals that were affiliated to Oxford University and died with a neurological disease of unknown cause, they had their brains fixed with formalin, removed and stored in a bank of brains. So they went to that bank of brains, and they got samples of the brains of individuals that had died, not because of the diagnosis of autism, but with autism.

(56:27) And what they found is this, we can read individuals with a diagnosis of  **ASD**  have extraordinarily high levels of aluminum. This is the British way of aluminum in their brain tissue. So you see what they found in their brains, they found particles of aluminum. In immune cells, this is a lymphocyte, this is a macrophage that has several nanoparticles of, several particles of aluminum inside. So to me, as a medical doctor, since I was graduated, I was taught to give the highest level of importance to what pathologists find in the microscope. They usually have the final word, they say, okay, I was, I looked at the tissue and I found the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. So your patient has tuberculosis, and no one will ever discuss, argue, no one will ever argue against that statement, because it&#39;s like you saw the criminal in the scene of crime stabbing the victim, so to speak.

(58:23) So I have to give them the highest level of importance to this finding. So to me, it&#39;s quite clear that what is causing autism is the presence of aluminum in vaccines. And it&#39;s an absurd, because you could use other nanoparticles, like calcium phosphate nanoparticles, and reports about the effects of calcium phosphate nanoparticles is that they may cause even higher production of antibodies as compared to aluminum nanoparticles.

(59:21) So it&#39;s difficult to understand why, if this is being published everywhere, in several papers, in several scientific papers, and the pharma company that produces vaccines continue using aluminum nanoparticles in their vaccines, in their products. So as I told you, the fate of these nanoparticles, of these nanoparticles are completely different from that, that you see regarding soluble salts of aluminum that you ingest. They are biopersistent.

(1:00:10) Maybe we can remember that figure that I showed you demonstrating that I, um, a liquefied can cross the blood-brain barrier, carrying a virus, and thereby it would infect the, the nervous system. And this is called a  **Trojan horse mechanism** . So, if you imagine that this is not a viral particle, but actually, actually an aluminum nanoparticle, you understand why and how the aluminum nanoparticles bypass this barrier and reach the nervous system, the brain, and why it is found as particles within immune cells, like you see here. So, that&#39;s what I was telling you about aluminum causing inflammation, attracting immune cells to injection site. Aluminum nanoparticles contain antigens that absorb it. Their surfaces are phagocytized or engulfed by leukocyte, thereby triggering antibody synthesis. This is called adjuvant effect of nanoparticles. There is a chronic encephalitis associated with  **ASD** , and this can be demonstrated by measuring the level of this enzyme called neuro-specific enolase or NSE. Just like when the liver is inflamed, when there is an inflammatory process affecting the liver, the liver cells release their enzymes in the bloodstream. The same thing happens when you have an inflammatory process affecting the brain. Neurons release, the damaged neurons release this enzyme called neuro-specific enolase. Okay.

(1:02:52) The inflammation that is caused by the presence of  **aluminum nanoparticles breaks the blood-brain barrier so that now it&#39;s toxins and microbes can have access to the brain tissue** . The adjuvant effect of aluminum nanoparticles induces antibody synthesis against the brain tissue. This has been published. You see, neuro-specific enolase has been proposed as a biomarker of autism spectrum disorder. Many publications about that, more than 10,000 publications.

(1:03:48) Here you&#39;ll see 12,600 publications showing there&#39;s brain-specific autoantibodies in the plasma of subjects with autistic spectrum disorder. So this is also published. So if you try to combine everything that you know about the pathophysiology of  **ASD** , everything is explained by the toxic effect of aluminum. Even the wide range of metabolic disorders that you find in children with aluminum, in children with  **ASD** , I&#39;m sorry.

(1:04:59) Everything is explained on the basis of the toxic effects of aluminum nanoparticles. So  **ASD**  fulfills the criteria to be classified as an autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. This syndrome was first reported by Schoenfeld and Agmon-Levy in 2011. And they emphasized this, factors entailing an immune adjuvant activity, such as infections agents, silicone, aluminum salts, and others were associated with defined and non-defined immune mediated diseases.

(1:06:05) So adjuvants can cause autoimmune diseases, can trigger autoimmune diseases. And that&#39;s exactly what is happening in the brains of children with  **ASD** . They have inflamed brain. Aluminum nanoparticles is within immune cells in their brain. They are infiltrating their brain. And it&#39;s definitely ASIA syndrome. So it&#39;s important to emphasize the question, the issue about infections. Infections agents can induce an autoimmune disorder, not immune disease.

(1:07:04) And this is exactly what happens regarding the MMR vaccine, because I&#39;ll talk to you, talk about that in a moment. This slide shows that interleukin-17 is elevated in the serum of children with autism, just like in any other disease, any other autoimmune disease. So autism and vitamin D releases more than 27,000 publications because vitamin D suppresses TH17 cytokine production. So looking at that picture produced by Rome City, showing that pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines cannot be sued due to a law that was approved in US in 1986. And the number of vaccines containing aluminum that is given simultaneously in a two-month-old baby, I cannot accept that as something that should be considered normal. So this slide shows that regarding the hepatitis B vaccine, the amount of aluminum that is given to a child in the first day of life is equivalent to the amount of aluminum present in 10 shots of the same vaccine given to a 70-kilogram adult person.

(1:09:45) And if you go, if you now go to a baby that is only two-month-old and the baby receives this amount of aluminum per kilogram of body weight, and  **this is equivalent to 24 vaccines given in a single day to a 70 kilogram adult** . This is not acceptable. Here you see the year of 1986, when this National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was approved in US. You see the number of shots that children were having or receiving in 1983.

(1:10:43) And in the number they were receiving in 2023, 76 shots. And now you see that in 2024, it was like 88 doses. So moreover, it&#39;s important to say that during pregnancy, during pregnancy, the flu vaccine, the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine, and the RSV vaccine containing aluminum nanoparticles is given to pregnant women and may cross the placental barrier and accumulate in the fetal brain. This has been demonstrated in experimental animals, and probably they cross the placental barrier using the same mechanism of Trojan horse mechanism that you&#39;re seeing in the brain tissue. So that&#39;s it. If you have any other question, you can just ask me. The reason that I am trying to provide information about the role that aluminum nanoparticles are playing in the pathophysiology of ASD is quite clear to me, and we are facing an emergency. We could be using calcium phosphate nanoparticles that is even more effective as compared to aluminum nanoparticles in producing higher titers of antibodies. And I don&#39;t see any reason why you should not change the aluminum to calcium phosphate. In addition to that, it&#39;s quite clear to me that if you keep the level of vitamin D, circulating vitamin D that we had in the beginning, up to the beginning of the 80s, children had up to the beginning of the 80s, most of those vaccines would be not necessary.

(1:13:43) We&#39;d decrease the number of vaccines that are required to be given to young children. I&#39;m open to your question. I have two. And my first question, you mentioned the amount of aluminum particles in sunscreen, and I know that women are concerned about aluminum in their deodorant. Now, that is not the nanoparticle form of aluminum, correct? So you&#39;re not necessarily worried about it getting into the brain as much as the lymph and causing issues outside, or am I incorrect? This was one of the slides that maybe I missed to mention. I&#39;m mismentioning that. But yes, the kind of aluminum that you apply to the people, apply to their skin to protect them from sunlight is nanoparticles of aluminum. And it&#39;s absorbed by the intact skin. Undamaged skin absorbs that aluminum. The amount of aluminum that is absorbed depends on how frequently you apply to your skin. There are people that apply sunscreen like three times per day, even when they are working in an office, believe you or not, they are not exposed to sunlight, they apply sunscreen to their skin. And the surface of your skin that you apply also plays a role, of course, regarding the amount of aluminum that you absorb in your skin. But yes, that&#39;s what I can say. The amount is variable depending on several variables, like those that I mentioned, the surface that you apply, the sunscreen, how often you apply, and the concentration, probably the concentration of aluminum is related to degree of sun protection that you have. Because the aluminum is used to reflect the sunlight and prevent them to enter the skin. And that&#39;s the reason why they reduced, almost abolished the production of vitamin D. Right. Okay, so it&#39;s not like the aluminum that we ingest. It actually is not excreted like the aluminum we ingest.

(1:17:00) It&#39;s absorbed and could possibly harm the brain and cause issues, not even related to  **ASD** , but other neurological issues. If this could cause other neurological issues, not only. Yes, they can cause any autoimmune disorder. It can cause learning difficulties. And it&#39;s good that you asked about that because the elementary schools are falling apart all over the world at the same time when the autism is raising because children in Australia, Spain, United Kingdom, probably in U.S., yes, in U.S. too, they are not being able to learn almost anything. I received a teacher of the elementary school and I asked her what percentage of her students she could pass information they could learn. And she said that it would be only 15%. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that this is a disaster because those children will be the adults of tomorrow and they will have to support society. And they will have to support those who have major disabilities like the severe cases of autism. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that we are facing a global emergency. We have to stop that. Otherwise, human society will not be feasible, would not be possible to exist as in the way that we know today. I cannot be more in fact, I cannot emphasize this subject more than I have than in our interviews, in our interview.

(1:19:47) So I expect you to pass the message. 

Yes, one last question. Besides strengthening the immune system and making these vaccines less needed. Is there any other role of vitamin D in reducing the effects of the aluminum or other toxins that might decrease the risk of these resulting diseases, whether it&#39;s  **ASD**  or autoimmune diseases that are caused or likely caused by the toxins? 

Yes, vitamin D definitely reduced the risk but does not prevent these to occur. Even in patients, pregnant women who were taking high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy, they may have children with  **ASD**  due to the vaccines that the children received afterwards. Another issue that came to my mind is to say that when a pregnant woman is taking those high doses of vitamin D that we are taking, the baby is born with high levels of vitamin D, very, very high levels of vitamin D.

(1:21:29) And the calcium levels is at the upper limit of the normal range. But they don&#39;t have any problems related to that. Afterwards, vitamin D is decreasing. And the level of calcium remains within the normal range. And the mother also provides vitamin D by breastfeeding. So if she is taking high doses of vitamin D, the baby will also receive high doses of vitamin D by when they are breastfed. But this has not caused any problem to our children.

(1:22:31) See, have I answered all questions? 

##### Silica removes aluminum from the body – reduces depression, ADHD, MS etc.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; see also &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/aluminum-appears-to-increase-ms-alzheimers-etc-silica-water-removes-it&quot; style=&quot;color: red; text-decoration: underline;&quot; title=&quot;This post/category does not exist yet: Aluminum appears to increase MS, Alzheimer&#39;s, etc. - silica water removes it&quot;&gt;Aluminum appears to increase MS, Alzheimer&#39;s, etc. - silica water removes it&lt;/a&gt;

There is something else. Well, a final one, just similar topic, because there are some cases of autism that have potentially been treated with high dose vitamin D. Is that something that you&#39;ve also treated? And is it addressing the aluminum toxicity in the brain? And this might be a whole other topic, but just a brief answer,  **if you are aware of vitamin D reversing the effects of the aluminum toxicity** .

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;See VitaminDWiki: [Silica reduces Aluminum in the body - perhaps reducing MS, ADHD, Alzheimer&#39;s etc.](/posts/silica-reduces-aluminum-in-the-body-perhaps-reducing-ms-adhd-alzheimers-etc)

(1:23:12) High doses of vitamin D in children with autism, it&#39;s also an autoimmune disorder. You see, you saw that there are high levels of auto antibodies against the brain. So we give high doses of vitamin D. That was the beginning of the treatment when we started treating those children in 2014. But now we also  **try to eliminate aluminum nanoparticles by giving silica** . And we can see that the level of concentration of aluminum increases in the urine and in the blood at the beginning of the treatment. Important to say that the concentration of aluminum that you have in the blood is 300 times less than the concentration that you have in the tissues, like in the brain. So the level of aluminum that you measure in the blood does not reflect what you have in the brain. And that&#39;s why when you start giving silica to those patients, you see that the first phase when aluminum in the blood increases and the level of aluminum in the urine also increases. Then there is a second phase when the level of aluminum is decreasing in the blood. Is it still increased in the urine? And the final phase, when you have undetectable levels of aluminum in the blood and in the urine. So this is a major point for us to address.  **We have to eliminate aluminum** . There is something else that just came to my mind and I think you would be interested to know about. When we started treating patients with  **ASD** , at the same time, we were also treating young people with autoimmune disorders, like MS, for instance, like rheumatoid arthritis. And then we added to the protocol because they were born after 1990.  **We added silica to the protocol.** So this is a major addition to our protocol. We are trying to detoxify aluminum in all our patients.

(1:26:59) And we are amazed to see how much aluminum they are eliminating in the urine when you start giving silica. And this is something that will decrease the process of inflammation in all autoimmune disorders. So this is a major addition to the treatment. Last year, in the last two years, I would say, 2023, 2023, 2024, I was amazed to see because I always ask about all diseases that occur in the family of patients.

(1:27:55) And I was amazed to see the number of young people and adolescents with severe depression, severe depression. Nowadays, children, I would say, a five-year-old, if you have a classroom with like 20 five-year-old children, most of them are taking antidepressive drugs at five years of age. This is unbelievable. This is really unbelievable. I had a case of a young lady that came with her mother. Her mother was an MS patient.

(1:29:02) And this patient, at some point, her mobility started getting worse and worse with more and more difficulties related to her walking ability. And at some point in May, 2023, she had an appointment and she was requiring the support of a cane on the right side and the support of the arm of someone to be able to walk. So she was getting worse and worse during the previous two years. And I told her that all MS patients that I have that are getting worse, in spite of having high levels of vitamin D patients with MS. All those patients that are getting worse, even taking high doses of vitamin D are adjusted according to the laboratory tests, pH level. All of those that are getting worse were having a high level, a very high level of stress. So I asked her, what&#39;s your level of stress? Because you are getting worse and worse during the last two years. And she said, in a scale from zero to 10,  **her level of stress was 10** . So I asked her, what was the reason for that? And she said, it was because of her daughter. And I asked her, what was happening with her daughter? And she said that her daughter was taking antidepressant drugs since she was four years old. And at some point in her adolescence, she started cutting herself, self-mutilation.

(1:31:37) And she had attempted suicide twice. So that patient told me that when her daughter was leaving to go to school, she would not be able to say for sure if she was coming back or not. So that was the reason of her high level of stress. So I asked the girl, the young lady to come in and ask her to try to stop that behavior because her mother was getting worse. And she said that she would do everything that she could because she loved her mother very much. But I gave her silica because when she started having when she started with depression, she was taking a large number of vaccines. Well, she came back one year later and I could not recognize that young lady. She was completely different. She was well-dressed. Her hair were completely, were well combed. I can&#39;t say that, describe that. I did not recognize her. She was happy.

(1:33:34) She was smiling. And I asked her if she was, how was her depression? And she said that she was 85% better. And her psychiatrist was decreasing the doses of medications that were, that he was, had prescribed. She was taking four medications to keep her alive. And the psychiatrist was decreasing the doses of psychiatric drugs. So I asked her why, what was the reason why she was cutting herself? And she said something that we&#39;ll never forget.

(1:34:34) She said that she had to cause pain to herself to stop paying attention to the pain, psychological pain of having depression. Psychological pain of having to live. That was the reason why she was causing pain to herself. But she was not doing that anymore. And she had plans for the future. So that was the first case. But then there were two more other cases and the same result. So we are now seeing an epidemic of self-mutilations among adolescents and young adults. This is happening everywhere. We have seen an epidemic of suicide in several countries. So imagine what this is, the problem, I was, there is a principle, a principle that was proposed more than 1,000 years ago. And it&#39;s considered to be the first principle of statistics and says when several things are happening in the same place with the same persons, probably they have one cause, one single cause. This is called the  **principle of parsimony** . And it&#39;s used in several, if not all sciences, including in the daily medical practice. To explain all symptoms signs and the laboratory abnormalities that you see in a patient and explain with one single diagnosis. It&#39;s called the principle of parsimony. And if we apply the principle of parsimony to all things that we are seeing in our society, in several countries at the same time, autism,  **ASD** , depression, we can find, we have to find one single explanation. And that&#39;s to me, that is the presence of aluminum nanoparticles in the brain causing inflammation and causing all these diseases. I have seen increased anomalies levels in children with  **ASD** , with children with, in children with not only  **ASD** , but also attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.

(1:38:07) They also have high levels of inlays, and this is not published, but I have seen in their laboratory results. So I hope that this information is helpful to you because it&#39;s an amazing, it&#39;s a devastating pain when the parents lose a child because of suicide. Yeah. And they are jumping from the apartments in big cities. They are hanging themselves in small cities. And this is happening in Brazil, and I think it&#39;s happening everywhere too.

(1:38:50) I have seen that it&#39;s happening in other countries. So you imagine the pain that is, this procedure is using aluminum nanoparticles in vaccines are causing. Okay. Very important message to get out. What? It&#39;s a very important message to get out. Thank you. Something needs to change. Yeah. Because it&#39;s difficult to deal with those mothers that have a child for those reasons. It&#39;s difficult to deal with the mother that brings her 16 year old adolescent child and says, doctor, he depends on me to use the toilet. What will happen to my child when I die? going to take, who is going to take care as I take care now of this child. It&#39;s a lot of suffering. And so that&#39;s why I decided that I had to tell you this. It&#39;s important that this is invest properly investigated. Yeah, my, my boys are 17 and 16 and they&#39;re still in high school.

(1:40:22) My, my two boys are 16 and 17 in high school. And it&#39;s a big problem, the depression and the, the suicide. It&#39;s a major problem everywhere. So I think a lot of people will be thankful to hear this information and I hope that, that there can be some serious action taken from it.

That was when I started prescribing 10,000 units of vitamin D daily for patients with autoimmune disorders, not only MS, but mainly for MS patients because, as you know, I&#39;m a neurologist. And I was amazed the results were impressive just by giving them 10,000 units of vitamin D. At that time, I found a paper published in 1986 by Goldberg and co-workers from Boston reporting a reduced frequency of relapses in MS patients taking about 5,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil. And they demonstrated it was just a simple research. They compared the frequency of relapses before giving them about 5,000 units of vitamin D and during the period when they were receiving that amount of vitamin D.\n\n(06:08) And they found a reduced frequency of relapses. So that was the beginning of everything. Well, thank goodness you found that research. And I said, it&#39;s a good thing you found that research. I was looking for it. \n\nSo are you going to explain in a little more detail about why vitamin D is important in the treatment of autoimmune disease? Did you want to get to that first or do you want to kind of just discuss a little bit more about how that evolved into what is now known as the Coimbra protocol?\n\n(07:02) I would like to start explaining general issues about the importance of vitamin D for our organism. Okay, let&#39;s do the presentation now. Go ahead if you would like. Can you see the presentation? Yes. Okay. So this first presentation shows that vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB light, sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow.  So vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow that is not larger than our stage. If you are living in big cities, working in a confined environment and are not properly supplemented with vitamin D, then you are definitely vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is actually a precursor of steroid hormone and can be turned into its correspondent active hormone in several of our cells, not only in kidney cells as most people believe. Okay. Dark-skinned individuals required about five to 10 times longer exposure to sunlight to produce vitamin D compared to fair-skinned individuals. So dark-skinned individuals living in high latitudes are likely to develop severe vitamin D deficiency and they are more susceptible to a wide range of apparently unrelated diseases like tuberculosis and hypertension. So at least in Brazil, the sunscreen was launched in 1960, in 1984. So, from that moment on, there were a lot of propaganda trying to make people to avoid any kind of, any minimal exposure to sunlight. And this had two consequences. For instance, if you use a protection factor of 8, that blocks approximately 95% of production of vitamin D.\n\n(10:39) And if you use a factor of 15, then approximately 99% of the continuous production of vitamin D will be blocked. So in addition to that, the second consequence is that sunscreens can contain aluminum hydroxide coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles. And those nanoparticles can penetrate the intact skin. And aluminum is extremely toxic metal. That vitamin D is not actually a vitamin, it&#39;s a steroid hormone. It converts into a hormone in several of human cells and it&#39;s needed by nearly all cells for their functions. Low vitamin D levels play a role in the development of many diseases. So this is the number of just a few examples of diseases that are affected by the level of vitamin D that a person has. And you see it for general human health, you have almost 2 million papers already published. This led us to this publications by Stumpf in 2012, he said that vitamin D is as fundamental as the sun and the closest we have to a panacea.\n(12:39) Regarding the immune system, we have more than half a million publications available in Google Scholar. And here is just a slide to demonstrate how important vitamin D is for the immune cells. Suppose that you have immune cells that has phagocyted mycobacterium tuberculosis. So it&#39;s within the cell and the cell has to destroy it. In order to do that, mycobacterium tuberculosis, as any other bacteria, is stimulated as toll-like receptors. And as a consequence of that, messages are sent, chemical messages are sent to the nuclei of immune cells. And this makes immune cells to express the 1-alpha hydroxylase, which turns the 25-hydroxy D to 25-hydroxy D, which is the active form of vitamin D. And this active form of vitamin D stimulates the vitamin D receptor. As a consequence of that, catechins are produced, and these are compounds that destroyed virtually any kind of microorganism that has invaded our body. So we see how important vitamin D is for the immune system. If we don&#39;t have vitamin D, then the bacteria like mycobacterium tuberculosis will remain alive within the immune cells. So if we look for vitamin D and infectious disease, this slide shows that by 2021, there were almost 300,000 peer-reviewed publications on the functions of vitamin D in the immune system. And today, in 2025, we have almost 400 papers published. Infectious disease, you see this large number of publications showing how vitamin D level is important to control all of those infectious diseases. I would like to show you an example of that by presenting Dr. Auguste Rollier. He died in 1954. He was a Swiss physician who treated tuberculosis in the first half of the 1900s, at a time when no effective antibiotics were available to combat that highly contagious chronic disease.\n`
│   inner_content: `. That was when I started prescribing 10,000 units of vitamin D daily for patients with autoimmune disorders, not only MS, but mainly for MS patients because, as you know, I&#39;m a neurologist. And I was amazed the results were impressive just by giving them 10,000 units of vitamin D. At that time, I found a paper published in 1986 by Goldberg and co-workers from Boston reporting a reduced frequency of relapses in MS patients taking about 5,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil. And they demonstrated it was just a simple research. They compared the frequency of relapses before giving them about 5,000 units of vitamin D and during the period when they were receiving that amount of vitamin D.\n\n(06:08) And they found a reduced frequency of relapses. So that was the beginning of everything. Well, thank goodness you found that research. And I said, it&#39;s a good thing you found that research. I was looking for it. \n\nSo are you going to explain in a little more detail about why vitamin D is important in the treatment of autoimmune disease? Did you want to get to that first or do you want to kind of just discuss a little bit more about how that evolved into what is now known as the Coimbra protocol?\n\n(07:02) I would like to start explaining general issues about the importance of vitamin D for our organism. Okay, let&#39;s do the presentation now. Go ahead if you would like. Can you see the presentation? Yes. Okay. So this first presentation shows that vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB light, sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow.  So vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow that is not larger than our stage. If you are living in big cities, working in a confined environment and are not properly supplemented with vitamin D, then you are definitely vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is actually a precursor of steroid hormone and can be turned into its correspondent active hormone in several of our cells, not only in kidney cells as most people believe. Okay. Dark-skinned individuals required about five to 10 times longer exposure to sunlight to produce vitamin D compared to fair-skinned individuals. So dark-skinned individuals living in high latitudes are likely to develop severe vitamin D deficiency and they are more susceptible to a wide range of apparently unrelated diseases like tuberculosis and hypertension. So at least in Brazil, the sunscreen was launched in 1960, in 1984. So, from that moment on, there were a lot of propaganda trying to make people to avoid any kind of, any minimal exposure to sunlight. And this had two consequences. For instance, if you use a protection factor of 8, that blocks approximately 95% of production of vitamin D.\n\n(10:39) And if you use a factor of 15, then approximately 99% of the continuous production of vitamin D will be blocked. So in addition to that, the second consequence is that sunscreens can contain aluminum hydroxide coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles. And those nanoparticles can penetrate the intact skin. And aluminum is extremely toxic metal. That vitamin D is not actually a vitamin, it&#39;s a steroid hormone. It converts into a hormone in several of human cells and it&#39;s needed by nearly all cells for their functions. Low vitamin D levels play a role in the development of many diseases. So this is the number of just a few examples of diseases that are affected by the level of vitamin D that a person has. And you see it for general human health, you have almost 2 million papers already published.

And he used to treat tuberculosis by exposing his patients to sunlight. And the reason why he had to be 2,000 meters above the sea level is because he wanted to be above the clouds so that he would have sunlight throughout the year. So the treatment consisted of daily escalating solar exposure.\n\n(17:48) His buildings were called sanatoriums. One sanatorium situated in Davos appears in the novel The Magic Mountains by Thomas Mann, who was first published in German in November 1924. This is an example of his results. On the left side of the slide, we observe a four-year-old patient with 34 foci of osteoarthritis, adenitis, like you will see here, numerous ulcers, as this one. I would like you to pay attention to this one, and tuberculomas affecting his right forearm.\n(18:50) The patient also presents with advanced tuberculosis affecting both feet, the right hand, the left lung, and the abdomen. We call it peritonitis. He was extremely thin, had a lot of, he had lost a lot of body weight, and at a level that we call cachexia. His lower left shoulder suggests that he had also had rickets, and it&#39;s important to say that rickets, children with rickets frequently died because of tuberculosis, and at some point, some medical doctors thought that tuberculosis and rickets had the same origin. On the right side of the slide, we see the same patient one year later, healing of ulcers, deconstruction of bones, muscles, and the general condition. And you see that ulcer is now healed. At a time when the importance of vitamin D for our immune system was not known, Dr. Joliot credited the success of his treatment to exposure to sunlight and to the pure air of the mountains.\n\n(20:47) The effectiveness of solar exposure in treating tuberculosis is evidenced by the establishment of sanatoriums in various locations worldwide, including the mountain regions of southern Brazil. However, at some point, the sanatoriums were fitted with glass windows and glass blocks the UVB rays, which are required for vitamin D synthesis in the skin. As a result, the sanatoriums ceased treating tuberculosis and were closed at a time when the first antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment, the injectable streptomycin was introduced to the market. Now sanatoriums turned into hotels in the Swiss mountains. So low vitamin D goes to low catalytic synthesis, allowing microbes to remain alive within the immune cells. And that leads us to the Trojan horse mechanism. We see here the structure of the blood-brain barrier,\n(22:16) including the astrocytic podocyte, participating in this barrier. And we see that some virus like HIV virus, when you have low levels of vitamin D, they are not destroyed by the immune cells. And when the immune cells penetrate the blood-brain barrier, because they have the mechanism, those cells have the mechanism required for this penetration, it&#39;s carrying virus. So that&#39;s the way when the brain becomes infected by HIV and several other virus probably, like in some types of severe measles and like in polio, you also have the same mechanism. This is called the Trojan horse mechanism because the virus enters the brain within the immune cells. And by doing that, they bypass the blood-brain barrier. In September, 2018, the WHO called for urgent action to end the tuberculosis epidemic. Prior to the COVID epidemic, tuberculosis was the deadliest infectious diseases.\n(24:07) It was killing like 2000 people per day worldwide. The combined use of multiple antibiotics to combine the antibiotic resistance has shown limited effectiveness nowadays. So autoimmune, this is an important issue to our protocol. Autoimmune diseases are almost always triggered by stressful life events. And managing emotional stress should be regarded as essential for the success of all therapeutic approaches, not only related to autoimmune diseases, but also to several other diseases. So then we are merged into this vicious cycle when emotional distress leads to reduced magnesium. And as magnesium is required for vitamin D activation, then you have reduced vitamin D activity. And that increases the possibility of acquiring an autoimmune disorder. And when the patient has a chronic disease, has acquired an autoimmune disorder, then this contributes to deepen the emotional distress. So reduced magnesium also causes excessive reaction to daily life problems and increases emotional distress. So this emotional distress disrupts the epigenetic control of dirty genes that we call the SNPs that we all have. We all have dirty genes, but they are usually switched off since prenatal life. And when we have a high level of stress, this in a way switch on those genes. So if you look for autoimmune disorders and stressful life events, we know we today have like more, almost 12,000 papers published. This is an example. Association between stressful life events and autoimmune disorders. Now going to vitamin D and autoimmune diseases, the issue of vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. We have more than 200,000 papers published. And so all those autoimmune diseases have tens of thousands of papers published relating them to low levels of vitamin D. So all the vitamin D works in autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disease is mediated by abnormal immune response, which is called TH17. There are almost 300,000 papers showing that this is the mechanism involved in the origin of autoimmune diseases. And vitamin D inhibits TH17. We have more than 3,000 papers, 3,000 papers showing the property of vitamin D related to inhibition of TH17. You see, it suppresses the TH17 cytokine production. This slide is to review the metabolism of vitamin D within immune cells. Vitamin D, cholecal sepharol is hydroxylated in the liver and released in the circulation. So vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-D enters the cell, undergoes a second hydroxylation within immune cells and the resulting 125-hydroxy-D stimulates a VDR, vitamin D receptor that inhibits TH17 programs and stimulates the proliferation of TH17. regulatory T cells. Okay, this is the same slide. So vitamin D and TH17, as I told you, we have like more than 30,000 publications. And how we adjust the dose of vitamin D. Here we have the parathyroid cells, a cell of one of the four parathyroid glands that we have close to our thyroid gland. And the vitamin D that is activated in the liver also enters the parathyroid cells. It&#39;s activated and simulate as VDR and the simulation of VDR by the active form of vitamin D inhibits the production of PTH, parathyroid hormone. So what we do in order to match the level of resistance that a person has to vitamin D is to measure PTH before the treatment and after five months of treatment. So when we increase PTH, when we increase vitamin D, PTH decreases and the goal is to decrease PTH to just above the lower level of the reference range for PTH. So PTH inhibition has two advantages as concerned to our protocol using high doses of vitamin D. It shows the level of individual resistance to vitamin D. And if PTH is not decreased below the lower level of the reference range, then this assures safety. It means that we are pretty sure that there will be no intoxication. Intoxication meaning increased level of calcium.\n`

│   full_match: `\n(32:45) Before we go on, are you going to talk a little bit more about what vitamin D resistance is? \nPatients who have autoimmune disorders, they have polymorphic changes affecting any combination of the nine genes that is required for vitamin D effects.\n(33:35) So we don&#39;t know the level of resistance that a specific patient may have. So we have to test it. So we give a testing dose that could be something like 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And so vitamin D starts increasing and it takes like three, four or five months to level off. So we measure PTH before starting vitamin D, the supplements with high doses of vitamin D and after five months. So at the end of this five months, we see how much vitamin D, when we increased vitamin D, how much PTH decreased. That was what I was trying to show you when I showed this. Suppose that this is the level of PTH that you have before the treatment, before taking 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And this is the level of PTH that you have five months later. So it should be just above the lower level of the reference range. If it has decreased below that level, so I have to decrease the daily dose of vitamin D. If it is far above the lower level of the reference range, so I still have to give more vitamin D as compared to what I was giving during this period of test, okay? So the first six months is like a testing period. We give a testing dose and we see how much the level of, I mean, how much the level of PTH will decrease. So at the end of these five months periods, when we receive the patients in a second appointment, then I look at the level of PTH and I have to calculate how much PTH, how much vitamin D, how much vitamin D I have to give in addition to that previous dose or how much vitamin D I have to decrease as compared to that previous dose. I don&#39;t know if I explained myself properly. Well, if you wouldn&#39;t mind going back to one of the slides that shows the immune cell.\n(36:52) One of my favorite presentations of yours was a presentation you did in Germany and you showed these slides that explained visually what happens like regarding the vitamin D resistance and why that leads to a decreased activity of vitamin D or a decreased response to vitamin D so that the more vitamin D resistance there is in an individual, the less vitamin D activity there is and the more vitamin D they&#39;ll need to overcome that vitamin D resistance. \n(38:11) So this is one of my first patients that I treated. She had SLE, and that was the result of only 10,000 units\n(39:02) of vitamin D per day after six months of treatment. So you imagine how impressed I was because that was the only change. The only change that I did in her treatment was to add vitamin D, 10,000 units per day. So you see her right face here, the difference between before and after the treatment, the left face. So here you see another patient with psoriasis. You see the psoriasis lesions affecting this area of her face.\n(39:55) And after six months taking 10,000 units of vitamin D, of vitamin D, you see this benefit that she had. You see the difference giving her 10,000 units of vitamin D within, after six months, you see how improved the lesions were. So this is the same patient. So here you have patients with multiple sclerosis. And she was born in 1982. And this is when she had the first flare of multiple sclerosis. So this MRI was taken in March 14.\n(40:56) And you see those lesions, those were recent lesions because it was her first flare. Okay, it&#39;s important to say that because vitamin D has also effects on the cells that produce myelin, which is called oligodendrocytes. So it promotes remyelination in multiple sclerosis. But that remyelination only occurs when you have recent lesions. When you have lesions that are older than one year, back when you start the treatment.\n(41:43) So it&#39;s more difficult to have remyelination of lesions. But that provides a comparison between March 2011 and July, 2012. More than one year had elapsed between one MRI and another. This lesions, those lesions were active in the first set of MRIs. I&#39;m not showing you this here, but they were making up a contrast. So you see here another patient who had a lesion, MS lesion affecting a critical area of the brain.\n(42:49) This lesion can cause severe symptoms and disability. It was a patient born in 1989. The first slide was taken, the first slide is on the MRI made in April 18, 2011. And the second slide was done about two years later, more than two years later. And you see the disappearance of that lesion. It was also a recent lesion. There were kind of lesions, old lesions here who had lesions, not so old lesions, but you see that maybe the spinal cord is a little bit swollen because of some lesions were present here, but they also had disappeared two and a half years later. So this is a severe type of multiple sclerosis. It&#39;s called Malon concentric sclerosis. It&#39;s a severe disease related to multiple sclerosis. Usually patients do not survive for more than two or three years after the diagnosis. And you see the first MRI that was taken in October, 2008.\n(44:30) And there were several MRIs in between, but like five years later, you only have the scar of those lesions and no additional lesion. So that was impressive to me. I was impressed with that case because as a neurologist, I know how Malon concentric sclerosis is a severe disease. So this slide is to show why we should not use the active form of vitamin D to treat those patients. So colicalciferol, which is the form of vitamin D that we give to patients orally, goes to the liver, undergoes the first hydroxylation, turning it into 25-hydroxy-D. This increase in 25-hydroxy-D has no effect, does not inhibit the 25-hydroxylase located in the liver. So the 25-hydroxy-D goes to kidney and to immune cells like mycophages, and you&#39;ll find one alpha hydroxylase in both sites in both cells. So they turned one alpha hydroxylase into a drug they turn in the 25-hydroxy-D into the active form of vitamin D. The kidney releases into the circulation, the blood serum, but the immune cells like mycophages use this active form of vitamin D to supply its needs. So it&#39;s not supposed to release in the circulation. So when one 25-hydroxy-D is released in the circulation, it inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. And this is an important step to prevent intoxication because the one 25-hydroxy-D is capable of increasing calcium levels to a very high level. So we should avoid having that. And when we give a cholecalciferol, you see that when the kidneys release the one 25-hydroxy-D, the one 25-hydroxy-D released in the circulation inhibits the renal enzyme. So one 25-hydroxy-D go to the intestines and bones and it releases calcium in the circulation and the release of calcium in the circulation further inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. But this has no, calcium level has no effect in the one alpha hydroxylase located in the immune cells. So that&#39;s the reason why we should use a cholecalciferol and not never use a one 25-hydroxy-D because if you use one 25-hydroxy-D, you will bypass all this controlling homeostatic mechanisms that this does not happen when you use cholecalciferol. So this is something important. It shows how one alpha hydroxylase works both in the kidneys and in immune cells and in several other tissues like the brain, placenta and several other tissues. So the reduced form of one alpha hydroxylase is capable of synthesizing one 25-hydroxy-D but it requires magnesium as a cofactor. But when it turns 25-hydroxy-D, D into 125-hydroxy-D, it gets oxidized. So in the oxidized form, one alpha hydroxylase cannot pick up another molecule of 25-hydroxy-D to turn it into the active form of vitamin D.\n(50:24) So it has to go back to the reduced form. This enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, comprising like more than 100 enzymes. And this family of enzymes have an auxiliary enzyme that is called reductase of the cytochrome P450. And this enzyme requires both the active forms of vitamin B2 as a prosthetic group. And it&#39;s capable of reducing the oxidized one alpha hydroxylase. When this occurs, the reductase is oxidized, but it is capable of reducing itself back to the reduced form of cytochrome P450 reductase. So this cycle has to go on, but in order for this cycle to go on, you need this cycle to go on. So in order to keep hydroxylating vitamin D to the active form, you need magnesium and vitamin B2. And it&#39;s important to know that like 10 to 15% of the world population has reduced the ability to absorb riboflavin. Several of those people have autoimmune disorders.\n(52:37) This was demonstrated by this article published in 1994. So this is extremely important to me because it&#39;s like 10% of the world population. It&#39;s important to say that high doses of colic alcephalol should be taken under the supervision of an experienced physician to avoid harm and renal function. \n\nReal quickly, Dr. Coimbra, can you just define what high doses?  Because some people consider high dose the 10,000 IU a day.\n(53:20) Is that the dose that you&#39;re talking about? Or are you talking about the doses that you use in your protocol, the 1,000 IU per kilogram, correct? Yes. Okay, 10,000 units per day is an amount of vitamin D that you can produce by solar exposure. So nobody has ever got intoxicated with vitamin D by exposing the skin to sunlight. So if you are lying down on horizontal position, you have a fair skin and the sun is high enough, your skin is a young skin, then you can produce this amount of vitamin D within like 20 minutes or 30 minutes. So it&#39;s hard to believe that people still believe that 10,000 units of vitamin D is a high dose of vitamin D considering that this is easily produced by exposing the skin to sunlight. So when I&#39;m talking about high doses of vitamin D, I&#39;m talking about the doses that we give to patients initially, which is 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. So this is a high dose. And maybe it could be called a therapeutic dose because it&#39;s what you&#39;re using to help treat these patients and not necessarily what somebody in the general population might take just to maintain their vitamin D levels. Never, the general population should not take this high dose of vitamin D. Only patients who have autoimmune disorders and under medical supervision.\n(55:41) I&#39;m glad we clarified that because the therapeutic use is a use that should be used with a medical device provider who is observing and watching for toxicity and measuring the PTH and all of that. I just wanted to make that clear. So I&#39;m gonna let you go ahead and keep moving forward. Okay. When we give high doses of vitamin D, I was talking about the initial dose of 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day.\n(56:22) This is usually our testing dose for diseases like, say, rheumatoid arthritis, to see how much the PTH will decrease when we increase the dose of vitamin D. But if I am treating a disease like psoriasis, I don&#39;t have to start giving that amount of vitamin D. I can give, say, for a patient who weights like 50 kilograms, I can give like 13,000 or 40,000 units per day as a testing dose because it&#39;s not an emergency, okay?\n(57:12) But that changes when I have an emergency. For instance, if I have a patient with multiple sclerosis who is having a severe disease, I can give that amount of vitamin D per day. For instance, who is at risk of losing his vision because of optical neuritis or just had an episode of optical neuritis like two weeks ago and is coming for the first appointment. So this is, to me, this is an emergency because I know that if I give high doses and I immediately increase the dose of vitamin D, the level of vitamin D to a high level, I know that I can reverse the visual loss that this patient has. So in this case, I would give to this patient a low dose of vitamin D. And what I&#39;m going to tell you has been published. If I don&#39;t, probably it was published by a group of Italian researchers in 2018. They showed if you give 600 milligrams of vitamin D or 600,000 units of vitamin D as a single dose orally, on day three, the patient will have a level of vitamin D which is around 18 nanograms per ml. And that, it means that I will normalize the level of vitamin D immediately by giving this loading dose. So, but I will not give this loading dose to a patient that comes for the first appointment and has only psoriasis. There is no emergency in that situation. I can check the level of resistance to that patient six months later and adjust the dose.\n(59:53) There&#39;s no rush in increasing the dose of vitamin D immediately. But in a patient in that situation, who had a flare of multiple sclerosis affecting his optical nerve, then I may give him this loading dose. I will definitely give him this loading dose because I don&#39;t want to miss the therapeutical window to reverse his visual disabilities. I need a high level of vitamin D to be achieved immediately so that I can get the effects of vitamin D in terms of remyelination of the optical nerve. Is that clear enough? So the initial dose may vary according to the patient&#39;s condition and to the type of disease that he is having. But we can have intoxication of vitamin D because using high doses of vitamin D because patients should follow a strict diet. They should not have dairy products in their diet and order diet items that have high level of calcium. So they have to follow this strict calcium diet.\n`
│   inner_content: `\n(32:45) Before we go on, are you going to talk a little bit more about what vitamin D resistance is? \nPatients who have autoimmune disorders, they have polymorphic changes affecting any combination of the nine genes that is required for vitamin D effects.\n(33:35) So we don&#39;t know the level of resistance that a specific patient may have. So we have to test it. So we give a testing dose that could be something like 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And so vitamin D starts increasing and it takes like three, four or five months to level off. So we measure PTH before starting vitamin D, the supplements with high doses of vitamin D and after five months. So at the end of this five months, we see how much vitamin D, when we increased vitamin D, how much PTH decreased. That was what I was trying to show you when I showed this. Suppose that this is the level of PTH that you have before the treatment, before taking 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And this is the level of PTH that you have five months later. So it should be just above the lower level of the reference range. If it has decreased below that level, so I have to decrease the daily dose of vitamin D. If it is far above the lower level of the reference range, so I still have to give more vitamin D as compared to what I was giving during this period of test, okay? So the first six months is like a testing period. We give a testing dose and we see how much the level of, I mean, how much the level of PTH will decrease. So at the end of these five months periods, when we receive the patients in a second appointment, then I look at the level of PTH and I have to calculate how much PTH, how much vitamin D, how much vitamin D I have to give in addition to that previous dose or how much vitamin D I have to decrease as compared to that previous dose. I don&#39;t know if I explained myself properly. Well, if you wouldn&#39;t mind going back to one of the slides that shows the immune cell.\n(36:52) One of my favorite presentations of yours was a presentation you did in Germany and you showed these slides that explained visually what happens like regarding the vitamin D resistance and why that leads to a decreased activity of vitamin D or a decreased response to vitamin D so that the more vitamin D resistance there is in an individual, the less vitamin D activity there is and the more vitamin D they&#39;ll need to overcome that vitamin D resistance. \n(38:11) So this is one of my first patients that I treated. She had SLE, and that was the result of only 10,000 units\n(39:02) of vitamin D per day after six months of treatment. So you imagine how impressed I was because that was the only change. The only change that I did in her treatment was to add vitamin D, 10,000 units per day. So you see her right face here, the difference between before and after the treatment, the left face. So here you see another patient with psoriasis. You see the psoriasis lesions affecting this area of her face.\n(39:55) And after six months taking 10,000 units of vitamin D, of vitamin D, you see this benefit that she had. You see the difference giving her 10,000 units of vitamin D within, after six months, you see how improved the lesions were. So this is the same patient. So here you have patients with multiple sclerosis. And she was born in 1982. And this is when she had the first flare of multiple sclerosis. So this MRI was taken in March 14.\n(40:56) And you see those lesions, those were recent lesions because it was her first flare. Okay, it&#39;s important to say that because vitamin D has also effects on the cells that produce myelin, which is called oligodendrocytes. So it promotes remyelination in multiple sclerosis. But that remyelination only occurs when you have recent lesions. When you have lesions that are older than one year, back when you start the treatment.\n(41:43) So it&#39;s more difficult to have remyelination of lesions. But that provides a comparison between March 2011 and July, 2012. More than one year had elapsed between one MRI and another. This lesions, those lesions were active in the first set of MRIs. I&#39;m not showing you this here, but they were making up a contrast. So you see here another patient who had a lesion, MS lesion affecting a critical area of the brain.\n(42:49) This lesion can cause severe symptoms and disability. It was a patient born in 1989. The first slide was taken, the first slide is on the MRI made in April 18, 2011. And the second slide was done about two years later, more than two years later. And you see the disappearance of that lesion. It was also a recent lesion. There were kind of lesions, old lesions here who had lesions, not so old lesions, but you see that maybe the spinal cord is a little bit swollen because of some lesions were present here, but they also had disappeared two and a half years later. So this is a severe type of multiple sclerosis. It&#39;s called Malon concentric sclerosis. It&#39;s a severe disease related to multiple sclerosis. Usually patients do not survive for more than two or three years after the diagnosis. And you see the first MRI that was taken in October, 2008.\n(44:30) And there were several MRIs in between, but like five years later, you only have the scar of those lesions and no additional lesion. So that was impressive to me. I was impressed with that case because as a neurologist, I know how Malon concentric sclerosis is a severe disease. So this slide is to show why we should not use the active form of vitamin D to treat those patients. So colicalciferol, which is the form of vitamin D that we give to patients orally, goes to the liver, undergoes the first hydroxylation, turning it into 25-hydroxy-D. This increase in 25-hydroxy-D has no effect, does not inhibit the 25-hydroxylase located in the liver. So the 25-hydroxy-D goes to kidney and to immune cells like mycophages, and you&#39;ll find one alpha hydroxylase in both sites in both cells. So they turned one alpha hydroxylase into a drug they turn in the 25-hydroxy-D into the active form of vitamin D. The kidney releases into the circulation, the blood serum, but the immune cells like mycophages use this active form of vitamin D to supply its needs. So it&#39;s not supposed to release in the circulation. So when one 25-hydroxy-D is released in the circulation, it inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. And this is an important step to prevent intoxication because the one 25-hydroxy-D is capable of increasing calcium levels to a very high level. So we should avoid having that. And when we give a cholecalciferol, you see that when the kidneys release the one 25-hydroxy-D, the one 25-hydroxy-D released in the circulation inhibits the renal enzyme. So one 25-hydroxy-D go to the intestines and bones and it releases calcium in the circulation and the release of calcium in the circulation further inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. But this has no, calcium level has no effect in the one alpha hydroxylase located in the immune cells. So that&#39;s the reason why we should use a cholecalciferol and not never use a one 25-hydroxy-D because if you use one 25-hydroxy-D, you will bypass all this controlling homeostatic mechanisms that this does not happen when you use cholecalciferol. So this is something important. It shows how one alpha hydroxylase works both in the kidneys and in immune cells and in several other tissues like the brain, placenta and several other tissues. So the reduced form of one alpha hydroxylase is capable of synthesizing one 25-hydroxy-D but it requires magnesium as a cofactor. But when it turns 25-hydroxy-D, D into 125-hydroxy-D, it gets oxidized. So in the oxidized form, one alpha hydroxylase cannot pick up another molecule of 25-hydroxy-D to turn it into the active form of vitamin D.\n(50:24) So it has to go back to the reduced form. This enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, comprising like more than 100 enzymes. And this family of enzymes have an auxiliary enzyme that is called reductase of the cytochrome P450. And this enzyme requires both the active forms of vitamin B2 as a prosthetic group. And it&#39;s capable of reducing the oxidized one alpha hydroxylase. When this occurs, the reductase is oxidized, but it is capable of reducing itself back to the reduced form of cytochrome P450 reductase. So this cycle has to go on, but in order for this cycle to go on, you need this cycle to go on. So in order to keep hydroxylating vitamin D to the active form, you need magnesium and vitamin B2. And it&#39;s important to know that like 10 to 15% of the world population has reduced the ability to absorb riboflavin. Several of those people have autoimmune disorders.\n(52:37) This was demonstrated by this article published in 1994. So this is extremely important to me because it&#39;s like 10% of the world population. It&#39;s important to say that high doses of colic alcephalol should be taken under the supervision of an experienced physician to avoid harm and renal function. \n\nReal quickly, Dr. Coimbra, can you just define what high doses?  Because some people consider high dose the 10,000 IU a day.\n(53:20) Is that the dose that you&#39;re talking about? Or are you talking about the doses that you use in your protocol, the 1,000 IU per kilogram, correct? Yes. Okay, 10,000 units per day is an amount of vitamin D that you can produce by solar exposure. So nobody has ever got intoxicated with vitamin D by exposing the skin to sunlight. So if you are lying down on horizontal position, you have a fair skin and the sun is high enough, your skin is a young skin, then you can produce this amount of vitamin D within like 20 minutes or 30 minutes. So it&#39;s hard to believe that people still believe that 10,000 units of vitamin D is a high dose of vitamin D considering that this is easily produced by exposing the skin to sunlight. So when I&#39;m talking about high doses of vitamin D, I&#39;m talking about the doses that we give to patients initially, which is 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. So this is a high dose. And maybe it could be called a therapeutic dose because it&#39;s what you&#39;re using to help treat these patients and not necessarily what somebody in the general population might take just to maintain their vitamin D levels. Never, the general population should not take this high dose of vitamin D. Only patients who have autoimmune disorders and under medical supervision.\n(55:41) I&#39;m glad we clarified that because the therapeutic use is a use that should be used with a medical device provider who is observing and watching for toxicity and measuring the PTH and all of that.

So if we have a patient with Graves&#39; disease, first we have to control the Graves&#39; disease by using proper medications that decrease the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. So it&#39;s extremely important to have hyperthyroidism under control before starting this treatment. Basildo-Reeves is autoimmune disorder and responds to high doses of vitamin D, but we cannot start high doses of vitamin D without controlling the release of large amounts of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland.\n`

So giving bifosfonate is a way to stop the intoxication immediately because you stop the releasing of calcium from the bones.\n`├── HeadingNode

In summary, that&#39;s what we do when we have a case of intoxication and all doctors that have been trained in our clinic are taught to use this protocol as part of their training. So those are the lab tests that we use whenever we have a case of intoxication. We order paratormon, obviously if the paratormon is above the lower limit of the normal range, the patient is not intoxicated because when calcium increases above the, it&#39;s upper level, upper level of normal range, when calcium is increasing, is increased, it inhibits the release of paratormon by parathyroid glands. So total and ionized calcium are one of the, those four items are blood tests and urinary tests that we always order in order to treat intoxications. TSH is also included here because of course, we want to know if the cause of intoxication is hyperparathyroidism that may begin at some point. So we also order urinary culture, culture of urine to assess sensitivity of antibiotics and we start antibiotics as soon as we receive a positive urine test, urine culture. \n\nSo this is related to your question.

Right. Okay. So this is something that we always give patients laboratory orders without a date, so that they can use it whenever they want, as it&#39;s necessary. Even before they contact us, they may start measuring calcium levels in their urine, because the urine, the calcium, the urinary calcium level is the first to increase. So if the urinary calcium is within the normal range, then it&#39;s unlikely that this patient has, is intoxicated with the vitamin D. And you also mentioned that the calcium usually comes from the bones. Do you ever see any effect on the bone health with this protocol? Yes. And this is an important question. When we increase, when we give a dose of vitamin D, like 10,000 units of vitamin D, you may expect to have increased the absorption of calcium to your bones. When you increase the dose of vitamin D to more than 20,000 units per day, then the effect on bones is both increasing the absorption of calcium, the assimilation of osteoblasts, and also the increase in the release of calcium from the bones due to the assimilation of osteoclasts. So at some point, you have both assimilation of osteoclasts and assimilation of osteoblasts.\n`

For instance, magnesium oxide cause a lot of diarrhea should never be used as a magnesium supplement for those reasons. Because most of the magnesium oxide are not absorbed. They remain in the bowels, within the bowels and high level, high concentrations of magnesium in the bowels cause diarrhea. So we use other types of magnesium compounds\n(1:35:01) like magnesium glycine, magnesium glycine, magnesium threonate. Do you use citrate or?

So I keep this high dose, a high dose of riboflavin, which could be something between 50 milligrams to a hundred milligrams, three or four times per day, to make sure that all those patients who have problems related to their absorption of vitamin B2 will have the benefit of receiving vitamin B2 in the larger doses that would overcome their poor ability, poor absorption, intestinal absorption of vitamin B2.\n(1:44:54) It&#39;s so important for that reason that I showed you in another slide, vitamin B2, the two forms of vitamin B2 is required for that auxiliary enzyme that is necessary for the function of the vitamin D hydroxylases. So this is something important, magnesium and vitamin B2 should be given to all our patients, at least those two additional supplements, but we also give omega-3, high concentration omega-3, and I think that&#39;s it.\n(1:45:51) Would you like to ask about any other supplements? Well, I was curious if you give any of the other B vitamins or if you ever adjust, I recently interviewed Dr. Stasia Gomenek about her protocol. \nShe&#39;s also a- Okay, I also give them, that&#39;s important, I also give them methylfolate and vitamin B12. Because lots of those patients have abnormalities related to folate cycle. And folate cycle is important for such a large amount of functions, biochemical reactions in our organism, including the production of glutathione. So we depend on a good folate cycle to produce glutathione, which is the main antioxidant mechanism in our organism, the main antioxidant defense in our organism. So I try to provide vitamin B12 and methylfolate, never use folic acid, folic acid should never be used, should never be administered to any patient, because like 30% of the whole population will have problems related to the administration of folic acid. Folic acid is not the normal vitamin B9 that is available in nature. It&#39;s produced by pharmaceutical companies as folate that is resistant to heat, but it should not be given to the whole population. No, and because like 30% of the whole population, the whole world population may have problems related to SNPs, related to folate metabolism, I always give them a methylfolate. \nSo it sounds like you are, you individualize treatment to your patient&#39;s specific needs. You adjust the co-nutrients according to your patient&#39;s individual needs. \n`

What I&#39;m seeing is impressive. Yeah, and we&#39;ll talk more about that a little bit later, especially. as it relates to autism. Do you, so you only measure the homocysteine to get an idea of the B vitamins, SNPs, or do you ever do any genetic testing? I measure homocysteine, especially in, in people who are, who are older than 40 years old. But since I started treating pediatric patients with, with autism, ASD, I was impressed to see that some of them have high levels of homocysteine. And the high homocysteine is related to which B vitamins? Is it just the folate, or is it also B12, or explain a little bit. Maybe related to B12 and B9. B9 is the methylfolate. But you see, vitamin B2 also plays a role in those folate cycles. And magnesium also plays a role.\n(1:51:25) So giving magnesium, giving vitamin B2 is giving, giving vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 in the form of methylfolate are important items of our protocol. Just a couple more questions on this topic, because the microbiome is an important piece in our overall health as well, especially when we&#39;re talking about autism. Do you ever address the microbiome as part of your protocols? And I believe if you&#39;ve got a healthy microbiome, your gut can actually produce a lot of these B vitamins. I&#39;m especially concerned about that when I treat patients with ASD. But in all patients, I advise them to have a healthy diet that will, because if your food is related to the type of microorganisms that you have in your bowels, right? In your intestines. So I suggest them to decrease as much as possible the amount of meat that they are eating and change the source of proteins to vegetable sources of proteins and eggs. If this is not sufficient, then try to use fish or other type of meat. And sometimes, yes, I do supplement those patients with probiotics. It&#39;s a major concern of ours. \n`

Okay, and we&#39;re talking retinol, right? Not the beta carotene, the precursors. Sorry? We&#39;re talking the preformed vitamin A, correct? Yes. Yes, okay. All right, so just to kind of wrap this little part up, when we&#39;re talking, you know, quote high doses of vitamin D is in no more than 10,000 IU a day. Do we need to concern ourselves if, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don&#39;t have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? \nWell, will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we&#39;ve just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight. Well, orally though, it&#39;s a little bit different. You know, our body&#39;s got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce. And it&#39;s, you know, produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they&#39;ve heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now. And I did not have that kind of problems in any patients, and you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So, I&#39;m really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use, and that&#39;s it. \nOkay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four, or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1,000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1,000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine, recommends only 600 units per day, and this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter, and this is completely normal. You can&#39;t have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, by higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, but it&#39;s still no, it&#39;s still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.\nTherefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve its biological effect effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. \n`

And we also treat patients with other kinds, other autoimmune disorders that may lead to blindness, like oviitis, for instance. We also give nine doses of vitamin D to those patients, and I might give a loading dose like that to those patients. So this is a way of classifying patients or classifying their situation as an emergency or not. So if it&#39;s an emergency, we have to use high doses of vitamin D. So, but I would like to to emphasize this, 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, only a minor change in the level of vitamin D as compared to someone who takes zero units per day. Zero units per day. And the IOM advised 600 units per day. So we see that this is an absurd, and I don&#39;t understand how this advice has remained for so many years, in spite of those publications like that, repeated publications. So the importance of vitamin D in pregnancy. I saw that this was one of your questions, and it&#39;s one of my main concern also. Vitamin D has numerous effects in pregnancy.\n(08:20) It&#39;s sufficient to say, as a preliminary information, that vitamin D is activated in the placenta, both in the maternal side of the placenta and in the fetal side of placenta. The placenta expresses that one alpha hydroxylase enzyme that turns vitamin D into 25-hydroxidine into the active form 125-hydroxidine. And this has microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. It will prevent a miscarriage due to autoimmune aggression against the fetal tissues.\n`

So we see that this is an absurd, and I don&#39;t understand how this advice has remained for so many years, in spite of those publications like that, repeated publications. So the importance of vitamin D in pregnancy. I saw that this was one of your questions, and it&#39;s one of my main concern also. Vitamin D has numerous effects in pregnancy.\n(08:20) It&#39;s sufficient to say, as a preliminary information, that vitamin D is activated in the placenta, both in the maternal side of the placenta and in the fetal side of placenta. The placenta expresses that one alpha hydroxylase enzyme that turns vitamin D into 25-hydroxidine into the active form 125-hydroxidine. And this has microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. It will prevent a miscarriage due to autoimmune aggression against the fetal tissues.\n`├── HeadingNode

And all those complications in pregnancy, you may have, if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. So you can imagine how much problems you may, the number, the amazing number of problems that you can prevent by just giving a pregnant woman an amount of 7,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is completely safe. It&#39;s important to say that some of our patients, MS patients, for instance, who were unable to get pregnant when they started receiving high doses of vitamin D, they got pregnant within a few months. So, and you have vitamin D and fertility, you have like more than 70,000 papers published related to that. As a neurologist, I&#39;m really concerned about fetal brain development. And I see that patients who are having 7,000 to 10,000 units or even high doses of vitamin D, as we use in our protocol, the neurodevelopment of those children are amazing.

This has been demonstrated in experimental animals, and probably they cross the placental barrier using the same mechanism of Trojan horse mechanism that you&#39;re seeing in the brain tissue. So that&#39;s it. If you have any other question, you can just ask me. The reason that I am trying to provide information about the role that aluminum nanoparticles are playing in the pathophysiology of ASD is quite clear to me, and we are facing an emergency. We could be using calcium phosphate nanoparticles that is even more effective as compared to aluminum nanoparticles in producing higher titers of antibodies. And I don&#39;t see any reason why you should not change the aluminum to calcium phosphate. In addition to that, it&#39;s quite clear to me that if you keep the level of vitamin D, circulating vitamin D that we had in the beginning, up to the beginning of the 80s, children had up to the beginning of the 80s, most of those vaccines would be not necessary.\n(1:13:43) We&#39;d decrease the number of vaccines that are required to be given to young children.

Now, that is not the nanoparticle form of aluminum, correct? So you&#39;re not necessarily worried about it getting into the brain as much as the lymph and causing issues outside, or am I incorrect? This was one of the slides that maybe I missed to mention. I&#39;m mismentioning that. But yes, the kind of aluminum that you apply to the people, apply to their skin to protect them from sunlight is nanoparticles of aluminum. And it&#39;s absorbed by the intact skin. Undamaged skin absorbs that aluminum. The amount of aluminum that is absorbed depends on how frequently you apply to your skin. There are people that apply sunscreen like three times per day, even when they are working in an office, believe you or not, they are not exposed to sunlight, they apply sunscreen to their skin. And the surface of your skin that you apply also plays a role, of course, regarding the amount of aluminum that you absorb in your skin. But yes, that&#39;s what I can say. The amount is variable depending on several variables, like those that I mentioned, the surface that you apply, the sunscreen, how often you apply, and the concentration, probably the concentration of aluminum is related to degree of sun protection that you have. Because the aluminum is used to reflect the sunlight and prevent them to enter the skin. And that&#39;s the reason why they reduced, almost abolished the production of vitamin D. Right.

Important to say that the concentration of aluminum that you have in the blood is 300 times less than the concentration that you have in the tissues, like in the brain. So the level of aluminum that you measure in the blood does not reflect what you have in the brain. And that&#39;s why when you start giving silica to those patients, you see that the first phase when aluminum in the blood increases and the level of aluminum in the urine also increases. Then there is a second phase when the level of aluminum is decreasing in the blood. Is it still increased in the urine? And the final phase, when you have undetectable levels of aluminum in the blood and in the urine. So this is a major point for us to address. `

And, when the patient has an autoimmune disorder, this contributes to deepen the emotional distress.

!!!!Transcript
(00:11) Okay, well, welcome, everybody, and a very special welcome to Dr. Coimbra, who is one of the world&#39;s most famous and appreciated doctors for using therapeutic levels of vitamin D to treat autoimmune disease and MS. And I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have you here, Dr. Coimbra. If you if we could start by having you tell us a little bit about your medical background. 
Yes, first of all, thank you for having me and for giving me this opportunity to talk about some such important issues. I was graduated in 1979 and I completed my medical residencies in internal medicine and adult neurology in southern Brazil, state of Rio Grande do Sul. From 1980 to 1984, I also did a fellowship in pediatric neurology. Yes, actually, it was between 1985 and 1986 at Jackson Memorial Hospital. In Miami. I earned my master&#39;s degree in 1988 and a PhD degree in neurology in 1990 from the Federal University of Sao Paulo. Aside from a two-year research period in experimental research at the University of Lund, Sweden, I have been practicing medicine since my graduation. I worked as an associate professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Federal University of Sao Paulo from 1997 until 2024. That&#39;s my background. 

Excellent, thank you. How did you first become interested in vitamin D as a neurologist and a practicing medical doctor? 
!!!!!When he started on Parkinson&#39;s in 1990: 300 papers on D and immune system, now 1000X more
Okay. By the year 2000, I had my first appointment with a patient with Parkinson&#39;s disease and he had several spots of vitiligo on his forehead. At that time, I was interested in therapeutic approaches that could enhance the synthesis of neurotrophic factors in brain tissue, as these factors could prevent neuronal degeneration. By that time, I had read about reports on the stimulatory effects of vitamin D on the production of neurotrophic factors. Seeking to help that patient neurologically, I prescribed 10,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cholecalciferol to see if his Parkinsonian symptoms could be better controlled. That daily dose was already established as no adverse effect level. When he came back six months later, his neurological state was about the same, but the vitiligo spots had almost completely disappeared.
(04:22) Then I searched medical literature and found __about 300 scientific papers__ discussing the importance of vitamin D for the immune system. Today we have more than __half a million papers on that subject__. That was when I started prescribing 10,000 units of vitamin D daily for patients with autoimmune disorders, not only MS, but mainly for MS patients because, as you know, I&#39;m a neurologist. And I was amazed the results were impressive just by giving them 10,000 units of vitamin D. At that time, I found a paper published in 1986 by Goldberg and co-workers from Boston reporting a reduced frequency of relapses in MS patients taking about 5,000 units of vitamin D in the form of cod liver oil. And they demonstrated it was just a simple research. They compared the frequency of relapses before giving them about 5,000 units of vitamin D and during the period when they were receiving that amount of vitamin D.

(06:08) And they found a reduced frequency of relapses. So that was the beginning of everything. Well, thank goodness you found that research. And I said, it&#39;s a good thing you found that research. I was looking for it. 

So are you going to explain in a little more detail about why vitamin D is important in the treatment of autoimmune disease? Did you want to get to that first or do you want to kind of just discuss a little bit more about how that evolved into what is now known as the Coimbra protocol?

(07:02) I would like to start explaining general issues about the importance of vitamin D for our organism. Okay, let&#39;s do the presentation now. Go ahead if you would like. Can you see the presentation? Yes. Okay. So this first presentation shows that vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB light, sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow.  So vitamin D is essentially synthesized in our skin when we are exposed to UVB sunlight. This occurs when the sun is high enough to produce a shadow that is not larger than our stage. If you are living in big cities, working in a confined environment and are not properly supplemented with vitamin D, then you are definitely vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D is actually a precursor of steroid hormone and can be turned into its correspondent active hormone in several of our cells, not only in kidney cells as most people believe. Okay. Dark-skinned individuals required about five to 10 times longer exposure to sunlight to produce vitamin D compared to fair-skinned individuals. So dark-skinned individuals living in high latitudes are likely to develop severe vitamin D deficiency and they are more susceptible to a wide range of apparently unrelated diseases like tuberculosis and hypertension. So at least in Brazil, the sunscreen was launched in 1960, in 1984. So, from that moment on, there were a lot of propaganda trying to make people to avoid any kind of, any minimal exposure to sunlight. And this had two consequences. For instance, if you use a protection factor of 8, that blocks approximately 95% of production of vitamin D.

(10:39) And if you use a factor of 15, then approximately 99% of the continuous production of vitamin D will be blocked. So in addition to that, the second consequence is that sunscreens can contain aluminum hydroxide coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles. And those nanoparticles can penetrate the intact skin. And aluminum is extremely toxic metal. That vitamin D is not actually a vitamin, it&#39;s a steroid hormone. It converts into a hormone in several of human cells and it&#39;s needed by nearly all cells for their functions. Low vitamin D levels play a role in the development of many diseases. So this is the number of just a few examples of diseases that are affected by the level of vitamin D that a person has. And you see it for general human health, you have almost 2 million papers already published. This led us to this publications by Stumpf in 2012, he said that vitamin D is as fundamental as the sun and the closest we have to a panacea.
(12:39) Regarding the immune system, we have more than half a million publications available in Google Scholar. And here is just a slide to demonstrate how important vitamin D is for the immune cells. Suppose that you have immune cells that has phagocyted mycobacterium tuberculosis. So it&#39;s within the cell and the cell has to destroy it. In order to do that, mycobacterium tuberculosis, as any other bacteria, is stimulated as toll-like receptors. And as a consequence of that, messages are sent, chemical messages are sent to the nuclei of immune cells. And this makes immune cells to express the 1-alpha hydroxylase, which turns the 25-hydroxy D to 25-hydroxy D, which is the active form of vitamin D. And this active form of vitamin D stimulates the vitamin D receptor. As a consequence of that, catechins are produced, and these are compounds that destroyed virtually any kind of microorganism that has invaded our body. So we see how important vitamin D is for the immune system. If we don&#39;t have vitamin D, then the bacteria like mycobacterium tuberculosis will remain alive within the immune cells. So if we look for vitamin D and infectious disease, this slide shows that by 2021, there were almost 300,000 peer-reviewed publications on the functions of vitamin D in the immune system. And today, in 2025, we have almost 400 papers published. Infectious disease, you see this large number of publications showing how vitamin D level is important to control all of those infectious diseases. I would like to show you an example of that by presenting Dr. Auguste Rollier. He died in 1954. He was a Swiss physician who treated tuberculosis in the first half of the 1900s, at a time when no effective antibiotics were available to combat that highly contagious chronic disease.
!!!!!TB Sanatoriums
(16:39) And he built up in the Swiss Alps at 2,000 meters above the sea level. He built up 36 edifices with large balconies, as you see here. And he used to treat tuberculosis by exposing his patients to sunlight. And the reason why he had to be 2,000 meters above the sea level is because he wanted to be above the clouds so that he would have sunlight throughout the year. So the treatment consisted of daily escalating solar exposure.

(17:48) His buildings were called sanatoriums. One sanatorium situated in Davos appears in the novel The Magic Mountains by Thomas Mann, who was first published in German in November 1924. This is an example of his results. On the left side of the slide, we observe a four-year-old patient with 34 foci of osteoarthritis, adenitis, like you will see here, numerous ulcers, as this one. I would like you to pay attention to this one, and tuberculomas affecting his right forearm.
(18:50) The patient also presents with advanced tuberculosis affecting both feet, the right hand, the left lung, and the abdomen. We call it peritonitis. He was extremely thin, had a lot of, he had lost a lot of body weight, and at a level that we call cachexia. His lower left shoulder suggests that he had also had rickets, and it&#39;s important to say that rickets, children with rickets frequently died because of tuberculosis, and at some point, some medical doctors thought that tuberculosis and rickets had the same origin. On the right side of the slide, we see the same patient one year later, healing of ulcers, deconstruction of bones, muscles, and the general condition. And you see that ulcer is now healed. At a time when the importance of vitamin D for our immune system was not known, Dr. Joliot credited the success of his treatment to exposure to sunlight and to the pure air of the mountains.

(20:47) The effectiveness of solar exposure in treating tuberculosis is evidenced by the establishment of sanatoriums in various locations worldwide, including the mountain regions of southern Brazil. However, at some point, the sanatoriums were fitted with glass windows and glass blocks the UVB rays, which are required for vitamin D synthesis in the skin. As a result, the sanatoriums ceased treating tuberculosis and were closed at a time when the first antibiotic for tuberculosis treatment, the injectable streptomycin was introduced to the market. Now sanatoriums turned into hotels in the Swiss mountains. So low vitamin D goes to low catalytic synthesis, allowing microbes to remain alive within the immune cells. And that leads us to the Trojan horse mechanism. We see here the structure of the blood-brain barrier,
(22:16) including the astrocytic podocyte, participating in this barrier. And we see that some virus like HIV virus, when you have low levels of vitamin D, they are not destroyed by the immune cells. And when the immune cells penetrate the blood-brain barrier, because they have the mechanism, those cells have the mechanism required for this penetration, it&#39;s carrying virus. So that&#39;s the way when the brain becomes infected by HIV and several other virus probably, like in some types of severe measles and like in polio, you also have the same mechanism. This is called the Trojan horse mechanism because the virus enters the brain within the immune cells. And by doing that, they bypass the blood-brain barrier. In September, 2018, the WHO called for urgent action to end the tuberculosis epidemic. Prior to the COVID epidemic, tuberculosis was the deadliest infectious diseases.
(24:07) It was killing like 2000 people per day worldwide. The combined use of multiple antibiotics to combine the antibiotic resistance has shown limited effectiveness nowadays. So autoimmune, this is an important issue to our protocol. Autoimmune diseases are almost always triggered by stressful life events. And managing emotional stress should be regarded as essential for the success of all therapeutic approaches, not only related to autoimmune diseases, but also to several other diseases. So then we are merged into this vicious cycle when emotional distress leads to reduced magnesium. And as magnesium is required for vitamin D activation, then you have reduced vitamin D activity. And that increases the possibility of acquiring an autoimmune disorder. And when the patient has a chronic disease, has acquired an autoimmune disorder, then this contributes to deepen the emotional distress. So reduced magnesium also causes excessive reaction to daily life problems and increases emotional distress. So this emotional distress disrupts the epigenetic control of dirty genes that we call the SNPs that we all have. We all have dirty genes, but they are usually switched off since prenatal life. And when we have a high level of stress, this in a way switch on those genes. So if you look for autoimmune disorders and stressful life events, we know we today have like more, almost 12,000 papers published. This is an example. Association between stressful life events and autoimmune disorders. Now going to vitamin D and autoimmune diseases, the issue of vitamin D and autoimmune diseases. We have more than 200,000 papers published. And so all those autoimmune diseases have tens of thousands of papers published relating them to low levels of vitamin D. So all the vitamin D works in autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disease is mediated by abnormal immune response, which is called TH17. There are almost 300,000 papers showing that this is the mechanism involved in the origin of autoimmune diseases. And vitamin D inhibits TH17. We have more than 3,000 papers, 3,000 papers showing the property of vitamin D related to inhibition of TH17. You see, it suppresses the TH17 cytokine production. This slide is to review the metabolism of vitamin D within immune cells. Vitamin D, cholecal sepharol is hydroxylated in the liver and released in the circulation. So vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-D enters the cell, undergoes a second hydroxylation within immune cells and the resulting 125-hydroxy-D stimulates a VDR, vitamin D receptor that inhibits TH17 programs and stimulates the proliferation of TH17. regulatory T cells. Okay, this is the same slide. So vitamin D and TH17, as I told you, we have like more than 30,000 publications. And how we adjust the dose of vitamin D. Here we have the parathyroid cells, a cell of one of the four parathyroid glands that we have close to our thyroid gland. And the vitamin D that is activated in the liver also enters the parathyroid cells. It&#39;s activated and simulate as VDR and the simulation of VDR by the active form of vitamin D inhibits the production of PTH, parathyroid hormone. So what we do in order to match the level of resistance that a person has to vitamin D is to measure PTH before the treatment and after five months of treatment. So when we increase PTH, when we increase vitamin D, PTH decreases and the goal is to decrease PTH to just above the lower level of the reference range for PTH. So PTH inhibition has two advantages as concerned to our protocol using high doses of vitamin D. It shows the level of individual resistance to vitamin D. And if PTH is not decreased below the lower level of the reference range, then this assures safety. It means that we are pretty sure that there will be no intoxication. Intoxication meaning increased level of calcium.
!!!!!Vitamin D Resistance
(32:45) Before we go on, are you going to talk a little bit more about what vitamin D resistance is? 
 Patients who have autoimmune disorders, they have polymorphic changes affecting any combination of the nine genes that is required for vitamin D effects.
(33:35) So we don&#39;t know the level of resistance that a specific patient may have. So we have to test it. So we give a testing dose that could be something like 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And so vitamin D starts increasing and it takes like three, four or five months to level off. So we measure PTH before starting vitamin D, the supplements with high doses of vitamin D and after five months. So at the end of this five months, we see how much vitamin D, when we increased vitamin D, how much PTH decreased. That was what I was trying to show you when I showed this. Suppose that this is the level of PTH that you have before the treatment, before taking 1000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. And this is the level of PTH that you have five months later. So it should be just above the lower level of the reference range. If it has decreased below that level, so I have to decrease the daily dose of vitamin D. If it is far above the lower level of the reference range, so I still have to give more vitamin D as compared to what I was giving during this period of test, okay? So the first six months is like a testing period. We give a testing dose and we see how much the level of, I mean, how much the level of PTH will decrease. So at the end of these five months periods, when we receive the patients in a second appointment, then I look at the level of PTH and I have to calculate how much PTH, how much vitamin D, how much vitamin D I have to give in addition to that previous dose or how much vitamin D I have to decrease as compared to that previous dose. I don&#39;t know if I explained myself properly. Well, if you wouldn&#39;t mind going back to one of the slides that shows the immune cell.
(36:52) One of my favorite presentations of yours was a presentation you did in Germany and you showed these slides that explained visually what happens like regarding the vitamin D resistance and why that leads to a decreased activity of vitamin D or a decreased response to vitamin D so that the more vitamin D resistance there is in an individual, the less vitamin D activity there is and the more vitamin D they&#39;ll need to overcome that vitamin D resistance. 
(38:11) So this is one of my first patients that I treated. She had SLE, and that was the result of only 10,000 units
(39:02) of vitamin D per day after six months of treatment. So you imagine how impressed I was because that was the only change. The only change that I did in her treatment was to add vitamin D, 10,000 units per day. So you see her right face here, the difference between before and after the treatment, the left face. So here you see another patient with psoriasis. You see the psoriasis lesions affecting this area of her face.
(39:55) And after six months taking 10,000 units of vitamin D, of vitamin D, you see this benefit that she had. You see the difference giving her 10,000 units of vitamin D within, after six months, you see how improved the lesions were. So this is the same patient. So here you have patients with multiple sclerosis. And she was born in 1982. And this is when she had the first flare of multiple sclerosis. So this MRI was taken in March 14.
(40:56) And you see those lesions, those were recent lesions because it was her first flare. Okay, it&#39;s important to say that because vitamin D has also effects on the cells that produce myelin, which is called oligodendrocytes. So it promotes remyelination in multiple sclerosis. But that remyelination only occurs when you have recent lesions. When you have lesions that are older than one year, back when you start the treatment.
(41:43) So it&#39;s more difficult to have remyelination of lesions. But that provides a comparison between March 2011 and July, 2012. More than one year had elapsed between one MRI and another. This lesions, those lesions were active in the first set of MRIs. I&#39;m not showing you this here, but they were making up a contrast. So you see here another patient who had a lesion, MS lesion affecting a critical area of the brain.
(42:49) This lesion can cause severe symptoms and disability. It was a patient born in 1989. The first slide was taken, the first slide is on the MRI made in April 18, 2011. And the second slide was done about two years later, more than two years later. And you see the disappearance of that lesion. It was also a recent lesion. There were kind of lesions, old lesions here who had lesions, not so old lesions, but you see that maybe the spinal cord is a little bit swollen because of some lesions were present here, but they also had disappeared two and a half years later. So this is a severe type of multiple sclerosis. It&#39;s called Malon concentric sclerosis. It&#39;s a severe disease related to multiple sclerosis. Usually patients do not survive for more than two or three years after the diagnosis. And you see the first MRI that was taken in October, 2008.
(44:30) And there were several MRIs in between, but like five years later, you only have the scar of those lesions and no additional lesion. So that was impressive to me. I was impressed with that case because as a neurologist, I know how Malon concentric sclerosis is a severe disease. So this slide is to show why we should not use the active form of vitamin D to treat those patients. So colicalciferol, which is the form of vitamin D that we give to patients orally, goes to the liver, undergoes the first hydroxylation, turning it into 25-hydroxy-D. This increase in 25-hydroxy-D has no effect, does not inhibit the 25-hydroxylase located in the liver. So the 25-hydroxy-D goes to kidney and to immune cells like mycophages, and you&#39;ll find one alpha hydroxylase in both sites in both cells. So they turned one alpha hydroxylase into a drug they turn in the 25-hydroxy-D into the active form of vitamin D. The kidney releases into the circulation, the blood serum, but the immune cells like mycophages use this active form of vitamin D to supply its needs. So it&#39;s not supposed to release in the circulation. So when one 25-hydroxy-D is released in the circulation, it inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. And this is an important step to prevent intoxication because the one 25-hydroxy-D is capable of increasing calcium levels to a very high level. So we should avoid having that. And when we give a cholecalciferol, you see that when the kidneys release the one 25-hydroxy-D, the one 25-hydroxy-D released in the circulation inhibits the renal enzyme. So one 25-hydroxy-D go to the intestines and bones and it releases calcium in the circulation and the release of calcium in the circulation further inhibits the one alpha hydroxylase located in the kidneys. But this has no, calcium level has no effect in the one alpha hydroxylase located in the immune cells. So that&#39;s the reason why we should use a cholecalciferol and not never use a one 25-hydroxy-D because if you use one 25-hydroxy-D, you will bypass all this controlling homeostatic mechanisms that this does not happen when you use cholecalciferol. So this is something important. It shows how one alpha hydroxylase works both in the kidneys and in immune cells and in several other tissues like the brain, placenta and several other tissues. So the reduced form of one alpha hydroxylase is capable of synthesizing one 25-hydroxy-D but it requires magnesium as a cofactor. But when it turns 25-hydroxy-D, D into 125-hydroxy-D, it gets oxidized. So in the oxidized form, one alpha hydroxylase cannot pick up another molecule of 25-hydroxy-D to turn it into the active form of vitamin D.
(50:24) So it has to go back to the reduced form. This enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P450 superfamily, comprising like more than 100 enzymes. And this family of enzymes have an auxiliary enzyme that is called reductase of the cytochrome P450. And this enzyme requires both the active forms of vitamin B2 as a prosthetic group. And it&#39;s capable of reducing the oxidized one alpha hydroxylase. When this occurs, the reductase is oxidized, but it is capable of reducing itself back to the reduced form of cytochrome P450 reductase. So this cycle has to go on, but in order for this cycle to go on, you need this cycle to go on. So in order to keep hydroxylating vitamin D to the active form, you need magnesium and vitamin B2. And it&#39;s important to know that like 10 to 15% of the world population has reduced the ability to absorb riboflavin. Several of those people have autoimmune disorders.
(52:37) This was demonstrated by this article published in 1994. So this is extremely important to me because it&#39;s like 10% of the world population. It&#39;s important to say that high doses of colic alcephalol should be taken under the supervision of an experienced physician to avoid harm and renal function. 

Real quickly, Dr. Coimbra, can you just define what high doses?  Because some people consider high dose the 10,000 IU a day.
(53:20) Is that the dose that you&#39;re talking about? Or are you talking about the doses that you use in your protocol, the 1,000 IU per kilogram, correct? Yes. Okay, 10,000 units per day is an amount of vitamin D that you can produce by solar exposure. So nobody has ever got intoxicated with vitamin D by exposing the skin to sunlight. So if you are lying down on horizontal position, you have a fair skin and the sun is high enough, your skin is a young skin, then you can produce this amount of vitamin D within like 20 minutes or 30 minutes. So it&#39;s hard to believe that people still believe that 10,000 units of vitamin D is a high dose of vitamin D considering that this is easily produced by exposing the skin to sunlight. So when I&#39;m talking about high doses of vitamin D, I&#39;m talking about the doses that we give to patients initially, which is 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day. So this is a high dose. And maybe it could be called a therapeutic dose because it&#39;s what you&#39;re using to help treat these patients and not necessarily what somebody in the general population might take just to maintain their vitamin D levels. Never, the general population should not take this high dose of vitamin D. Only patients who have autoimmune disorders and under medical supervision.
(55:41) I&#39;m glad we clarified that because the therapeutic use is a use that should be used with a medical device provider who is observing and watching for toxicity and measuring the PTH and all of that. I just wanted to make that clear. So I&#39;m gonna let you go ahead and keep moving forward. Okay. When we give high doses of vitamin D, I was talking about the initial dose of 1,000 units of vitamin D per kilogram per day.
(56:22) This is usually our testing dose for diseases like, say, rheumatoid arthritis, to see how much the PTH will decrease when we increase the dose of vitamin D. But if I am treating a disease like psoriasis, I don&#39;t have to start giving that amount of vitamin D. I can give, say, for a patient who weights like 50 kilograms, I can give like 13,000 or 40,000 units per day as a testing dose because it&#39;s not an emergency, okay?
(57:12) But that changes when I have an emergency. For instance, if I have a patient with multiple sclerosis who is having a severe disease, I can give that amount of vitamin D per day. For instance, who is at risk of losing his vision because of optical neuritis or just had an episode of optical neuritis like two weeks ago and is coming for the first appointment. So this is, to me, this is an emergency because I know that if I give high doses and I immediately increase the dose of vitamin D, the level of vitamin D to a high level, I know that I can reverse the visual loss that this patient has. So in this case, I would give to this patient a low dose of vitamin D. And what I&#39;m going to tell you has been published. If I don&#39;t, probably it was published by a group of Italian researchers in 2018. They showed if you give 600 milligrams of vitamin D or 600,000 units of vitamin D as a single dose orally, on day three, the patient will have a level of vitamin D which is around 18 nanograms per ml. And that, it means that I will normalize the level of vitamin D immediately by giving this loading dose. So, but I will not give this loading dose to a patient that comes for the first appointment and has only psoriasis. There is no emergency in that situation. I can check the level of resistance to that patient six months later and adjust the dose.
(59:53) There&#39;s no rush in increasing the dose of vitamin D immediately. But in a patient in that situation, who had a flare of multiple sclerosis affecting his optical nerve, then I may give him this loading dose. I will definitely give him this loading dose because I don&#39;t want to miss the therapeutical window to reverse his visual disabilities. I need a high level of vitamin D to be achieved immediately so that I can get the effects of vitamin D in terms of remyelination of the optical nerve. Is that clear enough? So the initial dose may vary according to the patient&#39;s condition and to the type of disease that he is having. But we can have intoxication of vitamin D because using high doses of vitamin D because patients should follow a strict diet. They should not have dairy products in their diet and order diet items that have high level of calcium. So they have to follow this strict calcium diet.
!!!!!Urinary Tract Infections
(1:01:40) And sometimes they just, they&#39;re doing so well that they just don&#39;t feel that this is important and they don&#39;t follow the diet strictly as they were recommended to. So one of the causes of intoxication is an unreliable source of vitamin D. Another cause of intoxication is urinary tract infections, particularly pyelonephritis, nephritis, nephritis. For some reason, when you have a urinary tract infection, even if you are not taking vitamin D, any supplement of vitamin D, your calcium level may increase.
(1:02:43) For some, there is a mechanism by which urinary tract infection decreases the urinary elimination of calcium. So it&#39;s an important part of the protocol is to prevent urinary tract infections. And because urinary tract infections are caused by microorganisms that are present in our feces, it&#39;s extremely important and extremely effective to wash the perianal area after having a bowel movement so that you remove all microorganisms from that area.
(1:03:47) Sometimes we may, for some patients who have recurrent urinary tract infections, after washing that area, they have to apply a topic antibiotic after washing that area. So poor compliance with dietary calcium restriction is another possible cause of intoxication. Hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, like in Basildo-Reeves disease or nodules in the thyroid gland that produce high levels, high amounts of thyroid hormones.
(1:04:45) This condition can, when it&#39;s associated with high doses of vitamin D, can lead to intoxication. And this is because thyroid hormones, just like vitamin D, they may remove calcium from our bones and the patient get intoxicated, not because of the calcium in their diets, but because of large amounts of calcium that are released in their bones in that condition. So if we have a patient with Graves&#39; disease, first we have to control the Graves&#39; disease by using proper medications that decrease the release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. So it&#39;s extremely important to have hyperthyroidism under control before starting this treatment. Basildo-Reeves is autoimmune disorder and responds to high doses of vitamin D, but we cannot start high doses of vitamin D without controlling the release of large amounts of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland.
!!!!!With high-dose Vitamin D need to avoid high-dose vitamin C, Lithium supplements
(1:06:25) So we found, this is for experiences, that when patients are taking very high doses of vitamin C, they may get intoxicated. And high doses of vitamin D, very high doses of vitamin C, reduce a kind of a situation called systemic oxalosis. So we advise patients under this treatment to avoid supplements of vitamin C higher than 250 milligrams per day. So we also found that lithium, this drug that is used in psychiatry, lithium can induce hyperparathyroidism.
(1:07:25) So it can increase the release of PTH in parathyroid hormones, and this can cause intoxication. So if you are at the same time using a high dose of vitamin D and you have a high level of PTH because you are taking lithium, and lithium increases the release of PTH by parathyroid hormones. 
So the use of lithium can cause intoxication when we are using this protocol. Real quick about vitamin C. Is it only vitamin C from supplements, or do you also have to worry about vitamin C from foods?
(1:08:33) Only from supplements. Patients can take as much vitamin C as they want by taking fruits and other foods like that. It&#39;s impossible to have very high levels of vitamin C taking those foods. No possible. Okay. And then can you clarify, because I thought you said supplements containing 250 milligrams of vitamin C, or was that 250,000 milligrams of vitamin C? Did I say 250? I believe so. No, please. It&#39;s 250 milligrams of vitamin C.
(1:09:22) Just to correct that. Patients should not take more than 250 milligrams of vitamin C per day as a supplement, but they can take any fruit containing vitamin C that will not cause any problem to our protocol. 
!!!!!Calcium levels, hydration, Magnesium
Okay. Thank you. So we also found that but these inhibitors can cause, can increase calcium levels. But at this point, I don&#39;t know the mechanism related to that. But we found that once someone, some patients started using those aromatase inhibitors for prevention of breast cancer, some of those patients got intoxicated with vitamin D. I mean, their calcium levels increased above the normal range. So we have a, I don&#39;t know if you would like to go through those steps, but we have a protocol. When intoxication happens, we have a protocol to use in order to induce a recovery from intoxication. Maybe it&#39;s not interesting to go into those steps. Let&#39;s go through it because we might have some practitioners who are interested in learning more and maybe even reaching out to you for training. Patients who are under this treatment, should be aware of symptoms of increasing calcium levels, such as persistent nausea and constipation. When that happens, they should stop taking not only nausea, isolated nausea or isolated constipation. But when the two symptoms are associated, then they should be concerned about the possibility of having high levels of calcium, circulating calcium. So the first measure is to stop taking vitamin D and all other supplements that we give to those patients, except for magnesium. This is important because magnesium is a natural calcium blocker. And it&#39;s important to keep the intake of magnesium supplements and sometimes even to increase that dose. So they have to increase the daily hydration for one more liter, because usually when the patients start on that treatment, we ask them to take at least 2.5 liters of liquids in general per day. But in that situation, when those two symptoms are associated, then we ask them to increase the daily hydration to at least 3.5 liters per day. So we doubled the daily amount of magnesium that we use in this protocol. We usually use a hundred milligrams of elemental magnesium three or four times per day.
!!!!!Furosemide, alendronate, bifosfonate also given
(1:13:35) And we have to double that amount. As another step, we start using furosemide, which is a diuretic drug, 40 milligrams. One tablet twice a day for one week and then reduced to once a week. We start supplementation of potassium to avoid the side effect of furosemide, 100 milligrams, one tablet twice a day for one week and then reduced to once a week. We also give them alendronate, bifosfonate, because bifosfonate immediately blocks the release of calcium from the patient&#39;s bones. And it&#39;s important to say that patients usually get intoxicated because of the calcium, the amount of the large amount of calcium that they are releasing from their bone tissue and not because of the diet. Usually it&#39;s not because of the diet, because you are usually following the diet. So giving bifosfonate is a way to stop the intoxication immediately because you stop the releasing of calcium from the bones.
!!!!!Weekly lab tests
(1:15:19) So we ask patients to collect blood and urine samples once a week as prescribed and they are sending those results to us as soon as the results are available. This is different as compared to what happens in US because who receives the laboratory results in US seems to be the doctor. In Brazil, patients and doctors have access to laboratory results. In summary, that&#39;s what we do when we have a case of intoxication and all doctors that have been trained in our clinic are taught to use this protocol as part of their training. So those are the lab tests that we use whenever we have a case of intoxication. We order paratormon, obviously if the paratormon is above the lower limit of the normal range, the patient is not intoxicated because when calcium increases above the, it&#39;s upper level, upper level of normal range, when calcium is increasing, is increased, it inhibits the release of paratormon by parathyroid glands. So total and ionized calcium are one of the, those four items are blood tests and urinary tests that we always order in order to treat intoxications. TSH is also included here because of course, we want to know if the cause of intoxication is hyperparathyroidism that may begin at some point. So we also order urinary culture, culture of urine to assess sensitivity of antibiotics and we start antibiotics as soon as we receive a positive urine test, urine culture. 

So this is related to your question. Can we pause for a moment and go back? And can you answer the question for me? Is vitamin D toxicity once the patient has shown symptoms, is, are all of those effects completely reversible or are there any permanent, is there any permanent damage from the vitamin D toxicity that these patients experience?
(1:19:11) If we start the treatment of, to reduce, to stop intoxication immediately, then everything is reversed. All damage to kidneys is maybe reversed. If we take a long time to start to do those, that detoxification protocol, then it might, the patient may have some damage to his renal function. But that&#39;s why we are deeply concerned about having the patients are aware that they should let us know. as soon as they are having those symptoms. And we gave them laboratory prescriptions.
(1:20:12) I mean, laboratory orders to so that they have laboratory orders to immediately collect the blood samples as soon as those symptoms started. Right. Okay. So this is something that we always give patients laboratory orders without a date, so that they can use it whenever they want, as it&#39;s necessary. Even before they contact us, they may start measuring calcium levels in their urine, because the urine, the calcium, the urinary calcium level is the first to increase. So if the urinary calcium is within the normal range, then it&#39;s unlikely that this patient has, is intoxicated with the vitamin D. And you also mentioned that the calcium usually comes from the bones. Do you ever see any effect on the bone health with this protocol? Yes. And this is an important question. When we increase, when we give a dose of vitamin D, like 10,000 units of vitamin D, you may expect to have increased the absorption of calcium to your bones. When you increase the dose of vitamin D to more than 20,000 units per day, then the effect on bones is both increasing the absorption of calcium, the assimilation of osteoblasts, and also the increase in the release of calcium from the bones due to the assimilation of osteoclasts. So at some point, you have both assimilation of osteoclasts and assimilation of osteoblasts.
!!!!!Physical exercise is needed to prevent bone loss (people in wheelchairs take a drug)
(1:22:43) And if you increase the dose of vitamin D further, like more than 40,000 units of vitamin D, you will increase, you will stimulate osteoclasts more than you will simulate osteoblasts. So the release of calcium will be increased in those patients. And in order to prevent that, the best measure to prevent that is to do physical exercise. Because if you have strong muscles, you have strong bones. You cannot have weak bones if you have strong muscles.
(1:23:36) This is the way that nature works. If you submit your bones to forces during physical exercise, like musculation, to increase the muscle mass, you will also increase the calcium level, calcium concentration in your bones. So it&#39;s extremely important. It&#39;s part of our protocol. Patients cannot remain at home just taking high doses of vitamin D. They have to do physical exercises. And I ask them to do physical exercises every day, especially those exercises that are  related to hip muscles. They are simulated to do that every single day, maybe twice a day, if possible, twice a day. And this is extremely effective to prevent the loss of calcium from the bone tissue. Is that what you were asking? Yes. An additional information. Okay. Some patients cannot do physical exercise because they are in a wheelchair for several years. They are in a situation of irreversible damage to their spinal cord, even years before they started this treatment. So I can ask them to do physical exercise. So in that case, I have to use medications that will stop the release of calcium from their bones at the same time when I started giving them a higher level of vitamin D. And it&#39;s something extremely important in regarding that question. 
!!!!!Stress and mental health
Is this when we started paying attention to the to the mental health of our patients, meaning when we started to ask them, asking them to control their emotions by controlling their thoughts, because you are under stress because of the thoughts that you are accepting in your mind because of the problems that you are facing. But if you learn techniques on how to control your thoughts as a way to control your stress, I can see that those patients do not require those high levels of vitamin D. And I see in the in the laboratory tests that I have to decrease the level of vitamin D, the doses of vitamin D, because they seem to be no longer so resistant to vitamin D as they were before. And this, that&#39;s why the control of emotions has become the basic of this, this therapy. I don&#39;t want to keep patients on high doses of vitamin D forever. I want to decrease their daily doses of vitamin D. And I can decrease their daily doses of vitamin D if they decrease the level of stress. So this is part of the treatment.
(1:28:05) I have several patients that are no longer taking high doses of vitamin D because they learned how to control their emotions. So techniques like mindfulness are very important to those patients. And we ask them to look for information like that. And I don&#39;t know if I could transmit how important this is for this protocol. It&#39;s not about giving them high dose, only about giving high doses of vitamin D to match the level of resistance. This can be the first step.
!!!!!Stress, inflammation decrease in about a month
(1:28:50) But as time goes by, the patient is now aware that he is not, he is no longer having those symptoms that he had before. And one of the most important symptoms is fatigue, fatigue at rest. Fatigue at rest almost disappeared after one month of treatment. And this is a way of measuring the strength of an inflammatory, a systemic inflammatory condition. A systemic inflammatory conditions cause fatigue at rest.
(1:29:40) So if this is decreased after one, one month of treatment, I know that the inflammation, inflammatory process is becoming under control. And that&#39;s a question that I consistently ask to all patients. What&#39;s your level of fatigue in a scale from zero to 10? Because when they come back, I will ask that question again. Another question that I ask patients is something like this. Suppose there is a scale, an imaginary scale of stress that goes from zero to 10.
(1:30:33) Zero does not exist, would be someone that does not get stressed for anything. So that does not exist. But a level five would be the average level of stress that a person of the, an average person of the population has. And a person that is facing common problems, irregular problems, ordinary problems. And level 10 is the maximum level of stress that a patient may have, that someone may experience. So I ask the patient, what&#39;s your level of stress?
(1:31:22) And it&#39;s unbelievable. There is no patients that were happy, calm and happy when they got sick. It&#39;s unbelievable. And when they got sick, they were facing a stressful life event that was much higher than the stressful life event that they used to face in their lives. So when they start, when they have the first appointment, this is another question that I ask right now, what is your level of stress in that scale from zero to 10?
(1:32:09) Because when they come back, I&#39;ll ask them again to see if they could decrease the level of stress. And if they could not decrease the level of stress, I will reinforce the importance of this in order to live a normal life without having to take high doses of vitamin D. This is a really good point and important to know about the Coimbra Protocol, that it&#39;s not just about giving very high therapeutic doses of vitamin D.
(1:32:46) It&#39;s adjusting lifestyle in terms of exercise, emotional health and diet. And all of those, wow, wow. So you can actually get them off of the therapeutic vitamin D if they can control their stress. That&#39;s pretty phenomenal. 
Yes, they can. But sometimes there are patients that are unable to control their stress no matter how much you talk about. But we are always trying in every appointment. And I would say that most patients are now realizing how important this is for the success of the treatment. 

Do you utilize any other nutrients or interventions to specifically address stress for those individuals who have a hard time just controlling their mind and behavior? Magnesium itself has this effect. What was it? Magnesium itself has this effect. So the dose of magnesium is adjusted according to the maximum dose that a patient can have and take without having diarrhea.
!!!!!Magnesium types – 100 mg 3X per day
(1:34:12) So it&#39;s important to say that some magnesium salts are not suitable for any treatment like that. For instance, magnesium oxide cause a lot of diarrhea should never be used as a magnesium supplement for those reasons. Because most of the magnesium oxide are not absorbed. They remain in the bowels, within the bowels and high level, high concentrations of magnesium in the bowels cause diarrhea. So we use other types of magnesium compounds
(1:35:01) like magnesium glycine, magnesium glycine, magnesium threonate. Do you use citrate or? No, I don&#39;t use citrate because citrate increases the absorption of aluminum in our food. So aluminum is a terrible metal, so I don&#39;t use citrate. So citrate is avoided and magnesium oxide is avoided, should be avoided. And we adjust the dose, as I told you, we adjust the dosing according to the bowel movements. The patient should be having bowel movements every day
(1:36:05) at least once a day, but without diarrhea. If they are not having bowel movements every day, they should increase the dose of magnesium. If they have diarrhea, they should decrease the dose of magnesium. So magnesium is given as within multi-vitamin supplement that I give the patients, but just the basic daily dose of magnesium, which should be around 100 milligrams of magnesium three to four times per day within that polyvitamin compound.
(1:37:00) But I give an additional magnesium to adjust the dose according to the bowel movements. So, the literature related to magnesium supplementation says that you have to adjust the dose according to bowel movements, okay? So I think that this is really important to say that some other supplements can reduce stress. One of the supplements that can reduce stress is glycine. Glycine is amino acid and it can reduce stress.
(1:37:50) So we used to use magnesium glycine as a preferential form of magnesium. But if I want to have more effects in the central nervous system, I might use magnesium trionate. If I want to increase the release of, if I want to detoxify aluminum, aluminum today is a major, major concern of ours in this protocol, because we are seeing a lot of patients with problems related to aluminum. But we can get back to this subject in a while if you want.
(1:38:55)  I had a few other questions about other co-nutrients, but I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re already planning on getting there. For example, you talked about the B2, you&#39;ve also mentioned omega-3s, and then a lot of people ask about vitamin K, and there&#39;s questions about vitamin A. So if you want to save those for later. 
(1:39:28) Well, let me rewind a little bit and ask you, because I think there&#39;s a misconception that taking very high doses, or just high doses, not even therapeutic doses of vitamin D can induce deficiency of another nutrient. But the way that I like to refer to it, or several of our other scientists have referred to it is that correcting vitamin D deficiency vitamin D deficiency and taking that 10,000 IU of vitamin D a day as the high dose simply reveals inadequacies of other related nutrients. So it&#39;s not necessarily causing another nutrient such as magnesium or any of the B vitamins to become deficient. It&#39;s just showing that the intake is already too low to support normal function. Would you agree with that? Or are there any specific nutrients that you also concern yourself with when you&#39;re putting your patients on higher vitamin D? Well, I try to increase the capacity of fighting inflammation in my patients.
!!!!! Omega-3 Three times a day
(1:40:57) So the omega-3 that you have mentioned is part of our protocol. So we give them omega-3, high concentrated omega-3 three times a day as part of our protocol. So they will produce their own anti-inflammatory substances. Regarding vitamin K2, 15 years ago, we tried to give vitamin K2 as MK7 to try to prevent loss of calcium in the bones of patients under high doses of vitamin D under our protocol.
(1:41:58) But it was useless, this did not work. So it only made the protocol more expensive. So I gave up using vitamin K2. When you didn&#39;t see any buildup of calcium in the arteries or any other tissues that it wasn&#39;t supposed to be? If you keep the calcium level, circulating calcium level within the normal range, there is no reason to be concerned about calcification of tissues. Tissues may calcificate if you have high levels of calcium in your circulation.
(1:42:45) So I try, I keep the level of calcium within the normal range by using the diet and other measures, but I don&#39;t use vitamin K2. I understood that it was useless. It did not change anything, laboratory tests, bone mass were not changing. 
!!!!!Do you put all of your patients on B2 and other B vitamins? And for how long? 
Well, as I showed you, like 10% of the world population cannot absorb vitamin B2  properly. So I keep this high dose, a high dose of riboflavin, which could be something between 50 milligrams to a hundred milligrams, three or four times per day, to make sure that all those patients who have problems related to their absorption of vitamin B2 will have the benefit of receiving vitamin B2 in the larger doses that would overcome their poor ability, poor absorption, intestinal absorption of vitamin B2.
(1:44:54) It&#39;s so important for that reason that I showed you in another slide, vitamin B2, the two forms of vitamin B2 is required for that auxiliary enzyme that is necessary for the function of the vitamin D hydroxylases. So this is something important, magnesium and vitamin B2 should be given to all our patients, at least those two additional supplements, but we also give omega-3, high concentration omega-3, and I think that&#39;s it.
(1:45:51) Would you like to ask about any other supplements? Well, I was curious if you give any of the other B vitamins or if you ever adjust, I recently interviewed Dr. Stasia Gomenek about her protocol. 
She&#39;s also a- Okay, I also give them, that&#39;s important, I also give them methylfolate and vitamin B12. Because lots of those patients have abnormalities related to folate cycle. And folate cycle is important for such a large amount of functions, biochemical reactions in our organism, including the production of glutathione. So we depend on a good folate cycle to produce glutathione, which is the main antioxidant mechanism in our organism, the main antioxidant defense in our organism. So I try to provide vitamin B12 and methylfolate, never use folic acid, folic acid should never be used, should never be administered to any patient, because like 30% of the whole population will have problems related to the administration of folic acid. Folic acid is not the normal vitamin B9 that is available in nature. It&#39;s produced by pharmaceutical companies as folate that is resistant to heat, but it should not be given to the whole population. No, and because like 30% of the whole population, the whole world population may have problems related to SNPs, related to folate metabolism, I always give them a methylfolate. 
So it sounds like you are, you individualize treatment to your patient&#39;s specific needs. You adjust the co-nutrients according to your patient&#39;s individual needs. 
!!!!!Folate helps eliminate aluminum (a major health problem)
Yes, I do. But your question is very important. I am always concerned to keep myself in a good state of folate metabolism, which is demonstrated by homocysteine levels. And it&#39;s a major factor related to the elimination, detoxification of metals like aluminum. Aluminum is a major, perhaps the major health problem worldwide. I&#39;m not exaggerating. What I&#39;m seeing is impressive. Yeah, and we&#39;ll talk more about that a little bit later, especially. as it relates to autism. Do you, so you only measure the homocysteine to get an idea of the B vitamins, SNPs, or do you ever do any genetic testing? I measure homocysteine, especially in, in people who are, who are older than 40 years old. But since I started treating pediatric patients with, with autism, ASD, I was impressed to see that some of them have high levels of homocysteine. And the high homocysteine is related to which B vitamins? Is it just the folate, or is it also B12, or explain a little bit. Maybe related to B12 and B9. B9 is the methylfolate. But you see, vitamin B2 also plays a role in those folate cycles. And magnesium also plays a role.
(1:51:25) So giving magnesium, giving vitamin B2 is giving, giving vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 in the form of methylfolate are important items of our protocol. Just a couple more questions on this topic, because the microbiome is an important piece in our overall health as well, especially when we&#39;re talking about autism. Do you ever address the microbiome as part of your protocols? And I believe if you&#39;ve got a healthy microbiome, your gut can actually produce a lot of these B vitamins. I&#39;m especially concerned about that when I treat patients with ASD. But in all patients, I advise them to have a healthy diet that will, because if your food is related to the type of microorganisms that you have in your bowels, right? In your intestines. So I suggest them to decrease as much as possible the amount of meat that they are eating and change the source of proteins to vegetable sources of proteins and eggs. If this is not sufficient, then try to use fish or other type of meat. And sometimes, yes, I do supplement those patients with probiotics. It&#39;s a major concern of ours. 
!!!!!Added Vitamin A to increase cellular Vitamin D
__[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-vitamin-a-increase-the-am-pszR9Zz3RWWBznPueNV9Jw|Not confirmed by AI March 2025]__
One more question about other nutrients, because there are certain groups that believe taking high doses of vitamin D can deplete your vitamin A. Do you ever concern yourself with vitamin A? As you are asking questions,
(1:53:51) I am reviewing what I&#39;m doing. Yes, I told you that- Boiler alert. Yes, you remember that I told you that I give patients a compound of vitamins and vitamin A is included to that because in order to vitamin D has its actions at the level of__ vitamin D receptor__ within the nucleus, vitamin A will be required. So this is also added to our supplement of vitamin A like 500 micrograms three times per day is part of our protocol nowadays.
(1:54:46) Maybe several years ago it was not, but now it is. Okay, and we&#39;re talking retinol, right? Not the beta carotene, the precursors. Sorry? We&#39;re talking the preformed vitamin A, correct? Yes. Yes, okay. All right, so just to kind of wrap this little part up, when we&#39;re talking, you know, quote high doses of vitamin D is in no more than 10,000 IU a day. Do we need to concern ourselves if, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don&#39;t have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? 
Well, will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we&#39;ve just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight. Well, orally though, it&#39;s a little bit different. You know, our body&#39;s got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce. And it&#39;s, you know, produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they&#39;ve heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now. And I did not have that kind of problems in any patients, and you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So, I&#39;m really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use, and that&#39;s it. 
Okay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four, or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1,000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1,000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine, recommends only 600 units per day, and this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter, and this is completely normal. You can&#39;t have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, by higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, but it&#39;s still no, it&#39;s still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.
Therefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve its biological effect effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. 
!!!!!COVID 600,000 IU of Vitamin D
As I told you, in case of an emergency, like during an epidemic, or the pandemic that we experienced a few years ago, an initial dose of 600,000 units of vitamin D should be given orally, and depending on the body weight of that person, it should, it could be repeated in the next day to achieve the desirable level of 80 nanograms per ml immediately, because it&#39;s an emergency. Well, I thought, I already told you that I also considered an emergency patient with MS.
!!!!!! - - - - -Must add about 120 minutes to the times after this point
(00:06) If, you know, for example, if I take 5,000 IU of vitamin D a day, do I have to concern myself with these other nutrients if I don&#39;t have any symptoms that reveal a current inadequacy? Will taking that amount deplete or cause a deficiency of any of these other nutrients that we&#39;ve just talked about? By giving vitamin D? Yeah, 5,000, 10,000 at most a day. You produce that amount by exposing your skin to sunlight.
(00:35) Well, orally, though, it&#39;s a little bit different. You know, our body&#39;s got built-in mechanisms with how much vitamin D we produce, and it&#39;s produced over a longer period of time. But I just want to address this because there are certain people who are afraid to take oral vitamin D because they&#39;ve heard that it can create other deficiencies. I have been using high doses of vitamin D for more than 20 years now, and I did not have that kind of problems in any patients. And you can count thousands and thousands of patients that I have seen during these years. So I&#39;m really not concerned about this. What I told you, those supplements that I told you about are those that we use. And that&#39;s it. Thank you. 
All right. Well, I&#39;ll let you carry on with your presentation. Thank you so much. 

Welcome. So do you see that slide? Okay, this slide shows that vitamin D, when you give doses like 1000 units of vitamin D per day, your level of vitamin D will essentially will not change throughout, say, three, four or five months. It was not, it will not change significantly. This graphic shows that even a daily dose of 1000 units will not significantly change the circulating levels of vitamin D after several months of supplementation. Taking 1000 units of vitamin D, maybe being regarded as a high dose, just because the IOM, the Institute of Medicine recommends only 600 units per day.
(02:41) And this is nothing. 600 units per day is nothing. The graphic also shows that when you give 10,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is no adverse effect level, you will reach 80 nanograms per ml, which is equivalent to 200 nanomoles per liter. And this is completely normal. You can&#39;t have, if you are not resistant to vitamin D, you will not have the full effect of vitamin D with levels below 60 nanograms per ml, or 150 nanomoles per liter. People who, with low levels, with low body weight, may achieve levels significantly higher than that, higher than 80 nanograms per ml by taking 10,000 units of vitamin D per day. But it&#39;s still no, it&#39;s still no adverse effect level. Vitamin D is a fat soluble steroid, and fat tissues act as a sponge, a kind of sponge, so absorbing vitamin D from the circulation.
(04:32) Therefore, in a person with increased fat tissue, the daily requirement of vitamin D needed to achieve this, its biological effect, effects also has to be increased. Some people with obesity may have to take like 20 or 25,000 units of vitamin D per day to achieve this level of 80 nanograms per ml. As I told you, in case of an emergency, like during an epidemic or the pandemic that we experienced a few years ago, an initial dose of 600,000 units of vitamin D should be given orally. And depending on the body weight of that person, it could be repeated in the next day to achieve the desirable level of 80 nanograms per ml immediately, because it&#39;s an emergency. Well, I already told you that I also considered an emergency patient with MS who is at risk of blindness, and then because of optical neurites. And we also treat patients with other kinds, other autoimmune disorders that may lead to blindness, like oviitis, for instance. We also give nine doses of vitamin D to those patients, and I might give a loading dose like that to those patients. So this is a way of classifying patients or classifying their situation as an emergency or not. So if it&#39;s an emergency, we have to use high doses of vitamin D. So, but I would like to to emphasize this, 1,000 units of vitamin D per day, only a minor change in the level of vitamin D as compared to someone who takes zero units per day. Zero units per day. And the IOM advised 600 units per day. So we see that this is an absurd, and I don&#39;t understand how this advice has remained for so many years, in spite of those publications like that, repeated publications. So the importance of vitamin D in pregnancy. I saw that this was one of your questions, and it&#39;s one of my main concern also. Vitamin D has numerous effects in pregnancy.
(08:20) It&#39;s sufficient to say, as a preliminary information, that vitamin D is activated in the placenta, both in the maternal side of the placenta and in the fetal side of placenta. The placenta expresses that one alpha hydroxylase enzyme that turns vitamin D into 25-hydroxidine into the active form 125-hydroxidine. And this has microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. It will prevent a miscarriage due to autoimmune aggression against the fetal tissues.
!!!!!7,000 IU of Vitamin D daily during pregnancy reduces the risk of many offspring health problems
(09:23) So the same article that I was mentioning here by Liu and Hewson also showed all those situations that you may have if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. And I would emphasize the maternal-fetal HIV transfer, autism, multiple sclerosis. just later on in this individual life. Type, the risk of diabetes in childhood if the mother had low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy, and asthma. And all those complications in pregnancy, you may have, if you have low levels of vitamin D during pregnancy. So you can imagine how much problems you may, the number, the amazing number of problems that you can prevent by just giving a pregnant woman an amount of 7,000 units of vitamin D per day, which is completely safe. It&#39;s important to say that some of our patients, MS patients, for instance, who were unable to get pregnant when they started receiving high doses of vitamin D, they got pregnant within a few months. So, and you have vitamin D and fertility, you have like more than 70,000 papers published related to that. As a neurologist, I&#39;m really concerned about fetal brain development. And I see that patients who are having 7,000 to 10,000 units or even high doses of vitamin D, as we use in our protocol, the neurodevelopment of those children are amazing. It&#39;s amazing, amazing.
!!!!!Children born of parent with high vitamin D have high IQs, are happier, etc. 
(12:09) They are not only have a high IQ, they are happy child, children. It&#39;s amazing, they are completely different to (other) children. So, I&#39;m always wondering what will happen with humankind when the advice of giving 10,000 or at least 7,000 units of vitamin D during pregnancy, what will happen with humanity? Because we&#39;ll have a completely different kind of human beings, as I have seen during this 20 years when I started using this protocol.
(13:06) But I have to say that this benefit may be lost but I have to say that this benefit may be lost due to administration of vaccines containing aluminum nanoparticles in pregnancy and in large amount, increasingly amounts of vaccines that we are giving to children. So, if you don&#39;t mind, we can go into this issue. Let&#39;s just pause for a moment. Is this gonna be the last set of slides on autism? Or did you have, because I really do, for the practitioners who are interested in going through the training for the Coimbra Protocol. I really wanted you to share a little bit more about what&#39;s involved with that. I know I sent some questions from our own scientist panel and some of the other doctors in our network, but I would like to just kind of turn the conversation from that for the general public to those who are in the medical field who might wanna come and learn more from you.
!!!!!Training Coimbra Protocol Doctors in 5 days, no charge
(14:39) So, you are asking about training for other doctors, is that what you mean? Yeah, I sent some questions about the training and the protocol, such as what is the cost of participation and what is the curriculum? How many hours does it take? You know, if you could just kind of share a little bit about what is expected for those who want to be trained, because we don&#39;t have enough Coimbra Protocol practitioners in the United States. So if there- You have five of them. I trained five medical doctors. I think that four medical doctors and a lady, an osteopathic lady that works in the US. I&#39;m not sure how many of them are still working. I have received messages only from a few of them, but we never charged anything for medical doctors who came to Brazil to have a period of training. This usually takes a week, actually five days, from Monday to Friday.
(16:16) They see me treating patients, and they ask questions, and I respond to those questions as deeply as I can. But there is no charge. They have to only to deal with travel expenses, or hotel expenses, but nothing is charged by myself. I don&#39;t charge anything for that. I stopped training doctors during the pandemic, and I&#39;m now planning to resume those trainings, but I have to adjust my schedule to resume those trainings, because you see, you have a patient in the room, you have myself, you have one or two, or sometimes three doctors asking questions at the same time when I&#39;m seeing those patients and prescribing to those patients. But I try to do as much as I can. 

Is there any other question that you had about that? 
Well, do you have any idea when you&#39;re going to resume training, and how will we know, and then how would somebody get ahold of you to arrange to come and be a part of that? 

Maybe in the second half of this year. There are several issues now going on in my professional life, and related to that, I&#39;m receiving demands from doctors who had a period of training here, and every now and then they ask questions about the cases that they are seeing. But I&#39;m trying to do the best I can. Okay. So they could email you and arrange that, and then you&#39;ll be able to respond.
(18:46) Yeah, during those five years, there is a huge list of emails that have been sent asking for a period of training. But I&#39;m the only doctor in this clinic that is providing this clinic in English. And so it&#39;s a lot of work. You need to train more trainers. Train more trainers, yeah. But it has to be feasible too. 

One more curiosity before we move into autism. Did you see a lower incidence of COVID, severe COVID deaths among your patients who were on the high doses of vitamin D, the therapeutic doses? 
!!!!!None of the Protocol patients receiving high dose of Vitamin D got COVID
In patients who were receiving high doses of vitamin D, none of them had COVID. In patients who were receiving what I consider the normal dose of vitamin D, which is 10,000 units, for someone who has a normal body mass index, they had only mild manifestations of COVID. There is thousands of publications now showing that low levels of vitamin D are related to severe cases of COVID and advising supplementation of COVID. When the COVID-19 started in 2020, I advised, I even recorded a clip that was published by one of my colleagues in the Facebook. In that video clip, __I advised all patients to take 600,000 units of vitamin D immediately__ and started 10,000 units per day afterwards. 
!!!!!Major setbacks when his patients got mRNA COVID vaccines
Some patients that were on high doses of vitamin D and had their autoimmune disorder under control, they had flares, MS patients had flares and new lesions when they took those mRNA vaccines. And that was kind of disappointing because, those were patients that were having a normal life for like 10 years and then they had those shots and then suddenly they have a new flare, a new lesion, active lesion. And we had to deal with this and that caused us a lot of problems.
(22:20) That was one of the issues that increased the amount of work and contributed to stop receiving other doctors for a period of training in our clinic. Did I answer your question or? Yes, yes, absolutely. If you don&#39;t mind, yes, absolutely. 
Okay, so I&#39;ve been in touch with Dr. Renu Mittani, who was also trained with you and I know she&#39;s training in India and I&#39;m not sure about training in other parts of the world, but would you encourage others to seek her and others who are possibly also training the other doctors in the Coimbra protocol to reach out to them? 
Yes, definitely. Dr. Renu Mittani is a very clever and efficient lady. She is doing a wonderful work training other doctors and I definitely need other doctors to train doctors so that I&#39;m the only one to be trained. I&#39;m the only one.
(24:16) I don&#39;t want to be the only one person training doctors in this so-called Coimbra protocol as it&#39;s now known by my patients. Definitely, I would encourage her to continue. She&#39;s been in touch with me because of that and I have already encouraged her to go on with that activity. So she&#39;s got your full support. That&#39;s good to know.
 One concern that she brought up, and I&#39;m curious if this is also a concern for you in Brazil, is that some doctors, some practitioners who are doing the high dose, the therapeutic dose, vitamin D, there&#39;s some concern on their end for legal or lawsuits, legal actions taken for patients who do reach that toxicity. Has that ever been a concern for you? Have you had to deal with that in your practice? Or what is something that you could tell doctors who are, or do you already tell practitioners who are doing this to? Well, you understand that we are facing opposition from the medical community. And it&#39;s been like that since we started with this protocol. We started with this protocol. But I have to deal with this. This is something that I, it&#39;s part of my routine now. And I, what can I say? 
!!!!!Riboflavin (B2) + Magnesium may treat most migraines, but are not used by doctors
For instance, if you go to the to Scholar Google, and you type migraine, and you type riboflavin, you will see that there are thousands of publications showing that high doses of riboflavin, like 400 milligrams per day, control migraine in 80% of cases. And if you increase, if you add magnesium to that treatment, you will reach close to 100% of cases under control. And you&#39;ll see that there is placebo control groups, studies using placebo control groups, randomized placebo control groups, everything that is suggested or indicated by the so-called evidence-based medicine.
(27:22) But there is not a single word about riboflavin in the textbook of the medical doctor that treats migraine. So, it&#39;s my opinion that the transmission of knowledge within the medical community is under strict control. And it seems to me that any kind of new therapy that is addressing the cause of diseases and carries the possibility of decreasing the commercialization, the trade of medicines, they seem to be excluded from textbooks and medical meetings.
!!!!!It does not matter if you have 100,000 publications – (if there is no profit from it)
(28:33) So, it doesn&#39;t matter if you have thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of publications, they are not mentioned. So, I don&#39;t have anything to do about that. I just have to keep my work, to do the best I can for my patients. And when there is some litigations, I have to try to deal with that in the best way I can. But I cannot be stressed because of that, because I know that stress triggers diseases. So, it really has to be part of the routine. Even Dr. Mittani has received criticisms from her peers. So, I think that this is expected. It&#39;s not something that you should be surprised to see about that. Maybe in some countries like the U.S., The pressure on medical doctors may be higher than in other countries, for obvious reasons. Most pharmaceutical companies are located there, but it&#39;s something, it&#39;s a problem that we have to face. Because I bet you&#39;ve probably seen the amount of effectiveness that comes from the use of therapeutic doses of vitamin D, how effective it is. And I&#39;m assuming, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, that it&#39;s probably safer than a lot of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market for some of these diseases that you&#39;re treating with vitamin D. I&#39;m sure about that. The medicines that are sold to treat autoimmune disorders are very expensive, very, very expensive. There is one medication for MS that five tablets cost like $46,000 in US.
(31:23) So you can imagine what is happening, when you, what would happen when someone tries to provide another treatment that instead of causing depression of the immune system, enhances the power of the immune system in fighting infections. And there is something else that I have to add, some other information. Most of, when they say that in order to be accepted by the medical community, you have to perform a placebo-controlled, randomized placebo-controlled study, multicentric.
!!!!!Not willing to have a control group of people not getting Vitamin D in an RCT
(32:25) We don&#39;t have money to make a multicentric study. I would never ask some relative of mine to take part of a study like that using, just to prove that vitamin D given in high doses controls those autoimmune disorders. Because I know that those patients who fall in the control group will be damaged and will be damaged forever. So I don&#39;t feel comfortable about that. I would never do that. And another issue is that this type of study is impossible.
!!!!!RCT would be impossible anyway, as his protocol must adjust the dose, etc for each patient
(33:21) It would not be blinded, double-blinded, because you have to adjust the dose according to the resistance of the patient. So you have to see the laboratory results and adjust the dose according to those laboratory results. That&#39;s not possible in terms of placebo-controlled studies, double-blind placebo-controlled studies. Right. So that&#39;s it. We have to go on and do as much benefit to our patients as possible.

(34:07) Yeah. And in the meantime, you know, those who do take this into practice can rely on other doctors like you, Dr. Matani, and the many very knowledgeable vitamin D researchers, such as those on the grassroots health panel. We&#39;ve got a great community of individuals who are well aware of what&#39;s going on. Dr. William Grant, for example, wrote the Vitamin D Misinformation Playbook, and he talks about this a lot.

(34:42) And you just can&#39;t let that scare you. And just have faith that this really does work. Yes. Some other doctors that were trained in our clinic also have published about the safety of the Coimbra Protocol. And they have other doctors like those were, I guess it was from Germany, they produced two papers. And there is another paper published by Italian groups of medical doctors showing the improvement of quality of life.
(35:29) Those patients having under high doses of vitamin D. So I&#39;m glad to see that other doctors are planning to publish that because I cannot do everything on my own. 
!!!!!Parkinson&#39;s is NOT an autoimmune disease, and they have very high levels of stress
 ~hs~ ~hs~ Note: [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-parkinson-s-an-autoimmune-d-mFE80OKPRrGk2bMzmerx3g|Parkinson&#39;s may be an Autoimmune Disease (data since 2017)]

That brings me to a question that one of our doctors sent me, and I hope you don&#39;t mind my asking you now, but Dr. Patrick Niccolo has published several papers. He is a medical doctor. He&#39;s been using high doses of vitamin D with all of his patients in the hospital that he works at, and he was wondering if you would be willing to collaborate with him on treating patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. That is one of the things that he would like to speak with you about, the therapeutic doses of vitamin D on Parkinson&#39;s and then publish it. 
I&#39;m glad that you asked that question. I&#39;m open to cooperate with any doctor, any physician, but I have to say that __Parkinson&#39;s disease is not an autoimmune disorder__, and we don&#39;t use this high dose of vitamin D protocol in Parkinson&#39;s disease. Parkinson&#39;s disease is one of the most cases of diseases that we see __very, very high level of stress in those patients__. They have ever been extremely worried about all problems that they face. They are highly responsible people. They don&#39;t want to accept that things are not under possible bad outcome. The outcomes of the problems that they are facing escape their control. They are trying to control everything.
(37:56) They are afraid of things that may happen. They think about every possible outcome of any problem they are facing. This is essentially the personality that is seen in almost 100% of patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease. And we have been dealing with Parkinson&#39;s disease by trying to change that personality. Of course, we give vitamin D, not in high doses, what I call high dose. I&#39;m not sure what you are calling high doses in your question, but I&#39;m giving like 10,000 15,000 units of vitamin D to patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease because several years ago I tried to give them high doses of vitamin D and I felt it did not work. So we are trying other measures to decrease the activity of that disease, like giving glycine in __high doses of glycine__, which is an amino acid that decreases, that causes calmness, induces calmness. We are associating that with any acetylcysteine (NAC).
(39:43) Also it seems to be working in the first few patients. I hope that impression goes on, but Parkinson&#39;s disease is not an autoimmune disorder. And I guess that this confusion came from the fact that doctors that were here to be trained on high doses of vitamin D, because I&#39;m a neurologist, I was also seeing patients with Parkinson&#39;s, lots of patients with Parkinson&#39;s. And maybe there&#39;s this impression that Parkinson&#39;s disease is responsive to high doses of vitamin D. That&#39;s not my impression, but we correct the level of vitamin D in those patients too, because of the effects of vitamin D has in the central nervous system in the brain, inducing neurotrophic factors that increase the lifespan of neurons. So that&#39;s what I have to say about that. No other information I have available. 
Thank you so much for discussing that topic.
!!!!!Autism – started treating in 2014, Bradford Hill (dose response, happening everywhere – Vaccines?)
(41:11) Okay, I would love if you would continue on to the topic of autism. Are you ready? I started treating autism in 2014. And the reason why I started using, treating children with __ASD__ was because there were publications showing benefits of vitamin D in autism, and also papers showing that TH17 is active in children with autism. So we started using high doses of vitamin D in autism, and we got very good results. But then afterwards, at some point,
(42:17) I faced with this undeniable relationship with autism, and the increasing number of vaccines that we&#39;re giving to children. As you see here, in 1970, you had one child with autism, or in 10,000, non-autistic children. So in 2018, you had like one in 36. Today in US, you have like one in 22. And in Brazil, it seems that we are having like one in 10 patients. This is a tragedy. And so we started investigating what could be causing this sharp increase, the rate of autism. And in order to do that, we had to use the method that was published in 1965 by a British epidemiologist. His name was Austin __Bradford Hill__. And he said, he published a set of criteria that should be used to demonstrate that one factor is causing one disease. And thanks to that, he was able to prove that smoking was a cause of lung cancer. And since then, the criteria of causation of Bradford Hill is used in several other instances. So you could use to try to find out the cause of the explosion of autism. And according to those criteria, there&#39;s one criteria that is called the dose response criteria. So if, for instance, if smoking caused lung cancer, if I increase the number of cigarettes that I smoke per day, I will increase the risk of having lung cancer. This is dose response. I increase the dose, I will have an increased response.
(45:22) So if you want to find a factor that is causing autism, you have to find this factor that you are looking for has to follow the dose response criterion of Austin Bradford Hill. In other words, you have to find something that is increasing, some toxic agent to which children are more and more exposed. And the more you expose children to that factor, you increase the response, which is autism. It&#39;s like increasing the number of cigarettes
(46:11) in a certain population, smoking in a certain population, you would increase the response which would be the lung cancer. So looking for a factor like that, we have to realize that this factor should be applicable to all countries in the world because the explosion of autism is happening everywhere. It&#39;s not something that is happening in Brazil. It&#39;s not something that is happening only in the US or in Britain or Australia or any other country.
!!!!!Autism is increasing around the world (along with vaccines) 
(46:57) __So it has to be some factor that is happening everywhere__, that is occurring everywhere. So what has occurred everywhere in all countries is the increase of number of vaccines given to children. So this timeline goes from 1967 to today. To 2012, and you see that by 1985, you had less than 70, less than 70% of children given like five vaccines or five shots of vaccines. In the second half of the 80s, it was the period when the sunscreen appeared and a lot of pressure, a lot of advertising so that people should avoid any kind of exposure any kind of solar exposure. And at the same time, they should be using sunscreen sometimes even if you are under artificial light. So the level of vitamin D dropped suddenly here in the whole population. And when between 1989 and 1990, 1991, there was an outbreak of measles that killed a lot of children, much unusual as compared to previous years when you had no limitations to expose yourself to sunlight. And as a consequence of that, you see that there were more and more and more vaccines. And as you increased the vaccines and the percentage of children covered with those vaccines when you were having more vaccines and more than 90% of children vaccinated. When this was happening, the number of cases of autism also increased. So the increasing of vaccines could be preliminarily accepted as a possible cause of autism, but
 only that criterion does not prove that vaccines can cause autism. You may remember that it was like nine criteria. 
!!!!!Criteria of mechanism: found Aluminum in brains of people who died with ASD
So you need another criteria, the __criteria of mechanism__. So if vaccines cause autism, then there should be a mechanism by which vaccines are causing autism. So in order to find that, you have to look at the composition of vaccines, and all those vaccines that you see here and you give to children have aluminum nanoparticles in their composition. The vaccine given to prevent, to prevent the virus that causes cervical cancer, infection to that virus, also has aluminum salts. So then maybe you have a mechanism if you try to see if aluminum is toxic. So you look, you go to look, scholar Google, and you see that there are __more than two million papers talking about or discussing about the toxicity of aluminum__. Aluminum is toxic even to plants, not only to animals or human beings.
(52:23) So then you may, then now you have a mechanism that strengthens the possibility that vaccines can be caused. Then you need a final, or what I consider to be a final proof that vaccines can really be accepted as a cause of autism. You have to find aluminum nanoparticles, because the type of aluminum that you inject in vaccines are nanoparticles of aluminum. It&#39;s not a soluble type of aluminum that you ingest when you drink water.
(53:17) When you drink water, you are ingesting soluble salt of aluminum and less than 1%, I mean like 0.25% of this aluminum salt that you ingest is absorbed, only 0.25%. And most of that aluminum that is absorbed is easily extracted, eliminated in the urine. That&#39;s not what happens when you inject aluminum nanoparticles. Aluminum nanoparticles are used in vaccines because they cause inflammation. And they have the antigens attached to those particles.
(54:20) So the immune cells phagocyte those particles, and that&#39;s the beginning of the process of producing antibodies. So if aluminum causes autism, and the aluminum of vaccines causes autism, then you have to find particles of aluminum in the brain tissue of children with autism or individuals with autism. And that was what these researchers from the United Kingdom have done. They published this in 2018 ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29413113/|Aluminium in brain tissue in Autism] [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13283697388213251461&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en|Cited 217 times]). They went to the University of Oxford because the University of Oxford has a bank of brains.
(55:29) Perhaps for the last 70 years, any patient who died in the hospitals that were affiliated to Oxford University and died with a neurological disease of unknown cause, they had their brains fixed with formalin, removed and stored in a bank of brains. So they went to that bank of brains, and they got samples of the brains of individuals that had died, not because of the diagnosis of autism, but with autism.
(56:27) And what they found is this, we can read individuals with a diagnosis of __ASD__ have extraordinarily high levels of aluminum. This is the British way of aluminum in their brain tissue. So you see what they found in their brains, they found particles of aluminum. In immune cells, this is a lymphocyte, this is a macrophage that has several nanoparticles of, several particles of aluminum inside. So to me, as a medical doctor, since I was graduated, I was taught to give the highest level of importance to what pathologists find in the microscope. They usually have the final word, they say, okay, I was, I looked at the tissue and I found the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. So your patient has tuberculosis, and no one will ever discuss, argue, no one will ever argue against that statement, because it&#39;s like you saw the criminal in the scene of crime stabbing the victim, so to speak.
(58:23) So I have to give them the highest level of importance to this finding. So to me, it&#39;s quite clear that what is causing autism is the presence of aluminum in vaccines. And it&#39;s an absurd, because you could use other nanoparticles, like calcium phosphate nanoparticles, and reports about the effects of calcium phosphate nanoparticles is that they may cause even higher production of antibodies as compared to aluminum nanoparticles.
(59:21) So it&#39;s difficult to understand why, if this is being published everywhere, in several papers, in several scientific papers, and the pharma company that produces vaccines continue using aluminum nanoparticles in their vaccines, in their products. So as I told you, the fate of these nanoparticles, of these nanoparticles are completely different from that, that you see regarding soluble salts of aluminum that you ingest. They are biopersistent.
(1:00:10) Maybe we can remember that figure that I showed you demonstrating that I, um, a liquefied can cross the blood-brain barrier, carrying a virus, and thereby it would infect the, the nervous system. And this is called a __Trojan horse mechanism__. So, if you imagine that this is not a viral particle, but actually, actually an aluminum nanoparticle, you understand why and how the aluminum nanoparticles bypass this barrier and reach the nervous system, the brain, and why it is found as particles within immune cells, like you see here. So, that&#39;s what I was telling you about aluminum causing inflammation, attracting immune cells to injection site. Aluminum nanoparticles contain antigens that absorb it. Their surfaces are phagocytized or engulfed by leukocyte, thereby triggering antibody synthesis. This is called adjuvant effect of nanoparticles. There is a chronic encephalitis associated with __ASD__, and this can be demonstrated by measuring the level of this enzyme called neuro-specific enolase or NSE. Just like when the liver is inflamed, when there is an inflammatory process affecting the liver, the liver cells release their enzymes in the bloodstream. The same thing happens when you have an inflammatory process affecting the brain. Neurons release, the damaged neurons release this enzyme called neuro-specific enolase. Okay.
(1:02:52) The inflammation that is caused by the presence of __aluminum nanoparticles breaks the blood-brain barrier so that now it&#39;s toxins and microbes can have access to the brain tissue__. The adjuvant effect of aluminum nanoparticles induces antibody synthesis against the brain tissue. This has been published. You see, neuro-specific enolase has been proposed as a biomarker of autism spectrum disorder. Many publications about that, more than 10,000 publications.
(1:03:48) Here you&#39;ll see 12,600 publications showing there&#39;s brain-specific autoantibodies in the plasma of subjects with autistic spectrum disorder. So this is also published. So if you try to combine everything that you know about the pathophysiology of __ASD__, everything is explained by the toxic effect of aluminum. Even the wide range of metabolic disorders that you find in children with aluminum, in children with __ASD__, I&#39;m sorry.
(1:04:59) Everything is explained on the basis of the toxic effects of aluminum nanoparticles. So __ASD__ fulfills the criteria to be classified as an autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. This syndrome was first reported by Schoenfeld and Agmon-Levy in 2011. And they emphasized this, factors entailing an immune adjuvant activity, such as infections agents, silicone, aluminum salts, and others were associated with defined and non-defined immune mediated diseases.
(1:06:05) So adjuvants can cause autoimmune diseases, can trigger autoimmune diseases. And that&#39;s exactly what is happening in the brains of children with __ASD__. They have inflamed brain. Aluminum nanoparticles is within immune cells in their brain. They are infiltrating their brain. And it&#39;s definitely ASIA syndrome. So it&#39;s important to emphasize the question, the issue about infections. Infections agents can induce an autoimmune disorder, not immune disease.
(1:07:04) And this is exactly what happens regarding the MMR vaccine, because I&#39;ll talk to you, talk about that in a moment. This slide shows that interleukin-17 is elevated in the serum of children with autism, just like in any other disease, any other autoimmune disease. So autism and vitamin D releases more than 27,000 publications because vitamin D suppresses TH17 cytokine production. So looking at that picture produced by Rome City, showing that pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines cannot be sued due to a law that was approved in US in 1986. And the number of vaccines containing aluminum that is given simultaneously in a two-month-old baby, I cannot accept that as something that should be considered normal. So this slide shows that regarding the hepatitis B vaccine, the amount of aluminum that is given to a child in the first day of life is equivalent to the amount of aluminum present in 10 shots of the same vaccine given to a 70-kilogram adult person.
(1:09:45) And if you go, if you now go to a baby that is only two-month-old and the baby receives this amount of aluminum per kilogram of body weight, and __this is equivalent to 24 vaccines given in a single day to a 70 kilogram adult__. This is not acceptable. Here you see the year of 1986, when this National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was approved in US. You see the number of shots that children were having or receiving in 1983.
(1:10:43) And in the number they were receiving in 2023, 76 shots. And now you see that in 2024, it was like 88 doses. So moreover, it&#39;s important to say that during pregnancy, during pregnancy, the flu vaccine, the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine, and the RSV vaccine containing aluminum nanoparticles is given to pregnant women and may cross the placental barrier and accumulate in the fetal brain. This has been demonstrated in experimental animals, and probably they cross the placental barrier using the same mechanism of Trojan horse mechanism that you&#39;re seeing in the brain tissue. So that&#39;s it. If you have any other question, you can just ask me. The reason that I am trying to provide information about the role that aluminum nanoparticles are playing in the pathophysiology of ASD is quite clear to me, and we are facing an emergency. We could be using calcium phosphate nanoparticles that is even more effective as compared to aluminum nanoparticles in producing higher titers of antibodies. And I don&#39;t see any reason why you should not change the aluminum to calcium phosphate. In addition to that, it&#39;s quite clear to me that if you keep the level of vitamin D, circulating vitamin D that we had in the beginning, up to the beginning of the 80s, children had up to the beginning of the 80s, most of those vaccines would be not necessary.
(1:13:43) We&#39;d decrease the number of vaccines that are required to be given to young children. I&#39;m open to your question. I have two. And my first question, you mentioned the amount of aluminum particles in sunscreen, and I know that women are concerned about aluminum in their deodorant. Now, that is not the nanoparticle form of aluminum, correct? So you&#39;re not necessarily worried about it getting into the brain as much as the lymph and causing issues outside, or am I incorrect? This was one of the slides that maybe I missed to mention. I&#39;m mismentioning that. But yes, the kind of aluminum that you apply to the people, apply to their skin to protect them from sunlight is nanoparticles of aluminum. And it&#39;s absorbed by the intact skin. Undamaged skin absorbs that aluminum. The amount of aluminum that is absorbed depends on how frequently you apply to your skin. There are people that apply sunscreen like three times per day, even when they are working in an office, believe you or not, they are not exposed to sunlight, they apply sunscreen to their skin. And the surface of your skin that you apply also plays a role, of course, regarding the amount of aluminum that you absorb in your skin. But yes, that&#39;s what I can say. The amount is variable depending on several variables, like those that I mentioned, the surface that you apply, the sunscreen, how often you apply, and the concentration, probably the concentration of aluminum is related to degree of sun protection that you have. Because the aluminum is used to reflect the sunlight and prevent them to enter the skin. And that&#39;s the reason why they reduced, almost abolished the production of vitamin D. Right. Okay, so it&#39;s not like the aluminum that we ingest. It actually is not excreted like the aluminum we ingest.
(1:17:00) It&#39;s absorbed and could possibly harm the brain and cause issues, not even related to __ASD__, but other neurological issues. If this could cause other neurological issues, not only. Yes, they can cause any autoimmune disorder. It can cause learning difficulties. And it&#39;s good that you asked about that because the elementary schools are falling apart all over the world at the same time when the autism is raising because children in Australia, Spain, United Kingdom, probably in U.S., yes, in U.S. too, they are not being able to learn almost anything. I received a teacher of the elementary school and I asked her what percentage of her students she could pass information they could learn. And she said that it would be only 15%. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that this is a disaster because those children will be the adults of tomorrow and they will have to support society. And they will have to support those who have major disabilities like the severe cases of autism. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that we are facing a global emergency. We have to stop that. Otherwise, human society will not be feasible, would not be possible to exist as in the way that we know today. I cannot be more in fact, I cannot emphasize this subject more than I have than in our interviews, in our interview.
(1:19:47) So I expect you to pass the message. 
Yes, one last question. Besides strengthening the immune system and making these vaccines less needed. Is there any other role of vitamin D in reducing the effects of the aluminum or other toxins that might decrease the risk of these resulting diseases, whether it&#39;s __ASD__ or autoimmune diseases that are caused or likely caused by the toxins? 
Yes, vitamin D definitely reduced the risk but does not prevent these to occur. Even in patients, pregnant women who were taking high doses of vitamin D during pregnancy, they may have children with __ASD__ due to the vaccines that the children received afterwards. Another issue that came to my mind is to say that when a pregnant woman is taking those high doses of vitamin D that we are taking, the baby is born with high levels of vitamin D, very, very high levels of vitamin D.
(1:21:29) And the calcium levels is at the upper limit of the normal range. But they don&#39;t have any problems related to that. Afterwards, vitamin D is decreasing. And the level of calcium remains within the normal range. And the mother also provides vitamin D by breastfeeding. So if she is taking high doses of vitamin D, the baby will also receive high doses of vitamin D by when they are breastfed. But this has not caused any problem to our children.
(1:22:31) See, have I answered all questions? 
!!!!!Silica removes aluminum from the body – reduces depression, ADHD, MS etc.
 ~hs~ ~hs~ see also ((Aluminum appears to increase MS, Alzheimer&#39;s, etc. - silica water removes it))
There is something else. Well, a final one, just similar topic, because there are some cases of autism that have potentially been treated with high dose vitamin D. Is that something that you&#39;ve also treated? And is it addressing the aluminum toxicity in the brain? And this might be a whole other topic, but just a brief answer, __if you are aware of vitamin D reversing the effects of the aluminum toxicity__.
~hs~ ~hs~&#39;&#39; See VitaminDWiki: ((Silica reduces Aluminum in the body - perhaps reducing MS, ADHD, Alzheimer&#39;s etc.))&#39;&#39;
(1:23:12) High doses of vitamin D in children with autism, it&#39;s also an autoimmune disorder. You see, you saw that there are high levels of auto antibodies against the brain. So we give high doses of vitamin D. That was the beginning of the treatment when we started treating those children in 2014. But now we also __try to eliminate aluminum nanoparticles by giving silica__. And we can see that the level of concentration of aluminum increases in the urine and in the blood at the beginning of the treatment. Important to say that the concentration of aluminum that you have in the blood is 300 times less than the concentration that you have in the tissues, like in the brain. So the level of aluminum that you measure in the blood does not reflect what you have in the brain. And that&#39;s why when you start giving silica to those patients, you see that the first phase when aluminum in the blood increases and the level of aluminum in the urine also increases. Then there is a second phase when the level of aluminum is decreasing in the blood. Is it still increased in the urine? And the final phase, when you have undetectable levels of aluminum in the blood and in the urine. So this is a major point for us to address. __We have to eliminate aluminum__. There is something else that just came to my mind and I think you would be interested to know about. When we started treating patients with __ASD__, at the same time, we were also treating young people with autoimmune disorders, like MS, for instance, like rheumatoid arthritis. And then we added to the protocol because they were born after 1990. __We added silica to the protocol. __So this is a major addition to our protocol. We are trying to detoxify aluminum in all our patients.
(1:26:59) And we are amazed to see how much aluminum they are eliminating in the urine when you start giving silica. And this is something that will decrease the process of inflammation in all autoimmune disorders. So this is a major addition to the treatment. Last year, in the last two years, I would say, 2023, 2023, 2024, I was amazed to see because I always ask about all diseases that occur in the family of patients.
(1:27:55) And I was amazed to see the number of young people and adolescents with severe depression, severe depression. Nowadays, children, I would say, a five-year-old, if you have a classroom with like 20 five-year-old children, most of them are taking antidepressive drugs at five years of age. This is unbelievable. This is really unbelievable. I had a case of a young lady that came with her mother. Her mother was an MS patient.
(1:29:02) And this patient, at some point, her mobility started getting worse and worse with more and more difficulties related to her walking ability. And at some point in May, 2023, she had an appointment and she was requiring the support of a cane on the right side and the support of the arm of someone to be able to walk. So she was getting worse and worse during the previous two years. And I told her that all MS patients that I have that are getting worse, in spite of having high levels of vitamin D patients with MS. All those patients that are getting worse, even taking high doses of vitamin D are adjusted according to the laboratory tests, pH level. All of those that are getting worse were having a high level, a very high level of stress. So I asked her, what&#39;s your level of stress? Because you are getting worse and worse during the last two years. And she said, in a scale from zero to 10, __her level of stress was 10__. So I asked her, what was the reason for that? And she said, it was because of her daughter. And I asked her, what was happening with her daughter? And she said that her daughter was taking antidepressant drugs since she was four years old. And at some point in her adolescence, she started cutting herself, self-mutilation.
(1:31:37) And she had attempted suicide twice. So that patient told me that when her daughter was leaving to go to school, she would not be able to say for sure if she was coming back or not. So that was the reason of her high level of stress. So I asked the girl, the young lady to come in and ask her to try to stop that behavior because her mother was getting worse. And she said that she would do everything that she could because she loved her mother very much. But I gave her silica because when she started having when she started with depression, she was taking a large number of vaccines. Well, she came back one year later and I could not recognize that young lady. She was completely different. She was well-dressed. Her hair were completely, were well combed. I can&#39;t say that, describe that. I did not recognize her. She was happy.
(1:33:34) She was smiling. And I asked her if she was, how was her depression? And she said that she was 85% better. And her psychiatrist was decreasing the doses of medications that were, that he was, had prescribed. She was taking four medications to keep her alive. And the psychiatrist was decreasing the doses of psychiatric drugs. So I asked her why, what was the reason why she was cutting herself? And she said something that we&#39;ll never forget.
(1:34:34) She said that she had to cause pain to herself to stop paying attention to the pain, psychological pain of having depression. Psychological pain of having to live. That was the reason why she was causing pain to herself. But she was not doing that anymore. And she had plans for the future. So that was the first case. But then there were two more other cases and the same result. So we are now seeing an epidemic of self-mutilations among adolescents and young adults. This is happening everywhere. We have seen an epidemic of suicide in several countries. So imagine what this is, the problem, I was, there is a principle, a principle that was proposed more than 1,000 years ago. And it&#39;s considered to be the first principle of statistics and says when several things are happening in the same place with the same persons, probably they have one cause, one single cause. This is called the __principle of parsimony__. And it&#39;s used in several, if not all sciences, including in the daily medical practice. To explain all symptoms signs and the laboratory abnormalities that you see in a patient and explain with one single diagnosis. It&#39;s called the principle of parsimony. And if we apply the principle of parsimony to all things that we are seeing in our society, in several countries at the same time, autism, __ASD__, depression, we can find, we have to find one single explanation. And that&#39;s to me, that is the presence of aluminum nanoparticles in the brain causing inflammation and causing all these diseases. I have seen increased anomalies levels in children with __ASD__, with children with, in children with not only __ASD__, but also attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
(1:38:07) They also have high levels of inlays, and this is not published, but I have seen in their laboratory results. So I hope that this information is helpful to you because it&#39;s an amazing, it&#39;s a devastating pain when the parents lose a child because of suicide. Yeah. And they are jumping from the apartments in big cities. They are hanging themselves in small cities. And this is happening in Brazil, and I think it&#39;s happening everywhere too.
(1:38:50) I have seen that it&#39;s happening in other countries. So you imagine the pain that is, this procedure is using aluminum nanoparticles in vaccines are causing. Okay. Very important message to get out. What? It&#39;s a very important message to get out. Thank you. Something needs to change. Yeah. Because it&#39;s difficult to deal with those mothers that have a child for those reasons. It&#39;s difficult to deal with the mother that brings her 16 year old adolescent child and says, doctor, he depends on me to use the toilet. What will happen to my child when I die? going to take, who is going to take care as I take care now of this child. It&#39;s a lot of suffering. And so that&#39;s why I decided that I had to tell you this. It&#39;s important that this is invest properly investigated. Yeah, my, my boys are 17 and 16 and they&#39;re still in high school.
(1:40:22) My, my two boys are 16 and 17 in high school. And it&#39;s a big problem, the depression and the, the suicide. It&#39;s a major problem everywhere. So I think a lot of people will be thankful to hear this information and I hope that, that there can be some serious action taken from it.
