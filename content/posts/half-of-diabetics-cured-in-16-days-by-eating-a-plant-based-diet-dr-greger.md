Comments to congress include

* “ **We do not have a protein-deficiency problem in the United States; we have a vegetable-deficiency problem.** ”

* "... the cancer risk of secondhand smoke is comparable to the 16% or 18% increased risk of colorectal cancer eating the equivalent of a single sausage link a day.”

* ...at least back since 2007, when the first comprehensive analysis was published by the American Institute for Cancer Research. In fact, one of their top ten recommendations for cancer prevention: Avoid Processed Meat."

* "The Global Burden of Disease Study, the largest study of disease risk factors in history—funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—found that the #1 cause of death in these United States is the American diet."

"After this hearing, the USDA and Department of Health and Human Services announced they are limiting the scope of information that can be used to determine the new guidelines.  **This decision leaves out the health impacts of ultraprocessed foods, sodium, and meat.** "

"...over half of the calories consumed by Americans come from ultraprocessed foods "
