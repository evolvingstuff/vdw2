 **Every symptom listed is, indeed, a sign of low Vitamin D  
However, there are many other possible causes for each symptom.  
The more symptoms you have, the more likely you have Vitamin D Deficiency  
If the symptom are due due to low vitamin D taking enough vitamin D will reduce them.  
Taking 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily will reduce most symptoms in 2-5 months
