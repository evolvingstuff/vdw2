| 987,849 | patients at University of Florida Hospital |
| 32,000 | tested for low vitamin D sometime since Oct 2015 |
| 887 | Tested positive for COVID-19 in 2020 |
| 87 | both tested positive and had low Vitamin D |

 **Note: Probably only a small fraction of those with low vitamin D actually were tested  
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Medicare, for example, will pay for only a single vitamin D test in a lifetime** 

 **Note: Some of the tests will have been done in the Spring, Summer, Fall  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; and the person could test OK during that season, but not in the winter** 

 **Note: Testing low probably was <20 ng/ml.    
 &nbsp; &nbsp; COVID-19 appears to be only fought by Vitamin D when > 30 or 40 ng**
