# [BLOG is here](http://www.gwern.net/Zeo#vitamin-d)

Used a $150 [ZEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeo,_Inc.) which monitors brain wave activity 

A lower cost unit uses a Smartphone

He looked at many different sleep parameters

The vitamin D analysis is about 2/3 the way thru the very long web page

At night had 5,000 IU vitamin D or placebo pills (one subject: double blind)

Takes 5,000 IU vitamin D the next morning if he discovered that the previous evening was a placebo

Extremely scientific, even includes the software code for the analysis on the web page
