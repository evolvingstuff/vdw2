&lt;p>The evidence from previous studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> and ovarian cancer risk are not conclusive. However, 25(OH)D was generally only measured in late adulthood, which may not capture the etiologically relevant exposure periods. We investigated predicted 25(OH)D over the adult lifetime in relation to ovarian cancer risk in a population-based case-control study conducted from 2011 to 2016 in Montreal, Canada (490 cases, 896 controls). Predicted 25(OH)D was computed using previously validated regression models. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for average predicted 25(OH)D over the adult life and risk. In addition, the relative importance of different periods of past 25(OH)D exposure was explored using a weighted cumulative exposure (WCE) model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gynecological cancers and atherosclerosis (perhaps a Vitamin D association)</title><link>/posts/gynecological-cancers-and-atherosclerosis-perhaps-a-vitamin-d-association.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/gynecological-cancers-and-atherosclerosis-perhaps-a-vitamin-d-association.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Pap tests (or Pap smears) look for abnormalities and precancers through microscopic examination of the cells in the cervix. An HPV test checks for the actual virus rather than for changes in the cervical cells. Although HPV is the leading cause of most CC, it does not necessarily indicate cancer. In fact, many women who test positive for an HPV infection will eventually clear the virus and not develop the disease, warranting unnecessary worry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ovarian Cancer risk reduced if higher vitamin D, more UVB, or better vitamin D receptor</title><link>/posts/ovarian-cancer-risk-reduced-if-higher-vitamin-d-more-uvb-or-better-vitamin-d-receptor.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ovarian-cancer-risk-reduced-if-higher-vitamin-d-more-uvb-or-better-vitamin-d-receptor.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ovarian Cancer – increased risk near pulp mills (air or water pollution)</title><link>/posts/ovarian-cancer-increased-risk-near-pulp-mills-air-or-water-pollution.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ovarian-cancer-increased-risk-near-pulp-mills-air-or-water-pollution.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="ovarian-cancer-incidence-in-the-us-and-toxic-emissions-from-pulp-and-paper-plants-a-geospatial-analysis">Ovarian Cancer Incidence in the U.S. and Toxic Emissions from Pulp and Paper Plants: A Geospatial Analysis&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Increasing attention is being devoted to the mechanisms by which cells receive signals and then translate these into decisions for growth, death, or migration. Recent findings have presented significant breakthroughs in developing a deeper understanding of the activation or repression of target genes and proteins in response to various stimuli and of how they are assembled during signal transduction in cancer cells. Detailed mechanistic insights have unveiled new maps of linear and integrated signal transduction cascades, but the multifaceted nature of the pathways remains unclear. Although new layers of information are being added regarding mechanisms underlying ovarian cancer and how polymorphisms in VDR gene influence its development, the findings of this research must be sequentially collected and re-interpreted. We divide this multi-component review into different segments: how vitamin D modulates molecular network in ovarian cancer cells, how ovarian cancer is controlled by tumor suppressors and oncogenic miRNAs and finally how vitamin D signaling regulates miRNA expression. Intra/inter-population variability is insufficiently studied and a better understanding of genetics of population will be helpful in getting a step closer to personalized medicine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ovarian Cancer 5.8 X more likely if both low vitamin D and Fok1 gene change</title><link>/posts/ovarian-cancer-58-x-more-likely-if-both-low-vitamin-d-and-fok1-gene-change.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ovarian-cancer-58-x-more-likely-if-both-low-vitamin-d-and-fok1-gene-change.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="vitamin-d-and-vdr-gene-polymorphism-foki-in-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-in-indian-population">Vitamin D and VDR gene polymorphism (FokI) in epithelial ovarian cancer in Indian population.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The aim of this study was to examine vitamin 25(OH)D3 concentration in ovarian cancer patients in relation to a pathological subtype of the tumor, FIGO stage, grading, menopause status and overall 5-year survival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancers and Vitamin D Council</title><link>/posts/cancers-and-vitamin-d-council.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancers-and-vitamin-d-council.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ovarian Cancer is somewhat associated with a reduction in 20 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/ovarian-cancer-is-somewhat-associated-with-a-reduction-in-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ovarian-cancer-is-somewhat-associated-with-a-reduction-in-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="meta-analysis-circulating-vitamin-d-and-ovarian-cancer-risk">Meta-analysis: Circulating vitamin D and ovarian cancer risk.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize evidence from longitudinal studies on the association between circulating 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and the risk of ovarian cancer (OC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>METHODS: Relevant prospective cohort studies and nested case-control studies were identified by systematically searching Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases and by cross-referencing. The following data were extracted in a standardized manner from eligible studies: first author, publication year, country, study design, characteristics of the study population, duration of follow-up, OC incidence according to circulating vitamin D status and the respective relative risks, and covariates adjusted for in the analysis. Due to the heterogeneity of studies in categorizing circulating vitamin D levels, all results were recalculated for an increase of circulating 25(OH)D by 20ng/ml. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using meta-analysis methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Calcium and vitamin D appear to be among the few ways to prevent ovarian cancer – 2010</title><link>/posts/calcium-and-vitamin-d-appear-to-be-among-the-few-ways-to-prevent-ovarian-cancer-2010.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/calcium-and-vitamin-d-appear-to-be-among-the-few-ways-to-prevent-ovarian-cancer-2010.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="independent-and-joint-effects-of-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-calcium-on-ovarian-cancer-risk-a-prospective-nested-casecontrol-study---june-2010">Independent and joint effects of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium on ovarian cancer risk: A prospective nested case–control study - June 2010&lt;/h3>
