INTRODUCTION: Several pharmacological drugs have shown proof of concept for longevity in animal models. I aimed to identify and review those longevity drug candidates that are undergoing clinical trials.

AREAS COVERED: Recent (post-2017) longevity clinical trials were found in US and EU clinical trial registries. Longevity drug candidates are the antidiabetic drugs metformin and acarbose, and the immunosuppressant rapamycin. These medicinal drugs are tested on biochemical and clinical markers of aging. In addition,  **vitamin D supplementation is being investigated in two mega-trials (sample size> 5000) for its efficacy in reducing all-cause mortality** .

EXPERT OPINION: Anti-aging effects of longevity drug candidates suggest, but do not demonstrate that they prolong life. The two megatrials with vitamin D supplementation make it possible to detect differences in life expectancy between vitamin D and placebo. Therefore, a protocol similar to that for vitamin D could be used to demonstrate pro-longevity effects of metformin, acarbose, and rapamycin.
