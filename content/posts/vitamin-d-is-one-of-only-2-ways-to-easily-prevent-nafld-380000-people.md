Background & Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver injury. We performed this umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize the evidence on the associations of nutritional, lifestyle, and metabolic factors with NAFLD. 

Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception until July 2, 2020, to identify meta-analyses of observational studies which explored the associations of nutritional, lifestyle, and metabolic factors with NAFLD. Evidence levels were assessed using summary effect sizes, 95% prediction intervals, between-study heterogeneity, evidence of small-study effects, and evidence of excess significance bias for each meta-analysis. (No. of PROSPERO, CRD42020200124). 

Results: Twenty two risk or protective factors from 10 published meta-analyses were included and studied. Three risk factors (sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, serum fetuin-A, and waist circumference) with highly suggestive levels of evidence and three risk factors (soft drink consumption, former smoking, and body mass index) with suggestive levels of evidence were identified. 

 **Only two protective factors (physical activity and serum vitamin D level**  <span>[among adults in Western countries]</span>) with suggestive levels of evidence were identified. Furthermore, other six risk factors and two protective factors with weak levels of evidence were identified. 

Conclusions: We found varying levels of evidence of associations of nutritional, lifestyle, and metabolic factors and NAFLD. The results suggest that nutritional and lifestyle management should be considered as a major primary preventive strategy for NAFLD. Moreover, considering the low quality of included meta-analyses and limited area of research topics, future high-quality original studies and meta-analyses should be performed to study these associations.
