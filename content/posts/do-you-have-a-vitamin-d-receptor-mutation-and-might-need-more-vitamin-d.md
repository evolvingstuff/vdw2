 **Comment by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki** 

I took the $29 test in 2016 - the results were not very clear

I took the 23andMe test around 2014

I will buy the StrateGene analysis in 2018 to analyse the 23andMe test results

 **After looking at over 8,000 Vitamin D studies I am sure that** 

1. Different people need different amounts of vitamin D to get to the same blood level

> The range is about 4 to 1

1. Some people need higher blood levels to get the benefits of vitamin D

> Due to 6 [genes](/categories/genetics) as well as [30 other reasons](/posts/reasons-for-low-response-to-vitamin-d)

1. The best plan appears to be to raise the vitamin D dosing level to as to provide the desired benefit

> My own vitamin D blood tests range around 100 ng for the past 7 years

> Just to hedge my bets. I also do 6 of the 7 things(see table below) to improve my Vitamin D receptor and thus increase Vitamin D to my cells
