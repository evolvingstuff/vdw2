The objective of this systematic review was to critically examine double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of non-herbal dietary supplements and vitamins (NHDS) for evidence that prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were reduced in PC patients. Five databases were searched from their inception through December 2012 to identify studies that met our inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane tool. Eight RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were of high methodological quality. The following supplements were tested: isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), minerals (Se) or vitamins (vitamin D) or a combination of antioxidants, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, lycopenes, minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg), phytoestrogens, phytosterols, vitamins (B2, B6, B9, B12, C, and E), and other substances (CoQ10 and n-acetyl-l cysteine). Five RCTs reported no significant effects compared with placebo. Two RCTs reported that a combination of antioxidants, isoflavones, lycopenes, minerals, plant oestrogens and vitamins significantly decreased PSA levels compared with placebo. One RCT did not report differences in PSA levels between the groups. In conclusion, the hypothesis that dietary supplements are effective treatments for PC patients is not supported by sound clinical evidence. There are promising data for only two specific remedies, which contained a mixture of ingredients, but even for these supplements, additional high quality evidence is necessary before firm recommendations would be justified.</p><hr><h3 id=using-genetic-proxies-for-lifecourse-sun-exposure-to-assess-the-causal-relationship-of-sun-exposure-with-circulating-vitamin-d-and-prostate-cancer-risk---april-2013>Using genetic proxies for lifecourse sun exposure to assess the causal relationship of sun exposure with circulating vitamin d and prostate cancer risk. - April 2013</h3><p>See VitaminDWiki page <a href=/posts/people-more-likely-to-freckle-are-more-likely-to-get-prostate-cancer-low-vitamin-d>People more likely to freckle are more likely to get prostate cancer (low vitamin D) – April 2013</a></p><p>which has the PDF</p><hr><h3 id=genetic-variation-in-the-vitamin-d-pathway-in-relation-to-risk-of-prostate-cancer--results-from-the-breast-and-prostate-cancer-cohort-consortium---april-2013>Genetic variation in the vitamin d pathway in relation to risk of prostate cancer&ndash;results from the breast and prostate cancer cohort consortium. - April 2013</h3><p>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2013 Apr;22(4):688-96. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0007-T.>doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0007-T.</a> Epub 2013 Feb 1.</p><p>Mondul AM, Shui IM, Yu K, Travis RC, Stevens VL, Campa D, Schumacher FR, Ziegler RG, Bueno-de-Mesquita HB, Berndt S, Crawford ED, Gapstur SM, Gaziano JM, Giovannucci E, Haiman CA, Henderson BE, Hunter DJ, Johansson M, Key TJ, Le Marchand L, Lindström S, McCullough ML, Navarro C, Overvad K, Palli D, Purdue M, Stampfer MJ, Weinstein SJ, Willett WC, Yeager M, Chanock SJ, Trichopoulos D, Kolonel LN, Kraft P, Albanes D.</p><p>National Cancer Institute, NIH, 6120 Executive Blvd, Suite 320, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. <a href=mailto:mondulam@mail.nih.gov>mondulam@mail.nih.gov</a></p><p>BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that vitamin D status may be associated with prostate cancer risk although the direction and strength of this association differs between experimental and observational studies. Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> status. We examined prostate cancer risk in relation to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in four genes shown to predict circulating levels of 25(OH)D.</p><p>METHODS: SNP markers localized to each of four genes (GC, CYP24A1, CYP2R1, and DHCR7) previously associated with 25(OH)D were genotyped in 10,018 cases and 11,052 controls from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. Logistic regression was used to estimate the individual and cumulative association between genetic variants and risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer.</p><p>RESULTS: We observed a decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer among men with the allele in rs6013897 near CYP24A1 associated with lower serum 25(OH)D <span>[per A allele]</span>, OR, 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.80-0.93; Ptrend = 0.0002) but an increased risk for nonaggressive disease (per A allele: OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17; Ptrend = 0.002). Examination of a polygenic score of the four SNPs revealed statistically significantly lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer among men with a greater number of low vitamin D alleles (OR for 6-8 vs. 0-1 alleles, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-0.98; Ptrend = 0.003).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>In this large, pooled analysis, genetic variants related to lower 25(OH)D levels were associated with a decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer.</p><p>IMPACT: Our genetic findings do not support a protective association between loci known to influence vitamin D levels and prostate cancer risk.</p><hr><h3 id=vitamin-d-levels-in-subjects-with-prostate-cancer-compared-to-age-matched-controls-2012>Vitamin d levels in subjects with prostate cancer compared to age-matched controls. 2012</h3><p>Prostate Cancer. 2012;2012:524206. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/524206>doi: 10.1155/2012/524206</a></p><p>Yaturu S, Zdunek S, Youngberg B.</p><p>Department of Endocrinology, Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, NY 12208, USA.</p><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the United States. Vitamin D is considered to have anticancer properties, currently thought to work mainly through its nuclear receptor or vitamin D receptor. In this retrospective study, we compared vitamin D levels in subjects with PCa with those of age-matched men without PCa. Study subjects included 479 in each group with a mean age of 73 and a mean creatinine of 1.05 and 1.15. Levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D were 28.4 ± 0.54 and 28.05 ± 0.62 in subjects with and without PCa. Levels of 1,25 (OH) vitamin D were 47.2 ± 6.8 and 47.1 ± 7.11 in subjects with and without PCa. In contrast to other studies, we did not find a significant difference in vitamin D levels. Among prostate cancer patients, vitamin D levels correlated positively with age (r = 0.12, P &lt; 0.02), and were negatively associated with BMI (r = -0.13, P = 0.003), glucose (r = -0.12, P &lt; 0.007), HbA1C (r = -0.16, P = 0.001), and PTH (r = -0.21; P &lt; 0.0001). The data do not show the causal effect of vitamin D levels on PCa.</p><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530178/%20><strong><span style=color:red>Full text on-line</span></strong></a></p><hr><h3 id=getting-sun-frequently-reduces-colon-breast-and-prostate-cancer---and-nhl---april-2013>Getting sun frequently reduces colon, breast, and prostate cancer - and NHL - April 2013</h3><p><strong>Is prevention of cancer by sun exposure more than just the effect of vitamin D?

We reviewed all published case-control and cohort studies concerning colorectal-, prostate-, breast cancer, <strong>non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma (NHL)</strong> and both sunlight and vitamin D to update our previous review and to verify if the epidemiological evidence is in line with the hypothesis that the possible preventive effect of sunlight on cancer might be mediated not only by vitamin D but also by other pathways. We found that almost all epidemiological studies suggest that <strong>chronic (not intermittent)</strong> sun exposure is associated with a reduced risk of <strong>colorectal-, breast-, prostate cancer and NHL</strong> . In colorectal- and to a lesser degree in breast cancer vitamin D levels were found to be inversely associated with cancer risk. In prostate cancer and NHL, however, no associations were found. These findings are discussed and it is concluded that the evidence that sunlight is a protective factor for colorectal-, prostate-, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma is still accumulating. The same conclusion can be drawn concerning high vitamin D levels and the risk of colorectal cancer and possibly breast cancer. Particularly in prostate cancer and NHL other sunlight potentiated and vitamin D independent pathways, such as modulation of the immune system and the circadian rhythm, and the degradation of folic acid might play a role in reduced cancer risk as well.</p><p><strong>1st page of letter to editor on this article by Dr. Grant is in the thumbnail</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/sun-exposure---grant-letter-to-editor.jpg alt=image><hr><h3 id=vitamin-d3-supplementation-low-risk-prostate-cancer-and-health-disparities-dec-2012>Vitamin D(3) supplementation, low-risk prostate cancer, and health disparities.

Since low-risk prostate cancers are monitored over time in an effort to determine which progress into clinically important, more aggressive cancers, they provide an excellent model in which to study, over an extended period of time, the effects of enhancing vitamin D status and related changes in tumor progression. This is particularly relevant to African-American men, who exhibit a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as well as higher incidence of prostate cancer and higher mortality rates from prostate cancer than Caucasians. Our research team has recently completed an open-label clinical trial aimed at assessing the safety and potential efficacy of vitamin D(3) supplementation at 4000 international units (IU) per day for one year in subjects diagnosed with early stage, low-risk prostate cancer. The results of this clinical study suggest that supplementation with vitamin D(3) at 4000IU per day may benefit patients with early stage, low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance, because of the improved outcome (a decreased number of positive cores at repeat biopsy) in more than half of the subjects enrolled in the trial. We also observed that, after one year of supplementation, there was no difference in circulating levels of vitamin D between African-American and Caucasian subjects who completed the study. These clinical results also suggest that robust and sustained vitamin D(3) supplementation can reduce prostate cancer-related health disparities in African-American men and that these health disparities are at least in part the result of widespread hypovitaminosis D within the African-American population.

Ecological studies based on geographical variations of cancer rates with respect to solar UVB doses have supported the hypothesis for about 20 cancers. This paper reviews the evidence from studies of personal or group UVB irradiance. Studies have associated personal UVB irradiance with reduced risk for breast, colon, endometrial, prostate, and renal cancer, as well as non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma (NHL). However, some studies have also found increased risk of NHL from UV irradiance, probably due to immunosuppression by UVA near 370 nm. Several related approaches have also been used to study the hypothesis. Studies in Norway and the UK found that diagnosis in summer or fall is associated with increased survival rates for breast, colon, lung, and prostate cancer, as well as Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. Diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin cancer is associated with reduced risk of several cancers in sunny countries, but not often in highlatitude countries. Living at higher surface elevation is associated with reduced risk of some cancers. In a recent analyzed study of cancer rates for 54 occupations in Nordic countries, a UVB index based on standardized incidence ratios of lip cancer less those for lung cancer was inversely correlated with 15 types of cancer for males, but only four types for females. This ecological study provides additional evidence that UVB doses at high latitudes are adequate to reduce the risk of cancer, but requires considerable time outside to produce sufficient vitamin D. Because only vitamin D production has been proposed to explain the UVB-cancer link, studies reviewed in this paper should be considered strong evidence for the hypothesis.</p><hr><h3 id=vitamin-d-sunlight-and-the-epidemiology-of-prostate-cancer---jan-2013>Vitamin d, sunlight, and the epidemiology of prostate cancer. - Jan 2013</h3><p>Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2013 Jan 1;13(1):45-57.</p><p>Schwartz GG.</p><p>Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. <a href=mailto:gschwart@wakehealth.edu>gschwart@wakehealth.edu</a>.</p><p>The hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of clinical prostate cancer has stimulated an extensive body of research. Ecologic studies have shown that mortality rates from prostate cancer are inversely correlated with levels of ultraviolet radiation, the principal source of vitamin D. Human prostate cells express receptors for 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D which exerts pleitropic anticancer effects on these cells in vitro and in animal models. Moreover, normal prostate cells synthesize 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D from circulating levels of 25-OHD, whose levels are dependent on exposure to ultraviolet light. Analytic epidemiologic studies of vitamin D and prostate cancer have focused on polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR), on serum vitamin D levels, and on solar exposure. A role for VDR polymorphisms in prostate cancer risk and progression is established. Prospective studies of serum 25(OH)D do not support a protective role for higher levels of 25(OH)D on prostate cancer risk overall, but a role for vitamin D deficiency is supported by several studies. Conversely, a growing body of evidence implicates low levels of 25-OHD with an increased risk of fatal prostate cancer. The results of most epidemiologic studies of sunlight exposure are consistent with a protective effect of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The discrepancy between the results of studies of solar exposure and studies of serum 25-OHD may be related to methodological differences and to uncertainties regarding the critical period for vitamin D exposure. Additionally, both high dietary intake of calcium and high levels of calcium in serum are positively associated with prostate cancer risk. The relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of prostate cancer may differ by calcium intake.</p><p><a href=http://www.eurekaselect.com/105337/article><strong><span style=color:red>Full text on-line</span></strong></a></p><hr><h3 id=prostate-cancer-vitamin-d-and-genes---march-2013>Prostate cancer, vitamin D and genes - March 2013</h3><p><strong>Associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and vitamin D pathway genes with prostate-specific antigen progression in men with localized prostate cancer undergoing active monitoring.</strong></p><p>Eur J Cancer Prev. 2013 Mar;22(2):121-5. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/CEJ.0b013e3283584954.>doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e3283584954.</a></p><p>Gilbert R, Metcalfe C, Fraser WD, Lewis S, Donovan J, Hamdy F, Neal DE, Lane JA, Martin RM, Tilling K.</p><p>School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 2PS, UK. <a href=mailto:becky.gilbert@bristol.ac.uk>becky.gilbert@bristol.ac.uk</a></p><p>Current diagnostic tests cannot differentiate the majority of prostate cancers with a low likelihood of progression from the minority with more aggressive potential.

We examined the associations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and vitamin D pathway polymorphisms with PSA doubling time in 490 men undergoing active monitoring for localized prostate cancer within a UK population-based cohort study <span>[mean follow-up 4.4 years (range: 0.3-7.6)]</span>. Repeat PSA measurements were analyzed using multilevel models. There was no evidence that circulating 25(OH)D levels, 1,25(OH)2D levels, or vitamin D pathway polymorphisms were associated with postdiagnosis PSA doubling time. Stratifying the results by prostate cancer grade at diagnosis (high grade or low grade) did not alter the results. We found no evidence that either circulating 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, or vitamin D pathway polymorphisms were associated with PSA doubling time in men undergoing active monitoring for localized prostate cancer.

The impact of sunshine on racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality is unknown.</p><p>METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database, the authors calculated age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates among black and white men aged ≥45 years by race and county between 2000 and 2009 (N = 906,381 men). Similarly, county-level prostate cancer mortality rates were calculated from the National Vital Statistics System (N = 288,874). These data were linked with the average monthly solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation index by county and data regarding health, wellness, and demographics. Multivariable regression analysis was used to assess whether increases in the UV index (in deciles) moderated the association between black race and the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer.</p><p>RESULTS: Compared with counties in the lowest UV index decile, prostate cancer incidence rates for white and black men were lower in counties with a higher UV index (all Ps ≤ .0.051). Incidence rates were higher for black men versus white men, but the difference by race was less for counties in the fourth to fifth UV index deciles versus those in the first decile (Ps ≤ 0.02). Mortality rates also were found to decrease with increasing UV index for white men (Ps ≤ 0.003), but increase for black men, and an unexplained increase in racial differences in mortality rates was observed with an increasing UV index.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in the incidence of prostate cancer were larger in some areas with less sunshine. Additional research should confirm the findings of the current study and assess whether optimizing vitamin D levels among black men can reduce disparities.</p><hr><h3 id=snp-of-vdbp-genes-associated-wih-prostate-cancer-risk-and-grade-but-not-stage---dec-2014>SNP of VDBP genes associated wih Prostate Cancer risk and grade, but not stage - Dec 2014</h3><p><strong>Associations of vitamin D pathway genes with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin-D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D, and prostate cancer: a nested case–control study</strong></p><p>Cancer Causes & Control</p><p>Rebecca Gilbert, Carolina Bonilla, Chris Metcalfe, Sarah Lewis, David M.

Patients affected with prostate cancer present with either a localized or advanced disease. In this review, we aim to provide a holistic overview of prostate cancer, including the diagnosis of the disease, mutations leading to the onset and progression of the disease, and treatment options. Prostate cancer diagnoses include a digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen analysis, and prostate biopsies. Mutations in certain genes are linked to the onset, progression, and metastasis of the cancer. Treatment for localized prostate cancer encompasses active surveillance, ablative radiotherapy, and radical prostatectomy. Men who relapse or present metastatic prostate cancer receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), salvage radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Currently, available treatment options are more effective when used as combination therapy; however, despite available treatment options, prostate cancer remains to be incurable. There has been ongoing research on finding and identifying other treatment approaches such as the use of traditional medicine, the application of nanotechnologies, and gene therapy to combat prostate cancer, drug resistance, as well as to reduce the adverse effects that come with current treatment options. In this article, we summarize the genes involved in prostate cancer, available treatment options, and current research on alternative treatment options.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;16&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/alternate-pc-treatments.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=phd-dissertation-on-vitamin-d-to-prevent-prostate-cancer---june-2023>PhD dissertation on Vitamin D to prevent Prostate Cancer - June 2023</h4><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;17&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/the-effects-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-on-prostate-cancer.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>__{FONT}</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>autoimmune</span>
