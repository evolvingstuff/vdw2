Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem. However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Asian populations is unclear. The aims of our study were to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with different health outcomes in Asia. Searches for studies published from January 2009 to January 2021 were performed in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021229841). 

In total, 472 studies with 746,564 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. The mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) concentration was 49.39 nmol/L; 20.93% of the participants had 25(OH)D levels <25 nmol/L, 22.82% had levels <30 nmol/L, 57.69% had levels <50 nmol/L, and  **76.85% had levels <75 nmol/L** . This review found that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Asia is high. 

The factors significantly related to vitamin D deficiency were gender, age, altitude, region, and  **specific diseases (diabetes, cancer, fracture, systemic lupus erythematosus <span>[SLE]</span>, fatty liver disease, osteopenia, thyroiditis, anemia, hepatitis, metabolic diseases, and dermatitis)** . These findings may serve as the foundation for more detailed public health strategies and policies on this issue.
