Magnesium (Mg) is an essential micronutrient that participates in various enzymatic reactions that regulate vital biological functions. The main aim was to assess the Mg status and its association with nutritional indicators in seventeen cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The serum Mg and calcium (Ca) levels were determined using standardized methods and the dietary Mg intake by prospective 72 h dietary surveys. 

The mean serum Ca (2.45 mmol/L) and Mg (0.82 mmol/L) had normal levels, and the mean dietary intake of the Ca (127% DRI: Dietary Reference Intake) and Mg (125% DRI) were high. 

No patients had an abnormal serum Ca. 

A total of 47% of the subjects had hypomagnesemia and 12% insufficient Mg consumption. One patient had a serum Mg deficiency and inadequate Mg intake. 

A total of 47 and 82% of our series had a high serum Ca/Mg ratio of >4.70 (mean 4.89) and a low Ca/Mg intake ratio of <1.70 (mean 1.10), respectively. 

The likelihood of a high Ca/Mg ratio was 49 times higher in patients with a serum Mg deficiency than in normal serum Mg patients. 

Both Ca/Mg ratios were associated with the risk of developing 

* cardiovascular disease (CVD), 

* type 2 diabetes (T2D), 

* metabolic syndrome (MetS), and even 

* several cancers. 

Therefore, 53% of the CF patients were at high risk of a Mg deficiency and developing other chronic diseases.
