##### 5 Diabetic Neuropathy interventions

Purpose: Neuropathy is one of the most important complications of diabetes. According to recent advances, vitamin D deficiency might play a role in the development and progression of diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, therapeutic vitamin D supplementation has the potential to improve this condition. The aim of the present review was to summarize new data available in this area.

Methods: The PubMed database was searched for articles written in English and published through September 2021, using combinations of the following key words: vitamin D, diabetes, diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, polyneuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, supplementation, and therapy.

Findings: A number of studies have suggested that vitamin D deficiency can play a significant role in the development of peripheral neuropathy, diabetic foot ulcers, as well as cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Vitamin D supplementation might serve as an effective adjuvant therapy for neuropathic pain and may slow or stop the progression of neural damage.

Implications: Vitamin D therapy for diabetic complications could be a reliable option; however, further studies are needed to confirm this notion.
