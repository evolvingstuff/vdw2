Walker Email author Jim Bartley Carlos A. Camargo Jr Edwin A. Mitchell</p><p>Purpose of Review: To examine the relationship between vitamin D and otitis media.</p><p>Recent Findings” Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with several respiratory diseases, including otitis media. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of otitis media. This relationship may be explained by vitamin D supporting the immune system by upregulating antimicrobial peptides which are effective against otopathogens and biofilm formation, supporting a less inflammatory immune response, or promoting beneficial commensal bacteria.</p><p>Summary” This review will explore risk factors of both otitis media and vitamin D deficiency, the evidence of vitamin D being beneficial for various forms of otitis media, and possible mechanisms of action.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Several studies have found that low concentrations of serum 25(OH)D are a risk factor for COME, AOM, and RAOM. However, studies to date do not indicate that low 25(OH)D concentration is a risk factor for CSOM. There has only been one RCT of vitamin D supplementation, which reported that it may be beneficial for AOM, but did not help reduce the risk of suppuration.</p><p>These findings place vitamin D as having a promising, but far from definitive, link with OM. In particular, more RCTs on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of thevarious forms of OM are needed, especially in at-risk children. Vitamin D supplementation alone is unlikely to present a “cure” for OM, but it could form part of a programme of treatment to improve the immune response against URI and pathogen overgrowth, in addition to existing interventions such as antibiotics, vaccines, and surgery.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/om-2019-t1.jpg alt=image width=900><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/otitis-media-review-july-2019.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-supplementation-reduces-the-risk-of-acute-otitis-media-in-otitis-prone-children---2013>Vitamin D Supplementation Reduces the Risk of Acute Otitis Media in Otitis-Prone Children - 2013</h4><p>Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 May 20.</p><p>Marchisio P, Consonni D, Baggi E, Zampiero A, Bianchini S, Terranova L, Tirelli S, Esposito S, Principi N.</p><ul><li><p>1 Pediatric Clinic 1, Dept of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Università degli Studi di Milano, Fondazione IRCCS Ca&rsquo; Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy;</p></li><li><p>2 Epidemiology Unit, Dept of Preventive Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Ca&rsquo; Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy;</p></li><li><p>3 Laboratory Medicine Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca&rsquo; Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.</p></li></ul><p>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a deficit in vitamin D (VD) is associated with an increased risk of recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM), and whether VD supplementation is effective in reducing the number of AOM episodes in otitis-prone children.</p><p>METHODS: A total of 116 children with a history of rAOM (≥3 episodes in preceding six months, or ≥4 episodes in preceding 12 months) were prospectively and blindly randomized to receive oral VD 1,000 IU/day or placebo for 4 months. Episodes of AOM were monitored for 6 months.</p><p>RESULTS: Fifty-eight children received placebo and 58 with similar characteristics were treated with VD. The number of children experiencing ≥1 AOM episode during the study period was significantly lower in the treatment group (26 vs 38; p=0.03). There was a marked difference in the number of children who developed uncomplicated AOM (p&lt;0.001), but no difference in the number of children with ≥1 episode of spontaneous otorrhea. The likelihood of AOM was significantly reduced in the patients whose serum VD concentrations were ≥30 ng/mL.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: VD hypovitaminosis is common in children with rAOM and associated with an increase in the occurrence of AOM when serum 25(OH)D levels are &lt;30 ng/mL. The administration of VD in a dosage of 1,000 IU/day restores serum values of ≥30 ng/mL in most cases and is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of uncomplicated AOM.</p><p><strong><a href=http://video.healio.com/video/vitamin-d-effective-in-reducing>8 minute video by one of the authors</a></strong></p><hr><p><strong>Summary 2013 study by VitaminDWiki</strong></p><ul><li><p>58 pairs of children who tended to get middle ear infection</p></li><li><p>26 got infection with vitamin D</p></li><li><p>38 got infection with placebo</p></li><li><p>Thus ~ 30% reduction in middle ear infection with 1,000 IU of vitamin D</p></li></ul><p><strong>Comment on 2013 study by VitaminDWiki: Even fewer ear infections if had</strong></p><ul><li><p>Started with a loading dose, thus eliminating about 3 months of ear infections.

The study group comprised children who were diagnosed with Otitis media with effusion between September 2016 and February 2017. Control group was conducted with children underwent circumcision or inguinal hernia repair operations that confirmed with ENT examination they do not have any sign of otitis media. After 3 months of follow-up without any treatment, unresolved cases who were accepted as chronic otitis media with effusion were operated under general anesthesia for ventilation tube application. Study and control groups were assessed depending on the serum 25(OH)Vitamin D levels at the end of 3 months; &lt; 15 ng/mL was accepted as vitamin D deficiency. The results were compared with the control group in terms of vitamin D levels. Also, subgroup analysis was performed addressing to the complete recovery otitis media with effusion and chronic otitis media with effusion.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>One-hundred-seventy-four children with otitis media with effusion and 80 control patients were included to the study. One-hundred-eight (62%) out of 174 patients with otitis media with effusion was completely recovered after a 3-months follow up. Of those 66 out of 174 children, they had persistent diseases, underwent ventilation tube insertion after a 3-months follow-up. The mean 25(OH)Vitamin D level was 18.98 ± 10.60 in otitis media with effusion group and 28.07 ± 14.10 in control group and the difference was statistically significant between the study and control group (p &lt; 0.001). Vitamin D deficiency was observed in 33 out of 66 patients (50.0%) in chronic otitis media with effusion group whilst 35 out of 108 patients (32.4%) in complete recovery otitis media with effusion group (p = 0.021). The rate of 25(OH)Vitamin D deficiency was 25% in control group which was statistically different from chronic otitis media with effusion and recovery chronic otitis media with effusion groups (p = 0.006).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>This study not only shows the relationship between Vitamin D and otitis media with effusion development, but also demonstrates the effects of Vitamin D on otitis media with effusion prognosis. There is a significant association between 25(OH)Vitamin D deficiency and follow-up outcomes of otitis media with effusion.</p><p>AIM:</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation and higher 25(OH)-vitamin D concentration are associated with reduced risk of acute respiratory infection. This study examined whether there is a similar association between higher serum 25(OH)D concentration and lower risk of chronic otitis media with effusion (COME).</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>In a case-control study, serum 25(OH)D concentration in children referred for tympanostomy tube placement for COME (n = 178) was compared to that of healthy children randomly sampled from primary care practices (n = 179). Subjects aged three and four years were recruited in Auckland, New Zealand between May 2011 and November 2013. Blood samples were collected from the children, and their guardians were interviewed. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>In a multivariable analysis, higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a lower risk of COME (OR: 0.86 per 10 nmol/L; 95% CI 0.77-0.97) after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation index, ethnicity, tobacco smoke exposure, duration of breastfeeding and season of blood sampling. Further adjustment for eight additional risk factors did not change the result.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>This finding supports further investigation into whether the risk of COME could be reduced by increasing serum 25(OH)D concentration through increased sun exposure, higher dietary intake or vitamin D supplementation.</p><hr><h4 id=international-consensus-on-otitis-media-with-effusion-does-not-contain-the-word-vitamin---feb-2018>International Consensus on otitis media with effusion does not contain the word VITAMIN - Feb 2018</h4><p><strong>International consensus (ICON) on management of otitis media with effusion in children</strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;.
