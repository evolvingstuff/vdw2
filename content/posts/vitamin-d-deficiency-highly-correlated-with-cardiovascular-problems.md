Vitamin D recently has been proposed to play an important role in a broad range of organ functions, including cardiovascular (CV) health; however, the CV evidence-base is limited. 

We prospectively analyzed a large electronic medical records database to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the relation of vitamin D levels to prevalent and incident CV risk factors and diseases, including mortality. 

The database contained 41,504 patient records with at least one measured vitamin D level. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (?30 ng/ml) was 63.6%, with only minor differences by gender or age. 

Vitamin D deficiency was associated with highly significant (p <0.0001) increases in the prevalence of  **diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease** . Also, those without risk factors but with severe deficiency had an increased likelihood of developing diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. 

The vitamin D levels were also highly associated with  **coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke (all p <0.0001)** , as well as with incident death, heart failure, coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction (all p <0.0001), stroke (p = 0.003), and their composite (p <0.0001). 

In conclusion, we have confirmed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the general healthcare population and an association between vitamin D levels and prevalent and incident CV risk factors and outcomes. These observations lend strong support to the hypothesis that vitamin D might play a primary role in CV risk factors and disease. Given the ease of vitamin D measurement and replacement, prospective studies of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat CV disease are urgently needed.
