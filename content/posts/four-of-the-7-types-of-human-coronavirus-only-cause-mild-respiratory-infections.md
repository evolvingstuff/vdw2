#### [There are seven strains of human coronaviruses:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus#Human_coronaviruses%20)  Wikipedia

 **Causes Respiratory infection** 

1) Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) 

2) Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) 

3) Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63, New Haven coronavirus) 

4) Human coronavirus HKU1

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: Rhinovirus makes 10% to 40% of ”common colds”

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Approximately 200 types of virus result in the “common cold”

 **Causes Serious infection** 

5) Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

6) Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV),

7) Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) = Wuhan coronavirus.

* “Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia, either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia and they can also cause bronchitis, either direct viral bronchitis or a secondary bacterial bronchitis”

 **Note: There are lots of Viruses** 

380 trillion viruses in each human (10**14)

million trillion trillion viruses on the planet (10**31)

 **Speculation that 2019-nCoV could become the 5th endemic coronavirus (Widespread, seasonal)** 

[Experts envision two scenarios if the new coronavirus isn’t contained](https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/04/two-scenarios-if-new-coronavirus-isnt-contained/) Feb 4 2020

* "OC43 and 229E are more prevalent than other endemic human coronaviruses, especially in children and the elderly. Together, the four are responsible for an estimated one-quarter of all colds"
