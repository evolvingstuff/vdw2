**Introduction:  
Endometrial tissue inside the uterus expands and then is shed during menstruation.  
 Sometimes the tissue attaches itself on the outside of the uterus or elsewhere in the body.   
It continues to cycle in size with each menstrual cycle.  
 Normally the autoimmune system destroys these attachments.   
There is some effort to call Endo an autoimmune disorder  
Note: High-Dose Vitamin D + Magnesium + Omega-3 is claimed to [treat 95% of all autoimmune disorders](/posts/video-by-dr-coimbra-95-percent-of-auto-immune-cured-with-vitamin-d-in-high-doses).**

#### Endometriosis reduced by periodic 50,000 IU of vitamin D - meta-analysis July 2024

 **The impact of vitamin D treatment on pregnancy rate among endometriosis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Annals of Medicine & Surgery 86(7):p 4098-4111, July 2024. | DOI: 10.1097/MS9.0000000000002174

Shrateh, Oadi N. MDa,*; Siam, Haneen A. MDa; Ashhab, Yasmeen S. MDa; Sweity, Raneen R. MDa; Naasan, Mashhour MDb

Background: 

Vitamin D supplementation is supposed to have an important role in the management of several endometriosis-related aspects, offering potential relief to affected individuals. Herein, the authors aim to evaluate the impact of vitamin D on pregnancy rates and clinical symptoms in women with endometriosis.

Methods: The authors extensively searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL from their inception to 20 July 2023.

Results: 

Three randomized controlled trials involving 167 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The findings demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation exhibits efficacy in alleviating dysmenorrhea associated with endometriosis, as evidenced by a meta-analysis showing a significant reduction in dysmenorrhea (mean difference −1.41, 95% CI −2.61 to −0.22, P = 0.02). However, the impact on dyspareunia was inconclusive, with a non-significant mean difference of –0.2 (95% CI −1.62 to 1.22, P = 0.78). In contrast, dyschezia significantly decreased with vitamin D supplementation (mean difference −1.10, 95% CI −2.22 to 0.02, P = 0.05 However, the meta-analysis did not show a significant effect of vitamin D on chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.

Conclusion: 

While antioxidant vitamin D supplementation demonstrates general effectiveness in alleviating endometriosis symptoms, such as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia, the existing literature lacks direct investigations into the specific impact of vitamin D on enhancing pregnancy rates among endometriosis patients. This observation prompts various hypotheses, suggesting that the positive effects of vitamin D supplementation on endometriosis-related symptoms may indirectly contribute to improved pregnancy outcomes and enhanced fertility.

#### Effects of vitamin D supplementation in endometriosis: a systematic review - Dec 2022

Reprod Biol Endocrinol . 2022 Dec 28;20(1):176. [doi: 10.1186/s12958-022-01051-9.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12958-022-01051-9.)

Dimitrios Rafail Kalaitzopoulos 1 2, Nicolas Samartzis 3, Angelos Daniilidis 4, Brigitte Leeners 5, Sofia Makieva 5, Konstantinos Nirgianakis 6, Ioannis Dedes 7, Julian Matthias Metzler 7, Patrick Imesch 7, Ioannis G Lempesis 8 9 10

Background: There is a growing body of human, animal and in vitro studies on vitamin D (vit D) substitution in endometriosis. The aim of this systematic review is to critically appraise and qualitatively synthesize the results of the available studies that examine the supplementation of vit D for endometriosis treatment.

Methods: A systematic search of the literature was conducted in four electronic databases (Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase) and grey literature for original research articles on humans, animals and in vitro models published in any language.

Results: Four human studies, four animal studies and four in vitro studies were included. Quantitative synthesis of human studies showed no significant effect of vit D intake for dysmenorrhea (2 studies, 44 vit D vs 44 placebo, mean -0.71, 95% CI -1.94, 0.51) and non-cyclic pelvic pain (2 studies, 42 vit D vs 38 placebo, mean 0.34, 95% CI -0.02, 0.71). Regarding reproductive outcomes in women with endometriosis after in vitro fertilization, the only available study showed no differences between women taking vit D and women taking placebo. Three of the four included animal studies showed regression of endometriotic implants when treated with vit D. The in vitro studies demonstrated that vit D decreases invasion and proliferation of endometriotic lesions without affecting apoptosis.

Conclusions: Although in vitro and animal studies suggest regression of the endometriotic implants and decrease of invasion and proliferation after vit D supplementation, this was not reflected in the results of the meta-analysis, which showed no benefit of vit D supplementation in patients with endometriosis and dysmenorrhea or non-cyclic pelvic pain as well as on the outcome of IVF treatment. However, given the heterogeneity and the diversity of the available studies, more research is required to shed light on the role of vit D supplementation in women with endometriosis.

* "It affects so many women — women who may not know they even have it; or who were told that their pain, which can be very severe, is normal; or those who struggle with infertility for years and may not know that this could be why; or women who have hysterectomies at a young age, because they’re in so much pain and don’t realize that it could be endometriosis."

* "we actually know that we lose about $78 billion a year out of the workforce because of the fact that this can, again, attack women in very different ways."

#### Endometriosis is associated with low vitamin D – 67 year literature review – Oct 2013

 **Vitamin D in endometriosis: A causative or confounding factor?** 

Metabolism, October 2013

a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon

b Department of Internal Medicine, Calcium Metabolism and Osteoporosis Program, WHO Collaborating Center for Metabolic Bone Disorders, Division of Endocrinology, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon

Objective: The aim of this paper is to review the evidence from studies that evaluated the relationship between vitamin D and endometriosis.

Design: Comprehensive review.

Materials and Methods” Systematic literature search in Medline for relevant publications from 1946 until June 2013.

Results: Endometriosis risk may be influenced by dietary vitamin D intake and plasma hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Vitamin D receptor and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes, 24-hydroxylase and 1-α hydroxylase, are found in the normal cycling endometrium and also in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. The endometrium is a target of 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D actions through regulation of specific genes and via immunomodulation. The endometrium in endometriosis expresses dysregulation of some vitamin D enzymes and receptors. If vitamin D and its metabolites are implicated in endometriosis-associated infertility, it is likely through interference with HOXA10 gene expression. The Gc2 phenotype of vitamin D binding protein is prevalent in women with endometriosis and may be implicated in its pathogenesis.  **In a mouse model, Elocalcitol, a VDR-agonist was shown to reduce the development of endometriotic lesions and recurrence.** 

Conclusion: A biological plausibility for a role of vitamin D, as an immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory agent, in the pathogenesis and treatment of endometriosis is suggested in this article, but is difficult to illustrate due to sparse evidence from human studies limited primarily to case–control studies. A significant knowledge gap precludes the establishment of a clear cause–effect relationship. The intriguing leads presented herein need to be investigated further with placebo-controlled supplementation trials.

#### Correlation found between the size of ovarian endometriomas and Vitamin D - Nov 2016

 **Ovarian endometriosis and vitamin D serum levels.** 

Gynecol Endocrinol. 2016 Nov 4:1-4. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Ciavattini A1, Serri M1, Delli Carpini G1, Morini S1, Clemente N1.

AIM:

The aim of this study was to assess the vitamin D serum level in women with ovarian endometriosis; specifically, a possible correlation between the dimensions of ovarian endometriomas and vitamin D serum levels was evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This was an observational study of childbearing-age women diagnosed with singleton ovarian endometrioma from January 2015 to December 2015. Women diagnosed with multiple ovarian endometriomas or extraovarian endometriosis were excluded.

RESULTS:

Forty-nine women constituted the initial study cohort. In these women, the mean (±SD) 25-OH-D3 serum level was 22.0 (±8.9) ng/ml, and 42 of them (85.7%) were diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D. In the "hypovitaminosis D women", the mean (± SD) diameter of ovarian endometriomas was 40.2 ± 22.6 mm, while in the "normal vitamin D serum level women" it was 26.7 ± 12.1 mm (p = 0.1). However, a significant linear correlation between 25-OH-D3 serum level and the diameter of ovarian endometriomas was found (r = -0.3, p = 0.03).

CONCLUSION:

We found a relatively high rate of women with ovrian endometriosis and hypovitaminosis D. Interestingly, a significant linear correlation between 25-OH-D3 serum levels and the diameter of ovarian endometrioma emerged.

#### Endometriosis in rats reduced by a huge dose of Omega-3 - Dec 2016

 **Efficacies of vitamin D and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on experimental endometriosis** 

Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Volume 55, Issue 6, December 2016, Pages 835–839, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tjog.2015.06.018

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 (vitamin D) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA) on experimentally induced endometriosis in a rat model.

Materials and Methods: A prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled experimental study was performed on 30 Wistar female rats. Endometriosis was surgically induced by implanting endometrial tissue on the abdominal peritoneum. Four weeks later, a second laparotomy was performed to assess pre-treatment implant volumes and cytokine levels. The rats were randomized into three groups: vitamin D group (42 μg/kg/day), omega-3 PUFA group  **(450 mg/kg/day)** , and control group (saline 0.1 mL/rat/day). These treatments were administered for 4 weeks. At the end of treatment, a third laparotomy was performed for the assessment of cytokine levels, implant volumes (post-treatment) and implants were totally excised for histopathologic examination. Pre- and post-treatment volumes, cytokine levels within the groups, as well as stromal and glandular tissues between the groups were compared.

Results: The mean post-treatment volume was statistically significantly reduced in the omega-3 PUFA group (p = 0.02) and the level of the interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the peritoneal fluid were significantly decreased at the end of treatment in the omega-3 PUFA group (p = 0.02, p = 0.03, and p = 0.03, respectively). In the vitamin D group, only IL-6 levels were significantly decreased. In the histopathologic examination, the glandular tissue and stromal tissue scores of the implants were significant lower in the omega-3 PUFA group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02).

Conclusion: Omega-3 PUFA caused significant regression of endometriotic implants. Vitamin D has not been as effective as omega-3 PUFA on endometriosis.

In a recent comprehensive review we suggest that endometriosis may be associated with a higher risk of several chronic diseases.

While the underlying mechanisms of endometriosis are not yet understood, the available data to date suggest that endometriosis may have important long-term health consequences, which – if confirmed in future well-conducted studies – will have important implications in the management and care of women with endometriosis.

 **Over recent decades, endometriosis has been associated with the risk of several chronic diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, asthma or allergic manifestations, and cardiovascular diseases.** 

Because the underlying mechanisms for these relations are not known, a deeper understanding is needed as it may lead to novel discoveries on the causes or consequences of endometriosis.

Our research group, led by Dr Stacey Missmer at Harvard University, examined the existing scientific literature to summarise the current evidence on chronic disease risk in women with endometriosis <sup>[1]</sup>.

We also explored the potential explanations for these associations and formulated methodological recommendations for future studies.

 **Endometriosis and the risk of cancer** 

While endometriosis has a benign nature, some evidence suggests a potential association between endometriosis and the risk of some cancers. The disease has even been suggested to share some characteristics with malignant tumours, such as invasion of local and distant organs, abnormal tissue growth, dysfunction of target organs, and genetic damage <sup>[2]</sup>.

This review suggests that women with endometriosis are generally at higher risk of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and skin melanoma, but that they are at decreased risk of cervical cancer.

 **NOTE:**  In reviewing available evidence both the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Guidelines <sup>[3]</sup> and the World Endometriosis Society Montpellier Consortium Consensus <sup>[4]</sup> do not call for routine screening of women with endometriosis for cancer.

All women should be vigilant of any changes in their bodies, and should seek medical help if they have suggestive symptoms.

 **Ovarian cancer**  The association with ovarian cancer was the most consistent across studies: out of the 21 studies reviewed, 20 reported an association <span>[5-24]</span>. The available data suggest that the relation is restricted to the endometrioid and clear-cell subtypes of ovarian cancer <sup>[20, 22]</sup> – rare types of ovarian cancer. It must be emphasised that the overall risk is low.

 **Breast cancer**  Among other gynaecological cancers, 14 studies were reviewed on endometriosis and breast cancer: while six of them reported a modest increase in breast cancer risk in women with endometriosis <sup>[7, 8, 15, 16, 25, 26]</sup>, four others reported no association <span>[24, 27-29]</span>, and four even reported a decreased breast cancer risk associated with endometriosis <sup>[10, 13, 30, 31]</sup>. Overall this is inconclusive, based on current evidence.

 **Endometrial and cervical cancer**  Results for endometrial cancer were conflicting; however, it is important to note the low numbers of cases in the eight studies reviewed <sup>[7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 24, 32]</sup>. Despite even lower numbers for cervical cancer, however, the four studies that evaluated this association all reported a decreased risk in women with endometriosis <sup>[7, 8, 15, 16]</sup>. It is possible that this is due to women with endometriosis being vigilant about regular examinations by their gynaecologist.

 **Melanoma skin cancer**  Among non-gynaecological cancers, melanoma skin cancer has been the most studied in relation to a history of endometriosis. Out of the 12 studies that explored this topic, seven suggested a positive association <span>[10, 13, 15, 16, 33-35]</span>, while five studies reported no clear relation between endometriosis and melanoma risk <span>[8, 28, 36-38]</span>, so the evidence is mostly inconclusive.

 **Other cancers**  Explorations of associations with other cancers have been sparse; consequently, no firm conclusions can be drawn to date as to the subsequent risk of other malignant tumours in women with endometriosis.

 **Endometriosis and autoimmune diseases** 

An autoimmune disease is a disorder that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and damages its own tissue. This type of condition may affect one or more organs or tissue types, and it has been shown to more frequently affect women than men <sup>[39]</sup>.

While endometriosis is not itself an autoimmune disease, our review found nine studies that suggest that women with endometriosis may be at higher risk of several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus <sup>[40, 41]</sup>, Sjögren’s syndrome <sup>[40, 41]</sup>, multiple sclerosis <sup>[40, 41]</sup>, rheumatoid arthritis <sup>[40]</sup>, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) <sup>[42]</sup>, and coeliac disease <sup>[43]</sup>.

 **Endometriosis and asthma and allergic manifestations** 

Based on the review of six studies on the topic <span>[40, 44-48]</span>, the available evidence suggests that women with endometriosis may be more susceptible to allergic manifestations (eg. eczema, hay fever, food sensitivities, allergies to medication) and to allergy-related conditions such as asthma.

 **Endometriosis and cardiovascular diseases**  Among the four studies that investigated a possible relation between endometriosis and cardiovascular diseases, two reported significantly lower flow-mediation dilation (ie. lower ability of the artery to dilate in response to a shear stress) in women with endometriosis as compared with controls <sup>[49, 50]</sup>, while another study found no evidence of a significant difference in carotid intima-media thickness (ie. the thickness of the innermost two layers of the carotid artery’s wall) <sup>[51]</sup>.

However, the only large-scale epidemiological study on the topic, conducted in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort, showed increased risks of myocardial infarction, angina, and surgical treatment of the coronary artery in women with endometriosis <sup>[52]</sup>.

 **Potential explanations for these associations** 

While the exact mechanisms underlying these associations are unknown, the co-occurrence of endometriosis and other disease outcomes may reflect at least four potential explanations:

1. Previous studies may have reported spurious associations due to methodological bias. First, the exploration of the subsequent risk of chronic diseases in women with endometriosis carries a number of methodological complexities, which, if not tackled appropriately, may lead to biased conclusions.

> For instance, the difficulty to characterise endometriosis and some chronic diseases (e.g. autoimmune diseases) accurately in large-scale population-based studies, or recall bias from women in studies relying on self-reported diagnosis, could lead to systematic errors in the definition of the disease status of study subjects, which in turn may alter the results in an unpredictable direction.

1. Endometriosis may induce physiological changes that increase the risk of some chronic diseases However, it is possible that some consequences of endometriosis (such as infertility, chronic inflammation, aberrant hormonal and immunologic responses, or lifestyle changes associated with disease diagnosis) influence the long-term risk of other diseases.

> For example, chronic inflammation in the pelvic cavity may influence a woman’s risk of ovarian cancer. However, deeper research is needed in order to investigate the physiological pathways that may link endometriosis consequences to chronic disease risk.

1. Endometriosis may share common risk factors with some chronic diseases. Another possibility is that endometriosis and the studied chronic diseases share common risk factors, whether they are already known or not. All or part of the observed associations could thus simply reflect a correlation of factors.

> In this case, this research may allow the discovery of novel risk factors for endometriosis and/or the studied chronic disease. For example, the investigation of an association between endometriosis and melanoma skin cancer helped to discover a novel risk profile for women with endometriosis, who were shown to be more likely to have moles <span>[36, 53-56]</span> and/or a sun-sensitive pigmentary profile (i.e. poor tanning ability <span>[54-56]</span>, red hair <sup>[34, 57, 58]</sup>, fair eyes <sup>[56, 59]</sup>, or freckling <sup>[55, 56]</sup>) than women without endometriosis.

1. Treatment for endometriosis could be associated with some chronic diseases. Finally, it is also possible that these associations reflect an underlying relation between treatment(s) for endometriosis and the risk of these chronic diseases.

> However, little of the research reviewed accounted for this possibility in the analyses.

 **Endometriosis and potential co-morbidities** 

In conclusion, the available data to date suggest that women with endometriosis may represent a high-risk group for a number of chronic diseases.

However, given the methodological complexities associated with this research and a general lack of detailed data on endometriosis in previous studies, further research is needed in order to increase our understanding of this disease, for which the causes are largely unknown to date.

If relationships between endometriosis and chronic diseases are confirmed, these findings will have important implications in the management and care of women with endometriosis.

Background

Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 5–10% and grave consequences for quality of life and fertility. Vitamin D (vit D), a classic regulator of plasma calcium concentration and skeleton mineralization, is also an effective modulator of the immune system. Several studies suggest that immunologic properties attributed to vit D along with vit D receptor (VDR) expression in reproductive tissues may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.

Objective: To systematically review the literature for the association between components of vit D metabolism and endometriosis.

Materials and methods

A systematic review of the literature published in the Medline and Cochrane Central databases was conducted for original research articles on humans, published in any language.

Results

Twenty-one studies were included in the systematic review. Among them, 

* 12 examined the relationship of endometriosis with vit D metabolites, 

*  **eight with vit D–binding protein (VDBP)** , 

* three with VDR polymorphisms, and 

* two with vit D regulatory enzymes. 

There are discrepancies between the outcomes of the available literature publications.

Conclusions

This is a systematic attempt to collect, evaluate, and present the known data on the association between vit D and endometriosis. Given the heterogeneity and the diversity of the present studies, more research is required to elucidate the association between vit D and endometriosis.
