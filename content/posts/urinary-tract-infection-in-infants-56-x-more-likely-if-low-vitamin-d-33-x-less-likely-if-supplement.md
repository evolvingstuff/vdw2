#### Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and risk of urinary tract infection in infants- 2016

Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Jul;95(27):e4137. [doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000004137.](https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000004137.)

The aim of the study is to determine whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency in infants increased odds of urinary tract infection (UTI). A total of 238 infants including 132 patients experiencing a first episode of UTI and 106 controls, aged from 1 to 12 months, were enrolled. Serum 25(OH)D levels were tested through blood sampling. The serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in cases with UTI than controls. The mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 29.09 ± 9.56 ng/mL in UTIs and 38.59 ± 12.41 ng/mL in controls (P < 0.001). Infants with acute pyelonephritis (APN) had lower serum 25(OH)D than those with lower UTI. The multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL ( **OR 5.619,**  95% CI 1.469-21.484, P = 0.012) was positively related to an increased odds of UTI. Vitamin D supplementation (OR 0.298, 95% CI 0.150-0.591; P = 0.001) was associated with a decreased likelihood of UTI. Vitamin D deficiency in infants was associated with an increased odds of UTI. Interventional studies evaluating the role of vitamin D supplementation to reduce the burden of UTI are warranted.

#### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with urinary tract infection in children - 2018

 **1.9 X higher risk if Vitamin D < 10 ng**

INTRODUCTION:

In humans, vitamin D has been shown to play a role in infectious diseases, but its association with acquisition and a complicated course of febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) has not been investigated. We aimed to investigate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) levels and the risk of first time febrile UTI in children.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:

This prospective case-control study included 50 children with first febrile UTI, with no risk factors for UTI, and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy siblings as controls. White blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and parathormone were measured in all studied children. Vitamin D status was determined by measuring plasma 25(OH)D3 level. Deficiency was defined as a plasma 25(OH)D3 level ≤ 25 nmol/l.

RESULTS:

Children with UTI had significantly lower mean serum levels of 25(OH)D3 (10.5 ±2.7 nmol/l) than those of controls (25.9 ±5.6 nmol/l) (p < 0.05). Patients with lower UTI had significantly higher serum levels of 25(OH)D3 compared to those with acute pyelonephritis (12.4 ±2.59 vs. 8.2 ±3.2 nmol/l; p < 0.001). Mean serum levels of 25(OH)D3 were significantly lower (p = 0.001) in the female patients compared with males, and this difference was not found within the control group. Multivariate analysis showed that a serum 25(OH)D3 level of ≤ 25 nmol/l is associated with UTI (OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.61-2.82; p = 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency (≤ 25 nmol/l) was an independent risk factor for UTI in children.
