Chronic pruritus is a distressing condition that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Recent research has increasingly focused on the potential role of vitamin D, given its immunomodulatory properties, in managing this condition. This meta-analysis seeks to systematically assess the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in alleviating chronic pruritus across diverse clinical contexts. We conducted an extensive search through multiple databases, covering literature up to July 2024, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of vitamin D on chronic pruritus. Eligible studies were those that provided data on changes in pruritus severity, as measured by standardized tools, before and after vitamin D treatment. The data were synthesized using a random-effects model to address variability among the studies. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024579353). The findings indicate that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a significant reduction in pruritus severity, the skin lesion area, and levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), compared to controls. These results suggest that vitamin D could be a promising therapeutic option for chronic pruritus, though further rigorous studies are required to validate these findings and to elucidate the mechanisms involved.
