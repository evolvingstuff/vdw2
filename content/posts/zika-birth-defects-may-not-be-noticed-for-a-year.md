#### [Zika Virus Damage Can Mislead Parents, Experts Say](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/zika-virus-outbreak/zika-virus-damage-can-mislead-parents-experts-say-n654181) NBC News

* Examples of wrong  behavior: Crawling at 2 months, tiny infant sits straight up when her foot is tickled

* “The reflexes making these young infants seem so developmentally accelerated come from the brain stem, and they are supposed to stop a few weeks after birth.”

* “What's becoming clear is that Zika's hallmark birth defect — microcephaly — is only the most obvious symptom. As babies damaged by Zika infection get to four months, six months, a year old, more problems are showing up”

* “Many also have terrible, painful reflux — caused when food and stomach acid bubble up into the esophagus. It's being caused because the infants are not suckling properly, using the reflex instead of coordinated sucking, she said.”

* “In addition, some babies born looking normal have regressed, Van der Linden said. "At birth, they were normal. Head circumference was normal. But now they have microcephaly," she said.”
