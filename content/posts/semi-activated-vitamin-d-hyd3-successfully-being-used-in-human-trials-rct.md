#### A 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol-Fortified Dairy Drink Is More Effective at Raising a Marker of Postprandial Vitamin D Status than Cholecalciferol in Men with Suboptimal Vitamin D Status.

* Semi-activated vitamin D would be expected to get into the blood stream faster, as no liver processing is needed

* HyD3 has long been used on farms

* This is the first instance I can recall of it being used for humans

* Should do great – especially for those with poor livers

* Probably low cost

* [Is HyD (25(OH)D) a better form of vitamin D for some animals and maybe humans with liver problems](/posts/is-hyd-25ohd-a-better-form-of-vitamin-d-for-some-animals-and-maybe-humans-with-liver-problems)

Background: One strategy for improving population vitamin D status is consumption of fortified foods. However, the effects of dairy products fortified with different vitamin D isoforms on postprandial vitamin D status and metabolic outcomes have not been addressed.

Objective: We investigated whether consumption of dairy drinks fortified with either 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <span>[25(OH)D3]</span> or cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) had differential effects on 24-h circulating plasma 25(OH)D3 concentration (a marker of vitamin D status) and cardiometabolic risk markers.

Methods: A randomized, controlled, 3-way crossover, double-blind, postprandial study was conducted in 17 men with suboptimal vitamin D status [mean ± SEM age: 49 ± 3 y; body mass index (in kg/m2): 26.4 ± 0.6; and plasma 25(OH)D3 concentration: 31.7 ± 3.4 nmol/L](mean%20±%20SEM%20age:%2049%20±%203%20y;%20body%20mass%20index%20(in%20kg/m2):%2026.4%20±%200.6;%20and%20plasma%2025(OH)D3%20concentration:%2031.7%20±%203.4%20nmol/L). They were randomly assigned to consume 3 different test meals (4.54 MJ, 51 g fat, 125 g carbohydrate, and 23 g protein), which contained either a nonfortified dairy drink (control), 20 μg 25(OH)D3-fortified (+HyD3) dairy drink, or 20 μg vitamin D3-fortified (+D3) dairy drink with toasted bread and jam on different occasions, separated by a 2-wk washout. Plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations and cardiometabolic risk markers, including vascular stiffness, serum lipids, and inflammatory markers, were measured frequently within 8 h postprandially and 24 h after the dairy drink was consumed.

Results: Plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations (the primary outcome) were significantly higher after the +HyD3 dairy drink was consumed compared with +D3 and control (P = 0.019), which was reflected in the 1.5-fold and 1.8-fold greater incremental area under the curve for the 0-8 h response, respectively. The change in plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations from baseline to 24 h for the +HyD3 dairy drink was also 0.9-fold higher than the +D3 dairy drink and 4.4-fold higher than the control (P < 0.0001), which were not significantly different from each other.

Conclusion: The dairy drink fortified with 25(OH)D3 was more effective at raising plasma 25(OH)D3 concentrations postprandially than was the dairy drink fortified with vitamin D3 in men with suboptimal vitamin D status. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02535910.
