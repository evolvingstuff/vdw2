Background: Vitamin D (25-0H D3) deficiency represents a rising problem in Western countries. Vitarnin D has been recently reported to regulate idammatory process, vascular cells proliferation and even platelet function, with contrasting results on its role on atherothrombosis.We, therefore, aimed to assess the relationship between 25-0H D3 and the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Methods: In 1484 patients fasting samples were collected for 25-0H D3 levels. Hypovitaminosis D was defined for values <30 ng/mL, (lower limit normal), and severe deficiency if <15ng/mL. CAD was considered as at least 1 vessel stenosis > 50,, while severe CAD for lett main and/or trivessel disease, as evaluated by Q..

Results: Hypovitaminosis D was observed in 91.8 % of patients.. 

Dividing our population according to vitamin D tertiles values (<9.6; >18.4), lower levels related with 

* aging, 

* female gender (p<0.001, respectively), 

* renal failure (p-0.05), 

* active smoking (p-0.001), 

* acute coronary syndrome at presentation (p<0.001), 

* therapy with calcium antagonists (p-0.02) and 

* diuretics (p<0.001), 

* less beta-blockers (p-0.02) and 

* stafins (p-0.001) use. 

Vitamin D 

* directly related with haemoglobin (p<0.001) and 

* inversely with platelet count (p-0.002), 

> total and LDL cholesterol (p-0.002 and p<0.001) and 

> triglycerides (p-0.01). 

Hypovitaminosis D was related with higher prevalence of left main and right coronary artery disease (p-0.03). 

Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher prevalence of CAD 1.32 and severe CAD 1.81. Moreover, an additional CAD risk was found in patients with severe rather than mild vitamin D deficiency (16 â€“ 30 ng/m1) OR 2.11 and adjusted. OR 1.7 compared with normal).

Conclusions: Hypovitaminosis D is observed in the vast majority of patients undergoing  **coronary angiography** .Vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with the extent of CAD, with higher risk for values < 15 ng/ml.
