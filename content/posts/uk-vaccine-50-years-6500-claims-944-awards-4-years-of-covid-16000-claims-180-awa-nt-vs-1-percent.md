#### Is the system letting down people who were harmed by Covid vaccines?

 **[BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d5d6nng67o?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** 

 **Note** 

Approximately 97% of approved claims relate to the AstraZeneca vaccine

More than 5,500 claims have been rejected, while many others remain under review

UK has increased administrative staff from 4 to 80 to handle the increased volume of claims

Many countries have a similar claim acceptance rate = about 1%
