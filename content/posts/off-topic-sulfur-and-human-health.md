#### Sulfur in human nutrition and applications in medicine.

Altern Med Rev. 2002 Feb;7(1):22-44.

Because the role of elemental sulfur in human nutrition has not been studied extensively, it is the purpose of this article to emphasize the importance of this element in humans and discuss the therapeutic applications of sulfur compounds in medicine. Sulfur is the sixth most abundant macromineral in breast milk and the third most abundant mineral based on percentage of total body weight. The sulfur-containing amino acids (SAAs) are 

* methionine, 

* cysteine, 

* cystine, 

* homocysteine, 

* homocystine, and 

* taurine. 

Dietary SAA analysis and protein supplementation may be indicated for vegan athletes, children, or patients with HIV, because of an increased risk for SAA deficiency in these groups. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), a volatile component in the sulfur cycle, is another source of sulfur found in the human diet. 

Increases in serum sulfate may explain some of the therapeutic effects of 

* MSM, 

* DMSO, and 

* glucosamine sulfate. 

Organic sulfur, as SAAs, can be used to increase synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine 

* (SAMe), 

* glutathione (GSH), 

* taurine, and 

* N-acetylcysteine (NAC). 

MSM may be effective for the treatment of allergy, pain syndromes, athletic injuries, and bladder disorders. 

Other sulfur compounds such as SAMe, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), taurine, glucosamine or chondroitin sulfate, and reduced glutathione may also have clinical applications in the treatment of a number of conditions such as 

* depression, 

* fibromyalgia, 

* arthritis, 

* interstitial cystitis, 

* athletic injuries, 

* congestive heart failure, 

* diabetes, 

* cancer, and 

* AIDS. 

Dosages, mechanisms of action, and rationales for use are discussed. 

The low toxicological profiles of these sulfur compounds, combined with promising therapeutic effects, warrant continued human clinical trails.

Interesting to note the medicinal benefits of hot sulfur springs have been recognized since before the Romans

Cures include skin conditions, asthma and arthritis.

> Mud baths containing sulfur, often called balneotherapy, can help treat skin disorders and arthritis. Balneotherapy is one of the oldest forms of pain relief for people with arthritis. 

> The term "balneo" comes from the Latin word for bath and means soaking in thermal or mineral waters. 

> Some people claim these baths are useful for allergies and respiratory problems, but there is no scientific evidence for these uses.

> Arthritis: Studies have used a dose by mouth of 500 - 3,000 mg MSM per day; or topical doses of a cream or gel with 25% DMSO applied 1 - 3 times per day

> Hayfever: One study used 2,600 mg per day. 

> Amyloidosis (rare): Case reports have used a dose by mouth of 7 - 15 g DMSO per day; or, topical doses of 50 - 100% DMSO applied 2 times per week.
