Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary artery disease and stroke, is the leading cause of mortality in the nation. 

Excess CVD morbidity and premature mortality in the  **African American**  community is one of the most striking examples of racial/ ethnic disparities in health outcomes. 

African Americans also suffer from increased rates of hypovitaminosis D, which has emerged as an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 

This overview examines the potential role of hypovitaminosis D as a contributor to racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

We review the epidemiology of vitamin D and CVD in African Americans and the emerging biological roles of vitamin D in key CVD signaling pathways that may contribute to the epidemiological findings and provide the foundation for future therapeutic strategies for reducing health disparities.
