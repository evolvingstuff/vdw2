Vitamin D dosage depends on the target concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) desired. A useful rule of thumb is that an incremental dose of 1 ?g/day (40 IU) of vitamin D3 raises 25(OH)D by 1 nmol/L after 8 months of use. (Equivalent to 100 IU/day increases 25(OH)D by 1 ng/mL.) If the same cumulative dose of vitamin D is given, there is no difference in efficacy between daily, weekly, or monthly dose intervals. Hypercalcemia is the classic criterion for toxicity of vitamin D, its metabolites and their analogs. “Non-calcemic” doses are considered “safe” by conventional criteria. Levels of 25(OH)D >75 nmol/L (>30 ng/mL) generally relate to lower risk of colorectal cancer, bone fractures, and desirable health outcomes. To ensure levels higher than this in adults requires vitamin D3 at an average total input from sunshine, diet and/or supplements of 75 ?g/day (3000 IU/day).
