Background

Inconsistencies exist with regard to the influence of omega-3 supplementation on 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, which could be attributed to many factors, such as the duration and dose of omega-3 supplementation, and individuals’ baseline 25(OH)D levels. Therefore, to address the inconsistencies, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to accurately determine the effect of omega-3 supplementation on 25(OH)D levels in humans.

Methods

We performed a comprehensive literature search in Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases from inception up to January 2020. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to assess the influence of omega-3 supplementation on serum 25(OH)D levels using the random-effects model.

Results

Our pooled results of 10 RCTs demonstrated an overall significant increase in 25(OH)D levels following omega-3 intake (WMD = 3.77 ng/ml, 95% CI: 1.29, 6.25). In addition, 25(OH)D levels were significantly increased when the intervention duration lasted >8 weeks and when the baseline serum 25(OH)D level was ˂20 ng/ml. Moreover, omega-3 intake ≤1000 mg/day resulted in higher 25(OH)D levels compared to omega-3 intake >1000 mg/day.

Conclusion

In conclusion, omega-3 supplementation increased 25(OH)D concentrations, particularly with dosages ≤1000 mg/day and intervention durations >8 weeks.

#### Magnesium also increases Vitamin D
