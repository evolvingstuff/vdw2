#### It appears that after <a href="/posts/much-study" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1242">much study</a> that the US Veterans Admin. has decided that Vitamin D does indeed help MS

##### The VA [Multiple Sclerosis Center of Excellence](http://www.va.gov/MS/video_multiple_sclerosis_and_vitamin_D.asp) has a video on the web July 2011

#### The 2.5 minute video is just people talking, but has the following graph

from an unknown study - perhaps in 2011

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/ms-and-vitamin-d-va---2011.png" alt="image">

The horizontal axis shows the amount of vitamin D in the blood BEFORE getting MS

The vertical access shows the relative risk of subsequently getting Multiple Sclerosis

Vitamin D < 66 nmol (25 ng) Risk =1

Vitamin D 66-74 nmol (25-30 ng) Risk = 0.57

Vitamin D 75-85 nmol (30-34 ng) Risk = 0.57

Vitamin D 84-99 nmol (34-40 ng Risk =0.74

 **Vitamin D 99-152 nmol (<span style="color:#F00;">40-61 ng</span>) Risk = 0.30**
