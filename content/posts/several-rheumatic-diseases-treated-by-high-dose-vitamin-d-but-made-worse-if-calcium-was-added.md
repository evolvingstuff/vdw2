#### Effects of vitamin D with or without calcium on pathological ossification: A retrospective clinical study

Vitamin D protects against the development and severity of several rheumatic diseases. However, the effect of vitamin D on the pathological ossification associated with rheumatic diseases remains unknown. The present retrospective study analyzed the clinical outcomes of vitamin D without calcium compared with vitamin D with calcium on pathological ossification in joints and ligaments. Data were collected from patients who were diagnosed with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or spondylarthritis, and the presence of pathological ossification in joints or ligaments was confirmed by X-ray, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examination. 

A total of 2,965 patients aged 18-75 years old were included, among who, 

* 1,725 were included in the vitamin D alone group and 

* 1,240 in the vitamin D with calcium group. 

Vitamin D was administered intramuscularly  **(300,000 IU) once every 7-10 days** , 4-6 times in total. Patients who ingested an oral calcium supplement (1,000 mg/day; =5 days/week) were considered the vitamin D with calcium group. The clinical outcome was evaluated based on the imaging changes of pathological ossification, which were classified as alleviation, aggravation and unchanged. The bone mineral density (BMD) was determined, and the calcium concentration in the serum and urine was measured. The results revealed that vitamin D alone alleviated pathological ossification, while vitamin D combined with calcium aggravated pathological ossification in the majority of patients (P<0.0001) independent of disease type and patient age. BMD measurements demonstrated a decreasing trend in the vitamin D alone group, whereas they exhibited an increasing trend in the vitamin D combined with calcium group. The urine calcium concentration increased after vitamin D treatment alone. Therefore, it was concluded that vitamin D exerted both pro-resorptive and anti-resorptive actions on pathological ossification. The bidirectional action of vitamin D on bone metabolism may depend on exogenous calcium supplementation.
