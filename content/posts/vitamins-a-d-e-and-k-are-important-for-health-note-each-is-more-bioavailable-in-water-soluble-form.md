#### Fat-Soluble Vitamins A, D, E, and K: Review of the Literature and Points of Interest for the Clinician

J Clin Med. 2024 Jun 21;13(13):3641. [doi: 10.3390/jcm13133641.](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13133641.)

Fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K, are energy-free molecules that are essential to the body's functioning and life. Their intake is almost exclusively exogenous, i.e., dietary. As a result, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are rarer in industrialized countries than in countries with limited resources. Certain groups of people are particularly affected, such as newborns or growing children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and elderly or isolated individuals. Deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, and K are also relatively frequent in subjects with digestive tract disorders, liver diseases, chronic pathologies, or in intensive care patients. Deficiencies or excesses of fat-soluble vitamins are responsible for a variety of more or less specific clinical pictures. Certain syndromes are typical of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, such as the combination of ophthalmological and immunity impairments in the case of vitamin A deficiency or hemorrhagic syndrome and osteopenia in the case of vitamin E deficiency. This is also the case for osteomalacia, muscular weakness, even falls, and rickets in the case of vitamin D deficiency. Diagnosis of a deficiency in one of the fat-soluble vitamins relies on blood tests, which are not always essential for routine use. In this context, a therapeutic test may be proposed. Treatment of deficiencies requires vitamin supplementation, a well-balanced diet, and treatment of the cause.

#### A D E K emulsions - Perplexity AI July 2024

Yes, all fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are available as emulsions. Emulsions are a common delivery method for these vitamins due to their poor water solubility and the need for improved bioavailability and stability.Here are some key points regarding the availability and use of emulsions for fat-soluble vitamins:

1.  **Vitamin A** : Vitamin A can be encapsulated in various types of emulsions, including nanoemulsions and microemulsions, to improve its stability and bioavailability. These emulsions help protect vitamin A from oxidation and enhance its absorption in the body.

1.  **Vitamin D** : Vitamin D emulsions are used to improve its solubility and absorption. These emulsions often contain vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and are utilized in both dietary supplements and pharmaceutical preparations.

1.  **Vitamin E** : Emulsions of vitamin E are widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic formulations due to its antioxidant properties. These emulsions help in better delivery and absorption of vitamin E in the body.

1.  **Vitamin K** : Vitamin K1 is also available in emulsified forms. These emulsions improve the stability and bioavailability of vitamin K, which is essential for blood clotting and bone health.

Emulsions are particularly beneficial for individuals with  **compromised digestion or absorption issues** , as they facilitate better uptake of these fat-soluble vitamins. For instance, emulsified vitamins are absorbed into the lymphatic system rather than the portal system, which can be advantageous for certain health conditions.

In summary, emulsions are a versatile and effective delivery method for all fat-soluble vitamins, enhancing their stability, bioavailability, and absorption.

#### 6-10% of people in the US do not have gallbladders, so have poor absorption of the fat-soluble forms of vitamins

There are 700,000 gall bladder surgeries annually in the US
