### [All pregnant women to be tested for Zika virus](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/UPDATE--All-pregnant-women-to-be-tested-for-Zika-virus) June 6

* 1,519 cases of  “suspected Zika fever” as of May 29

* 653 possible Zika: Kingston and St. Andrew 

* 620 possible Zika in St Catherine

 **Note:** 

1. A zika test only is useful if done within a week or so after a bite

> Report does not indicate how many Zika tests there will be during each Jamacan pregnancy

> 9 tests if done only monthly for entire pregnancy (all Zika birth defects)

> 3+ tests if done only during first trimester (microcephaly)

1. So much for the Jamacan tourist trade for this season

> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Jamaica)

> "The tourism industry earns over 50 % of the country's total foreign exchange earnings and provides about 25% of all jobs in Jamaica."

1. Jamaca is very close to Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Florida
