Background: Previous studies investigating the association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with prognosis of prostate cancer yielded controversial results. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship.

Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched for eligible studies up to July 15, 2018. We performed a dose-response meta-analysis using random-effect model to calculate the summary hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of mortality in patients with prostate cancer.

Results: Seven eligible cohort studies with 7,808 participants were included. The results indicated that higher vitamin D level could reduce the risk of death among prostate cancer patients. The summary HR of prostate cancer-specific mortality correlated with an increment of  **every 20 nmol/L in circulating vitamin D level was 0.91** , with 95% CI 0.87-0.97, P=0.002. The HR for all-cause mortality with the increase of 20 nmol/L vitamin D was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84-0.98, P=0.01). Sensitivity analysis suggested the pooled HRs were stable and not obviously changed by any single study. No evidence of publications bias was observed.

Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggested that higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was associated with a reduction of mortality in prostate cancer patients and vitamin D is an important protective factor in the progression and prognosis of prostate cancer.

Background

Vitamin D has a role in bone turnover and potentially bone-metastatic spread of prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this observational study was to address the association between levels of serum vitamin D, diagnosis of PCa and subsequent mortality in men who underwent a biopsy of the prostate.

Methods

All men who underwent prostatic biopsy in the Danish PCa Registry (DaPCaR) and who had a serum vitamin D measurement during the period 2004 to 2010 (n = 4,065) were identified. Men were categorized by clinical cut-offs based on seasonally adjusted serum vitamin D levels in <25 (deficient), 25–50 (insufficient), 50–75 (sufficient) and >75 nmol/L (high) serum vitamin D. Logistic regression model for association between vitamin D and risk of PCa diagnosis and multivariate survival analyses were applied.

Results

No association between serum vitamin D and risk of PCa was found. Overall survival was lowest for serum vitamin D deficiency and a significantly higher PCa specific mortality ( **HR: 2.37** , 95%CI: 1.45–3.90, p < .001) and other cause mortality (HR: 2.08, 95%CI: 1.33–3.24, p = .001) was found for PCa patients with serum vitamin D deficiency compared to serum vitamin D sufficiency.

Conclusion

No association was found between serum vitamin D categories and risk of PCa in men who underwent biopsy of the prostate. Men with PCa and serum vitamin D deficiency had a higher overall and PCa specific mortality compared to men with a sufficient level of serum vitamin D.
