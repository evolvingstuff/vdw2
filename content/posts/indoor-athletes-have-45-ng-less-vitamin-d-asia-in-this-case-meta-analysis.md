#### Difference in Levels of Vitamin D between Indoor and Outdoor Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Int J Mol Sci . 2023 Apr 20;24(8):7584. [doi: 10.3390/ijms24087584](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24087584) DOI: 10.3390/ijms24087584

Vitamin D, its importance in different processes taking place in the human body, the effects of abnormal levels of this hormone, either too low or too high, and the need for supplementation have been extensively researched thus far. Variances in exposure to sunlight can cause vitamin D levels to fluctuate. Indoor activity can be a factor for these fluctuations and can lead to a decrease in vitamin D levels. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to identify whether indoor compared to outdoor training has a significant influence on vitamin D levels; we also performed subgroup analyses and multivariate meta-regression. The type of training has an impact on vitamin D levels that is influenced by multiple cofounders. In a subgroup analysis not considering cofounders, the mean serum vitamin D was 3.73 ng/mL higher in outdoor athletes, a difference which barely fails to achieve significance (p = 0.052, a total sample size of 5150). 

The indoor-outdoor difference is only significant (clinically and statistically) when considering studies performed exclusively on Asian athletes (a mean difference of 9.85 ng/ml, p < 0.01, and a total sample size of 303). When performing the analyses within each season, no significant differences are observed between indoor and outdoor athletes. 

To control for multiple cofounders (the season, latitude, and Asian/Caucasian race) simultaneously, we constructed a multivariate meta-regression model, which estimated a serum vitamin D concentration lower by  **4.446**  ng/mL in indoor athletes. While a multivariate model suggests that outdoor training is associated with slightly higher vitamin D concentrations when controlling for the season, latitude, and Asian/Caucasian race, the type of training has a numerically and clinically small impact. This suggests that vitamin D levels and the need for supplementation should not be decided based on training type alone.

!!!!Difference in Levels of Vitamin D between Indoor and Outdoor Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Int J Mol Sci . 2023 Apr 20;24(8):7584. doi: 10.3390/ijms24087584 DOI: 10.3390/ijms24087584

Vitamin D, its importance in different processes taking place in the human body, the effects of abnormal levels of this hormone, either too low or too high, and the need for supplementation have been extensively researched thus far. Variances in exposure to sunlight can cause vitamin D levels to fluctuate. Indoor activity can be a factor for these fluctuations and can lead to a decrease in vitamin D levels. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to identify whether indoor compared to outdoor training has a significant influence on vitamin D levels; we also performed subgroup analyses and multivariate meta-regression. The type of training has an impact on vitamin D levels that is influenced by multiple cofounders. In a subgroup analysis not considering cofounders, the mean serum vitamin D was 3.73 ng/mL higher in outdoor athletes, a difference which barely fails to achieve significance (p = 0.052, a total sample size of 5150). 
The indoor-outdoor difference is only significant (clinically and statistically) when considering studies performed exclusively on Asian athletes (a mean difference of 9.85 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.01, and a total sample size of 303). When performing the analyses within each season, no significant differences are observed between indoor and outdoor athletes. 
To control for multiple cofounders (the season, latitude, and Asian/Caucasian race) simultaneously, we constructed a multivariate meta-regression model, which estimated a serum vitamin D concentration lower by __4.446__ ng/mL in indoor athletes. While a multivariate model suggests that outdoor training is associated with slightly higher vitamin D concentrations when controlling for the season, latitude, and Asian/Caucasian race, the type of training has a numerically and clinically small impact. This suggests that vitamin D levels and the need for supplementation should not be decided based on training type alone.
