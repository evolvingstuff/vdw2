Bipolar Disorder = BD = Manic Depression (BD name before 1980)

BD had been just in adults but has increased in children by perhaps 40X since 1980 

US appears to have the highest BD rate of any country

BD is partially treated by both  Omega-3 and Vitamin D

No data on BD prevention by Vitamin D or Omega-3

#### BD recurrence reduced by 6 months of Omega-3 - small RCT Jan 2024

 **Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the prevention of relapse in patients with stable bipolar disorder: A 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial** 

Psychiatry Research Volume 331 , January 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115633

Halliru Zailani a b c. Suet-Kei Wu a b, Kai-Jie Yang a g, Ikbal Andrian Malau a g, Hsien-Feng Liao a. etc.

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in relapse prevention of bipolar disorder (BD), addressing the shortcomings of current medications. Thirty-one stable BD patients were randomized to receive n-3 PUFAs or placebo for 6 months and intergroup differences in the incidence of the recurrence of bipolar depression were assessed. Differences in depression severity, manic symptoms, and routine biochemical parameters were also assessed. Interestingly, n-3 PUFAs demonstrated a favorable preventive effect on bipolar depression recurrence (p=0.005; Log-Rank) and reduced depression severity compared to placebo, and were well-tolerated, suggesting their potential as a safe prophylactic therapy for BD.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a significant cause of disability and mortality worldwide affecting over 1 % of the global population (Grande et al., 2016). The recurrence rate of BD is high and ranges from 35 to 57 % within 1 year (Shim et al., 2017), necessitating lifelong medications to prevent the disease recurrence. However, suboptimal compliance with these medications due to concerns about their potential adverse effects and toxicity has been reported (Bates et al., 2010; Malhi, 2015), underscoring the need for better-tolerated alternative medications.

Evidence suggests the beneficial effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in managing mood disorders with high tolerability (Su et al., 2014; Zailani et al., 2023) and may be good alternatives to BD medications. Notably, n-3 PUFAs deficiency, often accompanied by inflammation characterizes BD (Huang et al., 2022; McNamara and Welge, 2016). Interestingly, n-3 PUFAs have proven abilities to protect neurons and modulate inflammatory pathways, which could partly be responsible for their antidepressant effects.

Findings from previous studies of n-3 PUFAs in BD yielded incoherent results. 

* While some studies reported favorable effects of n-3 PUFAs in BD (Frangou et al., 2006; Stoll et al., 1999), 

* others reported no benefits (Chiu et al., 2003; Keck et al., 2006; McPhilemy et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2012). 

Of note, previous studies of n-3 PUFAs in BD were limited by

* a relatively short follow-up period,

* the use of DHA-predominant formulations, or a 

* lower dose of the n-3 PUFAs. 

Thus, this trial aimed to assess the prophylactic effects and tolerability of high-dose n-3 PUFAs in the prevention of relapse of bipolar depression.

 **[Examine.com has a summary of the study](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/dGrn59/?srsltid=AfmBOop3iiT7teNwgdv-af5WYFQnGf0pwp_ikgLrdBuEZJf6qLX5feYP)** 

* "The fish oil contained a total of 1,680 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 880 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as well as 8 mg of vitamin E."

* "This was a pilot study, and the findings should be considered preliminary, especially given the small sample size. In total, 8 participants experienced a recurrence of bipolar depression (2 in the omega-3 group, 6 in the placebo group)."

Introduction and objective:

Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a chronic mental condition associated with significant impairment of psychosocial functioning and premature mortality due to somatic comorbidities, as well as high rates of completed suicides. Unfortunately, results of currently available methods of treatment are unsatisfactory. Thus, new therapeutic solutions are sought. Recently, particular attention has been paid to the use of nutraceuticals, especially Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (n-3 PUFAs), as an adjunctive treatment in various mental disorders. The aim of the review is to show the role of PUFAs in the pathogenesis of BD, and present results of already conducted studies investigating n-3 PUFAs supplementation effects on the BD clinical course.

Materials and Method:

Internet scientific bases were searched throughout January and February 2024 for the relevant to this topic literature from the past 15 years, using keywords: “bipolar disorder”, “cardiovascular risk”, “mental disorders”, “omega-3 fatty acids”, “polyunsaturated fatty acids”, “remission”, “treatment”. Original and review articles were included. Manuscripts in other language than English were excluded from the search. To assess the proper quality of this manuscript, the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles were used.

Brief description of the state of knowledge:

There is lack of research assessing the importance of n-3 PUFAs in the treatment of BD. However, it seems that their supplementation may bring significant benefits in the acute phase of depression episode treatment, remission maintenance and reduction in cardiometabolic risk factors.

Summary:

Results of already conducted studies should be treated as a rationale for future research.  **It is highly recommended to confirm the n-3 PUFAs efficiency in the BD treatment** , to justify their widespread use in everyday clinical practice.

#### Vitamin D Status in Bipolar Disorder (no association found) - Nov 2023

Nutrients 2023, 15(22), 4752; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15224752

Vitamin D status may impact acute affective symptomatology and the severity of symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Therefore, this cross-sectional study analyzed 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)2D, and the vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR) in BD and correlated the results with clinical affective symptomatology and functionality. The inactive precursor 25(OH)D, and its principal catabolite 24,25(OH)2D, were measured simultaneously with a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method in 170 BD outpatients and 138 healthy controls. VMR was calculated as follows: VMR = 100×(24,25(OH)2D/25(OH)D). The psychometric assessment comprised: Beck Depression Inventory-II, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning, and number of suicide attempts.

 **We did not find a significant difference between patients and controls in the concentrations of 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)2D.**  Additionally, the VMR was comparable in both groups. The calculations for the clinical parameters showed a negative correlation between the Young Mania Rating Scale and 24,25(OH)2D (r = −0.154, p = 0.040), as well as the Young Mania Rating Scale and the VMR (r = −0.238, p = 0.015).

Based on the small effect size and the predominantly euthymic sample, further exploration in individuals with manic symptoms would be needed to confirm this association. In addition, long-term clinical markers and an assessment in different phases of the disease may provide additional insights.

 **Vitamin D levels much lower during mania phase** 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/drops-during-mania.jpg" alt="image" width="600">

Background: Bipolar disorder is a chronic psychiatric disorder with depression and manic episodes. It is one of the leading causes of disease-related disability worldwide. Despite the presence of various alternative drug options for bipolar disorder, some patients do not adequately benefit from the treatment. Therefore, possible underlying mechanisms need to be clarified. Recently, studies on the relationship between bipolar disorder and vitamin D (Vit D) have attracted attention. Although many studies have found an association between depression and Vit D deficiency, little is known about the relationship between manic episodes and Vit D. The aim of this study was to compare Vit D and related metabolites of bipolar manic episodes prior to treatment, bipolar remission after treatment, and healthy control groups.

Methods: This case-control study consisted of 34 bipolar manic episode patients and 34 healthy controls. Disease activity was evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Firstly, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) levels of patients in the bipolar manic episode were measured and compared with healthy control. Secondly, serum 25-OHD, Ca and P levels in the euthymic periods of the same patients were measured and compared with healthy control.

Results: Bipolar manic episode Vit D levels were lower when compared to healthy controls; while there was no difference in terms of Ca and P levels. There was no significant difference between the bipolar euthymic period patients and the healthy control group in terms of 25-OHD, Ca and P levels.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrated low serum Vit D concentrations in the acute manic episode of bipolar disorder. Decreased Vit D level may play a role in the onset of the manic episode, or malnutrition and insufficient sunlight during the manic episode may have caused Vit D deficiency. Future studies are needed to exclude potential confounding factors and to compare all mood episodes.

#### Vitamin D might help bipolar - Jan 2021

 **The role of vitamin D in bipolar disorder: Epidemiology and influence on disease activity** 

Journal of Affective Disorders Vol 278, 1 Jan 2021, Pages 209-217 [FREE PDF](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.039)

Background

Although many studies found an association between psychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder, and vitamin D deficiency, little is still known about the association between vitamin D and bipolar disorder (BD). Therefore, the present review aims at providing an overview of the available literature exploring the role of vitamin D in BD patients in different phases of the disease.

Methods

From a bibliographic research in PubMed until April 2020, we collected ten original studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.

Results

No significant differences in vitamin D levels between BD patients and other psychiatric disorders were found by most of the studies. In the majority of the studies, the average values of vitamin D in BD population were sub-threshold for vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, although an association between vitamin D levels and clinical symptomatology was observed in BD patients, it cannot be considered a specific marker of this disorder but a common characteristic shared with other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. Finally, vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in both depressive and manic symptoms.

Limitations

Few studies with small and heterogeneous populations. Methodological heterogeneity in terms of vitamin D measurement and threshold.

Conclusions

The results showed that vitamin D status does not differ between BD and other psychiatric conditions. However, given the correlation between vitamin D levels and depressive or manic symptoms, we could hypothesize that an adequate vitamin D status could positively affect the mood balance thanks to its immunomodulatory activity.

#### Bipolar strongly associated with poor VDR  (blood level vit D is a poor indicator) - March 2022

 **Abnormal pattern of vitamin D receptor-associated genes and lncRNAs in patients with bipolar disorder** 

BMC Psychiatry volume 22, Article number: 178 (2022)  [FREE PDF](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03811-8)

Background

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a multifactorial condition. Several signaling pathways affect development of this disorder. With the purpose of exploring the role of vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling in this disorder, we measured expression of selected mRNA coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this pathway in patients versus normal subjects.

Methods

We measured expression of VDR-associated lncRNAs and mRNAs (SNHG6, MALAT1, Linc00511, Linc00346, VDR and CYP27B1) in the peripheral blood of BD patients vs. healthy individuals.

Results

Expression of SNHG6 was significantly higher in cases vs. controls (Posterior beta = 1.29, P value < 0.0001. Subgroup analysis by sex revealed significant results in both subgroups (P value < 0.0001 and P value = 0.023 for males and females, respectively). Expression of CYP27B1 was up-regulated in cases vs. controls (Posterior beta = 0.415, P < 0.0001). Such pattern was also detected among males (P < 0.0001), but not females (P = 0.419). Similarly, MALAT1 and Linc00346 were up-regulated in total cases vs. controls (Posterior beta = 0.694, P < 0.0001 and Posterior beta = 0.4, P = 0.012, respectively) and in male cases compared with male controls (Posterior beta = 0.712, P < 0.0001 and Posterior beta = 0.41, P value = 0.038, respectively). Expression of VDR was up-regulated in total cases compared with controls (Posterior beta = 0.683, P value = 0.001). Finally, expression of Linc00511 was not different between groups. MALAT1, SNHG6, CYP27B1, VDR and Linc00346 had AUC values of 0.95, 0.94, 0.91, 0.85 and 0.83 in differentiation of male patients from controls, respectively.

Conclusion: The current study suggests VDR-associated genes as possible markers for BD.

#### More sunlight and higher temperature ==> more bipolar (opposite of Vitamin D association) - Dec 2021

 **The influence of weather on the course of bipolar disorder: A systematic review** 

The European J of Psychiatry Vol 35, Issue 4, Dec 2021, Pages 261-273 [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2021.03.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2021.03.002)

J.M.Montesa C.Serrano b A.Pascual-Sanchez c

Background and objectives

Several studies have addressed the relationship between bipolar disorder and meteorological variables, but no previous review focusing on the influence of a wide range of meteorological variables on bipolar disorder has been published. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review about the influence of weather on the clinical course of bipolar disorder patients.

Methods

Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the main electronic medical databases were searched in February 2020, and studies were screened based on the eligibility criteria. 24 studies were selected for qualitative synthesis. Most of them were observational retrospective studies based in medical records.

Results

The most studied meteorological variables were temperature and sunlight, and the most studied clinical outcomes were hospital admissions. Significant correlations were found between temperature and sunlight and clinical outcomes, although the findings were heterogeneous. Higher temperatures may trigger bipolar disorder relapses that require hospital admission, and higher expositions to sunlight may increase the risk of manic episodes.

Conclusion

Meteorological variables seem to have an influence in the course of bipolar disorder, especially temperature and sunlight, although further studies are needed to clarify this possible relationship.

OBJECTIVES

Previous work suggests supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may improve mood symptoms in bipolar disorder (BD) although findings remain unclear. In this study, we assess the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA administration for prophylaxis in BD using a clinical trial design over 52-weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04210804).

METHODS

Individuals with BD (n = 80) were randomised to receive placebo (n = 40) or  **1 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus 1 g docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; n = 40)**  adjunctively for 52-weeks. The primary outcome measure comprised the number of mood episode relapses including hospital admissions and medication changes experienced. Secondary outcome measures included time to first mood episode relapse and change in psychometric measures of depression and elation (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale).

RESULTS

No significant differences in the number of mood episode relapses (U = 490.00, p = 0.14) or the number of individuals requiring admission to hospital (χ2 = 0.67, p = 0.41) or medication adjustment in the omega-3 PUFA compared to the placebo group were noted. Time to relapse was not significantly different between groups (Log Rank χ2 = 0.41, p = 0.52). 

Change in Young Manic Rating Scale (F(3.12, 152.86) = 2.71, p = 0.05) was significantly different between treatment groups over 12-months, with scores at 9-months and 12-months significantly lower than those at 3-months in the omega-3 group and not in the placebo group. 

Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Global Clinical Impression and Global Assessment of Functioning were not different between groups.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite a minor reduction in hypomania scores in the omega-3 PUFA group compared to placebo, we find little evidence that the supplementation of omega-3-PUFAs exhibits prophylactic benefit in BD.

#### Less sun more Bipolar Disorder - Oct 2014

 **Relationship between sunlight and the age of onset of bipolar disorder: An international multisite study** 

Journal of Affective Disorders, Volume 167, 1 October 2014, Pages 104–111

Background

The onset of bipolar disorder is influenced by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. We previously found that a large increase in sunlight in springtime was associated with a lower age of onset. This study extends this analysis with more collection sites at diverse locations, and includes family history and polarity of first episode.

Methods

Data from 4037 patients with bipolar I disorder were collected at 36 collection sites in 23 countries at latitudes spanning 3.2 north (N) to 63.4 N and 38.2 south (S) of the equator. The age of onset of the first episode, onset location, family history of mood disorders, and polarity of first episode were obtained retrospectively, from patient records and/or direct interview. Solar insolation data were obtained for the onset locations.

Results: There was a large, significant inverse relationship between maximum monthly increase in solar insolation and age of onset, controlling for the country median age and the birth cohort. The effect was reduced by half if there was no family history. The maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in springtime. The effect was one-third smaller for initial episodes of mania than depression. The largest maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in northern latitudes such as Oslo, Norway, and warm and dry areas such as Los Angeles, California.

Limitations: Recall bias for onset and family history data.

Conclusions: A large springtime increase in sunlight may have an important influence on the onset of bipolar disorder, especially in those with a family history of mood disorders.

#### Mood disorders helped by Vitamin D, Omega-3, etc -Jan 2017

 **Clinical use of nutraceuticals in the adjunctive treatment of depression in mood disorders.** 

Australas Psychiatry. 2017 Jan 1:1039856216689533. [doi: 10.1177/1039856216689533.](https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856216689533.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Sarris J1. Pfessor of Integrative Mental Health, NICM, Western Sydney University, Campbelltown, NSW, and; Principal Research Fellow, The University of Melbourne, Department of Psychiatry, The Melbourne Clinic, Professorial Unit, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

OBJECTIVES:

The aim of this paper is to detail a summary of the current evidence in this area, to better inform clinical practice. Our recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of nutrient pharmacotherapies in the treatment unipolar depression revealed primarily positive results for replicated studies testing 

* S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), 

* methylfolate, 

* omega-3 (EPA or ethyl-EPA), and 

*  **Vitamin D** ; 

with supportive isolated studies found for creatine and an amino acid combination. Mixed results were found for zinc, folic acid, Vitamin C, and tryptophan; and non-significant study results for inositol. In bipolar depression, omega-3 and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) were found to have supportive evidence, with an isolated study using a chelated mineral formula also displaying efficacy. No major adverse effects were noted in the studies (aside from occasional minor digestive disturbances with omega-3 and NAC).

CONCLUSIONS:

Several clinical considerations are needed when psychiatrists are considering prescribing nutrients, including knowledge of drug interactions, supplement safety and quality issues, individual psychological and biochemical individualities, in addition to cost factors.
