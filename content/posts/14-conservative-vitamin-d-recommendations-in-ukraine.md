#### Ukrainian Consensus on Diagnosis and Management of Vitamin D Deficiency in Adults

Nutrients 2024, 16, 270. https://doi.org/10.3390/ nu16020270

Nataliia Grygorieva * , Mykola Tronko 2, Volodymir Kovalenko 3, Serhiy Komisarenko 4 , Tetiana Tatarchuk 5, Ninel Dedukh 1, Mykola Veliky 4®, Serhiy Strafun 6C , Yulia Komisarenko 7C , Andrii Kalashnikov 6 , Valeria Orlenko 2, Volodymyr Pankiv 8 , Oleg Shvets 9 , Inna Gogunska 10 and Svitlana Regeda 11

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a global problem, however, there were no Ukrainian guidelines devoted to its screening, prevention, and treatment, which became the reason for the Consensus creation. This article aimed to present the Consensus of Ukrainian experts devoted to VDD management. Following the creation of the multidisciplinary Consensus group, consent on the formation process, drafting and fine-tuning of key recommendations, and two rounds of voting, 14 final recommendations were successfully voted upon. Despite a recent decrease in VDD preva­lence in Ukraine, we recommend raising awareness regarding VDD's importance and improving the strategies for its decline. We recommend screening the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in risk groups while maintaining a target concentration of 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/mL). We recommend prophylactic cholecalciferol supplementation (800-2000 IU/d for youthful healthy subjects, and 3000-5000 IU/d for subjects from the risk groups). For a VDD treatment, we recom­mend a short-term administration of increased doses of cholecalciferol (4000-10,000 IU/d) with 25(OH)D levels monitored after 4-12 weeks of treatment, followed by the use of maintenance doses. Additionally, we recommend assessing serum 25(OH)D levels before antiosteoporotic treatment and providing vitamin D and calcium supplementation throughout the full course of the antiosteoporotic therapy.

##### Methodology of Consensus Development

The Consensus creation was performed by the multidisciplinary expert group consist­ing of 15 leading Ukrainian scientists who have extensive experience in studying vitamin D and related topics. The 1st (N.G.), 6th (N.D.), and 11th (V.O.) authors of this article were members of the Task Force group who coordinated the experts' work. Based on careful analysis of the current literature with a high level of evidence, the Task Force members formulated 14 recommendations regarding VDD epidemiology, its screening, prevention, therapy, and monitoring. Following the agreement on the formation pro­cess of the Consensus between experts, the  **Delphi method** , which is widely used for guideline creation <sup>[23,24]</sup>, was chosen. The voting was performed on the SurveyMonkey® (https://www.surveymonkey.com, San Mateo, CA, USA) platform using 9-point grading of agreement with the recommendations (1—strongly disagree, 3—disagree, 5—neutral, 7—agree, and 9—strongly agree). Before voting, the experts agreed that Consensus would be achieved when more than 75% of the experts were in agreement with a recommendation on a voting scale of 7 points or higher. Otherwise, voting was to be repeated after the experts' discussion and modification of the recommendation.

Two rounds of voting regarding each recommendation were held. The final Consensus recommendations are presented in the text of the article with their justification based on the current evidence before each recommendation.

Full version of the Consensus was presented for the first time in "Pain, Joints, Spine" journal <sup>[25]</sup> in Ukrainian for wider use by the medical community in Ukraine.

###### 9= strongly agree, 7= agree, 5 = neutral

##### 1 Recommend more Vitamin D Awareness

<span>[Consensus voting scale (CVS) (agreement level (AL)): 9 (100%)]</span>: Taking into account the high prevalence of VDD and VDI in the adult population of Ukraine, we recommend increasing awareness in the community about the current situation and positive pleiotropic (skeletal and extra-skeletal) effects of vitamin D in the human body to increase timely screening, adequate prevention, and treatment of VDD.

##### 2 Levels – deficiency to toxicity

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (80%), 7 (13%), 5 (7%)]</span>: We recommend using a serum level of total 25(OH)D as a laboratory marker for the diagnosis of VDD with the following criteria for determination of vitamin D status:

VDD: <50 nmol/L (<20 ng/mL);

VDI: >50 nmol/L (>20 ng/mL) and <75 nmol/L (<30 ng/mL);

Sufficient level of vitamin D: 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/mL);

Safe but not target level of vitamin D: >125-150 nmol/L (>50-60 ng/mL);

Zone of uncertainty with potential benefits or risks for vitamin D: >150-250 nmol/L (>60-100 ng/mL);

Excess/toxicity zone of vitamin D: >250 nmol/L (>100 ng/mL).

##### 3 High-Risk groups should be tested

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (80%), 7 (20%)]</span>: We do not recommend assessment of 25(OH)D serum level in adults without apparent indications, but we recommend it in persons from the following risk groups:

* Persons with dark skin pigmentation;

* Obese subjects (body mass index > 30 kg/m2);

* Pregnant and lactating females;

* Older subjects (>60 years old);

* Subjects with bone or muscle pain;

* Older subjects with a high risk of falls and a history of low trauma fractures;

* Patients with metabolic bone diseases (osteoporosis and osteomalacia);

* Immobilized persons and subjects during prolonged hospitalization;

* Patients with liver or kidney failure;

* Patients with endocrine disorders

> (I and II types of diabetes mellitus; hyperparathyroidism; thyroid diseases, etc.);

* Subjects with malabsorption syndromes

> (inflammatory bowel diseases, cystic fibrosis, enteritis after radiation, conditions after bariatric surgery, etc.);

* Patients with chronic autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythemato­sus, multiple sclerosis, etc.);

* Patients with malignancy;

* Subjects with granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, berylliosis, coccidioidomycosis, etc.);

* Persons with prolonged use of drugs with a negative impact on vitamin D metabolism 

> (gluco­corticoids, anticonvulsants, hypocholesterolemic, antifungal medications, AIDS drugs, etc.).

##### 4 Consider relationships to other serum ingredients

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (80%), 7 (20%)]</span>: In subjects with VDD, we recommend interpretation of 25(OH)D levels together with serum level of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, magnesium, and creatinine.

##### 5 Daily or weekly dosing

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (67.7%), 7 (33.3%)]</span>: For the prevention and treatment of VDD we recommend the prescription of the oral form (daily or weekly) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3); alternatively (vegetarianism, veganism, etc.), we recommend the oral form of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).

##### 6 800-2000 IU in winter

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (66.7%), 7 (26.7%), 5 (6.6%)]</span>:  For healthy adults without diseases and conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism in the human body, we recommend the prescription of cholecalciferol at a dose of 800-2000 IU/d (depending on body weight) from October to April due to a decreased level of endogenous vitamin D synthesis in the skin during this period.

##### 7 Some need 800-2000 IU all year long

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (87%), 7 (13%)]</span>: For the elderly, immobilized persons, and subjects with prolonged hospitalization with limited functional activity, we recommend the prescription of cholecalciferol in the dose of 800-2000 IU/d during the year.

##### 8 800-2,000 IU during pregnancy

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (87%), 7 (13%)]</span>: For females planning a pregnancy we recommend the prescription of cholecalciferol at a dose of 800-2000 IU/d and continue cholecalciferol use throughout pregnancy and lactation.

##### 9 Some conditions need 3,000 to 5,000 IU

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (80%), 7 (13%), 5 (7%)]</span>:  In the patients with diseases or conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism in the human body, we recommend the individual selection of a cholecalciferol prophylactic dose (3000-5000 IU/d) with achievement and maintenance of optimal 25(OH)D serum levels.

##### 10 Néed 4,000 -7,000 IU if have condition and <20 ng of Vitamin D

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (66.7%), 7 (26.7%), 5 (6.6%)]</span>: For subjects with confirmed VDD and without diseases or conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism, we recommend starting the treatment with higher doses (4000-7000 IU/d) of cholecalciferol compared to the prophylactic doses recommended for the overall population.

##### 11 Start with 10,000 IU daily if <20 ng and have problems related to low Vitamin D

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (66.7%), 7 (26.7%), 5 (6.6%)]</span>: For the subjects with confirmed VDD and diseases and conditions that affect vitamin D metabolism, we recommend starting the treatment using higher cholecalciferol doses (up to 10,000 IU/d) compared to doses recommended for healthy adults without additional risk factors.

##### 12 If <20 ng, treat till >30 ng, then drop back to 800-2000 IU

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (73%), 7 (20%), 5 (7%)]</span>: We recommend initiating the treatment of VDD at the serum 25(OH)D levels less than 50 nmol/L (<20 ng/mL). The treatment duration should be 4-12 weeks depending on the severity of VDD and other risk factors and should be continued until the target serum 25(OH)D level (75-125 nmol/L or 30-50 ng/mL) is reached. Afterward, we recommend using lower doses of cholecalciferol (800-2000 lU/d) to maintain optimal vitamin D status.

##### 13 Only use active vitamin D for chronic hyperparathyroidism or CKD Bone problems

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (60%), 7 (27%), 5 (13%)]</span>: We do not recommend active vitamin D metabolites for the treatment of VDD in subjects without diseases and conditions that affect vitamin D metabolism, however, we recommend them for the treatment of VDD in patients with chronic hyperparathyroidism or bone and mineral disorders associated with CKD.

##### 14 Osteroporosis

<span>[CVS (AL): 9 (66.7%), 7 (26.7%), 5 (6.6%)]</span>: For patients with osteoporosis and its complications we recommend determining the serum 25(OH)D level before initiating antiosteoporotic therapy to improve its effectiveness and safety profile.

##### Conclusions

Despite a recently decreased frequency of VDD in the Ukrainian population, the expert group recommends raising awareness among the medical and public community regarding VDD's importance and improving the strategies for its decline. We recommend screening the serum total 25(OH)D level in separate risk groups while maintaining a goal concentra­tion of 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/mL). Also, we recommend prophylactic cholecalciferol prescription (800-2000 IU/d for young, healthy subjects, and 3000-5000 IU/d for persons with diseases or conditions with negative effects on vitamin D metabolism). For the VDD treatment, the expert group recommends the short-term administration of higher cholecal­ciferol doses (4000-10,000 IU/d) with monitoring of 25(OH)D levels after 4-12 weeks of treatment, followed by the use of maintenance doses. Furthermore, we recommend the assessment of serum 25(OH)D levels before initiating therapy in patients with osteoporo­sis and providing a prescription of cholecalciferol (800-2000 IU/d) in combination with calcium (1000 mg/d of elemental calcium) throughout the full course of antiosteoporotic treatment (Table A1).
