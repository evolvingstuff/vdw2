 **Getting Vitamin D levels > 30 ng will:** 

1) Reduce the need for fertility clinics

2) Result in healthier mothers, infants, and children

3) Result in decreased miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature birth

4) Result in 5-10 fewer days off work during pregnancy and after birth if continue Vitamin D

 **Notes:** 

> 40 ng is even better than > 30 ng

Preconception dosing should start with a loading dose

&nbsp; &nbsp; Benefits start in weeks instead of 3-5 months

#### Feasibility and effectiveness of preconception check-ups at workplaces in Japan

J Occup Health. 2024 Apr 29:uiae021. [doi: 10.1093/joccuh/uiae021](https://doi.org/10.1093/joccuh/uiae021)

Objectives: Despite the recent increase in infertility and perinatal complications, preconception care is not commonly available in Japan. Working women are considered to have the greatest need for preconception care, as they increasingly marry and have children later in life. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of preconception check-ups in the workplace.

Methods: We provided 51 female employees aged 18-39 years with free preconception check-ups, including additional blood tests and an online medical questionnaire, during mandatory health check-ups at their workplace. A doctor provided online counselling based on the check-up results. We assessed fertility knowledge using the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS-J) and childbearing desire pre- and post-intervention.

Results: Preconception check-ups revealed various potential risk factors for future pregnancies, including underweight (12%), obesity (20%), Chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody positivity (22%), low Rubella IgG antibody levels (47%), iron deficiency (12%), and  **25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <30 ng/mL (98%)** . Post-intervention, the participants reported high satisfaction with the check-ups and significantly advanced their reproductive plans (P=0.008). Further, 95% of the participants indicated an intention to seek medical attention or make lifestyle changes. The post-intervention CFKS-J score (mean ± SD) was higher than the pre-intervention score (71.7 ± 19.3 versus 63.0 ± 22.0, P=0.006).

Conclusions: We developed a preconception check-up package that can be integrated into workplace health examinations, complemented by tailored counselling. This novel check-up package is a feasible and effective approach for improving preconception health and fertility awareness.

!!!!Feasibility and effectiveness of preconception check-ups at workplaces in Japan

Objectives: Despite the recent increase in infertility and perinatal complications, preconception care is not commonly available in Japan. Working women are considered to have the greatest need for preconception care, as they increasingly marry and have children later in life. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of preconception check-ups in the workplace.

Methods: We provided 51 female employees aged 18-39 years with free preconception check-ups, including additional blood tests and an online medical questionnaire, during mandatory health check-ups at their workplace. A doctor provided online counselling based on the check-up results. We assessed fertility knowledge using the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS-J) and childbearing desire pre- and post-intervention.

Results: Preconception check-ups revealed various potential risk factors for future pregnancies, including underweight (12%), obesity (20%), Chlamydia trachomatis IgG antibody positivity (22%), low Rubella IgG antibody levels (47%), iron deficiency (12%), and __25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &lt;30 ng/mL (98%)__. Post-intervention, the participants reported high satisfaction with the check-ups and significantly advanced their reproductive plans (P=0.008). Further, 95% of the participants indicated an intention to seek medical attention or make lifestyle changes. The post-intervention CFKS-J score (mean ± SD) was higher than the pre-intervention score (71.7 ± 19.3 versus 63.0 ± 22.0, P=0.006).

Conclusions: We developed a preconception check-up package that can be integrated into workplace health examinations, complemented by tailored counselling. This novel check-up package is a feasible and effective approach for improving preconception health and fertility awareness.
