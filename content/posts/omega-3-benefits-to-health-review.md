Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are considered as essential fatty acids for humans. These include alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3 ω-3), stearidonic acid (SDA; 18:4 ω-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 ω-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5 ω-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 ω-3). In the last few decades plenty of epidemiological studies have been conducted on a myriad health benefits of omega-3 PUFAs. 

In this review, we have summarized 

* structural features, 

* properties, 

* dietary sources, 

* metabolism, 

* bioavailability 

 **and health effects, such as**  

* cardiovascular disease, 

* diabetes, 

* cancer, 

* Alzheimer disease, 

* dementia, 

* depression, 

* visual and neurological development, 

* maternal and child health, 

of omega-3 PUFAs. 

Even though many health benefits of omega-3 PUFAs have been reported in the literature, there are also some controversies about their efficacy and certain benefits to human health.
