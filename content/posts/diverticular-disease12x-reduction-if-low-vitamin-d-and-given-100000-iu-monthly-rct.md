Background & aims

Some studies have linked low vitamin D status and high risk of diverticular disease, but the causal relationship between vitamin D and diverticular disease remains unclear; clinical trial data are warranted. The objective was to assess the efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on diverticular disease hospitalization.

Methods

Post-hoc analysis of a community-based randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) with 5108 participants randomized to receive monthly 100,000 IU vitamin D (n=2558) or identical placebo (n=2550). The outcome was time to first diverticular disease hospitalization from randomization to the end of intervention (July 2015), including a prespecified subgroup analysis in participants with baseline deseasonalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/L.

Results

Over a median of 3.3 years follow-up, 74 participants had diverticular disease hospitalization. There was no difference in the risk of diverticular disease hospitalization between vitamin D supplementation (35/2558=1.4%) and placebo (39/2550=1.5%) groups (adjusted hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span>=0.90; p=0.65), although in participants with deseasonalized 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L (n=1272), the  **risk was significantly lower in the vitamin D group than placebo (HR=0.08, p=0.02).** 

Discussion

Monthly 100,000 IU vitamin D3 does not reduce the risk of diverticular disease hospitalization in the general population. Further RCTs are required to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the diverticular disease in participants with low 25(OH)D levels.

 **RCT with 100,000 IU monthly** 

* Across all 2550 patients - not statistically significant

* For those 1272 who have Vitamin D levels  20ng - 12X improvement

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Results would probably have been even better if used a gut-friendly form of Vitamin D</span>**
