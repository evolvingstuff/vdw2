Aims

To evaluate the effect of vitamin D on insulin resistance and glycaemic control in prediabetes.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus, Web of Science and www.clinicaltrials.gov, together with a historical search through the reference lists of relevant articles until end of June 2014. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues in prediabetes and if they reported homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance or 2-h plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance test. Treatment effect was estimated according to mean difference in the changes from baseline of homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c between vitamin D and control groups. Meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed.

Results

A total of 10 randomized controlled trials were included. Vitamin D did not significantly improve homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose: the mean differences were -0.06 (95% CI -0.36 to 0.24) and -0.23 mmol/l (95% CI -0.65 to 0.19), respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that vitamin D improved homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance in a subgroup with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D â‰¥ 50 nmol/l <span>[mean difference -0.59 (95% CI -1.14 to -0.04); P=0.03]</span> and improved 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose in the subgroup with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 50 nmol/l [mean difference -0.68 mmol/l (95% CI -1.35 to -0.01); P=0.05](mean%20difference%20-0.68%20mmol/l%20(95%%20CI%20-1.35%20to%20-0.01);%20P=0.05). Vitamin D significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels. The mean differences were -0.10 mmol/l (95% CI -0.18 to -0.03), P=0.006 and -1 mmol/mol (95% CI -2 to 0), P=0.008, respectively.

Conclusions

No beneficial effect of vitamin D in improving insulin resistance was identified.

 **The above meta-analysis gave same weight to studies using tiny amounts of Vitamin D as studies which used a pharmacologically sufficient amount of Vitamin D**
