 **[One pill every two weeks gives you all the vitamin D most adults need](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)  
The ounce of prevention costs 1 hour of vitamin D per year  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 30 minutes to buy the vitamin D + 1 minute every 2 weeks to take the tiny capsule  
&nbsp;  
Thus: A hour of vitamin D prevents hundreds of hours of health problems  
&nbsp;  
OR: A hour of D keeps the Doctor away**

   * 60 hours a year of sweating is probably not as good for your health as 1 hour of vitamin D
