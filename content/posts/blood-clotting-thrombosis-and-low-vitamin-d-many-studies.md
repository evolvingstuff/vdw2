* "A thrombotic stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries that supply blood to your brain. A clot may be caused by fatty deposits (plaque) that build up in arteries and cause reduced blood flow (atherosclerosis) or other artery conditions."

* "[There are 2 kinds of ischemic stroke: thrombotic stroke (the most common type) and embolic stroke](https://www.texasheart.org/heart-health/heart-information-center/topics/types-of-strokes/)"

Vitamin D (VD) is a vital lipophilic secosteroid hormone known for its essential role in maintaining skeletal health and regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism. Recent evidence has begun to illuminate its significance beyond bone health, particularly in relation to thrombosis—a condition characterized by blood clot formation within the vascular system that can lead to serious cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. VD deficiency, defined as a plasma 25-hydroxyVD level below 25 nmol/L, affects a substantial portion of the global population, with prevalence rates ranging from 8% to 18%. This study systematically explores the relationships between VD levels and the risk of thrombosis, investigating the underlying mechanisms including VD's anticoagulant properties, influence on inflammatory pathways, and interactions with endothelial cells. Epidemiological data suggest that low serum levels of VD correlate with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), although the reported findings remain incon­sistent. 

Mechanisms that potentially link VD to thrombotic risk include modulation of thrombomodulin and tissue factor expression, as well as enhancement of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Given the prevalence of VD insufficiency, particularly among populations with limited exposure to sunlight, this research highlights the urgent need for strategies to increase VD levels through dietary modifications and supplementation in order to prevent thrombotic events.

Vitamin D, besides having an essential role in calcium and bone metabolism, also acts as a mediator of many non-calcemic effects through modulations of several biological responses. Vitamin D exists in its two major forms, vitamin D2, or commonly known as ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3, or commonly known as cholecalciferol. Both of these forms bind to vitamin D-binding protein to get transported to all vital target organs, where it serves as a natural ligand to vitamin D receptors for enabling their biological actions. Clinical reports corroborating vitamin D deficiency with an increase in thrombotic episodes implicate the role of vitamin D and its associated molecule in the regulation of thrombosis-related pathways. Thrombosis is the formation and propagation of a blood clot, known as thrombus. It can occur either in the arterial or the venous system resulting in many severe complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemia, and venous thromboembolism. Vitamin D, directly or indirectly, controls the expression of several genes responsible for the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. All of these are the processes of potential relevance to thrombotic disorders. This review, thus, discussed the effects of vitamin D on pathways involved in thrombosis, such as hemostatic process, inflammatory pathway, and endothelial cell activation, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms associated with them.
