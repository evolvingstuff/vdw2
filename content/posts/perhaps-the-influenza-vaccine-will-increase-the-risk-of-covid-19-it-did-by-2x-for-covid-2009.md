#### 4 radically different flu vaccine viewpoints - which are correct?

1. Flu vaccine will increase risk of COVID-19

1. Flu vaccine will not be needed this year -

   * South Africa typically has 1000 Influenza cases annually,but  this year had only one case

      * probably due to their wearing masks for COVID-19

1. Flu vaccine must be taken even more this year to avoid having hospital overloads

1. Vitamin D might might both prevent and treat COVID-19

   * The way it does with Influenza

#### Might Flu Shots Increase COVID-19 Pandemic Risk?- Mercola Sept 8, 2020

 **[URL](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/09/08/will-the-flu-shot-help-with-coronavirus.aspx?cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20200908Z1&mid=DM647787&rid=959572057)** 

 **Highlights** 

* People who received the trivalent influenza vaccine during the 2008-2009 flu season were between 1.4 and 2.5 times more likely to get infected with pandemic H1N1 in the spring and summer of 2009 than those who did not get the seasonal flu vaccine

* A double-blind, placebo-controlled study on ferrets confirmed the results, showing the seasonal influenza vaccine did worsen symptoms after subsequent exposure to the H1N1 virus

* A 2011 study found the seasonal flu vaccine may weaken children's immune systems and increase their chances of getting sick from influenza viruses not included in the vaccine

* In a 2012 study, children receiving inactivated influenza vaccines had a 4.4 times higher relative risk of contracting noninfluenza respiratory virus infections in the nine months following their inoculation

* A 2020 study found people were 36% more likely to get some form of coronavirus infection if they had been vaccinated against influenza

 **Conjecture** 

* "Some interesting data has become available which suggests that if you get immunized with the seasonal vaccine, you get less broad protection than if you get a natural infection …

* We may be perversely setting ourselves up that if something really new and nasty comes along, that people who have been vaccinated may in fact be more susceptible compared to getting this natural infection.”
