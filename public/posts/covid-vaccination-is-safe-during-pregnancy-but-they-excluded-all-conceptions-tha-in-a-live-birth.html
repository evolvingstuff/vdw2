#### COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy and Major Structural Birth Defects

Pediatrics e2024069778 https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2024-069778

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

COVID-19 vaccination is recommended during pregnancy; however, evidence on the prevalence of major structural birth defects born to people vaccinated early in pregnancy (≤20 weeks of gestation) is limited. We compared the prevalence of major structural birth defects by COVID-19 vaccination status and key strata: insurance provider, clinically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, and concomitant administration of other maternal vaccines. We also compared, head-to-head, the prevalence of birth defects by brand (Moderna mRNA-1273 vs Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2).

METHODS

A claims-based cohort study captured pregnancies ending in a live birth among people with an estimated last menstrual period between August 15, 2021, and December 24, 2021. Prevalence ratios comparing birth defects by exposure to COVID-19 vaccines were estimated using binomial regression with inverse probability treatment weights.

RESULTS

Among 78 052 pregnancies, we identified 1248 major structural birth defects (1049 &lt;span&gt;[160.6 per 10 000 live births]&lt;/span&gt; among unvaccinated people and 199 &lt;span&gt;[156.4 per 10 000 live births]&lt;/span&gt; among vaccinated people). No differences in the prevalence of major structural birth defects were observed given COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted prevalence ratio &lt;span&gt;[aPR]&lt;/span&gt;, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81–1.13). Findings were unchanged by insurance provider, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, and concomitant of other maternal vaccines. No differences in the prevalence of birth defects were observed among vaccinated people by brand (aPR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.77–1.37).

CONCLUSIONS

COVID-19 vaccination during early pregnancy is not associated with an increased prevalence of major structural birth defects in infants. These results support the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in early pregnancy.

#### 4 major possible problems with this study:

1. &quot;Our study excluded pregnancies ending early (due to spontaneous or medical abortion, ectopic and trophoblastic implantation, and stillbirth) and thus may be affected by live-birth bias: a form of selection bias that occurs when an exposure affects both diagnosis of the outcome and fetal survival.&quot;

1. They ignored possible reduction in conceptions due to vaccination

1. They ignored possible problems with vaccination AFTER 20 weeks of pregnancy

1. They ignored possible health problems in the infant which were notticed after birth

!!!!COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy and Major Structural Birth Defects 
Pediatrics e2024069778 https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2024-069778

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended during pregnancy; however, evidence on the prevalence of major structural birth defects born to people vaccinated early in pregnancy (≤20 weeks of gestation) is limited. We compared the prevalence of major structural birth defects by COVID-19 vaccination status and key strata: insurance provider, clinically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, and concomitant administration of other maternal vaccines. We also compared, head-to-head, the prevalence of birth defects by brand (Moderna mRNA-1273 vs Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2).

METHODS
A claims-based cohort study captured pregnancies ending in a live birth among people with an estimated last menstrual period between August 15, 2021, and December 24, 2021. Prevalence ratios comparing birth defects by exposure to COVID-19 vaccines were estimated using binomial regression with inverse probability treatment weights.

RESULTS
Among 78 052 pregnancies, we identified 1248 major structural birth defects (1049 [160.6 per 10 000 live births] among unvaccinated people and 199 [156.4 per 10 000 live births] among vaccinated people). No differences in the prevalence of major structural birth defects were observed given COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.81–1.13). Findings were unchanged by insurance provider, SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, and concomitant of other maternal vaccines. No differences in the prevalence of birth defects were observed among vaccinated people by brand (aPR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.77–1.37).

CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 vaccination during early pregnancy is not associated with an increased prevalence of major structural birth defects in infants. These results support the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in early pregnancy.

!!!!4 major possible problems with this study:
{DIV(style=&quot;font-size:17px;&quot;)}
#&quot;Our study excluded pregnancies ending early (due to spontaneous or medical abortion, ectopic and trophoblastic implantation, and stillbirth) and thus may be affected by live-birth bias: a form of selection bias that occurs when an exposure affects both diagnosis of the outcome and fetal survival.&quot;
#They ignored possible reduction in conceptions due to vaccination
#They ignored possible problems with vaccination AFTER 20 weeks of pregnancy
#They ignored possible health problems in the infant which were notticed after birth {DIV}
