#### Electro-scalp acupuncture regulates the expression of CYP27a1/b1, CYP24a and related inflammatory cytokines in ischemic cortex of rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion

. 2024 May 25;49(5):463-471. [doi: 10.13702/j.1000-0607.20221351.](https://doi.org/10.13702/j.1000-0607.20221351.)

Objectives: To observe the effect of electro-scalp acupuncture (ESA) on the expression of cytochrome P450a1/b1 (CYP27a1/b1), cytochrome P45024a (CYP24a), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)4, STAT6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-4 in ischemic cerebral cortex of rats with acute ischemic stroke, so as to explore its mechanism in alleviating inflammatory reaction of ischemic stroke.

Methods: Sixty SD rats were randomly divided into sham-operation, model, vitamin D3 and ESA groups, with 15 rats in each group. The middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model was established with thread ligation according to Zea-Longa's method. Rats in the vitamin D3 group were given 1, 25-VitD3 solution (3 ng·100 g-1·d-1) by gavage, once daily for 7 days. Rats in the ESA group were treated at bilateral anterior parietotemporal slash (MS6) with ESA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 1 mA),  **30 min a day for 7 days** . Before and after interventions, the neurological deficit score and neurobehavioral score were evaluated. TTC staining was used to detect the volume of cerebral infarction in rats. The positive expressions of CYP24a, CYP27a1 and CYP27b1 in the cerebral cortex of ischemic area were detected by immunofluorescence. The mRNA expressions of STAT4 and STAT6 in the cerebral cortex of ischemic area were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The protein expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4 in the cerebral cortex of ischemic area were detected by Western blot.

Results: Compared with the sham-operation group, the neurological deficit score, neurobehavioral score, the percentage of cerebral infarction volume, the positive expression level of CYP24a and mRNA expression level of STAT4, protein expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in cerebral cortex were increased (P<0.01), while the positive expression levels of CYP27a1/b1 and STAT6 mRNA, protein expression level of IL-4 were decreased (P<0.01) in the model group. After the treatment and compared with the model group, the neurological deficit score, neurobehavioral score, the percentage of cerebral infarction volume, the positive expression level of CYP24a and mRNA expression level of STAT4, protein expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in cerebral cortex were decreased (P<0.01), while the positive expression levels of CYP27a1/b1 and STAT6 mRNA expression level, protein expression level of IL-4 were increased (P<0.01) in the ESA and vitamin D3 groups.

Conclusions: ESA can alleviate the inflammatory response in ischemic stroke, which maybe related to its function in regulating the balance between CYP27a1/b1 and CYP24a, converting vitamin D into active vitamin D3, inhibiting vitamin D3 degradation, and regulating Th1/Th2 balance.

#### Might acupuncture regulate vitamin D genes ? Asked Perplexity AI May 2024

 **Answer** 

Yes, there is evidence that acupuncture may modulate the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes and related pathways.

* The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a nuclear receptor that mediates the biological effects of vitamin D. VDR regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in various physiological processes, including immune function, cell proliferation, and mineral homeostasis.

* A study found that specific genetic variants in the COMT and NFKB2 genes, which are involved in dopaminergic pathways and inflammatory signaling respectively, were associated with differential response to acupuncture treatment for insomnia in cancer survivors. This suggests acupuncture may modulate the expression or activity of these genes.

* The NFKB2 gene encodes a subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor, which is known to interact with the VDR and regulate vitamin D-responsive genes. Therefore, acupuncture's effects on NFKB2 could potentially influence VDR-mediated gene expression.

* While direct evidence is limited, the review by Ren et al. highlights the potential of traditional Chinese medicine and bioactive compounds in modulating VDR activity, suggesting acupuncture may have similar effects.

In summary, emerging evidence indicates that acupuncture can modulate the expression or activity of genes involved in dopaminergic, inflammatory, and transcriptional pathways that intersect with vitamin D signaling and VDR function. However, more research is needed to directly investigate acupuncture's effects on VDR gene regulation.
