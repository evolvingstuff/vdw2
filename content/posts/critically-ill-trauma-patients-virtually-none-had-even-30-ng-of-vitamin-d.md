Background

Vitamin D concentrations are associated with sepsis, pneumonia, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, the role of vitamin D in critically injured patients with trauma remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of vitamin D concentrations on outcomes in critically injured patients with trauma.

Methods

A prospective observational study was conducted by randomly selecting 100 patients among those who visited our trauma center. The serum vitamin D concentration was measured upon arrival at the hospital, and the length of stay in a trauma intensive care unit after admission, duration of mechanical ventilation, number of days spent in the hospital, development of complications, and death were investigated. The association between the surveyed variables and vitamin D concentrations was investigated using regression analysis.

Results

Of the 100 patients, 69 were men and 31 were women with an average age of 51.7 years. The average intensive care unit stay length was 18.4 days, and 6 patients (5.9%) died. Univariate regression analysis showed that the factors affecting patient mortality were age (p = 0.02), volume of blood transfused within 24 hours of arrival (p = 0.009), systolic blood pressure measured upon hospital arrival (p = 0.01), and serum lactate concentration measured upon hospital arrival (p = 0.03). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the factors affecting patient mortality were age (p = 0.01), volume of blood transfusion (p = 0.04), and systolic blood pressure measured upon hospital arrival (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

There were no statistically significant effects of serum vitamin D concentrations in critically ill patients with trauma on death during hospitalization.

Vitamin D concentrations are associated with sepsis, pneumonia, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, the role of vitamin D in critically injured patients with trauma remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of vitamin D concentrations on outcomes in critically injured patients with trauma.

A prospective observational study was conducted by randomly selecting 100 patients among those who visited our trauma center. The serum vitamin D concentration was measured upon arrival at the hospital, and the length of stay in a trauma intensive care unit after admission, duration of mechanical ventilation, number of days spent in the hospital, development of complications, and death were investigated.

Univariate regression analysis showed that the factors affecting patient mortality were age (p = 0.02), volume of blood transfused within 24 hours of arrival (p = 0.009), systolic blood pressure measured upon hospital arrival (p = 0.01), and serum lactate concentration measured upon hospital arrival (p = 0.03). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the factors affecting patient mortality were age (p = 0.01), volume of blood transfusion (p = 0.04), and systolic blood pressure measured upon hospital arrival (p = 0.01).

Conclusions
There were no statistically significant effects of serum vitamin D concentrations in critically ill patients with trauma on death during hospitalization.
