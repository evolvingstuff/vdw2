#### Effect of oral systemic administration of vitamin D on the rate of maxillary canine retraction: A randomized controlled trial

Journal of Oral Biology and Craniofacial Research Volume 15, Issue 2, March–April 2025, Pages 281-287 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobcr.2025.01.017

Objective

The trial was conducted to determine the effects of systemically delivered Vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol) on the rate of maxillary canine retraction till the space closure and on the root resorption.

Materials and methods

A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with Angle's Class I bimaxillary protrusion requiring at least upper first premolars extraction and distal movement of canine for malocclusion correction. The enrolled patients were randomized and allocated to the experimental group (Oral Vitamin D = 0.25 μg given) and control group (Placebo given). The canine retraction was initiated using nickel-titanium (NiTi) closed coil springs delivering a force of 100 gm per side and Vitamin D levels were monitored at monthly intervals. The patients' casts were digitally scanned and examined for differences in the rate of canine retraction at initial (T0), 4 weeks (T1), 8 weeks (T2), 12 weeks (T3), 16 weeks (T4) and 20 weeks (T5) intervals were calculated. The volumetric root resorption was done on CBCT of the area of interest at T0 and after completion of retraction. Descriptive statistics and paired t-test were used to determine any differences.

Results

32 patients (18–24 years) were randomized in the experimental group (n = 16) and control group (n = 16) and no dropout was noted till the end of the study. The results showed a statistically significant increase in the rate of canine retraction in the experimental group as compared to the control group at different time intervals. The differences in the mean canine retraction between group 1 and group 2 at T1-T0, T2-T1, T3-T2, T4-T3, and T4-T0 were 0.28 ± 0.12, 0.29 ± 0.10, 0.31 ± 0.08, 0.37 ± 0.06 and 1.18 ± 0.10 mm respectively. The total mean canine retraction for group 1 was achieved at T4 time interval while it was achieved at T5 interval for group 2. The intergroup comparison of maxillary canine roots showed no statistically significant difference in volumetric root resorption.

Conclusion

The active form of vitamin D can be an effective agent to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement (OTM).

##### Everyone started at 31 ng, 0.25 μg Calcitriol ==> 44 ng at 4 months, should have started BEFORE extraction

##### Why they did not use loading dose vitamin D?
