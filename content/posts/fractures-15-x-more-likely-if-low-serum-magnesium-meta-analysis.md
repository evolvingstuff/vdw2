Magnesium, an essential cation for numerous cellular processes, is a major component of bone. However, its relationship with the risk of fractures is still uncertain. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the impact of serum Mg on the risk of incident fractures. A systematic search was conducted using several databases including PubMed/Medline and Scopus from inception to 24 May 2022, including observational studies investigating serum Mg and the incidence of fractures considered as outcomes. Abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments were conducted by two investigators independently. Any inconsistencies were resolved by consensus with a third author. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess the study quality/risk of bias. Among 1332 records initially screened, 16 were retrieved as full-texts; of them, four papers were included in the systematic review with a total of 119,755 participants. 

We found that lower serum Mg concentrations were associated with a significantly higher risk of incident fractures (RR = 1.579; 95%CI: 1.216–2.051; p = 0.001; I2 = 46.9%). Our systematic review with meta-analysis suggests a strong association of serum Mg concentrations with incident fractures. Further research is needed to confirm our results among other populations and to assess whether serum Mg is potentially relevant in the prevention of fractures, which continue to increase and represent a significant health burden due to the associated disability.

Magnesium, an essential cation for numerous cellular processes, is a major component of bone. However, its relationship with the risk of fractures is still uncertain. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the impact of serum Mg on the risk of incident fractures. A systematic search was conducted using several databases including PubMed/Medline and Scopus from inception to 24 May 2022, including observational studies investigating serum Mg and the incidence of fractures considered as outcomes. Abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments were conducted by two investigators independently. Any inconsistencies were resolved by consensus with a third author. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess the study quality/risk of bias. Among 1332 records initially screened, 16 were retrieved as full-texts; of them, four papers were included in the systematic review with a total of 119,755 participants. 
We found that lower serum Mg concentrations were associated with a significantly higher risk of incident fractures (RR = 1.579; 95%CI: 1.216–2.051; p = 0.001; I2 = 46.9%). Our systematic review with meta-analysis suggests a strong association of serum Mg concentrations with incident fractures. Further research is needed to confirm our results among other populations and to assess whether serum Mg is potentially relevant in the prevention of fractures, which continue to increase and represent a significant health burden due to the associated disability.
