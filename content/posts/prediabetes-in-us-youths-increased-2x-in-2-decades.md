The US Preventive Services Task Force recently released a recommendation on screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes among adults,1 but no recommendation has been issued for youths to date. A recent study2 estimated that among youths aged 12 to 19 years, approximately 1 in 5 had prediabetes, with large variations across sociodemographic characteristics. However, trends in the prevalence of prediabetes among youths and associated disparities by population subgroups over the past 2 decades have not been reported to our knowledge, and such information is important for future diabetes prevention. In this study, we assessed trends in prediabetes among US youths from 1999 through 2018.
