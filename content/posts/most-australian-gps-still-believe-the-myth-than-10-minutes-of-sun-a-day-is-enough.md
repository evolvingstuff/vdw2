This study aimed to assess the attitudes, practices and knowledge of general practitioners (GPs) with regards to vitamin D. A cross-sectional survey of a random sample of GPs stratified by location of practice (rural/remote or metropolitan) and employment status (full-time or part-time) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia was conducted. 

Of 500 respondents, 

*  **58.1%**  (95% CI 53.8-62.4) reported that up to  **39% of their tested patients showed vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency**  and a further 

*  **37.7%**  (95% CI 33.5-41.9) of respondents said that over  **40%**  of their patients were vitamin D insufficient. 

Vitamin D supplementation and advice to receive more natural sunlight were the most common ways vitamin D insufficiency was managed (97.1%; 95% CI 95.6-98.6 and 82%, 95% CI 78.6-85.4, respectively). 

Some gaps in knowledge were identified. 

*  **Most respondents (64%** ; 95% CI 59.8-68.2) believed that a person of average sun sensitivity required  **10 minutes**  of direct sun exposure during summer in peak UV time and a further 

*  **21.6%**  (95% CI 18.0-25.2) believed that people required  **30 minutes of direct sun** . 

* A third of respondents (33.1%; 95% CI 29.0-37.2) advised their patients to use sun protection at all times during winter. 

In general, the attitude items showed that respondents expressed greater concern about vitamin D deficiency than skin cancer. The results reveal some confusion in general practice regarding vitamin D, sun exposure, sun protection and skin cancer risk. Some of the advice GPs are offering may needlessly increase their patients' risk for vitamin D insufficiency or skin cancer.
