Purpose The management of psoriasis remains a challenge for dermatologist and patient. This study aimed to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation improves psoriasis compared to placebo. 

Materials and methods In a randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 101 participants ≥18 years with psoriasis were grouped by severity and allocated to 100,000 International Units (IU) vitamin D3/month for 12 months (200,000 IU at baseline; n = 67) or an identical placebo (n = 34). Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and serum 25(OH)D concentrations were assessed at 3-monthly intervals. The primary outcome was the difference in PASI between groups over time. The relationship between 25(OH)D and PASI across the sample was also considered in a post hoc analysis. 

Results PASI did not differ between groups at any time (group F(1,104)=0.48, P = 0.49; group*time F(4,384)=0.26, P = 0.90). However, 25(OH)D increased in both groups, rendering these findings inconclusive. A significant inverse relationship existed between PASI and 25(OH)D, with elevation of 25(OH)D by up to 125 nmol/L associated with mild decreases in PASI (estimated range of decrease 0 - 2.6; P = 0.002).
