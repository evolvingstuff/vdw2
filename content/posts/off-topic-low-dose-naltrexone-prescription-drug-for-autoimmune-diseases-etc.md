**[Low-dose naltrexone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-dose_naltrexone) Wikipedia** 

* " off-label use of the medication naltrexone at low doses for diseases such as Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis"

* "Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, meaning it binds to opioid receptors in cells"

* "Low-dose naltrexone refers to doses at about 1/10th the size of the dose used normally."

* "One hypothesis behind low-dose naltrexone's mechanism of action is that inhibiting opioid receptors at low doses might cause the body to increase production of endorphins and upregulate the immune system."

* "LDN can act as an immunomodulator in multiple autoimmune diseases and malignant tumors as well as alleviate the symptoms of some mental disorders. The results of increasing studies indicate that LDN exerts its immunoregulatory activity by binding to opioid receptors in or on immune cells and tumor cells." &nbsp; &nbsp; [doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2018.05.020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2018.05.020)
