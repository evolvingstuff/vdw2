Background and Aim

25-Hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> has an important role in fibrosis progression and inflammatory response in patients with various etiologies of chronic liver disease. However, its influence on autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has not been investigated. We evaluated the association of serum 25(OH)D levels with clinical, biochemical and histological features and response to therapy in AIH.

Materials and methods: Serum 25(OH)D levels were quantified in 68 therapy naïve AIH patients and 34 healthy controls.

Results

Mean serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in AIH compared to healthy controls (16.8 ± 9.2 vs. 35.7 ± 13.6, p < 0.0001). Low levels of 25(OH)D (<30 µg/L) were independently associated with advance fibrosis and severe interface hepatitis in AIH patients <span>[p = 0.014; odds ratio (OR) 0.12, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.02–0.65 and p = 0.020; OR 0.17, 95 % CI 0.04–0.76, respectively]</span>. 

Severe 25(OH)D deficiency (<10 µg/L) was associated with 

* advance fibrosis, 

* severe interface hepatitis, 

* low platelet counts and 

* sampling time in a univariate analysis. 

Only interface hepatitis and fibrosis scores were independently associated with 25(OH)D deficiency in a multiple regression analysis (p = 0.005; OR 0.12, 95 % CI 0.03–0.53 and p = 0.022; OR 0.15, 95 % CI 0.03–0.75, respectively). 

Mean serum 25(OH)D levels were lower in non-responders compared to responders (9.2 ± 4.8 vs. 17.1 ± 9.4, p = 0.015), and 25(OH)D deficiency was more commonly observed in non-responders than the responders (80 vs. 43 %, p = 0.036).

Conclusions

Low 25(OH)D levels are associated with advance fibrosis and severe inflammation in AIH. Our study suggests that vitamin D may be a potential biomarker that predicts response to therapy and histological features in AIH.

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is linked to worse outcomes in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). However, data in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) remain limited.

Aims: We aimed to assess the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the outcomes of individuals with AIH.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX research network to identify patients with AIH. Patients were matched using propensity score matching and stratified to sufficient vitamin D levels (e.g., 25 (OH) D3 ≥ 30 ng/mL), vitamin D insufficiency (25 (OH) D3: 20-29.9 ng/mL) and vitamin D deficiency (e.g., 25 (OH) D3 < 20 ng/mL). The primary outcome was the all-cause mortality among adult patients with AIH. Secondary outcomes included decompensated liver cirrhosis, acute hepatic failure, liver transplantation (LT), all-cause hospitalizations and all-cause critical care admissions.

Results: A total of 1288 AIH patients with vitamin D deficiency were identified and propensity matched with 1288 patients with normal vitamin D levels. 

Patients with vitamin D deficiency had significantly increased odds for

* all-cause mortality compared to those with normal levels (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.2, 95%CI: 2.3-4.48). 

Patients with vitamin D deficiency were at increased odds of 

* all-cause hospitalizations (aOR = 2.37, 95%CI: 1.97-2.84), 

* critical care unit admissions (aOR = 2.8, 95%CI: 2.21-3.71), 

* decompensated liver cirrhosis (aOR = 2.74, 95%CI: 2.13-3.54), 

* acute hepatic failure (aOR = 3.11, 95%CI: 2.09-4.62) and 

* LT (aOR = 3.47, 95%CI: 1.71-7.04), as compared to those with normal vitamin D levels.

Conclusion: This cohort study showed significantly increased odds for all-cause mortality in AIH patients with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with AIH was associated with increased likelihood of hospitalisation, decompensated liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure and LT.
