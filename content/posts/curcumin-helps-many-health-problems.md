#### Curcumin helps 9 health measures - umbrella meta-analysis June 2024

Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2024 Jun 28:174:106867. [doi: 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2024.106867](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2024.106867)

 **The effects of curcumin supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function: A meta-analysis of meta-analyses** 

Zeynab Kavyani 1, Kianoosh Najafi 2, Navid Naghsh 3, Houshang Bavandpour Karvane 4, Vali Musazadeh 5

Numerous interventional studies have revealed the beneficial impact of curcumin supplementation on inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function biomarkers, but the findings are still inconsistent. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of curcumin supplementation on inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function biomarkers. A meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials was performed by searching PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science up to March 31, 2024. Pooled estimates of 21 meta-analyses revealed that curcumin 

 **significantly reduced**  

* CRP (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.87; 95 % CI: - 1.14, - 0.59, P< 0.001), 

* tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (WMD = -2.72; 95 % CI: -4.05, -1.38; P< 0.001), 

* interleukin-6 (IL-6) (WMD = -0.97, 95 % CI: -1.40, -0.54; P< 0.001), 

* malondialdehyde (MDA) (Effect size (ES) = -0.81; 95 % CI: -1.39, -0.23, P = 0.006) and 

* pulse wave velocity (PWV) (WMD = -45.60; 95 % CI: -88.16, -3.04, P = 0.036)

 **and signicantly increased** 

* flow-mediated dilation (FMD) (WMD = 1.64, 95 % CI: 1.06, 2.22, P < 0.001), 

* catalase (CAT) (WMD = 10.26; 95 % CI: 0.92, 19.61, P= 0.03), 

* glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (WMD = 8.90; 95 % CI: 6.62, 11.19, P <0.001), and

* superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels (WMD = 20.51; 95 % CI: 7.35, 33.67, P= 0.002 and 

* SMD = 0.82; 95 % CI: 0.27, 1.38, P= 0.004). 

However, curcumin did not significantly change total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (ES = 0.29; 95 % CI: -0.09, 0.66, P= 0.059). These results suggest that curcumin has a beneficial effect on CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, SOD, GPx, CAT, MDA, PWV, and FMD levels and may be an effective adjunctive therapy for improving inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial function. 

 **[Overview of study at Examine.com](https://examine.com/research-feed/study/1PJkR9/)** 

* "An umbrella meta-analysis of 19 meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials was performed. The daily dose of curcumin ranged from 100 mg to 1,900 mg, with an average daily dose of 824 mg. The intervention duration ranged from 4.5 to 15 weeks, with an average duration of around 9 weeks."

It is extensively verified that continued oxidative stress and oxidative damage may lead to chronic inflammation, which in turn can mediate most chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological, inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary diseases. Curcumin, a yellow coloring agent extracted from turmeric, shows strong anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities when used as a remedy for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. How oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways leading to the progression of chronic diseases is the focus of this review. Thus, research to date suggests that chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and most chronic diseases are closely linked, and the antioxidant properties of curcumin can play a key role in the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation diseases.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. High blood sugar can produce long-term complications such as cardiovascular and renal disorders, retinopathy, and poor blood flow. Its development can be prevented or delayed in people with impaired glucose tolerance by implementing lifestyle changes or the use of therapeutic agents. Some of these drugs have been obtained from plants or have a microbial origin, such as galegine isolated from Galega officinalis, which has a great similarity to the antidiabetic drug metformin. Picnogenol, acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose are other antidiabetic products of natural origin. This review compiles the principal articles on medicinal plants used for treating diabetes and its comorbidities, as well as mechanisms of natural products as antidiabetic agents. Inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase, effects on glucose uptake and glucose transporters, modification of mechanisms mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity, modification of gene expression, and activities of hormones involved in glucose homeostasis such as adiponectin, resistin, and incretin, and reduction of oxidative stress are some of the mechanisms in which natural products are involved. We also review the most relevant clinical trials performed with medicinal plants and natural products such as aloe, banaba, bitter melon, caper, cinnamon, cocoa, coffee, fenugreek, garlic, guava, gymnema, nettle, sage, soybean, green and black tea,  **turmeric** , walnut, and yerba mate. 

Compounds of high interest as potential antidiabetics are:  **fukugetin, palmatine, berberine, honokiol, amorfrutins, trigonelline, gymnemic acids, gurmarin, and phlorizin.**

Curcumin is the yellow-colored bioactive constituent of the perennial plant, Curcuma longa L., which possesses a wide range of physiological and pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective and anti-diabetic activities. Anti-diabetic activity of curcumin may be due to its potent ability to suppress oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, it shows a beneficial role on the diabetesinduced endothelial dysfunction and induces a down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappa B. Curcumin possesses a protective role against advanced glycation as well as collagen crosslinking and through this way, mitigates advanced glycation end products-induced complications of diabetes. Curcumin also reduces blood glucose, and the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic rat through the regulation of polyol pathway. It also suppresses increased bone resorption through the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and expression of the AP-1 transcription factors, c-fos and c-jun, in diabetic animals. Overall, scientific literature shows that curcumin possesses anti-diabetic effects and mitigates diabetes complications. Here we report a systematical discussion on the beneficial role of curcumin on diabetes and its complications with emphasis on its molecular mechanisms of actions.

The concept of using phytochemicals has ushered in a new revolution in pharmaceuticals. Naturally occurring polyphenols (like curcumin, morin, resveratrol, etc.) have gained importance because of their minimal side effects, low cost and abundance. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a component of turmeric isolated from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. 

Research for more than two decades has revealed the pleiotropic nature of the biological effects of this molecule. 

More than 7000 published articles have shed light on the various aspects of curcumin including its 

* antioxidant, 

* hypoglycemic, 

* anti-inflammatory and 

* anti-cancer activities. 

Apart from these well-known activities, this natural polyphenolic compound also exerts its beneficial effects by modulating different signalling molecules including transcription factors, chemokines, cytokines, tumour suppressor genes, adhesion molecules, microRNAs, etc. 

Oxidative stress and inflammation play a pivotal role in various diseases like

*  **diabetes** , 

* cancer, 

* arthritis, 

* Alzheimer's disease and 

* cardiovascular diseases. 

Curcumin, therefore, could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of these diseases, provided limitations in its oral bioavailability can be overcome. The current review provides an updated overview of the metabolism and mechanism of action of curcumin in various organ pathophysiologies. The review also discusses the potential for multifunctional therapeutic application of curcumin and its recent progress in clinical biology.

It is known that there is a significant interplay of insulin resistance, oxidative stress, dyslipidemia, and inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study was undertaken to investigate the effect of turmeric as an adjuvant to anti-diabetic therapy. Sixty diabetic subjects on metformin therapy were recruited and randomized into two groups (30 each). Group I received standard metformin treatment while group II was on standard metformin therapy with turmeric (2 g) supplements for 4 weeks. The biochemical parameters were assessed at the time of recruitment for study and after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Turmeric supplementation in metformin treated type 2 diabetic patient significantly decreased 

* fasting glucose (95 ± 11.4 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and 

* HbA1c levels (7.4 ± 0.9 %, P < 0.05). 

Turmeric administered group showed reduction in lipid peroxidation, MDA (0.51 ± 0.11 µmol/l, P < 0.05) and enhanced total antioxidant status (511 ± 70 µmol/l, P < 0.05). Turmeric also exhibited beneficial effects on dyslipidemia LDL cholesterol (113.2 ± 15.3 mg/dl, P < 0.01), non HDL cholesterol (138.3 ± 12.1 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and LDL/HDL ratio (3.01 ± 0.61, P < 0.01) and reduced inflammatory marker, hsCRP (3.4 ± 2.0 mg/dl, P < 0.05). Turmeric supplementation as an adjuvant to T2DM on metformin treatment had a beneficial effect on blood glucose, oxidative stress and inflammation.

#### Nanotechnology-Applied Curcumin for Different Diseases Therapy - 2014

Curcumin is a lipophilic molecule with an active ingredient in the herbal remedy and dietary spice turmeric. It is used by different

folks for treatment of many diseases. Recent studies have discussed  **poor bioavailability of curcumin because of poor absorption** ,

rapid metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination. 

Nanotechnology is an emerging field that is potentially changing the way we can treat diseases through drug delivery with curcumin. The recent investigations established several approaches to 

* improve the bioavailability, 

* to increase the plasma concentration, and 

* to enhance the cellular permeability processes of curcumin. 

Several types of nanoparticles have been found to be suitable for the encapsulation or loading of curcumin to improve its therapeutic effects in different diseases. Nanoparticles such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, micelles, nanogels, niosomes, cyclodextrins, dendrimers, silvers, and solid lipids are emerging as one of the useful alternatives that have been shown to deliver therapeutic concentrations of curcumin. This review shows that curcumin’s therapeutic effects may increase to some extent in the presence of nanotechnology. The presented board of evidence focuses on the valuable special effects of curcumin on different diseases and candidates it for future clinical studies in the realm of these diseases
