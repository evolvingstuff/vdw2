The fructose added to soft drinks and processed food, as well as frequent detection of vitamin D deficiency in the body, are two insults increasingly considered to cause lesions in target organs. We studied the liver after a chronic high-fructose diet deficient and supplemented with vitamin D. Sixty C57BL/6 mature male mice were allocated into six groups (n = 10) for ten weeks: control (C), control deficient in vitamin D (CDD), control supplemented with vitamin D (CDS), fructose (F), fructose deficient in vitamin D (FDD), and fructose supplemented with vitamin D (FDS). The gene expressions of vitamin D receptor and CYP27B1 and 25 hydroxyvitamin D plasma level ensured that the diets caused vitamin D deficiency or supplementation. Body mass did not change, but blood pressure (BP) increased in CDD, F, and FDD, whereas BP was controlled in FDS. Insulinemia, insulin tolerance and resistance were seen in both vitamin D deficiency and fructose groups but improved with vitamin D supplementation. The steatosis and fibrosis were observed in the CDD, F and FDD groups. Also, F and FDD showed activation of stellate cells (HSC). Lipogenesis and inflammation gene expressions were enhanced in the CDD, F and FDD groups, but diminished with vitamin D supplementation. In conclusion, we demonstrated the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on metabolism, liver steatosis and, combined with fructose intake, liver interstitial fibrosis with hepatic stellate cell activation, and alteration of the lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, and liver inflammation.  **All these data improved when vitamin D was supplemented in the animals.**
