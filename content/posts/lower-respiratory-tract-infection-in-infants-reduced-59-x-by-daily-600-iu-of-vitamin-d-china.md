Vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be associated with respiratory tract infection (RTI). However, evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation on susceptibility of infants to RTI is limited. In this prospective birth cohort study, we examined whether vitamin D supplementation reduced RTI risk in 2,244 infants completing the follow-up from birth to 6 months of age. The outcome endpoint was the first episode of paediatrician-diagnosed RTI or 6 months of age when no RTI event occurred. Infants receiving vitamin D supplements at a daily dose of 400-600 IU from birth to the outcome endpoint were defined as vitamin D supplementation and divided into four groups according to the average frequency of supplementation: 0, 1-2, 3-4, and 5-7 days/week. We evaluated the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and time to the first episode of RTI with Kaplan-Meier plots. The associations of vitamin D supplementation with infant RTI,  **Lower RTI (LRTI)** , and RTI-related hospitalization were assessed using modified Poisson regression. The median time to first RTI episode was 60 days after birth (95% CI <sup>[60, 90]</sup>) for infants without supplementation and longer than 6 months of age for infants with supplementation (p < .001). 

We observed inverse trends between supplementation frequency and risk of RTI, LRTI, and RTI-related hospitalization (p for trend < .001), with the risk ratios in the 5-7 days/week supplementation group of 0.46 (95% CI <span>[0.41, 0.50]</span>), 0.17 (95% CI <span>[0.13, 0.24]</span>), and 0.18 (95% CI <span>[0.12, 0.27]</span>), respectively. These associations were significant and consistent in a subgroup analysis stratified by infant feeding.
