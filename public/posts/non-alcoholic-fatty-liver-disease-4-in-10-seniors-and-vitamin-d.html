However, the causality between them has not been established. We used bi-directional mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the causal relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and NAFLD.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>9182 participants were included from a survey in East China from 2014 to 2016. We calculated weighted genetic risk scores (GRS) for 25(OH)D concentration and NAFLD based on 25(OH)D-related and NAFLD-related single nucleotide polymorphisms.

An SD increase in NAFLD GRS was also strongly associated with NAFLD (OR 1.09, 95%CI 1.04, 1.15, P&lt;0.05) but not with 25(OH)D (β -0.15, 95%CI -0.41, 0.10).

Forty-two patients (the ratio of men to women was 13:29) had hypovitaminosis D (plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> &lt;30 ng/mL).</p><p>An observational study was performed in NAFLD patients with hypovitaminosis D treated with <strong>2000 IU</strong> cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily for 6 mo per clinical practice. Plasma 25(OH)D, hepatic and metabolic panels, and metabolic syndrome components were assessed before and after cholecalciferol supplementation. Body composition was measured by using bioelectrical impedance analysis. The primary outcome measure was plasma 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/mL at the end of the study. Secondary outcomes included change in serum transaminases, fasting plasma glucose, and insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Chi-square, Student&rsquo;s t tests, correlation coefficient, and multivariate analysis were performed.</p><p>Results: Twenty-six (61.9%) patients had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 16 (38.1%) had hepatic steatosis. After 6 mo of cholecalciferol supplementation, plasma 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/mL was observed in 16 subjects (38.1%; responders) whereas the remaining 26 patients (61.9%) were nonresponders with plasma 25(OH)D &lt;30 ng/mL.</p><p>Significantly fewer (P &lt; 0.01) patients with NASH were responders (4 of 26, <strong>15.4%</strong> ) than those with hepatic steatosis (12 of 16, <strong>75%</strong> ). Baseline fasting serum alanine aminotransferase, plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR were similar in the responders and nonresponders, but the NASH score on the liver biopsy was lower (16.5%) in the responders (P &lt; 0.001). Nonresponders had a higher fat mass (10.5%) and lower fat-free mass (10.4%) than responders did. End-of-treatment alanine aminotransferase and HOMA-IR improved only in responders. The baseline HOMA-IR and histological NASH score were independent predictors of nonresponse to cholecalciferol supplementation.</p><p>Conclusions: Daily supplementation with 2000 IU cholecalciferol for 6 mo did not correct hypovitaminosis D in the majority of patients with NASH. Further studies are needed to determine if higher doses are effective. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as 13-00153.</p><p>PMID: 28814531 PMCID: PMC5610550 <span>[Available on 2018-10-01]</span> DOI: 10.3945/jn.117.254292</p><hr><h4 id=nearly-1-in-3-americans-have-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-and-there-are-no-symptoms---nov-2019>Nearly 1 in 3 Americans have Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and there are no symptoms - Nov 2019</h4><p><strong>NaturalHealth365</strong></p><p><strong>Recent Journal Articles</strong></p><ul><li><p>&ldquo;Fatty liver disease linked with Metabolic Syndrome&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;A fatty liver often goes hand-in-hand with Heart Disease&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Fatty liver disease is a risk factor for Dementia&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;A fatty liver imposes 91% higher risk for Cancer&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Fatty liver disease is associated with a higher risk of stroke&rdquo;</p></li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://stopfattyliver.com/?cookieUUID=71657dd0-3850-4e60-849a-99576b30b7d4">Dec 2019 Free Fatty Liver Class</a></strong></p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GETTING OFF THE LIVER TRANSPLANT LIST</td><td>Burt Berkson, MD, PhD</td></tr><tr><td>TURNING AROUND AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS</td><td>Jessica Miner</td></tr><tr><td>STOPPING CIRRHOSIS + LIVER FAILURE</td><td>Denise Otten, H.H.C.</td></tr><tr><td>LIVER STRESS SIGNALS + GALLBLADDER ALERT</td><td>Dr. Robert DeMaria</td></tr><tr><td>RESTORING LIVER HEALTH NATURALLY</td><td>Dr. Peter Osborne</td></tr><tr><td>BALANCING THE LIVER PROPERLY</td><td>Thomas Lewis, PhD</td></tr><tr><td>THE BIG LIVER HEALTH-DISEASE PICTURE</td><td>Carlos Garcia, MD</td></tr></tbody></table></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
