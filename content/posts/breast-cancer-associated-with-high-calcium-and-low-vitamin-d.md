Vitamin D and calcium are involved in a wide range of proliferation, apoptosis and cell signaling activities in the body.

Suboptimal concentrations may lead to cancer development. 

The role of phosphate in cancer metabolism is particularly relevant in breast cancer while, magnesium deficiency favors DNA mutations leading to carcinogenesis.

OBJECTIVES:

To determine serum levels of vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and parathormone in female breast cancer patients and to assess their association with some prognostic factors in breast cancer.

DESIGN AND METHODS:

This study is done on 98 newly diagnosed female breast cancer patients and 49 age matched apparently healthy female volunteers as controls. Serum samples from all patients and controls were subjected to 25-OH Vit D, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and parathormone measurements.

RESULTS:

In the breast cancer group, the median serum levels of 25-OH Vit D were 

* 15 ng/ml, while it was 

* 21 ng/ml in the control group. 

Levels of 25-OH Vit D and other tested minerals were significantly lower while 

* calcium:magnesium (Ca:Mg) ratio, and 

* calcium:phosphorus (Ca:P) ratio 

were significantly higher in the breast cancer group. 

Significant negative correlation was detected between phosphorus and calcium, ionized calcium , calcium magnesium ratio, and calcium phosphorus ratio.

CONCLUSION:

It is not only the deficient levels of Vit D and other related minerals, but the combination of the abnormal levels of all the studied parameters that might contribute to the development of cancer. Further studies with larger number of patient are needed.
