# 1 lb of solid is added to 5 lbs of water to make the lamb milk

## Thus the vitamin D in one pound of the lamb milk is 1/6 of 12,000 IU per pound = <span style="color:#F00;">2,000 IU per pound/pint of milk</span>

## Or 1,000 IU per cup

## Compare this to the vitamin D in fortified cow milk given to human infants: 100 IU per cup

# <span style="color:#F00;">Lambs get 10X more vitamin D in their milk formula</span>
