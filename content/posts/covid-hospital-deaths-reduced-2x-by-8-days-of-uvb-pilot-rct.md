#### Pilot Phase Results of a Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial of Narrowband Ultraviolet B Phototherapy in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients

Background: COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are driven by poor immune regulation. Narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy is standard of care in a number of immune-dysregulated diseases. To assess the efficacy of NB-UVB phototherapy for improving COVID-19 outcomes in high-risk, hospitalized, we developed the Adaptive Photo-Protection Trial. This is a multi-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The pilot phase results are reported here.

Experimental design: Consecutive patients admitted with a positive COVID-19 PCR were screened for eligibility. Enrolled subjects were computer randomized 1:1 to NB-UVB or placebo phototherapy. Subjects were treated daily with escalating doses on 27% of their body surface area for up to 8 consecutive days. Primary outcomes were safety and efficacy, defined as persistent or painful erythema and 28-day mortality. Comparisons were made via non-parametric exact tests.

Results: Patients in treatment (n=15) and placebo (n=15) arms had similar demographics. No adverse events occurred. 28-day mortality was 13.3% in treatment vs. 33.3% in placebo arms (p=0.39).

Conclusions: NB-UVB phototherapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was safe. Decreased mortality was observed in treated patients but this was statistically non-significant. Given its low-cost, scalability, and adjunctive nature, NB-UVB has the potential to improve COVID-19 outcomes. Continuation of this trial is warranted.

##### Possible reason: Vitamin D generated in skin ==> fortified immune system

UVB might have generated 10,000 IU daily

##### Possible reason: Virus killed by UVB ==> stop re-infection

[Ultraviolet light kills cold and flu viruses, and generates Vitamin D in the skin](/posts/ultraviolet-light-kills-cold-and-flu-viruses-and-generates-vitamin-d-in-the-skin)

##### Unlikely to be due to Nitric Oxide - as NO is generated by UVA, not UVB
