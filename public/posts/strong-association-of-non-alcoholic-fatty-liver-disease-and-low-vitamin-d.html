Recent years have witnessed a significant scientific interest on vitamin D and expanded its actions to include immune modulation, cell differentiation and proliferation and inflammation regulation. As our understanding of the many functions of vitamin D has grown, the presence of vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies worldwide. Concomitantly, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common form of chronic liver disease in western countries. NAFLD and vitamin D deficiency often coexist and epidemiologic evidence has shown that both of these conditions share several cardiometabolic risk factors. In this article we provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology linking NAFLD and vitamin D deficiency, as well as the available evidence on the clinical utility of vitamin D supplementation in NAFLD.</p><p>PMID: 25684936 <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fatty-liver.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=large-recent-increases-in-nafld---2014>Large recent increases in NAFLD - 2014</h4><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/lancet-liver-nov-2014.pdf>Download Lancet nov 2014 PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a></strong></p><p><strong><span style=color:red>8X increase in a decade</span></strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/nafld-increase-lancet.jpg alt=image><p><strong><a href=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2015/02/09/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-americas-greatest-health-risk-of-2015/%20>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Americaâ€™s Greatest Health Risk of 2015?</a> Scientific American</strong></p><ul><li>Today, up to 25 % of people in the U.S. are living with NAFLD</li></ul><hr><h4 id=fatty-livers-determined-by-ultasound-not-enzymes-had-lower-levels-of-vitamin-d---aug-2014>Fatty livers (determined by ultasound, not enzymes) had lower levels of vitamin D - Aug 2014</h4><p><strong>Serum vitamin D is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Chinese males with normal weight and liver enzymes</strong></p><p>Acta Pharmacologica Sinica , (4 August 2014) | doi:10.1038/aps.2014.48</p><p>Ya-ping Hao, Xiao-jing Ma, Yu-qi Luo, Jie Ni, Jian-xin Dou, Ya-qin Hu, Jia-an Zhu, Yu-qian Bao and Wei-ping Jia</p><p>Aim: Considering the characterization of vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor of ectopic fat deposition, the association of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3]</span> levels with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was evaluated in Chinese men with normal body mass index (BMI) and enzyme markers of liver function.</p><p>Methods: A total of 514 participants (22 to 79 years old) with normal BMI and liver enzymes were identified for analysis. <strong>Abdominal ultrasound was performed to diagnose NAFLD</strong> , and the fatty liver index (FLI) was calculated to quantify liver steatosis.

However, when serum 25(OH)D3 levels were compared between non-NAFLD subjects (n=438) and NAFLD subjects (n=76), the latter showed significantly lower levels ( <strong>15.65</strong> Â±5.89 ng/mL vs <strong>13.46</strong> Â±4.65 ng/mL, P=0.002). In addition, serum 25(OH)D3 levels were found to be significantly correlated with FLI after adjustment for age and BMI (r=âˆ’0.108, P=0.014). Logistic regression showed that serum 25(OH)D3 levels were independently correlated with NAFLD (OR: 0.937, 95% CI: 0.884â€“0.993, P=0.028).

Since vitamin D exerts significant metabolic activities, comprising free fatty acids (FFA) flux regulation from the periphery to the liver, its deficiency may promote fat deposition into the hepatocytes. Aim of our study was to test the hypothesis of a direct association between hypovitaminosis D and the presence of NAFLD in subjects with various degree of insulin-resistance and related metabolic disorders.</p><p>METHODS: We studied 262 consecutive subjects referred to the Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases clinics for metabolic evaluation. NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) was diagnosed by upper abdomen ultrasonography, metabolic syndrome was identified according to the Third Report of National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP/ATPIII) modified criteria. Insulin-resistance was evaluated by means of HOMA-IR. Fatty-Liver-Index, a recently identified correlate of NAFLD, was also estimated. Serum 25(OH)vitamin D was measured by colorimetric method.</p><p>RESULTS: Patients with NAFLD (n=162, 61.8%) had reduced serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels compared to subjects without NAFLD ( <strong>14.8</strong> +/- 9.2 vs <strong>20.5</strong> +/- 9.7 ng/ml, p&lt;0.001, <strong>OR 0.95</strong> , IC 95% 0.92-0.98).

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most extreme form of NAFLD this being regarded as a major cause of cirrhosis of the liver of unknown cause.</p><ul><li><p>The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ranges from 9 to 36.9% of the population in different parts of the world</p></li><li><p>Approximately 20% of the United States population suffers from non-alcoholic fatty liver, and the prevalence of this condition is increasing.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Symptoms and associations</strong></p><p><strong>Most patients with NAFLD have few or no symptoms.</strong></p><p>Patients may complain of fatigue, malaise, and dull right-upper-quadrant abdominal discomfort.</p><p>Mild jaundice may be noticed although this is rare.</p><p>More commonly NAFLD is diagnosed following abnormal liver function tests during routine blood tests.</p><p>By definition, alcohol consumption of over 20 g/day (about 25 ml/day) excludes the condition.</p><p>NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (obesity, combined hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (type II) and high blood pressure).</p><hr><h4 id=hypovitaminosis-d-is-associated-with-increased-whole-body-fat-mass-and-greater-severity-of-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease---2013>Hypovitaminosis D is associated with increased whole body fat mass and greater severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - 2013</h4><p>Liver Int. 2013 Sep 5. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.12312>doi: 10.1111/liv.12312</a></p><p>Dasarathy J, Periyalwar P, Allampati S, Bhinder V, Hawkins C, Brandt P, Khiyami A, McCullough AJ, Dasarathy S.</p><p>Department of Family Medicine, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.</p><p>BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hypovitaminosis D is common in obesity and insulin-resistant states. Increased fat mass in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may contribute to hypovitaminosis D. To determine the relation among plasma vitamin D concentration, severity of disease and body composition in NAFLD.</p><p>METHODS: Plasma vitamin D concentration was quantified in 148 consecutive biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis - NASH: n = 81; and hepatic steatosis: n = 67) and healthy controls (n = 39). NAFLD was scored using the NASH CRN criteria. Body composition was quantified by bioelectrical impedance analysis and abdominal CT image analysis.</p><p>RESULTS: Plasma vitamin D concentration was significantly lower in NAFLD ( <strong>21.2</strong> Â± 10.4 ng/ml) compared with healthy controls ( <strong>35.7</strong> Â± 6.0 ng/ml).</p><p>Higher NAFLD activity scores were associated with lower plasma concentration of vitamin D (r2 = 0.29; P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Subgroup analysis among patients with NAFLD showed that patients with NASH had significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) vitamin D levels than those with steatosis alone (18.1 Â± 8.4 vs. 25.0 Â± 11.3 ng/ml). Low concentrations of vitamin D were associated with greater severity of steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis (P &lt; 0.05).On multivariate regression analysis, only severity of hepatocyte ballooning was independently associated (P = 0.02) with low vitamin D concentrations.</p><p>Plasma vitamin D (P = 0.004) and insulin concentrations (P = 0.03) were independent predictors of the NAFLD activity score on biopsy.</p><p>Patients with NAFLD had higher fat mass that correlated with low vitamin D (r2 = 0.26; P = 0.008).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Low plasma vitamin D concentration is an independent predictor of the severity of NAFLD.</p><p>Further prospective studies demonstrating the impact of vitamin D replacement in NAFLD patients are required.</p><p>Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, an association between a low vitamin D level and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not yet been definitively established. This study aimed to characterize the relationship between a vitamin D level and NAFLD in Korea.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A cross-sectional study involving 6,055 health check-up subjects was conducted. NAFLD was diagnosed on the basis of typical ultrasonographic findings and a history of alcohol consumption.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>The subjects were aged 51.7Â±10.3 years (meanÂ±SD) and 54.7% were female. NAFLD showed a significant inverse correlation with the vitamin D level after adjusting for age and sex <span>[odds ratio (OR)=0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.75-0.96]</span>. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of NAFLD decreased steadily with increasing vitamin D level <a href="OR=0.74,%2095%25%20CI=0.60-0.90,%20lowest%20quintile%20(%E2%89%A414.4%20ng/mL)%20vs%20highest%20quintile%20(%E2%89%A528.9%20ng/mL),%20p%20for%20trend%20%3C0.001">OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.60-0.90, lowest quintile (â‰¤14.4 ng/mL) vs highest quintile (â‰¥28.9 ng/mL), p for trend &lt;0.001</a>. Multivariate regression analysis after adjusting for other metabolic factors revealed that NAFLD showed a significant inverse correlation with both the vitamin D level (>20 ng/mL) <span>[OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.75-0.99]</span> and the quintiles of the vitamin D level in a dose-dependent manner (p for trend=0.001).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>The serum level of vitamin D, even when within the normal range, was found to be inversely correlated with NAFLD in a dose-dependent manner. Vitamin D was found to be inversely correlated with NAFLD independent of known metabolic risk factors. These findings suggest that vitamin D exerts protective effects against NAFLD.</p><p>PMID: 27044765</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/fatty-liver-2016.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=2000-iu-daily-did-not-improve-nafld-no-surprise--june-2016>2,000 IU daily did not improve NAFLD (no surprise)- June 2016</h4><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27353492?dopt=Abstract">No effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</a></p><ol><li><p>Too small of a dose (raised average Vitamin D level to 36 nanograms)</p></li><li><p>Wrong form of vitamin D for a poor liver</p></li></ol><hr><h4 id=many-vitamins-are-associated-with-nafld-not-just-vitamin-d---review-sept-2021>Many vitamins are associated with NAFLD, not just Vitamin D - Review Sept 2021</h4><p><strong>The Role of Vitamins in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamins-and-nafld.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1749775589"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1749775589",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1749775589"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1749775589"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1749775589"></script></body></html>
