&lt;p>BACKGROUND:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Women&amp;rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trial (RCT) of calcium plus vitamin D (CaD) supplements found a 17% excess in urinary tract stone incidence in the supplemented group. This study evaluated whether this risk is modified by participant characteristics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kidney stones Vitamin D myth from medical book - 2010</title><link>/posts/kidney-stones-vitamin-d-myth-from-medical-book-2010.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/kidney-stones-vitamin-d-myth-from-medical-book-2010.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="chapter-1-vitamin-d-and-health-by-michael-f-holick">Chapter 1: Vitamin D and Health, by Michael F.

&lt;h4 id="52-myth-treatment-with-vitamin-d-will-increase-risk-of-kidney-stones">5.2. (Myth) Treatment with Vitamin D Will Increase Risk of Kidney Stones&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Although there are some published studies that have suggested that increasing calcium and vitamin D will increase the risk of kidney stones, these studies were not well controlled for either calcium or vitamin D intake and other causes of kidney stone development were not evaluated (75). The major cause for kidney stones is the increased absorption of dietary oxalate that is often present in dark green leafy vegetables including spinach. This is the reason why it has been observed that increasing calcium intake reduces risk of developing kidney stones. However, patients who have a history of kidney stones do need to be cautious about their calcium intake. For patients with kidney stones who are not getting an adequate amount of calcium in their diet and need to take a calcium supplement, I recommend either calcium citrate or calcium citrate malate. The reason is that the &lt;strong>citrate and malate will chelate the calcium in the urine decreasing risk of kidney stone development&lt;/strong> . Treating vitamin D de?ciency and increasing vitamin D intake to raise blood levels of 25(OH)D of &amp;gt;30 and &amp;lt;100 ng/ml will not increase the risk of developing kidney stones unless there is some other underlying calcium or bone metabolic disorder (4).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
