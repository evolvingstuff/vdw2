Vitamin D deficiency remains common among pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) despite both aggressive and standard of care strategies. This study examined the safety and efficacy of single high-dose oral vitamin D therapy (Stoss therapy) for treatment of vitamin D deficiency in HSCT recipients. Patients ages 1-21 years presenting for HSCT were randomized to receive either Stoss regimen plus weekly/daily supplementation or standard of care, per US Endocrine Society guidelines. Among the total 48 subjects, 22 (46%) were randomized to Stoss and 26 (54%) to control arms. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels were insufficient/deficient in total of 34 (71%) patients, without difference between treatment groups. The Stoss regimen was well tolerated and no toxicity was observed. At Day +30, mean 25-OHD levels were significantly higher (P = 0.04) with Stoss ( **42.3**  ± 12 μg/l) compared to controls ( **35.6**  ± 14.3 μg/l), and a higher proportion of Stoss patients had adequate vitamin D levels than controls (85% vs 65%). Stoss therapy is a safe and efficacious treatment option for vitamin D deficiency in children undergoing HSCT and may achieve sufficient levels more rapidly than standard of care.
