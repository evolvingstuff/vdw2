#### Wonder how many of the following paths support the premis that Pollution ==> poor health

Pollution reduces UV which reduces Vitamin D

Pollution reduces desire to go outdoors, which reduces Vitamin D

Pollution is associated with high temperatures, which reduces desire to go outdoors, which reduces vitamin D

Diesel pollution reduces liver functionality which reduces Omega-3

Low Omega-3 reduces vitamin D getting to cells (way downstream from the blodd test indication of vitamin D level)

Diesel pollution reduces liver functionality which reduces Vitamin D

 **Highlights** 

• Low-dose DE enhances impact of n-3 deficient diet intake on the liver.

• DE inhalation enhances up-regulation of genes for hepatic lipid synthesis.

• Combination of DE inhalation and n-3 deficient diet intake increases risk for incidence of fatty liver disease.

Exposure to  **diesel exhaust (DE) exacerbates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** , and may systemically affect lipid metabolism. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) have anti-inflammatory activity and suppresses hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation, but many daily diets are deficient in this nutrient. Therefore, the effect of DE exposure in mice fed n-3 PUFA–deficient diet was investigated. Mice were fed control chow or n-3 PUFA–deficient diet for 4 weeks, then exposed to clean air or DE by inhalation for further 4 weeks. Liver histology, plasma parameters, and expression of fatty acid synthesis-related genes were evaluated. N-3 PUFA–deficient diet increased hepatic lipid droplets accumulation and expression of genes promoting fatty acid synthesis: Acaca, Acacb, and Scd1. DE further increased the plasma leptin and the expression of fatty acid synthesis-related genes: Acacb, Fasn, and Scd1. N-3 PUFA–deficient diet and DE exposure potentially enhanced hepatic fatty acid synthesis and subsequently accumulation of lipid droplets. The combination of low-dose DE exposure and intake of n-3 PUFA–deficient diet may be an additional risk factor for the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The present study suggests an important mechanism for preventing toxicity of DE on the liver through the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs in the diet.
