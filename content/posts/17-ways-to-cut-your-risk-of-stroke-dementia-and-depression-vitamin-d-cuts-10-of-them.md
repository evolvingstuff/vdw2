##### 17 Ways to Cut Your Risk of Stroke, Dementia, and Depression All at Once: [Perplexity AI, April 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/please-describe-17-ways-to-cut-43ZXHatVST.K1IqkJrJqWg)

Recent research has identified 17 modifiable risk factors that overlap in their influence on stroke, dementia, and late-life depression. Addressing these factors can significantly reduce your risk for all three conditions, as they share underlying mechanisms-primarily damage to the brainâ€™s small blood vessels-that link them together [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

###### The 17 Modifiable Risk Factors

The following table summarizes the 17 risk and protective factors identified by the research:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Risk/Protective Factor | Effect on Brain Health |
| High blood pressure | Increases risk |
| High body mass index (BMI) | Increases risk |
| Kidney disease | Increases risk |
| High blood glucose | Increases risk |
| High cholesterol | Increases risk |
| Alcohol consumption | Increases risk |
| Poor dietary habits | Increases risk |
| Hearing loss | Increases risk |
| Chronic pain | Increases risk |
| Physical inactivity | Increases risk |
| Lack of purpose in life | Increases risk |
| Poor sleep quality | Increases risk |
| Smoking | Increases risk |
| Social isolation | Increases risk |
| High stress | Increases risk |
| Low cognitive engagement | Increases risk |
| Symptoms of depression | Increases risk |

Each factor is associated with at least two of the three conditions, and many are interconnected [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

###### 17 Key Strategies to Lower Your Risk

 **1. Manage Blood Pressure** 

High blood pressure is the most significant individual risk factor, nearly tripling the risk of stroke and substantially increasing the risk of dementia and depression. Strategies include reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, losing weight, and, if necessary, taking prescribed medication [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **2. Improve Physical Activity** 

Moderate to high levels of physical activity-such as brisk walking, gardening, running, or swimming-substantially decrease the risk of both stroke and dementia, and also help with depression [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression).

 **3. Maintain a Healthy Diet** 

A balanced diet helps control weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol, all of which are risk factors. Reducing alcohol intake and avoiding excessive refined carbohydrates and sugars are also beneficial [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **4. Quit Smoking** 

Smoking is a major risk factor for all three conditions. Quitting can have immediate and long-term benefits for brain health [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **5. Control Blood Sugar and Cholesterol** 

Managing diabetes and high cholesterol through diet, exercise, and medication (if needed) reduces risk [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **6. Ensure Good Sleep** 

Aim for at least seven hours of quality sleep per night. Good sleep hygiene supports brain health and mood regulation [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **7. Stay Socially Connected** 

Maintaining a robust social network reduces the risk of dementia, stroke, and depression [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html).

 **8. Engage in Cognitive Activities** 

Regularly challenging your brain-through puzzles, reading, or learning new skills-can lower dementia risk by about 40% [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression).

 **9. Address Hearing Loss** 

Treating hearing impairment can help prevent cognitive decline and depression [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **10. Manage Chronic Pain** 

Effectively treating chronic pain can lower the risk of depression and cognitive decline [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression).

 **11. Reduce Stress** 

Managing stress through mindfulness, therapy, or relaxation techniques is protective for brain health [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression).

 **12. Find Purpose in Life** 

A strong sense of purpose is associated with lower risk of depression and dementia [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression).

 **13. Monitor and Support Kidney Health** 

Severe kidney disease is a significant risk factor for all three conditions [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **14. Limit Alcohol Consumption** 

Reducing alcohol intake lowers the risk of both dementia and stroke [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **15. Maintain a Healthy Weight** 

Keeping BMI in a healthy range helps control other risk factors like blood pressure and diabetes [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

 **16. Address Symptoms of Depression Early** 

Early intervention for depression can prevent progression and lower risk of related brain diseases [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression).

 **17. Regular Medical Checkups** 

Routine health visits help monitor and manage these risk factors, including those that may not be obvious, like high blood pressure or hearing loss [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

##### Practical Approach

Experts recommend not trying to perfect all 17 factors at once. Instead, view them as a menu-choose a few to focus on, and remember that progress in one area often benefits others (for example, increased physical activity can improve sleep, lower blood pressure, and reduce stress) [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).

"When you begin to focus on one of these factors, you're frequently improving multiple aspects simultaneously. That's an excellent approach to take." - Dr. Sanjula Singh [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html)

##### Bottom Line

By targeting these 17 modifiable factors, you can make meaningful strides in preventing or delaying stroke, dementia, and late-life depression. Even small, consistent changes can have a significant impact on your long-term brain health [1](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/well/dementia-stroke-depression-prevention.html) [2](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/health/dementia-depression-stroke-17-risk-factors-wellness/index.html) [3](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/modifiable-risk-factors-for-stroke-dementia-depression) [4](https://www.health.com/study-17-risk-factors-dementia-depression-stroke-11712995).
