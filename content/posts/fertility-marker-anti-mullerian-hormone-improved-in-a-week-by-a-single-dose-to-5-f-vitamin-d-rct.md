Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a paracrine regulator of ovarian follicles. Vitamin D (Vit D) regulates AMH production in vitro, but its role as a regulator of ovarian AMH production is contentious. If Vit D influences ovarian AMH production, then an acute rise in Vit D level should lead to an acute rise in circulating AMH levels. This hypothesis was tested with a randomized double-blind design, with 18–25-year-old women recruited from the community. The study was conducted in early spring, when the marker of Vit D level (25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D) tends to be at its nadir. The women consumed either an oral dose of 50,000 IU of Vit D3 (n = 27) or placebo (n = 22). The initial 25(OH)D ± SD value was 53.6 ± 23.3 nmol/L, with 42 of the 49 women having a value below 75 nmol/L, consistent with seasonal nadir. 

All women receiving Vit D3 treatment exhibited a robust increase in serum 25(OH)D within 1 day (15.8 ± 1.1 nmol/L (n = 27), p < 0.0001), with the increase sustained over the study week. Circulating levels of AMH in the women receiving Vit D3 progressively rose during the following week, with a mean increase of 12.9 ± 3.7% (n = 24, p = 0.001). The study supports the hypothesis that Vit D’s positive effects on the fertility of woman may involve the regulation of ovarian AMH levels.

#### The role of anti-Müllerian hormone in female fertility and infertility - an overview 2012

Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2012 Nov;91(11):1252-60. [doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01471.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01471.x.)

Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) plasma levels reflect the continuous non-cyclic growth of small follicles, thereby mirroring the size of the resting primordial follicle pool and thus acting as a useful marker of ovarian reserve. 

 **Anti-Müllerian hormone seems to be the best endocrine marker for assessing the age-related decline of the ovarian pool in healthy women; thus, it has a potential ability to predict future reproductive lifespan.** The most established role for AMH measurements is before in vitro fertilization is initiated, because AMH can be predictive of the ovarian response, namely poor and hyper-responses. 

However, recent research has also highlighted the use of AMH in a variety of ovarian pathological conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome, granulosa cell tumors and premature ovarian failure. A new commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring AMH levels has been developed, making results from different studies more comparable. Nevertheless, widespread clinical application awaits an international standard for AMH, so that results using future assays can be reliably compared.
