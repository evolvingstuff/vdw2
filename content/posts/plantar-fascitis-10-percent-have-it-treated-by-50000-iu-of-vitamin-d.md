This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding the role of vitamin D3 in chronic plantar fasciitis. The pleiotropic effects of vitamin D3 in modulating inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues are highlighted. Evidence suggests that vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and upregulating anti-inflammatory mediators, which may be particularly beneficial in the context of chronic plantar fasciitis. Additionally, vitamin D3 has been found to enhance the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen synthesis, essential for the repair and regeneration of the plantar fascia. Intervention studies have demonstrated that individuals with chronic plantar fasciitis often exhibit lower serum vitamin D levels compared to healthy controls, and supplementation with vitamin D3 can lead to significant improvements in pain, physical function, and quality of life. The findings also suggest a potential association between vitamin D3 status and the development of chronic plantar fasciitis. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the existing literature, as many of the studies to date have been observational in nature, and the causal relationship between vitamin D3 status and the development or progression of plantar fasciitis remains to be fully elucidated.

Interventional studies have also provided insights into the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin D supplementation in chronic plantar fasciitis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo­controlled trial by Jansen., et al. demonstrated that supplementation with  **50,000 IU of vitamin D3 per week for 8 weeks led to significant improvements**  in pain, function, and quality of life in patients with chronic plantar fasciitis, compared to the placebo group <sup>[16]</sup>.

This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing literature regarding the role of vitamin D3 in chronic plantar fasciitis. The pleiotropic effects of vitamin D3 in modulating inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues are highlighted. Evidence suggests that vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and upregulating anti-inflammatory mediators, which may be particularly beneficial in the context of chronic plantar fasciitis. Additionally, vitamin D3 has been found to enhance the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and collagen synthesis, essential for the repair and regeneration of the plantar fascia. Intervention studies have demonstrated that individuals with chronic plantar fasciitis often exhibit lower serum vitamin D levels compared to healthy controls, and supplementation with vitamin D3 can lead to significant improvements in pain, physical function, and quality of life. The findings also suggest a potential association between vitamin D3 status and the development of chronic plantar fasciitis. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the existing literature, as many of the studies to date have been observational in nature, and the causal relationship between vitamin D3 status and the development or progression of plantar fasciitis remains to be fully elucidated.
