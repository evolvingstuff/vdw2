The hormonally active form of vitamin D(3), 1?,25(OH)(2)-Vitamin D(3), acts in intestine, its major target tissue, where its actions are of regulatory and developmental importance: regulation of intracellular calcium through modulation of second messengers and activation of mitogenic cascades leading to cell proliferation. 

Several causes have been  **postulated**  to modify the hormone response in intestinal cells with ageing, among them, 

* alterations of Vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels and binding sites, 

* reduced expression of G-proteins and 

* hormone signal transduction changes. 

The current review summarizes the actual knowledge regarding the molecular and biochemical basis of age-impaired 1?,25(OH)(2)-Vitamin D(3) receptor-mediated signaling in intestinal cells. A fundamental understanding why the hormone functions are impaired with age will enhance our knowlegde of its importance in intestinal cell physiology.
