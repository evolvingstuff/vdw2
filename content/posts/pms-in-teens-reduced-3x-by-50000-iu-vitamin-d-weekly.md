Vitamin D has a crucial role in female reproduction, possibly through its effects on calcium homeostasis, cyclic sex steroid hormone fluctuations, or neurotransmitter function. We have assessed the effects of vitamin D supplementation on dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in adolescents. In this study, 897 adolescent girls living in Mashhad and Sabzevar, Iran, received 9 high-dose vitamin D supplements (as 50000 IU/ week of cholecalciferol) and were followed up over 9 weeks. We evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on individuals in 4 categories: those with only PMS; individuals with only dysmenorrhea; subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea and normal subjects. 

The prevalence of PMS after the intervention fell from  **14.9% to 4.8%**  (P<0.001). 

Similar results were also found for the prevalence of subjects with  **dysmenorrhea (35.9% reduced to 32.4%)** , and in subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea (32.7% reduced 25.7%). Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in the incidence of several symptoms of PMS such as backache and tendency to cry easily as well decrement in pain severity of dysmenorrhea (P<0.05). High dose vitamin D supplementation can reduced the prevalence of PMS and dysmenorrhea as well has positive effects on the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS.
