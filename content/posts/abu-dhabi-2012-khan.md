## Metrological Traceability Key to Standardization & Harmonization of Vitamin D

True and precise routine measurements of Vitamin D quantities are essential if results are to be optimally interpreted for patient care. Additionally, analytical results produced by different measurement procedures for Vitamin D must be comparable if common diagnostic decision values and clinical research findings are to be broadly applied and clinical practice guidelines are implemented for clinical governance. 

Metrology, the science of measurement, provides laboratory medicine with a structured approach to the Vitamin D development and terminology of reference measurement systems which, when implemented, improve the accuracy and comparability of patients’ results. The metrological approach is underpinned by the concepts of common measurement units, traceability of measured values, measurement uncertainty and commutability as seen with the development of the Vitamin D Standard Reference Materials 971 & 2972 by the CDC and the LC MS/MS Reference Measurement Procedure developed by the NIST. Before the advent of the above mentioned reference systems-traceability to the International System of Units (SI units) was not yet realized for " Measurand i.e.: Vitamin D", hitherto results comparability achieved was by other, lower order standard approaches, hence the high dispersion of Vitamin D results with little Harmonization. 

Vitamin D Measurements are at the core in health care management of skeletal disorders and nutritional review status of population. Scientists and Pathologists should ensure that patients’ results are traceable to the highest available reference standard material and methods. This lecture on Vitamin D, introduces and illustrates the principles of metrological traceability, describes its critical importance to improving the quality of patients’ results as recommended by the Institute of Medicine. The presentation will also review current scientific analytical highlights that need to be considered to actively promote traceability and accuracy in clinical laboratories. Participation in the Proficiency Testing through the DEQAS-UK and the College of American Pathologists (PT and Accuracy Testing Surveys) is highly recommended.
