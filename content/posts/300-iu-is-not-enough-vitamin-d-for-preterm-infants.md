### Vitamin D status of early preterm infants and the effects of vitamin D intake during hospital stay.

Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed. 2014 Mar;99(2):F166-8. [doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303999.](https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2013-303999.) Epub 2013 Jul 13.

OBJECTIVES:

To evaluate vitamin D (vitD) status in early preterm infants (EPTIs) at birth and during birth hospitalisation on current vitD intake.

DESIGN/METHODS:

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations, vitD intake and risk factors for low vitD status were assessed in 120 infants born at ≤32 weeks gestation.

RESULTS:

Mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D at birth was 46.2 (14.0) nmol/L with lower concentrations in infants born <28 weeks than at 28-32 weeks gestation, p=0.02. Serum 25(OH)D was <50 nmol/L in 63% of mothers, 64% of infants at birth and 35% of infants at discharge. 

Mean daily vitD intake was  **289±96 IU**  at 4 weeks of age and 60% achieved 400 IU/day intake at discharge.

CONCLUSIONS:

Serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L was widespread in parturient women and in EPTIs at birth and at discharge. Optimising maternal vitD status during pregnancy and improving postnatal vitD intake may enhance infant vitD status during hospitalisation.
