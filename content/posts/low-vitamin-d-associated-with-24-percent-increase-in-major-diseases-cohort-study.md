From the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.

Background: Circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25-(OH)D]</span> are used to define vitamin D deficiency. Current clinical 25-(OH)D targets based on associations with intermediate markers of bone metabolism may not reflect optimal levels for other chronic diseases and do not account for known seasonal variation in 25-(OH)D concentration.

Objective: To evaluate the relationship of 25-(OH)D concentration with the incidence of major clinical disease events that are pathophysiologically relevant to vitamin D.

Design: Cohort study.

Setting: The Cardiovascular Health Study conducted in 4 U.S. communities. Data from 1992 to 2006 were included in this analysis.

Participants: 1621 white older adults.

Measurements: Serum 25-(OH)D concentration (using a high-performance liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry assay that conforms to National Institute of Standards and Technology reference standards) and associations with time to a composite outcome of incident hip fracture, myocardial infarction, cancer, or death.

Results: Over a median 11-year follow-up, the composite outcome occurred in 1018 participants (63%). Defining events included 

* 137 hip fractures, 

* 186 myocardial infarctions, 

* 335 incidences of cancer, and 3

* 60 deaths. 

The association of low 25-(OH)D concentration with risk for the composite outcome varied by season (P = 0.057). A concentration lower than a season-specific Z score of ?0.54 best discriminated risk for the composite outcome and was associated with a  **24% higher risk**  in adjusted analyses (95% CI, 9% to 42%). 

Corresponding season-specific 25-(OH)D concentrations were 43, 50, 61, and 55 nmol/L (17, 20, 24, and 22 ng/mL) in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively.

Limitation: The observational study was restricted to white participants.

Conclusion: Threshold concentrations of 25-(OH)D associated with increased risk for relevant clinical disease events center near 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL). Season-specific targets for 25-(OH)D concentration may be more appropriate than static targets when evaluating health risk.
