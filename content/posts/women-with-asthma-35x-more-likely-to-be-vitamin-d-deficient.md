SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Poster

PURPOSE: A case - control study to investigate the correlation between vitamin A & D serum levels and asthma in women in northern Jordan

METHODS: A total of 145 women, 68 asthmatics, age range between 19 to 65 years (mean of 41), and 77 healthy subjects, age range between 19 to 51 years (mean of 30.7) were enrolled. Cases with recent asthma exacerbation, diseases affect vitamin-D or history of smoking were excluded. Asthma severity was classified using Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines and Asthma Control Test (ACT). Non-asthmatic control group, were screened for asthma symptoms using asthma Life Quality (LQ) test questionnaire and had a normal flow spirometry. Serum levels of vitamins A and D were measured using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed using independent sample t- test.

RESULTS: The mean (SD) of 25(OH)-D serum level was significantly lower (p = 0.027) in asthma group (mean (SD) = 8.3 (3.2) ng/ml) compared to control group (mean (SD) =10.5 (7.6) ng/ml). Prevalence of vitamin-D deficiency (&lt;15 ng/ml) was higher in asthma group (p-value = 0.070). After adjusting for age, the odds of having vitamin-D deficiency for patients with asthma were  **35.8**  times higher than the odds for women with no asthma. 25(OH)-D levels were significantly inversely related to number of treatments required to control asthma (r = -0.24, p-value = 0.045). Correlation between 25(OH)-D levels and ACT scores was not statistically significant (P-value = 0.053)

CONCLUSIONS: Asthma patients have more vitamin D deficiency, and deficiency level correlated with number of treatments required to control asthma. 

This difference might indicate a possible causative-effect relationship of vitamin D deficiency on Asthma phenotype

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Further study for a possible therapeutic effect of vitamin D supplement on Asthma control and severity might be needed.
