When reviewing the studies with a “safety first” perspective “many maternal side effects were greater in the RSVpreF group, with an increased incidence of 

* local reactions (RR, 5.98 <span>[3.68, 6.83]</span>; P=0.01; I2=0%), 

* joint pain (RR, 1.60, 1.39 <span>[0.68, 2.86]</span>; P=0.37; I2=59%), 

* cardiac disorders (RR, 1.19 <span>[0.80, 1.77]</span>; P=0.38; I2=0%), 

* blood disorders (RR, 1.07 <span>[0.69, 1.66]</span>; P=0.78; I2=0%), 

* fatigue (RR, 1.05 <span>[1.00, 1.10]</span>; P=0.07; I2=0%), 

* headache (RR, 0.80 <span>[0.30, 2.10]</span>; P=0.65; I2=0%), 

* fever (RR, 0.90 <span>[0.20, 4.16]</span>; P=0.89; I2=57%), 

* gastrointestinal disorders (RR, 1.04 <span>[0.70, 1.56]</span>; P=0.83; I2=0%), and 

* pregnancy complications (RR, 1.01 <span>[0.65, 1.56]</span>; P=0.97; I2=17%).”
