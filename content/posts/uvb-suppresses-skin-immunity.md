UVB radiation is a potent environmental carcinogen that not only causes mutations in the skin but also profoundly suppresses skin immune responses. Although this UVB-induced suppression of antitumor immunity has a key role in skin cancer development, the wavelengths within UVB causing greatest in vivo immunosuppression in humans are as yet unknown. We have identified a wavelength dependency for immunosuppression in humans across the UVB spectrum. We established linear dose-response curves for UV-induced local suppression of recall contact hypersensitivity responses at four wavelengths between 289 and 322 nm and found <font style="background:rgb(204,255,204) none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">peak immune suppressive effectiveness at 300 nm</font> and no detectable suppression at 322 nm within a physiologically relevant dose range.
