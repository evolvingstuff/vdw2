* NAFLD also affects up to 9.6% of American children aged 2 to 19, making it as common as asthma. In 15- to 19-year-olds, prevalence is as high as 17.3%. Prevalence among children 0 to 17 has risen 168.3% since 2017, with a particularly precipitous rise starting in 2020"

* "The dramatic rise in NAFLD in early 2020 may in part be due to the COVID lockdowns, which had the effect of raising childhood obesity rates by 8.3% to 13.4%, depending on the age group"

#### NAFLD is treated by Vitamin D, Omega-3, etc. Aug 2023

 **NAFLD and nutraceuticals: a review of completed phase III and IV clinical trials** 

Front Med (Lausanne) . 2023 Aug 1;10:1227046. [doi: 10.3389/fmed.2023.1227046](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2023.1227046)

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="300">

Background: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has become a significant public health concern, affecting approximately one-fourth of the population. Despite its prevalence, no FDA-approved drug treatments specifically target NAFLD.

Aim: To provide a review of clinical trials investigating the use of herbal remedies and dietary supplements in NAFLD management, utilizing the ClinicalTrials.gov database.

Methods: This review evaluates the current evidence by examining completed phase III and IV clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. An exhaustive search was performed on April 17, 2023, using the terms "Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease" and "NAFLD." Two independent reviewers appraised eligible trials based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results: An initial search yielded 1,226 clinical trials, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria after filtration. 

The majority of trials focused on 

* Omega-3 fatty acids (20.0%) and 

* vitamin D (26.7%), 

followed by caffeine, chlorogenic acid, ginger, phosphatidylcholine, Trigonella Foenum-graecum seed extract, vitamin C, and vitamin E (each 6.7%). Most studies were Phase 3 (75.0%) and used a parallel assignment model (91.7%). Quadruple masking was the most prevalent technique (58.3%), and Iran was the leading country in terms of trial locations (25.0%). These interventions constitute two herbal interventions and nine supplement interventions.

Conclusion: This reveals a diverse range of nutraceuticals, with Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D being predominant in the management of NAFLD. The global distribution of trials highlights the widespread interest in these therapeutics. However, more rigorous, large-scale trials are needed to establish safety, efficacy, and optimal dosages.

#### NAFLD helped a bit by a single 300,000 IU Vitamin D dose (needed larger maintenance doses) – RCT March 2023

 **The effect of high oral loading dose of cholecalciferol in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients. A randomized placebo controlled trial** 

Front Pharmacol . 2023 Mar 14;14:1149967. [doi: 10.3389/fphar.2023.1149967.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2023.1149967.) eCollection 2023.

Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) is one of the most common progressive metabolic disorders worldwide. There are increasing scientific interests nowadays for the association between vitamin D status and Non-alcoholic fatty liver. Earlier studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients that contributes to poor outcomes. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral cholecalciferol on Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients. 

Subjects and Methods: This study was conducted on 140 patients that were randomized either to group 1 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to placebo or group 2 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to cholecalciferol during the 4 months study period. 

Results: At the end of the study group 2 revealed significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the mean serum level of TG, LDL-C, TC, hsCRP as compared to their baseline results and group 1 results. Additionally, a significant improvement in the serum levels of ALT (p = 0.001) was seen in group 2 at the end of the study when compared to group 1. Whereas group 1 did not show any change in these parameters when compared to group 2 and their baseline results. 

Conclusion: Cholecalciferol was shown to have beneficial effects on serum ALT levels, hsCRP levels and lipid profile of NAFLD patients. Clinical Trial Registration: https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/prs-users-guide.html, identifier NCT05613192.

#### NAFLD might be fought by D if the Vitamin D receptor is activated - Sept 2023

 **Insights into the role of vitamin D in targeting the culprits of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease** 

Life Sci. 2023 Sep 22;122124. [doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122124](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2023.122124) PDF is behind a paywall

Vitamin D (VD) is a secosteroid hormone that is renowned for its crucial role in phospho-calcium homeostasis upon binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). Over and above, the pleiotropic immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic roles VD plays in different disease settings started to surface in the past few decades. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence suggests a correlation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive inflammatory form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with vitamin D deficiency (VDD) owing to the former's ingrained link with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Accordingly, a better understanding of the contribution of VDR signalling to NAFLD incidence and progression would provide further insights into its diagnosis, treatment modalities, and prognosis, especially since hitherto, no drug for NAFLD has been approved. This review, therefore, sought to set forth the likely contribution of VDR signalling in NAFLD and how it might influence its multiple drivers.

There are increasing scientific interests nowadays for the association between vitamin D status and Non-alcoholic fatty liver. Earlier studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients that contributes to poor outcomes. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral cholecalciferol on Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients. \n\nSubjects and Methods: This study was conducted on 140 patients that were randomized either to group 1 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to placebo or group 2 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to cholecalciferol during the 4 months study period. \n\nResults: At the end of the study group 2 revealed significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in the mean serum level of TG, LDL-C, TC, hsCRP as compared to their baseline results and group 1 results. Additionally, a significant improvement in the serum levels of ALT (p = 0.001) was seen in group 2 at the end of the study when compared to group 1. Whereas group 1 did not show any change in these parameters when compared to group 2 and their baseline results. \n\nConclusion: Cholecalciferol was shown to have beneficial effects on serum ALT levels, hsCRP levels and lipid profile of NAFLD patients.

*NAFLD also affects up to 9.6% of American children aged 2 to 19, making it as common as asthma. In 15- to 19-year-olds, prevalence is as high as 17.3%. Prevalence among children 0 to 17 has risen 168.3% since 2017, with a particularly precipitous rise starting in 2020&quot;
*&quot;The dramatic rise in NAFLD in early 2020 may in part be due to the COVID lockdowns, which had the effect of raising childhood obesity rates by 8.3% to 13.4%, depending on the age group&quot;

Background: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has become a significant public health concern, affecting approximately one-fourth of the population. Despite its prevalence, no FDA-approved drug treatments specifically target NAFLD.

Aim: To provide a review of clinical trials investigating the use of herbal remedies and dietary supplements in NAFLD management, utilizing the ClinicalTrials.gov database.

Methods: This review evaluates the current evidence by examining completed phase III and IV clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. An exhaustive search was performed on April 17, 2023, using the terms &quot;Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease&quot; and &quot;NAFLD.&quot; Two independent reviewers appraised eligible trials based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results: An initial search yielded 1,226 clinical trials, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria after filtration. 
The majority of trials focused on 
*Omega-3 fatty acids (20.0%) and 
*vitamin D (26.7%), 
followed by caffeine, chlorogenic acid, ginger, phosphatidylcholine, Trigonella Foenum-graecum seed extract, vitamin C, and vitamin E (each 6.7%). Most studies were Phase 3 (75.0%) and used a parallel assignment model (91.7%). Quadruple masking was the most prevalent technique (58.3%), and Iran was the leading country in terms of trial locations (25.0%). These interventions constitute two herbal interventions and nine supplement interventions.

Conclusion: This reveals a diverse range of nutraceuticals, with Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D being predominant in the management of NAFLD. The global distribution of trials highlights the widespread interest in these therapeutics. However, more rigorous, large-scale trials are needed to establish safety, efficacy, and optimal dosages.

Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) is one of the most common progressive metabolic disorders worldwide. There are increasing scientific interests nowadays for the association between vitamin D status and Non-alcoholic fatty liver. Earlier studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients that contributes to poor outcomes. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral cholecalciferol on Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients. 

Subjects and Methods: This study was conducted on 140 patients that were randomized either to group 1 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to placebo or group 2 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to cholecalciferol during the 4 months study period. 

Results: At the end of the study group 2 revealed significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in the mean serum level of TG, LDL-C, TC, hsCRP as compared to their baseline results and group 1 results. Additionally, a significant improvement in the serum levels of ALT (p = 0.001) was seen in group 2 at the end of the study when compared to group 1. Whereas group 1 did not show any change in these parameters when compared to group 2 and their baseline results. 

Conclusion: Cholecalciferol was shown to have beneficial effects on serum ALT levels, hsCRP levels and lipid profile of NAFLD patients. Clinical Trial Registration: https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/prs-users-guide.html, identifier NCT05613192.

Vitamin D (VD) is a secosteroid hormone that is renowned for its crucial role in phospho-calcium homeostasis upon binding to the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR). Over and above, the pleiotropic immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic roles VD plays in different disease settings started to surface in the past few decades. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence suggests a correlation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive inflammatory form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with vitamin D deficiency (VDD) owing to the former&#39;s ingrained link with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Accordingly, a better understanding of the contribution of VDR signalling to NAFLD incidence and progression would provide further insights into its diagnosis, treatment modalities, and prognosis, especially since hitherto, no drug for NAFLD has been approved. This review, therefore, sought to set forth the likely contribution of VDR signalling in NAFLD and how it might influence its multiple drivers.
