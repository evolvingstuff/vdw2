BACKGROUND:

Suboptimal vitamin D status is prevalent in HIV-infected patients and associated with increased risk of disease severity and morbidity. We aimed to determine 12-mo safety and efficacy of daily 7000IU vitamin D3 (vitD3) vs placebo to sustain increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and improve immune status in HIV-infected subjects.

METHODS:

This was a double-blind trial of perinatally- (PHIV) or behaviorally-acquired (BHIV) HIV-infected subjects (5.0-24.9y). Safety, 25(OH)D-related parameters, and immune status were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.

RESULTS:

Fifty-eight subjects enrolled (67% male, 85% African-American, 64% BHIV) and 50 completed with no safety concerns. In unadjusted analyses, there were no differences between randomization groups at baseline; at 3, 6, and 12 months, 25(OH)D was higher with supplementation than baseline and higher than with placebo (P<0.05). 

In adjusted mixed models, in the supplementation group, the fixed effect of 25(OH)D was higher (P<0.001). 

* Percentage of naïve T helper cells (Th naïve%) were significantly (P<0.01) and 

* T helper cells (CD4%) marginally (P<0.10) increased 

with supplementation in those taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and RNA viral load was reduced (P≤0.05). In exploratory linear models, change in 25(OH)D predicted RNA viral load at 3 and 12 months and CD4% at 3 months (P<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:

Daily 7000IU vitD3 for 12 months was safe in HIV-infected subjects and effective in increasing 25(OH)D. Supplementation improved in some clinically important HIV immune markers in subjects on HAART. Adjunct therapy with high-dose, daily vitD3 for HIV-infected subjects and for those on/off HAART requires further investigation.
