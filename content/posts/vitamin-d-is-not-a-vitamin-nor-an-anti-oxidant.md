# Vitamin D as in different

Preventive  Medicine 51  (2010) 195-196 (PDF is attached)

Randomized studies have  now  essentially debunked the  naive  vision  of all vitamins as being  good  for health no matter what the  dose.  The first  shock came  from  the  demonstration that high doses of beta-carotene compared to placebo increased lung  cancer risk among smokers in Finland (ATBC, 1994) and in the  US (Hennekens et al., 1996; Omenn et al., 1996). Then came  the evidence that vitamin E was  ineffective for preventing cardiovascular diseases (Sesso et al., 2008) or cancer (Lin et al., 2009), and at high doses could  even  be life-threatening (Miller et al., 2005). Finally there are   the   continuing  sobering  negative results  about  the   potential  benefits  of  high   doses  of multivitamin, multimineral supplements, vitamin C, for all types of indications (e.g., Douglas  et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2009; Mulholland and Bedford, 2007; Huang  et al., 2006), even though there seem to be no major side effects  in the  case of vitamin C.

Vitamins  A, C, and E are all anti-oxidants. They are believed to trap free radicals and thus protect cells from their damaging oxidative effects. We definitely need them, they  are indispensable for our metabolism, but  they  should not  and  need not  be  used  beyond the  daily  dietary recommended doses.  Indeed, a too-neglected positive message came  from  the  French large  community trial SU.VI. MAX, in which a cocktail-pill of vitamins A, E, and C and of anti-oxidant minerals, not exceeding the  dietary recommended doses,  was  found to have  a protective effect  against cancer in men,  but  not women (Hercberg et al., 2004).

Vitamin D is different.  **First, it is not  an anti-oxidant.**  The more we  learn about vitamin D, the  more healthful it seems to be. Most tissues and cells in the body have a vitamin D receptor involved in the  regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and  death (Holick, 2007).  Its effects  on bone  mass, osteoporosis, and  fractures are  well  known and  established,  but  vitamin D also  has beneficial effects  on many chronic illnesses, including autoimmune and infectious diseases (Holick, 2007). Dietary supplementation with vitamin D appears to reduce the  risks of cancer (Lappe et al., 2007) and  overall mortality (Autier and Gandini, 2007).

What about cardiovascular diseases, the  most common cause  of death in many regions of the  world (WHO, 2008)? A deficit of vitamin D seems to be detrimental in this major health domain too. This  issue   of  Preventive   Medicine  includes a  study by  Grandi et  al.  reporting the   results of  a systematic  review and    **meta-analysis**  of  cohort studies relating serum  vitamin D  (25-hydro- xyvitamin D, abbreviated 25-OH-D) to cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality (Grandi et al., 2010). Compared to those in the highest category of vitamin D intake, defined either by quartiles or quintiles, those in the  lowest categories of serum vitamin D had  an increased meta-analytic risk of cardiovascular events of 1.5 for incidence and  of 1.8 for death.

 **Vitamin D is different from  vitamins A and  E**  in another way which can be decisively important when designing community interventions. It has  been used at very  high  doses for many months without toxic effects. This makes sense if you will permit us a small speculative digression. Vitamins are molecules that are so common in our environment that there was no evolutionary pressure for humans to self-synthesize them. There  is a limited natural supply of vitamins A and E, so there was no selection advantage of consuming doses superior to those that we  can  reasonably found  in our food. But we get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight, which our ancestors had in huge amounts. We are therefore likely to be configured to stand high  daily doses of vitamin D over  long periods.

Dependence on  sunlight also  makes vitamin D intake different from  that  of  other vitamins, because protecting ourselves from  UV exposure has resulted in widespread vitamin D deficiency in many regions of the  world (Holick, 2007).

Doesn't vitamin D appear as the  perfect candidate for community supplementation trials? Its deficit  is prevalent. It seems associated  with increased risk  for common chronic diseases. To our knowledge, there is a good dose  margin before it can become toxic,  at least  among people free  of kidney diseases. Too good to be true? We would welcome in Preventive Medicine data  or ideas  that would take  us further in this  direction.
