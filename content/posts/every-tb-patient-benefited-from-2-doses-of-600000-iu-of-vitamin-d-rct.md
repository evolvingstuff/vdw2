Background 

Vitamin D enhances host protective immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis by suppressing Interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and reducing disease associated inflammation in the host. The objectives of this study were to determine whether vitamin D supplementation to patients with tuberculosis (TB) could influence recovery.

Methods

Two hundred and fifty nine patients with pulmonary TB were randomized to receive either 600,000 IU of Intramuscular vitamin D3 or placebo for 2 doses. Assessments were performed at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Early secreted and T cell activated 6 kDa (ESAT6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis sonicate (MTBs) antigen induced whole blood stimulated IFN-g responses were measured at 0 and 12 weeks. Statistical comparisons between outcome variables at 0 and 12 weeks were performed using Student's t-test and Chi 2 tests.

Results

After 12 weeks, the vitamin D supplemented arm demonstrated significantly 

* greater mean weight gain (kg) + 3.75, (3.16 -- 4.34) 

> versus + 2.61 (95% CI 1.99 -- 3.23) p 0.009 and 

* lesser residual disease by chest radiograph; 

* number of zones involved 1.35 v/s 1.82 p 0.004 (95% CI 0.15, 0.79) and 

* 50% or greater reduction in cavity size 106 (89.8%) v/s 111 (94.8%), p 0.035. 

Vitamin D supplementation led to significant increase in MTBs-induced IFN-g secretion in patients with baseline 'Deficient' 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels (p 0.021).

Conclusions

Supplementation with high doses of vitamin D accelerated clinical, radiographic improvement in all TB patients and increased host immune activation in patients with baseline 'Deficient' serum vitamin D levels. These results suggest a therapeutic role for vitamin D in the treatment of TB.
