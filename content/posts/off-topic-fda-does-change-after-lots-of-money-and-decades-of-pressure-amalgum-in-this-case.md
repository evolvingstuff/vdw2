#### [Success — FDA Finally Issues Amalgam Warning](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/10/06/fda-dental-amalgam-warning.aspx?cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20201006Z1&mid=DM673278&rid=981104905) Mercola

 **Story Highlights** 

* September 24, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released its long-overdue safety communication on amalgam

* The FDA warns mercury fillings may adversely affect people in certain high-risk groups and should be avoided

* Groups identified as being at increased risk for harmful effects from dental mercury fillings include

   * pregnant women and their developing fetuses, 

   * nursing women, 

   * women who are planning to become pregnant, 

   * infants and children under the age of 6, 

   * people with neurological diseases, 

   * impaired kidney function or heightened sensitivity to mercury or other amalgam components

* After years of pressure from Consumers for Dental Choice and its allies, the FDA finally agreed to reopen the amalgam issue, and now admits dental amalgam releases mercury vapor that can cause health problems in some individuals

* The FDA also advised against use of the misleading term “silver fillings,” and urges patients to discuss all dental filling options with their dentist

* "The FDA is legally required to classify — that is, issue a rule for — all medical devices, including dental amalgam. But for 30 years, FDA dodged its legal duty to classify amalgam."

> > "Of course, Dr. Matthews wasn’t able to simply walk into his hospital and declare a new strategy for using vitamin D on all patients. It took much convincing, and that convincing began with, of all people, the staff nutritionist."

> > "“The best way I could explain what I was talking about was to show the nutritionist our patients’ vitamin D levels as they were admitted,” he explains. “I would order the test right away and as they’d come back, I’d walk over to the nutritionist and show her. We had some horribly low levels. The average person coming into the ICU at Grady had a hydroxyvitamin D level of 15 ng/mL, which is very, very low. But we’d see people with single digit numbers. Four. Six. Once I showed the nutritionists these numbers, my question to them was, ‘Why aren’t you checking vitamin D levels?’” "

 **On LEF Website** 

FDA: Failure, Deception, Abuse consists of FDA exposé articles William Faloon and others have written over the past 14 years. The book represents a compilation of FDA atrocities that have never appeared together in one publication. The objective is to disseminate this book, published by Praktikos Books (www.Praktikosbooks.com), far and wide in order to enlighten this country about the urgent need for radical FDA reform.

Armed with the unassailable data provided in FDA: Failure, Deception, Abuse, the ground-work has been laid for citizens to rise up against FDA oppressors and demand Congress enact immediate and radical FDA reform, including allowing Americans to access any therapy they believe may save their lives (as long as fraud is not involved). If radical FDA reform is not enacted, most people reading this article will suffer premature aging and death.
