Please include information from the attachment</a></strong></p><p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p><p>The relationship between statins and vitamin D has emerged as a critical area of investigation due to the widespread use of statins for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency globally. This report synthesizes evidence from clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses to explore the bidirectional interactions between statins and vitamin D. Key findings include statins&rsquo; modest cardiovascular benefits (1.3% absolute risk reduction in heart attacks)1, their association with musculoskeletal side effects, and the role of vitamin D in mitigating statin-induced myopathy.

In recent years, the important role of vitamin D in muscle health maintenance has been highlighted. In addition, hypovitaminosis D is very prevalent and might be a reversible risk factor for SAMS occurrence.</p><p>Methods: In our controlled intervention study, patients suffering from both SAMS and hypovitaminosis D underwent vitamin D replacement for 6 months. SAMS intensity and its impact on the quality of life were evaluated with a questionnaire during follow-up. A subgroup of patients who were not at the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target attempted a statin rechallenge after 3 months. Control subjects, with SAMS only, were not treated.</p><p>Results: Blood vitamin D levels reached 261% of baseline values.</p><ul><li><p>Pain intensity was reduced by 63%, and</p></li><li><p>all life quality indicators improved.</p></li></ul><p>At follow-up, percentage variations in SAMS intensity and in vitamin D levels were inversely related (r = 0.57, P = 0.002). In a multiple regression analysis, this association was found to be independent. Among the rechallenge subgroup,** 75% successfully tolerated high-intensity statins during the follow-up **. The parameters of interest were unchanged in control subjects.</p><p>Conclusions: In our findings, the amount of increase in vitamin D concentrations is directly related to SAMS improvement. Although randomized studies are needed, 25(OH)D levels can be measured and eventually supplemented in all patients suffering from SAMS, and this can be done together with a statin rechallenge after 3 months for patients who are not at the LDL-C target.</p><p>Register: The study protocol was registered with the** <a href=https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/>EudraCT clinical trial register</a> **<span>[ID: 2019-003250-83]</span> in date April 8, 2020.</p><hr><h3 id=found-the-reason-statins-can-make-your-muscles-sore-or-weak---june2023-americas-most-popular-drug-has-a-puzzling-side-effect-we-finally-know-whyhttpswwwtheatlanticcomhealtharchive202306the-gene-that-explains-statins-most-puzzling-side-effect674542utm_sourcefeed--poor-gene-enzyme-is-known-as-hmg-coa-reductase>Found: The reason statins can make your muscles sore or weak - June 2023** <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/the-gene-that-explains-statins-most-puzzling-side-effect/674542/?utm_source=feed">America’s Most Popular Drug Has a Puzzling Side Effect.

The primary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption) and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content (citrate synthase activity in the vastus lateralis) following simvastatin and/or vitamin D replacement therapy.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Twenty-eight patients completed the study. C decreased by 8.4% (P &lt; 0.05) following 12 weeks of simvastatin therapy. Vitamin D supplementation blunted the decline in cardiorespiratory fitness to 0.6% (P &lt; 0.05 for between-group difference in change from baseline).</p><p>Similarly, skeletal muscle mitochondrial content decreased by 3.6% with simvastatin but improved by 12.1% on supplementation with vitamin D, although the between-group difference was not significant. Vitamin D alone increased cardiorespiratory fitness and mitochondrial content by 7.1% (P &lt; 0.05) and 16.7%, respectively.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Simvastatin tends to cause deterioration in exercise-associated cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content in adults with T2DM, which is blunted by vitamin D supplementation.</p><hr><h3 id=people-taking-statins-have-15-ng-more-vitamin-d-after-adjustment---july2020-the-effect-of-statins-on-serum-vitamin-d-concentrations-among-older-adults-cureus-2020-jul-1127e8950-doi-107759cureus8950httpsdoiorg107759cureus8950>People taking statins have 1.5 ng more Vitamin D (after adjustment) - July 2020** The Effect of Statins on Serum Vitamin D Concentrations Among Older Adults **Cureus. 2020 Jul 1;12(7):e8950. <a href=https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8950.>doi: 10.7759/cureus.8950.</a></h3><p>Carlos H Orces 1, Martha Montalvan 2 3 4, Daniel Tettamanti 5 6 7</p><p>Background Randomized and observational studies have previously reported inconsistent results for the direct association between statin therapy and 25 hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the relationship between statin use and 25(OH)D and its metabolites concentrations in a large nationally representative sample of older adults.</p><p>Methods This study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were asked to show the medication containers of all the products used in the previous 30 days, and the prescription of statins was defined on the three-level nested therapeutic classification scheme of Cerner Multum&rsquo;s Lexicon. General linear models adjusted for potential confounders were created to compare 25(OH)D concentrations between older adults taking statins and those who did not.</p><p>Results A total of 6,261 participants with a mean age of 69.5 years comprised the study sample. Of those, 40.2% were taking statins with a median length of therapy of 5 years.** Adjusted mean 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D levels were 3.3 and 4.4 nmol/L higher among participants taking statins than those who did not **, respectively. Moreover, this association was consistently seen regardless of the duration of therapy and particularly in subjects taking simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin. In subgroup analyses according to BMI categories and vitamin D intake, higher 25(OH)D levels were also seen among statin users. By contrast, this association was attenuated among those with a daily vitamin D between 400 and 800 and >800 IU.</p><p>Conclusion Older adults on statin therapy had significantly higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Additional research should be conducted to define the mechanism of this association and determine if the pleiotropic effects attributed to statins may be mediated by vitamin D.</p><hr><h3 id=see-alsovitamindwiki>See also VitaminDWiki</h3><p>*** <a href=/posts/overview-cholesterol-and-vitamin-d>Overview Cholesterol and vitamin D</a> *** <a href=/posts/statins-with-low-vitamin-d-increased-chance-of-musculoskeletal-pain-by-2x>Statins with low vitamin D increased chance of musculoskeletal pain by 2X – Jan 2015</a> &lt; 15 ng</p><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/theories-on-the-interaction-between-statins-and-vitamin-d-2012>Theories on the interaction between statins and vitamin D – 2012</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/rosuvastatin-given-for-renal-problem-resulted-in-increased-vitamin-d-levels-rct>Rosuvastatin given for renal problem resulted in increased vitamin D levels – RCT Dec 2012</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/statin-pain-associated-with-10-ng-less-vitamin-d-meta-analysis>Statin pain associated with 10 ng less vitamin D – meta-analysis Oct 2014</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/off-topic-us-and-nz-permit-drug-advertising-on-tv-none-permit-tobacco-advertising>Off topic: US and NZ permit drug advertising on TV, none permit tobacco advertising</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/the-statin-crestor-dramatically-increases-levels-of-vitamin-d-in-the-blood>The statin Crestor dramatically increases levels of vitamin D in the blood – Jan 2012</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/one-statin-decreased-vitamin-d-levels-but-the-other-did-not>One statin decreased vitamin D levels but the other did not – March 2010</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/statin-induced-myalgias-corrected-with-100000-weekly-vitamin-d>Statin-induced Myalgias corrected with 100,000 weekly Vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/statins-associated-with-14x-increase-in-polymyalgia-rheumatica-a-new-disease>Statins associated with 14X increase in Polymyalgia Rheumatica (a new disease) – Aug 2012</a></p></li><li><p><span>[tiki-download_file.php?fileId=155]</span></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/statin-pain-eliminated-by-taking-50000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1814">Statin pain eliminated by taking 50,000 IU vitamin D weekly – July 2011</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/statin-use-increased-probability-of-diabetes-by-48-percent-perhaps-via-vitamin-d>Statin use increased probability of diabetes by 48 percent – perhaps via vitamin D Jan 2012</a></p></li></ul><p>Approximately 1 in every 4 adult Americans over 45 currently using statins to &ldquo;prevent heart disease.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/overview-cardiovascular-and-vitamin-d>Overview Cardiovascular and Vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/breast-cancer-2x-more-likely-if-have-taken-statins-for-10-years>Breast cancer 2X more likely if have taken statins for 10 years – July 2013</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/if-you-must-take-statins-and-want-to-avoid-hardening-of-arteries-take-vitamin-k2-rct>If you must take statins and want to avoid hardening of arteries, take vitamin K2 – RCT May 2015</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/the-statin-crestor-dramatically-increases-levels-of-vitamin-d-in-the-blood>The statin Crestor dramatically increases levels of vitamin D in the blood – Jan 2012</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/antibiotics-and-vitamin-d-are-associated-with-many-of-the-same-diseases>Antibiotics and Vitamin D are associated with many of the same diseases</a></p><ul><li>Statins were first developed as antibiotics</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h3 id=statin-intolerance-reduced-as-the-level-of-vitamin-d-is-raised---july2015>Statin intolerance reduced as the level of vitamin D is raised -

Repeated-measures analysis was used to compare 25(OH)D responses to vitamin D treatment at baseline and 6 and 12 months of statin users and nonusers, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, vitamin D dose, trial, and season.</p><p>RESULTS: At baseline, 17.5% were statin users, and 65% were vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL). Baseline 25(OH)D levels did not differ significantly between groups at baseline (18.8 for statin users, 17.2 ng/mL for nonusers, P = .07), but according to the longitudinal analyses, the total increase over 12 months in 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in statin users (13.1 ng/L) than nonusers (15.9 ng/mL; 21.4% difference; P = .009).** CONCLUSION: Of persons aged 60 and older at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, statin users had a 21.4% smaller increase in 25(OH)D serum concentrations over time than nonusers, independent of vitamin D dose and other covariates. <strong>PMID: 28240766 DOI: 10.1111/jgs.14784</strong> Publisher will rent the PDF for $6 **&mdash;</p><h3 id=do-statins-increase-the-level-of-vitamin-d-in-the-blood-in-the-shortterm-question-is-this-a-direct-effect-or-is-it-due-to-statins-reducing-cholesterol-which-is-needed-to-produce-vitamin-d-from-the-skin-but-cholesterol-is-not-needed-if-the-vitamin-d-is-taken-as-a-supplement--some-people-appear-to-think-that-vitamin-d-could-serve-the-same-function-as-statins-at-a-much-lower-cost-and-much-lower-risk--note-one-statin-is-the-top-selling-us-prescription-drug---with-more-sales-than-the-next-two-top-selling-drugs-img-srchttpsd1bk1kqxc0symcloudfrontnetattachmentsgiflist-of-best-selling-drugs-wikipedia---2006gif-altimage>Do statins increase the level of vitamin D in the blood in the short term?** Question: Is this a direct effect, or is it due to statins reducing cholesterol, which is needed to produce vitamin D from the skin, but cholesterol is not needed if the vitamin D is taken as a supplement **** Some people appear to think that vitamin D could serve the same function as statins at a much lower cost and much lower risk. **** Note: one statin is the top-selling US prescription drug - with more sales than the next two top-selling drugs **<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/list-of-best-selling-drugs-wikipedia---2006.gif alt=image></h3><hr><h3 id=see-alsoweb>See also Web</h3><ul><li><a href=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/30426/54/>Evidence shows Calcium supplementation is useless for the bones and dangerous for the heart</a>.

With an aging population, there has been increasing use of statin therapy to reduce the risk of CVD. However, statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) remain an obstacle to this treatment, leading to discontinuation and nonadherence to statin therapy. Signs and symptoms of SAMS include muscle pain, tenderness, and increased serum creatine kinase. Despite the idiopathic pathophysiology of SAMS, some studies have shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and SAMS; the use of vitamin D supplements can lead to relief of these symptoms. The purpose of this review was to critique evidence for the association between low serum vitamin D and SAMS and the use of vitamin D supplementation for treatment.</p><hr><h3 id=benefits-of-chocolate-on-the-heart-and-all-cause-mortality-vs-statins--2012>Benefits of Chocolate on the Heart and all-cause mortality (vs. statins) - 2012</h3><p><a href=http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/chocolate-gives-statins-29-billion-run-their-money>Green Med Info</a> April 2012</p><p>Great many health benefits of chocolate documented -</p><p>Regarding just the heart: Chocolate appears to be better than statins.</p><hr><h3 id=statin-health-problems---greenmedinfo---20152019-nothing-about-vitamin-d--2019-updatehttpswwwgreenmedinfocomblogcracking-cholesterol-myth-how-statins-harm-body-and-mind--cracking-the-cholesterol-myth-how-statins-harm-the-body-and-mindhttpwwwgreenmedinfocomblogcracking-cholesterol-myth-how-statins-harm-body-and-mind--a-new-study-finds-the-chemical-war-against-cholesterol-using-statin-drugs-was-justified-through-statistical-deception-and-the-cover-up-of-over-300-adverse-health-effects-documented-in-the-biomedical-literature>Statin Health problems - GreenMedInfo - 2015, 2019** nothing about vitamin D **** <a href=https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cracking-cholesterol-myth-how-statins-harm-body-and-mind>2019 update</a> ***** <a href=http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/cracking-cholesterol-myth-how-statins-harm-body-and-mind>Cracking the Cholesterol Myth: How Statins Harm The Body and Mind</a> **> A new study finds the chemical war against cholesterol using statin drugs was justified through statistical deception and the cover-up of over 300 adverse health effects documented in the biomedical literature</h3><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Muscle damage 80 studies</td><td>Nerve damage 54 studies</td><td>> Liver damage 32 studies</td></tr><tr><td>Endocrine disruption: 16 studies</td><td>Cancer-promoting: 9 studies</td><td>Diabetes-promoting: 8 studies</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiovascular-damaging: 15 studies</td><td>Birth defect Causing 11 studies</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li><p>The JUPITER trial of Crestor vs. placebo resulted in increased fatal heart attacks in the treatment group, which were obscured by combing fatal and nonfatal infarctions.</p></li><li><p>The HPS study had a 26% dropout rate prior to the beginning of the trial, so those with significant side effects were functionally excluded from the study.</p></li><li><p>In at least four trials, statistically significant increases in cancer incidence were found, and handily dismissed by all authors as insignificant because they claimed &ldquo;no known potential biological basis&rdquo; is known.</p></li><li><p>A low serum cholesterol level has also been found to serve as a biological marker of major depression and suicidal behavior,</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>suicidal ideation among adults with mood disorders was more than 2.5-times greater in those taking statins</p></blockquote><ul><li>&ldquo;So, the next time you hear of a doctor recommending a cholesterol-lowering intervention, tell him you&rsquo;ll take that 1% risk and spare yourself cancer, cognitive dysfunction, myopathy, and diabetes&rdquo;** Aug 2016 Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLShgWavVG8ind">Statin Drugs Linked to 300+ Adverse Effects</a> **&mdash;</li></ul><h3 id=if-you-really-must-take-statins-and-they-cause-pain-vitamin-d-will-relieve-the-pain--2015>If you really must take statins and they cause pain, vitamin D will relieve the pain - 2015</h3><p><a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838999>Statin Intolerance Because of Myalgia, Myositis, Myopathy, or Myonecrosis Can in Most Cases be Safely Resolved by Vitamin D Supplementation</a> March 2015</p><p>50,000 or 100,000 IU of vitamin** <span style=color:#00f>D2</span> <strong>per week relieved statin pain</strong> <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/statin-intolerance.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> *** <a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/reviews/vitamin_D_supplements_review/Vitamin_D/?utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter&amp;email=HLAHORE@GMAIL.COM&amp;firstname=#statins">ConsumerLabs</a> has a nice summary of this as well as many other vitamin D studies behind a subscription paywall</p><blockquote><p>Their paywall is very much worth the price.

Ruckmani, M. Abishek, S. Govindaraju.</p><p>Background: Statins are well-known drugs used in dyslipidemia and cardiac disorders for several years. Recently, it has been reported that long-term use of statins reduces serum vitamin D levels. When statins are administered to patients with low vitamin D, more muscular side effects have been reported. On the contrary, a few studies report that statins might increase vitamin D levels competing with its metabolism. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the association between statins and vitamin D.</p><p>Methods: 125 participants who fulfilled the selection criteria were enrolled in the study. 65 subjects belonged to the control group and 60 to the statin group. The blood sample was collected for Vitamin D estimation. The results were correlated with a demographic profile, the nature of statin, and the muscular side effects and compared with the control group.</p><p>Results: The mean vitamin D level in the statin group was 15.82 ng/ml±11.51 and 20.57 ng/ml±7.007 in the control group. The difference was found to be statistically significant. 13.85% in the control group and 10% in the statin group had sufficient vitamin D levels. 18.33% and 36.92 % had insufficient levels, and 71.67% and 49.23% had a deficiency in the statin and control groups, respectively. Myalgia was reported by 30 among 60 subjects (50%) in the statin group and 5 among 65 subjects (7.69%) in the control group.</p><p>Conclusion: The present study has shown that statin therapy is associated with low vitamin D levels and that this could contribute to the increased incidence of myalgia in the statin group.** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/statin-and-vitamin-d.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> **&mdash;</p><h3 id=statin-intolerance--statin-tolerance-after-adding-lots-of-vitamin-d---march2016-id-86-safety-of-50000-100000-units-of-vitamin-d3-per-week-in-vitamin-d-deficient-hypercholesterolemic-patients-with-statin-intolerance-journal-of-investigative-medicine>Statin intolerance ==> statin tolerance after adding lots of vitamin D - March 2016** ID: 86: SAFETY OF 50,000-100,000 UNITS OF VITAMIN D3 PER WEEK IN VITAMIN D DEFICIENT, HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIC PATIENTS WITH STATIN INTOLERANCE **Journal of Investigative Medicine</h3><p>V Jetty, G Duhon, P Shah, M Prince, K Lee, M Goldenberg, A Kumar, CJ Glueck, P Wang</p><p>DOI: 10.1136/jim-2016-000120.39 Published 22 March 2016</p><p>Background In ∼85–90% of statin-intolerant patients, vitamin D deficiency (serum 25 (OH) D &lt;32 ng/ml) is a reversible cause of statin intolerance, usually requiring 50,000 to 100,000 units of vitamin D/week continuously to normalize serum vitamin D, and thus successfully allow reinstitution of statins which previously could not be tolerated because of myalgia-myositis.</p><p>Specific Aim In 274 statin-intolerant patients, all with low entry serum vitamin D (&lt;32 ng/ml, median 21 ng/ml), we assessed safety and efficacy of vitamin D supplementation (50,000–100,000 units/week) over treatment periods of 3 months (n=274), 3 and 6 months (n=161), 3, 6, and 9 months (n=58), and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (n=22).</p><p>Results In the 385 patients with a 3-month follow-up, taking mean 61,000 and median 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/week, median serum vitamin D rose from 20 to 42 ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001); vitamin D became high (>100 ng/ml) but not toxic-high (>150 ng/ml) in 4 patients (1.0%) (101, 102, 106, 138 ng/ml). Median serum calcium was unchanged from entry (9.6 mg/dl) to 9.6 at 3 months. On vitamin D supplementation, the trend of change in serum calcium from normal-to-high or from high to normal did not significantly differ (McNemar S=1.0, p=0.32), and there was no significant trend in change of the calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from entry to follow-up (McNemar S=2.6, p=0.11).</p><p>In the 161 patients with 3 and 6-month follow-up, taking mean 67,000 and median 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/week, median entry serum vitamin D rose from 21 to 42 to 44 ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001), serum vitamin D was high (>100 but &lt;150 ng/ml) in 2 patients at 3 months (1.2%, 101, 102 mg/ml) and in 3 (1.9%) at 6 months (101, 140, 140 ng/ml). Median serum calcium was unchanged from entry (9.7 mg/dl) at 3 and 6 months (9.7, 9.6 mg/dl, p>0.05). On vitamin D supplementation, the change in serum calcium from normal-to-high or high-to-normal was no significant trend (McNemar S=0.7, p=0.41), and no trend in change of eGFR (McNemar S=1.3, p=0.26).</p><p>In the 58 patients with 3, 6, and 9-month follow-up on mean and median 71,000 and 100,000 IU of D3/week, median entry vitamin D rose from 20 to 37, 41, and 44 ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001), with 1 (1.7%, 102 ng/ml), 2 (3.5%, 140, 140 ng/ml), and 0 (0%) patients high. Median serum calcium was unchanged from entry, median 9.7, 9.8, 9.6, and 9.6 mg/dl. On vitamin D supplementation, the trend of change in serum calcium from normal-to-high or high-to-normal was not significant (McNemar S=1.8, p=0.18), and no trend in change of eGFR (McNemar S=2, p=0.16).</p><p>In the 22 patients with follow-up at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months on mean and median 70,000 and 75,000 IU of D3/week, median serum vitamin D rose from 20 to 37, to 41, to 44, and to 43 ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001), with 1 (5%, 102 ng/ml) high, 2 (9%, 140, 140) high, 0 (0%) high, and 1 (5%, 126 ng/ml) high.
