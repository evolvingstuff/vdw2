#### [Mini Strokes: Temporary Episodes Shorten Lives](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Longevity/tias-mini-strokes-shorten-lives/story?id=14924889#.Tr0r-PKOfZ0) ABC News

22,157 Australian adults hospitalized with a TIA from July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2007, 

At 10 years after TIA the death rate was about  2X higher than those of same age, etc.

#### The researchers found that other diagnoses compounded TIA survivors' risk of dying.

Congestive heart failure more than tripled it.  = 6X

Prior hospitalization for stroke more than doubled it,  = 4X

while a type of irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation doubled it. = 4X

As of Nov 2011 no apparent studies of TIA and Vitamin D

* Vitamin D to prevent the TIA

* Vitamin D to treat the TIA

#### However, note from: [Transient Ischemic Attack](http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tia/tia.htm) NIH

#### The most important treatable factors linked to  **<span style="color:#00F;">TIAs and stroke</span>**  are:

* high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, heart disease, carotid artery disease, diabetes, and heavy use of alcohol.

* ALL of which either cause or are related to low levels of vitamin D
