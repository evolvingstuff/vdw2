#### South Korea: Government to compensate for all post Covid-19 vaccination deaths within 90 days of the jab, regardless of proof of causality

 **[Trial Site News 1](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/south-korea-government-to-compensate-for-all-post-covid-19-vaccination-deaths-within-90-days-of-the-jab-regardless-of-proof-of-causality-b3cb92ed) &nbsp; &nbsp; [Trial Site News 2](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/south-korea-assumes-responsibility-for-covid-vax-deaths-by-expanding-compensation-and-eligibility-requirements-876f4a33)**

 **Some questions in #1** 

1. Does it make sense to have a compensation system, from the tax-payer to the tax-payer, for harms caused by a product produced by a profit making private entity?

1. Is financial compensation a just response to post-vaccination adverse events if proper informed consent was never disseminated, and people were misinformed, misled or even coerced to get jabbed?

1. What about justice for the un-jabbed who chose not to expose themselves to known & possibly unknown adverse effects of a novel medical product, and were unfairly discriminated against as a "consequence" of this "choice"?

1. Given the massive Covid-19 waves post mass administration of vaccines, and thousands who've been compensated for vaccine injury, has there been a tremendous toll on life, limb & tax payer's money? What would've the impact been in the absence of any vaccination campaign?
