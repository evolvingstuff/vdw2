#### Deconstructing HHS: Influenza Vaccine Propaganda - Robert Malone

 **[Substack](https://www.malone.news/p/deconstructing-hhs-influenza-vaccine?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=583200&amp;post_id=156851641&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=ofo3r&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email)** 

* What if I told you that increasing annual influenza vaccination of the elderly is associated with  **increased influenza-related death in the elderly** 

&gt; 

* What if I told you that annual influenza vaccination can make you  **more susceptible**  to influenza-like illness?

&gt; 

* What if I told you that deploying leaky influenza vaccines (into either humans or poultry flocks) will  **accelerate the evolution**  of vaccine-resistant influenza viruses?

&gt; 

* What if I told you that the real problem with influenza virus-associated death in the elderly is due to the aging of their immune systems (immunosenescence)?

&gt; 

* What if I told you that most of the 1918 “Spanish Flu” deaths could have been prevented if (antibacterial) antibiotics had been available?

&gt; 

* What if I told you that  **most countries do not recommend**  population-wide annual influenza vaccination?

&gt; 

* What if I told you that USG annual influenza vaccination policy is influenced by a desire to - **support and maintain- influenza manufacturing capacity** ?

&gt; 

* What if I told you that most of what you have been told about annual influenza vaccination is propaganda?

I am an expert on influenza and influenza vaccine development. I once held the position of Director, Clinical Influenza Vaccine Development at Solvay (now Abvie) Pharmaceuticals under an approx. 350M$ US Government BARDA contract. I have won and/or managed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts for development of more effective influenza vaccines. I have spoken (by invitation) on innovative influenza vaccine development at the World Health Organization in Geneva. I also have lost clients and at least one job for just (internally) discussing the issue of influenza vaccines and “original antigenic sin”- which is a forbidden topic among influenza vaccine manufacturers and the scientific-medical guild that supports this industry.

##### Only 16% of countries have population-wide vaccination policies [Perplexity AI Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-of-people-live-in-countri-MBiCSimsTE2vtKMpumFvCA)

* &quot;As of 2022, 16% of countries reported having a universal recommendation for seasonal influenza vaccination. . . &quot;

* &quot;. Most countries focus their vaccination recommendations on specific priority groups   
rather than the general population,   
including health workers, people with chronic conditions, older adults, and pregnant women&quot;

*What if I told you that increasing annual influenza vaccination of the elderly is associated with __increased influenza-related death in the elderly__
+
*What if I told you that annual influenza vaccination can make you __more susceptible__ to influenza-like illness?
+
*What if I told you that deploying leaky influenza vaccines (into either humans or poultry flocks) will __accelerate the evolution__ of vaccine-resistant influenza viruses?
+
*What if I told you that the real problem with influenza virus-associated death in the elderly is due to the aging of their immune systems (immunosenescence)?
+
*What if I told you that most of the 1918 “Spanish Flu” deaths could have been prevented if (antibacterial) antibiotics had been available?
+
*What if I told you that __most countries do not recommend__ population-wide annual influenza vaccination?
+
*What if I told you that USG annual influenza vaccination policy is influenced by a desire to -__support and maintain- influenza manufacturing capacity__?
+
*What if I told you that most of what you have been told about annual influenza vaccination is propaganda?
I am an expert on influenza and influenza vaccine development. I once held the position of Director, Clinical Influenza Vaccine Development at Solvay (now Abvie) Pharmaceuticals under an approx. 350M$ US Government BARDA contract. I have won and/or managed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts for development of more effective influenza vaccines. I have spoken (by invitation) on innovative influenza vaccine development at the World Health Organization in Geneva. I also have lost clients and at least one job for just (internally) discussing the issue of influenza vaccines and “original antigenic sin”- which is a forbidden topic among influenza vaccine manufacturers and the scientific-medical guild that supports this industry.
