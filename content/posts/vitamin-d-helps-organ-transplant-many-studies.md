#### Summary of many studies of Vitamin D and organ transplantation

 **More vitamin D needed especially needed if organ = liver or kidney (low vitamin d ==> poor bones)** 

 **Both regular and active vitamin D have been used** 

 **Supplementation can be oral, injection, etc** 

 **Extra Vitamin D can be before or after the surgery** 

 **Problems avoided include: infection, rejection, death**

#### Vitamin D in organ transplantation - 2011

Osteoporos Int. 2011 Jan 5. 

Stein EM, Shane E.

Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, PH8-864, New York, NY, 10032, USA, es2029@columbia.edu.

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among patients with end-stage organ failure awaiting transplant. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in these patients may be related to many disease-specific factors, as well as decreased sunlight exposure and limited intake of foods containing vitamin D. 

Low serum 25-OHD levels are also extremely common following solid organ transplantation, both during the immediate postoperative period and in long-term graft recipients. 

Demographic and lifestyle factors are important in determining D status in transplant recipients. 

Worse vitamin D status is associated with poorer general health, lower albumin, and even decreased survival among these patients. 

Although several studies have demonstrated that active forms of vitamin D and its analogues prevent bone loss following transplantation, the data do not show consistent benefit. 

These therapies may have particular utility after renal transplantation. However, given the  **narrow therapeutic window with respect to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria** , and the demonstrated efficacy of bisphosphonates to prevent post-transplantation bone loss, we regard these agents as adjunctive rather than primary therapy for transplantation osteoporosis. 

The effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D on the immune system, which are still being elucidated, may have potential for reducing infections and preventing allograft rejection after transplantation. PMID: 21207011

   * "A recent study found fewer than 20% of solid organ transplant patients mounted detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 following a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, raising questions about vaccine protection in this population compared to immunocompetent people."

   * "Now in transplant patients, what we found is that  **only 17% have detectable antibody after dose one** . "
