### [Liley Medal for 'game-changing' vitamin D study](http://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-media/news/liley-medal-game-changing-vitamin-d-study)

* "University of Auckland Distinguished Professor  **Ian Reid**  was tonight presented with the Health Research Council of New Zealand’s (HRC) Liley Medal at the 2015 Research Honours Dinner for his outstanding contribution to health and medical sciences in advancing treatment of the bone disorder osteoporosis."

* " Data from 23 trials involving more than 4000 patients showed  **no evidence that bone density significally improved**  after taking vitamin D supplements."

* "HRC Chief Executive Professor Kath McPherson says this study, which was funded by the HRC, has changed – and will likely continue to change – practice in the osteoporosis field."

VitaminDWiki suspects that the NZ govt got it's money worth.

That single paper might reduce the cost of vitamin D testing by well over $1,000,000

But, unfortunately, may increase the costs due to low vitamin D by 10X to 100X as much
