Introduction: While observational research suggests a protective role for nutrition in brain aging, intervention studies remain inconclusive. This failing translation from observational to interventional research may result from overlooking nutrient interactions.

Methods: We developed a nutrient status index capturing the number of suboptimal statuses of omega-3 fatty acids, homocysteine, and vitamin D (range 0 to 3). We associated this index with dementia incidence in a subsample (age ≥ 50 years) of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort.

Results: Among 968 participants, 79 developed dementia over 15.5 years (median follow-up). Each point increase in nutrient status index was associated with a 50% higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span> = 1.50; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 1.16, 1.96). Participants with three high-risk statuses had a four-fold increased risk of dementia compared to participants without high-risk status ( **HR = 4.68** ; 95% CI = 1.69, 12.94).

Discussion: Concurrent nutrient deficiencies are associated with the risk of dementia. The potential of optimizing nutritional status to lower dementia risk warrants further study.

Highlights: Nutrition and dementia research calls for multiple-nutrient approaches. We studied combined suboptimal statuses of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, homocysteine, and vitamin D. Suboptimal status of the three nutrients was associated with dementia risk. The risk estimate was larger than for other factors (ie, diabetes, apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier). Future studies should assess the effect of improving nutrient status on dementia risk.
