Introduction: Bladder neoplasm ranks as the second most prevalent reproductive system malignancy worldwide. On the other hand, the vitamin D as an anti-cancer agent has been a subject of long-standing speculation. Hence, the objective of this study is to explore the correlation between vitamin D and bladder neoplasm risk.

Materials and Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis were designed following the PRISMA checklist. Eligible studies were identified through searches on ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane, with no time restrictions until November 18, 2023. Data analysis was conducted utilizing the STATA 14 software.

Results: Serum vitamin D levels less than 50 nmol/L increased the risk of

* bladder neoplasm (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.64), 

* muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.80, 4.14) and 

* non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (OR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.39, 2.52)). 

However, the risk of bladder neoplasm in people whose serum vitamin D level was less than 50 nmol/L did not increase with age. Vitamin D serum levels greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L in people aged 40 to 49 (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.99) prevented bladder neoplasm, but no significant association was seen in people over 50 years old. In addition, there was no significant association between daily vitamin D intake and the risk of bladder neoplasm (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.63, 2.06).

Conclusion: The serum vitamin D less than 50 nmol/L was correlated with bladder cancer risk increasing, including MIBC and NMIBC.

Introduction: Bladder neoplasm ranks as the second most prevalent reproductive system malignancy worldwide. On the other hand, the vitamin D as an anti-cancer agent has been a subject of long-standing speculation. Hence, the objective of this study is to explore the correlation between vitamin D and bladder neoplasm risk.

Materials and Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis were designed following the PRISMA checklist. Eligible studies were identified through searches on ProQuest, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane, with no time restrictions until November 18, 2023. Data analysis was conducted utilizing the STATA 14 software.

Results: Serum vitamin D levels less than 50 nmol/L increased the risk of
*bladder neoplasm (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.64), 
*muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) (OR: 2.73; 95% CI: 1.80, 4.14) and 
*non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) (OR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.39, 2.52)). 
However, the risk of bladder neoplasm in people whose serum vitamin D level was less than 50 nmol/L did not increase with age. Vitamin D serum levels greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L in people aged 40 to 49 (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.99) prevented bladder neoplasm, but no significant association was seen in people over 50 years old. In addition, there was no significant association between daily vitamin D intake and the risk of bladder neoplasm (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.63, 2.06).
