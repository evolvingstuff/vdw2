Severe deficiency of this vitamin leads to soft bones that bend and break easily — referred to as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.</p><p>The major source of vitamin D for most humans is exposure to sunlight. There is, however, much more to the ‘sunshine vitamin’ when it comes to what it does for us.</p><p>Though this vitamin is naturally present in very few foods, it is added to foods through fortification in developed countries. A long-held assumption that the vitamin D content of the food supply is sufficient to maintain healthy circulating levels when adequate sun exposure is compromised is a fallacy worldwide. Even in country like ours with plenty of sunshine, this deficiency is being recognised.</p><p>Rich food sources include fish, oils, ghee, butter and egg yolk. Compared to fish-liver oil, which is the best dietary source of vitamin D, other foods are quite low in this vitamin. Ideally, a diet that includes dairy, fish and egg yolk coupled with adequate exposure to sunshine should prevent vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>However strangely, deficiency of this vitamin appears to be widespread.</p><p>An exposure of half an hour a day, around mid-day (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.), is recommended. However, despite abundant sunshine, Indians are particularly prone to vitamin D deficiency. Some of the reasons could be inadequate exposure to sunlight, particularly for those who remain indoors during the day (inside office) or home-bound elderly and an increased use of sunscreens, which is recommended for prevention of skin cancer.</p><p>Research has also shown that Indian skin pigmentation needs several times more exposure to sunlight, as compared to fair-skinned, in order to generate the same amount of this vitamin.</p><p>In general, the greater the skin pigmentation, the lesser vitamin D is produced. In India, vitamin D deficiency is more common in pregnant women, school going children, young adults and elderly. Vitamin D deficiency can occur without any symptoms but when symptoms occur it indicates severe deficiency.</p><p>Vigilance of one’s vitamin D status by the yearly measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the storage form of this vitamin which correlates best with deficiency symptoms, is suggested to be a part of an annual physical examination. A significant role of this hormone is as an immune enhancer. The hormone stimulates white blood cells which regulate the immune system.</p><p>Studies suggest a link between vitamin D and Tuberculosis. In one study, one third of the total subjects suffering from tuberculosis were found to have vitamin D deficiency and supplementation with vitamin D significantly enhanced recovery from tuberculosis. There is some evidence for a role of vitamin D reducing the risk of pneumonia.</p><p>Studies have also found a relationship between vitamin D and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D deficiency also increases the risk of respiratory infections as well. High intake of vitamin D by pregnant mothers reduces the risk of asthma by as much as 40 per cent in children in the age group between 3 and 5 years.</p><hr><h1 id=a-hrefpostsclick-here-stylecolor-red-text-decoration-underline-titlethis-link-has-an-unknown-page_id-11click-herea-for-more-information-on-vitamin-d><a href=/posts/click-here style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 11">CLICK HERE</a> for more information on Vitamin D</h1><h2 id=a-hrefposts24-reasons-for-the-vitamin-d-deficiency-epidemic-stylecolor-red-text-decoration-underline-titlethis-link-has-an-unknown-page_id-158624-reasons-for-the-vitamin-d-deficiency-epidemica><a href=/posts/24-reasons-for-the-vitamin-d-deficiency-epidemic style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1586">24 reasons for the Vitamin D deficiency epidemic</a></h2></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1750249976"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1750249976",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1750249976"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1750249976"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1750249976"></script></body></html>
