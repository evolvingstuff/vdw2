PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder which affects millions around the world. The incidence of T1D in children is increasing worldwide at a rate that cannot be explained by genetics alone. This review explores the recent research regarding possible causes of this epidemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: Investigation into T1D epidemiology has recently focused on several hypotheses. 

These theories include : 

* role of infections, 

* early childhood diet, 

* vitamin D exposure, 

* environmental pollutants, 

* increased height velocity, 

* obesity, and 

* insulin resistance 

in the risk for T1D. Over the past year, the evidence has strengthened for early childhood infections, dietary proteins, and insulin resistance as risk factors for T1D, but not for vitamin D exposure or environmental pollutants.

SUMMARY: Investigation into the source of the current epidemic of T1D has shed light on several possible causes, but has not provided definitive answers, yet.

“Researchers in Finland examined maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy and found no association between intake of vitamin D and sub-sequent risk”

## They amazingly missed noticing the great reduction in type 1 Diabetes when vitamin D given AFTER birth in the same country, Finland.
