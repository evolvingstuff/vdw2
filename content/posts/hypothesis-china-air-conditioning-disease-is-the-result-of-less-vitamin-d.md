### [“Air Conditioning Disease”?](http://www.myhealthbeijing.com/illness/%E2%80%9Cair-conditioning-disease%E2%80%9D/)

 **By Dr. Richard Saint Cyr, on August 15th, 2010** 

Boy, was this summer a scorcher. Even as I write this, hundreds of people in Russia are still dying from heat stroke and the peat-fire pollution. Here in China, with the temperatures raging a couple weeks ago, most newspapers were filled with health advice stories. Discussing how to avoid heat stroke, of course? Uh, not really — many talked about that <span style="color:#900;">uniquely Chinese malady, “air conditioning disease“.</span>

Needless to say, air conditioning disease is not a Western, allopathic medicine diagnosis. There is no ICD-10 billing code for this. But here in China, everyone I talk with is completely convinced that many summer colds and illnesses are caused by air conditioning, or at least inappropriate use of it. It’s deeply ingrained with traditional Chinese medicine views of hot and cold winds bearing disease. And my TCM book mentions, “attack by cold and wind in summer will cause headache; fever; no sweating; aversion to cold; pain of limbs; abdominal pain; vomiting and diarrhea.” But is there any actual data out there that air conditioning use causes infections or disease?
