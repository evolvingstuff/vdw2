Purpose

Type-2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. This study examines temporal patterns of the global, regional, and national burden of T2DM in the last three decades.

Data and methods

The estimates of age, sex and location-wise incident cases, deaths, prevalent cases, and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) and risk factors for 21 regions and 204 countries are retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study from 1990 to 2019. Socio-demographic index (SDI) is used as the indicator of the development status of countries, and quadratic regression is employed to examine the relationship between country-level age-standardized rates and SDI.

Results

Globally, incident cases of T2DM more than doubled from 8.4 million <span>[95% uncertainty interval, 7.8–9.1 million]</span> in 1990 to 21.7 million <span>[20.0–23.5 million]</span> in 2019, and deaths more than doubled from 606,407 <span>[573,069–637,508]</span> to 1.5 million<span>[1.4–1.6 million]</span> between 1990 and 2019. 

Global T2DM  **prevalence**  increased from 

* 148.4 million <span>[135.5–162.6 million]</span> in 1990 to 

* 437.9 million<span>[402.0–477.0 million]</span> in 2019. 

In 2019, global age-standardized prevalence rate stood at 5282.8/100,000 <span>[4853.6–5752.1]</span>, varying from 2174.5/100,000 <span>[1924.3–2470.5]</span> in Mongolia to 19876.8/100,000 <span>[18211.1–21795.3]</span> in American Samoa. SDI exhibited inverted-U shaped relationship with country-level age-standardised rates. 

Globally, 

* high body-mass-index (51.9%), 

* ambient particulate matter pollution (13.6%), 

* smoking (9.9%) and 

* secondhand smoke (8.7%) 

were the major contributing risk factors towards T2DM DALYs in 2019.

Conclusion

With ubiquitously rising prevalent cases globally, particularly in low and middle-income countries and regions, T2DM requires immediate attention and targeted policy response worldwide centered on lifestyle interventions (e.g., physical activity, smoking, diet, and obesity), air pollution control and cost-effective timely treatment.
