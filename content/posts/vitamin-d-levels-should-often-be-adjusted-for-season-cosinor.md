Background/objectives: Seasonal variation may reduce the validity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) as a biomarker of vitamin D status. Here we aimed to identify potential determinants of seasonal variation in 25OHD concentrations and to evaluate cosinor modelling as a method to adjust single 25OHD measurements for seasonal variation.

Subjects/methods: In Caucasian cardiovascular patients (1999–2004), we measured 25OHD by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 4116 baseline and 528 follow-up samples. To baseline values, we fitted a cosinor model for monthly concentrations of 25OHD. Using the model, we estimated each patient’s adjusted annual 25OHD value. Further, we studied how covariates affected the annual mean 25OHD concentration and seasonal variation of the study cohort. To evaluate the model, we predicted follow-up measurements with and without covariates and compared accuracy with carrying forward baseline values and linear regression adjusting for season, common approaches in research and clinical practice, respectively.

Results: The annual mean (59.6 nmol/l) was associated with participants’ age, gender, smoking status, body mass, physical activity level, diabetes diagnosis, vitamin D supplement use and study site (adjusted models, P<0.05). Seasonal 25OHD variation was 15.8 nmol/l, and older age (>62 years) was associated with less variation (adjusted model, P=0.025). Prediction of follow-up measurements was more accurate with the cosinor model compared with the other approaches (P<0.05). Adding covariates to cosinor models did not improve prediction (P>0.05).

Conclusions: We find cosinor models suitable and flexible for analysing and adjusting for seasonal variation in 25OHD concentrations, which is influenced by age.

 **"Cosinor analysis uses the least squares method to fit a sine wave to a time series"** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">Reasons to be careful about "adjusting Vitamin D levels for season" include:</span>** 

1. Less seasonal variation if dark skin

1. Less seasonal variation if elderly

1. Less seasonal variation if female

1. Less seasonal variation if Crohn's

1. More seasonal variation if smoke, . . .

 **It is likely that most studies which "adjust" for season do not have separate adjustments for each of the above groups. Applying the same "adjustment" to those individuals which do not vary with season will result in levels being "adjusted" to be too high half fo the year and too low the other half of the year.**

Abstract: Background: Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of complications and adverse perinatal outcomes. We evaluated seasonal variation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> among pregnant women, focusing on patterns and determinants of variation. 

Methods: Data came from three cohort studies in the US that included 2583 non-Hispanic Black and White women having prenatal 25(OH)D concentrations determined. Fourier time series and generalised linear models were used to estimate the magnitude of 25(OH)D seasonality. We modelled seasonal variability using a stationary cosinor model to estimate the phase shift, peak?trough difference, and annual mean of 25(OH)D. 

Results: We observed a peak for 25(OH)D in summer, a nadir in winter, and a phase of 8 months, which resulted from fluctuations in 25(OH)D3 rather than 25(OH)D2. After adjustment for covariates, the annual mean concentrations and estimated peak?trough difference of 25(OH)D among  **Black women were 19.8 ng/mL**  <span>[95% confidence interval (CI) 18.9, 20.5]</span> and 5.8 ng/mL <span>[95% CI 4.7, 6.7]</span>, and for  **non-Hispanic White women were 33.0 ng/mL**  <span>[95% CI 32.6, 33.4]</span> and 7.4 ng/mL <span>[95% CI 6.0, 8.9]</span>. 

Conclusions: Non-Hispanic Black women had lower average 25(OH)D concentrations throughout the year and smaller seasonal variation levels than non-Hispanic White women. This study?s confirmation of 25(OH)D seasonality over a calendar year has the potential to enhance public health interventions targeted to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.
