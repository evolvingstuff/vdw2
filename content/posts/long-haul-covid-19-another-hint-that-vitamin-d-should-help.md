**["End of 2020 COVID19 Immunology Recap - PLUS - Special Update for Long-Haulers" ](https://youtu.be/HstxLZRRNG0)** 

Dr. Patterson attributes long-haul COVID19 to the absence of germinal centers and reports a low CD8 T-cell signature:  

See Minute 16 and min 40-49 ("when patients were getting better CD8+T-cells were going UP"):

Remember: CD8+T-cells have the  **highest amount of the vit D receptor of all immune cells** 

 **CD8+ T-Cell Deficiency, Epstein-Barr Virus Infection, Vitamin D Deficiency, and Steps to Autoimmunity: A Unifying Hypothesis - 2012** 

"Here it is proposed that this CD8+ T-cell deficiency underlies the development of chronic autoimmune diseases by impairing CD8+ T-cell control of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, with the result that EBV-infected autoreactive B cells accumulate in the target organ where they produce pathogenic autoantibodies and provide costimulatory survival signals to autoreactive T cells which would otherwise die in the target organ by activation-induced apoptosis. Autoimmunity is postulated to evolve in the following steps: (1) CD8+ T-cell deficiency, (2) primary EBV infection, (3) decreased CD8+ T-cell control of EBV. It is also proposed that deprivation of sunlight and vitamin D at higher latitudes facilitates the development of autoimmune diseases by aggravating the CD8+ T-cell deficiency and thereby further impairing control of EBV.
