If you feel you should ask your doctor, you should word your question so as to MINIMIZE his  liability risk.

Many doctors (at least in the US) are very concerned about liability.

You should not ask a question in such a way that they might INCREASE their risk of being sued.

Do not, for example, ask a question worded such as:

&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you recommend my taking more vitamin D?

Even if your doctor  **personally**  feels that more vitamin D could be good for you, 

&nbsp; &nbsp;your doctor will want to minimize their liability exposure by making a conservative/risk-avoiding statement. 

Even if he understands the power of vitamin D, he will rarely be likely to state: ‘’I believe that you should take more vitamin D.’’
