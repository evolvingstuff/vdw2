#### Increasing RA ==> right

In addition to its well-documented involvement in mineral homeostasis, vitamin D seems to have broad effects on human health that go beyond the skeletal system. Prominent among these so-called nonclassical effects of vitamin D are its immunomodulatory properties. In vitro studies have shown anti-inflammatory effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), the active form of vitamin D. In addition, epidemiological analysis of patients with established inflammatory disease identified associations between vitamin D deficiency (low serum concentrations of inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D, abbreviated to 25(OH)D) and inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 

The association of vitamin D deficiency with RA severity supports the hypothesis of a role for vitamin D in the  **initiation or progression of the disease, or possibly both** . However, whether 25(OH)D status is a cause or consequence of RA is still incompletely understood and requires further analysis in prospective vitamin D supplementation trials. The characterization of factors that promote the transition from preclinical to clinical phases of RA has become a major focus of research, with the aim to facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment, and improve therapeutic outcomes. In this Review, we aim to describe the current knowledge of vitamin D and the immune system specifically in RA, and discuss the potential benefits that vitamin D might have on slowing RA progression.
