* Yes, children and adults often fail to consistently take pills such as Vitamin D

* “Directly observed therapy” described by this study insures compliance

 **Other solutions, which are unique to vitamin D, include:** 

* Initiate therapy with a loading dose, providing positive feedback (less pain) a week instead of many months.

* Take only a few Vitamin D capsules per month from blister pack– easily see what has been taken during the month and take any remaining capsules by the end of the month

* Home fortification of food or drink with water soluble vitamin D

   * examples include: jam, peanut butter, milk, juice, cereal, . . 

* Injection once every 3 months: Home injections should be pre-labeled, eg. Jan, March, June, Sept 

 **This study found that achieving their Vitamin D goal did not treat osteopenia. It is unlikely that their goal was 40 nanograms/mL, which has been found to be needed to treat osteopenia. The goal of the study was probably 20 nanograms or possibly only 12.5 nanograms.**

Adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) develop osteopenia early in therapy, potentially exacerbated by high rates of concurrent Vitamin D deficiency. We conducted a randomized clinical trial testing a Vitamin D-based intervention to improve Vitamin D status and reduce bone density decline. Poor adherence to home supplementation necessitated a change to directly observed therapy (DOT) with intermittent, high-dose Vitamin D3 randomized versus standard of care (SOC). 

Compared to SOC, DOT Vitamin D3 successfully increased trough Vitamin 25(OH)D levels (p = .026) with 

* no residual Vitamin D deficiency, 

* 100% adherence to DOT Vitamin D3, and 

* without associated toxicity. 

However, neither Vitamin D status nor supplementation impacted bone density. 

Thus, this adherence-optimized intervention is feasible and effective to correct Vitamin D deficiency in adolescents during ALL therapy. 

 **Repletion of Vitamin D and calcium alone did not mitigate osteopenia, however, and new, comprehensive approaches are needed to address treatment-associated osteopenia during ALL therapy.**
