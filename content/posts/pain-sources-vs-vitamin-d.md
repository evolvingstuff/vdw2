Objectives: To investigate the correlation between baseline serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) and quality of life (QoL), as well as pain perception in patients with chronic pain with long-term prescription opioid usage before opioid detoxification. Methods: We prospectively studied 45 patients with chronic pain with long-term prescription opioid usage who were selected for elective detoxification. Baseline serum 25-OHD levels were measured prior to detoxification, classifying patients as either vitamin D deficient (<75 nmol/L) or sufficient (≥75 nmol/L). QoL was assessed using the SF-36v2TM questionnaire, while pain levels were assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores before treatment. Results: Mean pain scores before detoxification of the patients with sufficient baseline 25-OHD levels vs. those with deficient levels were, respectively, 6.06 ± 2.32 vs. 6.86 ± 2.10 (normalized scores 1.22 ± 0.571 vs. 0.950 ± 0.632; p = 0.164). The analysis of SF-36v2™ questionnaire scores revealed minimal variation between groups (35.00 ± 14.198 vs. 34.97 ± 13.52), indicating no significant association between Vitamin D levels and QoL (p = 0.913). Conclusions: The analysis of baseline 25-OHD levels in relation to QoL assessments and pain scores did not reveal a statistically significant association, indicating that variations in baseline vitamin D levels may not substantially impact QoL or pain perception. Further studies may help determine how to assess and optimize vitamin D levels in patients with chronic pain on long-term prescription opioids.
