**Dr. Combra protocol apparently greatly increased (fall 2017) the amount of Magnesium to be supplemented daily** 

You want much more than the RDA for Magnesium element, which is about 400 milligrams

* Vitamin D consumes Magnesium (Mg)

* The more Vitamin D which is consumed the more Magnesium is needed

* Without increased Magnesium levels a high level of vitamin D can cause all sorts of health problems – such as severe constipation

* Often the manufacturer will state the amount of Mg compound, not Mg element

* There are many Mg compounds

> Some forms, such as Magnesium Oxide, have very poor absorption

* Many Mg compounds will cause diarrhea if take the entire daily dose within an hour or so

 **Remag is one commercial product which “claims” to not result in diarrhea** 

Remag costs $30 for 48 teaspoons of liquid [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pico-Ionic-RnA-Formulated-Absorption-Experience/dp/B01LZLSJ7B/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1527560827&sr=8-1&keywords=remag&dpID=41YFdsWK%252BCL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)

300 mg of Mg element per teaspoon

900 milligrams would require 3 teaspoons of Remag ( **cost of $1.25/day** )

 **Nutricology has a Magnesium Chloride Liquid** 

$13 for 48 teaspoons of liquid.  Teaspoon contains 133 mg of Magnesium element

Also comes in coffee and salted camel flavors - for the same price

900 milligrams would require 7 teaspoons of Nutricology ( **cost of $1.85/day** )

 **Good State Liquid Ionic Magnesium** 

96 servings at 100 mg elemental, plus 2 mg fulvic acid - 8 fl oz [Amazon $19](https://www.amazon.com/Good-State-Magnesium-servings-elemental/dp/B005PFK3YS/ref=sr_1_6_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1527603825&sr=8-6&keywords=magnesium+chloride+liquid&dpID=41-FBYav7SL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)

10.7 servings of 900 milligrams in bottle ( **cost of $1.77/day** )

 **Magnesium Chloride is very low cost in bulk** 

$15 for 1000 grams of MgCl2 crystal (food grade bulk) = 170 grams of Mg

900 mg of Mg from bulk  **costs only 8 cents/day**  – many sources on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BulkSupplements-Magnesium-Glycinate-Powder-Kilogram/dp/B00F7OZJR8/ref=sr_1_30_sspa?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1527561035&sr=1-30-spons&keywords=magnesium%2Bchloride%2Bbulk&th=1%20)

thus 15X less expensive that ReMag:  **<span style="color:#00F;">$29/year vs $460/year</span>** 

[Many descriptions on the web for MgCl2 made at home](https://www.google.com/search?num=20&ei=aW8NW9-EJsW90PEP-L2IkAo&q=magnesium+chloride+homemade&oq=+%22magnesium+chloride%22+home&gs_l=psy-ab.1.6.0l3j0i22i30k1l7.163097.167017.0.173624.6.6.0.0.0.0.102.555.5j1.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.6.552...0i20i264k1j0i67k1.0.lTBZhIceam0)

1. Boil distilled water. Distilled water extends the shelf life of the mixture.

1. Place the magnesium chloride flakes in a glass bowl and the pour the boiling water over it.

> 20 day supply (@900 mg/day) = 10% of 1,000 bulk opackage

1. Stir well until completely dissolved.

1. Let cool completely  Crystals will form in the water and drop to the bottom of the bowl

1. Store liquid in a bottle.

Dr. Sircus says that 1 liter of concentrated Magnesium Chloride water/oil contains 80 grams of Magnesium

If 900 milligrams of Mg is needed, then 11 milliters is needed =  **2.23 teaspoon** 

Note: Dr. Sircus says that the amount of Magnesium needed is proportional to bodyweight

Note: We have tried all of the above liquids. My wife prefers Nutricology and I like the low cost of the bulk form

 **The Dr. Coimbra protocol includes drinking 2.5 liters of water daily** 

* It is very easy to just add the liquid Mg (Remag or MgCl2(H2O)x ) into the daily water to be consumed.

* You probably want to add some lemon juice or apple vinegar to the water to reduce the bitterness of those products
