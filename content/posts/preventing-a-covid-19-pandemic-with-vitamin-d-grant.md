#### Re: [Preventing a covid-19 pandemic](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m810/rr-42%20):  
Can vitamin D supplementation reduce the spread of COVID-19?   
Try first with health care workers and first responders.

#### There are better ways to prevent the spread

The best way to reduce the  **spread**  of COVID-19 is to massively apply Vitamin D to the hotspots  
The increased herd immunity will decrease the the number of individuals to which the virus can spread.   
Removing the fuel will make a fire go out.  
&nbsp;  
 **Outbreaks include**   
Senior home residents  
Sailors on Navy Ships  
 Prisoners   
Patients of psych wards  
Homeless  
Slums  
Local Hotspots  
&nbsp;  
 **Should also provide Vitamin D  "insurance" to people who contact many others**   
Hospital staff  
Politicians  
Celebrities  
&nbsp;  
 **Should also provide Vitamin D  "insurance" to essential workers**    
Grocery clerks  
Amazon distribution workers  
WalMart employees   
Truckers  
&nbsp;  
 **Social distancing and masks just flatten the curve**   
Vitamin D should actually reduce the total number who will ever get symptoms or go into the hospital

#### Dear Editor,

There is reasonable evidence that higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections. A meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials found an inverse relationship between vitamin D supplementation and incidence of acute respiratory tract infections, especially for those with 25(OH)D concentrations below 25 nmol/l <sup>[1]</sup>. Several mechanisms by which vitamin D reduces risk of respiratory tract infections have been identified. One is that cathelicidens and defensins are induced that have antimicrobial and antiendotoxin properties <sup>[2]</sup>. Another is that vitamin D reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases production of anti-inflammatory cytokines 2. The innate immune system often goes into overdrive during respiratory tract infections, resulting in the cytokine storm that can damage the lining of the lungs <sup>[3]</sup>. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations have been found to be inversely correlated with development of acute respiratory distress syndrome <sup>[4]</sup>.

An article tying this and other information together suggests that raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations to 100 â€“ 150 nmol/l should be able to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and death <sup>[5]</sup>. To reach those concentrations rapidly would take large doses of vitamin D for a week or two, followed by several thousand IU/d vitamin D for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such doses have been found not to have adverse health effects <sup>[6]</sup>. In addition, vitamin D reduces risk of many chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes mellitus in secondary analyses of large clinical trials <sup>[7]</sup>, and observational studies have found inverse correlations between serum 25(OH)D concentration and all-cause mortality rate up to 100 nmol/l <sup>[8]</sup>.

No results of clinical trials regarding vitamin D supplementation for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 have been reported. Thus, an important question is whether making a public health announcement that taking enough vitamin D to raise serum 25(OH)D concentrations is a good idea. On the pro side, high-dose vitamin D supplementation and 25(OH)D concentrations have very few adverse side effects <sup>[6, 9]</sup>. It is also very inexpensive in markets that are not regulated, such as in the United States. Also, high 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with many health benefits <sup>[10]</sup> (see, also, information at VitaminDWiki.com and Grassrootshealth.net). On the anti side, physicians and health policy makers are reluctant to recommend health interventions that have not been rigorously tested and approved.

In my opinion, supplementation with substantial vitamin D doses is justified based on the enormous health and economic magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, the likely benefit in reducing risk of COVID-19 infection incidence and severity, and the preponderance of other health benefits from vitamin D supplementation and higher 25(OH)D concentrations with minimal adverse effects.

In terms of rolling out this recommendation, it is proposed that health care providers and first responders might try it first. Many of them lack adequate personal protective equipment and are contracting COVID-19 as a result. They have the training and motivation to lead the way in evaluating the benefit of vitamin D supplementation to help stem the COVID-19 pandemic. Measuring serum 25(OH)D concentrations at baseline and after supplementing for some time would be useful, especially in terms of evaluating the results in a field study rather than a randomized controlled trial <sup>[5]</sup>.
