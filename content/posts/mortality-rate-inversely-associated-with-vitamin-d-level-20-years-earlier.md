BACKGROUND AND AIMS:

In various populations, vitamin D deficiency is associated with chronic diseases and mortality. We examined the association between concentration of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, a marker of vitamin D status, and all-cause as well as cause-specific mortality.

METHODS AND RESULTS:

The study included 3404 participants of the general adult Swiss population, who were recruited between November 1988 and June 1989 and followed-up until the end of 2008. Circulating 25(OH)D was measured by protein-bound assay. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between 25(OH)D concentration and all-cause and cause-specific mortality adjusting for sex, age, season, diet, nationality, blood pressure, and smoking status. 

Per 10 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D concentration, all-cause mortality decreased by 20% (HR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.74-0.92). 

25(OH)D concentration was inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality in women (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.00 per 10 ng/mL increase),  **but not in men**  (HR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.77-1.23). 

In contrast, 25(OH)D concentration was inversely associated with cancer mortality in men (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.91 per 10 ng/mL increase), but not in women (HR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.93-1.39). Multivariate adjustment only slightly modified the 25(OH)D-mortality association.

CONCLUSION:

25(OH)D was similarly inversely related to all-cause mortality in men and women. 

However, we observed opposite effects in women and men with respect to cardiovascular and cancer mortality.

Probably the vitamin D tests were made 20 years before death, so could have little to do with the cause of death.

 **A whole lot can happen to vitamin D levels in 20 years** 

Can increase: example - Go on more sunny vacations

Can decrease: example - Become a shut-in (senior or nursing home)

Also – if people moved away they were probably not included in the study
