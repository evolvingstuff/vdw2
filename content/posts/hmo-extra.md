## This is extra material removed from [HMO main page](/tags/hmo-main-page.html)

[CLICK HERE](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/is-robotic-surgery-cheaper) for the article showing how Robotic surgery results in more income for hospitals.

## Article summary

Hospitals are using robotic assisted surgery even though it costs them **$3,000 more per surgery** . (cost includes maintenance, training and supplies)

75% of all radical prostate were done by robotic assisted surgeons in 2009 in the US.  

Following the money, it turns out that it the hospital makes money this way.  

The hospitals typically get a  **fixed amount of money for a of surgery** . 

Patients getting robotic assisted surgery get out of the hospital  **2 1/2 days earlier, and at $1500 per hospital day, the hospital makes money.** 

Increase cost =  **$3,000** , Decrease expenses = $3,750;  **Profit = $750 per surgery** 

AND, since the this surgery makes fewer errors there are fewer complications from the surgery, so again the hospital saves money.

Guess: net cost savings per surgery >$1,500

### Vitamin D ROI may be 1000X better than ROI for robotic surgery

Details on robotic assisted prostatectomy at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_prostatectomy)  

One of the robots - da Vinci- is currently used on  Bladder Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Coronary Artery Disease, Endometriosis, Gynecologic Cancer, Heavy Uterine Bleeding,  Kidney Disorders, Kidney Cancer, Mitral Valve Prolapse, Obesity, Prostate Cancer, Throat Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, Uterine Fibroids, and Uterine Prolapse

Also from wikipedia: Three major advances aided by surgical robots have been remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery. Some major advantages of robotic surgery are precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions, decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Further advantages are articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification, resulting in improved ergonomics.

## A long term benefit - can allude to it

People notice that HMO clients are healthier - so more join and more continue to stay with the HMO

That an employee smokes is based on the honor system

 **Wonder how much employers in the future will reduce health insurance cost to those getting adequate amount of vitamin D**

There have been many reports of reduced surgery complications when the patients had enough vitamin D (> 50 ng/ml). 

A hospital spending a few dollars for vitamin D should see an average payback of hundreds of dollars in reduced complications for some surgeries.  

All items  [After surgery or trauma in VitaminDWiki](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=64&sort_mode=created_desc)

There were reports of improved outcomes for bariatric, colon, hip, pancreatic, gastrointestinal, cardiac as well as many other surgeries.  

The routine practice of prescribing a single dose of 50,000 IU of vitamin D before surgery could be very beneficial.

Perhaps patients for some surgeries will get 150,000 IU during the weeks before their surgery.

While it would be far better if people would take enough vitamin D so as to not need many surgeries, this at least could be a start.

- - - - - - - - - 

## HMOs can save money vitamin D by:

1) reducing # of surgeries - which can be implied by many documents in VitaminDWiki, but not directly supported

2) reducing the recovery time from surgery - many studies which document this in VitaminDWiki,

3) reducing returns to the hospital after surgery 

4) reducing the number of times a client needs to see the doctor per year, which can be implied by many documents, but not directly supported (future)

* 2&3 would appear to require the least change to an HMO

* 2&3 Total cost of the surgery event would be less with vitamin D, but HMO would get the same income from Medicare (see robot above)

* 1&4 Get same income from employer, but can expect resistance from the HMO employees

## Encourage with recognition of doctors - say immediate points added to an annual recognition award

* Encourage with gift certificate to doctors

* Encourage with gift to charity in name of the doctor and/or patient ( e.g. March of Dimes, Breast Cancer Research ...)

* Encourage with gift certificate to patients (e.g. local pharmacy)

## Phase II

### Health Care provider groups should speed-up the vitamin D revolution/evolution

* Moving to higher percentage of the initial procedures which have been found to result in large ROI 

   * (higher fruit on the same tree)

* Extend the concept to new procedures

   * (low hanging fruit on other trees)

* And the ultimate goal - extending vitamin D supplementation so as to greatly reduce some of the procedures

   * is this providing nutrients to existing trees or planting new trees?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

### Low hanging fruit analogy for health care providers

1. Let them enjoy the low hanging fruit (see benefits of vitamin D to surgery)

1. Show them fruit on another tree

1. Show them how to use a ladder to get some higher hanging fruit

1. Show them how to prune the tree and add nutrients to get more fruit next year

1. Show them how to plant more trees.

## Provide positive feedback: to the health professionals ( doctor, oncologist, nurse, ....)

### Exploiting the experience of the Big Pharma - what actually has been proven to work

## Organization can give rewards to the doctors who try the 'drug'

* dinner

* gift

* give the doctor travel money to present a paper describing the pilot test

* give the doctor and his family a weekend time at a resort

## Give recognition

* Parking space of the month

* Immediately credit points toward annual recognition reward

* Award use of vitamin D in areas other than the specific procedures

## Other possibilities - some of which may be illegal, some of which Big Pharma could not do.

* give money

* give credit that can be applied to buying equipment for the doctor/department

* Extra day of vacation

* Give time off to write a paper/study

* Use of a Smartphone, iPad, electronic stethoscope, or other gadget

* Give vitamin D for a year

* Give a gift certificate

* Give a month of fitness center

* Give money to charity of Doctor's choice

## Can use use another feature developed by Big Pharma: <span style="color:#00F;">Have a Vitamin D detailer</span>

A vitamin D detailer go around to the doctors to 'talk up' the drug, answer questions, etc.

The detailer could also talk to the patient. The doctor would not have to know so much as to be able to convince his patients.

- - - - - - - - - - 

## Small business operators are starting to have a reason to keep their employees healthy

### This might provide a reason to promote vitamin D for their employees

In the past employees in small businesses were not paid for sick leave.

This meant that the waitress or nursing home employee would come to work sick rather than lose wages

Now some cities are starting to require  **<span style="color:#00F;">paid sick leave</span>**  for small businesses

## Fix vitamin D prior ?to surgery (love the title)

Delicia Yard, December 23, 2010

Nearly half of persons undergoing orthopedic surgery go into the operating room with deficient vitamin D levels — a condition that should be corrected ahead of time to improve outcomes.?

Internal-medicine specialists cleared 723 patients for elective orthopedic surgery to repair such conditions as distal radial or ulnar fracture of the hand, vertebral compression fracture, and knee or hip replacement. However, a retrospective chart review revealed that although 57% of the patients had normal vitamin D levels (?32 ng/mL), 28% had insufficient levels (<32 ng/mL) and the remaining ?15% were vitamin D-deficient (<20 ng/mL). ?

"Nearly half of the patients who were considered 'healthy' enough for surgery had significantly low levels of vitamin D, placing them at risk for poor bone healing, osteomalacia, or even secondary hyperparathyroidism in the most severe cases," observed the authors in a statement describing the findings.

The statement also noted that putting people on 2,000 to 4,000 mg of vitamin D (depending on their deficient value) could usually correct levels in four to six weeks. Very aggressive treatment right before surgery also can bring deficient vitamin D levels into the normal range.?

## Which sources of endorsements would best support our case?

Endorsements by vitamin D researchers

Endorsements by doctors who are pro-vitamin D

Endorsements by vitamin D research organizations (not just individuals)

Endorsements by vitamin D authors (some of whom are medical doctors)

Endorsements by researchers who have published articles on vitamin D and the specific procedure

Endorsements by doctors in the target organization (KP for example, now that we have found at at least KP doctor)

Form of the endorsement (want it to be easily stated - not require a lot of reading)

Example:

Fully supported by: 15 KP doctors, 5 vitamin D groups, 50 US doctors, 70 doctors outside of the US,....

Support, with reservations by  - - - - - - - - -

## This is the initial draft (Dec 2010) of an e-mail which will eventually go to vitamin D experts

Vitamin D should provide a HMOs a virtually instant 1000% return on investment

At VitaminDWiki we have been looking for a way to get vitamin D into widespread use.

We looked for those groups/organizations which can see immediately benefit from the use of vitamin D.

It appears that large health care providers have the most to gain,

so we are assembling a proposal to be given to a series of large health care providers. 

Will probably start with Kaiser Permanente, in the US.

Have the HMO experience the economic benefits of vitamin D

Start perhaps with just 1 out of every 10 of perhaps 5 different medical procedures. 

Supplement/Replete with vitamin D for 1 month before and 1 month after.

Permit opting-out by: doctor, patient, member of family, oncologist, anesthesiologist, …

of vitamin D supplementation of the procedure for any reason.

Significant immediate benefit

Most people and organizations will only believe something after they can see it

We have an initial list of 'low hanging fruit' medical procedures

which appear to provide at least one of the following economic benefits:

- Reduce by at least 1/2 hospital day on average

- Reduce by at least 1 rehabilitation/therapy days on average

- Reduce number of complications by 30%

## Not Rock the Boat

Will suggest that the HMO initially try dosage levels which are

compatible with current protocols and standards so as to not upset the medical staff:

- Repletion: frequent doses of 50,000 IU of vitamin D

- On-going 4,000 IU daily (pregnancy)

Will need your help with the initial list of procedures

We would like experts, such as yourself, to augment/refine/prioritize the initial list:

bariatric surgery, pregnancy, prostate surgery, thyroid surgery, kidney transplant,

bone procedures (back, broken bones, knee replacement, hip replacement), burns,

cancer (being careful to not have enhance the chemotherapy),

## Concerns to be addressed

Risks: such as patient law suits, doctor pushback.

There must be so little risk, so few concerns, that the proposal can easily understood by the gatekeepers, managers, and the board of directors.

Rewards: Return on Investment, retain current customers, gain new customers, stay ahead of the competition

## The Future

We feel that after an HMO experiences the economic benefits of vitamin D

that it will want to expand the trial to more of the same procedures and perhaps to other procedures as well. 

We hope, in the long term, that the HMO will have their clients take vitamin D on a regular basis,

which will eliminate some of the procedures, rather than just make them somewhat less costly.

---

## Notes from Dec 2010

After an HMO becomes vitamin D pro-active

1) People become healthier, so fewer procedures

2) Fewer doctors needed if HMO were to keep the same # of subscribers

3) However, more subscribers (people notice that people belonging to pro-active HMO are healthier)

HMO will have to have carefully timed marketing to keep number of health professionals balanced

Can share the (future) HMO/KP pitch for others to use

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Notes of Phone conversation Dect 2010

CEO's first concern is for risks, and then, if the risks are minimal, he can consider rewards

Risks: patient law suits, doctor pushback

Reward: Money to be saved, retain current customers, gain new customers, perhaps gain medical professionals

Propose a very small experiment: supplement with vitamin D before and after say 10% of just 5 types of surgeries.

Propose 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 twice per week for a month before and after the procedure/surgery

I have already compiled a list of 12 medical procedures which should be 'low hanging fruit' for KP

We should be able to have this proposed list reviewed by many vitamin D experts/doctors and narrow it down to say 5 procedures

Criteria: Expect to see a significant reduction in cost to KP by at least 1/2 of the surgeries

Significant = any of the following

- Reduce by one the number of days in the hospital for at least 50% of the procedures

- Reduce by at least 2 days any rehabilitation/therapy for at least 50% of the procedures

- Reduce number of procedures with complications by 30%

(Would like to have more than 14,000 IU per day (= 2 doses of 50,000 per week), but this amount = standard protocol)

The CEO must be give an a very easy case to present to his board of doctors.

There must be so little risk, so few concerns, that he can easily get it passed.

Most CEO's have gatekeepers - and at the size of KP there may be two levels of gatekeepers.

The gatekeeper's goal is to eliminate virtually all of the trash, and answer all of the easy questions.

As with the CEO, the gatekeeper must be able to understand what is being proposed in about 1 minute,

and be be given enough knowledge in 5 minutes to decided that KP needs to investigate this issue.

They can continue to test for vitamin D (The results of the test will rarely make any difference, but, aain there is no reason to upset them by changing policy)

I suggest that KP add-on testing for co-factors of vitamin D - to make sure that the patient remains balanced.

Co-factors: Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin K, and perhaps Vitamin A and Boron.

I will need to get doctors/researchers to endorse the need for vitamin D before and after procedures, and also test for co-factors.

This KP proposal can readily be presented to many hospital/HMOs/National Health Services around the world. (Blue Shield, Group Health, BUPA,.....)

They virtually always provide medical procedures at a fixed cost.

(It is a very rare medical provider which is allowed to bill, or can even understand how to bill, their real costs for each procedure.)

Additional possible CEO question: Why now.  Answer - to get ahead of the competition

Big money

Normally the big ROI is for Big Pharma

(From the book White Coat, Black Hat - my notes are attached

In the US there is 1 drug detailer for every 2.5 doctors

The Return on Investment to Big Pharma for having drug detailers is 10X)

We are proposing that ROI can/should also go to the Health Provider

ROI = 3X estimate is based on:

- No change of income per procedure (for a decade at least

- Average cost of supplementing with vitamin D - including tests for vitamin D and co-factors $1,000

- Average savings per procedure: $4,000, so net ROI = net savings/cost = ($4,000 savings - $1,000 cost)/$1,000 investment = 3X

To put this ROI in perspective:

US hospitals have mostly gone to having robotic-assisted prostate surgery even though it costs them $3,000 MORE per surgery

Because: the hospitals end up earning an extra $750 per surgery

ROI = 0.25X = $750net savings /$3000

Thus, vitamin D will give them 12X larger ROI

Other notes during phone conversation:

Standard Magnesium (Magnesium Oxide) is only 5% bio-available - I have just ordered for some Magnesium which is about 4X better

I have several PhD dissertations in Nutrition and Public Health which shine a very positive light on vitamin D.

Notes Dec 2010

Why should I want to read this?

Saving billions of dollars is not a reason

I need to have some reason to believe what you say

which can also be given to others - such as the Board of Directors, my doctors, etc.

Professor Lesley Rhodes (School of Translational Medicine, University of Manchester), Grant £153,065: Sunlight exposure and vitamin D status on children in the UK

Aim: Vitamin D is essential for children's bone health and may also protect against disease in later life. The aim of this project is to examine the proportion of UK schoolchildren with sufficient and optimal vitamin D status and see how this relates to their seasonal sunlight exposure levels and oral vitamin D intake.

Findings: Professor Rhodes' team will investigate how much sun exposure modern schoolchildren (aged between 12 and 14) are actually getting and how skin and dietary sources of vitamin D contribute to vitamin D status throughout the year. The children's vitamin D status will be assessed each season by taking blood samples. The children will also personally measure their ultraviolet radiation exposure using a specialised tool known as a dosimeter. Oral vitamin D intake will be recorded with questionnaires. The findings will inform the re-evaluation of current national guidelines related to recommended vitamin D levels, exposure to sunlight and vitamin D intake in children.

Patient benefit: The findings from this research will help to provide more informed advice on measures to be taken to increase the benefits of vitamin D in children, whilst minimising risks of skin cancer.

### BUPA URGES EVERYONE TO TAKE VITAMIN D TO REDUCE RISK OF CANCER - Dec 2009

As the winter solstice approaches, the shortest day of the year signals the start of winter when sunlight hours fall to an average of just two a day.1 Bupa, the UK's leading healthcare company is urging people to take Vitamin D to reduce their risk of cancer as day-time no longer means sun-time.

Vitamin D helps protect against certain cancers such as breast, bowel, prostate and colon. For people to obtain enough Vitamin D naturally, they need either to expose their skin to lots of summer sun or eat large quantities of oily fish. Bupa's assistant medical director, Dr Virginia Warren said: "Natural ways to get enough vitamin D aren't realistic because our skin cannot make vitamin D from winter sunlight in the UK as it is too weak. In the summer, people are rightly concerned about risks of skin cancer. And nobody wants to eat four tins of mackerel every day to get their vitamin D from oily fish."

Now, after analysing years of independent research,2 Bupa says the only alternative is to take Vitamin D supplements to reduce the chance of developing cancer by 26 percent.3 People need to take at least 1,500 - 2000 international units (IU) a day, which equates to 3-4 high strength capsules (12.5 micrograms/capsule).

Dr Warren continues: "People have to act now to take preventative measures against cancer for their future long-term health. The old-fashioned view was to take a low daily dose of Vitamin D for healthy bones. Cancer is today's biggest killer and we need to protect our bodies from it as much as we can. Taking Vitamin D supplements are an effective, inexpensive and easy way of doing that."
