 **Abstract does not indicate if the Cancers which result from living at very high altitudes for generations result in the same. more, or fewer death rates than cancer death rates from living at low altitude.**

Ecological studies have found that individuals that live at high altitude regions and in places where ultraviolet radiation is maximal, have lower rates of different types of cancer. However, there is evidence that in these same regions, genetic mutations that are prooncogenic, develop, as they are needed to **increase human adaptability to hypoxic environments** . Debate has arisen between researchers who consider high altitude environments as suitable for human longevity because of its protective effects against malignancies, and scientists that have reported an increased incidence of different type of cancers in these same regions. 

Evidence is presented that altitude is related to the development of genetic alterations in micro RNAs, p53 protein, lymphocyte activity, decrease in Fas Ligand and other proapoptotic molecules, as well as increase in prometastatic VGEF an HIF. Notwithstanding, higher vitamin D and ultraviolet B levels, and a better metabolic profile, taken together with lower pollution levels hves been related to lower incidence and mortality rates from malignancies in a series of epidemiological studies.
