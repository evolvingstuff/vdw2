# From [New Zealand Doctor](http://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/news/2012/february-2012/13/vit-d-testing-rarely-justified.aspx%20)

Testing for vitamin D status at $31 a pop is on the rise - but rarely justified.

Most patients at high risk of deficiency can be prescribed a supplement, or advised on safely getting more sun, without a test, New Zealand researchers suggest.

Those at high risk include people with deeply pigmented skin, the frail elderly, and people who actively avoid the sun for cultural or medical reasons, according to the authors of a viewpoint in the latest issue of the New Zealand Medical Journal (10 February online).

The article says the number of requested tests in the Auckland region grew by  **380 per cent between 2000 and 2010.** 

 **In the summer months, 13 tests may be needed to determine one case of deficiency.** 

## Test the right patients

Vitamin D measurements should arguably be requested only when the result is likely to change patient management, say the viewpoint's authors.

The few clear-cut cases include investigation of rickets or osteomalacia and other uncommon metabolic bone diseases, and hypocalcaemia.

The article says active, community-dwelling New Zealanders with regular sunlight exposure do not need vitamin D testing or supplements.

Tests may need to be restricted, which might reduce the number of testing sites to only the most accurate assay-providers, say the authors.

The authors include Auckland University medicine professors Ian Reid and Tim Cundy, and bone and joint senior research fellow Mark Bolland.
