Of that number, approximately three-quarters are women. The combined number of all osteoporosis-related fractures is greater than the incidence of heart attacks, strokes, and new breast cancer cases each year combined, and 90 percent are people age 65 and older.</p><p>Osteoporosis-related fractures were responsible for $19 billion in costs in 2005, a figure expected to rise to $25 million by 2025. About 5.3 million people over age 50 have osteoporosis at the femur and another 34.5 million have low bone mass, or osteopenia, experts report. After sustaining a fracture, these very high-risk individuals are usually not treated with calcium, vitamin D or a prescription medication for the prevention of future fracture, a major failing of the U.S. health care system.</p><p>&ldquo;Reducing the expected number of hip and other fractures by 20 percent by the end of the decade is a public health imperative,&rdquo; said Richard M. Dell, MD, lead orthopaedic surgeon, Healthy Bones Program, Kaiser Permanente. &ldquo;It would be a monumental achievement, sparing half a million Americans of horrible pain and suffering and a loss in quality of life—as well as producing enormous cost savings throughout the health care system. The time to act is now as a growing number of Americans are reaching the age where hip and other osteoporosis-related fractures are common but are still preventable in many cases.”</p><p>Representatives of a number of groups—leading physicians and experts in bone health and fracture prevention—shared best practices and laid out a plan to achieve this nationwide goal. A key element is a proposal to establish a fracture liaison service facilitated by NBHA within Medicare and other health systems modeled on successful programs that currently exist in the United States at Kaiser Permanente, Geisinger Health System the American Orthopaedic Association and the Department of Veterans Affairs as well as internationally in the United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere. The service would assess patients who suffer a fracture for osteoporosis and, if found, provide them treatment and follow-up to manage the disease in an effort to prevent repeat fractures.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the NBHA&rsquo;s major priorities is the implementation of this successful fracture liaison service model in a number of health systems, including the Medicare population,&rdquo; said Sundeep Khosla, MD, Mayo Clinic and chairman, NBHA Governance Committee. &ldquo;This model has been shown in a number of countries and health care settings to not only decrease health care expenditures but also reduce the number of subsequent fractures which, in this high-risk population, can cause significant mortality and morbidity.”</p><p>The <strong>Kaiser Permanente&rsquo;s Healthy Bones Program</strong> has successfully reduced hip fracture rates by more than 37 percent, according to published research. If this program were implemented nationally, it would prevent more than 100,000 fractures and save the health care system more than $5 billion annually.</p><p>Also discussed was the American Orthopaedic Association&rsquo;s <strong>Own the Bone Program</strong> , a quality improvement initiative introduced in the open health care system that addresses the need to assess and treat patients age 50 and over with osteoporotic fractures and promotes coordination of care between specialties. Own the Bone has touched more than 3,000 patients in 31 states and continues to grow rapidly.</p><p>&ldquo;While as orthopaedic surgeons we are the initial treating physicians for fracture patients, we know that a multi-specialty approach is required to ensure appropriate treatment of patients to prevent repeat fractures and that working together we can positively impact the assessment and treatment of patients with osteoporosis,&rdquo; said Douglas R. Dirschl, MD, president of the American Orthopaedic Association.</p><p>Robert A. Adler, MD, Richmond Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, described an osteoporosis disease-management process as part of the Veterans Affairs Patient-Aligned Care Team program. &ldquo;Veterans Affairs pharmacists can use the electronic medical record to identify patients at highest risk for osteoporotic fracture, particularly those who have already suffered a fragility fracture,&rdquo; Adler said.</p><p>&ldquo;We know this can be done,&rdquo; said Robert M. Pearl, MD, chief executive officer of The Permanente Medical Group and the Mid-Atlantic Permanente Medical Group. &ldquo;The combination of our Kaiser Permanente integrated care delivery system and 21st century technology has allowed us to dramatically lower the mortality from cardiovascular disease, sepsis and cancer. Now we can apply the same approaches to improving osteoporosis outcomes and decreasing the frequency of hip and other bone fractures.”</p><p>Also presenting at this summit were Robert Lindsay, MD, PhD, Helen Hayes Hospital, Columbia University and NBHA Executive Committee; David B. Lee, MPA, NBHA; and Paul J. Mitchell, BSc (hons), CChem MRSC, Synthesis Medical Limited and University of Derby, U.K.</p><p>More than 100 attendees participated in the event – half of them attending in person at the Center for Total Health and half via web conference. Dozens of participants signed a placard pledging their commitment to reaching the goal of 20 percent reduction in hip and other fractures by 2020.</p><h3 id=about-kaiser-permanente>About Kaiser Permanente</h3><p>Kaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape the future of health care.
