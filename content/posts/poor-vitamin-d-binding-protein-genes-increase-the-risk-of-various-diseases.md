#### rs7041 and rs4588 Polymorphisms in Vitamin D Binding Protein Gene (VDBP) and the Risk of Diseases

Int J Mol Sci. 2022 Jan 15;23(2):933. [doi: 10.3390/ijms23020933.](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23020933.)

The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP, DBP) and its polymorphism in the vitamin D pathway and human health. This narrative review shows the latest literature on the most popular diseases that have previously been linked to VDBP. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in human metabolism, controlling phosphorus and calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D binding protein bonds vitamin D and its metabolites and transports them to target tissues. The most common polymorphisms in the VDBP gene are rs4588 and rs7041, which are located in exon 11 in domain III of the VDBP gene. rs4588 and rs7041 may be correlated with differences not only in vitamin D status in serum but also with vitamin D metabolites. This review supports the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDBP gene and presents the latest data showing correlations between VDBP variants with important human diseases such as 

* obesity, 

* diabetes mellitus, 

* tuberculosis, 

* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 

* and others.

In this review, we aim to systematize the knowledge regarding the occurrence of diseases and their relationship with vitamin D deficiencies, which may be caused by polymorphisms in the VDBP gene. Further research is required on the possible influence of SNPs, modifications in the structure of the binding protein, and their influence on the organism. It is also important to mention that most studies do not have a specific time of year to measure accurate vitamin D metabolite levels, which can be misleading in conclusions due to the seasonal nature of vitamin D.
