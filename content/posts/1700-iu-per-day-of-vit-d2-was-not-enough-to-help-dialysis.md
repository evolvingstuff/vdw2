# Vitamin D Supplementation Does Not Affect Haemoglobin Levels in Patients on Haemodialysis: Presented at NKF

ORLANDO, Fla -- April 20, 2010 -- Ergocalciferol (VD2) supplementation in deficient patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on haemodialysis does not improve levels of anaemia, nor does it decrease the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), researchers said here at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) 2010 Spring Clinical Meetings.

Shankha Nandi, MD, Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, reported the findings on April 15.

The researchers found that patients who did respond to vitamin D supplementation did not show significant statistical improvement.

The group examined a study cohort of 126 patients with ESRD on haemodialysis to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on anaemia or mean monthly dose of EPO.

Patients deficient in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) received 50,000 IU of VD2 treatment weekly for 1 month, resulting in the administration of 4 doses in that month. They then received 3 more doses of  **50,000 IU, 1 each month**   for the next 3 months. Patients with baseline levels between 10 and 30 pg/mL received 50,000 IU once a month for 4 months.

Of the 126 patients that started out in the study, 36 were determined to be responders to VD2 treatment, meaning that they achieved final 25(OH)D levels >=30 pg/mL, while 45 were determined to be nonresponders, meaning that their 25(OH)D levels did not achieve adequate changes. This led to a final study group of 81.

The researchers did not observe a statistically significant decrease in mean EPO dose during the follow-up periods between the responder and nonresponder groups. The same proved true for haemoglobin levels for both the responders and nonresponders.

The group had hoped to confirm that vitamin D supplementation can reduce haemoglobin levels and necessary monthly EPO dosages in HD patients, but they were unable to show significant changes in either.
