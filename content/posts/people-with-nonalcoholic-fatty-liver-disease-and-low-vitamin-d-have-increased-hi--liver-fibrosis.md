#### Low vitamin D does not cause NAFLD - Feb 2018

 **Vitamin D and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Bi-directional Mendelian Randomization Analysis** 

 **Results** 

An SD increase in the 25(OH)D GRS was significantly associated with 25(OH)D (β 1.29, 95%CI − 1.54, − 1.04, P < 0.05) but not with NAFLD (OR 0.97, 95%CI 0.92, 1.01). An SD increase in NAFLD GRS was also strongly associated with NAFLD (OR 1.09, 95%CI 1.04, 1.15, P < 0.05) but not with 25(OH)D (β − 0.15, 95%CI − 0.41, 0.10). Using an instrumental variable estimator, no associations were found for genetically instrumented 25(OH)D with NAFLD and for genetically instrumented NAFLD with 25(OH)D.
