#### Decreased Vitamin D is just one of many possible reasons for 50X increase in Canine Cancer

* Dog leash laws established in many US cities about 50 years ago

* Dogs rarely get outdoors in the middle of the day (when Vitamin D can be generated by the sun)

* Increased use of lawn herbicides

* Introduction of GMO/Roundup in both canine and human food

   * Roundup has been associated with many human diseases

* Decreased Vitamin D in dog food 

   * fewer table scraps

   * less D in the scraps

   * decreased feeding of organ meats to dogs (which had a lot of Vitamin D)
