J Chin Med Assoc. 2021 Nov 1;84(11):1054-1059. [doi: 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000607.](https://doi.org/10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000607.)

Background: Most reproductive system studies suggest the protective effects of vitamin D, but vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are growing global health issues. The present study investigates the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and gynecologic diseases to identify illness risks at different serum vitamin D levels in Taiwan.

Methods: A total of 7699 female adults aged â‰¥20 years with results for both serum vitamin D and gynecologic-associated diseases were drawn from the Taiwan MJ cohort. We analyzed the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and results from reproductive system evaluations, including history of dysmenorrhea, results of Pap smear, high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix, mammography, and ultrasound of breast and pelvis.

Results: Over 80% of participants showed vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. Participants with 

* abnormal Pap smear results, 

* high-risk HPV infection, and 

(history of dysmenorrhea 

showed significantly lower levels of serum vitamin D (p < 0.001-0.05). 

Serum vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with 

* positive high-risk HPV infection of the cervix (p < 0.05) and 

* dysmenorrhea (p < 0.001). 

After controlling for age as a confounding variable for each gynecologic disease, level of serum vitamin D was significantly associated with 

* abnormal breast ultrasound (odds ratio = 0.724) and 

* uterus ultrasound (odds ratio = 0.673 - 0.8), and 

* dysmenorrhea (odds ratio = 0.829).

Conclusion: Associations were found between vitamin D deficiency and endometriosis, uterine myoma, dysmenorrhea, abnormal Pap smear results, and high-risk HPV infection of the cervix. Therefore, vitamin D supplements may present a cost-effective benefit for the prevention and treatment of gynecologic diseases, and thus reduction of healthcare expenditures.
