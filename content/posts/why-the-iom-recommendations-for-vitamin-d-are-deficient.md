### The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail in a major way on logic, on science, and on effective public health guidance.

### Moreover, by failing to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach constitutes precisely the wrong model for development of nutritional policy.

## Introduction

In the past two years, vitamin D supplement sales to consumers have increased by more than 100% per year.(1)  Now, following publication of the report (2) on Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for  calcium  and  vitamin  D  by  the  Institute  of  Medicine  (IOM), many physicians report that they are decreasing their vitamin D recommendations   to   patients.   This   change   was   explicitly proposed by members of the IOM panel in their various media statements. While a small fraction of consumers may well have all the  vitamin  D  they  need,  on  balance,  we  consider  a  general downward trend to be harmful to the health of the public.

 **Both  the  authors  of  this  Perspective  served  as  members  of the panel that drafted the 1997 report of the IOM**  on the DRIs for calcium and vitamin  D. That  report  was the first  issued by the  IOM  under  the  then-new  evidence-based  guidelines  for evaluating studies and making recommendations. We are thus familiar with the process and, most important,  with vitamin D itself.  On  the  basis  of  this  experience,  we  respectfully  dissent from many of the findings and recommendations in the current report, and we set forth here a small fraction of the reasons for that dissent.

The IOM report (and its presentation to the media) stressed that  its  recommendations  for  vitamin  D  were  based  primarily on the  intake (and  serum 25-hydroxyvitamin  D concentration) needed  to  ensure  skeletal  health  and  that,  in  the  panel’s judgment,   there   was   insufficient   evidence   to   make   any recommendations  with  respect  to  nonskeletal  benefits,  if  any. Second,   the   report   concluded   that   a   serum   level   for   25- hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> of 20 ng/mL was sufficient to ensure bone health. And third, the panel concluded that since the bulk of  the  American  public  had  25(OH)D  values  that  were  above 20 ng/mL, most individuals were getting all the vitamin D they needed and had no reason for further supplementation. These conclusions fail on three grounds: logic, science, and guidance.

 **First, logic** . Since the panel, in its judgment, concluded that it  **did not know whether there might be nonskeletal benefits**  (or at what  blood  level  they  could  be  ensured),  then  it  is   **patently incorrect to say that they know that people are getting enough** . The most the panel could have said logically was, ‘‘Here’s what you need for bone; most people get that much; we do not know whether more would confer possible nonskeletal benefits.’’ That, at least, would have been an honest communication of the state of the issue as the panel apparently understands it. However, to state publicly that the general public does not need more goes well beyond what the panel admits it knows.

 **Second,  science** .  The  statement  that  skeletal  health  can  be ensured at serum 25(OH)D levels of  **20 ng/mL is simply incorrect** . Without  going  into  an  exhaustive  recital  of  all  the  evidence pointing  to  a  skeletal  need  for  higher  levels,  we  cite  here three illustrative observations that, in our collective judgment, indicate that instead of 20 ng/mL, a serum level of 30 ng/mL is closer  to  the  bottom  end  of  the  acceptable  range  for  skeletal health. First, there is the large randomized, controlled trial in the United  Kingdom  that   **raised  serum  25(OH)D  level  from  21  to 29 ng/mL  and  produced  a  33%  reduction**   in  all  major  osteo- porotic fractures combined.(3)  The fact that other trials, with less good  compliance,  failed  to  reproduce  that  effect  does  not negate the evidence of a well-conducted trial. Second, there are the  many  meta-analyses  of  Bischoff-Ferrari  and  colleagues(4,5) demonstrating   that,   taken   overall,   fracture   reduction   with vitamin  D  does  not  occur  reproducibly  below  serum  25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL and for some fractures even 40 ng/mL. Finally, there  is  the  demonstration,  in  a  large  German  autopsy  series (strangely  misinterpreted  by  the  panel),  that  osteoid  seam width—the histologic hallmark of vitamin D deficiency—does not  reach  fully  normal  values  until  serum  25(OH)D  levels  are above  30 ng/mL.(6)   [N.B.:  Of  33  patients  with  25(OH)D  values between  20  and  30 ng/mL,  more  than  half  (18)  had  elevated osteoid  volume.  A  Recommended  Daily  Allowance  (RDA),  by definition,  meets  the  need  of  97.5%  of  the  population.](N.B.:%20%20Of%20%2033%20%20patients%20%20with%20%2025(OH)D%20%20values%20between%20%2020%20%20and%20%2030%20ng/mL,%20%20more%20%20than%20%20half%20%20(18)%20%20had%20%20elevated%20osteoid%20%20volume.%20%20A%20%20Recommended%20%20Daily%20%20Allowance%20%20(RDA),%20%20by%20definition,%20%20meets%20%20the%20%20need%20%20of%20%2097.5%%20%20of%20%20the%20%20population.)  In  a closely  related  finding,  investigators  from  South  Australia(7) showed seasonal variation  in osteoid seam width and mineral appositional   rate,   reflecting   variations   in   serum   25(OH)D precisely  within  the  20  to  30 ng/mL  range,  that  is,  above  the IOM panel’s ‘‘adequate’’ level.

Additionally, there is an  **apparent inconsistency**  between the recommended intake (600 IU/day for all individuals up through age 70) and the bottom end of the acceptable 25(OH)D serum concentration   range   (let   alone   higher   values).   As   virtually universal  experience  with  vitamin  D  supplementation  demonstrates,  **600 IU/day, if the body’s sole input of vitamin D, would not be enough to produce a value of even 10 ng/mL** , let alone 20 ng/mL  or  above.  There  is  a  generally  recognized  ‘‘rule  of thumb’’ to the effect that each additional 100 IU of vitamin D per day raises serum 25(OH)D concentration by approximately 1 ng/mL.  That  is,  in  fact,  a  ‘‘rounding  up’’  for  convenience  of calculation. Several studies indicate that the response increment is closer to 0.7 ng/mL/100 IU.(8,9)  Either way, 600 IU/day will not suffice without appreciable solar and dietary input. Furthermore, as   is   also   widely   recognized,    **600   IU/day   produces   barely perceptible changes in individuals who are overweight or obese** (now  better  than  50%  of  the  US  adult  population).  Hence  the increase from the 1997 DRIs, while welcome, and certainly in the right direction, is simply inconsistent with current professional experience. It not only is inadequate, by itself, to meet even the panel’s  recommended  serum  levels,  but  this  internal  incon-sistency   detracts   from   the   credibility   of   the   whole   report inasmuch  as  it  flies  in  the  face  of  the  everyday  experience  of clinicians  who  recommend  supplements  to  their  patients  and measure the resulting responses.

 **Finally, guidance** . At already noted, the panel indicated that it was   uncertain   about   extraskeletal   benefits—benefits   that might accrue at intakes above the new intake recommendations. At the same time, the panel raised the upper-level intake ‘‘TUIL’’ to  4000  IU/day.  (The  report  acknowledges  that  intakes  up  to 10,000  IU/day  are  probably  safe  for  everyone  and  applied  an uncertainty  factor(10)   to  that  10,000-IU  figure  to  generate  the 4000-IU TUIL. It is important to stress that the TUIL is not a limit but instead constitutes an assurance of safety for such an intake.) One  should  have  thought  that  even  a  very  simplistic  game- theory approach would have led to a guidance statement such as  the  following:  ‘‘We  do  not  know  whether  taking  more vitamin D than we are currently recommending will help you, but it could, and we can assure you that supplemental intakes up to at  least  4000  IU/day  are  safe.’’  Such  a  statement,  couched, perhaps,  in  less  straightforward  language,  nevertheless  would provide   guidance   that   both   the   public   and   governmental agencies could find useful. Instead, we now have only a confused public.

Beyond  these  errors  and  inconsistencies,  though,  serious  as they are, lies a  **much deeper flaw**  in the approach taken by the panel, exemplified by a quote from one of the panel members to the New York Times at the time of release of the report.(11)  The statement was simply that the ‘‘onus’’ (ie, burden of proof) fell on anyone who claimed benefits for intakes higher than the panel’s current  recommendations.  This  is  an  approach  that  is  correct for  drugs,  which are foreign  chemicals  and which do  carry  an appropriately   heavy   requirement   for   proof.   For   drugs,   the position of privilege is given to the placebo. And in the current IOM report, the privilege is given to a serum 25(OH)D level that is effectively the status quo. We judge that this is exactly backward for nutrients. The privilege instead must be given to the  **intake that  prevailed  during  the  evolution  of  human  physiology** ,  the intake  to which,  presumably,  that  physiology  is fine-tuned.  So far as can be judged from numerous studies documenting the magnitude  of  the  effect  of  sun  exposure,(12,13)   the   **primitive intake would have been at least 4000 IU/day and probably two to three times that level, with corresponding serum 25(OH)D levels ranging from 40 to 80 ng/mL** . The fact that primitive levels would have been higher than current IOM recommendations does not, of course, prove their necessity today. But such intakes should be given the presumption of correctness, and the burden of proof must be placed on those who propose that lower intakes (and lower serum levels) are without risk of preventable dysfunction or disease. The IOM, in its report, has utterly failed to recognize or meet that standard.

Finally, we commend the IOM panel for their concern about safety, certainly an appropriate posture for a body crafting public policy. However, the standards adopted by the panel for taking into  evidence  papers  indicating  possible  risk  were,  we  note, far  lower  than  those  the  panel  required  to  indicate  benefit. Additionally,  many  of  the  purported  risks  were,  on  their  face, implausible and inconsistent with the experience of population subgroups   that   routinely   have   serum   levels   in   the   range mentioned  by  the  panel  as  possibly  risky  (eg,  approximately 50 ng/mL).  We  note  that  one  of  the  widely  accepted  Hill(14) criteria for acceptance of observational data is precisely biologic plausibility. Furthermore, we consider it highly implausible that serum levels such as prevailed during hominid evolution could carry more risk than benefit for the populations concerned. Had that  been  the  case,  one  should  have  expected  that  natural selection would have eliminated those prone to such risks.

In  this  Perspective,  we  have  deliberately  avoided  a  mindnumbing laundry list of the vast number of factual inaccuracies and misinterpretations in the report. We are informed that there is a request, through the Freedom of Information Act, to obtain the external review comments submitted to the IOM in response to   a   prepublication   draft.   When   those   materials   become available, those interested can review the many problems with the IOM report in detail. For now, our recommendation to the American public is that the IOM report should be taken with a grain of salt (another nutrient the IOM finds risky).
