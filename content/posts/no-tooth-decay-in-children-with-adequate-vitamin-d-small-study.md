AIM:

To compare the levels of vitamin D in children with severe early childhood caries (SECC) and children without caries and to determine the association of vitamin D deficiency and SECC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

A total of 30 children each from case (with caries) and control group (without caries) of age between 3 and 6 years were selected from the Department of Pedo-dontics and Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dental Sciences, SGT University, Gurugram. Caries status of the children was recorded using  **decayed, extracted, and filled teeth (deft) index.**  Blood samples for serum 25(OH) vitamin D were taken from each child. All the data collected were compiled and subjected to appropriate statistical analysis.

RESULTS:

Case group has mean serum 25(OH) vitamin D level of 12.19 ng/mL <span>[4.37 standard deviation (SD), 95% confidence interval of 10.5-13.8]</span> and control group has mean serum 25(OH) vitamin D level of 20.11 ng/mL (4.12 SD, 95% confidence interval of 18.56-21.65). When the mean levels of serum 25(OH) vitamin D were compared between case and control groups, there was a statistically significant difference (p-value <0.0001). Simple linear regression in case group shows statistically significant inverse correlation between vitamin D levels and SECC (p-value<0.0001).

CONCLUSION:

Our results showed that vitamin D deficiency is risk factor both for incidence of dental caries and for its severity in children.

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:

Vitamin D deficiency is an important modifiable risk factor for dental caries in children. Hence, by supplementing vitamin D in children and preventing the deficiency of vitamin D, dental caries can be prevented.
