We are going to get started. Thank you for coming to another week of Capitol Clarity. We&rsquo;re so happy you guys could make it. We have a guest speaker today, Dr. Ryan Cole. He is the CEO and medical&mldr;</p><p>0:00:16.7 Dr. Ryan Cole: Medical director.</p><p>0:00:18.5 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Yes, of Cole Diagnostics. He is going to talk about a whole host of topics, coronavirus obviously, and vaccines and outpatient treatment, and we are really excited to have him here and get some information from him.</p><p><span>[applause]</span></p><p>0:00:40.1 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> I appreciate the applause. You don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve said yet, so hopefully there will still be some at the end. <span>[laughter]</span> Yeah, Dr. Ryan Cole. I run Cole Diagnostics. It&rsquo;s one of the largest independent laboratories in the State of Idaho, and started it 17 years ago. I&rsquo;m a Mayo Clinic-trained, board-certified pathologist. Board-certified in Anatomic and Clinical Pathology. So, yes, I have expertise in immunology and virology. I also have subspecialty expertise in skin pathology, so I do a lot of skin cancer diagnostics as well. I&rsquo;ve seen about 350,000 patients in my career. We&rsquo;ve done about 100,000 COVID tests in the past year, so it is right up my alley. And so I&rsquo;m not just blowing smoke today, this is my area of expertise. I wanna be able to share with you today actual science. We get a lot of politics from one side, the other side. I&rsquo;m not here to offend one side or the other. I&rsquo;m here to speak data, and the data speaks the truth. I have no agenda, I just want people to understand what public health messages that we&rsquo;ve been missing, what treatment should be available to everybody.</p><p>0:01:45.7 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> I wanna talk a little bit about the &ldquo;vaccines,&rdquo; and then I wanna open it up to questions, &lsquo;cause I could talk on this for probably three hours or three weeks. I&rsquo;ve only read maybe 6000 articles in the last year. I&rsquo;ve only seen, like I said, 100,000 patients. So, hopefully buckle up and something useful. If one person walks away and I help save a life, then I&rsquo;ve accomplished my purpose here today, so thank you for the opportunity. Thank you to my friend, Craig, in the back. I know he&rsquo;s got some handouts, if some people are interested as well, so thanks for inviting me. And thanks to Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s Office as well, I&rsquo;m honored to be here. All right. Dustin, my friend, let&rsquo;s advance here and we shall proceed. He&rsquo;s the man with the magical buttons. Yeah, go to the next slide there if you could, please.</p><p>0:02:35.1 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Oh, it&rsquo;s right there. This is where we are right now. Does that look like a pandemic? It was. It&rsquo;s not anymore. We&rsquo;re in an endemic now. Statistically, the pandemic is over in Idaho. Statistically, once we&rsquo;re below a set percentage, we are not in a pandemic right now. Is the disease present? Sure, it is. Is it widespread? No. We&rsquo;re still doing maybe 500 to 600 patient tests a day. At most, we&rsquo;re seeing 2% per day right now, and so the numbers are going way down. Next slide, please.</p><p><span>[background conversation]</span></p><p>0:03:18.4 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Yeah, we are past the pandemic stage. We are in an endemic stage, and most states we are. The numbers are still high in a few states, but we&rsquo;re getting past that point, and here&rsquo;s why. Coronaviruses are seasonal. They follow a six to nine-month life cycle, and no matter what we do, they&rsquo;re gonna do what they do and then they&rsquo;re going to fade. What happened to SARS? What happened to MERS? What did we do to stop them? Nothing. They did their thing. Average COVID-19 death age, 78.6. Average age of death in North America every year, 78.6. That&rsquo;s fascinating.</p><p><span>[laughter]</span></p><p>0:03:51.5 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> What are our highest risk factors? Obesity, low <strong>vitamin d</strong> levels, advanced age. 90% of deaths in the state have been over 70 years of age. That&rsquo;s the out-risk population. We have stopped our society for something that&rsquo;s taking people that are already at that death risk age anyway. The virus is fragile. These are just little tidbits. It&rsquo;s fragile. It doesn&rsquo;t live outside. UV light fractionates it, kills it, blows it apart, ventilation and the wind blows it away. It is insanity to wear a mask outside. It is absolute insanity.</p><p><span>[applause]</span></p><p>0:04:28.1 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> And that&rsquo;s science. That&rsquo;s science. There is not one study that has shown any super spreader event to have occurred outside. They have all been indoors with poor ventilation. Next slide, please. All right. Biggest lost message on this entire pandemic is <strong>vitamin d</strong> . There is no such thing. And if that can give one message to all of you, for every winter and autumn for the rest of your lives, there is no such thing as flu and cold season. There is only low <strong>vitamin d</strong> season. Next please. <strong>vitamin d</strong> . Every cell in your body, every nucleus has a receptor for <strong>vitamin d</strong> on it. Two thousand genes in your body are controlled by <strong>vitamin d</strong> , 5% of your body&rsquo;s genome controlled by <strong>vitamin d</strong> . It is the master key to your immune system, the master key. If one has a level in mid-range, you cannot develop a cytokine storm. Data shows what kills people, cytokine storm. If you are in mid-level range, you will not die from COVID &lsquo;cause you cannot get a cytokine storm. Next please.</p><p>0:05:26.8 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> All right. We don&rsquo;t just have a viral pandemic, we have an international <strong>vitamin d</strong> deficiency pandemic, ie, 70% of the world is immune-suppressed, 70%. Seventy to 80% of all Americans are immune-suppressed because they are D-deficient. 82% to 88% of nursing home patients are D-deficient. Who&rsquo;s dying at the highest rate? Nursing home patients. Eighty-three percent of African Americans, 70% of Latinos, 72% of Native Americans, 47% of Caucasians are insufficient&mldr; Or are deficient. Well, 47% are deficient, 70% of Caucasians are insufficient. Eighty percent of all hospitalized patients statistically are <strong>vitamin d</strong> -deficient. Ninety-six percent of people in the ICU are <strong>vitamin d</strong> -deficient. If you are D-deficient, you are immune-suppressed. You are susceptible to the common cold, the flu, coronavirus of any sort, bacterial pneumonia, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p><p>0:06:27.5 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> The best mask of all is a healthy immune system, and a healthy immune system does not occur, next slide, please, if you don&rsquo;t have D in normal range. Well, how do we get D? Sunshine. We synthesize it through our skin. Above the 35th parallel in the world or below the 35th parallel for four to five months of the year, you cannot synthesize <strong>vitamin d</strong> through your skin. The older you get, the harder it becomes as well. <strong>vitamin d</strong> is critical. Every Idahoan, if you do not supplement, you are <strong>vitamin d</strong> -deficient, you are immune-suppressed in the fall, on the winter. Next slide, please. Here&rsquo;s a good map of the 35th parallel, anybody above that line is vitamin-D deficient all winter long. Next slide, please.</p><p><span>[laughter]</span></p><p>0:07:16.5 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> You can run outside naked thinking you&rsquo;re getting sunshine from October through March, like this fine gentleman here in the snow, and the amount of <strong>vitamin d</strong> you will synthesize from October through March outdoors, running naked in your tutu, is zero, absolutely zero. If you do not supplement with <strong>vitamin d</strong> in the winter time, you are immune-suppressed. Next, please, most insurance companies in Idaho and northern states do not pay for a <strong>vitamin d</strong> test, unfortunately. Other countries, Scandinavians, test their citizens twice a year, they supplement 35 foods on their food shelves with <strong>vitamin d</strong> . Why is Finland, Norway, Sweden doing so well? They take care of the public health of their individuals. They know that this is public health message number one for their immune health, so they do something about it.</p><p>0:08:01.8 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Eighty percent of Americans also are magnesium-deficient, our soils are depleted. <strong>vitamin d</strong> and magnesium play a fine dance, you need them both to work together in order to have a functional immune system. We&rsquo;re also zinc-deficient, 70% to 80% of us in this room. Diet, diet, diet, diet. What you eat matters, it affects your immune health. Obesity drastically reduces your ability to get <strong>vitamin d</strong> into your circulation. D is a fat-soluble vitamin, the heavier set you are, the more it goes into your fat and not into your circulation to stimulate your immune system. Normal D levels also decrease colon cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer rates, depression rates, suicide rates. Eight of the 10 higher suicide states are northern-tiered states, go figure, &lsquo;cause <strong>vitamin d</strong> , it&rsquo;s not a vitamin, it&rsquo;s a pro-hormone, and again, it affects thousands of genes in your body. You get a D level up to normal, you decrease risk for all of these things, not just COVID. Next please.</p><p>0:08:58.6 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> All right. Most physicians, unfortunately, don&rsquo;t know how critical this is. This should be public health message from the pulpits of Washington, the pulpits of every state, where we&rsquo;re pulling our hair, &ldquo;Henny Penny, the sky is falling,&rdquo; oh no, oh no. What really matters is, look, if you have a healthy immune system, you have a healthy population. And we are not emphasizing that. It&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Oh gosh, masks, distancing, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do.&rdquo; There is something we can do, give the right message. And the right message is you can take control of your immune health, you can do something about it. What goes into your body does matter.</p><p>0:09:33.3 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Public health officials have ignored this critical message. Normal D levels decrease your COVID symptom severity risk for hospitalization by 90%. That&rsquo;s the world data now. There have been a lot of placebo-controlled trials that show this all around the world. It is scientific fact, not just a correlation like a lot of doctors will tell, &ldquo;Oh, gosh, that&rsquo;s that vitamin stuff.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s an essential part of the human body.&rdquo; It is an essential pro-hormone that your body naturally makes in the sunshine from spring through summer only a couple hours a day. We can get into that later if there&rsquo;s questions, &lsquo;cause there&rsquo;s only about a three-hour window a day without your sunscreen. Don&rsquo;t tell all the dermatologists that I serve, you need to be outside for 20-30 minutes during the spring and summer to get natural <strong>vitamin d</strong> . In the fall, in the winter, you need to supplement to boost your immune system.</p><h4 id=darked-skin--less-vitamin-d--less-health>Darked Skin ==&#187; less Vitamin D ==> less health</h4><p>0:10:20.3 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> The darker your skin, the further north you live, the harder it is to synthesize <strong>vitamin d</strong> . That&rsquo;s why the hospitalization and the death rates in the darker-skinned populations, it is not social disparity, it&rsquo;s just plain and simple biology. It is biology. The darker your skin, the further north you live, the lower your <strong>vitamin d</strong> level, the higher your risk for COVID and all other illnesses. I understand there are some social disparities in our society, and we can&rsquo;t fix that right away, but I hope we&rsquo;re working on it. But the biology of the disease is the darker you live, further from the equator, the less <strong>vitamin d</strong> you synthesize, the more immune-suppressed you are. There is a cool little app called&mldr; And the RDA, the recommended daily allowance, that was after World War II to sustain basic life. <strong>The amount that they give there is like a drop of water in the ocean that they recommend. It is nonsense, absolute nonsense</strong> . There&rsquo;s a cool app, it&rsquo;s called D Minder, and it shows you when you can synthesize your <strong>vitamin d</strong> . Next slide, please.</p><h4 id=dr-fauci-takes-8000-9000-ius-daily-in-winter>Dr. Fauci takes 8000-9000 IUs daily in winter</h4><p>0:11:18.4 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Our esteemed Dr. Fauci said in an interview in November, &ldquo;Well, gosh, <strong>I take 8000-9000 units of vitamin d a day</strong> in the winter.&rdquo; Yet inexplicably, that&rsquo;s not a public health message. In a little side interview, I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Well, gosh, you know it, you know it affects your immune health. You work for the government and have been in there for 40 years, make that a message to everybody, please.&rdquo; Okay. Next.</p><h4 id=what-should-public-health-message-number-one-two-and-three-be-span-stylecolorf00vitamin-d-vitamin-d-vitamin-dspan>What should public health message number one, two and three be? <span style=color:red>vitamin d, vitamin d, vitamin d</span></h4><p>0:11:41.8 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> All right. <strong>What should public health message number one, two and three be? vitamin d vitamin d, vitamin d</strong> . Number four, decrease societal obesity, cut out the sugar, cut out the processed foods, cut out the carbohydrates. Those are all inflammatory. The more inflamed you are going into an illness, the worse you will do. Obesity is a predisposed inflammatory state. If you are obese, you are inflamed. I don&rsquo;t say that to offend anybody, but <strong>I lost 45 pounds eight years ago, I&rsquo;ve kept it off</strong> . Ask me later about that, but it contributes to countless diseases. Next, please.</p><ul><li>Note: The founder of VitaminDWiki lost 50 lbs 30 years and kept it off (not due to Vitamin D)</li></ul><p>0:12:13.0 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> All right. Is there a treatment for outpatient COVID? Is there a treatment? Unfortunately, the three-letter federal government agencies have practiced therapeutic nihilism, apathy, complete apathy. &ldquo;No, gosh. If you get sick, go home. If your lips turn blue, then go to the hospital. If you can&rsquo;t breathe, go to the hospital.&rdquo; When in the history of medicine have we said to someone, &ldquo;Oh, gosh, you have pneumonia&rdquo;? But once you&rsquo;re sick enough to be hospitalized, then the ICU will give you an antibiotic for your pneumonia. Insanity. Insanity. We, as physicians, have collectively lost our medical minds. Just saying, &ldquo;Well, gosh, yeah, you have an illness that we know is killing people around the world, why don&rsquo;t you just go home and see how you do?&rdquo; Insanity. The earlier you treat, the more complications you can decrease down the road. And you know what? There&rsquo;s a treatment.</p><h4 id=span-stylecolorf00us-law-does-not-allow-the-approval-of-a-vaccine-if-there-is-an-alternate-treatment-span><span style=color:red>US law does not allow the approval of a vaccine if there is an alternate treatment</span></h4><p>    <strong><a href=https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization>FDA reference added by VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p>0:13:06.0 <strong>Dr. Cole: Unfortunately, if there&rsquo;s a treatment for a disease, the federal government cannot approve a vaccine by law, by rule.</strong> So, the NIH, who is involved in approving medications, they co-hold the patent on the &ldquo;vaccine&rdquo; with Moderna. If the fox is not guarding the hen house there, I don&rsquo;t know who is. That also is insanity, to have the government in bed with a private company vending a product that they want to give to everybody. And so when they look at the potential &ldquo;therapeutics,&rdquo; hydroxychloroquine, I&rsquo;m not gonna talk about because pretty controversial. I have my opinions. I took it for 10 months. I have swabbed thousands of sick people, I never got COVID. That&rsquo;s my story on that one. There&rsquo;s a better medication, I&rsquo;m gonna discuss that next.</p><p>0:13:49.9 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Conflict of interest. <strong>Federal government in bed with a vaccine company, absolute conflict</strong> . They don&rsquo;t want a therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine. However, next slide, please, they&rsquo;ve tried <strong>remdesivir</strong> . Six months ago, the World Health Organization said, &ldquo;Stop using remdesivir. It does not add survival rate to anybody.&rdquo; $3,000 a pop. What are our hospitals still doing? Giving remdesivir. When does remdesivir work? The first two to three days of disease when the virus is replicating. By the time you are hospitalized, you are in a hyperimmune phase of the disease. Your immune system is what the hospitalists are trying to tune down. Remdesivir, again, it&rsquo;s like peeing on a forest fire. It does nothing at that point &lsquo;cause the virus has already maximally replicated. Remdesivir, expensive, of benefit to the pharmaceutical companies and their back pocket, of no benefit to your health.</p><p>0:14:42.3 <strong>Dr. Cole:Convalescent plasma</strong> . When does it work? The first two to three days of disease, when the virus is replicating. Do people get that outpatient? No, they don&rsquo;t. They only get it in the hospital when it&rsquo;s not effective. Monoclonal antibodies. When do those work? The first couple of days of the disease, when the virus is replicating. By the time you&rsquo;re in the hospital, when the virus has reached maximal replication, does it work? No, it doesn&rsquo;t. Do steroids work? To a degree, they do, once you&rsquo;re at an inflammatory stage in the hospital, yes. All right, next please.</p><h4 id=ivermectin>Ivermectin</h4><p>0:15:09.4 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Enter an effective prevention and treatment: <strong>Ivermectin</strong> . A lot of you may&mldr; We&rsquo;re in farm country, horse country, you give it to your dogs, your cats, your horses. It&rsquo;s an anti-parasitic, but it&rsquo;s a molecule. It doesn&rsquo;t read in the textbook and say, &ldquo;I can only kill parasites.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a molecule. And fascinatingly, it works against viruses too, not just SARS coronavirus, but a bunch of other viruses as well. <strong>In August of last year, we found out that it killed coronavirus 99.9% in Petri dish studies</strong> . The NIH, what did they do? For reasons I already explained, they recommended against it. And they did it on monkey cells instead of human lung cells. They&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, the dose would have to be too high.&rdquo; They fudged the data. Unfortunately, it works. It works. What did the rest of the world do while we said, &ldquo;Everybody go home and let your lips turn blue and come to the hospital&rdquo;? The rest of the world said, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s try it.&rdquo; What did the rest of the world do? A lot of trials.</p><p>0:16:03.6 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Four billion people on the planet have taken this medication since the 1980s. This medication won the Nobel Prize for the discoverer. It is that safe. It is on the world&rsquo;s safest and most essential drugs list. Four billion people have taken it with only one or two deaths out of four billion, and those people had a genetic disorder. Super, super, super safe. We&rsquo;ve given it to people at 30-40 times recommended dose, no adverse effect. In the world studies, and again therapeutic nihilism here, we&rsquo;re finally just starting to do some studies. Some brave doctors in Texas, in Florida, in Wisconsin have been using it in their hospitals. They have decreased their death rates by 70% to 90% in their hospitals, 70-90. In Houston, one hospital was using it. Now, all the hospitals in Houston are using it because they saw what the one brave doctor was doing.</p><p>0:16:58.0 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> It is an approved medication. It is safe. Is it off-label? Yes. Is the FDA approving it yet? No, because the smart doctors around the world, they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re not smart enough. Only American doctors are smart. We have to do the trials here.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Pfizer got their approval from studies overseas, not done here, so it&rsquo;s absolutely hypocritical of our three-letter agencies to be approving certain things that were done overseas and then not approving things that were done overseas.</p><p>0:17:25.2 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Placebo-controlled trials. There are 15,000 patients in meta-analysis, it has decreased the death rate. No matter what your therapy is, <strong>Ivermectin</strong> , if that&rsquo;s added to the mix, it decreases the death rate by 75%, if given early by 86%. What does that mean? Of the half a million deaths we have in North America, we would have 375,000 less deaths. There is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in Washington who have suppressed this life-saving medication. Blood on the hands of those individuals. How much does it cost? Two cents. In India, in India, an entire province, 200 million people, oh, it&rsquo;s gone. They put little blister packs together for two cents, gave it out to their entire population. They&rsquo;re at their grocery stores, they&rsquo;re at their theaters, they&rsquo;re walking around, they&rsquo;re living a normal life. Wherever it has been given in the world, they&rsquo;re back to normal life. In the US, it&rsquo;s compounded for about $2 to $5 per dose. You can get a full course of treatment for under $30, and decrease the death rate by 75% to 86%.</p><p>0:18:33.8 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Finally, some of the data from the world was presented, and the NIH hemmed and hawed. They only looked at 11 studies instead of the tens and tens and tens and tens of other studies, and they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s one that shows maybe no benefit.&rdquo; 100%. Next slide, please. 100% of the world trials have shown benefit. Decreases acquisition. Prophylactically, I&rsquo;ve been on it for two months now. In Argentina, in a hospital, trial prevented 100% of acquisition in healthcare workers. Eight hundred doctors and nurses were given it during their big outbreak. Of the 800, zero got COVID, placebo group, 57% got COVID that were not on <strong>Ivermectin</strong> . Scandinavian studies prevented acquisition by 88%.</p><p>0:19:13.0 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Multiple mechanisms of action of this molecule, don&rsquo;t have time, long medical lecture, but it&rsquo;s fun to know. The beauty of it, it can cover all the variants because of its mechanisms. All the variants. Unlike, &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re gonna have to give you a new formulation of this vaccine, or that vaccine, or that vaccine.&rdquo; No. The mechanisms of the action of this molecule against this virus don&rsquo;t stop. There&rsquo;s a great website, flccc.net. These are the doctors that are frontline pushing this forward, and they&rsquo;re the ones that got the NIH to finally listen, to finally take a neutral stance, to unshackle the hands of physicians that can prescribe it. I can say that I&rsquo;ve saved 42 lives in the last two months. I don&rsquo;t prescribe very often. Generally, I&rsquo;m behind the microscope or in the lab, but from one case to another and nobody doing anything. Elderly, obese, 83-year-old, 72-year-old, asthmatic, diabetic, to a T, every person that&rsquo;s had COVID I&rsquo;ve treated with this has been better in 12-48 hours. Twelve to 48 hours, to a T, 42 people. That&rsquo;s a small case series of patients. I know it works. Next, please.</p><p>0:20:19.6 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> All right. Vaccines. Okay, I&rsquo;m gonna be a little controversial here and may frustrate a few people. By definition, a vaccine, historically, is giving a protein, or an antigen, or a part of the pathogen and/or a whole killed pathogen. Injecting a sequence of mRNA into a human being is a medical device. Historically, what we&rsquo;re doing right now does not fall under the definition of a vaccine. They shifted the verbiage in some of the federal register back in October so they could approve this. It was a sleight of hand to change the verbiage. What we have right now is an experimental biological gene therapy immune modulatory injection. We are injecting people with a synthetic sequence of nucleic acid. We have never done this on a large scale in human history.</p><p>0:21:09.2 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> MRNA trials in mammals have led to odd cancers. MRNA trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases, not right away, six, nine, 12 months later. What we&rsquo;re doing right now, are not approved vaccines, and so, everybody, how do you create demand? You create scarcity. &ldquo;Oh gosh, we can&rsquo;t get a shot, we can&rsquo;t get a shot.&rdquo; Well, it&rsquo;s a beautiful marketing ploy to be able to say, &ldquo;Gosh, there&rsquo;s a low supply,&rdquo; so everybody wants it now. Well, everybody may want it, but the long-term safety data is not there. Fifty percent of healthcare providers are absolutely not getting this injection, and that&rsquo;s a reason. We don&rsquo;t trust the data. The fox guarded the hen house. The companies did their own data. There were no independent observer groups looking at the data. Do the shots decrease severity of disease in hospitalization? Well, they seem to be, but they don&rsquo;t fall under the definition of creating pure immunity and preventing transmission. If you&rsquo;re immune after an injection, why in the world would you still have to mask and social distance? That is an admission that they don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s a vaccine, and that&rsquo;s an absurdity.</p><p>0:22:17.0 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> There&rsquo;s no long-term proven safety. My biggest concern, honestly, next slide, please, Justin, is antibody dependent enhancement reaction. You get a shot, you&rsquo;re fine. Look, it&rsquo;s preventing this, preventing that. I&rsquo;m not anti-vax, not tinfoil hat. I&rsquo;ve had lots of vaccines, my kids have had vaccines, that&rsquo;s fine. But if you get a coronavirus shot, historically, SARS, MERS, animal coronaviruses, you get a shot, when you&rsquo;re exposed to a wild type variant of the virus six, nine, 12 months later, the immune system can go haywire. In the SARS vaccine trials in the ferrets and the monkeys, 100%, 100% of the animals, when exposed to wild type virus, ended up with immune reaction. I am sorry, I&rsquo;m probably going too long, aren&rsquo;t I?</p><p>0:23:07.3 <strong>Speaker:</strong> You&rsquo;re still good. If you wanna just wrap up your comment.</p><p>0:23:10.2 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> I&rsquo;ll just wrap it up. The vaccines are an experiment on society. Here&rsquo;s my comment on masks. Two states, one with mask. The esteemed Governor Noem&mldr; Next one. There, that one. All right. Masks, business restrictions. No masks, no business restrictions. There&rsquo;s your curve of coronavirus. You can draw your own conclusion as to whether masks do anything. I can tell you they do not. Conclusions. Lots of conclusions here. Public health message number one: Prohormone/ <strong>vitamin d</strong> , critical to every Idahoans&rsquo; immune health. That should be public message number one, every fall and winter for every year for the next 100 years. Absolutely. Two: There is an outpatient early effective prevention and treatment for COVID. <strong>Ivermectin</strong> . Number three: Your body, your choice. In my opinion, the vaccine is unproven and long-term safety is not there. We are in an endemic now, we are not in a pandemic. That&rsquo;s my two cents on coronaviruses. I know I&rsquo;m out of time, and I so thank you for the opportunity.</p><p><span>[applause]</span></p><p><span>[background conversation]</span></p><p>0:24:21.2 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> I can take two or three questions now, and afterwards, I&rsquo;ll defer. I&rsquo;m happy afterwards to hang out, answer any questions you have when the meeting is over.</p><p>0:24:28.8 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Yeah, go ahead. And if you could just repeat the question after they ask you, for the video.</p><p>0:24:32.6 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Absolutely. Thank you.</p><p>0:24:33.5 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Two more questions.</p><p>0:24:34.8 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Yes, sir.</p><p>0:24:36.2 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Is <strong>Ivermectin</strong> effective against other viruses?</p><p>0:24:38.5 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Yes, it is. It&rsquo;s effective against dengue virus, to a degree, partially effective against Ebola virus. <strong>It&rsquo;s effective against all coronaviruses</strong> . It&rsquo;s effective against certain mechanisms of certain viral families. Yes, it is. West Nile included, which hits Idaho. It is all&mldr;</p><p>0:24:53.5 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Thank you very much. Second question. I&rsquo;ve heard that the mRNA produces adverse effects on placenta in terms of pregnant females, in terms of women who may suffer some adverse effect, who plan on getting pregnant in the future. Can you touch on that?</p><p>0:25:13.2 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Yeah. So, the question is about mRNA affecting the placenta and pregnancy. Again, long-term safety data isn&rsquo;t out. There are some studies that do indicate this type of virus, especially after you&rsquo;ve given the shot and the mRNA is there, that the spike protein, it&rsquo;s called a <a href="%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytium#Placenta:~:text=Another%20important%20vertebrate%20syncytium%20is%20in%20the%20placenta%20of%20placental%20mammals.">syncytial cell</a>, and the placenta is a conglomeration of a bunch of cells, conglommed together. And it can stick to the surfaces of those type of cells, it can cause an immune reaction, and it can cause an auto-immune attack. I have a friend whose wife, seven months pregnant, got the vaccine, &lsquo;cause she was a&mldr; I hesitate to call it vaccine. Got the shot and, seven months pregnant, <strong>she just miscarried yesterday</strong> , right after the injection. Yes, sir?</p><p><span>[background conversation]</span></p><p>0:25:58.6 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Can you define cytokine storm?</p><p>0:26:01.2 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Yes, absolutely. The question is: What&rsquo;s a cytokine storm? Our immune system, we have a lot of white blood cells, certain ones, it&rsquo;s a little army fighting off things and a signal to this soldier, that soldier, this soldier, that soldier. One cell sends out this type of cytokine and recruits another white blood cell, another white blood cell. So, you have your inflammatory cytokines that ramp up your immune response, and then you have your calming cytokines that calm it down. If you have low <strong>vitamin d</strong> , all those signals keep going, &ldquo;Bring more, bring more, bring more, bring more,&rdquo; death. If you have adequate <strong>vitamin d</strong> levels, all those genes turn on and off and say, &ldquo;Ramp up, ramp up, fight, fight, fight. Hey, that&rsquo;s enough. You tune down, you turn down, you tune down.&rdquo; So, cytokines are just signals from one soldier to another in the battle against a disease. You want a cytokine response to a set degree, but then you want it to go down. How can your body naturally do that? Get your <strong>vitamin d</strong> levels normal. All the genes talk to each other. Improves immune health. Immune health, the best mask of all. Yes, ma&rsquo;am?</p><p>0:26:57.9 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Quick question then. The lipid nanoparticles that are actually in the vaccines, can that actually cause the cytokine storm?</p><p>0:27:06.8 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Lipid nanoparticle is the question. The lipid nanoparticles in these shots, <strong>70% of us are allergic to polyethylene glycol</strong> . That is antifreeze. Polyethylene glycol of 2000 is one thing they&rsquo;re putting to keep it from freezing. That can absolutely cause anaphylactic reaction in a lot of people.</p><p><span>[background conversation]</span></p><h4 id=20-of-medicines-are-used-off-label---why-not-ivermetcin-for-covid-19>20% of medicines are used off-label - why not Ivermetcin for COVID-19</h4><p>0:27:29.0 <strong>Speaker:</strong> Will we be able to get this from doctors in Idaho?</p><p>0:27:33.5 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> I know a handful of brave physicians that are prescribing it. A lot of physicians are very guideline-driven and very, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the protocol? What&rsquo;s the guideline? What&rsquo;s the word from Washington?&rdquo; Instead of &ldquo;I have a black bag, I have a medical degree and a license to practice, and I have a thinking brain.&rdquo; <strong>And one out of five medicines in America has written off-label for another disease</strong> . It&rsquo;s approved. These are approved medicines, you&rsquo;re just using it for a different condition. The short answer is, if you can&rsquo;t get it from a local doctor, there are online physicians all around the country that will prescribe it. Myfreedoctor.com, etcetera, etcetera. There are a bunch of online sites. I know some brave individuals that are saving lives. It&rsquo;s frustrating to try to get the data to my colleagues and say, &ldquo;Guys, we don&rsquo;t need the degree of death we&rsquo;re seeing.&rdquo; And this is a preventable disease. You can prophylax, you can treat. And not only that. Down the road, if you have long-term symptoms, <strong>Ivermectin</strong> can tune those down as well. It is a phenomenal medication. And it&rsquo;s immune modulator, not just a viral killer.</p><p>0:28:40.3 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> Thank you so much. I will hang out afterwards if you have questions, and thank you so much for the opportunity.</p><p><span>[applause]</span></p><p><span>[background conversation]</span></p><p>0:28:50.5 <strong>Speaker:</strong> I just wanna thank Dr. Cole for being here, taking time out of his busy schedule for being here today to help educate us. Thank you for the work that you&rsquo;ve done. I read an article, you&rsquo;re one of the biggest labs, done most of the testing, and where you slept on your chair, sometimes got four hours of sleep here and there. So, thank you. Thank you for your work for Idaho.</p><p>0:29:13.0 <strong>Dr. Cole:</strong> My pleasure.
