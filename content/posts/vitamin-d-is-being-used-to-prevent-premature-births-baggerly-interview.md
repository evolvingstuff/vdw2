 **Episode notes by [Dr. Cannell of Vitamin D Council](http://www.vitamindcouncil.org/)** 

Baggerly is the head of [GrassrootsHealth](http://www.grassrootshealth.net/), a fellow non-profit organization focusing on migrating vitamin D research into practice. Though faced with many challenges along the way, Baggerly and team found that pregnant women, their physicians and the institutions were ready to begin implementing vitamin D education, testing and supplementation into their prenatal regimen.

In this episode, Baggerly discusses the success of her vitamin D program for pregnant women in South Carolina and provides insight on a study in which she played an instrumental role in publishing regarding vitamin D status and premature birth risk.

#### Notes by Henry Lahore of VitaminDWiki

<a href="/posts/4000-iu-vitamin-d-safe-and-effective-for-healthy-pregnant-women-rct" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: 4000 IU Vitamin D Safe and Effective For Healthy Pregnant Women – RCT June 2011">2012 study</a> looked only at treatment groups

Baggerly re-analyzed to look at the vitamin D level actually achieved

<a href="/posts/preterm-birth-rate-reduced-57-percent-by-vitamin-d-nov-2015-had-the-following-im-h-low-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Preterm birth rate reduced 57 percent by Vitamin D – Nov 2015)) had the following
{img attId="6147" width="600"}
{img attId="6150"  width="600"}
Most of the white women already had 30 ng of vitamin D, so not as much reduction in pre-term bith
Study at 40 ng was confirmed 2 ways – the data and March of Dimes

((Chance of preterm birth is strongly associated with low vitamin D – Feb 2015">Liza Bodnar also found same thing – 3,000 women   Feb 2015</a>

Starting year of organizations: Viamin D Council 2001,. Grassroots 2007,  VitaminDWiki 2009

She is training the full OBGYN staff – not just the OBGYN doctors

She has  [two continuing medical education courses](http://www.grassrootshealth.net/vitamin-d-cmes?%20width=700&height=500&utm_source=Announcing+Protect+our+Children+NOW%21&utm_campaign=March+25+2015+Newsletter&utm_medium=email) online

She had started 500 women – but they expanded it to 2,000 women per year

Compliance: Phone encouragement does not seem to help,  have online chat room

They do have texting to the women – 100% of them have cellphones

Vitamin D is now the standard of care  at that institution – so physician is not at risk for law suits

Funding for South Carolina was by Managed Care Insurance

Cost of the 2 year project is $450,000  (for 500 women?)

Estimated cost benefit $8 million annually for 2000 women

Dr. Cannell would like to have children continue to be on vitamin D – but nothing is funded, or implemented

Dr. Cannell believes Vitamin D is needed by toddler, wherease 98% of researchers believe that Autisim is lack of D during pregnancy

Expansion of providing vitamin D during pregnancy outside of South Carolina

Generally the hospitals that are wanting to do it

* Missoula Montana – in process , 

* initial in Connecticut and Arkansas

Dr. Cannell: Probably should have only 1 claim – premature birth, will be easier for people to understand than 10 claims

She wants to tell journals that  **It is essential that Vitamin D analysis be done on outcome serum levels, not dosing levels** 

e.g. 40 ng, not 4,000 IU dosing
