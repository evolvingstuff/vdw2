* Started giving cod liver oil as infant

* Main benefit was probably during the Winter, Spring when vitamin D from sun not available.

* Best reduction in MS incidence if continued through teen years

* Best reduction if it contains 600-800 IU

* VitaminDWiki suspects that higher amounts were associated with higher amounts of Vitamin A, which may block the benefits of Vitamin D

BACKGROUND:

Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), although it remains unknown whether this relationship varies by age.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this paper is to investigate the association between vitamin D3 supplementation through cod liver oil at different postnatal ages and MS risk.

METHODS:

In the Norwegian component of the multinational case-control study Environmental Factors In Multiple Sclerosis (EnvIMS), a total of 953 MS patients with maximum disease duration of 10 years and 1717 controls reported their cod liver oil use from childhood to adulthood.

RESULTS:

Self-reported supplement use at ages 13-18 was associated with a reduced risk of MS (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.86), whereas supplementation during childhood was not found to alter MS risk (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81-1.26), each compared to non-use during the respective period. An inverse association was found between MS risk and the dose of cod liver oil during adolescence, suggesting a dose-response relationship (p trend = 0.001) with the strongest effect for an estimated vitamin  **D3 intake of 600-800 IU/d (OR 0.46** , 95% CI 0.31-0.70).

CONCLUSIONS:

These findings not only support the hypothesis relating to low vitamin D as a risk factor for MS, but further point to adolescence as an important susceptibility period for adult-onset MS.
