Background: Calcium concentrations in serum are maintained within an exquisitely narrow range. Our aim was to examine the association between serum calcium and albumin-adjusted calcium (calciumadj) levels and stroke outcome in a cohort of unselected patients with acute stroke. 

Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized due to acute stroke (ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage) throughout a large medical center were systematically assessed and  **followed for 1 year** . Baseline total calcium and calciumadj levels were collapsed into groups of low (<8.6 mg/dl), normal (8.7–9.9 mg/dl) and high (>10 mg/dl) levels and linear and quadratic relations with outcome were examined. 

Result: Among 784 patients (mean age 70.7 ± 12.5 years, 42.5% females), the mean ± SD total calcium level was 9.3 ± 0.6 mg/dl. 

For total calcium, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause death over 1 year was 1.83 <span>[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–2.75]</span> among patients with low versus normal levels. For calciumadj, the adjusted HR for all-cause death among  **women was over 3-fold higher**  among patients with high calciumadj levels versus those with normal levels (3.31; 95% CI 1.70–6.46), while  **no such associations were observed among men** . In models developed to estimate the linear and quadratic relations, each unit increment in total calcium squared was associated with an increased adjusted HR of all-cause death over 1 year (p = 0.02) confirming nonlinear associations, and each unit increment in calciumadj squared was associated with an increased adjusted HR of all-cause death over 1 year among women (p < 0.001) but not among men (p = 0.70). 

Conclusions: Serum calcium concentrations are a marker of mortality in acute stroke patients, but the associations are not linear, increasing at both extremes of calcium levels. Our findings suggest that long-term survival is optimal in a distinct range of serum calcium levels.

# Summary: In one year after senior stroke

## Too little Calcium increased death rate for all patients by 1.8X

## Too much Calcium increased death rate for women by 3X – no increase for men

## Reminder: vitamin D and Magnesium are both very important in the regulation of calcium in the body
