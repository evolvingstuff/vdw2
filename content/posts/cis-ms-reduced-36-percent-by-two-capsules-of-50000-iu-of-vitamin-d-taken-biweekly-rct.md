Importance  Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is associated with the risk of disease activity, but data on the benefits of supplementation are conflicting.

Objective  To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose cholecalciferol as monotherapy in reducing disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) typical for MS.

Design, Setting, and Participants  The D-Lay MS trial was a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 MS centers in France. Patients were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2020 (final follow-up on January 18, 2023). Untreated patients with CIS aged 18 to 55 years with CIS duration less than 90 days, serum vitamin D concentration less than 100 nmol/L, and diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meeting 2010 criteria for dissemination in space or 2 or more lesions and presence of oligoclonal bands were recruited.

Intervention  Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU (n = 163) or placebo (n = 153) every 2 weeks for 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome measure was disease activity, defined as occurrence of a relapse and/or MRI activity (new and/or contrast-enhancing lesions) over 24 months of follow-up, also analyzed as separate secondary outcomes.

Results  Of the 316 participants enrolled and randomized (median <span>[IQR]</span> age, 34 <span>[28-42]</span> years; 70% women), the primary analysis included 303 patients (95.9%) who took at least 1 dose of the study drug and 288 (91.1%) ultimately completed the 24-month trial. 

Disease activity 

* was observed in 94 patients (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 patients (74.1%) in the placebo group ( **hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span>, 0.66**  <span>[95% CI, 0.50-0.87]</span>; P = .004), and 

* median time to disease activity was longer in the vitamin D group (432 vs 224 days; log-rank P = .003).

All 3 secondary MRI outcomes reported significant differences favoring the vitamin D group vs the placebo group: 

* MRI activity (89 patients <span>[57.1%]</span> vs 96 patients <span>[65.3%]</span>; HR, 0.71 <span>[95% CI, 0.53-0.95]</span>; P = .02), 

* new lesions (72 patients <span>[46.2%]</span> vs 87 patients <span>[59.2%]</span>; HR, 0.61 <span>[95% CI, 0.44-0.84]</span>; P = .003), and 

* contrast-enhancing lesions (29 patients <span>[18.6%]</span> vs 50 patients <span>[34.0%]</span>; HR, 0.47 <span>[95% CI, 0.30-0.75]</span>; P = .001). 

All 10 secondary clinical outcomes showed no significant difference, including 

* relapse, which occurred in 28 patients (17.9%) in the vitamin D group vs 32 (21.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.69 <span>[95% CI, 0.42-1.16]</span>; P = .16). Results were similar in a subset of 247 patients meeting updated 2017 diagnostic criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at treatment initiation. 

Severe adverse events occurred in 17 patients in the vitamin D group and 13 in the placebo group, none of which were related to cholecalciferol.

Conclusions and Relevance  Oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU every 2 weeks significantly reduced disease activity in CIS and early relapsing-remitting MS. These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as add-on therapy.

Trial Registration  ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01817166

!!!!High-Dose Vitamin D in Clinically Isolated Syndrome Typical of Multiple Sclerosis – The D-Lay MS Randomized Clinical Trial
JAMA. March 10, 2025. doi:10.1001/jama.2025.1604 PDF behind paywall

Importance  Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is associated with the risk of disease activity, but data on the benefits of supplementation are conflicting.

Objective  To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose cholecalciferol as monotherapy in reducing disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) typical for MS.

Design, Setting, and Participants  The D-Lay MS trial was a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 MS centers in France. Patients were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2020 (final follow-up on January 18, 2023). Untreated patients with CIS aged 18 to 55 years with CIS duration less than 90 days, serum vitamin D concentration less than 100 nmol/L, and diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meeting 2010 criteria for dissemination in space or 2 or more lesions and presence of oligoclonal bands were recruited.

Intervention  Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU (n = 163) or placebo (n = 153) every 2 weeks for 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome measure was disease activity, defined as occurrence of a relapse and/or MRI activity (new and/or contrast-enhancing lesions) over 24 months of follow-up, also analyzed as separate secondary outcomes.

Results  Of the 316 participants enrolled and randomized (median [IQR] age, 34 [28-42] years; 70% women), the primary analysis included 303 patients (95.9%) who took at least 1 dose of the study drug and 288 (91.1%) ultimately completed the 24-month trial. 

Disease activity 
*was observed in 94 patients (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 patients (74.1%) in the placebo group (__hazard ratio [HR], 0.66__ [95% CI, 0.50-0.87]; P = .004), and 
*median time to disease activity was longer in the vitamin D group (432 vs 224 days; log-rank P = .003).
 All 3 secondary MRI outcomes reported significant differences favoring the vitamin D group vs the placebo group: 
*MRI activity (89 patients [57.1%] vs 96 patients [65.3%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53-0.95]; P = .02), 
*new lesions (72 patients [46.2%] vs 87 patients [59.2%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.44-0.84]; P = .003), and 
*contrast-enhancing lesions (29 patients [18.6%] vs 50 patients [34.0%]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30-0.75]; P = .001). 
All 10 secondary clinical outcomes showed no significant difference, including 
*relapse, which occurred in 28 patients (17.9%) in the vitamin D group vs 32 (21.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.42-1.16]; P = .16). Results were similar in a subset of 247 patients meeting updated 2017 diagnostic criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at treatment initiation. 
Severe adverse events occurred in 17 patients in the vitamin D group and 13 in the placebo group, none of which were related to cholecalciferol.

Conclusions and Relevance  Oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU every 2 weeks significantly reduced disease activity in CIS and early relapsing-remitting MS. These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as add-on therapy.
