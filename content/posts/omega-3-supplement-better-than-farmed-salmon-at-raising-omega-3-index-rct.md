* RCT - Gave farmed salmon, beef, or Omega-3 at school lunch 3 times a week for 12 weeks

* Note:  Farmed salmon have much more Omega-6 than wild salmon 

> Farmed salmon (and fish in general) do not get as much exercise, have a poor diet, and have poor living conditions

> However, farmed salmon costs about 1/4 that of wild salmon

* Trial lasted only 12 weeks

> Note It takes at least 25 weeks for Omega-3 change to plateau in the blood and thus show some benefit
