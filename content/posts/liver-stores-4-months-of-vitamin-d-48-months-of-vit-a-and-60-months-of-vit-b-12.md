### From [An Apple A Day: Give a second thought to your liver](http://www.appeal-democrat.com/glenn_county_transcript/an-apple-a-day-give-a-second-thought-to-your/article_8e6d105a-0f17-11e5-975c-dfa09f09f232.html)

In her book  **"Digestive Wellness,"**  Elizabeth Lipinski explains: 

"Your four-and-a-half pound liver manufactures 13,000 chemicals and has 2,000 enzymes, plus thousands of synergists that help with body functions. 

It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins; it manufactures cholesterol, testosterone and estrogens; it regulates blood sugar levels, it processes all food, nutrients, alcohol and drugs, and other material that enter the bloodstream and lets them pass, breaks them down or stores them."
