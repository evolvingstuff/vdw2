The number of COVID-19 patients is still growing exponentially worldwide due to the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therapeutic agents currently under investigation are antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other adjuvants that could relieve symptoms or improve the healing process. In this review, twelve therapeutic agents that could play a role in prophylaxis or improvement of the COVID-19-associated symptoms (as add-on substances) are discussed. Agents were identified based on their known pharmacologic mechanism of action in viral and/or nonviral fields and are postulated to interact with one or more of the seven known mechanisms associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus: (i) regulation of the immune system; (ii) virus entrance in the cell; (iii) virus replication; (iv) hyperinflammation; (v) oxidative stress; (vi) thrombosis; and (vii) endotheliitis. 

Selected agents were

* immune transfer factor (oligo- and polypeptides from porcine spleen, ultrafiltered at <10 kDa; Imuno TF ®),

* anti-inflammatory natural blend ( Uncaria tomentosa,  Endopleura uchi and  Haematoccocus pluvialis; Miodesin ®), 

* zinc, 

* selenium, 

* ascorbic acid, 

* cholecalciferol, 

* ferulic acid, 

* spirulina, 

* N-acetylcysteine, 

* glucosamine sulfate 

* potassium hydrochloride,

* trans-resveratrol, and 

* maltodextrin-stabilized orthosilicic acid (SiliciuMax ®). 

This review gives the scientific background on the hypothesis that these therapeutic agents can act in synergy in the prevention and improvement of COVID-19-associated symptoms.
