Recent studies suggest a potential link between vitamin D and its metabolites in</p><p>enhancing the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication therapies through their bactericidal properties.</p><p>Aim: To investigate the correlation between the vitamin D levels and their influence on clinical management and treatment</p><p>results of children patients, tested for H. pylori.</p><p>Material and methods: The study was conducted on a cohort of 128 paediatric patients. They were divided into 2 groups,</p><p>depending on whether positive (first group – A) or negative (second group – B ) for H. pylori. To determine vitamin D levels, venous</p><p>blood was taken from all participants from both groups. Group 1 included patients whose indexes were up to 10 ng/ml; Group 2</p><p>included patients whose indexes were from 10 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml; Group 3 levels were from 20 ng/ml to 30 ng/ml; and Group 4</p><p>indexes were over 30 ng/ml. The efficiency of the H. pylori eradication scheme in participants of these groups was evaluated.</p><p>Results: The mean values in Group A were higher than those in Group B: 17.1 and 14.9, respectively, p-value 0.03. Helicobacter pylori prevalence was higher in participants with vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml. As a result of the study, it was established that vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml in blood serum could be a predisposing factor in the spread of H. pylori in paediatric</p><p>patients. At the same time, different levels of deficiency below 30 ng/ml did not affect the frequency of H. pylori infection.</p><p>Conclusions: The obtained data can be used in developing guidelines for clinical management of children patients who are</p><p>primarily diagnosed with H. pylori and require eradication therapy.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/helicobacter-pylori-children.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=recent-advances-in-vitamin-d3-intervention-to-eradicate-helicobacter-pylori-infection---feb-2024>Recent Advances in Vitamin D3 Intervention to Eradicate Helicobacter pylori Infection - Feb 2024</h4><p>Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare Volume 17, 2024 - <a href=https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S454605>https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S454605</a></p><p>Peng-Fei MaORCID Icon,Lin Zhuo,Li-Ping Yuan &amp;Xiao-Hui Qi</p><p>Helicobacter pylori (HP) infections affect approximately one-third of children worldwide. In China, the incidence of HP infection in children ranges from approximately 30% to 60%. In addition to damaging the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, HP infection in children can negatively affect their growth and development, hematology, respiratory and hepatobiliary system, skin, nutritional metabolism, and autoimmune system. However, the rate of HP eradication also fell considerably from the previous rate due to the presence of drug-resistant HP strains and the limited types of antibiotics that can be used in young patients. Vitamin D3 (VitD3) is a steroid hormone that can reduce inflammation in the stomach mucosa induced by HP and can alleviate and eradicate HP through a variety of pathways and mechanisms, including immune regulation and the stimulation of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) secretion and Ca2+ influx, to reestablish lysosomal acidification; thus, these results provide new strategies and ideas for the eradication of drug-resistant HP strains.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/recent-advances-pylori-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=wikipedia-helicobacter-pylori-eradication-protocolshttpsenwikipediaorgwikihelicobacter_pylori_eradication_protocols>Wikipedia: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori_eradication_protocols>Helicobacter pylori eradication protocols</a></h5><ul><li>&ldquo;Helicobacter pylori eradication protocols is a standard name for all treatment protocols for peptic ulcers and gastritis in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection.

Three major databases were searched for articles that analyzed a relationship between vitamin D status and H. pylori infection. The literature search retrieved a total of 37 reports, after the article selection process.</p><p>Hypovitaminosis D emerged as a potential risk factor for H. pylori infection, given the higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and/or insufficiency among H. pylori-positive subjects. Furthermore, the same type of micronutrient deficiency has been directly linked to H. pylori eradication failure. An inverse linear relationship between vitamin D status and gastric cancer risk exists, but the additional involvement of H. pylori in this correlation is still in question. The potential benefit of oral supplements in enhancing the success of classical therapeutic regimens of H. pylori still requires future research.

Pylori-positive patients, a prospective cohort study was carried out. PCR was used to genotype all patients&rsquo; VDR gene polymorphisms. The patients in the study received standard triple eradication medication (clarithromycin 500 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, and omeprazole 20 mg) twice daily for 14 days. A stool test for H. pylori Ag was conducted 4 weeks following the end of treatment.</p><p>Results: In our study, the usual triple therapy&rsquo;s H. pylori eradication rate was 75.2%. The successful eradication of H. pylori and VDR rs 2228570 gene polymorphisms was more prevalent in CT gene polymorphism ( <strong>64.6%</strong> ) compared to non-responders ( <strong>19.2%</strong> ), while treatment failure was more prevalent in CC gene polymorphism (73.1% in non-responders compared to responders 24.1%), which is statistically significant.</p><p>In regards to the eradication of H. pylori and VDR rs7975232 gene polymorphisms, the success of eradication was more prevalent in AC gene polymorphism (54.4%) vs non-responders (30.4%), while all patients (14) with gene AA (17.7%) are responders to standard treatment, while the failure of treatment was more prevalent in CC gene polymorphism (69.2% in non-responder vs 27.8% in responders) which is statistically significant. Our findings demonstrated a strong correlation between patients&rsquo; responses to H. pylori treatment and polymorphisms in the VDR gene (ApaI and TaqI) (P 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: As far as we are aware, this is the first study to identify a potential link between the FokI and Apal VDR polymorphism and treatment response in H pylori-positive patients.

After confirmation of H. pylori infection, mice were treated with different doses of VitD3. The infection levels in stomach tissues were quantified using the colony-forming assay, and the expression levels of the VDR and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) in the gastric mucosa were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting.</p><p>Results: The gastric mucosa of VDR+/- mice was more susceptible to H. pylori colonization and had lower levels of VDR and CAMP expression than that of VDR+/+ mice. H. pylori infection upregulated VDR and CAMP expression in the stomach of both wild-type and mutant mice, and VitD3 treatment resulted in further increase of VDR and CAMP levels, while significantly and dose-dependently decreasing the H. pylori colonization rate in both mouse groups, without affecting blood calcium or phosphorus levels.</p><p>Conclusion: Our data indicate that oral administration of VitD3 reduces the H. pylori colonization rate and upregulates VDR and CAMP expression in the gastric mucosa, suggesting a role for VitD3/VDR/CAMP signaling in the eradication of H. pylori in the stomach. These findings provide important insights into the mechanism underlying the anti-H. pylori activity of VitD3 and should be useful in the development of measures to eradicate H. pylori.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/iceland-daly.jpg>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d3-inhibits-helicobacter-pylori-infection-by-activating-the-vitd3vdr-camp-pathway-in-mice---oct-2020>Vitamin D3 Inhibits Helicobacter pylori Infection by Activating the VitD3/VDR-CAMP Pathway in Mice - Oct 2020</h5><p>Front.

Therefore, eliminating H. pylori infection should help to prevent gastric diseases. Vitamin D3 (VitD3, 1,25(OH)2D3) was previously observed to exhibit anti-H. pylori infection activity in clinic, but these results were reported in heterogeneous in vivo studies without elucidation of the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we established H. pylori infection models in both wild-type and VDR knockdown (VDR-KD) mice, which were used to demonstrate that VitD3 inhibits H. pylori infection by enhancing the expression of VitD receptor (VDR) and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP). Furthermore, VDR-KD mice that exhibited lower VDR expression were more susceptible to H. pylori infection. In cultured mouse primary gastric epithelial cells, we further demonstrated that the VitD3/VDR complex binds to the CAMP promoter region to increase its expression. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of the anti-H. pylori infection activity of VitD3 at the molecular level in mice and suggest a new avenue for the clinical management of H. pylori eradication therapy.</p><hr><h4 id=the-effect-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-on-eradication-rates-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection--oct-2018>The effect of vitamin D deficiency on eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection – Oct 2018</h4><p>JGH Open. 2018 Dec; 2(6): 270–275. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12081>doi: 10.1002/jgh3.12081</a>, PMCID: PMC6308038.

The aim of this study was to study the effect of serum levels of 25‐hydroxy‐vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) on eradication rates of H. pylori infection.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This study included 150 patients diagnosed with H. pylori gastritis using magnifying narrow‐band imaging endoscopy supported by stool antigen test. Serum 25‐OH vitamin D levels were measured via the Enzyme‐Linked Immune Sorbent assay (ELISA) method before starting eradication therapy of H. pylori infection. All patients were treated with clarithromycin‐based triple therapy for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was determined via a stool antigen test performed 4 weeks after the end of therapy. According to the serum level of 25‐OH vitamin D levels, the patients were divided into two groups: group I (sufficient) had a vitamin D level of ≥20 ng/mL, while group II (deficient) had a vitamin D level of &lt;20 ng/mL.</p><p>Results</p><p>Our results revealed that eradication was successful in 105 (70%) patients and failed in 45 (30%) patients.
