#### Snipped from Grassroots Health email

* The US premature birthrate has risen 36% over the last 25 years; over half a million preterm births happen in the US each year. 

* Preterm birth is the number one killer of newborns and the second leading cause of death in children under five. 

* Vitamin D could possibly prevent 50% of preterm births, 

* AND cut the risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and prenatal infections in HALF.

In conversations with hospital administrators and insurance company leaders, I learned about '17P'. 17P is a drug commonly used in hospitals and medical centers for pregnant women who have previously had a preterm birth. It is given to pregnant women as a weekly injection and is effective in reducing preterm birth by approximately  **30%** . 

Unfortunately, it has a price tag of $50,000 per patient and the requirement for weekly injections is difficult for many women to meet. The same doctors who prescribe 17P were elated to find out about vitamin D, because:

* Vitamin D has the potential to reduce preterm birth by  **50%** . 

* Vitamin D can be given to all pregnant women - whether they have had a prior preterm birth or not.

* Vitamin D costs $15 for the entire pregnancy.
