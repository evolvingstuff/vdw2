#### There have been various studies which have found weight loss when increasing one or more of the following

##### Vitamin D &nbsp; &nbsp; Magnesium &nbsp; &nbsp; Calcium

There is a lot of synergy/interaction between these nutrients in the body

There has been a very large decrease in both Magnesium and Vitamin D in bodies during the past 40 years

There has been a significant increase in obesity in the past 40 years

Wonder if there has been any weight loss trial using all three of the supplements
