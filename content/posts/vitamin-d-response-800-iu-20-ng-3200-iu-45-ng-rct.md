* Abstract fails to mention how much to achieve their original goal of 30 ng: which is no longer politically correct

> The clinical trial entry had speculated that 4400 IU would be needed to achieve 30 ng

* Trial used too much Calcium: average 1300 mg

> Other studies have shown that 500 mg would have been plenty

> Hypercalcemia in about 5% â€“ independent of dose

* Small study: about 20 postmenopausal white women per dose level.

> Apparently all participants had osteoporosis ( **<span style="color:#090Clinical Trial;">at bottom of this page</span>** )

Background: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-<span>[OH]</span>D) is considered the best biomarker of clinical vitamin D status. 

Objective: To determine the effect of increasing oral doses of vitamin D(3) on serum 25-(OH)D and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in postmenopausal white women with vitamin D insufficiency (defined as a 25-<span>[OH]</span>D level ?50 nmol/L) in the presence of adequate calcium intake. These results can be used as a guide to estimate the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (defined as meeting the needs of 97.5% of the population) for vitamin D(3). 

Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: [NCT00472823](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00472823?term=NCT00472823&rank=1%20)) 

Setting: Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska. 

Participants: 163 healthy postmenopausal white women with vitamin D insufficiency enrolled in the winter or spring of 2007 to 2008 and followed for  **1 year** . 

Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or vitamin D(3), 

* 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, or 4800 IU once daily. 

Daily  **calcium**  supplements were provided to increase the total daily calcium intake to  **1200 to 1400 mg.** 

Measurements: The primary outcomes were 25-(OH)D and PTH levels at 6 and 12 months. 

Results: The mean baseline 25-(OH)D level was 39 nmol/L. 

The dose response was curvilinear and tended to plateau at approximately 112 nmol/L in patients receiving more than 3200 IU/d of vitamin D(3). 

The RDA of vitamin D(3) to achieve a 25-(OH)D level greater than 50 nmol/L was 800 IU/d. 

A mixed-effects model predicted that 600 IU of vitamin D(3) daily could also meet this goal. 

Compared with participants with a normal body mass index (<25 kg/m(2)), obese women (?30 kg/m(2)) had a 25-(OH)D level that was 17.8 nmol/L lower. 

Parathyroid hormone levels at 12 months decreased with an increasing dose of vitamin D(3) (P = 0.012). 

Depending on the criteria used, 

* hypercalcemia occurred in 2.8% to 9.0% and 

* hypercalciuria in 12.0% to 33.0% of participants; 

>  **events were unrelated to dose.** 

Limitation: Findings may not be generalizable to other age groups or persons with substantial comorbid conditions. 

Conclusion: A vitamin D(3) dosage of 800 IU/d increased serum 25-(OH)D levels to greater than 50 nmol/L in 97.5% of women; however, a model predicted the same response with a vitamin D(3) dosage of 600 IU/d. 

These results can be used as a guide for the RDA of vitamin D(3), but prospective trials are needed to confirm the clinical significance of these results.

### Obese had less response to the same vitamin D dose (perhaps just due to extra weight)
