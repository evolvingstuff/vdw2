Under the ruling, bakers may use the yeast at levels not to exceed 400 international units (I.U.) of vitamin D per 100 grams in the finished foods, up from 90 I.U. previously. 

## FDA also recognized as GRAS Food Maximum levels/100 gram

* Breakfast cereal 350 I.U. 

* Grain products and pasta 90 I.U. 

* Milk 42 I.U. 

* Milk products 89 I.U.

Additionally, vitamin D has been affirmed as GRAS in a wide range of additional products, including infant formula, margarine, calcium-fortified fruit juices, meal replacement and other types of bars and cheese substitutes.
