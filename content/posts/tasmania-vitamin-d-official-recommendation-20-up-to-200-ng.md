 **Does not seem logical.  Suspect they have been too influenced by the sun scare in Australia**

### Not much vitamin D available in capsules in Tasmania

* The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) at 1 October 2012 lists over 150 items as  containing vitamin D. 

> Appears that the highest dose vitamin D capsule is 1,000 IU

* If need to restore: 50,000 IU/ month = Recommended supplementation dosing regimens for adults with risk factors for moderate-severe deficiency 

### Comment by VitaminDWiki

 **Tasmania recommends restoring adults with moderate deficiency risk factors with 50,000 IU/month** 

 **but that the highest dose over-the counter dose size is 1,000 IU.** 

 **Is the 50,000 dose size only available via a prescription?**
