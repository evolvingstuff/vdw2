BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) is a transacting transcription factor which mediates immunomodulatory function and plays a key role in innate and adaptive immune responses through its ligand and polymorphisms in VDR gene may affect its regulatory function.

OBJECTIVE:

To investigate the association of three VDR gene polymorphisms (TaqI rs731236, FokI rs2228570 & ApaI rs7975232) with Leprosy.

METHODS:

The study group includes 404 participants of which 222 were leprosy patients (Paucibacillary=87, Multibacillary=135) and 182 healthy controls. Genotyping was done using PCR-RFLP technique. Statistical analysis was performed using SNP Stats & PLINK software.

RESULTS:

The VDR FokI (rs2228570) ff genotype, ApaI (rs7975232) AA, Aa genotype and haplotype T-f-a, T-F-A were positively associated with leprosy when compared to healthy controls.

CONCLUSION:

The two variants at Fok and Apa positions in VDR gene are significantly associated with leprosy. Genotypes at FokI (ff), ApaI (aa) and haplotype (T-F-a, T-f-a) may contribute to the risk of developing leprosy by altering VDR phenotype/levels subsequently modulation of immune response.
