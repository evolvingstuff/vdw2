#### Maternal vitamin D₃ supplementation at 50 μg/d protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation.

BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants. Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration after birth is unknown.

OBJECTIVES:

We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (>30, >40, >50, and >75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age.

DESIGN:

Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 μg vitamin D₃/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum.

RESULTS:

At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)](nmol/L%20(95%%20CI)) infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-μg/d <span>[75 (67, 83)]</span> than in the 25-μg/d <span>[52 (45, 58)]</span> or 10-μg/d <span>[45 (38, 52)]</span> vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration <30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-μg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-μg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration >75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-μg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (∼98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration >30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-μg/d <span>[88 (84, 91)]</span> than in the 25-μg/d <span>[78 (74, 81)]</span> or 10-μg/d <span>[69 (66, 73)]</span> groups (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 μg vitamin D₃/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (<30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 μg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.
