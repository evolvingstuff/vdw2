Tried many different UV sources, but the bearded dragon reptiles ate as much under each UV source.

Article mentions that perhaps none of the UV sources were been strong enough

# UV Sources:

* group 1 with a ZooMed Laboratories, Inc. PowerSun®  UV 100 W mercury vapor. 

* group 2 with a 20 W full spectrum compact fluorescent bulb (Full Spectrum Solutions, Inc., P.O. Box 1087, Jackson, MI 49204, USA; Model PCF 209155).

* group 3 with a ZooMed Laboratories, Inc. Reptisun® (5.0) hard-quartz glass fluorescent tube light. 

* group 4 with a standard 100 W incandescent bulb. 

* group 5 was maintained outside in an area protected from wind and rain

UV-B radiation levels were measured using a digital ultraviolet radiometer (ZooMed Laboratories, 3650 Sacramento Drive, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401; Digital Ultraviolet Radiometer Item # ST-6).

# Strange: it appears that while the bulbs all put out about the same amount of UVB that there was a big difference in the vitamin D in the reptiles

## Suspect that the spectrum is somehow important
