More than half of U.S. adults age 20 and older take vitamins or other dietary supplements, a new government study shows.

The percentage who took at least one dietary supplement increased to 53 percent in 2006, up from 42 percent in 1994.

Multivitamins/multiminerals are the most common: Almost 40 percent of people reported taking them in 2006.

"The majority of dietary supplement users report using them every day over the past 30 days," says Jaime Gahche, nutritional researcher with the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

These findings are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, considered the gold standard because thousands of people are interviewed for it.

## Other findings:

* 61 percent of women age 60 and older take a supplement containing calcium.

* A substantial number of adult women (44 percent) and men (35 percent) are taking supplements that contain vitamin D, which is critical for bone health.

* In 2006, 34 percent of women age 20 to 39 reported taking a supplement containing folic acid, which is critical for women of childbearing age to prevent neural tube defects.
