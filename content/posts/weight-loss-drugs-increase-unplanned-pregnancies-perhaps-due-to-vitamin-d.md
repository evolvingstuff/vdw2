#### What is the rate of increased unplanned pregnancies due to weight loss drugs - Asked Perplexity AI MayÂ 2024

The rate of increased unplanned pregnancies due to weight loss drugs like Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Zepbound is not precisely quantified in the available sources. However, there is a notable trend of unexpected pregnancies among women using these medications, which has been widely reported in various media outlets and social media platforms.Several factors contribute to this phenomenon:

1.  **Improved Fertility** : Weight loss induced by these medications can correct hormonal imbalances, particularly in women with conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thereby restoring regular ovulation and increasing the likelihood of pregnancy.

1.  **Reduced Effectiveness of Birth Control** : These drugs can slow gastric emptying, which may interfere with the absorption of oral contraceptives, making them less effective and increasing the risk of unplanned pregnancies.

1.  **Anecdotal Reports** : Numerous anecdotal reports and social media posts have highlighted cases of women becoming pregnant while on these medications, even when using birth control or having a history of infertility.

1.  **Lack of Comprehensive Data** : While there are many anecdotal reports, comprehensive data on the exact rate of increased unplanned pregnancies is lacking. Drug manufacturers and researchers are currently collecting data to better understand the safety and implications of these medications during pregnancy.

In summary, while there is a clear trend of increased unplanned pregnancies among women using weight loss drugs, the exact rate is not well-documented. The phenomenon is attributed to both improved fertility due to weight loss and the potential reduced effectiveness of oral contraceptives when taken with these medications.
