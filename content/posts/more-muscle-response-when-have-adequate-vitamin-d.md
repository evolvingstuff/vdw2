#### An excellent study showed why vitamin D helps muscle response.

The image below was photographed from a Vitamin D encyclopedia edited by Feldman and published in 2005. 

The original information, as you can see on the image, was published in 2000

 **Summary: The muscle force increased by 50% when the person had adequate level of vitamin D** 

The same electrical pulse was given to a leg muscle before, during, and after the addition of vitamin D to their diet 

People with low level of vitamin D initially had the least reaction to the pulse: N = 50  approx

The strength of the reaction to the pulse increased over months of adding vitamin D ( does not mention how much vitamin D)

until the strength of the reaction (the kick) was measured to be N = 75 approx.

 **This implies that elderly will fall less if they have enough vitamin D** 

The muscles will put out 50% more force when given a brain signal to react  fall type situation.

This increased force is probably due to the vitamin D improving the Calcium metabolism, which is essential for muscle activity.
