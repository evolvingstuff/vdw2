#### Promising therapeutic approach for SARS-CoV-2 infection by using a rutin-based combination therapy

ChemMedChem. 2022 Apr 30. [doi: 10.1002/cmdc.202200157](https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.202200157) behind paywall

The development of new therapeutic approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection is of particular current importance. The combination therapy proposed here is based on already proven, safe compounds. The natural compound rutin, one of the six therapy components, has the potential to inhibit both viral and host cell targets. In addition, this therapy involves the use of acetylsalicylic acid, vitamin C and vitamin D 3 , which should be administered together with calcium and magnesium. The importance of each component is briefly described in this article. Due to multiple anti-infective properties of rutin, it provides a basis for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as various viral and bacterial co-infections observed in patients. There are strong indications for a good effect of this simple combination therapy, especially in the early stages of infection. It has the potential to be of interest both prophylactically and therapeutically, and offers the possibility of protection against severe disease progression.
