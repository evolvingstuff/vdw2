#### 2.7 X more likely to have low Vitamin D if have Herpes Simplex Virus-2 - Nov 2022

 **The association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the prevalence of herpes simplex virus**

Objective: Previous studies have reported a potential anti-infection effect for vitamin D. However, the relationship between vitamin D status and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and infection with HSV types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2).

Methods: Data were collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007-2016. The association between 25(OH)D and HSV prevalence was evaluated using propensity score matching (PSM) and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.

Results: Overall,  **14174 participants**  were included in the final analysis. Before PSM, 8639 (60.9%) had positive HSV-1 and 2636 (18.6%) had HSV-2. The HSV-1 and HSV-2 positive groups had more females and older individuals (P<0.05). 

The HSV-2 patients had lower 25(OH)D levels than those with HSV-1. Age and gender did not differ in the groups after PSM (P>0.05).

The 25(OH)D level was significantly lower in the HSV-1 and HSV-2 groups than in the non-HSV infection groups. Multivariate logistic regression showed that serum 25(OH)D level was negatively associated with HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection (OR=0.730 and 0.691, P<0.001, respectively). 

 **Vitamin D deficiency was an independent risk factor for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 (adjusted OR=2.205 and 2.704, P<0.001, respectively).** 

Conclusion: Lower serum 25(OH)D levels correlated significantly with increased HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection risk This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

 **Vitamin D Deficiency or Supplementation and the Risk of Human Herpesvirus Infections or Reactivation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis**

Background

Vitamin D may protect against respiratory virus infections, but any association with herpesviruses is unclear.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review of vitamin D deficiency or supplementation and the risk of 8 human herpesviruses. Six databases and 4 gray literature databases were searched for relevant cohort studies, case–control studies, and clinical trials.

Results

Ten studies were included, all conducted among  **immunosuppressed patients** . There was no evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (pooled risk ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.66–1.7), herpes zoster after transplantation (1 study), or HHV-8 among HIV patients (1 study). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease herpes zoster among hemodialysis patients (1 study) or CMV disease after renal transplantation (1 study), but supplementation was not associated with reduced EBV viral load among multiple sclerosis patients (1 study).

Conclusions

Any association between vitamin D and herpesviruses remains inconclusive. Further studies in the general population are needed.

We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) against herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in Chinese adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). Chinese KPSC members were identified based on self-reported ethnicity or self- reported preferred spoken/written language. Those aged >50 years who received two doses of RZV 4 weeks to < 6 months apart were matched 1:4 to RZV unvaccinated Chinese members and followed through June 2022; second doses were accrued 6/1/2018-12/31/2020. We estimated incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing outcomes (HZ and PHN). Adjusted VE (%) was calculated as (1-aHR)x100.  **3978 RZV vaccinated Chinese members**  were matched to 15,912 RZV unvaccinated Chinese members. The incidence per 1000 person-years (95% CI) of HZ in the vaccinated group was 1.5 (0.9-2.5) and 10.9 (9.8-12.1) in the unvaccinated group; aHR (95% CI) was 0.12 (0.07-0.21). Adjusted VE (95% CI) was 87.6% (78.9-92.7) against HZ. We identified 0 PHN cases in the vaccinated group and 19 in the unvaccinated group. Among Chinese adults aged >50 years, two doses of RZV provided substantial protection against HZ and PHN supporting the real-world effectiveness of the vaccine in this population.

#### Cold Sores (herpes labialis) occur more often in winter is associated with low levels of vitamin D - 2019

 **Vitamin D Levels in Patients with Recurrent Herpes Labialis** 

Viral Immunol . 2019 Jul/Aug;32(6):258-262. [doi: 10.1089/vim.2019.0013](https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2019.0013)

Recurrent infections of herpes simplex virus in the orolabial area are known as recurrent herpes labialis (RHL). Vitamin D has been shown to have an important immunomodulatory role and to be associated with several infectious diseases. This hospital-based case-control study aimed at investigating the association between vitamin D and RHL by comparing vitamin D levels in individuals with and without RHL. Individuals who presented to the dermatology clinic at a state hospital due to RHL (n = 50) and matching control group of healthy volunteers (n = 51) were studied. Their vitamin D levels were measured, stratified based on clinical guidelines, and compared. The average serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels were  **23.8**  ± 15.5 and  **42.0**  ± 26.3 nM in the patient and control groups, with significant differences between their average serum vitamin D levels and vitamin D status. The studied population had serious vitamin D deficiency regardless of having RHL,  **with vitamin D levels below the adequate limits in more than 96% of the population** . Most importantly, the study established a significant association between low serum vitamin D levels and the presence of RHL. Further interventional and pathophysiological studies should clarify the nature and mechanism of the relationship.
