## Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk

## Text extracted from the PDF

Vitamin D de?ciency/insuf?ciency and rickets has increased in all infants as a result of decreased sunlight expo-

sure secondary to changes in lifestyle, dress habits, and use of topical sun-screen preparations. 

To maintain an adequate serum vitamin D concentration, all breastfed infants routinely should receive an oral 

supplement of vitamin D, 400 U per day, beginning at hospital discharge. 133
