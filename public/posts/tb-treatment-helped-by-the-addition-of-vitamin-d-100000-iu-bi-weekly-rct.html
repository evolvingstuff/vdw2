#### Effect of adjunct Vitamin D treatment in vitamin D deficient pulmonary tuberculosis patients: A randomized, double blind, active controlled clinical trial

Indian J Tuberc. 2024 Apr;71(2):170-178. [doi: 10.1016/j.ijtb.2023.04.026.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2023.04.026.) Epub 2023 Apr 29.

Background: Since, Vitamin D &lt;span&gt;[1α,25(OH)2D)]&lt;/span&gt; enhances antimicrobial activity of Innate immunity and modulate Adaptive immune responses, simultaneously, so it play a potential role for balanced immune activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and restricting tissue injuries within the TB patients.(Chun et al., 2011) 9 We aimed to determine the role of adjunct Vitamin D treatment on the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis patients and evaluated the effect of Vitamin D administration on Differential Leucocyte Count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, serum Adenosine deaminase, serum C- reactive protein, Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and Body Weight in Vitamin D deficient pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, interventional, randomized, double blind, parallel group, active controlled clinical trial. Newly diagnosed Vitamin D deficient pulmonary tuberculosis patients were randomly assigned to intervention group (received standard anti-tubercular treatment with adjunct Vitamin D3) and control group (received standard anti-tubercular treatment without adjunct Vitamin D3). Total four doses &lt;span&gt;[each dose of 2.5 mg (100000 IU)]&lt;/span&gt; of Vitamin D3 were given, orally. First dose was given within 7 days of starting anti-tubercular treatment and second, third, fourth dose were given at 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively. At the time of enrollment, we measured all baseline characteristics. During follow-up, we measured the study variables and monitored adverse events at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks. Our safety parameter was serum corrected calcium level to assess the risk of hypercalcemia.

Results: Total 130 pulmonary TB patients, 65 patients in each group, were analyzed. Our study results showed that decrease in Neutrophil count was statistically significant with small effect sizes at every time point of measurement and increase in Lymphocyte count was statistically significant with small and moderate effect sizes at 4, 6 and 8 week for intervention group than for control group. Decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate was statistically significant with small effect sizes at 6 and 8 week, decrease in serum adenosine deaminase and serum C- reactive protein was statistically significant with moderate effect sizes at 4, 6 and 8 week for intervention group than for control group. Increase in Oxygen saturation was statistically significant at 4 week with small effect size and increase in body weight was statistically significant with small effect sizes for intervention group than for control group. No case of hypercalcemia was reported.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest a potential role of adjunctive Vitamin D3 to accelerate resolution of inflammatory responses and improvement in clinical outcomes of pulmonary TB patients.

!!!!Effect of adjunct Vitamin D treatment in vitamin D deficient pulmonary tuberculosis patients: A randomized, double blind, active controlled clinical trial
Indian J Tuberc. 2024 Apr;71(2):170-178. doi: 10.1016/j.ijtb.2023.04.026. Epub 2023 Apr 29.

Background: Since, Vitamin D [1α,25(OH)2D)] enhances antimicrobial activity of Innate immunity and modulate Adaptive immune responses, simultaneously, so it play a potential role for balanced immune activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and restricting tissue injuries within the TB patients.(Chun et al., 2011) 9 We aimed to determine the role of adjunct Vitamin D treatment on the outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis patients and evaluated the effect of Vitamin D administration on Differential Leucocyte Count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, serum Adenosine deaminase, serum C- reactive protein, Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and Body Weight in Vitamin D deficient pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, interventional, randomized, double blind, parallel group, active controlled clinical trial. Newly diagnosed Vitamin D deficient pulmonary tuberculosis patients were randomly assigned to intervention group (received standard anti-tubercular treatment with adjunct Vitamin D3) and control group (received standard anti-tubercular treatment without adjunct Vitamin D3). Total four doses [each dose of 2.5 mg (100000 IU)] of Vitamin D3 were given, orally. First dose was given within 7 days of starting anti-tubercular treatment and second, third, fourth dose were given at 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively. At the time of enrollment, we measured all baseline characteristics. During follow-up, we measured the study variables and monitored adverse events at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks. Our safety parameter was serum corrected calcium level to assess the risk of hypercalcemia.

Results: Total 130 pulmonary TB patients, 65 patients in each group, were analyzed. Our study results showed that decrease in Neutrophil count was statistically significant with small effect sizes at every time point of measurement and increase in Lymphocyte count was statistically significant with small and moderate effect sizes at 4, 6 and 8 week for intervention group than for control group. Decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate was statistically significant with small effect sizes at 6 and 8 week, decrease in serum adenosine deaminase and serum C- reactive protein was statistically significant with moderate effect sizes at 4, 6 and 8 week for intervention group than for control group. Increase in Oxygen saturation was statistically significant at 4 week with small effect size and increase in body weight was statistically significant with small effect sizes for intervention group than for control group. No case of hypercalcemia was reported.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest a potential role of adjunctive Vitamin D3 to accelerate resolution of inflammatory responses and improvement in clinical outcomes of pulmonary TB patients.
