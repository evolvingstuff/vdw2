### Evidence for a u-shaped relationship between prehospital vitamin d status and mortality: a cohort study.

Hellman Memorial Laboratory (K.B.C.), Renal Division, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.

Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between prehospital serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>and the risk of mortality after hospital admission. 

Design: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults hospitalized for  **acute care**  between 1993 and 2011. Setting: The study was conducted at two Boston teaching hospitals. 

Patients: A total of 24 094 adult inpatients participated in the study. 

Intervention: There was no intervention. 

Measurements: All patients had serum 25(OH)D measured before hospitalization. 

The exposure of interest was 25(OH)D categorized as 

* less than 10 ng/mL, 

* 10-19.9 ng/mL, 

* 20-29.9 ng/mL, 

* 30-49.9 ng/mL, 

* 50-59.9 ng/mL, 

* 60-69.9 ng/mL, and 

* 70 ng/mL or greater. 

The main outcome measure was 90-day mortality. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated by multivariable logistic regression with inclusion of potential confounders. 

Results: After adjustment for age, gender, race (white vs nonwhite), patient type (surgical vs medical), season of 25(OH)D draw, and the Deyo-Charlson index, patients with 25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL or 60 ng/mL or greater had higher odds of 90-day mortality compared with patients with levels of 30-49.9 ng/mL [adjusted OR (95% confidence interval) for 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL, 10-19.9 ng/mL, 20-29.9 ng/mL, 50-59.9 ng/mL, 60-69.9 ng/mL, and ≥70 ng/mL was 

* 2.01 (1.68-2.40), 

* 1.89 (1.64-2.18), 

* 1.34 (1.16-1.56), 

* 0.94 (0.69-1.26), 

* 1.52 (1.03-2.25), and 

* 1.69 (1.09-2.61), 

respectively, compared with patients with 25(OH)D levels 30-49.9 ng/mL](adjusted%20OR%20(95%%20confidence%20interval)%20for%2025(OH)D%20<10%20ng/mL,%2010-19.9%20ng/mL,%2020-29.9%20ng/mL,%2050-59.9%20ng/mL,%2060-69.9%20ng/mL,%20and%20≥70%20ng/mL%20was%20

respectively,%20compared%20with%20patients%20with%2025(OH)D%20levels%2030-49.9%20ng/mL). 

Limitations: A causal relationship between either low or high 25(OH)D levels and increased mortality can not necessarily be inferred from this observational study. 

Conclusions: Analysis of 24 094 adult patients showed that 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL and 60 ng/mL or greater before hospitalization were associated with an increased odds of 90-day mortality. Although previous reports have suggested an association between low vitamin D status and mortality, these data raise the issue of potential harm from high serum 25(OH)D levels, provide a rationale for an upper limit to supplementation, and emphasize the need for caution in the use of extremely high doses of vitamin D among patients.

### 25-hydroxyvitamin D and increased all-cause mortality in very old women: the Newcastle 85+ study. (May 2014)

J Intern Med. 2014 May 31. [doi: 10.1111/joim.12273.](https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.12273.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Granic A1, Aspray T, Hill T, Davies K, Collerton J, Ruiz CM, von Zglinicki T, Kirkwood TB, Mathers JC, Jagger C.

OBJECTIVE:

To investigate the associations between low and high concentrations of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and all-cause mortality in very old (≥85 years) men and women over 6 years.

DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS:

Prospective mortality data from 775 participants in the Newcastle 85+ Study were analysed for survival in relation to 25(OH)D (season-specific quartiles and predefined cut-off values) and sex using Cox proportional hazards models. The models were fitted to the entire and restricted (non-users of vitamin D-containing supplements and medication) cohorts.

RESULTS:

For the entire cohort, mortality was higher in both the lowest and highest 25(OH)D season-specific quartiles <span>[SQ1: hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.69, P = 0.04; SQ4: HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.12-1.85, P = 0.004]</span> compared with the combined middle quartiles (SQ2+SQ3), after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. The increased risk for the highest quartile remained significant after further adjustment for lifestyle variables (SQ4: HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.77, P = 0.02), and was seen only in women in sex-specific analyses. Similarly, in sensitivity analyses with predefined 25(OH)D cut-off values, the highest 25(OH)D concentration (≥75 nmol/L) was associated with a  **2.4-fold increased risk of mortality**  in women (restricted cohort) after adjusting for all covariates.

CONCLUSION:

Low and high season-specific 25(OH)D quartiles were associated with increased risks of mortality over 6 years in the very old; this effect was particularly noticeable in women, including those who reported taking vitamin D-containing supplements/medication.
