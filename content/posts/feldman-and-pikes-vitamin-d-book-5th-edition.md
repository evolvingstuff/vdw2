#### [5th edition 2023](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/feldman-and-pike-s-vitamin-d/hewison/978-0-323-91338-6) $187 for hardback or PDF

 **Volume I:**  Biochemistry, Physiology and Diagnostics, international experts in endocrinology, bone biology, and human physiology take readers through the basic research of vitamin D. This impressive reference presents a comprehensive review of the multi-faceted actions of vitamin D relating both to skeletal and extra-skeletal action. Researchers from all areas of vitamin D will gain insight into how clinical observations and practices can feed back into the research cycle and will, therefore, be able to develop more targeted genomic and proteomic insights into the mechanisms of disease.

 **Volume II:**  Health, Disease and Therapy authoritatively covers the evidence for new roles of vitamin D, ranging from organ transplantation to cancer, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and renal disease. The coverage is appropriately broad, drawing on aspects of internal medicine, pediatrics, nutrition, orthopedics, oncology, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, and immunology, as well as, new areas for vitamin D including sports medicine, opthalmology, veterinary medicine and ICU care – including COVID-19. Clinical researchers will gain a strong understanding of the molecular basis for a particular disease and better understand future directions for research in this still-growing field.

> https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-91386-7.00007-6: This chapter describes the metabolic parameters of vitamin D and its metabolites according to the framework of pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of vitamin D is considerably more complex than a standard pharmacological agent, because of the required stepwise hydroxylation into the active form, 1,25(OH)2D, its endogenous, cutaneous synthesis, and presence of vitamin D and its metabolites in the circulation and tissues. Also, its binding to the vitamin D–binding protein (DBP) influences the properties of the vitamin D metabolites. These aspects are discussed throughout this chapter. The absorption, distribution, dose-response, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of vitamin D and its metabolites are reviewed. In addition, we present the current knowledge of factors influencing 25-hydroxyvitamin D half-life, the influence of DBP on vitamin D metabolism, and the differences in pharmacokinetics between bound and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
