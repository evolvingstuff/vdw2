For the third time, it is our pleasure to invite you to participate in the scientific conference "Vitamin D - minimum, maximum, optimum" under the auspices of the European Vitamin D Association (EVIDAS). On 22-23 September 2017 at the Conference Center of the Central Clinical Hospital MSWiA in Warsaw will be held a very interesting scientific meeting with excellent experts from Poland, Europe and the World.

The organization of the next third edition of the conference on vitamin D in Poland - a country where widely disseminated and advertised in the media vitamin D is often seen as a cure for many diseases and disorders - is a big challenge. The increasing number of medical preparations and supplements containing vitamin D, increasing availability in pharmacies, health food stores, online sales, media campaigns and ubiquitous advertising have caused legitimate controversy and security concerns in the medical world. Sales of vitamin D supplements are steadily increasing, while new products, fortified with vitamin K2, further stimulate the market for this vitamin. As a result, we note the dilemma of adverse effects such as increased renal disease, urolithiasis, drug interactions, and other potential adverse effects of vitamin D.

On the other hand, however, the results of research published in reputable medical journals still document many of the benefits of vitamin D to the human body at all stages of its life. Currently reduced vitamin D body mass is seen as an important additional risk factor for many civilization diseases such as

* cancer,

* cardiovascular disease,

* hypertension,

* autoimmune diseases,

* metabolic diseases and disorders,

* immunodeficiency diseases and

* many neuropsychiatric disorders.

The health benefits associated with the use of vitamin D have been the basis for the development and publication of the Central European recommendations for vitamin D deficiency in 2013. Unfortunately, at present, in the public debate, mainly on the Internet, these guidelines are too restrictive. We believe that with the ever-presenting of reliable evidence of the health benefits of vitamin D, the spread of knowledge about the importance of this important vitamin to the health of children, adolescents, the working population and the elderly is justified and targeted. At the same time, we stress the need for rational use of vitamin D supplementation guidelines with regard to safety aspects.

We are convinced that the scientific program of the 3rd edition of the "Vitamin D - minimum, maximum, optimum" conference and the participation of outstanding experts and lecturers from Poland, many European countries, Israel, Canada and the USA will guarantee the highest quality and success of this meeting. At present, it is very interested in the medical environment. We hope that this meeting will create an opportunity for free exchange of opinions, opinions, research achievements and experiences.

We would like to invite you very warmly to participate in the Third International Conference entitled " "Vitamin D - minimum, maximum, optimum" from 22 to 23 September 2017 at the Conference Center of the Central Hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration in Warsaw.
