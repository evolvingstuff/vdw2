## [Leiden Longevity Study](http://blog.vitamindcouncil.org/2012/11/08/study-links-low-vitamin-d-levels-to-longer-lifespan-did-we-hear-that-correctly/) described at Vitamin D Council

Looked at people >89 and their children and used their partners as controls

For the kids of the seniors who were 90+ and had 

64 nmol vs 69 nmol for controls (partners)

2X as many study as controls (why?  Should be about equal)

Average age of kids: 59

Whites only

Did not measure tanning bed nor sun 

Looking carefully: Kids who were offspring of the parents who were > 90 had 4 nmol lower vitamin D level than their spouses.

## Possible conclusion from this data include:

* If your parent lives a long time, you have a behavior that keeps you indoors more

* If your parent lives a long time, your genes allow you to not need as high level of vitamin D in your blood

## How much more IU of vitamin D is needed to typically increase blood level by 4 nnmol?

27 ng:  8 ng per 1000 IU 

4nmol = 1.6 ng = **200 IU**
