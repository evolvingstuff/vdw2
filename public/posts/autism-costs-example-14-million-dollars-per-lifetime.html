#### What are the main factors driving the high cost of autism?  - asked [Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-lifetime-cost-of-a-3HnzHXu7QLKFdfR2vSj3Jw)

The high cost of autism is driven by several key factors:

 **Direct Medical Costs** 

 **Healthcare Expenses** 

Medical care costs range from $6,467 to $18,106 annually for children and $13,580 to $27,159 for adults with autism &amp;nbsp;[1](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puts-a-price-tag-on-the-lifetime-cost-of-autism/)

These expenses increase significantly when comorbidities are present, particularly intellectual disabilities &amp;nbsp;[2](https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/autisms-cost/)

 **Educational and Therapeutic Costs** 

 **Special Education** 

Educational costs significantly exceed medical expenses, ranging from $13,980 to $62,920 per year &amp;nbsp;[1](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puts-a-price-tag-on-the-lifetime-cost-of-autism/)

Specialized behavioral interventions can cost $40,000 to $60,000 annually per child &amp;nbsp;[5](https://www.crossrivertherapy.com/autism/autism-is-expensive)

 **Adult Care Expenses** 

 **Residential Services** 

Adult residential care represents the largest expense component, costing between $18,080 and $36,161 annually &amp;nbsp;[1](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puts-a-price-tag-on-the-lifetime-cost-of-autism/)

This becomes particularly significant over an individual&#39;s lifetime.

 **Lost Productivity** 

 **Family Impact** 

* Parents lose an average of $18,720 annually due to reduced work hours or leaving employment &amp;nbsp;[1](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puts-a-price-tag-on-the-lifetime-cost-of-autism/)

* Mothers experience a 56% reduction in earnings compared to mothers of children without health conditions &amp;nbsp;[1](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puts-a-price-tag-on-the-lifetime-cost-of-autism/)

* Adults with autism face approximately $10,718 in annual lost wages &amp;nbsp;[1](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-puts-a-price-tag-on-the-lifetime-cost-of-autism/)

 **Cost Variations** 

 **Severity and Comorbidity** 

The lifetime cost varies significantly based on intellectual disability:

* $1.4 million for individuals without intellectual disabilities

* $2.4 million for those with intellectual disabilities &amp;nbsp;[4](https://www.myteamaba.com/resources/cost-of-autism-treatment)

 **Socioeconomic Factors** 

Healthcare costs are particularly impacted by:

* Lack of health insurance
