Introduction: Observational studies have shown an association between low vitamin D status and poor outcomes including increased mortality in critically ill patients. Whether this relationship is causal remains unclear to date. 

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single-center trial, five intensive care units assigned a mixed medical and surgical population of 480 adult patients with vitamin D deficiency (≤20 ng/ml) to either vitamin D or placebo. Vitamin D3 was given orally or via nasogastric tube once at a dose of **540,000 IU followed by 5 monthly maintenance doses of 90,000 IU.** 

Results: Vitamin D3 administration led to an immediate and sustained rise of mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the interventional vs. the placebo group: 13.0±4.0 vs.13.1±4.3 (baseline); 35.5±20.6 vs. 14.5±5.1 ng/ml (day 7; P<0.001). The primary endpoint, length of hospital stay, was comparable between groups (median 20.1 vs.  19.3 days, P=0.98). 

 **Hospital- and 6-month mortality rates in contrast, tended to be lower in the vitamin D group <span>[HR 0.81 (95%CI 0.58-1.11), P=0.18 and HR 0.78 (0.58-1.04), P=0.09, respectively]</span>** . 

In the predefined subgroup analysis of patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (≤12 ng/ml, n=200), hospital- and 6-month mortality rates were significantly reduced <span>[HR 0.56 (95%CI 0.35-0.90), P=0.01 and HR 0.60 (0.39-0.93), P=0.02, respectively]</span>. At the 6-month follow up, patients with severe vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not show any significant changes in investigated parameters compared to the placebo group whereas patients with less severe vitamin D deficiency (baseline 25(OH)D level >12 and ≤20 ng/ml) showed significantly improved grip strength of the right hand as well as a higher physical component summary score of the SF-12 questionnaire. Adverse event rates including hypercalcemia, falls and fractures were similar in both groups.

Conclusions: High-dose vitamin D3 in critically ill patients did not change the length of hospital stay but tended to decrease hospital- and 6-month mortality. In patients with severe vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D3 reduced all cause mortality, as compared with placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01130181)
