#### New Study Shows Promise for Natural Support of Autism Symptoms - March 2024

 **[GreenMedInfo](https://greenmedinfo.com/content/new-study-shows-promise-natural-support-autism-symptoms)** 

* &quot;A new double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences shows exciting potential for sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli sprouts, to help ease symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&quot;

   * &quot;After 10 weeks, the sulforaphane group showed significantly greater improvements in irritability scores and hyperactivity/noncompliance scores compared to placebo. However, no differences were seen between groups in other symptom areas like lethargy, stereotypic behavior, or inappropriate speech.&quot;

* &quot; A study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences found that when used as an adjunctive treatment alongside  **risperidone** , sulforaphane significantly improved symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with ASD compared to placebo.&quot;

* &quot;Early studies associate sulforaphane with reduced risks for cardiovascular disease, asthma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and Parkinson&#39;s disease.8 It has been shown to support liver function, blood sugar balance, eye health, skin reactions, detoxification and even slowing the aging process itself. With over 250 recorded health benefits, sulforaphane&#39;s therapeutic potential appears tremendous.9&quot;

* Note: there appears to be no mention in the article that sulforaphane is a VDR activator

!!!!New Study Shows Promise for Natural Support of Autism Symptoms - March 2024
__[https://greenmedinfo.com/content/new-study-shows-promise-natural-support-autism-symptoms|GreenMedInfo]__
*&quot;A new double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences shows exciting potential for sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli sprouts, to help ease symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&quot;
**&quot;After 10 weeks, the sulforaphane group showed significantly greater improvements in irritability scores and hyperactivity/noncompliance scores compared to placebo. However, no differences were seen between groups in other symptom areas like lethargy, stereotypic behavior, or inappropriate speech.&quot;
*&quot; A study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences found that when used as an adjunctive treatment alongside __risperidone__, sulforaphane significantly improved symptoms of irritability and hyperactivity in children with ASD compared to placebo.&quot;
*&quot;Early studies associate sulforaphane with reduced risks for cardiovascular disease, asthma, schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and Parkinson&#39;s disease.8 It has been shown to support liver function, blood sugar balance, eye health, skin reactions, detoxification and even slowing the aging process itself. With over 250 recorded health benefits, sulforaphane&#39;s therapeutic potential appears tremendous.9&quot;

*Efficacy of Sulforaphane in Treatment of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Multi-center Trial - Feb 2024 [https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-022-05784-9]
+&quot;. There were no significant changes in caregiver rated scales between sulforaphane and placebo groups. However, clinician rated scales showed a significant improvement in the sulforaphane group, and one third of participants showed at least a 30% decrease in score by 12 weeks treatment.&quot;
