### Serum 25(OH)D is a 2-year predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiac death and sudden cardiac death  
 in chest pain patients from Northern Argentina.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular risk. 

Vitamin D status is assessed by determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> in serum.

METHODS: We assessed the prognostic utility of 25(OH)D in 982 chest-pain patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) from Salta, Northern Argentina. 2-year follow-up data including all-cause mortality, cardiac death and sudden cardiac death were analyzed in quartiles of 25(OH)D, applying univariate and multivariate analysis.

RESULTS:There were statistically significant changes in seasonal 25(OH)D levels. At follow-up, 119 patients had died. The mean 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower among patients dying than in long-term survivors, both in the total population and in patients with a troponin T (TnT) release (n = 388). When comparing 25(OH)D in the highest quartile to the lowest quartile in a multivariable Cox regression model for all-cause mortality, the hazard ratio (HR) for cardiac death and sudden cardiac death in the total population was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.19-0.73), p = 0.004, 0.23 (95% CI, 0.08-0.67), p = 0.007, and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.11-0.94), p = 0.038, respectively. In patients with TnT release, the respective HR was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.10-0.54), p = 0.001, 0.18 (95% CI, 0.05-0.60), p = 0.006 and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.07-0.89), p = 0.033. 25(OH)D had no prognostic value in patients with no TnT release.

CONCLUSION:Vitamin D was shown to be a useful biomarker for prediction of mortality when obtained at admission in chest pain patients with suspected ACS.

### For all patients, the less the vitamin D the more likely to die

### For patients with heart damage (TnT), low vitamin D was a good predictor of death within 750 days

 **Troponin test** 

The troponin test measures the levels of certain proteins called troponin T and troponin I in the blood. 

These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as a heart attack. 

The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin T and I there will be in the blood.
