Aims

Plasma levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D) have been suggested as a predictor for developing type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate if a measurement of plasma 25(OH)D could predict the development of type 2 diabetes in a cohort of 222,311 individuals from primary healthcare in Denmark.

Methods

The CopD-study database containing data from the Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory on blood tests conducted from April 2004 to January 2012 was used for identification of the study population. Incident type 2 diabetes was then defined as having at least two redeemed prescriptions of antidiabetics or at least two hospital contacts due to type 2 diabetes or one redeemed prescription and one hospital contact regarding type 2 diabetes.

Results

A total of 222,311 individuals were included in the study, of whom 7652 (3.4%) developed type 2 diabetes during the follow-up period of at least one year. Individuals who developed type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower median 25(OH)D level than individuals in the non-diabetes group. The hazard ratio for development of type 2 diabetes increased by  **15% per 10 n mol/L decrease in 25(OH)D level** .

Conclusion

In this study of 222,311 persons from primary health care in Denmark, we found a clear inverse relationship between 25(OH)D and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Further studies should be conducted to clarify the mechanisms behind the relationship between 25(OH)D and type 2 diabetes and the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on the development of type 2 diabetes.
