Background

Vitamin D is involved in a wide variety of biological processes including bone metabolism, modulation of the immune response, and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The present study aimed to investigate vitamin D status and the genetic polymorphism BsmI (A/G) of vitamin D receptor (VDR) among a group of Egyptian female patients with breast cancer.

Methods

The current study included 60 female patients diagnosed as breast cancer (BC) attending Mansoura Oncology Center, Mansoura University, and 60 age-matched healthy control females. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D level was measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. A polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and fragment analysis were performed to determine the VDR BsmI (A/G) polymorphism.

Results

25(OH) vitamin D levels were significantly lower in the patients with BC (22.1 ± 10.9 ng/ml) compared to controls (41.2 ± 11.22 ng/ml) (p   0.001). Vitamin D deficiency- insufficiency was reported in 76.7% of BC patients and 20% of the controls (P   0.001,  **OR = 13.1** , 95%CI = 5.5 - 31.4). 

Bb genotype was statistically higher in the BC patients than in the healthy controls (P   0.001). 

* 81.2% of BC patients were of Bb genotype, 

* 10.9% of BB genotype and 

* 4.3% of bb genotype, 

while in controls, 33.3% for each genotype. 

No statistically significant difference in allele frequency was observed between the two studied groups. 

 **Carriers of Bb genotype had 4.6 times**  increased risk of developing breast cancer (95% confidence interval of 2.0–10.3) when compared to other genotypes.

Conclusion

A significant association exists between vitamin D deficiency and the risk of breast cancer. B allele or Bb genotype of VDR may be a susceptibility risk factor for BC development.
