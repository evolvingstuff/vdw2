* No - these tests look at the underlying DNA sequence, using technologies that are “blind” to the presence or absence of epigenetic marks on the DNA.

* There are some direct-to-consumer tests that look at epigenetic changes, but they’re specifically marketed as epigenetic tests.

#### Amount of response to Vitamin D is passed on to future generations – May 2018

 **Vitamin D Genomics: From In Vitro to In Vivo.** 

Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2018 May 23;9:250. [doi: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00250.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00250.)

The vitamin D3 metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[1,25(OH)2D3]</span> is the exclusive high-affinity ligand of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a transcription factor with direct effects on gene expression. Transcriptome- and epigenome-wide data obtained in THP-1 human monocytes are the basis of the chromatin model of vitamin D signaling. The model describes, how VDR's spatio-temporal binding profile provides key insight into the pleiotropic action of vitamin D. The transcription of some 300 primary target genes is significantly modulated through the action of genomic VDR binding sites in concert with the pioneer transcription factor PU.1 and the chromatin organizer CTCF. In parallel, the short-term vitamin D intervention study VitDbol (NCT02063334) was designed, in order to extrapolate insight into vitamin D signaling from in vitro to in vivo. 

Before and 24 h after a vitamin D3 bolus chromatin and RNA were prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells for epigenome- and transcriptome-wide analysis. The study subjects showed a personalized response to vitamin D and could be distinguished into high, mid, and low responders. Comparable principles of vitamin D signaling were identified in vivo and in vitro concerning target gene responses as well as changes in chromatin accessibility.

In conclusion, short-term vitamin D supplementation studies represent a new type of safe in vivo investigations demonstrating that vitamin D and its metabolites have direct effects on the human epigenome and modulate the response of the transcriptome in a personalized fashion.

#### In vivo response of the human epigenome to vitamin D: A Proof-of-principle study.

J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2018 Jun;180:142-148. [doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2018.01.002.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2018.01.002.) Epub 2018 Jan 6.

In vitro cell culture studies showed that the hormonal form of vitamin D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, significantly (p < 0.05) affects the human epigenome at thousands of genomic loci. Phase II of the VitDbol vitamin D intervention trial (NCT02063334) involved a proof-of-principle study of one individual, who was exposed three times every 28 days to an oral bolus (2000 μg) of vitamin D3. Blood samples were taken directly before each supplementation as well as one and two days after, chromatin was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells without any further in vitro culture and at all nine time points epigenome-wide chromatin accessibility was assessed by applying FAIRE-seq (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing). The vitamin D3 bolus resulted in an average raise in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) serum concentration of 11.9 and 19.4 nM within one and two days, respectively. Consistently accessible chromatin was detected at 5205 genomic loci, the 853 most prominent of which a self-organizing map algorithm classified into early, delayed and non-responding genomic regions: 70 loci showed already after one day and 361 sites after two days significant (p < 0.0001) chromatin opening or closing. Interestingly, more than half of these genomic regions overlap with transcription start sites, but the change of chromatin accessibility at these sites has no direct effect on the transcriptome. Some of the vitamin D responsive chromatin sites cluster at specific loci within the human genome, the most prominent of which is the human leukocyte antigen region in chromosome 6. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that under in vivo conditions a rather minor rise in 25(OH)D3 serum levels is sufficient to result in significant changes at hundreds of sites within the epigenome of human leukocytes.
