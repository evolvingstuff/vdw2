The researchers looked for the gene variant in more than 3,000 families of unaffected parents with a child with MS, 

and found 35 parents who carried one copy of this variant along with one normal copy.

 **In every one of these 35 cases, their child with MS had inherited the mutated version of the gene.** 

The likelihood of this gene’s transmission being unconnected to the MS is billion to one against

The probability of both is 1 billion (the prob of all 3 cases of genetic rickets having MS) X the prob of 35/35 getting gene variant

"Odds of  **30 quintillion to one against** ," George Ebers (30,000,000,000,000,000,000)

On the very rare occasions when people inherit two copies of the  **CYP27B1**  gene variant, they develop a genetic form of rickets (a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency). 

Norwegian collaborators found three such cases in the whole of Norway, and the researchers found that these three people all had MS as well.

"Current opinion suggests that a combination of genetic predisposition, environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight and possibly some sort of trigger, such as a viral infection, interact in some way to start the development of MS," Paul Comer of the charity MS Trust said.

Vitamin D has been studied for over a century and its functions related to calcium homeostasis are well established. Over the last 30 years or so it has become increasingly clear that it has a wider role in physiology and, importantly, also in disease. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to multiple sclerosis (MS); however the molecular mechanisms of this association were poorly understood. Recent technological advances have provided major insights as to how vitamin D may exert its role, particularly through the actions of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). In this review we aim to highlight the importance of the interaction between vitamin D and MS associated genes which provide a biological basis for the association between vitamin D and MS risk.
