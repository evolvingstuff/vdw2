!!!!Sample of studies in VitaminDWiki
*((Third study found that Infants needed 1600 IU of vitamin D – JAMA RCT May 2013))
**Yet Canada still says that 400 IU is enough for virtually everyone
*((2400 IU of vitamin D needed to get most Northern adults above 20 ng – June 2020))
*((10,000 IU of Vitamin D for 7 years with no excessive Calcium in 4,800 patients – Dec 2018))
*((Vitamin D - at least 4,000 IU to achieve 40-60 ng and reduce risk of early death – Holick June 2018))
*((Vitamin D supplementation guidelines (adults – 50,000 IU per week) – Feb 2017))
*((Vitamin D math mistake had been made, adults need at least 8000 IU – July 2017)) 
**they admitted their mistake, but did not charge their report, which Canada and many other countries copied
*((1000 IU should be the new vitamin D RDA (if you think 20 ng is enough) - May 2017))
*((Overview Deficiency of vitamin D))
*((Overview How Much vitamin D))
*((Vitamin D levels have been crashing since 1995 (Polish Children, Elite Military, etc) ))
