 **Clipped from page 45** 

* It is as though there is something fundamental that is occurring, that increases susceptibility to a number of diseases, fatal or not.

* There is a parallel and that is AIDS, in which T-cell immunity is suppressed leading to the development of a number of unusual and fatal infections and malignancies. it has been suggested in Australia that this is happening now, what we might call  **VAIDS, vaccine induced acquired immune deficiency syndrome.** 

* It is possible that vitamin D deficiency is driving the immune deficiency, as we know that vitamin D is essential for defensive immunity and is a powerful stimulator of the vitally important T-cells.

The "GREEN" person started with a high level of Vitammin D

This assumes no vitamin D supplementation by supplements, sun, etc.
