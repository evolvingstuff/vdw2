#### Daily vs. monthly oral vitamin D3 for treatment of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants: a randomized controlled trial

J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab . 2023 May 18. [doi: 10.1515/jpem-2023-0146](https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2023-0146) PDF is behind paywall

Anupriya Gora 1, Preeti Singh 2, Ekta Debnath 3, Rajeev Kumar Malhotra 4, Anju Seth 2

Objectives: Compare the efficacy and safety of daily vs. monthly oral vitamin D3 in treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants.

Methods: 90 infants with symsptomatic vitamin D deficiency were randomized into Daily (D) <span>[46 infants]</span> and Bolus (B) <span>[44 infants]</span> groups to receive oral vitamin D3, daily (2000 IU/day) and bolus (60,000 IU/month) for three months respectively. Both groups received daily oral calcium @50 mg/kg/day. Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, urine calcium: creatinine ratio and radiological score were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, 78 infants were available for evaluation of efficacy and safety of both regimens.

Results: Both regimens led to a statistically significant increase in Ca and P levels and fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no inter-group difference. Infants in group D had statistically significant higher mean 25(OH)D levels as compared to group B at 4 weeks (group D 130.89 ± 43.43 nmol/L, group B - 108.25 ± 32.40 nmol/L; p - 0.012) and 12 weeks (group D - 193.69 ± 32.47 nmol/L, group B - 153.85 ± 33.60 nmol/L; p<0.001). Eight infants [group D - 6/41 (14.6 %); group B - 2/37 (5.4 %), p=0.268](group%20D%20-%206/41%20(14.6%20%);%20group%20B%20-%202/37%20(5.4%20%),%20p=0.268) developed mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia without hypercalciuria at 12 weeks that corrected spontaneously within a week.

Conclusions: Both daily and monthly oral vitamin D3 in equivalent doses are efficacious and safe for treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants.
