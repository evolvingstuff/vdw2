BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D may influence pregnancy and infant outcomes, especially infant respiratory health. This study aimed to examine vitamin D status in pregnant women with asthma, and whether higher vitamin D levels are associated with fewer adverse respiratory outcomes in their infants.

METHODS:

Pregnant women with asthma, recruited from John Hunter Hospital Newcastle Australia (latitude 33°S), had serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25(OH)D) measured at 16 and 35 weeks gestation. Infant respiratory outcomes were collected at 12 months by parent-report questionnaire. Mother-infant dyads were grouped by serum 25(OH)D during pregnancy: 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L (at both time-points) versus 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L (at one or both time-points).

RESULTS:

In 52 pregnant women with asthma, mean serum 25(OH)D levels were 

* 61 (range 26-110) nmol/L at 16 weeks, and 

* 65 (range 32-116) nmol/L at 35 weeks, gestation. 

Thirty-one (60%) women had 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L at both time-points; 21 (40%) had 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L at one or both time-points. 

Maternal 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L during pregnancy was associated with a higher proportion of infants with "wheeze ever" at 12 months, compared with 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L (71 versus 43%, p = .04). 

Infant acute-care presentations (45% versus 13%, p = .02) and oral corticosteroid use (26 versus 4%, p = .03) due to "asthma/wheezing" were higher in the maternal group with 25(OH)D < 75 nmol/L, versus ≥75 nmol/L.

CONCLUSIONS:

Most pregnant women with asthma had low vitamin D status, which persisted across gestation. Low maternal vitamin D status was associated with greater risk of adverse respiratory outcomes in their infants, a group at high risk of developing childhood asthma.
