* “The results of the study confirmed that skin UVB exposure significantly increased gut microbial diversity, but only in the 12 subjects who were not taking vitamin D supplementation.”

* “UVB exposure boosted the richness and evenness of their microbiome to levels indistinguishable from the supplemented group, whose microbiome was not significantly changed.”

#### The Study: Skin Exposure to Narrow Band Ultraviolet (UVB) Light Modulates the Human Intestinal Microbiome

 **Note: Some who had high level of Vitamin D before had no change or even reduced levels after UVB**
