#### [Suite 101](http://www.suite101.com/content/the-flu-vaccine-should-i-get-the-flu-shot-a335923) Jan 22, 2011

“According to the Cochrane Foundation, over 200 viruses cause influenza and flu-like symptoms such as headaches, runny nose, aches and pains, fever, and coughs. They rarely lead to serious illness or death, and providing a single flu vaccine to protect against these viruses is impossible.

The  **Cochrane study found that in the highly unlikely scenario of the vaccine matching the predominant flu strains circulating that season, one in a hundred people who got the flu shot developed flu symptoms compared to two in a hundred who did not** . Hardly a ringing endorsement for the benefits of the vaccine!”

##### The following graph from Cochrane shows that vaccinating more people does NOT decrease the rate of flu attacks.

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/flu-vaccination-vs-attack.jpg" alt="image">

If more vaccination decreased flu attacks, the data from around the world would have followed the (added)  **pink line.** 

Many observers comment that the flu vaccine is not much better than a placebo.

“Flu season shots, you see, simply don't work on 99 out of 100 people”.

“In other words, you would have to vaccinate 100 people to reduce the number of people showing influenza symptoms by just one.

The vaccine makes no difference at all for ninety-nine percent of the people vaccinated!”
