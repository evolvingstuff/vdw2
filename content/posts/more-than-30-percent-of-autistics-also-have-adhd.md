#### I’ve lived with ADHD and autism all my life – this is what it’s like to have both - Nov 2024

 **[Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/living-with-audhd-autism-and-adhd/?WT.mc_id=e_DM452483&WT.tsrc=email&etype=Edi_Hea_New&utmsource=email&utm_medium=Edi_Hea_New20241112&utm_campaign=DM452483)** 

* "Until 2013, autism and ADHD couldn’t be diagnosed in the same person. Today, researchers have found that there is a 50 to 70 per cent crossover between these neurodevelopmental conditions, which is increasingly being referred to as  **AuDHD** ."

* "Autistic women are twice as likely as autistic men to attempt suicide, with autistic people nine times more likely to die by suicide than the general population."

* "Nearly one in four women with ADHD have attempted suicide, with a five times higher risk of suicide linked to the condition."

 **The typical traits of someone with AuDHD**  By Dr Becky Quicke, a clinical psychologist

* Enjoying the fun and stimulation of being with others whilst also feeling socially anxious and awkward and being extremely exhausted afterwards.

* Having a strong need for predictability whilst also easily becoming bored of routines.

* Having lots of ideas but wanting everything to be done to perfection, so you feel stuck and do nothing.

* Going “all in” on a hobby, interest or passion, but frequently changing focus.

* Desperately wanting to complete tasks but struggling with procrastination, or getting into the zone.

* A quick thinking brain that reads the situation extremely quickly so nobody would ever guess the anxiety and confusion underneath.

* Craving excitement but getting easily overwhelmed, so struggling with both understimulation and overstimulation.
