INTRODUCTION: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Bone manifestations of RTT include osteopenia and fractures. Studies addressing serum vitamin D levels in RTT patients are scarce.

GOALS: 1. To determine prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in RTT patients, 2. To compare serum vitamin D levels between patients with RTT and other neurological diseases, 3. To explore correlation between demographic and clinical characteristics of RTT patients and vitamin D levels.

METHODS: Demographic and clinical characteristics included age, BMI z-score, mutation status, Clinical Severity Score, presence of epilepsy, number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), history of fractures, scoliosis and ambulation ability. Laboratory parameters included serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium and alkaline phosphatase.

RESULTS: The study included 35 RTT patients and 35 age-matched females with other neurological diseases. The median serum 25(OH)D in RTT group was 26.25 nmol/L, with values below 75 nmol/L in all participants. Severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was detected in 17/35 (48.6%) patients. Median 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in RTT patients than in controls. The risk for fracture by 12 years of age in RTT patients was 35.3%. Inverse correlation of 25(OH)D level to age and PTH level was detected. Patients receiving antiepileptic polytherapy had 3.3 times greater chance for severe vitamin D deficiency than patients with monotherapy.

CONCLUSION: Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in RTT patients is higher than in patients with other neurological diseases. 

High risk for vitamin D deficiency should be accounted for in the strategy of antiepileptic treatment in RTT, especially when polytherapy is considered.

 **49% had <10 ng/ml of vitamin D  
3.3X more likely to have < 10 ng/ml if taking multiple antiepileptic drugs  
Alternate hypothesis:  Severe Ritt ==> polytherapy &l low vitamin D** 

 **Do vitamin D levels become low only AFTER seizures start (age 3)? (see chart below)**

#### Chart-GPT description of Rett Syndrome - Jan 2024

Rett Syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder that primarily affects girls and is usually discovered in the first two years of life. It leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child's life: their ability to speak, walk, eat, and even breathe easily. The hallmark of Rett Syndrome is near constant repetitive hand movements while awake. The syndrome is often misdiagnosed as autism, cerebral palsy, or non-specific developmental delay.

Rett Syndrome is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that is needed for brain development and acts as one of the many biochemical switches that can either increase gene expression or tell other genes when to turn off and stop producing their own unique proteins. Because the disorder occurs on the X chromosome, it primarily affects girls. Boys who have the mutations in the MECP2 gene usually die shortly after birth.

The symptoms of Rett Syndrome include slowed growth, problems with hand movements and coordination, repetitive hand movements such as wringing and washing, walking abnormalities, and intellectual disability. There may also be problems with breathing, seizures, scoliosis, and sleep disturbances.

Currently, there's no cure for Rett Syndrome, and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. A multidisciplinary approach involving regular medical care, physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy can help children and their families cope with the various symptoms of the disorder.

 **Compare Rett to Autism** 

Rett Syndrome is not a form of autism, although it shares some similarities with autism spectrum disorders and is often initially misdiagnosed as autism. Both Rett Syndrome and autism are neurodevelopmental disorders, and they can have overlapping symptoms, especially in early stages. These may include impaired social interaction, language difficulties, and repetitive behaviors. However, Rett Syndrome has distinct features and a known genetic cause that sets it apart from autism.

​

 **Key differences include:** 

1.  **Genetic Cause** : Rett Syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome. Autism spectrum disorders, meanwhile, have a more complex and less well-understood set of genetic and environmental risk factors.

1.  **Progressive Nature** : Rett Syndrome is a progressive disorder, meaning that children with Rett Syndrome typically develop normally for the first few months or years of life before experiencing a loss of skills and abilities. Autism does not typically involve this kind of regression, although there can be varying degrees of developmental delay.

1.  **Physical Symptoms** : Children with Rett Syndrome often develop distinctive hand movements, such as wringing or repetitive clapping, and may have problems with physical coordination and movement. These physical symptoms are not characteristic of autism.

1.  **Gender Prevalence** : Rett Syndrome almost exclusively affects girls, due to its link with the X chromosome. Autism spectrum disorders are more common in boys.

In summary, while Rett Syndrome and autism can appear similar in early stages, they are distinct disorders with different causes, symptoms, and progression.
