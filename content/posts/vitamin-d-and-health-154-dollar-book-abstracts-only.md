#### Chapter One - Vitamin D and immune system

Geoffrey Brown, Aleksandra Marchwicka, Ewa Marcinkowska

Pages 1-41

The active metabolite of vitamin D 1,25(OH)2D is well known for its role in regulating calcium-phosphate homeostasis of the human body. However, the immunomodulating activity of 1,25(OH)2D has been known for many years. There are numerous reports correlating low vitamin D levels in blood serum with the onset of autoimmune diseases and with the severe course of acute infections. In this chapter, we address the role of 1,25(OH)2D in these diseases, and we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of 1,25(OH)2D in immune cells.

#### Chapter Two - Vitamin D and bone health: What vitamin D can and cannot do

Michael F. Holick

Pages 43-66

Historically vitamin D deficiency had devastating consequences for children causing rickets resulting in severe bone deformities often leading to death. The mystery of the cause of rickets finally came to light when it was observed that cod liver oil and sunlight could prevent and cure rickets. The first vitamin D to be discovered was vitamin D2 from ergosterol in ultraviolet irradiated yeast. Vitamin D3 was discovered from UV exposure to the skin. Investigations revealed the two major functions of vitamin D were to increase intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption and mobilize calcium from the skeleton to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Later studies demonstrated that vitamin D does not have an active role in bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism increasing bone resorption. As a result, this decreases bone mineral content and compromises the architectural integrity increasing risk for fracture. Vitamin D deficiency has also been shown to enhance aging of the bone causing cracks and enhancing bone fractures. Vitamin D deficiency also causes osteomalacia. Therefore, vitamin D sufficiency is extremely important to maximize bone health throughout life. It helps to prevent bone loss, but it cannot restore bone loss due to increased bone resorption that can occur under a variety of circumstances including menopause. The Endocrine Society Guidelines recommends for all ages that adequate vitamin D obtained from the sun, foods and supplements is necessary in order to maintain a circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of at least 30 ng/mL for maximum bone health.

#### Chapter Three - Vitamin D and cardiovascular diseases

Valentina Milazzo, Nicola Cosentino, Filippo Trombara, Giancarlo Marenzi Pages 68-91

Vitamin D has an established role in calcium homeostasis but its deficiency is emerging also as a new risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In particular, several epidemiological and clinical studies have reported a close association between low vitamin D levels and several cardiovascular risk factors and major CVDs, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

In all these clinical settings, vitamin D deficiency seems to predispose to increased morbidity, mortality, and recurrent cardiovascular events. Despite this growing evidence, interventional trials with supplementation of vitamin D in patients at risk of or with established CVD are still controversial.

In this chapter, we summarize the currently available evidence on the links between vitamin D deficiency and major cardiovascular risk factors and CVD, in terms of both clinical relevance and potential therapeutic implications.

#### Chapter Four - Vitamin D and cancer

Ranjana P. Bird Pages 92-159

The role of vitamin D in the prevention of chronic diseases including cancer, has received a great deal of attention during the past few decades. The term “Cancer” represents multiple disease states with varying biological complexities. The strongest link between vitamin D and cancer is provided by ecological and studies like observational, in preclinical models. It is apparent that vitamin D exerts diverse biological responses in a tissue specific manner. Moreover, several human factors could affect bioactivity of vitamin D. The mechanism(s) underlying vitamin D initiated anti-carcinogenic effects are diverse and includes changes at the muti-system levels. The oncogenic environment could easily corrupt the traditional role of vitamin D or could ensure resistance to vitamin D mediated responses. Several researchers have identified gaps in our knowledge pertaining to the role of vitamin D in cancer. Further areas are identified to solidify the role of vitamin D in cancer control strategies.

#### Chapter Five - Diabetes and vitamin D: The effect of insulin sensitivity and gut microbial health

Denise K. Daley, Semone B. Myrie Pages 160-184

Current global estimation suggests that about 10% of adults worldwide have diabetes, thus, various strategies are needed to address the issue, including dietary factors such as vitamin D. Various studies have suggested an inverse associations between vitamin D and the risks and pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes (type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes). The underlying mechanism is not fully understood; however, the expression of vitamin D receptors in pancreatic beta cells suggests an important physiological role for vitamin D in beta cell function. Vitamin D deficiency may impair blood glucose control and decrease insulin sensitivity by reducing insulin secretion from beta cells. Many studies suggest that vitamin D intervention may be beneficial; however, there is inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on reducing the risks or managing the pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes. Part of the pathogenesis of vitamin D for reducing diabetes is thought to be related to its impact on gut microbiota profile, via the suggested prebiotic properties of vitamin D.

#### Chapter Six - Vitamin D, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia

M. Kyla Shea, Andrew Y. Xuan, Sarah L. Booth Pages 185-219

Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate age-related cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, the predominant type of dementia. Rodent studies have provided insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. However, inconsistencies with respect to age, sex, and genetic background of the rodent models used poses some limitations regarding scientific rigor and translation. Several human observational studies have evaluated the association of vitamin D status with cognitive decline and dementia, and the results are conflicting. Randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have included cognitive outcomes. However, most of the available trials have not been designed specifically to test the effect of vitamin D on age-related cognitive decline and dementia, so it remains questionable how much additional vitamin D will improve cognitive performance. Here we evaluate the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding the role of vitamin D in AD, cognitive decline, dementia.

#### Chapter Seven - Vitamin D and obesity

Chan Yoon Park, Sung Nim Han Pages 221-247

An inverse association between vitamin D status and obesity has been reported across diverse populations and age groups in humans. In animal model of diet-induced obesity, dysregulation of vitamin D metabolism has been observed. However, the causal relationship between vitamin D status and obesity is not conclusive. Several explanations, such as volumetric dilution, sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue, and limited sunlight exposure, have been suggested as the underlying mechanisms linking poor vitamin D status and obesity. Vitamin D can modulate adipose tissue biology, spanning from adipocyte differentiation to adipocyte apoptosis and energy metabolism, indicating its potential impact on adiposity. In this chapter, we will review the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and determinants of vitamin D deficiency among different populations, as well as changes in vitamin D metabolism associated with obesity. Additionally, we will review vitamin D’s regulation of adipogenesis and lipogenesis at the cellular level in order to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking vitamin D levels and obesity.

#### Chapter Eight - Vitamin D and celiac disease

Silvia Trasciatti, Fabio Grizzi Pages 249-270

Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated condition affecting the small intestine. Its reported global prevalence falls within the range of 0.7% to 1.4%. Notably, historically, higher rates, reaching 1% in Western Ireland, have been documented. Recent research has even revealed prevalence rates as elevated as 2% in northern Europe. These findings underscore the urgency for swift and cost-effective diagnosis, especially in individuals identified through screening efforts. At present, the diagnosis of CD relies on a multifaceted approach involving positive serological markers such as IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies (anti-EMA). These serological findings are assessed in conjunction with classical histological alterations, as outlined in the Marsh classification. CD is an inflammatory condition triggered by the consumption of gluten, resulting from intricate interactions between genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. CD is linked to malabsorption, leading to nutritional deficiencies. Individuals with CD are required to adhere to a gluten-free diet, which itself can lead to nutrient deficiencies. One such deficiency includes vitamin D, and there is substantial experimental evidence supporting the notion of a bidirectional relationship between CD and vitamin D status. A low level of vitamin D has a detrimental impact on the clinical course of the disease. Here we summarize the key characteristics of CD and explore the prominent roles of vitamin D in individuals with CD.

#### Chapter Nine - Vitamin D and viral infections: Infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancers

William B. Grant Pages 271-314

Viruses can cause many human diseases. Three types of human diseases caused by viruses are discussed in this chapter: infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. The infectious diseases included in this chapter include three respiratory tract diseases: influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, the mosquito-borne dengue virus diseases are discussed. Vitamin D can reduce risk, severity, and mortality of the respiratory tract diseases and possibly for dengue virus. Many autoimmune diseases are initiated by the body’s reaction to a viral infection. The protective role of vitamin D in Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis is discussed. There are a few cancers linked to viral infections. Such cancers include cervical cancer, head and neck cancers, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and liver cancer. Vitamin D plays an important role in reducing risk of cancer incidence and mortality, although not as strongly for viral-linked cancers as for other types of cancer.

!!!!Chapter One - Vitamin D and immune system
Geoffrey Brown, Aleksandra Marchwicka, Ewa Marcinkowska
Pages 1-41
The active metabolite of vitamin D 1,25(OH)2D is well known for its role in regulating calcium-phosphate homeostasis of the human body. However, the immunomodulating activity of 1,25(OH)2D has been known for many years. There are numerous reports correlating low vitamin D levels in blood serum with the onset of autoimmune diseases and with the severe course of acute infections. In this chapter, we address the role of 1,25(OH)2D in these diseases, and we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of 1,25(OH)2D in immune cells.

!!!!Chapter Two - Vitamin D and bone health: What vitamin D can and cannot do
Michael F. Holick
Pages 43-66
Historically vitamin D deficiency had devastating consequences for children causing rickets resulting in severe bone deformities often leading to death. The mystery of the cause of rickets finally came to light when it was observed that cod liver oil and sunlight could prevent and cure rickets. The first vitamin D to be discovered was vitamin D2 from ergosterol in ultraviolet irradiated yeast. Vitamin D3 was discovered from UV exposure to the skin. Investigations revealed the two major functions of vitamin D were to increase intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption and mobilize calcium from the skeleton to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Later studies demonstrated that vitamin D does not have an active role in bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism increasing bone resorption. As a result, this decreases bone mineral content and compromises the architectural integrity increasing risk for fracture. Vitamin D deficiency has also been shown to enhance aging of the bone causing cracks and enhancing bone fractures. Vitamin D deficiency also causes osteomalacia. Therefore, vitamin D sufficiency is extremely important to maximize bone health throughout life. It helps to prevent bone loss, but it cannot restore bone loss due to increased bone resorption that can occur under a variety of circumstances including menopause. The Endocrine Society Guidelines recommends for all ages that adequate vitamin D obtained from the sun, foods and supplements is necessary in order to maintain a circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of at least 30 ng/mL for maximum bone health.

!!!!Chapter Three - Vitamin D and cardiovascular diseases
Valentina Milazzo, Nicola Cosentino, Filippo Trombara, Giancarlo Marenzi Pages 68-91
Vitamin D has an established role in calcium homeostasis but its deficiency is emerging also as a new risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In particular, several epidemiological and clinical studies have reported a close association between low vitamin D levels and several cardiovascular risk factors and major CVDs, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.

In all these clinical settings, vitamin D deficiency seems to predispose to increased morbidity, mortality, and recurrent cardiovascular events. Despite this growing evidence, interventional trials with supplementation of vitamin D in patients at risk of or with established CVD are still controversial.

In this chapter, we summarize the currently available evidence on the links between vitamin D deficiency and major cardiovascular risk factors and CVD, in terms of both clinical relevance and potential therapeutic implications.

!!!!Chapter Four - Vitamin D and cancer
Ranjana P. Bird Pages 92-159
The role of vitamin D in the prevention of chronic diseases including cancer, has received a great deal of attention during the past few decades. The term “Cancer” represents multiple disease states with varying biological complexities. The strongest link between vitamin D and cancer is provided by ecological and studies like observational, in preclinical models. It is apparent that vitamin D exerts diverse biological responses in a tissue specific manner. Moreover, several human factors could affect bioactivity of vitamin D. The mechanism(s) underlying vitamin D initiated anti-carcinogenic effects are diverse and includes changes at the muti-system levels. The oncogenic environment could easily corrupt the traditional role of vitamin D or could ensure resistance to vitamin D mediated responses. Several researchers have identified gaps in our knowledge pertaining to the role of vitamin D in cancer. Further areas are identified to solidify the role of vitamin D in cancer control strategies.

!!!!Chapter Five - Diabetes and vitamin D: The effect of insulin sensitivity and gut microbial health
Denise K. Daley, Semone B. Myrie Pages 160-184
Current global estimation suggests that about 10% of adults worldwide have diabetes, thus, various strategies are needed to address the issue, including dietary factors such as vitamin D. Various studies have suggested an inverse associations between vitamin D and the risks and pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes (type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes). The underlying mechanism is not fully understood; however, the expression of vitamin D receptors in pancreatic beta cells suggests an important physiological role for vitamin D in beta cell function. Vitamin D deficiency may impair blood glucose control and decrease insulin sensitivity by reducing insulin secretion from beta cells. Many studies suggest that vitamin D intervention may be beneficial; however, there is inconclusive evidence of the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on reducing the risks or managing the pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes. Part of the pathogenesis of vitamin D for reducing diabetes is thought to be related to its impact on gut microbiota profile, via the suggested prebiotic properties of vitamin D.

!!!!Chapter Six - Vitamin D, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia
M. Kyla Shea, Andrew Y. Xuan, Sarah L. Booth Pages 185-219

Vitamin D has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate age-related cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, the predominant type of dementia. Rodent studies have provided insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. However, inconsistencies with respect to age, sex, and genetic background of the rodent models used poses some limitations regarding scientific rigor and translation. Several human observational studies have evaluated the association of vitamin D status with cognitive decline and dementia, and the results are conflicting. Randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have included cognitive outcomes. However, most of the available trials have not been designed specifically to test the effect of vitamin D on age-related cognitive decline and dementia, so it remains questionable how much additional vitamin D will improve cognitive performance. Here we evaluate the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding the role of vitamin D in AD, cognitive decline, dementia.

Chan Yoon Park, Sung Nim Han Pages 221-247
An inverse association between vitamin D status and obesity has been reported across diverse populations and age groups in humans. In animal model of diet-induced obesity, dysregulation of vitamin D metabolism has been observed. However, the causal relationship between vitamin D status and obesity is not conclusive. Several explanations, such as volumetric dilution, sequestration of vitamin D into adipose tissue, and limited sunlight exposure, have been suggested as the underlying mechanisms linking poor vitamin D status and obesity. Vitamin D can modulate adipose tissue biology, spanning from adipocyte differentiation to adipocyte apoptosis and energy metabolism, indicating its potential impact on adiposity. In this chapter, we will review the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and determinants of vitamin D deficiency among different populations, as well as changes in vitamin D metabolism associated with obesity. Additionally, we will review vitamin D’s regulation of adipogenesis and lipogenesis at the cellular level in order to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking vitamin D levels and obesity.
