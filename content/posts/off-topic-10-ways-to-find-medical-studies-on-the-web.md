"the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers"

 **<span style="color:#F00;">74,000,000</span>**  PDFs as of June 2019

Sci-Hub finds a free PDF associated with PubMed# or DOI (Digital Object Idenfier) #

It gets copies via University subscriptions

PDFs are sometimes accepted manuscripts, not finals with editing and formatting

Sci-Hub thyically will not have the PDF on the day it is first published

Frequently Sci-Hub does not respond at all (too many visitors, publisher fights)

About 50% of the time Sci-Hub will have previously obtained the PDF

Sometimes Sci-Hub will obtain the PDF while you wait - about 2 minutes

[Sci-Hub article on Verge - Feb 2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit)

* "Elsevier, for example, boasts a nearly $35 billion market cap. It has reported a nearly 39 percent profit margin for its scientific publishing arm"

* Open Access now (not Sci-Hub) now accounts for  28 % Digital Object Identifiers

* "...many Open Access publishers charge scientists fees — often anywhere from a few hundred dollars up to around two thousand — for processing their articles, whether they’re accepted or not."

* 70 % of peer-review Open Access models do not charge anything

* Researchgate was pressured into taking down 7 million unauthorized copies of their (publishers) papers.

* Sci-Hub has “gained access” to “around 400 universities.”

* "Now, once users pointed Sci-Hub toward an article, the site would check every university proxy server until it found one through which it could download the paper, and would download it automatically."

* " “Access from China and Iran was blocked for some time because Sci-Hub couldn’t serve as many requests as were coming from these countries".

* ".She also made Sci-Hub inaccessible to Americans ( **except those using VPNs** ) — in part because of the number of download requests, but also because she wanted to avoid becoming a target for lawsuits.__

#### [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)

Excellent

Have used for decades, it provides news updates via RSS and email

I often limit a search to having "vitamin D" in the **title**  so as to not get too many returns

 **<span style="color:#F00;">28,000,000 studies</span>**  as of April 2018

Very powerful filters – such as author, word must be in title, human, 

Very good synomyn expansion of your queries.

#### [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)

HUGE - all kinds of studies - not just medical

I have used it for years, it has RSS notifications of updates
