#### Interaction of Vitamin D Supplements and Marine n-3 Fatty Acids on Digestive Tract Cancer Prognosis

A meta-analysis suggested that marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), e.g., eicos- apentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), might reduce cancer mortality. However, a randomized clinical trial of marine n-3 PUFA and vitamin D supplementation failed to verify this benefit. This study aimed to investigate the potential interaction between vitamin D supplementation and serum EPA and DHA levels. This post hoc analysis of the AMATERASU trial (UMIN000001977), a randomized controlled trial (RCT), included 302 patients with digestive tract cancers divided into two subgroups stratified by median serum levels of EPA + DHA into higher and lower halves. The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was significantly higher in the higher half (80.9%) than the lower half (67.8%; hazard ratio (HR), 2.15; 95% CI, 1.29-3.59). In the patients in the lower EPA + DHA group, the 5-year RFS was significantly higher in the vitamin D (74.9%) than the placebo group (49.9%; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.78). Conversely, vitamin D had no effect in the higher half, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation only had a significant interactive effect on RFS in the lower half (p for interaction = 0.03). These results suggest that vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of relapse or death by interacting with marine n-3 PUFAs.

##### I do not recall ever seeing Omega-3 levels rise due to Vitamin D

---

##### Perhaps vitamin D calmed the digestive system enough that more Omega-3 in food got into the body

---

##### Speculate: Similar reduction in Digestive Cancer problems after surgery if supplement Omega-3 in addition to Vitamin D
