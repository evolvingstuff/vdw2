#### From monkeypox to polio, here’s why so many viruses are attacking the UK

 **[Telegaph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/monkeypox-polio-why-many-viruses-attacking-uk/?WT.mc_id=e_DM5849&WT.tsrc=email&etype=Edi_GHS_New_Tue&utmsource=email&utm_medium=Edi_GHS_New_Tue20220628&utm_campaign=DM5849)** 

* “Many of the factors driving the spread of new and existing viruses are not new.” 

   * “Population growth, the booming economies of previously undeveloped nations, human encroachment into jungles and forest and the growth in the trade in wildlife have all played a part. “

* “Climate change is also shifting the geography of disease. A paper earlier this year warned there could be a “potentially devastating” surge in the number of novel pathogens jumping between mammals over the next 50 years. It predicted “a minimum of at least 15,000” new spillover events by 2070, if temperatures rise by 2C. “

* “People going from this country to other countries and back is probably the biggest driver of disease importations,”
