#### Blunted serum 25(OH)D response to vitamin D 3 supplementation in children with autism

INTRODUCTION: Data suggest a potential role for vitamin D in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevention and treatment. It is likely that the serum response to vitamin D supplementation contributes to its effectiveness. Multiple factors affect serum vitamin D 25(OH)D response to supplementation.

METHODS: We conducted post-hoc analysis of two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of vitamin D3 supplementation, one RCT involving children with ASD and another involving children with asthma. Both trials were conducted in the same geographic location (Dublin, Ireland, 53°N), conducted over Winter season and utilized the same vitamin D3 dose (2000 IU/day).

RESULTS: We included 18 children with ASD and 17 children with asthma. There was no significant difference in 25(OH)D or age at baseline, however, BMI was significantly lower in ASD (P = 0.03). Compliance with vitamin D supplementation was high in both trials. Despite a significantly longer intervention period (20w vs. 15w; P < 0.0001), ASD children had a significantly lower absolute increase (+26 vs. +45 nmol/l) in 25(OH)D (P = 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS:  Despite similar demographics, children with ASD had a lower increase in 25(OH)D levels with supplementation. Potential mechanisms include altered absorption/metabolism as well as well genetic factors. Clinical and research work relating to vitamin D is ASD should measure 25(OHO)D response to supplementation to assess therapeutic doses.

##### Study speculation by VitaminDWiki

 **2,000 IU daily to asthmatics (15 weeks) and autistics (20 weeks)** 

 **Possible reasons include** 

1. Autistics have a gene problem which results in decreased activation or increased destruction

1. Autistics have poor digestion, and thus less oil-based Vitamin D gets out of their guts 

> Suspect a similar response blunting to oil-based vitamin D in others having poor digestion

1. Autistics have more inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which may decrease 25(OH)

#### Autistics have 1/2 the response to Vitamin D - poor gut bacteria?

 **Autistics would probably benefit from 1 or more of the following** 

1) Larger  Vitamin D doses

2) [Topical](/tags/topical.html), [sublingual](/posts/sublingual-vitamin-d), UVB

4) [Higher concentrations achieved by non-daily dosing](/posts/better-than-daily)
