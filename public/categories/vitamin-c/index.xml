&lt;p>Hypovitaminosis C and D are highly prevalent in acute-care hospitals, but their clinical implications have not been investigated. Because deficiencies of these vitamins can adversely affect mood, we conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial to determine the effect of vitamin C (500 mg twice daily) or D (5000 IU daily) supplementation on psychological status, as assessed using two different validated instruments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin C is important for the common cold and much else</title><link>/posts/vitamin-c-is-important-for-the-common-cold-and-much-else.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-c-is-important-for-the-common-cold-and-much-else.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A doctor got me interested in re-looking at vitamin C in Jan 2013&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Osteoporosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and influences quality of life, as well as life expectancy. Currently, there is a growing interest among the medical scientists in search of specific nutrients and/or bioactive compounds of natural origin for the prevention of disease and maintenance of bone health. Although calcium and vitamin D have been the primary focus of nutritional prevention of osteoporosis, a recent research has clarified the importance of several additional nutrients and food constituents.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Healthy bones need: Calcium, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Silicon, Vitamin K, and Boron – 2012</title><link>/posts/healthy-bones-need-calcium-vitamin-d-magnesium-silicon-vitamin-k-and-boron-2012.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/healthy-bones-need-calcium-vitamin-d-magnesium-silicon-vitamin-k-and-boron-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Essential Nutrients for Bone Health and a Review of their Availability in the Average North American Diet.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Osteoporosis and low bone mineral density affect millions of Americans. The majority of adults in North America have insufficient intake of vitamin D and calcium along with inadequate exercise. Physicians are aware that vitamin D, calcium and exercise are essential for maintenance of bone health. Physicians are less likely to be aware that dietary insufficiencies of magnesium, silicon, Vitamin K, and boron are also widely prevalent, and each of these essential nutrients is an important contributor to bone health. In addition, specific nutritional factors may improve calcium metabolism and bone formation. It is the authors&amp;rsquo; opinion that nutritional supplements should attempt to provide ample, but not excessive, amounts of factors that are frequently insufficient in the typical American diet.In contrast to dietary insufficiencies, several nutrients that support bone health are readily available in the average American diet. These include zinc, manganese, and copper which may have adverse effects at higher levels of intake. Some multivitamins and bone support products provide additional quantities of nutrients that may be unnecessary or potentially harmful.The purpose of this paper is to identify specific nutritional components of bone health, the effects on bone, the level of availability in the average American diet, and the implications of supplementation for each nutritional component. A summary of recommended dietary supplementation is included.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fish need vitamin D and C for their bones</title><link>/posts/fish-need-vitamin-d-and-c-for-their-bones.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/fish-need-vitamin-d-and-c-for-their-bones.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="overview-of-vitamin-d-and-c-requirements-in-fish-and-their-influence-on-the-skeletal-system">Overview of vitamin D and C requirements in fish and their influence on the skeletal system&lt;/h4>
