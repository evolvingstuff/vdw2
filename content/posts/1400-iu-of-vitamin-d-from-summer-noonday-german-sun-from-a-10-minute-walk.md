 **| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spring | head + hands  | 7% of skin | 1400 IU |
| Summer  | head + hands + arms | 20% of skin | 250 IU |** 

### Note:

1. Assumes White skin

> Dark skin can be 2X to 5X less responsive

1. Assumes not obese 

> more than half of Vitamin D goes to fat cells, not to the body

1. Assumes young 

> only about 1/3 as much vitamin D is generated by elderly skin

1. Assumes same amount generated by each skin area 

> see [Little Vitamin D generated by face and hands - June 2015](/posts/little-vitamin-d-generated-by-face-and-hands)

1. Assumes an unspecified amount of head hair

1. Assumes same skin response regardless of the time of year 

> seems unlikely

1. Vitamin D winter does not appear to exist
