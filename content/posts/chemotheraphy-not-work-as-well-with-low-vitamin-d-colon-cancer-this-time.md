Background

Hypovitaminosis D is associated with an adverse prognosis in colon cancer patients, possibly due to the effects of the vitamin on the immune system. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) significantly contributes to the anti-tumor effects of monoclonal antibodies, including cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted monoclonal antibody that is frequently added to chemotherapy in the treatment of colon cancer.

Objective: The present study evaluates the association between vitamin D serum levels and the ability of ex vivo NK cells to support cetuximab-mediated ADCC in colon cancer cell lines.

Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 124 healthy volunteers and serum vitamin D was determined by RIA. NK cells were isolated from each sample and added to human colorectal carcinoma cells with or without cetuximab, and ADCC was assessed using a colorimetric lactate dehydrogenase assay.

Results

Correlation analysis indicates a significant, gender- and age-independent association between vitamin D levels and cetuximab-induced ADCC on HT29 cells, where NK cells from samples with vitamin D < 20 ng/mL are significantly less efficient in inducing ADCC. A confirmatory study on two additional colon cancer cell lines yielded similar results.

Conclusions: These data suggest that vitamin D supplementation in vitamin-deficient/insufficient colorectal cancer patients could improve cetuximab-induced ADCC.
