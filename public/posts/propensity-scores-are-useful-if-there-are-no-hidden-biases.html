Tena a b c, Claudio Detotto c d</p><p>When treatment cannot be manipulated, propensity score analysis provides a useful way to making causal claims under the assumption of no unobserved confounders. However, it is still rarely utilised in leadership and applied psychology research. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it explains and discusses the application and key assumptions of the method with a particular focus on propensity score weighting. This approach is readily implementable since a weighted regression is available in most statistical software. Moreover, the approach can offer a “double robust” protection against misspecification of either the propensity score or the outcome model by including confounding variables in both models. A second aim is to discuss how propensity score analysis (and propensity score weighting, specifically) has been conducted in recent management studies and examine future challenges. Finally, we present an advanced application of the approach to illustrate how it can be employed to estimate the causal impact of leadership succession on performance using data from Italian football. The case also exemplifies how to extend the standard single treatment analysis to estimate the separate impact of different managerial characteristic changes between the old and the new manager.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;20&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/causal-inference-psa-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=propensity-score-weighting-for-causal-inference-with-multiple-treatments---dec-2019>Propensity score weighting for causal inference with multiple treatments - Dec 2019</h4><p>Ann. Appl. Stat. 13(4): 2389-2415 (December 2019). DOI: 10.1214/19-AOAS1282</p><p>Fan Li, Fan Li</p><p>Causal or unconfounded descriptive comparisons between multiple groups are common in observational studies. Motivated from a racial disparity study in health services research, we propose a unified propensity score weighting framework, the balancing weights, for estimating causal effects with multiple treatments. These weights incorporate the generalized propensity scores to balance the weighted covariate distribution of each treatment group, all weighted toward a common prespecified target population. The class of balancing weights include several existing approaches such as the inverse probability weights and trimming weights as special cases. Within this framework, we propose a set of target estimands based on linear contrasts. We further develop the generalized overlap weights, constructed as the product of the inverse probability weights and the harmonic mean of the generalized propensity scores. The generalized overlap weighting scheme corresponds to the target population with the most overlap in covariates across the multiple treatments. These weights are bounded and thus bypass the problem of extreme propensities. We show that the generalized overlap weights minimize the total asymptotic variance of the moment weighting estimators for the pairwise contrasts within the class of balancing weights. We consider two balance check criteria and propose a new sandwich variance estimator for estimating the causal effects with generalized overlap weights. We apply these methods to study the racial disparities in medical expenditure between several racial groups using the 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. Simulations were carried out to compare with existing methods.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;20&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/ps-weighting.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p><hr><h4 id=propensity-score-matching-the-devil-is-in-the-details-where-more-may-be-hidden-than-you-know>Propensity Score Matching: The ‘Devil is in the Details’ Where More May Be Hidden than You Know</h4><p>The American Journal of MedicinevVolume 133, Issue 2, Feb 2020, Pages 178-181 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.08.055>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.08.055</a></p><p>James A. Reiffel MD</p><p>Propensity score matching has been used with increasing frequency in the analyses of non-prespecified subgroups of randomized clinical trials, and in retrospective analyses of clinical trial data sets, registries, observational studies, electronic medical record analyses, and more. The method attempts to adjust post hoc for recognized unbalanced factors at baseline such that the data once analyzed will hopefully approximate or indicate what a prospective randomized data set—the “gold standard” for comparing two or more therapies—would have shown. However, for practical limitations, propensity score matching cannot assess and balance all the factors that come into play in the clinical management of patients and that may be present in the circumstances of the study. Thus, propensity score matching analyses may omit, due to nonrecognition, the effects of several clinically important but not considered factors that can affect the outcomes of the analyses being reported, causing them to possibly be misleading, or hypothesis-generating at best. This review discusses this issue, using several specific examples, and is targeted at clinicians to make them aware of the limitations of such analyses when they apply their results to patients in their care.</p><p>{FONT(size=&ldquo;20&rdquo;)}** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/psa-sci-hub.pdf>Download the PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki </a>**{FONT}</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/bone.html><span class=tag>bone</span></a>
