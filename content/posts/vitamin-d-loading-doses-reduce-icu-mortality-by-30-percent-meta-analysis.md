Purpose

Low vitamin D blood levels are associated with high mortality in critically ill patients. There is controversy about vitamin D supplementation in this population. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate if vitamin D administration reduces mortality in critically ill patients.

Materials and methods

Online databases were searched up to September 1st, 2016 for randomized placebo-controlled trials on the use of vitamin D in adult patients with critical illness. The primary end point was mortality among trials with low risk of bias. The secondary end points were length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, length of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events.

Results

Seven studies published between 2011 and 2016, for a total of 716 patients, were included in the analysis. Vitamin D administration was associated with significantly lower mortality compared with placebo (101/320 <span>[32%]</span> in the vitamin D group vs 123/307 <span>[40%]</span> in the placebo group; odds ratio, 0.70 <span>[95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.98]</span>; P = .04; I2 = 0%). No differences in adverse events and other secondary end points were found.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients, vitamin D administration might be associated with a reduction in mortality without significant adverse events. A large multicenter randomized trial should conclusively confirm these findings.

Introduction

Vitamin D insufficiency is reported in up to 50% of the critically ill patients and is associated with increased mortality, length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, and respiratory disorders with prolonged ventilation. Benefits of vitamin D supplementation remain unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical benefits of vitamin D administration in critically ill patients.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane database for randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted on heterogeneous ICU patients comparing vitamin D administration to placebo. Evaluated outcomes included mortality, infectious complications, hospital/ICU LOS and length of mechanical ventilation. Two independent reviewers assessed eligibility, risk of bias and abstracted data. Data was pooled using a random effect model to estimate the relative risk (RR) or weighted mean difference. Pre-defined subgroup analysis included oral-enteral vs. parenteral administration, high vs. low dose, vitamin d deficient patient, high vs. low quality trials.

Results

Six RCTs (695 patients) met study inclusion. No reduction in mortality was found (P = 0.14). No differences in ICU and hospital LOS, infection rate and ventilation days existed. In the subgroup analysis, the oral-enteral group, there was no improvement in mortality (P = 0.12) or hospital LOS (P = 0.16). Daily doses >300,000 IU did not improve mortality (P = 0.12) and ICU LOS (P = 0.12).

Conclusions

In critically ill patients, Vitamin D administration does not improve clinical outcomes. The statistical imprecision could be explained by the sparse number of trials.
