#### Differences in outcomes between cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol supplementation in veterans with inflammatory bowel disease.

Aim: Vitamin D deficiency is a global health issue associated with increased health-care costs, and could play a role in the pathogenesis and management of inflammatory bowel disease. Prior studies show a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in veterans with inflammatory bowel disease. We aimed to examine the outcome differences in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, comparing treatment with ergocalciferol to cholecalciferol. 

Methods: A retrospective review of electronic medical records of patients with inflammatory bowel disease at a Veterans Affairs Medical Facility in the Southeastern United States was carried out. Those with at least one serum 25(OH) vitamin D level were included. Initial and follow-up vitamin D values were recorded. The type of vitamin?D supplementation, whether cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol, was documented. Costs in the year after measurement of vitamin D were divided into separate inpatient and outpatient categories. 

Results: Veterans (n=108) with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease and an available 25(OH) vitamin D level were studied. 

There were differences in follow-up vitamin D levels; those who received weekly ergocalciferol had higher subsequent levels than those who received cholecalciferol, especially at a second follow up, although differences did not achieve statistical significance. 

However, those who received vitamin D3 were less likely to use laboratory, pharmacy, radiology and fee-based services, and had lower laboratory and pharmacy costs. 

Conclusions: Our data suggest that cholecalciferol replacement might improve outcomes to a greater extent than ergocalciferol, and might be better in limiting health-care costs and expenses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
