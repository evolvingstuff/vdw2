32 Workers in a Hosptial in India were injected with Mycobacterium w (killed by heat)

64 Workers in that Hospitcal were the control group (not injected)

Only 1 injected worker tested positive for COVID-19 in the next 100 days

&nbsp; &nbsp;vs 30 who were not injected tested positive

The single injected worker who became injected had a mild case,

&nbsp; &nbsp;which did not require hospitalization

&nbsp; &nbsp; which was 4X shorter in duration than those who did not immune system boost
