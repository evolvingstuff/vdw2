### Nearly half of adults with hypertension are unaware they have it, WHO says - Sept 2023

 **[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/09/19/hypertension-world-health-organization/)** 

* "A [2020 study published in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30752-2/fulltext) found high blood pressure is “the single most important risk factor for early death,” the WHO report says. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, leads to an estimated 10 million deaths every year, but almost half of adults with high blood pressure don’t know they have it."

### Hypertension reduced by Vitamin D - umbrella of 21 meta-analyses - Aug 2023

 **The Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on Improving Blood Pressure: Evidence Obtained From an Umbrella Meta-Analysis** 

Clin Ther . 2023 Aug 21;S0149-2918(23)00294-1. [doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.07.020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.07.020) PDF behind paywall

Purpose: The results of meta-analyses regarding the effect of vitamin D on blood pressure are conflicting. The present umbrella meta-analysis was conducted to provide definite and conclusive results.

Methods: Systematically, Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature published up to July 2022. All meta-analyses of clinical trials addressing the effect of vitamin D on blood pressure were included. Random effects analysis was performed to obtain the overall effect size based on the standardized mean differences (SMDs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) separately. The quality of included meta-analyses was assessed by using the Measurement Tool for Assessing Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 questionnaire.

Findings: Overall, 21 meta-analyses were enrolled in the umbrella review. The results indicated that systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced after the intervention based on WMD effect size analysis (ESWMD = -0.69 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.35 to -0.04 <span>[P < 0.038]</span>; I2 = 46.7%, P = 0.021); however, no considerable impact was observed based on analysis of SMD effect sizes (ESSMD = -0.05 mm Hg; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.14; P = 0.615). 

Also, vitamin D supplementation indicated a significant improvement in diastolic blood pressure based on WMD effect sizes (ESWMD = -0.66 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.27 <span>[P < 0.001]</span>; I2 = 56.4%, P = 0.004) but not SMD analysis (ESSMD = -0.04 mm Hg; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.04 <span>[P = 0.328]</span>; I2 = 53.4%, P = 0.057).

Implications: Based on obtained evidence, vitamin D could be considered an efficient adjuvant for improving blood pressure.

### Latest Knowledge on the Role of Vitamin D in Hypertension - Feb 2023

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24(5), 4679; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24054679

by Niklas S. Jensen 1,Markus Wehland 2,3ORCID,Petra M. Wise 4 andDaniela Grimm 1,2,3,*ORCID

Hypertension is the third leading cause of the global disease burden, and while populations live longer, adopt more sedentary lifestyles, and become less economically concerned, the prevalence of hypertension is expected to increase. Pathologically elevated blood pressure (BP) is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related disability, thus making it imperative to treat this disease. Effective standard pharmacological treatments, i.e., diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (BARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), are available. Vitamin D (vitD) is known best for its role in bone and mineral homeostasis. Studies with vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout mice show an increased renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and increased hypertension, suggesting a key role for vitD as a potential antihypertensive agent. Similar studies in humans displayed ambiguous and mixed results. No direct antihypertensive effect was shown, nor a significant impact on the human RAAS.

Interestingly, human studies supplementing vitD with other antihypertensive agents reported more promising results. VitD is considered a safe supplement, proposing its great potential as antihypertensive supplement. The aim of this review is to examine the current knowledge about vitD and its role in the treatment of hypertension.

### 12 RCTs found that Vitamin D does reduce HT if vitamin D deficient - June 2022

 **Is Vitamin D Supplementation an Effective Treatment for Hypertension?** 

Hypertens Rep 24, 445–453 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-022-01204-6

Songcang Chen, Gio Gemelga & Yerem Yeghiazarians 

Purpose of the Review

Results from epidemiological studies suggest that vitamin D (VD) deficiency (VDD) may be a cause of hypertension (HTN). However, the results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to address the impact of VD supplementation on reducing blood pressure (BP) remain equivocal. To determine whether VD might serve as a beneficial treatment option for a specific subset of hypertensive patients, we performed a stratified analysis of RCT data and addressed problems associated with some methodological issues.

Recent Findings

HTN is caused by multiple factors. VDD may be one of the factors contributing to the development of this disorder. There are more than 70 RCTs that examined the impact of VD supplementation on BP. These RCTs can be classified into four groups based on their respective study populations, including participants who are (1) VD-sufficient and normotensive, (2) VD-deficient and normotensive, (3) VD-sufficient and hypertensive, and (4) VD-deficient and hypertensive.

Summary

Our evaluation of these studies demonstrates that VD supplementation is ineffective when used to reduce BP in VD-sufficient normotensive subjects. VD supplementation for five years or more may reduce the risk of developing HTN specifically among those with VDD. 

Interestingly, findings from  **12 RCTs indicate that daily or weekly supplementation, as opposed to large bolus dosing, results in the reduction of BP in VD-deficient hypertensive patients** . Our ongoing research focused on elucidating the mechanisms of VDD-induced HTN will ultimately provide evidence to support the development of etiology-specific prevention and treatment strategies focused on HTN in the VD-deficient population.

Background: Previous studies have already shown a link between vitamin D deficiency and hypertension. The impact of vitamin D deficiency in resistant hypertension is currently unknown. This study examined whether an association between the two entities exists.

Method: We analysed 2953 known hypertensive subjects surveyed by NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) among the United States population between 2003 and 2006. Subjects were categorized as having either resistant hypertension or hypertension based on the number of anti-hypertensives in use and their overall blood pressure control. Subjects were also categorized as vitamin D deficient if they had 25(OH)D (25-hydroxycholecalciferol) levels less than 20ng/ml.

Results: Out of the 2953 subjects, 362 (12%) were found to have resistant hypertension and 2591 (88%) had controlled hypertension. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in resistant hypertension and controlled hypertension groups was 61% and 46% respectively. Following adjustments for other variables such as age, renal function, obesity and ethnicity, the odds ratio (OR) for concomitant presence of resistant hypertension and vitamin D deficiency was  **3.49**  (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> 1.69–7.17; P < 0.009). The OR for having resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease, older age and obesity were 2.5 (95% CI 1.5–4; P < 0.0003), 1.034 (95% CI 1.02–1.07; P < 0.0001) and 1.048 (95% CI 1.02–1.07; P < 0.0001) respectively.

Conclusion: This study found a statistically significant association between vitamin D deficiency and resistant hypertension.

 **Role of vitamin d supplementation in hypertension.** 

by: R. K. Goel, Harbans Lal

Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB, Vol. 26, No. 1. (29 January 2011), pp. 88-90. doi:10.1007/s12291-010-0092-0 Key: citeulike:8626469

Role of Vitamin D supplementation was studied in patients with hypertension. 

One hundred hypertensive patients (group I) were given conventional antihypertensive drugs while another 100 patients (group II), in addition, were supplemented with Vitamin D(3) (33,000 IU, after every 2 weeks, for 3 months). 

Besides diastolic and systolic blood pressure, serum calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, albumin-corrected calcium, and 24 h urinary creatinine levels were estimated in both the groups before the start of treatment and after 3 months. 

Vitamin D supplementation showed a more significant decrease in systolic blood pressure. 

This group also showed a significant increase in serum calcium as well as albumin-corrected calcium with a decrease in phosphorous. 

Results of the study confirm that Vitamin D supplementation has a role in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients and that it should be supplemented with the antihypertensive drugs. More extensive studies with a larger group, to draw a definite conclusion, are in progress.

 **Prehypertension quickly becomes hypertension in blacks - Feb 2012** 

[Prehypertension](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/59/4/e27.extract) Feb 2012

 **Letter to the Editor: Prehypertension: To Treat or Not To Treat Should No Longer Be the Question** 

We read with great interest the article by Selassie et al1 that progression from prehypertension to full-blown hypertension occurs more  **rapidly in blacks, with 50% transitioning to hypertension within 1.7 years**  compared with  **2.7 years in whites** . Although the authors highlight the importance of controlling prehypertension, we feel that the authors missed an opportunity to stress the feasibility of using antihypertensive drugs to control prehypertension. As we argued previously,2 the recommendation by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure to treat prehypertension only with lifestyle changes3 is unlikely to work. Our view that prehypertension should be treated pharmacologically is supported by a recent meta-analysis of 16 trials involving 70664 patients.4 This analysis found that prehypertensive patients randomized to the active treatment arm had a 22% reduction in the risk of stroke as compared with the placebo group. In addition, treatment of prehypertension with an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced the risk of incident hypertension.5 Thus, the debate of whether to treat prehypertension should end. Treating prehypertension is medically sound and economically viable,2 and benefits of treatment are now apparent.

### Blood pressures not dropping at night associated with very low level of vitamin D – May 2012

Relationship between Vitamin D Deficiency and Nondipper Hypertension

Clinical and Experimental Hypertension May 17, 2012. (doi:10.3109/10641963.2012.689045)

Mehmet Demir drmehmetmd@gmail.co, Tufan Günay, Gökhan Özmen, Mehmet Melek

Nondipper hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension. Vitamin D deficiency activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which affects the cardiovascular system. For this reason, a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and nondipper hypertension could be suggested. In this study, we compared 25-OH vitamin D levels between dipper and nondipper hypertensive patients. The study included 80 hypertensive patients and they were divided into two groups: 50 dipper patients (29 male, mean age 51.5 ± 8 years) and 30 nondipper patients (17 male, mean age 50.6 ± 5.4 years). All the patients were subjected to transthoracic echocardiography and ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. In addition to routine tests, 25-OH vitamin D and parathormone (PTH) levels were analyzed. All the patients received antihypertensive drug therapy for at least 3 months prior to the evaluations. 25-OH vitamin D and PTH levels were compared between the two groups. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of basic characteristics. 

* The average PTH level of hypertensive dipper patients was lower than that of nondipper patients (65.3 ± 14.2 vs. 96.9 ± 30.8 pg/mL, P < .001). 

* The average 25-OH vitamin D level of hypertensive dipper patients was higher than that of nondipper patients (21.9 ± 7.4 vs. 12.8 ± 5.9 ng/mL, P = .001). 

* The left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index were lower in the dipper patients than in the nondipper patients (186.5 ± 62.1 vs. 246.3 ± 85.3 g, P = .022; and 111.6 ± 21.2 vs.147 ± 25.7 g/m2, P < .001, respectively). 

Other conventional echocardiographic parameters were similar between the two groups. Daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were similar between dippers and nondippers, but there was a significant difference between the two groups with regard to nighttime measurements (nighttime systolic 118.5 ± 5.8 vs.130.2 ± 9.6 mm Hg, P < .001; and nighttime diastolic 69.3 ± 4.8 vs.78.1 ± 7.2 mm Hg, P < .001, respectively). 

Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency has a positive correlation with blood pressure and vitamin D deficiency could be related to nondipper hypertension. The measurement of vitamin D may be used to indicate increased risk of hypertension-related adverse cardiovascular events.

 **Wikipedia  on Hypertension dipping at night - May 2012** 

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring allows blood pressure to be intermittently monitored during sleep, and is useful to determine whether the patient is a dipper or non-dipper- - that is to say whether or not blood pressure falls at night compared to daytime values. A nighttime fall is normal. It correlates with relationship depth but other factors such as sleep quality, age, hypertensive status, marital status, and social network support.<sup>[2]</sup> Absence of a night time dip is associated with poorer health outcomes, including increased mortality in one recent study.<sup>[3]</sup>  **In addition, nocturnal hypertension is associated with end organ damage<sup>[4]</sup> and is a much better indicator than the daytime blood pressure reading.**

VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION DURING WINTER MONTHS REDUCES CENTRAL BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION

22nd European Meeting on Hypertension and Cardiovascular Protection. April 2012, Oral 7A.02

Objective: In the northern hemisphere vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent during winter months, and observational studies have associated hypertension with poor vitamin D status. We tested the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation in the winter lowers blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension.

Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.

Method: 130 patients with hypertension were randomized to a daily oral dose of 75 ug cholecalciferol or placebo for 20 weeks. The study population consisted of Caucasians residing in Denmark at the 56th northern latitude. Baseline examinations took place from October to November where cutaneous vitamin D synthesis is absent. Primary endpoints were 24-h ambulatory BP, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central BP obtained by applanation tonometry. Other endpoints were p-25(OH)D, p-Ca++, p-iPTH and components of the renin-angiotensin system. Plasma concentrations of renin, angiotensin II and aldosterone were measured using RIAs. Data were analyzed using unpaired t-test and Mann-Whitney test when appropriate.

Results: 112 patients (mean age 61 ± 10) with a baseline p-25(OH)D of 57 ± 26 nmol/l completed the study. Compared with placebo, cholecalciferol caused a significant increase in p-25(OH)D (62 nmol/l, p < 0.001) and p-Ca++ (0.01 mmol/l, p < 0.05), and a significant suppression of p-PTH (0.97 pmol/l, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in 24-h ambulatory BP. 

However, in patients with p-25(OH)D <75 nmol/l (n = 92), the cholecalciferol group showed a borderline reduction in both systolic BP (3.7 mmHg, p = 0.08) and diastolic BP (2.7 mmHg, p = 0.02) compared to placebo. 

Furthermore, in all patients, central systolic and diastolic BP was reduced  **6.8 mmHg**  (p = 0.007) and 1.7 mmHg (p = 0.15), respectively, compared to placebo. No statistically significant difference between groups was observed in pulse wave velocity.

Conclusion: In hypertensive Caucasians residing at the 56th northern latitude, 75 ug of cholecalciferol daily during winter months caused a significant reduction in central systolic blood pressure. In a sub-analysis of patients with p-25(OH)D <75 nmol/l, a marginal reduction in both systolic and diastolic 24-h ambulatory BP was observed.

### Hypertension goals lowered   140/90 to  130/80 by two or 3 organizations  Fall 2017

[Under New Guidelines, Millions More Americans Will Need to Lower Blood Pressure](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/blood-pressure-treatment-guidelines.html) New York times Nov 2017

* "number of men under age 45 with a diagnosis of high blood pressure will triple"

* "Nearly half of all American adults, and nearly 80 percent of those aged 65 and older, will find that they qualify and will need to take steps to reduce their blood pressure. "

[Don’t Let New Blood Pressure Guidelines Raise Yours](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/opinion/blood-pressure-guidelines.html?_r=0) New York Times

8% of those getting < 140 had heart problems vs only 6% of those < 120  = 25% less

Also " . . participants were required to be at higher-than-average risk for cardiovascular events? That means the benefit for average patients would be even smaller."

Also - blood pressure measurements need to be taken 5 minutes after sitting down - if not it may be artificially high

Hypertension and vitamin D concentrations have heritable components, although these factors remain uninvestigated in young adults. The objective of this study was to investigate hypertension risk among young adults with respect to family history of hypertension, adjusting for vitamin D status. Resting blood pressure (BP) was measured in 398 individuals aged 18-35 and classified according to the 2017 American Heart Association criteria. Plasma vitamin D metabolite (25(OH)D3; 24,25(OH)2D3; 1,25(OH)2D3) concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Stepwise logistic regression was used to select covariates. Participants' mean age was 21, 30.3% had hypertension, and nearly all unaware of their hypertensive status (90.7%). Compared with no parental history, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for hypertension was elevated among participants with two parents having hypertension ( **AOR = 4.5** , 95% CI: 1.70-11.76), adjusting for sex, body mass index, physical activity, and plasma 25(OH)D3. 

Results for  **systolic hypertension**  (SH) were similar but more extreme (two parents AOR = 7.1, 95% CI: 2.82, 17.66), although dihydroxy metabolites (1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3) were significant. There was a strong, independent association with dual parental history and hypertension status, regardless of vitamin D status. Hypertension was prevalent in nearly one-third of the sample and underscores the need for targeted prevention for young adults.

#### Hypertension increases with latitude - JAMA 2003

 **Hypertension prevalence and blood pressure levels in 6 European countries, Canada, and the United States** 

JAMA. 2003 May 14;289(18):2363-9. [doi: 10.1001/jama.289.18.2363.](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.289.18.2363.)

Context: Geographic variations in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and associated risk factors have been recognized worldwide. However, little attention has been directed to potential differences in hypertension between Europe and North America.

Objective: To determine whether higher blood pressure (BP) levels and hypertension are more prevalent in Europe than in the United States and Canada.

Design, setting, and participants: Sample surveys that were national in scope and conducted in the 1990s were identified in Germany, Finland, Sweden, England, Spain, Italy, Canada, and the United States. Collaborating investigators provided tabular data in a consistent format by age and sex for persons at least 35 years of age. Population registries were the main basis for sampling. Survey sizes ranged from 1800 to 23 100, with response rates of 61% to 87.5%. The data were analyzed to provide age-specific and age-adjusted estimates of BP and hypertension prevalence by country and region (eg, European vs North American).

Main outcome measures: Blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in Europe, the United States, and Canada.

Results: Average BP was 136/83 mm Hg in the European countries and 127/77 mm Hg in Canada and the United States among men and women combined who were 35 to 74 years of age. This difference already existed among younger persons (35-39 years) in whom treatment was uncommon (ie, 124/78 mm Hg and 115/75 mm Hg, respectively), and the slope with age was steeper in the European countries. For all age groups, BP measurements were lowest in the United States and highest in Germany. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 28% in the North American countries and 44% in the European countries at the 140/90 mm Hg threshold. The findings for men and women by region were similar. Hypertension prevalence was strongly correlated with stroke mortality (r = 0.78) and more modestly with total CVD (r = 0.44).

Conclusions: Despite extensive research on geographic patterns of CVD, the 60% higher prevalence of hypertension in Europe compared with the United States and Canada has not been generally appreciated. The implication of this finding for national prevention strategies should be vigorously explored.
