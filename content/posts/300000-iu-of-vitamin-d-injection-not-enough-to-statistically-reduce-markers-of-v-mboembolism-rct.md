 **VitaminDWiki suspects that significant results would have resulted from any of:**  

* A single dose  of 500,000 IU

* two doses of 300,000 IU 

* Oral dosing of 500,000 over a space of 2 months

High plasma level of P-selectin is associated with the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Furthermore, supplementation of vitamin D could decrease thrombotic events. Hence, this study was designed to examine whether the administration of vitamin D can influence the plasma level of P-selectin in patients with VTE. In the randomized controlled trial, 60 patients with confirmed acute deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) were randomized into the intervention (n = 20) and control (n = 40) groups. 

The intervention arm was given an intramuscular single dose of 300 000 IU vitamin D3 Plasma level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, P-selectin, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured at baseline and 4 weeks after. The plasma level of P-selectin (95% confidence interval = -5.99 to -1.63, P = .022) and hs-CRP (P = .024) significantly declined in vitamin D-treated group, while only hs-CRP was significantly decreased in the control group (P = .011). However, the magnitude of these reductions was not statistically significant. This study could not support the potential benefit of the high-dose vitamin D on plasma level of P-selectin and hs-CRP in patients with VTE.
