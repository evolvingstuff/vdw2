**This is an attempt to see if Roundup/Glyphosate causes problems with Vitamin D - started May 2013** 

 **Hypothesis: Glyphosate ==> disrupt enzyme ==> one of the causes of vitamin D reduction** 

 **Reasons to think that the hypothesis is correct** 

1. Glyphosate ==> disrupt enzyme: conclusion of one study (would really like more . . )

1. In the past 40 years that Glyphosate has been increasing, vitamin D has been decreasing.

1. The close association between increased use of Glyphosate and increased diseases that are associated with low levels of vitamin D - such as Autism

 **Looking for data to support or refute the hypothesis** 

1) There are only a few countries with total bans on GMO foods for 10 years

Have those countries had fewer problems with low levels of vitamin D and associated diseases?

Note: I believe that many things reduce vitamin D besides Glyphosate

- examples include latitude, skin color, season, air pollution, being indoors, etc. http://is.gd/lowvitamind

So I do not expect to see a smoking gun, that is, lots more vitamin D in the countries which have banned GMO foods.

2) Cattle that have been fattened (last 3 months of their lives) on corn (with Glyphosate) seem to have very low levels of vitamin D in the meat

How much vitamin D is in the meat of organic cattle?

Suspect that it should be similar to what cattle had 80 years ago. (1000 IU per kg??)

How much vitamin D is in the cattle meat in the countries which ban GMO foods

This assumes that the GMO ban applies to animal feed as well as human food

 **It's often marketed as “safe” because humans don’t have the same enzyme pathways it targets in plants.   
However, our gut bacteria do have this pathway, so it can affect the gut microbiome."**
