* "In drawing an “allergy map” of Australia, allergy expert Dr Ray Mullins started with 36,000 children Australia-wide who had been prescribed “allergy-safe” infant formula (see reference 1 below). He also mapped the locations of 69,000 children prescribed emergency adrenaline to be used in case of a food allergy event (2). He added the locations of 11,000 cases, over five years, of children who were taken to hospital suffering an allergic reaction to food."

* "When it came to the difference between Cairns and Hobart, Dr Mullins said incidences could be six times higher in the southern city."
