   *  **No consensus: Increased Vitamin D ==> increased Kidney Stones  
Magnesium and Vitamin K2 will probably decrease Kidney Stones  
Increased Vitamin D + Decreased Calcium will probably decrease Kidney stones**

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a pandemic but remains without a well-defined treatment or prevention strategy. Research efforts have focused on the use of existing medications, such as azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and famotidine. The use of vitamin supplements, particularly vitamins C and D has also garnered great interest. Prior research on respiratory infections suggests that vitamin C and D supplementation may be beneficial <sup>[1]</sup>, <sup>[2]</sup>, <sup>[3]</sup>, <sup>[4]</sup>. However, crucially needed data from double-blind controlled studies are lacking.

Vitamin C is metabolized to oxalate and vitamin D regulates calcium homeostasis. Thus, these supplements are potentially lithogenic. Nephrolithiasis is a common urologic pathology and it is critical for practitioners to counsel stone-forming patients on the safety of vitamin C and D supplementation in the COVID-19 era, particularly given that universal facemask precautions may limit routine oral hydration. Here we highlight relevant literature regarding vitamins C and D and their relationship to respiratory infections and nephrolithiasis to guide practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1).
