*  **From PDF**  Cholecalciferol 20.000 IU daily from day 1 until day 3, then every second day for 4 weeks. In this study, we aimed for a target vitamin D level between 100 and 150 nmol/l. Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were measured weekly (before administration = week 0). In both groups, 380.000 IU 25-OH vitamin D were administered per patient over the course of the study
