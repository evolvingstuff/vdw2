### Mercola blog post headings and highlights

* How Metabolic Bone Disease in Infants Gets Confused with Child Abuse

> The risk of rickets in a twin pregnancy is 25 times higher than in a single pregnancy

> We know that collagen requires vitamin D as well.

* Pregnant Women: Beware of Taking TUMS!

> What has now been found is that calcium carbonate can actually wreak havoc on both vitamin D levels and your bone density.

> Calcium carbonate was used to  **cause rickets**  in rats in studies in 1920’– 1950’s

> Need the normal ratio: 2:1 calcium to phosphorus.

* Acid Reflux—An Overlooked Sign of Vitamin D Deficiency

> dyspepsia, bloating, constipation, and reflux symptoms are all quite common among those with vitamin D deficiency 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; because of reduced esophageal motility and sphincter dysfunction

* Vitamin D Is Critical During Pregnancy

* Most Infant Formulas Have an Adverse Effect on Baby's Bones

> 2006 study of infant forumula:  **palm olein**  has unintentional physiological consequences, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;including diminished intestinal absorption of fat, palmitic acid and calcium and lower bone mass.

* What About Babies with Bleeding in the Brain?

> Autopsy studies . . . show that about 20 percent . . . have bleeds in the head

* Widespread Systemic Changes Are Desperately Needed

### A critical review of the classic metaphyseal lesion: traumatic or metabolic?

AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2014 Jan;202(1):185-96. [doi: 10.2214/AJR.13.10540.](https://doi.org/10.2214/AJR.13.10540.)

OBJECTIVE:

The purpose of this study was to review the hypothesis that classic metaphyseal lesions represent traumatic changes in abused infants and compare these lesions with healing rickets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

Using a PubMed search, a multidisciplinary team reviewed studies that reported the histopathologic correlation of classic metaphyseal lesions. Selective studies of growth plate injury and rickets were cross-referenced.

RESULTS:

Nine identified classic metaphyseal lesion studies were performed by the same principal investigator. 

Control subjects were inadequate. 

Details of abuse determination and metabolic bone disease exclusion were lacking. 

The presence of only a single radiology reviewer prevented establishment of interobserver variability. 

Microscopy was performed by two researchers who were not pathologists. 

Classic metaphyseal lesions have not been experimentally reproduced and are unrecognized in the accidental trauma literature. 

The proposed primary spongiosa location is inconsistent with the variable radiographic appearances. 

Classic metaphyseal lesions were not differentiated from tissue processing artifacts. 

Bleeding and callus were uncommon in spite of the vascular nature of the metaphysis. 

The conclusion that excessive hypertrophic chondrocytes secondary to vascular disruption were indicative of fracture healing contradicts the paucity of bleeding, callus, and periosteal reaction. 

Several similarities exist between classic metaphyseal lesions and healing rickets, including 

* excessive hypertrophic chondrocytes. 

* "Bucket-handle" and "corner fracture" classic metaphyseal lesions 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; resemble healing rickets within the growth plate and the perichondrial ring, respectively.

The age of presentation was more typical of bone fragility disorders, including rickets, than reported in prior child abuse series.

CONCLUSION:

The hypothesis that classic metaphyseal lesions are secondary to child abuse is poorly supported. Their histologic and radiographic features are similar to healing infantile rickets. Until classic metaphyseal lesions are experimentally replicated and independently validated, their traumatic origin remains unsubstantiated.

New Zealand government reimbursed their costs and returned the child.

The first legal battle was not successful and the parents had an expert flown in from England to testify in the appeal - which they won.
