Introduction: Although the role of vitamin D in the prevention of rickets has long been well established, controversies still exist on the ideal dose of vitamin D supplementation in infants.

Objective: We assessed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) status simultaneously in maternal and cord samples and the response to vitamin D3 supplementation in neonates.

Methods: Serum 25OHD levels were evaluated from maternal, and umbilical cord samples from term normal pregnancies. Repeat 25OHD levels were assessed in neonates with 25OHD below 30 nmol/L following vitamin D3 200 IU daily after 6 weeks.

Results: Blood samples were taken including 57 cord samples and 16 follow-up neonatal samples. Maternal and cord serum 25OHD were 43 ± 21 and 29 ± 15 nmol/L, respectively. Infants with 25OHD < 30 nmol/L (19.8 ± 4.7 nmol/L) had a significant increase in serum 25OHD (63.3 ± 14.5 nmol/L) following vitamin D3 200 IU daily after 6 weeks.

Conclusion: Healthy Irish infants born at term are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency, but vitamin D3 200 IU daily, rapidly corrects poor vitamin D status.
