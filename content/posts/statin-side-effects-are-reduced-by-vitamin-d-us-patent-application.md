 **IF this application becomes a patent then Stain producers would have to pay a royality if they wanted to include Vitamin D in the same pill**

   * It has been known for a long time that Vitamin D relieves statin pain. 

   * Wonder why a patent could be applied for?

“A pharmaceutical composition and method reduces statin-related side effects, including myalgia, myositis, myopathy, and myonecrosis. The composition comprises at least one HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and vitamin D. The composition may comprise one or more excipient. The pharmaceutical composition is adapted to decrease side effects of said HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The excipient may comprise one or more excipient delivery agent providing immediate release, sustained release, extended release and/or combination thereof of said HMG-CoA and/or vitamin D. The amount of the vitamin D may be fixed or variable. A method of treating hyperlipidemia is provided comprising an orally administered pharmaceutical composition having at least one HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and vitamin D. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is administered once per day, via oral, nonoral, transdermal and/or injection drug delivery.”

<sup>[0012]</sup> While statins have proven effective in safely lowering LDL cholesterol, statin-related side effects have become a major concern. Specifically, side effects including myalgia, myositis, myopathy, and/or myonecrosis are relatively prevalent. Myalgia, myositis, myopathy and/or myonecroses pain directly related to taking statin drugs causes many patients to stop taking statins. The biological mechanism for statin-related myalgia is unknown. Some data indicates that vitamin D levels may play a role. A vitamin D deficiency itself is known to produce symptoms approximating statin-related myalgia. Some studies suggest that while some statin-treated patients had increased odds of myalgia, statin users with higher levels of vitamin D did not have an increased risk for myalgia when compared to non-statin users.
