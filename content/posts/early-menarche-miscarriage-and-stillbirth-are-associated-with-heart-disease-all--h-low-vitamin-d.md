Conclusion is the study in HEART http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312289 - which is available at Sci-Hub.tw

* Early menarche, early menopause, earlier age at first birth, and a history of miscarriage, stillbirth or hysterectomy were each independently associated with a higher risk of CVD in later life

* In conclusion, this large prospective study among 482000 women and men in the UK Biobank  demonstrated that several reproductive factors are associated with the risk of CVD in later life. Future studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to clarify the biological, behavioural and social mechanisms involved.
