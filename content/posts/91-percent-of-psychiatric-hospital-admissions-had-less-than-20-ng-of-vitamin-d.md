Aims and method Vitamin D deficiency is increasing in the general population, and is linked with physical and mental illness. However, evidence on its prevalence in people with mental illness is limited. This study investigated vitamin D deficiency in 104 adult patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the UK.

Results Forty-nine per cent were vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L), and a further 42.3% were vitamin D insufficient (<50 nmol/L). On admission, 8.7% of patients were vitamin D sufficient (>50 nmol/L). There were no statistically significant differences in mean serum vitamin D between different subgroups of mental illness.

Clinical implications Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among individuals with severe mental illness admitted to hospital. Assessment and treatment of vitamin D deficiency should be considered in in-patients to protect musculoskeletal health. Further epidemiological and intervention studies are needed to investigate the role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.
