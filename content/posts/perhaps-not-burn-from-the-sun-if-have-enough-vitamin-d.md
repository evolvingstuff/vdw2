My ability to tan and not burn has improved dramatically this year. I attribute it to supplementing with vitamin D, getting off statins, reducing n6 PUFA, adding fish oil and generally doing things that reduce inflammation (no grains, low carb, improving gut health).

My friend took high doses of vitamin D for a few weeks before rafting and, for the first time in his life, did not burn when rafting the Snake River. 

In fact a businessman is now selling a product at sun-tanning parlors to prevent burning; the product's active ingredient is simply  **30 tablets of 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3, to be taken daily for one month before tanning.**

Also, some fair-skinned people have a genetic variation that prevents their skin from making melanin pigment. Theoretically, vitamin D should not help them from sunburning. But don't confuse fact with theory. The fact is that some skin type 1 people cannot make much melanin; the theory is that vitamin D will not protect their skin from sunburn. However, I know of some very fair-skinned, blond-headed, blue eyed, skin type 1 people whose skin became less sensitive to the sun after taking 5,000 IU/day.
