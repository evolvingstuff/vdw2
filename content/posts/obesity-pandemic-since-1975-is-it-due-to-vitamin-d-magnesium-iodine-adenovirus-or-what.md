#### Relative Overweight and Obesity Change around the world (BMI >25)

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/obesity-rate-of-change.jpg" alt="image">

Probably not much fast-food in rural areas - which are putting on weight faster than urban areas

from Global nutrition transition and the pandemic of obesity in developing countries, Barry M Popkin, Linda S Adair, and Shu Wen Ng, 2011

#### What changes around the world have occurred since the mid 1970's which might have contributed to the obesity pandemic

#### Global deficiency now of items 1-3

1. Vitamin D -  perhaps a 4X decrease

> [12 recent reasons for vitamin D deficiency](/tags/12-recent-reasons-for-vitamin-d-deficiency.html) and 14 others

1. [Magnesium](/tags/magnesium.html) - perhaps a 2X decrease

> above link has 7 reasons for decreased Magnesium

1. Iodine - perhaps a 2X decrease

> Less iodine in milk and flour; less use of table salt; increased use of bromine and fluoride - both of which block iodine in the blood

1. Adenovirus-36  an increase - unknown how much and when

> symptoms of a several day cold or sore throat - but stays; [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenovirus_infection)

> (Contacted the Adenovirus/Obesity company Feb 2012: they do not have the data)

* Reduced [cholesterol?](/tags/cholesterol.html)

#### There do not appear to be GLOBAL changes in other factors often associated with obesity

Exercise, too many calories, wheat, reduced fiber, Calcium, Corn Syrup, fast food
