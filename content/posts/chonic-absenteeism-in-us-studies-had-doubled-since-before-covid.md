* "This is surprising and concerning, given that prior to the pandemic the rate of chronic absenteeism nationwide  **was 15%** ,   
but during the 2021-22 school year this  **doubled to 30%**  and it has not declined.  
 In fact, in some states the chronic absenteeism rate is 40%"

* "Chronic absenteeism is a metric defined as a student **absent for 15 days or more** , which comes out to around 10% of the school year.   
Chronic absenteeism has been used as a predictor of the student dropout rate.""
