#### Prescription of vitamin D was associated with a lower incidence of hip fractures

Patients with osteoporosis are prone to fragility fractures. Evidence of the effects of active forms of vitamin D on hip fracture prevention is insufficient. We examined the association between vitamin D prescription and incidence of new fractures using the data of osteoporotic patients from the nationwide health insurance claims database of Japan. The follow-up period was 3 years after entry. The untreated patients were never prescribed vitamin D during follow-up (n = 422,454), and the treated patients had a vitamin D medication possession ratio of â‰¥ 0.5 at all time points (n = 169,774). Propensity score matching was implemented on these groups, yielding 105,041 pairs, and subsequently, the control and treatment groups were established and analyzed. 

The incidence of new fractures was significantly lower in the treatment group compared with the control group (6.25% vs. 5.69%, hazard ratio 0.936 <span>[95% confidence interval 0.904-0.970]</span>, p < 0.001*). 

By site, hip fractures significantly decreased (0.89% vs. 0.42%, p < 0.001), but not vertebral and radial fractures. Subgroup analysis by vitamin D type showed a significantly lower incidence of total fractures only in alfacalcidol (hazard ratio 0.676 <span>[95% confidence interval 0.628-0.728]</span>, p < 0.001*). The results suggest that vitamin D prescription was associated with a reduced incidence of hip fractures.
