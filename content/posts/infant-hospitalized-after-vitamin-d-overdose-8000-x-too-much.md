### [Omaha, KETV](http://www.ketv.com/news/preview-accidental-overdose-puts-infant-in-hospital/37817504) Feb 2016

 **Transcript indicates that it took months to notice the 8,000X too high of dose** 

[1 dropperful instead of one drop](https://www.elitereaders.com/mom-inadvertently-causes-infant-overdose-vitamin-d/)

Somthing strange here.  A full dropper contains 15-20 drops

Assuming 400 IU/drop X 8,000 (which is perhaps a full bottle) = 4,300,000 IU daily

---

#### Is there even a single ingestable substance which is not deadly at 8000 X in a single day,  
&nbsp; &nbsp; much less 2 months?

Water (8,000 gallons), 

Aspirin (40 bottles), 

Calories (16 million calories), 

Vitamin C (8 kilograms)

etc.

## It is extremely hard to get a toxic amount of vitamin D
