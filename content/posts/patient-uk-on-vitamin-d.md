Vitamin D Deficiency</h1>

<div class="p2">

<table style="width: 98%; margin: 0pt auto;">

<tr>

<td>Vitamin D deficiency is a very common  problem - more than half of the UK population has insufficient levels of  vitamin D. Vitamin D is mostly made in the skin by exposure to  sunlight. Most foods contain very little vitamin D naturally, though  some are fortified (enriched) with added vitamin D. Vitamin D is  important for good health, growth and strong bones. Some people are more  at risk of deficiency, in particular pregnant women, breast-fed babies  and people with black or Asian skin types. Vitamin D supplements can be  used in these groups to prevent vitamin D deficiency.</td>

<div class="p2">

<h2>What is vitamin D?</h2>

<p>Vitamins are a group of  chemicals that are needed by the body for good health. Vitamin D is a  fat-soluble vitamin. The fact that it dissolves in fat is important,  because it means the body can store it for future use. Unlike other  vitamins, we do not need to get vitamin D from the food that we eat.  This is a good thing because most foods contain very little vitamin D  naturally. Foods that contain vitamin D include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Oily fish  (such as sardines, pilchards, herring, trout, tuna, salmon and  mackerel).</li>

<li>Liver.</li>

<li>Egg yolk.</li>

<li>Mushrooms.</li>

<li>Cheese,  milk and butter (small amounts).</li>

<li>Fortified foods (this means  they have vitamin D added to them) such as margarine, some cereals,  infant formula milk.</li>

</ul>

<b>Our main source of vitamin D is that  made by our own bodies. 90% of our vitamin D is made in the skin with  the help of sunlight</b>.<br />

<br />

UVB sunlight rays convert cholesterol  in the skin into vitamin D. Darker skins need more sun to get the same  amount of vitamin D as a fair-skinned person. The sunlight needed has to  fall directly on to bare skin (through a window is not enough). 2-3  exposures of sunlight per week in the summer months (April to September)  are enough to achieve healthy vitamin D levels that last through the  year. Each episode should be 20-30 minutes to bare arms and face. This  is not the same as suntanning; the skin simply needs to be exposed to  sunlight. The sun's rays can be damaging and sunburn should be avoided  at all costs (mainly because it can increase your risk of skin cancer).<br />

<br />

Chemical  processes occur in the liver, and then the kidney, to produce  calcitriol which is the active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol is a  chemical that helps calcium and phosphorus to be absorbed from the gut.  The calcium and phosphorus are essential for the structure and strength  of our bones.<br />

<br />

<b>So, vitamin D is really important for strong  bones. In addition, vitamin D seems to be important for muscles and  general health. Scientists have also found that vitamin D may help  prevent other diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease</b>.</div>

<div class="p2">

<h2>What is vitamin D deficiency?</h2>

<p>Vitamin D  deficiency means that there is not enough vitamin D in the body. Broadly  speaking this can occur in three situations:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>The  body has an increased need for vitamin D.</li>

<li>The body is unable to  make enough vitamin D.</li>

<li>Not enough vitamin D is being taken in  the diet.</li>

</ol>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>Who gets vitamin D deficiency?</h2>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Increased need for vitamin D</h3>

<p>Growing  children, pregnant women, and breast-feeding women need extra vitamin D  because it is required for growth. <br />

<br />

So, vitamin D deficiency is  more likely to develop in the following groups of people:</p>

<ul>

<li>Pregnant  or breast-feeding women. Vitamin D deficiency is even more likely to  develop in women who have had several full-term pregnancies with short  gaps between them. This is because the body's stores of vitamin D get  used up, and there is little time for them to be built up before another  pregnancy.</li>

<li>Breast-fed babies whose mothers are lacking in  vitamin D, or with prolonged breast-feeding, as there is little vitamin D  in breast milk. (<b>Note</b>: there are significant advantages to  breast-feeding; you should not stop breast-feeding due to concern about  vitamin D levels - your baby can simply have vitamin D supplements as  drops by mouth.)</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Situations where the body is unable to make enough  vitamin D</h3>

<p>People who get very little sunlight on their skin are  also at risk of vitamin D deficiency. This is more of a problem in the  most northern parts of the world where there is less sun. <br />

<br />

This  might occur in the following groups of people:</p>

<ul>

<li>People who  stay inside a lot - for example, those in hospital for a long time or  housebound people.</li>

<li>People who cover up a lot of their body when  outside - for example, wearing conservative Muslim veils such as the  niqab or burqa.</li>

<li>People with pigmented (coloured) skins. This  includes black and Asian people. Caucasian (white) people are less at  risk.</li>

<li>Strict sunscreen use can potentially lead to vitamin D  deficiency, particularly if high SPF creams (factor 15 or above) are  used. Nevertheless, children especially should <b>always</b> be  protected from the harmful effect of the sun's rays and should never be  allowed to burn or be exposed to the strongest midday sun.</li>

</ul>

<p>Elderly  people have thinner skin than younger people and so are unable to  produce as much vitamin D. This leaves older people more at risk of  vitamin D deficiency.<br />

<br />

Some medical conditions can affect the way  the body handles vitamin D. People with Crohn's disease, coeliac  disease, and some types of liver and kidney disease, are all at risk of  vitamin D deficiency.<br />

<br />

Vitamin D deficiency can also occur in  people taking certain medicines - examples include: carbamazepine,  phenytoin, primidone, barbiturates and some HIV medicines - highly  active antiretroviral treatment (HAART).</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Not enough dietary vitamin D</h3>

<p>Vitamin D  deficiency can occur in people who follow a strict vegetarian or vegan  diet, or other non-fish-eating diet.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>How common is vitamin D deficiency?</h2>

<p>It is  very common. A recent survey in the UK showed that more than half of the  adult population in the UK has insufficient levels of vitamin D. In the  winter and spring about 1 in 6 people have a severe deficiency. It is  estimated that about 9 in 10 adults of South Asian origin may be vitamin  D-deficient. Most affected people don't have any symptoms and are  unaware of the problem.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>What are the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?</h2>

<p>Many  people have no symptoms, or only vague ones such as tiredness or aches.  It is because symptoms of vitamin D deficiency are very nonspecific in  many people, hence the problem is often missed. The diagnosis is more  easily reached in severe deficiencies with some of the classical  (typical) bone deformities.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Symptoms in babies and children</h3>

<ul>

<li>Babies  with severe vitamin D deficiency can get muscle spasms (cramps),  seizures and breathing difficulties. These problems are related to  consequent low levels of calcium in the infant.</li>

<li>Children with  severe deficiency may have soft skull or leg bones. Their legs may look  curved (bow-legged). This condition is known as <b>rickets</b>. (See  separate leaflet called <i>'Rickets'</i> for more information).</li>

<li>Poor  growth. Height is usually affected more than weight. Affected children  might be reluctant to start walking.</li>

<li>Tooth delay. Children with  vitamin D deficiency may be late teething as the development of the milk  teeth has been affected.</li>

<li>Irritability in children can be due to  vitamin D deficiency.</li>

<li>Children with vitamin D deficiency are  more prone to infections and respiratory (breathing) symptoms can occur  In severe cases, breathing is affected because of weak chest muscles and  a soft ribcage.</li>

<li>Rarely an extremely low vitamin D level can  cause weakness of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). This can affect the  ability of the heart to pump blood efficiently around the body and is  known as heart failure. (<b>Note</b>: heart failure means the heart does  not pump well, it is different to cardiac arrest where the heart stops  beating completely).</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Symptoms in adults</h3>

<ul>

<li>Muscle pains or  muscle weakness are the common symptoms. In more severe deficiency, this  may cause difficulty standing up or climbing stairs, or can lead to the  person walking with a 'waddling' pattern. This is known as <b>osteomalacia</b>.  (See separate leaflet called <i>'osteomalacia'</i> for more  information).</li>

<li>Bone pains may develop and are typically felt in  the ribs, hips, pelvis, thighs and feet.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>How is vitamin D deficiency diagnosed?</h2>

<p>It may  be suspected from your medical history, symptoms, or lifestyle  (so-called risk factors). A simple blood test for vitamin D levels can  make the diagnosis. The blood test measures the level of a chemical  called 25 hydroxy-vitamin D (also called 25(OH)D). This is the chemical  formed in the liver during the process that converts sunlight into  vitamin D.<br />

<br />

A normal level of vitamin D is above 50 nmol/L. Levels  less than 25 nmol/L mean that you are deficient. A level in between  means you probably don't have enough vitamin D in the body.<br />

<br />

Blood  tests for calcium and phosphate levels and liver function may show  changes linked to a low level of vitamin D. Your blood count might be  checked as iron deficiency anaemia is often linked to rickets in  children. Sometimes, a wrist X-ray is done for a child. This can assess  how severe the problem is by looking for changes in the wrist bones.<br />

<br />

Extra  tests may be needed if the cause of the deficiency is in doubt, or if  there are other vitamin or mineral deficiencies. The doctors have to  remember that there are lots of causes of vitamin D deficiency, and that  underlying illnesses might be responsible.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>What is the treatment for vitamin D deficiency?</h2>

<p><b>Note</b>:  if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, see relevant section.<br />

<br />

The  treatment is to take vitamin D supplements. This is a form of vitamin D  called ergocalciferol or calciferol. (The dose of ergocalciferol is  written in units known as international units or IU. Some people use  micrograms or ?g instead, which are not the same as units.)<br />

<br />

Vitamin  D can be given as an injection or as a medicine (liquid or tablets).</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Injection</h3>

<p>A single small injection of vitamin  D will last for about six months. This is a very effective and  convenient treatment. It is useful for people who do not like taking  medicines by mouth, or who are likely to forget to take their tablets.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>High-dose tablets or liquids</h3>

<p>There are  different strengths available and a dose may be taken either daily,  weekly or monthly. This will depend on your situation and on which  particular treatment guideline your doctor is using. Always check with  your doctor that you understand the instructions - with high doses of  vitamin D it is important to take the medicine correctly. The advantage  of the higher-dose treatment is that the deficiency improves quickly -  important in growing children.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Standard dose tablets, powders or liquids</h3>

<p>These  need to be taken every day for about 12 months in order that the body  can 'catch up' on the missing vitamin D. This is a rather slow method of  replacing vitamin D, but is suitable if the deficiency is mild, or for  prevention. A disadvantage is that all these preparations contain either  calcium or other vitamins, giving them a strong taste which some people  dislike. Cod liver oil is an alternative.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>Doses of vitamin D required</h2>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Proven vitamin D deficiency</h3>

<p>Vitamin D  deficiency in adults is treated with 10 000 IU calciferol daily or 60  000 IU weekly for 8-12 weeks. Alternatively, 300 000 IU to 600 000 IU  can be given orally or by injection, once or twice. <br />

<br />

Treatment of  vitamin D deficiency in children depends on the child's age. Under six  months, 3000 IU calciferol per day is used for 8-12 weeks. In children  over six months, 6000 IU is used daily, for the same length of time. In  children over one year, 300 000 IU tends to be given as a single one-off  dose.<br />

&#160;</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Maintenance therapy after deficiency has been  treated</h3>

<p>After vitamin D deficiency has been treated, the body's  stores of vitamin D have been replenished. After this, <i>maintenance</i>  treatment is needed long-term, to prevent further deficiency in the  future (this is because it is unlikely that any risk factor for vitamin D  deficiency in the first place, will have completely resolved). Adults  need 1000-2000 IU calciferol daily or 10 000 IU weekly, for maintenance.  Children under six months need 200-400 IU per day and over six months  they need 400-800 IU per day.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>Adults need 400 IU per day. For  people who get little sunshine, and in the elderly, this should be  doubled to 800 IU. Higher preventative doses may be needed if you suffer  from other conditions, such as kidney or liver disease. Equally, if you  are taking some of the medicines that may affect the way the body  handles vitamin D, higher doses may be required. Cod liver oil is a  well-known supplement that contains good doses of vitamin D and so can  be used to prevent deficiencies. Cod liver oil should not be used by  pregnant women, due to the levels of vitamin A it contains.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Cautions when taking vitamin D supplements</h3>

<p>Care  is needed with vitamin D supplements in certain situations:</p>

<ul>

<li>If  you are taking certain other medicines: digoxin (for an irregular  heartbeat - atrial fibrillation) or thiazide diuretics such as  bendroflumethiazide (commonly used to treat high blood pressure). In  this situation, avoid high doses of vitamin D, and digoxin will need  monitoring more closely.</li>

<li>If you have other medical conditions:  kidney stones, some types of kidney disease, liver disease or hormone  disease. Specialist advice may be needed.</li>

<li>Vitamin D should <b>not</b>  be taken by people who have high calcium levels or certain types of  cancer.</li>

<li>You may need more than the usual dose if taking certain  medicines which interfere with vitamin D. These are: carbamazepine,  phenytoin, primidone, barbiturates and some medicines for the treatment  of HIV infection.</li>

</ul>

<p>Multivitamins are not suitable for  long-term high-dose treatment because the vitamin A they also contain  can be harmful in large amounts.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>If you are pregnant or breast-feeding</h2>

<p>Vitamin  D is especially important for pregnant or breast-feeding women, and  their babies, because it is needed for growth.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>Vitamin D supplements are  recommended for all pregnant women, breast-feeding women and breast-fed  babies.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Pregnant women and breast-feeding mothers</b>: 400  units (10 micrograms) daily of vitamin D are recommended. This can be  either as a calcium/vitamin D tablet, or as a multivitamin tablet  labelled as suitable for use in pregnancy. Some experts think that women  who get no sunshine need a higher preventative dose such as 800 units  (20 micrograms) daily. Pregnant women can get free prescriptions and  vitamins.</li>

<li><b>Babies</b>: all breast-fed babies should be given  vitamin drops (Abidec®, Dalivit® or Healthy Start Children's Vitamin  Drops in the dose advised on the label). Babies under one year need 200  IU of vitamin D per day. Over one year then need between 280 and 400 IU  per day. Free vitamins are available (for those that qualify) with the  Healthy Start scheme. Bottle-fed babies do not need vitamin D  supplements as formula milk is fortified with vitamin D. All weaned  babies who take cow's milk need vitamin D supplements as it contains  little natural vitamin D. Outside the UK, some countries do add vitamin D  to cow's milk, to fortify it.</li>

</ul>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Treatment of proven vitamin D deficiency in  pregnancy</h3>

<p>Doses of up to 1000 units (25 micrograms) daily of  vitamin D can be used. (In some situations, higher doses have been used  to treat pregnant women.) <br />

&#160;</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p3">

<h3>Cautions with vitamin supplementation in pregnancy</h3>

<p>If  you are pregnant or breast-feeding you should not use high doses of  vitamin D (the injections and high-dose tablets/liquids described  above). This is because of uncertainty about whether these doses are too  high for the baby. Doctors tend to be cautious about the dose of  vitamin D given to pregnant or breast-feeding women, and will often  limit the dose to 1000 units daily. This is a safe dose. It is likely  that higher doses are safe for pregnant women but further guidance is  awaited. <br />

<br />

If you are pregnant, you should not take supplements  containing large amounts of vitamin A (due to risk of harm to the unborn  baby). Supplements labelled as suitable for pregnancy are safe to use.  Similarly, pregnant women are advised not to eat liver due to the high  levels of vitamin A. Vitamin A is, however, safe if you are  breast-feeding.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p3 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>Are there any side-effects from vitamin D  supplements?</h2>

<p>It is very unusual to get side effects from vitamin D  if taken in the prescribed dose. However, very high doses can raise  calcium levels in the blood. This would cause symptoms such as thirst,  passing a lot of urine, nausea or vomiting, dizziness and headaches. If  you have these symptoms, you should see your GP promptly, so that your  calcium level can be checked with a blood test.<br />

<br />

Some guidelines  advise that people taking high vitamin D doses should have their calcium  levels checked during the first few weeks. In practice, this is not  usually done unless you have symptoms of high calcium as described  above.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>Prognosis (outlook) in vitamin D deficiency?</h2>

<p>The  outlook for vitamin D deficiency is usually excellent. Both the vitamin  levels and the symptoms generally respond well to treatment. However,  it can take time (months) for bones to recover and symptoms such as pain  to get better or improve.<br />

<br />

Mild or short-lived deficiency usually  causes few or no symptoms. Any symptoms that do occur improve and  generally disappear with treatment.<br />

<br />

The complications of severe  deficiency have already been mentioned. <b>Rickets</b> can occur in  children, and <b>osteomalacia</b> in adults. (See separate leaflets  called <i>Rickets'</i> and <i>'Osteomalacia'</i> for more information).  These diseases affect the strength and appearance of bones, and can lead  to permanent bone deformities if untreated or if treatment is very  delayed.<br />

<br />

Vitamin D is increasingly being linked to other diseases  and illnesses. In recent years there have been associations with  non-musculoskeletal (ie, non- bone or non-muscle) conditions such as  cancer, heart disease, infectious disorders, autoimmune disease and  diabetes. This does not mean that all people with vitamin D deficiency  will get these problems, neither does it mean that if you have one of  these illnesses, a vitamin D deficiency is the cause. In these cases  vitamin D is thought to be a factor. Since treatment is relatively  straightforward, it is a very worthwhile undertaking, because of the  numerous potential health benefits.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->

<div class="p2">

<h2>Follow-up</h2>

<p>Most people who are treated for  vitamin D deficiency will need to be reviewed a few weeks or months  after starting treatment - depending on how severe their symptoms are. A  further review after one year is advised.</p>

</div>

<!-- close p2 -->
