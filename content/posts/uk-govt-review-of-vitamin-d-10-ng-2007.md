1.           The main source of vitamin D in man is usually considered to be skin photosynthesis  following  irradiation  with  short  wavelength  ultra violet light (290-310 nm). Vitamin D is also found in a few foods, such as oily fish, fortified margarines and some breakfast cereals and there are smaller amounts in red meat and egg yolk.

2.          25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D and plasma levels of this metabolite serve as an indicator of vitamin D status. Traditionally a plasma 25(OH)D concentration less  than  25nmol/l   **(10ng/ml)**    has  been  regarded  an  index  of suboptimal vitamin D status. Recently higher thresholds have been proposed though the functional outcomes associated with them are currently  unclear.  Moreover,  laboratory  methodology  for  plasma 25(OH)D measurement is not well standardized.

3.          Several  factors  potentially  affect  vitamin  D  status.  These  include genetic  factors,  adiposity  and  factors  affecting  the  cutaneous synthesis  of  vitamin  D  such  as  skin  pigmentation,  age,  season, latitude,  melanin  concentration,  clothing  and  use  of  sunscreens. Seasonal variations in vitamin D status are observed in the UK where the  2000  National  Diet  and  Nutrition  Survey  (NDNS)  reported average  plasma  25(OH)D  concentrations  to  be  highest  in  July- September  and  lowest  in  January-March.  During  winter,  the  UK population relies on body stores and dietary vitamin D to maintain vitamin D status. Solar UV radiation varies with latitude, and in winter months at latitudes of about 52o  and above, there is no ultraviolet light of the appropriate wavelength for the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. For the remaining months, more than half the effective UV radiation occurs between certain times (1100 and 1500 hours) and is lower in the north than the south. Skin exposure to UV irradiation of the  appropriate  wavelength  is  essential  for  maintaining  adequate vitamin D status and a clear recommendation on length and intensity of exposure is required.

4.          The NDNS provides evidence of low vitamin D status, as defined by a  plasma  25(OH)D  concentration  less  than  25nmol/l,  in  most  age groups  in  the  UK  population,  especially  older  children  and  young adults, and in older people living in institutions. Young women of childbearing  age  also  have  low  vitamin  D  status  and  are  likely  to begin their pregnancies with low stores. Other evidence highlights a greater  risk  of  vitamin  D  deficiency  in  population  subgroups, particularly infants from black and ethnic minority groups. Cases of rickets and hypocalcaemia in UK children, predominantly of Afro- Caribbean or South Asian origin, are widely reported but there are no NDNS data for these population subgroups.

5.          The Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) as defined in the 1991 COMA report  do  not  set  a  Reference  Nutrient  Intake  for  vitamin  D  for adults  or  children  over  four  years  of  age  who  receive  adequate sunlight exposure. The current Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) for

pregnant and breastfeeding women is 10µg (400 IU)3   vitamin D per day. 

For children under the age of four years it is 7-8.5µg (280-340 IU) per  day  and  for  those  in  the  population  aged  

over  65  years  or confined indoors is 10µg vitamin D per day.

 **(recall that 10 ug = 400 IU)** 

Note: The above RNIs apply to healthy populations.  **Those at risk of inadequate sunlight exposure may require supplementation.** 

6.          In most instances, these intakes cannot be met from the diet and at the  present  time  can  only  be  guaranteed  by  supplementation. A  recommendation  of  10µg  (400  IU)  a  day  has  been  made  for pregnant and lactating women and for people over the age of 65 years.  **Although this has been in place for sometime, there is concern that it is overlooked or not implemented by health professionals and the general public.** 

7.         Deficiency  of  vitamin  D  results  in  rickets  and  osteomalacia.  The incidence  of  rickets  in  the  UK  declined  from  the  1920s  onwards, which  can  partly  be  attributed  to  better  living  conditions,  a reduction  in  atmospheric  pollution,  changes  in  diet,  mandatory fortification of margarine with vitamin D and replacement of cow’s milk  by  infant  formula  during  the  first  year  of  life.  Rickets  and osteomalacia  are  now  reported  rarely  among  the  white  UK population although there is evidence of significant incidence in UK South Asian and Afro-Caribbean groups. There is also recognition of a  high  prevalence  of  low  vitamin  D  status  among  older  people, particularly  those  living  in  institutions.  However,  there  are  no population-based estimates of incidence and it is likely that many cases do not reach clinical attention. This has implications for long- term health and well-being.

8.          A low vitamin D status has been implicated in a range of diseases including  osteoporosis,  several  forms  of  cancer,  cardiovascular disease,  tuberculosis,  multiple  sclerosis  and  type  I  diabetes. Osteomalacia and osteoporosis both increase the risk of fracture. Research in these areas is developing, but evidence is inconclusive at present,   and   further   work   is   needed   before   any   definitive conclusions can be drawn.
