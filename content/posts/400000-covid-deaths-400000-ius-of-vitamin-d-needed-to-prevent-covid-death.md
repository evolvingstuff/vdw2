#### $7 of Vitamin D can substantially reduce the risk for COVID-19 for a year

A bottle of 50,000 IU of Vitamin D typically costs $23 ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Tech-Pharmacal-D3-50-100-Count/dp/B000A0F2B2/ref=sr_1_9?crid=3D4LBB3F623LT&dchild=1&keywords=bio-tech+pharmacal+vitamin+d3&qid=1610923819&sprefix=bio-tech%2Caps%2C221&sr=8-))

A bottle typically contains 100 capsules costing 23 cents each (12 suppliers)

Most adults can restore their vitamin D levels by taking one just daily for a week

The restored immune system can be maintained for a year with just one capsule every two weeks

That results in at least a [2X and perhaps a 4X reduced](https://VitaminDWiki.com/COVID-19+treated+by+Vitamin+D+-+studies%2C+reports%2C+videos#Observe_-_Less_likely_to_become_infected) risk of getting COVID=19 symptoms
