#### Household contacts have better Vitamin D levels andmore activated Vitamin D Receptors - Oct 2019

 **Association of Fok1 VDR polymorphism with Vitamin D and its associated molecules in pulmonary tuberculosis patients and their household contacts.**

Status of Fok I VDR polymorphism along with vitamin D, Vitamin D receptor (VDR), and cathelicidin levels in Tuberculosis (TB) patients compared to household contacts and implication of these findings in susceptibility to TB is not known. 150 active TB patients, 150 household contacts and 150 healthy controls were recruited from North Indian population. Fok1 VDR polymorphism was studied by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).VDR mRNA and protein levels were studied using quantitative real time PCR (q rt PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Cathelicidin and Vitamin D levels were measured using ELISA and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) respectively. Significant association was found between Fok1 polymorphism and susceptibility to TB (P < 0.0005). VDR mRNA, VDR protein and vitamin D levels were significantly lower in active TB group when compared to household contacts and healthy controls (P < 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.0005 respectively). Cathelicidin levels were higher in active TB patients compared to other groups (P < 0.0001). Expression of VDR and cathelicidin was significantly higher among 'FF' genotypes of VDR (more active form of VDR) compared to 'ff' genotype (less active form of VDR). 'f' allele was associated with increased susceptibility to TB. Higher frequency of 'F' allele, increased VDR expression along with increased vitamin D levels in household contacts compared to active TB group might be responsible for protection against active TB.
