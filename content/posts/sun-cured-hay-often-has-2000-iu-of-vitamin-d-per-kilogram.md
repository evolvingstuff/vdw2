# [Fresh hay has 2000 IU of vitamin D per kilogram 1999](http://horse.purinamills.com/nutrition/vitamind.asp%20)

By Christine Barakat

 **Fast fact: Vitamin D is the only nutrient more abundant in dried forage than in fresh.** 

How your horse uses it: Both types of vitamin D-D2 and D3-help maintain your horse's critical electrolyte balance by binding to calcium and magnesium, aiding in their absorption.

Where it's found: Your horse synthesizes vitamin D3 within his body when ultraviolet rays from sunlight combine with a form of cholesterol naturally present in his skin. Vitamin D2 is found in the dried leaves of cut plants that have been exposed to sunlight-in other words, hay.

Dietary requirements: No specific requirements for vitamin D in horses have been established, but a horse who spends several hours a day outside or who receives dried forage will get a sufficient amount.  **Sun-cured hay initially contains 2,000 IU of vitamin D per dried kilogram** . Hay stored for one year, however, has only 39 percent of its original vitamin D.

## If he doesn't get enough:

Deficiencies of vitamin D are extremely rare. Those created in clinical situations resulted in rickets-like bone changes, including lowered bone density and difficulty in walking.

If he gets too much: A horse who receives too much vitamin D, which happens almost exclusively through oversupplementation, develops calcifications of the heart and other soft tissues. Too much Vitamin D added to a young horse's diet to prevent skeletal disease can induce toxicity.
