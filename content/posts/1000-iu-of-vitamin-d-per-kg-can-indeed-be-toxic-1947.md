#### There were many studies in the 1940’s stating that   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 1000 IU of vitamin D  **<span style="color:#00F;">per kilogram of body weight</span>**  was toxic.

The average weight of an adult was approximately 70 kg, so yes, I agree, 70,000 IU of vitamin D can be toxic.   
I had often wondered why doctors had been told that 1,000 or 2,000 IU of vitamin D was toxic.   
My guess is that the old message was trimmed to 1,000 IU of vitamin D is toxic,   
Note in the clipping belows that even 35 X higher was sometimes not toxic.
