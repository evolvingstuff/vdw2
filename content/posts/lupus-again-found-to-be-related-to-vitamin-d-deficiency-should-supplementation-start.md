BACKGROUND: Low serum vitamin D concentrations have been reported in several autoimmune disorders. 

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether low serum vitamin D concentrations are related to disease activity of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

METHODS:  378 patients from several European and Israeli cohorts were pooled and their disease activity was measured by two different methods: 278 patients had SLE disease activity-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) scores and 100 patients had European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) scores. In order to combine the two systems the scores were converted into standardized values (z-scores), enabling univariate summary statistics for the two variables (SLEDAI-2K and ECLAM). The commercial kit, LIAISON 25-OH vitamin D assay (310900-Diasorin) was used to measure serum concentration of 25-OH vitamin D in 378 patients with SLE. RESULTS: /st> A significant negative correlation was demonstrated between the serum concentration of vitamin D and the standardized values (z-scores) of disease activity scores as measured by the SLEDAI-2K and ECLAM scales (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=-0.12, p=0.018). 

CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients with SLE originating from Israel and Europe vitamin D serum concentrations were found to be inversely related to disease activity. DOI: 10.1136/ard.2009.120329  PMID: 20439290
