Background Deficiency of vitamin D along with traumatic brain injury (TBI) augments the risk of injury severity. This possibly affects the therapeutic regimen prescribed for TBI which may pessimistically affects its outcome.

Methods Studies literature search was conducted in Google Scholar and PubMed. The inclusions were studies performed clinically on both male and female. All included studiesâ€™ references were also reviewed to find any additional relevance related to this review. Studies published in English were considered for this review. This review focuses upon the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in TBI and how it affects the Quality of life of the sufferer.

Results A total of 176 studies were reviewed and 58 were thoroughly focussed for review as they met inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrate that levels of vitamin D influence the recovery outcome after TBI. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to cause more deterioration in severe TBI than in patients with mild TBI.

Conclusion Paucity of vitamin D significantly affects the outcome after brain injury. This clearly validates the necessity for screening of vitamin D levels in neurological deficit in order to reduce the risk of morbidity in terms of neurocognitive disorder.
