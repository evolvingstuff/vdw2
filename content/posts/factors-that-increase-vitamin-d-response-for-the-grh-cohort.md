#### Important Nutrients to Make Sure You Are Getting Along with Vitamin D

 **[Grassrootshealth](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Important-Nutrients-to-Make-Sure-You-Are-Getting-Along-with-Vitamin-D.html?soid=1102722411090&aid=1o3gmmf_klw)** 

 **The calculations below show how much more supplemental vitamin D was needed, on average, for participants to achieve a vitamin D level of at least <span style="color:#00F;">40 ng/ml </span>(100 nmol/L), for those not taking each nutrient in supplement form compared to those taking each nutrient.** 

* 244%  more D needed if not taking both  **magnesium and K2** 

   * 146% more D needed if not  take at least 400 mg/day magnesium

   * 115% more D needed if not take at least 200 mcg/day of vitamin K2

* 94% more D needed if not take at least 1,000 mg/day  **vitamin C** 

> Note: [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-taking-vitamin-c-decrease-AK9iTpBZR.ayuQPUiyP94Q) says that Vitamin C DOES NOT improve Vitamin D

* 72% more D needed if not  take probiotics

* 63% more D needed if not take at least 20 mg/day vitamin B6

* 61% more D needed if not take at least 500 mcg/day of  **vitamin B12** 

* 14% more D needed if not  take at least 500 mg/day calcium

 **[GRH data](https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/nutrients-factors-influence-vitamin-d-levels-dose-response/)** 

 **Example: addition of both Mg and K2 = <span style="color:black;background-color:yellow;">yellow line</span>**

#### Note: The general public probably will not have aa good of a response as GRH

GRH cohort is probably both healthier and younger

The general public has more chronic diseases that reduce response to vitamin D supplementation

The general public has more chronic diseases that consume vitamin D, and so reduces response

The general public is probably more obese than the GRH cohort

The general public probably does not eat as well as the GRH cohort

Would be interesting to compare the US population pyramid with the US GRH cohort

&nbsp; &nbsp; Suspect GRH participants are primarily aged 35-55
