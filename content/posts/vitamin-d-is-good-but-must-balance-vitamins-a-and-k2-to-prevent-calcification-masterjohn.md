### [Masterjohn video 36 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H7tbWVNrXQ%20)

Normally we have lots of Ca in the blood – which is needed to add Ca to bones

Normally do not have Ca being deposited in wrong locations – kidney stones, arteries

Deposition only happens when Vitamin D is increased without also increasing Vitamins A and K

It is interesting that the vitamin D problem did not occur until there was  **50,000 IU/kilogram/feed** 

Which appears to be about  **75,000 IU** per day for a human adult.

 **Note: 75,000 IU daily for just 4 weeks is toxic for humans - if not balance the cofactors**
