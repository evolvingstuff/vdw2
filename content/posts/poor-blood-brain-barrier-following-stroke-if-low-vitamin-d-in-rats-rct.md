 **Highlights** 

* Role of vitamin D hormone (VDH) was examined in maintaining BBB integrity in a rat model of stroke.

* VDH deficiency increased cerebral capillary permeability (IgG level) following stroke.

* VDH deficiency decreased the expression of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-5.

* Low serum VDH levels are likely to complicate stroke severity.

Because vitamin D hormone deficiency (VDHdef) can worsen severity and outcome for ischemic stroke, we examined the role of VDH in maintaining blood-brain-barrier (BBB integrity) in a rat model of stroke. In most types of stroke, the BBB is markedly compromised, potentially leading to a cascade of injury processes and functional deficits, so we examined a number of biomarkers associated with BBB disruption to determine whether VDH deficiency would further compromise the BBB following a stroke. 

Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of two diet cohorts, VDH-sufficient (VDHsuf) and VDHdef. The VDHsuf group was fed standard rat chow and the VDHdef group got a VDH-null version of the same diet for 8 weeks. Animals from both cohorts were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) surgery, killed at 72 h post-stroke, and their brains evaluated for BBB permeability and injury severity using expression of immunoglobulin (IgG), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity and alteration of tight junction (TJ) proteins as markers of BBB disruption. We also evaluated modulation of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), osteopontin (OPN), β-catenin and vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in VDHsuf and VDHdef subjects. At the time of MCAO, rats on the VDHdef diet had circulating VDH levels one-fourth that of rats fed control chow. IgG extravasation after MCAO, indicating more severe BBB injury, was significantly higher in the MCAO+VDHdef than the MCAO+VDHsuf rats. Following MCAO, expression of MMP-9, GLUT1, VDR and OPN increased and the TJ proteins occludin and claudin-5 decreased significantly in the VDHdef compared to the VDHsuf group. We also observed significantly lower expression of β-catenin in the MCAO group of both VDHsuf and VDHdef rats. Under these conditions, VDH deficiency itself can compromise the BBB. 

 **We think that low serum VDH levels are likely to complicate stroke severity and its chronic consequences.**
