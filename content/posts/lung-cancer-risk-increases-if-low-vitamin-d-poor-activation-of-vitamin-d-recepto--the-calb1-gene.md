#### Exploring the Role of Vitamin D, Vitamin D-Dependent Proteins, and Vitamin D Receptor Gene Variation in Lung Cancer Risk

Lung cancer has an unfavorable prognosis with a rate of low overall survival, caused by the difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages and resistance to therapy. In recent years, there have been new therapies that use specific molecular targets and are effective in increasing the survival chances of advanced cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to find more specific biomarkers that can identify early changes in carcinogenesis and allow the earliest possible treatment. Vitamin D (VD) plays an important role in immunity and carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulates the expression of various genes involved in the physiological functions of the human organism. The genes encoding the VDR are extremely polymorphic and vary greatly between human populations. To date, there are significant associations between VDR polymorphism and several types of cancer, but the data on the involvement of VDR polymorphism in lung cancer are still conflicting. Therefore, in this review, our aim was to investigate the relationship between VDR single-nucleotide polymorphisms in humans and the degree of risk for developing lung cancer. The studies showcased different gene polymorphisms to be associated with an increased risk of lung cancer: TaqI, ApaI, BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2. In addition, there is a strong positive correlation between VD deficiency and lung cancer development. Still, due to a lack of awareness, the assessment of VD status and VDR polymorphism is rarely considered for the prediction of lung cancer evolution and their clinical applicability, despite the fact that studies have shown the highest risk for lung cancer given by TaqI gene polymorphisms and that VDR polymorphisms are associated with more aggressive cancer evolution.
