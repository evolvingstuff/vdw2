#### Vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 Infection: SERVE Study (SARS-CoV-2 Exposure and the Role of Vitamin D among Hospital Employees)

Context: Recognition of the role of vitamin D in immune function has led to interest in its relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although clinical studies to date have had conflicting results, many individuals currently take high doses of vitamin D to prevent infection. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and vitamin D supplement use with incident SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study 250 healthcare workers were enrolled at a single institution and followed for 15 months. Participants completed questionnaires every 3 months regarding new SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, and supplement use. Serum was drawn at baseline, 6, and 12 months for 25OHD and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies.

Results: Mean age of participants was 40 years, BMI 26 kg/m2, 71% were Caucasian, and 78% female. Over 15 months, 56 participants (22%) developed incident SARS-CoV-2 infections. At baseline, âˆ¼50% reported using vitamin D supplements (mean daily dose 2250 units). Mean serum 25OHD was 38 ng/ml. Baseline 25OHD did not predict incident SARS-CoV-2 infection (Odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> 0.98, 95% CI 0.80-1.20). Neither use of vitamin D supplements (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.65-2.14), nor supplement dose was associated with incident infection (OR 1.01 per 100-units increase, 95% CI 0.99 - 1.02).

Conclusion: In this prospective study of health care workers, neither serum 25OHD nor use of vitamin D supplements was associated with incident SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings argue against the common practice of taking high dose vitamin D supplements for presumed prevention of COVID-19.
