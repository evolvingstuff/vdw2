**Vitamin D is a great way to quickly strengthen an immune system** 

 **Vitamin D fights many enveloped viruses like Ebola** 

 **Only a strong immune system allows people to survive Ebola** 

 **A vitamin D strengthened immune systems should:** 

 **&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Increase how many will never get an Ebola symptom** 

 **&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decrease how many will die of Ebola** 

 **Vitamin D has not (yet) been proven to fight Ebola - that is what we intend to do** 

 **Rain is one of the many reasons for low D and low immunity in West Africa**

### 400,000 IU of vitamin D to every person - taken as a single dose

[~~#F00:__Red line__ ~~shows how quickly vitamin D levels are boosted](/posts/healthy-in-seven-days-loading-dose-of-vitamin-d-book-2014)

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

##### 400,000 IU ($1.20) per person, &nbsp; &nbsp; < $36 of vitamin D to save a life

$1.20 for 400,000 IU: assuming 50,000 IU capsule costs ~ 15 cents

IF we assume that the death rate in a household having Ebola is 10% 

&nbsp; &nbsp; and IF we assume that vitamin D reduces the death rate by only 30%

THEN will need 30 doses to save a life!  

Thus: $36 of vitamin D will save a life (30 X $1.20)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Costs per dose and per life will be lower with future 400,000 IU capsules

<!-- ~tc~ !!!Pilot Test  to Confirm Vitamin D will quickly boost immune systems & fight Ebola
#Offer a ((Overview Loading of vitamin D|loading dose)) of 400,000 IU of vitamin D to ~ 500 people
+Loading dose should strengthen the immune system very quickly - approximately 3 days
+The loading dose (costing approx $1.20) will result in about 2 months of a protected Immune System.
+Use organizations which are already in West Africa
+Probably focus on the most at-risk individuals: those somewhat likely to die of Ebola in the next month:
+ ~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~ e.g. people living in home with an Ebola patient - most of whom are turned away from already full clinics
#Check back in 1 month to record death statistics (very few in homes get symptoms without then dying)
+Compare rates to similar individuals who did not get vitamin D
+Define success = at least a 30% reduction in deaths, (Chart above shows a potential 70% reduction)

{BOX(title=>Phase 1 Details: distributing vitamin D and collecting data class="border" bg=>#FFC,width="750px")}
__Distribution__
To individuals in households which has/had a person with Ebola
The amount of vitamin D given should be somewhat proportional to the weight of the individual
We suggest the following (50,000 IU vitamin D capsules)
|| capsules|kg |lb|individual
8 |70 kg |150|adult
10|100 kg |220|overweight adult
6|55 kg|120 |lightweight
4|32 kg| 70|child
2|9 kg|20 |infant ||
All of the vitamin D would hopefully would be taken during the visitation (this ensures compliance)
The Vitamin D is typically taken in capsule form.
If the people fear the contents: put the capsules +1 on a tray 
~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~ Have the individual indicate which one the distributor should take - to prove that capsule are OK
~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~ Note: a  distributor can safely take as many as 40 capsules in a 10 day time period
The capsules can be opened by twisting or cutting and the powder can be sprinkled on food or drink
__Intial Visit/Data Collection - if possible__
Record Identifier for the group - such as address, family name
Record How long has the primary person has had symptoms - approximate # of days
Record Age or weight of each person getting the vitamin D, # capsules, and symptoms Y/N
Record Age or weight of each person in the household who did not get the vitamin D
__Followup Visit/Data Collection in 5-30 days__
Record group identifier: name /address
Record number of days since first visit
Record status of each individual and indicate number of capsules (0-10) during the first visit
~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~ symptomatic currently Y/N, never symptomatic, unknown (perhaps moved away), died
(Note - more people might get initial dose vitamin D in future visits - as they see that it works)
Note: The initial dose lasts about 2 months (= half-life)
Can optionally give a boost with about 1/4 the number of capsules after 30 days
~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~  e.g. 6 or 8, ==>4; ~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~10==>3; ~hs~ ~hs~ ~hs~2 or 4==>1

 **There has been <span style="color:#F00;">1 </span> suspected vitamin D death in the last decade in the entire world** 

 **There could be <span style="color:#F00;">1,000</span> Ebola deaths if wait for "proof" from a trial.** 

 **Doctors and researchers contacted uniformly said vitamin D might help and it certainly would not hurt.** 

### Large Scale distribution of Vitamin D

 **Give 400,000 IU of vitamin D 12,000 people per week (1,000 bottles of 50,000 IU Vitamin D)** 

 **VIA such channels as** 

* Contact workers - where the household already has/had an Ebola infection

* Home Care Kit distribution

* Churches (which provides the best vocal instruction - essential for a population with low literacy)

1. People living with Ebola infectious person (the only group in phase 1)

1. People still in house where an Ebola person had lived

1. Health care workers with high infection rates

1. Ambulance and/or burial crews

1. Others with known contact with an Ebola-infectious person

1. Those having symptoms which are suspected to be Ebola - both inside and outside of clinics

1. Those in contact with the West African public (employees in stores, restaurants, taxis, airport, buses, , , , )

1. Military: Local, US, UK, etc.

1. Persons leaving West Africa - to reduce possibility of spreading Ebola.

1. Add maintenance dose of vitamin D - to have a strong immune system  for more than 2 months - using perhaps 50,000 IU every two weeks)

1. Try increased or decreased Vitamin D loading dose for average adult

1. Try increased Vitamin D loading dose for those at high risk of being vitamin D deficient: pregnant, elderly, obese, etc.

> This increased dosing might be done in Phase 1

1. Try additional immune system boosters such as: Red Marine Algae, Vitamin C - especially if there is an indication of fast response.

 **Can ramp up the manufacturing to 120,000 per week fairly quickly** 

 **The limitation is that the doses should be individually packaged by either** 

1. Putting eight small 50,000 IU capsules in a small bag/bottle

1. Manufacturing a large 400,000 IU capsule

 **Note about children: 400,000 IU will raise the vitamin D levels of many children to > 100 ng/mL** 

While many researchers feel that it is desirable to not have the levels so high,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it is far more desirable that the children do not die of Ebola.

 **It is difficult to:**  

1. Distribute different dose sizes 

1. Communicate how many capsules each member of a family should take. 

> (Only about half of West Africa is literate)

Large doses are not necessarily a problem

East Germany gave 600,000 doses of vitamin D to ALL of its infants for 30 years - with no recorded problems

### Rain is one of the many reasons for low D and low immunity in West Africa

1. Rainy Season (similar to winter) ==> people outdoors less ==> less vitamin D generated

> Note <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-lowest-in-summer-in-some-tropical-countries" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2954">Vitamin D lowest in summer in some tropical countries</a>

1. Poor sanitation in slums ==> vitamin D is consumed by [inflammation](/categories/inflammation), etc.

1. [Women want whiter skins](/posts/women-around-the-world-want-whiter-skin) ==> stay out of the sun ==> Reduce Vitamin D

1. <a href="/posts/overview-pregnancy-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Pregnancy and vitamin D">Pregnancy</a> ==> often drops the vitamin D levels considerably

1. Fear of Ebola ==>[Stress ==> consumes vitamin D](/posts/mental-stress-significantly-lowered-the-vitamin-d-levels-of-heart-patients)

1. Stresses of unemployment, friends dying ==> stressful ==> consumes vitamin D

1. Working long hours (health care workers) ==> stress ==> lowers immune system

#### Cremations (now required) may be the reason for reduced "reported" Liberian deaths

* [Ebola cremation ruling prompts secret burials in Liberia](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/ebola-cremation-ruling-secret-burials-liberia) Guardian Oct 27

>** Treatment centres half-empty as families keep infected at home to avoid presidential decree that Ebola victims must be cremated **> Cremation violates values and cultural practices in the western African country. 

> The order has so disturbed people that the sick are often kept at home and, if they die, are being secretly buried, increasing the risk of more infections.

> President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf decreed in** August **that the bodies of Ebola victims in the Monrovia area be cremated.

> there won’t be a place to honour deceased relatives. Nor are the relatives permitted to be at the cremation or get the ashes

> Sierra Leone has not ordered cremations.Their Ebola treatment units are often full.

#### West Point slum in Liberia with huge Ebola outbreak is being quarantined - Nov 2

* [In Liberian slum, Ebola quarantine magnifies misery](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/11/02/liberia-ebola-slum/18244091/) USA Today Nov 2

* estimates put the population of West Point at 75,000

* In West Point, people live close together in wooden and corrugated metal shacks, often sleeping dozens to a room, on blankets on a mud floor

* Most don't have toilets — there are four communal ones in the entire slum

#### Rainy season ending in Liberia, vitamin D levels rising, Ebola declining

##### My guess: Rain ==> low vitamin D ==> poor Immune System ==> Ebola growth

[WHO data of Ebola daily growth - on Wikipedia](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa#/Timeline_of_cases_and_deaths)

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/ebola-daily-growth.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

3%/day = Ebola double every 24 days

0.5%/day = Ebola double every 144 days =~ half year = very slow growth

Monrovia rainfall Sept & Oct: = 750 mm/month = about 1 inch per day average

[Monrovia Average Monthly Rainfall](http://www.bbc.com/weather/2274895) BBC has the following bar chart

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/monrovia-rain.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

Now that the Liberian sun is coming back I expect that the Ebola growth rate will become negative sometime in Nov.

End of rainy season for Liberia: More sun, Less disease

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is a play on the words for our video: [Does Less Sun Mean More Disease?](/posts/does-less-sun-mean-more-disease)

Note: West Africa has so much rain that the skin colors are less black.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/liberia-skin-color.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

Recall: Vitamin D levels are low during pregnancy. From Wikipedia: "no reported cases of pregnant mothers and unborn babies surviving Ebola in Sierra Leone.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus it appears: Low vitamin D (due to pregnancy ==> poor immune system ==> Ebola wins

#### US military leaving Liberia via Italy are being put into quarantine- Oct 27

### Fast Ebola testers being tried in Africa

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

* [Small device can test for Ebola in 15 minutes](http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/health-med-fit-science/small-device-can-test-ebola-15-minutes/ngxFP/) Aug 2014

* CEO of the company had  previously lead the team that made the 800 pound gorilla of testers in the past which are now used in [CDC facilities](http://www.bt.cdc.gov/lrn/)

* The price for the device is $3,000 to $5,000 and the cost of a test per patient is about $25 dollars.

* Research paid by Homeland Security - [and updated Oct 10, 2014](http://www.biospace.com/News/positiveid-psid-and-ensco-awarded-contract-for-u-s/349681)

* Microfluidics provides Real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) chemistry

* Unfortunately it is not (currently) expected to be at airports for 2 years

* Apparently PCR test can detect Ebola with good confidence 3 days AFTER symptoms 

* [Larger PCR testers](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/opinion/how-to-quarantine-against-ebola.html?_r=0) NYT 

> 3 /1000 false positives (incorrectly saying that Ebola was present), 

> 4 / 1000 false negatives (failed to detect Ebola)

* Unknown: # of testers needed to test say 600 people per hour. 100?

* Hopefully it is now on a fast-track to get deployed soon.

* Testing of** pre-symtomatic  **Ebola patients published in [Lancet (2000)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673600024053) is interesting (reported in [NYT Oct 12, 2014](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/opinion/how-to-quarantine-against-ebola.html?_r=0))

> 4/11 false negatives, 0/13 false positives -

> Thus some infected people would be missed - but about 60% would be detected - Which is far better than if there were no testing

* [Dr. Levy Oct 19 update](http://www.naturalhealth365.com/treatment-for-ebola-multi-c-protocol-1181.html)

##### Comment by VitaminDWiki on use of massive doses of Vitamin C

The human body is not used to massive doses of vitamin C

Taken orally, it appears that normal Vitamin C would have to be taken >10 times per day

Vitamin C could also be taken intravenously.

In both cases I suspect that medical observation would be needed to look for resulting imbalances in the body

There are, however, VERY FEW medical personnel in many countries concerned with Ebola

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Example: Liberia has the same population as Kentucky, but has 400X fewer doctors

Have yet (Oct 6) to see ANY data to support the claim that Ebola consumes vitamin C

Have not seen any indication that massive vitamin C can PREVENT Ebola

##### Many supplements slowly build immune systems - which is OK if you have 3-6 months** Some have just a single ingredient, most have many combinations *** [BEST IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPLEMENTS](http://www.buyerreview.com/best-health-supplements/best-immune-system-supplements/?gclid=CjwKEAjww8eiBRCE7qvK9Z7W_DgSJABfOjf2cya9yTSUBA805Z79vW5IOglAa2Fy_OhS2sFHs86a_xoCo4Hw_wcB) 10  - updated Oct 29

### Red marine algae might PREVENT and TREAT Ebola in humans

* [Red Algae Extract Fights Ebola ... and HIV, SARS and HCV](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/red-algae-extract-fights-ebola-and-hiv-sars-and-hcv) GreenMedInfo Oct 2014

> Summary after a quick read: 

> 1) 30% of people infected with Ebola did not get symptoms a decade ago

> 2) Those people had developed antibodies via mechanism called** mannose-binding lectins **and griffithsin

> 3) Red marine algae also produces griffithsin

> 4) Tests were made giving a recombinant form both before and after giving Ebola to mice , 

> 5) More mice survived Ebola in both cases.

So: it appears that red marine algae might both prevent Ebola and as well as treat early stage Ebola.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Noticed that there were > 190 suppliers of red marine algae supplements on Amazon (US) - Oct 2014

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None of the suppliers seem to provide % ingredient information on Amazon - need to do some research

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have no idea if 1 gram or 100 grams of the stuff is needed

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have no idea if it takes months to build up the immune system with red marine algae

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Basically - lots and lots of unknowns
