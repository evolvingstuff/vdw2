!!!! £ 5,000 funding for nursery staff who run Vitamin D projects: Date of article: 25-Jul-12
[http://www.daynurseries.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1557577/5000-pounds-funding-for-nursery-staff-who-run-vitamin-d-projects|Article by: Sue Learner, News Editor]

Nursery staff who run projects that support vitamin supplements and the promotion of vitamin D intake in children under five, could be eligible for £5,000 grants.

The Feeding for Life Foundation (FfLF) has launched a Promoting Best Practice Grant Scheme to provide a total of £20,000 worth of funding for grass roots projects.

The issue of vitamin D deficiency has been placed back on the public health agenda as a result of the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS), which found toddlers are only achieving an average of 27 per cent of the recommended dietary intake of vitamin D from food sources.

The recent FfLF &amp;#39;Mind the Gap&amp;#39; report found 51 per cent of health care professionals and 74 per cent of parents surveyed were unaware of the Department of Health recommendations that all pregnant and breastfeeding women and children aged six months to five years should take a vitamin D supplement.

In response to the growing concern over poor vitamin D intake, the UK’s chief medical officers wrote to health care professionals to remind them of the importance of vitamin D supplementation and to highlight the groups most at risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Pinki Sahota, professor of nutrition and obesity at Leeds Metropolitan University and chair of the FfLF, said: &amp;quot;The issue of vitamin D deficiency is becoming an increasing problem in the UK.

&amp;quot;This scheme aims to help health care professionals and early years professionals tackle this issue and share best practice, by funding initiatives that raise awareness of the importance of vitamin D supplementation amongst parents of young children.&amp;quot;

You can find out further information on the Promoting Best Practice Grant Scheme on the Feeding for Life Foundation website.

Closing dates for 2012 applications are Friday 14th September and Monday 31st December.

!The relationship between vitamin d and severe early childhood caries: a pilot study.
Int J Vitam Nutr Res. 2012 Jan;82(1):53-62.
Schroth R, Jeal N, Kliewer E, Sellers E.
University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and Manitoba Institute of Child Health, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Introduction: Children with Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC) routinely require dental surgery. S-ECC is known to affect childhood health and well-being. The objective of this pilot study was to assess vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and determine whether differences exist between children with and without S-ECC. 

Methods: During July-September 2008, children undergoing surgery for S-ECC &amp;lt; 72 months of age from southern Manitoba were recruited. Age-matched controls were caries-free. Parents completed an interviewed questionnaire. A serum sample was obtained for 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This study was approved by the University of Manitoba?s Ethics Board. Statistics included chi-square analysis, t-tests, and multiple and logistic regression. A p value of &amp;lt;= 0.05 was significant. 

Results: Thirty-eight children participated (50 % with S-ECC). There was no significant age difference between groups (p = 0.82). 

The majority of the entire sample (84.2 %) had inadequate vitamin D levels. 

Children with S-ECC had lower concentrations of 25(OH)D (52.9 ± 15.1 nmol/L vs. 64.4 ± 21.3, p = 0.032) and were at __twice the odds of having inadequate levels (&amp;lt;75 nmol/L)__. Children with S-ECC also had significantly higher PTH levels than caries-free children (53.5 ± 17.6 cm/L vs. 33.9 ± 12.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001). A greater number with S-ECC had elevated PTH levels (68.4 % vs. 21.1 %, p &amp;lt; 0.01). 

Conclusions: This pilot study is the first to report differences in 25(OH)D between those with S-ECC and cavity-free controls. Children with S-ECC have lower vitamin D levels and increased PTH levels compared to age-matched controls.

!!!Comment by VitaminDWiki
Vitamin D [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1270|Cofactors] such as Calcium, Magnesium, and Vitamin K2, are also very important in making bone and teeth.
Also helpful are elements which are non cofactors, such as Boron, Silicon, and Strontium

!!!!Vitamin D intake in young children with acute lower respiratory infection
Karen S Leis, J Dayre McNally, Matthew R Montgomery, Koravangattu Sankaran, Chandima Karunanayake, Alan M Rosenberg
Translational Pediatrics

Objective: To determine if vitamin D intake is associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children.

Methods: The vitamin D intakes of children younger than 5 years of age admitted to hospital with either bronchiolitis or pneumonia were compared to an unmatched control group of the same age without respiratory infection. 

Caregivers of 197 children completed a questionnaire collecting information on demographic variables, ALRI risk factors and diet.

Associations of ALRI with vitamin D intake and other ALRI risk factors were determined.

Results: The mean vitamin D intake of children with ALRI was 48 IU/kg/d compared to 60 IU/kg/d in the control group.

When controlling for age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, northern residence, breastfeeding, immunizations and smoking contact, children with a vitamin D intake of less than 80 IU/kg/d were greater than 4 times more likely to have ALRI compared to children with a vitamin D intake exceeding __80 IU/kg/day (OR 4.9__, CI: 1.5, 16.4).

Conclusions: A higher vitamin D intake than currently recommended might be needed to offer protection against diseases such as ALRI. 
Increased vitamin D supplementation could have important public health consequences, as bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common reasons for hospitalization in young children.
