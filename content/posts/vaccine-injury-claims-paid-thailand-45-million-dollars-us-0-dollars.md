#### The ‘Dark Truth’ Behind America’s ‘Vaccine Court’ - book - May 2022

 **[The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/truth-americas-vaccine-court/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=67d524ee-2fdd-4838-b445-ccad24be7f3d)** 

 **[The Vaccine Court 2.0: Revised and Updated](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1510758372?tag=simonsayscom) Amazon $17 - June 2021 no Kindle edition as of May 2022** 

* The Vaccine Court looks at the mysterious and often unknown world of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), the only recourse for seeking compensation for those who have been injured by a vaccine. The NVICP, better known as the ”Vaccine Court,” however, is not without controversy.

* Established by Congress as a direct result of the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, the NVICP was supposed to offer a no-fault alternative to the traditional injury claims filed in state or federal courts and was to provide quick, efficient, and fair compensation for those who have been injured by vaccines.  **The reality, however, is that many cases take several years or longer to complete and require tremendous commitment**  from families already pushed to the brink of bankruptcy caring for the vaccine-injured family member, only to discover that the end result is manipulated by the government in defense of the US vaccine policy.

* Mr. Rohde looks into the inner workings of the US Federal Claims Court and the NVICP. He interviews families who have filed petitions and won compensation, families who have been denied compensation, and families still waiting for a decision. By highlighting the journeys of these families—their efforts to find attorneys willing to represent them, the filing of their petitions, and the subsequent mountain of paperwork, medical records, and other documents that span years—Mr. Rohde exposes the bitter truth behind the NVICP. Through his thoughtful interviews and fact-finding research, The Vaccine Court sheds light on how the NVICP has evolved into something far more treacherous than what Congress envisioned with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in 1986.
