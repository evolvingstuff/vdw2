The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). 

However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. 

Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. 

Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. 

The parenteral multi–trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

## Vitamin D deficiency in patients receiving home parenteral nutrition.

JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2011 Jul;35(4):499-504. [doi: 10.1177/0148607110381269.](https://doi.org/10.1177/0148607110381269.) Epub 2011 May 3.

BACKGROUND:

In addition to its role in bone metabolism, vitamin D has important immunomodulatory and antineoplastic effects. Patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) receive most of their vitamin D from intravenous (IV) supplementation. Vitamin D deficiency is common in the general population, and the adequacy of vitamin D supplementation in HPN patients is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the vitamin D status of patients on HPN.

METHODS:

Consecutive patients seen in a regional home nutrition program had their oral and IV vitamin D intakes determined. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured in all patients. Intake of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate were also determined.

RESULTS:

The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in 22 patients receiving HPN for a mean of 33.5 months (range, 1-177) was 42 nmol/L. Vitamin D deficiency was present in 15 (68%) patients and vitamin D insufficiency in 6 (27%) patients. The mean dietary vitamin D intake was 79.5 IU per day, while the  **mean IV supplementation was 166 IU per day.** 

CONCLUSIONS:

In this study of a regional Canadian HPN program, there was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency affecting virtually all patients. All patients receiving HPN should be supplemented with vitamin D and have their 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels monitored. Further studies are required to determine optimal methods and dosing of vitamin D replacement using oral supplements or ultraviolet light therapy.

## Vitamin D Deficiency and Low Bone Mineral Density in Pediatric and Young Adult Intestinal Failure.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and predisposing factors for vitamin D deficiency and low bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with intestinal failure (IF). METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with IF managed at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. IF was defined as history of parenteral nutrition (PN) >30 days. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25-OH vitamin D <span>[25(OH) D]</span> <20 ng/dL. Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) was defined using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Z-score ≤ - 2. A binary logistic regression model was used to test for association of significant risk factors and the outcome variables after univariate analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty three patients with median age of 4 years (range 3-22 years) were evaluated. Forty-nine  **(39.8%) patients had at least a documented serum 25 (OH) D deficiency**  during the study interval while 10 out of 80 patients (12.5%) with DXA scans done had a low BMD Z-score. Age at study entry was associated with both 25 (OH) D deficiency (P = 0. 01) and low BMD Z-score (P = 0. 03). Exclusive PN at study entry was associated with reduced bone mass (P = 0.03). There was no significant association between vitamin D deficiency and low BMD Z-score (P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The risk of 25 (OH) D deficiency and low BMD Z-score increases with age among patients with IF. Strategies for monitoring and preventing abnormal bone health in older children receiving exclusive PN need to be developed and evaluated.
