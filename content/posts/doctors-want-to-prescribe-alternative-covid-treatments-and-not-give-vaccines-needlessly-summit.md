#### Top Doctors at Summit Today: "Healthy Children Shall Not Be Subject to Forced Vaccination"

 **[from Rescue Substack](https://rescue.substack.com/p/top-doctors-at-summit-today-healthy)** 

The world's finest Covid-19 doctors present the science today at the Florida Covid Summit, as a New York rabbinical court & a California mom's revolution join the fight.

Never in U.S. history has the government demanded doctors not treat sick people. These are the leaders of “the 500 doctors who saved the world” who defied the NIH & CDC and developed treatment protocols of cocktails of FDA-approved, safe, legal drugs, including ivermectin, that saved masses of people.

The top Covid-19 doctors and clinician-scientists in the world, including 

 **Robert Malone, Pierre Kory, Peter McCullough, Paul Marik, Richard Urso, Ryan Cole, Paul Alexander, Heather Gessling, and Brian Tyson** , 

are leading the Florida Covid Summit today in Ocala to present overwhelming scientific evidence that tells the world definitively: There shall be no Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children.

“This is an important day in the history of this country,” said Dr. John Littell, the Ocala family physician who organized the summit that is drawing nearly a thousand doctors from across the United States in the largest science-backed protest against the leave-no-child-left-unvaccinated government policy led by President Biden and the country’s public health authorities, but opposed by countless millions of Americans. Walgreens and other chains are beginning the massive rollout of vaccines for children as young as five years old, despite the complete absence of benefit and profound risk, the doctors say. “It’s insane,” Dr. Urso said.

Dr. Littell said forced children’ vaccinations are a “slap in the face” to parents’ rights to determine health care for their children—and to the child’s “robust immune system,” which will be “usurped by a snippet of m-RNA” and never have the chance to develop natural immunity, with unknown and potentially deadly consequences.“

“I can’t believe they’re going after the kids,” said Dr. Pierre Kory, president and chief medical officer of the Frontline Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which reaches more than 100,000 supporters and a twitter audience of some 300,000 and led the development of treatments that have saved hundreds of thousands of lives globally.

“It’s beyond belief,” Dr. Kory said. “They’re going to kill kids. The vaccines are so toxic, and it’s unbelievable they’re going after the kids. The adverse event rates are through the roof. The chief one is myocarditis. The chances of being hospitalized with myocarditis caused by the covid vaccine is something like four to seven times higher than the chance of being hospitalized with covid.

“The risk benefit analysis shows you expose them to the toxicity of vaccines without any benefit. Our policy is you should not vaccinate healthy children.” A recent study by medpage.com and a group at Johns Hopkins University looked at the records of 42,000 children hospitalized with covid, he said, “and there was no healthy child who died of covid. Healthy kids don’t die of the flu either. There’s no deaths and very little hospitalization of health kids…

“And that’s just myocarditis. Never mind the adverse events. If you look at the Pfizer trial, a kid was paralyzed for life. Parents all over the place are trying to call attention to this. This is a humanitarian catastrophe. They’re killing people. Something like 12 to 20 teenagers have died from the vaccine.”

Dr. Kory and the other doctors authored the declaration of Rome this fall that defends the Hippocratic oath was signed by more than 14,000 physicians worldwide. This week they issued a “Declaration from the Physicians of the World” calling the doctors and Phd scientists around the globe to sign it in protest of unprecedented government control of doctors, the blatantly unscientific denial of natural immunity to force total mass vaccination, and especially the profound “dangers” of vaccination of young people with no benefit except to big Pharma profits and government power.

“So the Civil War begins,” a longtime journalist friend told me today. There are signs that this explosive new issue is overshadowing all others in the American culture war and globalist-versus-nationalist furies. The weightiest issues of immigration, climate, election integrity, national sovereignty, cancel culture, even the economy are blown away like so many feathers…on a mother’s breath. The issue is a populist cry that transcends borders and the boundaries of national identity, political orientation, race, age, sex, and religion.

Among the great universals, it is the greatest of all. It is about the children. It is always about the children. Politicians may know no fury like a mother’s rage against forced vaccinations for five year olds that top doctors and scientists say are potentially lethal pathogens, and have already paralyzed and killed teenagers that the government, doctors say, is covering up.

##### 7 hour video of summit

The Florida Summit doctors will discuss the science of covid treatments and vaccines and rally a change in public health policy Saturday at the World Equestrian Center in Ocala from 10 a.m.-3 p.m. The event will be live-streamed on globalcovidsummit.org and floridacovidsummit.org. Lectures include “Covid Vaccines & Children,” “Natural Immunity & the Covid Recovered,” “Vaccine Mandates: Role of Medical & Religious Exemptions,” and “Early Treatment of Covid: Challenges and Obstacles.”

 **[7 hour video](https://youtu.be/AOAdIYxvSYU?t=3147) starting at minute 52** 

 **[Dr, Korry of FLCCC](https://youtu.be/AOAdIYxvSYU?t=17460)** 

At the same time, in New York and New Jersey, a rabbinical court of scholars at the highest level of Jewish law, after “hearing eight hours of testimony from experts and other witnesses” on Covid vaccines, announced “our rabbinic decision, as per the teachings of our holy Torah – a definitive Halachic ruling,” that “it is absolutely forbidden to administer or even to promote this injection to children, adolescents, young men or women; even if it means that they will not be permitted by the government to attend yeshiva or seminary or to study abroad, etc. It is an explicit obligation to protest against this mandate, and anyone who can prevent the injection from being forced upon our youth must do so, forthrightly and emphatically.”

Meanwhile in California, thousands of outraged moms began meeting in houses and parks this week to plot revolt against Gov. Gavin Newsome’s decree of K-12 forced vaccinations for all school-age children. If you think that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe sparked a parental revolt that cost him the election by speaking these words —“I’m not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decision. I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach”— wait until state and federal officials claim the power to force an experimental, dangerous jab into their children’s arms.

I spoke to an organizer of the California mothers’ protesting childhood vaccinations, who said the women wanted to push the issue all across the American West, the United States and Europe. “These are classic American mothers with families who can’t afford to move to Texas to avoid this,” they said. “I’ve never seen passion and mobilization like this.”

Dr. Malone, the scientist who played a key role in developing the mRNA vaccine technology and has become famous speaking out against its potential dangers, said that the near-defeat yesterday of the Democratic New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, expected to win a landslide against his Republican opponent in the bluest of states, was the “clearest referendum on the Democratic party policies concerning management of SARS-CoV-2 public health response…much as the (R) win for Virginia Governor was a repudiation of (D) federal policy in VA.

“In my opinion, the ballot box is the only way to restore integrity and reason to the US public health response,” Dr. Malone continued on his Telegram channel. “Those affiliated with the (D) party are totally immune to objective, data-driven medical management strategies including early intervention.”

The  **[FLCCC Alliance](https://covid19criticalcare.com/)** , the group of five of the most published critical care doctors in the world led by Kory and Marik, is a bellwether for thousands of doctors globally use their life-saving covid treatment protocols for all stages of the disease in the absence of any guidance from the WHO or NIH except vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. The FLCCC maintains that their treatment protocols of cheap, safe, FDA-approved generic drugs are a bridge to vaccines and safety net that complements, does not replace, vaccination. But big pharma’s move on children as young as five changed part of this view of Kory, a father of young children. It took months of deliberation by the doctors of the FLCCC to take this step. It has galvanized massive support.

 **Dr. Kory has more than 171,000 twitter followers** . But his simple tweet today that he was in heading to Ocala for the weekend “to fight…injurious policies” sparked an overwhelming response:

The Florida Summit comes at a time that hundreds of thousands of Americans are taking ivermectin to prevent or treat covid-19, including more than 100 Congressmen and their families, because their doctors say it is remarkably safe and cuts illness and mortality by 60 yto 80 percent, unlike any covid treatment known to science. Meanwhile, the federal government and mainstream media’s attempt to keep up the propaganda farce stitched of many little beads of Big Lies that a Nobel prize winning medicine that is one of the safest human drugs in history is just a horse medicine…dangerous…causes liver disfunction…a zillion other woes. The battle of ivermectin is dividing families and the country and shaking faith in American intuitions like few others.

Many look to the Florida summit doctors as world leaders in covid treatments. Tragically, the vast majority of U.S. doctors simply don’t treat Covid patients—they are coerced into obeying the first federal decrees doctors can recall in the history off medicine to not treat sick patients, to just tell them to quarantine with no treatment until they’re ready to possibly face death in hospital, at a time when a pandemic virus is killing millions and  **<span style="color:#F00;">effective early treatments are available that could have prevented 85 percent of the 775,000 U.S. covid deaths, Dr. McCullough says</span>** .

Doctors have experienced unheard-of pressure and unprecedented threats and intimidation by hospital systems, which removed successful early treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine from their pharmacies and banned their use, in violation of medical ethics. “Doctors treating outpatients have been harassed and investigated by state medical boards,” Kory said.

“Historians will write about the inexplicable medial response to the fatal SARS-Cov-2 pandemic,” says Dr. Peter McCullough in his introduction to [Covid-19 and the Global Predators: We Are the Prey](https://www.amazon.com/COVID-19-Global-Predators-are-Prey/dp/0982456069), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin and his wife Ginger Ross Breggin, best-selling authors of Talking Back to Prozac. “Doctors edged out of the circle of empathy responded to their acutely ill patients by saying “I don’t treat Covid-19,” and were supported by the NIH and FDA, both of which actively obstructed any early treatment to sick Americans.”

Drs. Mark and Kory of the FLCCC, and Dr. McCullough who works with the AAPS, are leading physicians who defied the unprecedented global decrees from The WHO, NIH and CDC that no preventive or early treatments for covid were possible and patients should simply go to the hospital when they were facing death. They led “the 500 doctors who saved the world,” as McCullough calls them. These were the men and women who developed the top generic treatments from corticosteroids to ivermectin and fluvoxamine, saving hundreds of thousands of lives from Covid, while governments, media, and multinational pharmaceutical companies insanely tried to stop them to protect a vaccine-or-die policy.

And now they’ve all seen enough. Clinicians, not scientists, must lead pandemic treatment and response, they say, and the pandemic would end swiftly. “We’re all fed up,” said Dr. Bruce Boros of Key West, a pioneer of research and treatment using ivermectin who successfully treated hundreds of covid patients in his three urgent care clinics in the Florida Keys. “Doctors have been mistreated, our relationships with our patients torn apart, and we’re not going to take it anymore.”

#### The declaration states:

* WE, THE PHYSICIANS OF THE WORLD, united and loyal to the Hippocratic Oath, recognizing the imminent threat to humanity brought forth by current Covid-19 policies, are compelled to declare the following:

* WHEREAS, after 20 months of research, millions of patients treated, hundreds of clinical trials performed and scientific data shared, we have demonstrated and documented our success and understanding in combating COVID-19;

* WHEREAS, in considering the risks vs. benefits of major policy decisions, thousands of physicians and medical scientists worldwide have reached consensus on three foundational principles;

 **NOW THEREFORE, IT IS:** 

##### RESOLVED, THAT HEALTHY CHILDREN SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO FORCED VACCINATION

[(view supporting evidence)](https://doctorsandscientistsdeclaration.org/home/supporting-evidence/#children) 

##### RESOLVED, THAT NATURALLY IMMUNE PERSONS RECOVERED FROM SARS-CoV-2 SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY RESTRICTIONS OR VACCINE MANDATES

[(view supporting evidence](https://doctorsandscientistsdeclaration.org/home/supporting-evidence/#recovered)

##### RESOLVED, THAT ALL HEALTH AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS SHALL CEASE INTERFERING WITH PHYSICIANS TREATING INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS

The rabbinical court also forbid pregnant women and “all healthy adults who are of child-bearing age” from taking the vaccine that causes “much harm,” including micro blood clots, and may disrupt fertility. “There are many reports of women who do not stop bleeding for many months as a result of taking the injection,” the rabbis wrote, “making it impossible for them to achieve ritual purity, Heaven forbid. And for men, there are many reports of the injection leading to deficiencies in potency, Heaven forbid.”

They rabbis concluded even for elderly citizens, there was no substantial benefit in taking the vaccine when breakthrough cases occurred and the incidence of infection was similar whether one was vaccinated or not.

“There are many injuries and risks involved which can reasonably be suspected as having been caused by the injection for adults and senior citizens as well, for we have witnessed many elders who passed away shortly after receiving the mRNA,” they wrote. “Therefore – it is best to err on the side of caution and abstain from taking the injection, rather than endangering one's life by performing an action that can engender immediate and direct harm. Especially since there are other medical treatments that work, as mentioned, and that are not harmful.

The rabbis were speaking the language of the Florida Summit doctors and scientists when they urged “the importance of using the treatments very early, which has been shown to enhance their effectiveness. In addition, we cannot understate the importance of becoming more educated about the true facts – for example, by watching the testimonies – and in this way, assuaging the fear which has overtaken so many.

“In all the above,” they concluded, “we only taken into account the tragedies that have already befallen our community members – not long term effects, premonitions and frightening forecasts expressed in many of the testimonies we heard. May the Alm‐ghty save us. May the One who said "enough" when creating the world – say "enough" to our suffering.”
