The study recorded dose size and duration but failed to include that data in the published study

Study also failed to measure Vitamin D levels of each group.

Vitamin D can exert anticancer effect beyond bone and calcium metabolism. We aimed to investigate whether postoperative vitamin D supplementation affects quality of life (QOL) and survival in esophageal cancer (EC) patients. We utilized the widely used EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 to assess QOL at EC diagnosis and 24 months after surgery. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to analysis the association of vitamin D supplement use with QOL. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the prognostic value of vitamin D supplementation.  **The notably improved QOL were found among vitamin D supplementation users compared with non-users**  (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that vitamin D supplement use was significantly associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.030), but not related to overall survival (OS) (p = 0.303). The multivariable analysis further demonstrated vitamin D supplement use as an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.040; HR 0.610; 95% CI 0.381-0.978). 

 **In conclusion, these results showed that vitamin D supplement use could serve as a promising intervention to enhancing QOL and prolonging DFS in EC.**

. . "only 49 patients (16.2%) self-reported to regularly receive vitamin D supplement. The dosage of it was  **200–400 IU daily** , which was suggested by clinician and also recommended by Chinese Nutrition Society and World Health Organization. "

" In our study, EC patients who were supplemented with vitamin D had 

* higher scores of physical functioning, social functioning and global health as well as 

* lower scores of fatigue and appetite loss 

via a 24-month follow-up compared with non-users. It suggested that vitamin D users were more likely to maintain

physical function, have more energy and better appetite, feel less faintness as well as enjoy life. These findings

were consistent with previous study20, which reported that stage II colorectal cancer patients who supplemented 

vitamin D tended to have better QOL. Another cross-sectional study indicated that vitamin D deficiency was

quite common as well as associated with fatigue and poor physical and functional well-being in advanced cancer

patients19. Therefore, it pointed to vitamin D supplementation as a potential therapy to improve cancer patients’

QOL. Although vitamin D status is unknown in the current study, vitamin D supplement use did show a significant

relationship with QOL."
