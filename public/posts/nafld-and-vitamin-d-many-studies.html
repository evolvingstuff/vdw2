It can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and liver failure. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) in treating NAFLD. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted including studies published from January 2018 to June 2023. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trials and cohort studies involving human subjects or animal models with NAFLD. Data were extracted and analyzed to assess the impact of omega-3 PUFAs on liver fat, hepatic enzymes, and serum lipid profiles using RevMan 5.4. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Omega-3 supplementation significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (mean difference = -2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.36, -0.87) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (mean difference = -1.50, 95% CI = -2.59, -0.42). Gamma-glutamyl transferase levels showed a trend toward reduction (mean difference = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.66, 0.02). Serum lipid profiles improved significantly with reductions in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol along with significant reductions in AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase in animal models. Omega-3 PUFAs appear to offer beneficial effects on liver enzymes, serum lipid profiles, and anthropometric indices in NAFLD patients. While their impact on liver fat content remains uncertain, omega-3 supplementation could serve as a valuable adjunct treatment for enhancing metabolic profiles and liver function in NAFLD patients.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nafld-omega-3-meta-analysis-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=nafld-increased-12x-in-recent-years-in-those-under-18---oct-2023>NAFLD increased 12X in recent years in those under 18 - Oct 2023</h4><p><strong>NAFLD Has Become a Health Emergency Among Children - Mercola</strong></p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/nafld.png alt=image width=600><p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLzPDfT2RIQ&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=JayFeldmanWellness">1 hour YouTube video</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>NAFLD also affects up to 9.6% of American children aged 2 to 19, making it as common as asthma.

Despite its prevalence, no FDA-approved drug treatments specifically target NAFLD.</p><p>Aim: To provide a review of clinical trials investigating the use of herbal remedies and dietary supplements in NAFLD management, utilizing the ClinicalTrials.gov database.</p><p>Methods: This review evaluates the current evidence by examining completed phase III and IV clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. An exhaustive search was performed on April 17, 2023, using the terms &ldquo;Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease&rdquo; and &ldquo;NAFLD.&rdquo; Two independent reviewers appraised eligible trials based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p><p>Results: An initial search yielded 1,226 clinical trials, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria after filtration.</p><p>The majority of trials focused on</p><ul><li><p>Omega-3 fatty acids (20.0%) and</p></li><li><p>vitamin D (26.7%),</p></li></ul><p>followed by caffeine, chlorogenic acid, ginger, phosphatidylcholine, Trigonella Foenum-graecum seed extract, vitamin C, and vitamin E (each 6.7%).

Quadruple masking was the most prevalent technique (58.3%), and Iran was the leading country in terms of trial locations (25.0%). These interventions constitute two herbal interventions and nine supplement interventions.</p><p>Conclusion: This reveals a diverse range of nutraceuticals, with Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D being predominant in the management of NAFLD. The global distribution of trials highlights the widespread interest in these therapeutics.

These findings are of significant importance in guiding future research directions and collaborations, offering new perspectives and strategies for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Further research should delve into the mechanisms underlying the association between vitamin D and NAFLD, and more clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in the treatment of NAFLD.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/nafkd-vit-d-biblio-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=omega-3-should-be-considered-for-nafld-treatment---umbrella-meta-analysis-jan-2023>Omega-3 should be considered for NAFLD treatment - umbrella meta-analysis Jan 2023</h4><p><strong>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: An umbrella systematic review and meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology January 2023 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1681.13750>https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1681.13750</a> PDF can be rented for $12</p><p>Vali Musazadeh, Arash Karimi, Mahsa Malekahmadi, Sana Sedgh Ahrabi, Parvin Dehghan</p><p>There has been conflicting evidence from meta-analyses on the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, in this umbrella meta-analysis, we are evaluating whether omega-3 PUFA supplementation has any benefit in treating NAFLD. Electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase and Google Scholar were assessed to October 2022. This meta-analysis included all meta-analyses that examined the effect of PUFAs on liver fat and liver function tests <span>[aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)]</span>. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed.</p><p>In total, eight articles involving 6,561 participants met the eligibility criteria. Advantageous impacts PUFA supplementation were observed on ALT (ESWMD = −6.72 IU/L; 95% CI: −8.61, −4.84; p &lt; 0.001, and ESSMD = −0.52 IU/L; 95% CI: −0.84, −0.20, p &lt; 0.001), AST (ESWMD = −3.73 IU/L, 95% CI: −5.93, −1.53, p &lt; 0.001, and ESSMD = −0.65 IU/L; 95% CI: −1.08, −0.22, p = 0.003), GGT levels (ESWMD = −4.20 IU/L, 95% CI: −6.85, −1.55, p = 0.002), and liver fat (ESWMD = −5.16; 95% CI: −8.49, −1.82, p &lt; 0.001).

There are increasing scientific interests nowadays for the association between vitamin D status and Non-alcoholic fatty liver. Earlier studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients that contributes to poor outcomes. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral cholecalciferol on Non-alcoholic fatty liver patients.</p><p>Subjects and Methods: This study was conducted on 140 patients that were randomized either to group 1 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to placebo or group 2 that received the standard conventional therapy in addition to cholecalciferol during the 4 months study period.</p><p>Results: At the end of the study group 2 revealed significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in the mean serum level of TG, LDL-C, TC, hsCRP as compared to their baseline results and group 1 results. Additionally, a significant improvement in the serum levels of ALT (p = 0.001) was seen in group 2 at the end of the study when compared to group 1. Whereas group 1 did not show any change in these parameters when compared to group 2 and their baseline results.</p><p>Conclusion: Cholecalciferol was shown to have beneficial effects on serum ALT levels, hsCRP levels and lipid profile of NAFLD patients.

Over and above, the pleiotropic immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic roles VD plays in different disease settings started to surface in the past few decades. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence suggests a correlation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive inflammatory form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with vitamin D deficiency (VDD) owing to the former&rsquo;s ingrained link with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Accordingly, a better understanding of the contribution of VDR signalling to NAFLD incidence and progression would provide further insights into its diagnosis, treatment modalities, and prognosis, especially since hitherto, no drug for NAFLD has been approved. This review, therefore, sought to set forth the likely contribution of VDR signalling in NAFLD and how it might influence its multiple drivers.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
