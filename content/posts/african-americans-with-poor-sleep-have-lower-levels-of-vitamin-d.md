* “Polysomnography and actigraphy demonstrated that participants with vitamin D deficiencies had shorter sleeper duration, less REM sleep, and higher scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. In African-Americans, low vitamin D levels were significantly associated with shorter average sleep duration. There was no association between vitamin D levels and sleep duration with other races and ethnicities. Why the difference between races? While the answer is unclear, it may be due to differences in metabolism, receptor activity, and activation of vitamin D.”
