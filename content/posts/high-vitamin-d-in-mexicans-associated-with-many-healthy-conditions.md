 **Which is the cause and which is the affect?** 

1) High vitamin D ==> Healthier

2) Healthy person ==> takes more Vitamin D, etc.

Seems unlikely that such little vitamin D would have such big benefits - so probaby #2

 **High Vitamin D <span style="color:#00F;">consumption</span> is "associated with"** 

Less Obesity

Less Cholesterol

Take more supplements

Smoke less

More physically active

Less risk of Cardiovascular problems

Consume more sodium (normally thought to be unhealthy)

Consume more fiber 

Consume more saturated fats (normally thought to be unhealthy)

Consume more Magnesium (which is great for health)

BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D deficiency is a major global public health problem. Recent epidemiological studies have assessed the relationship between vitamin D and multiple outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. However, this evidence is limited and inconclusive. Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the association between dietary vitamin D intake and cardiovascular disease risk in adult Mexican population.

METHODS:

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with the baseline data from 6294 men and women aged 20-80 years participating in the Health Workers Cohort Study. Data on sociodemographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors were collected with a self-administered questionnaire. Dietary intake was evaluated by using a semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Cardiovascular disease risk was calculated using a recalibration of the Framingham heart disease prediction score. To evaluate the association between vitamin D intake and 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis.

RESULTS:

A total of 6294 subjects (1820 men and 4474 women) with a mean age of 42 years, were included. Of these, subjects in the highest quintile of vitamin D intake presented lower levels of triglycerides 14.6 mg/dL (P for trend = 0.001); 2.0 cm less in waist circumference (P for trend = 0.001) and 0.8 points less in the Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score (P for trend = 0.002) compared with the subjects in the lower quintile of vitamin D intake. Additionally, participants in the highest quintile of vitamin D consumption were less likely to develop elevated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, compared with those in the lowest quintile (OR = 0.51; 95%CI: 0.33, 0.77; P for trend = 0.007).

CONCLUSION:

Our data suggest that higher consumption of vitamin D is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease in Mexican population.
