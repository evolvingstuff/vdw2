#### [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-causes-a-person-to-be-imm-F4__PitKRxet7h_6sIUZ_Q) answer - Sept 2024

There are several factors that can cause a person to become immunocompromised:

1. Medical conditions:

> HIV/AIDS

> Cancer, especially cancers of the immune system like leukemia

> Diabetes

> Multiple myeloma

1. Genetic disorders:

> Primary immunodeficiency disorders like severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)

> Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)

> Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)

1. Medications and treatments:

> Chemotherapy for cancer

> Immunosuppressive drugs given after organ transplants

> Long-term use of corticosteroids

> Radiation therapy

1. Other factors:

> Advanced age

> Malnutrition, especially protein deficiency

> Lack of sleep

> Chronic stress

> Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption

1. Temporary causes:

> Recent infections like influenza or mononucleosis

> Prolonged hospitalization

1. Removal of immune system organs:

> Spleen removal (splenectomy)

Being immunocompromised means the immune system is weakened and less able to fight off infections and diseases. This can lead to more frequent, severe, or difficult-to-treat infections. The degree of immunocompromise can vary depending on the underlying cause and may be temporary or long-lasting.
