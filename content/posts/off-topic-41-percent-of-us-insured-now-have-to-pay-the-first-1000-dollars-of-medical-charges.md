### [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/upshot/with-sickest-patients-cost-sharing-comes-at-a-price.html?rref=upshot&abt=0002&abg=0)

*  **“The proportion of insured workers with at least a $1,000 deductible was 41 percent in 2014, quadruple that in 2006”** 

* A 2010 study found that  when “…cost sharing for physician visits and prescription drugs goes up, so does overall Medicare spending.”

> “For  **every dolla** r saved on doctor and drug spending, Medicare’s hospital spending increased by more than  **$6** .”

* “The way cost sharing is being applied today is too blunt. Charging sicker patients the same as healthy ones for the drugs and preventive care they need ultimately costs more.

* It’s not intuitive, but the studies show it’s true: Spending more on prevention — but only for the sickest patients — can save money down the road.”

* -And, many workers do not have medical insurance or do not have sick leave – and thus have strong economic reasons to come to work in restaurants, nursing homes, stores, while sick/infectious.

Note: Routine appointments often just have copays (no deductibles).
