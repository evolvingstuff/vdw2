We conducted a randomized clinical trial testing a Vitamin D-based intervention to improve Vitamin D status and reduce bone density decline. Poor adherence to home supplementation necessitated a change to directly observed therapy (DOT) with intermittent, high-dose Vitamin D3 randomized versus standard of care (SOC). Compared to SOC, DOT Vitamin D3 successfully increased trough Vitamin 25(OH)D levels (p = .026) with no residual Vitamin D deficiency, 100% adherence to DOT Vitamin D3, and without associated toxicity. However, neither Vitamin D status nor supplementation impacted bone density. Thus, this adherence-optimized intervention is feasible and effective to correct Vitamin D deficiency in adolescents during ALL therapy. Repletion of Vitamin D and calcium alone did not mitigate osteopenia, however, and new, comprehensive approaches are needed to address treatment-associated osteopenia during ALL therapy.</p><hr><h4 id=low-25oh-vitamin-d3-levels-are-associated-with-adverse-outcome-in-newly-diagnosed-intensively-treated-adult-acute-myeloid-leukemia>Low 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels are associated with adverse outcome in newly diagnosed, intensively treated adult acute myeloid leukemia</h4><p>Cancer. 25 OCT 2013, DOI: 10.1002/cncr.28368</p><p>Hun Ju Lee MD1,†, Josephia R.

A positive association for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma was noted only in those with a diagnosis made during the first 2 y of follow-up (P-heterogeneity = 0.03), which suggests the possibility of reverse causality. Further analysis restricted to participants with ≥2 y of follow-up time showed a significant association between 25(OH)D and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 161): adjusted incidence rate ratios were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.90; P-trend = 0.05) and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.76; P-trend = 0.03) for the top compared with the bottom season-standardized and season-specific quartiles, respectively.

We evaluated the relationship between 25(OH)D serum levels and time to first treatment (TFT), a disease-specific end point, in 130 previously untreated Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Measurement of 25(OH)D was performed by means of a direct, competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay using the DiaSorin LIAISON 25(OH)D TOTAL assay (DiaSorin, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota). Overall, 41 patients (31.5%) had severe vitamin D insufficiency (&lt;10 ng/mL), 66 (50.7%) had mild to moderate insufficiency (10-24 ng/mL), and 23 (17.6%) had 25(OH)D levels within the optimal range (25-80 ng/mL), with no relationship with between the season of sample collection and 25(OH)D level (P=0.188). A patient stratification according to these 3 groups led to significant difference in terms of TFT, with vitamin D insufficient patients having the shortest TFT (P=0.02). With respect to continuous 25(OH)D levels and clinical outcome, TFT was shorter as 25(OH)D decreased until a value of 13.5 ng/mL at which point the association of 25(OH)D and TFT remained constant. As a matter of fact, the 25(OH)D value of 13.5 ng/mL identified two patients subsets with different TFT risk (HR=1.91; 95% CI=1.06-3.44; P=0.03). In multivariate analysis the variable entering the model at a significant level were mutational status of IgVH (P&lt;0.0001), serum thymidine kinase (P=0.02) and absolute lymphocyte count (P=0.03). Thus confirming the Mayo clinic experience, our data provide further evidence that 25(OH)D levels may be an important host factor influencing TFT of Binet stage A patients. Whether normalizing vitamin D levels may delay disease-progression of patients with early disease will require testing in future trials.</p><hr><h4 id=chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia-responsive-to-vitamin-d-administration---2012>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia responsive to vitamin D administration - 2012</h4><p>Br J Haematol. 2012 Jan;156(1):148-9. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08828.x.>doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08828.x.</a> Epub 2011 Aug 25.</p><p>Arlet JB, Callens C, Hermine O, Darnige L, Macintyre E, Pouchot J, Capron L.</p><p>PMID: 21883139</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>No abstract – PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p><hr><h4 id=significant-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-deficiency-in-child-and-adolescent-survivors-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-treatment-with-chemotherapy-compared-with-allogeneic-stem-cell-transplant>Significant 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in child and adolescent survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: treatment with chemotherapy compared with allogeneic stem cell transplant.</h4><p>Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Jul 1;56(7):1114-9. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.22949>doi: 10.1002/pbc.22949</a></p><p>Simmons JH, Chow EJ, Koehler E, Esbenshade A, Smith LA, Sanders J, Friedman D.</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Vanderbilt Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. <a href=mailto:jill.h.simmons@vanderbilt.edu>jill.h.simmons@vanderbilt.edu</a></p><p>BACKGROUND: 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency is common in healthy children and adolescents. There have been limited studies of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D status of survivors of pediatric and adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p><p>PROCEDURE: In a cohort of 78 ALL survivors (52 chemotherapy-treated and 26 HCT-treated), we determined the prevalence of, and host, treatment and environmental risk factors for 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency.</p><p>RESULTS: There were no differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between ALL survivors treated with conventional chemotherapy and those treated with HCT (median 26.0 vs 25.5 ng/ml). Fifty-three percent of pediatric ALL survivors were 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficient (15-29 ng/dl), and 12% were deficient (&lt;15 ng/dl). Younger age, higher reported dietary vitamin D intake, use of vitamin D supplementation, and increased ambient ultraviolet light were associated with higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. There was not enough evidence to suggest treatment type, gender, race, years since diagnosis or BMI were associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Only 27% of conventional chemotherapy-treated ALL survivors and 8% of HCT-treated ALL survivors met RDA for dietary vitamin D intake.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in ALL survivors is similar to that of the general pediatric population in the United States, and there is no difference in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status between chemotherapy-treated and HCT-treated ALL survivors. ALL survivors rarely meet the RDA requirements for vitamin D. Further studies are needed to determine whether dietary and behavioral interventions can improve the vitamin D status of ALL survivors.</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-insufficiency-and-prognosis-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia---2011>Vitamin D insufficiency and prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia - 2011</h4><p>Blood. 2011 Feb 3;117(5):1492-8. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2010-07-295683>doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-295683</a></p><p>Shanafelt TD, Drake MT, Maurer MJ, Allmer C, Rabe KG, Slager SL, Weiner GJ, Call TG, Link BK, Zent CS, Kay NE, Hanson CA, Witzig TE, Cerhan JR.</p><p>Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.</p><p>Vitamin D insufficiency is common globally and low levels are linked to higher cancer incidence. Although vitamin D insufficiency is related to inferior prognosis in some cancers, no data exist for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). We evaluated the relationship of 25(OH)D serum levels with time-to-treatment (TTT) and overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed CLL patients participating in a prospective cohort study (discovery cohort) and a separate cohort of previously untreated patients participating in an observational study (confirmation cohort). Of 390 CLL patients in the discovery cohort, 119 (30.5%) were 25(OH)D insufficient. After a median follow-up of 3 years, TTT (hazard ratio<span>[HR]</span> = 1.66; P = .005) and OS (HR = 2.39; P = .01) were shorter for 25(OH)D-insufficient patients. In the validation cohort, 61 of 153 patients (39.9%) were 25(OH)D insufficient. After a median follow-up of 9.9 years, TTT (HR = 1.59; P = .05) and OS (HR 1.63; P = .06) were again shorter for 25(OH)D-insufficient patients. On pooled multivariable analysis of patients in both cohorts adjusting for age, sex, Rai stage, CD38 status, ZAP-70 status, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene mutation status, CD49d status, and cytogenetic abnormalities assessed by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization testing, 25(OH)D insufficiency remained an independent predictor of TTT (HR = 1.47; P = .008), although the association with OS was not significant (HR = 1.47; P = .07).
