Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is often associated with low serum 25(OH)D levels, as well as cognitive dysfunctions. The relationship between 25(OH)D and the most commonly affected cognitive domain in MS; processing speed, is poorly explored. The purpose of this study is to: (1) assess the effect of serum 25(OH)D change on processing speed in MS, and (2) explore the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and brain volume changes in MS. A retrospective chart review was conducted, data from 299 patients were extracted (baseline), of whom 163 had follow-up measurements (after at least a 9-month interval). The Symbol Digits Modalities Test (SDMT) was used as a measure of processing speed. MRI data was available from 78 individuals at baseline, and 70 at follow-up. SDMT scores and brain volumes (Cerebellum (total, grey, and white), intracranial, Grey Matter (GM), and White Matter (WM)) were compared based on 25(OH)D levels and their changes towards follow-up. 

Results indicated that patients with deficient 25(OH)D levels had lower SDMT scores when compared to those with sufficient levels, and SDMT scores improved as a function of 25(OH)D. For MRI measures, only patients with sufficient 25(OH)D levels during both assessment periods had significant changes in intracranial and total cerebellum volumes. 

We conclude that 25(OH)D levels seem to have an effect on processing speed in MS, thus the importance of clinical monitoring and supplementation in this regard is reinforced.
