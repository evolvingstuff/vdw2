* 2. Synthesis and Metabolism of Vitamin D. Rosen CJ. NEJM 2011;364:248 Vitamin D is initially generated in the skin from the nonenzymatic conversion of provitamin D3 to previtamin D3. Dietary intake of vitamin D is usually relatively limited, since few foods, with the exception of certain kinds of fish, contain sizable amounts; supplements are commonly used. Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) is either stored in adipose tissue or converted in the liver by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25<span>[OH]</span>D3) or calcidiol, the form that circulates in the highest concentration and reflects solar and dietary exposure. It is converted to the active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D), or calcitriol, in the kidney, although other tissues have 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) enzymatic activity. The synthesis of calcitriol is enhanced (+) by increasing levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which rise in response to lower levels of serum calcium. Reduced levels of serum phosphate can also increase (+) the production of calcitriol. Its synthesis is suppressed (–) by the production of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which is secreted by osteocytes in the bone matrix. Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) inhibits the activity of 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and stimulates the activity of 24-hydroxylase (CYP24R1), an enzyme that promotes production of 24,25(OH)2D3, a vitamin D product that is not biologically active. In CYP2R1, CYP27B1, and CYP24R1, CYP denotes cytochrome P. calcidiol

   * 1058 (52·8 % females) European adolescents (aged 12·5-17·5 years) from ten cities. •Lower vitamin D , vitamin C , and folate concentrations were observed in male and female breakfast skippers than in consumers (P<0·05). •Female breakfast consumers presented higher holo-transcobalamin and lower total homocysteine (P<0·05), while males had higher cobalamin (B12) concentrations, compared with skippers (P<0·05). •Female consumers had higher intakes of vitamin B6 and vitamin E than occasional consumers (P<0·05). Approximately one-quarter of circulating cobalamin (vitamin B-12) binds to transcobalamin (holoTC) and is thereby available for the cells of the body. For this reason, holoTC is also referred to as active vitamin B-12.

Rather IA, Front Microbiol. 2016 Apr 12;7:507. •The effects of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of AD remain elusive. •However, evidence from different research groups show that probiotics could have positive effect on AD treatment, if any, that depend on multiple factors, such as specific probiotic strains, time of administration (onset time), duration of exposure, and dosage. Proposed mechanism of probiotics in an animal model of AD. Exposure of atopic skin to a potential allergen enhances the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) that is known to activate dendritic cells (DC). Stimulated dendritic cell direct differentiation of naïveT-cell intoTh2 cells and Th17 cells which, are known as the mediators of allergic inflammation in skin. Probiotics could inhibit the allergic inflammation by increasing the population of regulatoryTcells (Tregs) in the mesenteric lymphnodes of patients. TheseTregs could migrate to the site of inflammation and suppress theTh2 and Th17 mediated allergic response or directly reduce the expression of TSLP.

Vitamin D is metabolized into a seco-steroid (a type of steroid with a "broken" ring) hormone that regulates about 3% of the 26,000 genes in the coding human genome. It is also a neurosteroid that is active in brain development, having effects on cellular proliferation, differentiation, calcium signaling, neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions; it also appears to have effect on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.

Conclusions Vitamin D is a hormone with genomic effects that are involved in fetal development and immune function maturation. As observed with all hormones both low and high levels are dangerous, but only 1/3 of people is VitD sufficient. There is accumulating evidence that appropriate levels of vitamin D (30-40 ng/mL) are useful for the primary prevention of allergic and autoimmune diseases development. Supplementation of vitamin D improves control of allergic/autoimmune diseaes and are necessary in all persons and not only in infancy. Supplementation of vitamin D associated with probiotics, other nutraceuticals might be more efficacious but further study are necessary.

   * Serum 25(OH)D ≥50 nmol/L were considered optimal. •In the participants aged 40-59 y, an increment in serum 25(OH)D of 10 nmol/L was associated with a 0.03- ± 0.01-kbp longer LTL, (P = 0.001). •In the same age group, 25(OH)D concentrations ≥50 nmol/L were associated with a 0.13- ± 0.04-kbp longer LTL than those for 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nmol/L (P = 0.01).
