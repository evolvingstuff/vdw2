#### Benefits of using a microencapsulated vitamin D delivery system in women with polycystic ovary syndrome

Eur J Hosp Pharm. 2021 Dec 1;ejhpharm-2021-002967. [doi: 10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002967](https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002967) [Paywall](https://ejhp.bmj.com/content/early/2021/11/30/ejhpharm-2021-002967)

Objective: To compare and assess the efficacy of two vitamin D delivery systems (oil-based and microencapsulated) on 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance (IR) in women with established polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and vitamin D deficiency.

Materials and methods: A monocentric, retrospective study was conducted, using the data of 70 female patients, who visited the endocrinology department of the "Dr. Shterev" Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria between May 2020 and September 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of vitamin D3 supplementation: either a microencapsulated liposomal form (n=35), or a conventional oil-based form (n=35). The following clinical measures were analysed and compared: BMI, serum levels of 25(OH)D, fasting plasma glucose levels, fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI), homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, levels of antimullerian hormone (AMH) II generation, and testosterone. In all selected patients, these measurements were performed at baseline and 3 months after initiation of vitamin D supplementation.

Results: Significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D were observed in patients supplemented with the microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 in the third month from the beginning of therapy, compared with the control group (p=0.003). In the microencapsulated vitamin D group, there was a decrease in IRI serum levels (p=0.023), HOMA-IR (p=0.021), serum AMH (p=0.010) and testosterone levels (p=0.006). The fasting plasma glucose levels did not change significantly.

Conclusion: The results of our study show that the patients supplemented with a microencapsulated form of vitamin D3 achieved faster compensation of 25(OH)D levels, which in turn, under equal conditions, led to significant improvement in the metabolic profile, in particular insulin sensitivity.
