**FACT:**  People with Rheumatoid arthritis are often vitamin D deficient

 **REPORT:**  People with the most Rheumatoid arthritis pain are the most vitamin D deficient

 **FACT:**  Rheumatoid arthritis pain is reduced by vitamin D - sometimes as little as 500 IU

 **FACT:** 24 % more likely to get RA if have consume a low amount of vitamin D

#### RA people who had Methotrexate Therapy  were 28% less likely to die if previously >20 ng of Vitamin D - Jan 2024

 **Higher Vitamin D Levels before Methotrexate Therapy Initiation Are Associated with Lower Subsequent Mortality in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis** 

Nutrients 2024 Jan 30;16(3):401. [doi: 10.3390/nu16030401](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16030401)

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with mortality in the general population and has been observed in one rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohort. Here, we investigate the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels before methotrexate (MTX) therapy initiation in patients with RA and the subsequent all-cause mortality in a national Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort. (2) This is a retrospective study on RA patients time-oriented around the initial MTX prescription and 25(OH)D levels before starting MTX. We examined survival in patients with 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L and ≤50 nmol/L using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model and fully adjusted for risk factors. (3) In total, 15,109 RA patients were included in the nationwide cohort. RA patients with 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L before starting MTX had a  **28% reduced risk of mortality**  when compared to those with levels ≤ 50 nmol/L (HR: 0.72, CI: 0.64-0.80, p < 0.001) after adjusting for traditional risk factors. (4) In this national RA cohort receiving standard-of-care MTX, patients with 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L have a lower subsequent mortality when compared to those with 25(OH)D levels ≤ 50 nmol/L. It remains to be determined whether increasing Vitamin D levels in RA patients initially found to be Vitamin D deficient impacts their all-cause mortality.

Hi everybody I am a french patient (who lives in Italy) with my daughter (12 years old) of the doctor Giordo, for our arthritis, we follow the Coimbra protocol since September 2017, and we already noticed great results!

My daughter from 4 months does not need anymore to take methotrexate for the first time!!! She took it since she was 4 years old...and each time doctors said us to remove it after 2 months her arthritis came back with pain and inflammation...

I wrote to Cicero Coimbra to thank him and I told him I want to share my testimony to the french people who don't know his protocol!! and he kindly answered me the day after, glad I want to share his protocol in my country (I don't know why there is no french doctors who follow the coimbra protocol and no french group FB so I thought to create the first FB GROUP for french people in a FRENCH LANGUAGE!) >> "Protocole du Dr.Cicero G.Coimbra (vit D hautes doses) France" (if you want the link I can send you on messenger! Write me here or send me a PM)

I hope there are FRENCH PEOPLE in this group who are reading me, maybe they want to sign up in the french group where I am the administrator and bring us their testimonies in french language, it would be fantastic!

I NEED THE TESTIMONIES TO FRENCH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND IN FRANCE!
