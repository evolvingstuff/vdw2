English SUMMARY

The Italian Society for Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism and Bone Diseases (SIOMMMS) has elaborated

the following guidelines about the definition, prevention and treatment of inadequate vitamin D status. The

highlights are presented here.

• Daily vitamin D allowance ranges from 1,500 IU (healthy adults) to 2,300 IU (elderly with low calcium

intake). Since the average Italian diet includes around 300 IU/day, subjects with no effective sun exposure

should be supplemented with 1,200-2,000 IU vitamin D per day.

• The serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels represents the most accurate way to assess vitamin D

repletion, even though there are still no standardized assay methods.

• Conditions of “deficiency” and “insufficiency” are defined by the following ranges of 25(OH)D levels: less

than 20 ng/ml and 20-30 ng/ml, respectively.

• In Italy, approximately 50% of young healthy subjects have vitamin D insufficiency during the winter months.

The prevalence of deficiency increases with ageing, affecting almost all elderly subjects not on vitamin D

supplements.

•  **When a condition of deficiency has been identified, a cumulative dose of 300,000-1,000,000 IU, over 1-4 weeks is recommended** .

• In subjects recently treated for deficiency-insufficiency, a maintenance dose of 800-2,000 IU/day (or weekly

equivalent) is recommended. In patients on daily doses over 1,000 IU, 25(OH)D levels should be checked

regularly (e.g. once every two years).

• The highest tolerated daily dose has been identified as 4,000 IU/day.

• Vitamin D supplementation should be carefully monitored in patients at higher risk of vitamin D intoxication

(granulomatosis) or with primary hyperparathyroidism.

• In pregnant women, vitamin D supplements should be given as in non-pregnant women, but bolus administration (i.e.: single dose >25,000 IU) should be avoided.
