#### Muscular Dystrophy treated by high-dose Coimbra Protocol (Facebook Aug 2019)

 **[Facebooktranslated](https://www.facebook.com/protocolocoimbrabrasil/photos/a.355234424634473/1346608032163769/?type=3&theater&ifg=1)** 

" hi good people!

I almost don't enter facebook anymore, but as I started to report on the treatment with vitamin D (Coimbra Protocol), for muscular dystrophy, I couldn't help but report the results of the

I've been doing this treatment for EXACTLY 7 months, and as reported before, some enzymes in my body (CPK) were high, causing my muscles to become inflamed, consequently losing strength (this is the process of the disease)

But yesterday I got the results of the exams I did end of July, and guess

Below are the words of my doctor (Dr. Lucia Schaedler):

"your cpk and dhl that are muscle enzymes, are practically normal, indicating that thank god the inflammatory activity of your disease is stopped"  

Imagine, lose strength for 17 years and receive such a news, that the disease is stabilized   

Only God knows how happy I am with this, and I wanted to share with you this news, that were people who gave me so many words of support and love since I decided to report about this disease I

PS. With The Disease Stabilized, it does not mean that I will have the muscle strength I had before, and yes that I will not continue to lose, now is to do the next step: Physiotherapy to keep the muscles I have, and continue with the treatment But as for God, nothing is impossible, I will not stop believing that one day I can make my moves again

#### Fracture in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Natural History and Vitamin D Deficiency – 2016

J Child Neurol. 2016 Aug;31(9):1181-7. [doi: 10.1177/0883073816650034](https://doi.org/10.1177/0883073816650034)

The present study examined the natural history of fracture and vitamin D levels in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, who are vulnerable to osteoporosis and fractures. Retrospective analysis of a cohort of 48 Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients revealed that 43% of patients experienced ≥1 fracture. Fracture probabilities at ages 6, 9, 12, and 15 years were 4%, 9%, 31%, and 60% respectively, accelerating around the time of ambulation loss (mean age 11.8 ± 2.7 years). Chronic corticosteroid therapy was utilized in 69% of patients and was associated with all vertebral fractures. A history of vitamin D deficiency occurred in 84%, and 35% were currently deficient. Despite chronic vitamin D supplementation, 38% remained deficient. These results demonstrate that osteoporosis and fracture remain major concerns in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Bone health should be optimized well before loss of ambulation, however current levels of vitamin D supplementation may be inadequate given high levels of deficiency.

#### People with DMD need more Vitamin D - meta-analysis Oct 2023

 **A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy** 

Neuromuscular Disorders https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2023.10.008

 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is prevalent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy

* We looked at the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation across multiple studies

* Current doses prevent severe deficiency but are not as effective as intended

* No significant link between supplement dose and serum vitamin D levels was found

* About 20% of people with Duchenne taking vitamin D supplements are still deficient

We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in maintaining or restoring vitamin D levels in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Due to a lack of randomised controlled trials, cross-sectional and retrospective and prospective cohort studies were taken as the best available evidence. Inclusion criteria included reporting mean serum vitamin D levels in a supplement-taking group. After screening 102 records; 13 were included in a narrative synthesis and eight of these in a meta-analysis. 

We show that current dosing regimens are preventing severe deficiency but are not effective at maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels within the Duchenne population. 

Despite high levels of daily vitamin D supplementation (>1000 International Units), at least 20% of people with Duchenne remain vitamin D deficient. 

No significant association between dose and serum vitamin D levels was found (r2 = 0.3, p = 0.237). A meta-analysis of mean serum vitamin D levels across eight studies also revealed substantial variability in response to vitamin D supplementation and high heterogeneity (I2 = 99.59 %). These data could impact on an individual's risk and severity of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures.

#### Need 3X more vitamin D if DMD - 2019

 **Increased Rates of Vitamin D Insufficiency in Boys With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Despite Higher Vitamin D3 Supplementation – 2019** 

Glob Pediatr Health. 2019 Mar 15;6:2333794X19835661. [doi: 10.1177/2333794X19835661](https://doi.org/10.1177/2333794X19835661)

Vitamin D supplementation is important for many chronic pediatric conditions to help maintain bone health; however, there is little evidence about how disease-related factors affect vitamin D status. The objective was to compare 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in 3 pediatric cohorts (Duchenne muscular dystrophy <span>[DMD]</span>, systemic lupus erythematosus <span>[SLE]</span>, and osteogenesis imperfecta <span>[OI]</span>). In a retrospective study of 367 subjects, children with DMD had increased prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (25% vs 14% <span>[SLE]</span> and 10% <span>[OI]</span>, P = .002), despite higher vitamin D3 supplementation doses. Boys with DMD also had higher weight, fat mass, and lower lean mass percentage Z scores. DMD was associated with having higher rates of vitamin D insufficiency than other comparable pediatric chronic disease cohorts, the effect of which may be modulated by clinical factors such as increased adiposity. While corroboration of these results is needed given baseline differences between the patient groups, greater vitamin D supplementation doses may be required to achieve optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations in boys with DMD.

#### Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy - perhaps caused by a poor gene - a treatment in 2023

The enzyme is known as HMG-CoA reductase halts cholesterol production

Dysfunction in this enzyme causes muscle weakness from both limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and statins.

#### Muscular Dystrophy and genes

 **[MD and genes](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy/)** 

 **Reduced response to Vitamin D is often due to poor vitamin D genes, such as:  
CYP27A1, CYP2R1 or VDBP  
Possibly: Poor Genes ==> Low Vitamin D ==> muscular dystrophy  
Unaware of if genes can be changed  
The solution might be just give 2X more vitamin D - similar to obese** 

 **Sometimes a reduced response to Vitamin D is due to a drug being taken to treat a disease** 

Wonder if a child with poor MD genes would be less likely to get MD if they had lots of Vitamin D

 **[MD describes a set of 30+ similar problems due to poor inherited genes - WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_dystrophy)** 

* "The word "dystrophy" comes from the Greek dys, meaning "no, un-" and troph- meaning "nourish""
