Background: This study evaluates the effect of vitamin D status in patient outcomes after hip or knee joint surgery. 

Method: Literature search was carried out in electronic databases, and study selection followed predetermined eligibility criteria. Data were extracted from relevant studies and meta-analyses of standardized mean differences between hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency) and euvitaminosis D in assessment scores of patient-reported outcomes were performed. 

Results: A total of 12 studies (2,593 patients; age 69.89 years <span>[95% CI 68.07–71.70]</span>; 35.95% <span>[29.43–42.46]</span> males) were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency) was 33.18% <span>[25.10–41.26]</span>, but the combined prevalence of deficiency and insufficiency was 46.99 <span>[34.02–59.96]</span>. 

Hospital stay was 1.09 days <span>[–0.39 to 2.56]</span> longer in the hypovitaminosis D group compared to the euvitaminosis D group. 

Preoperatively, Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Knee Society Score were significantly lower (p = 0.001 and p = 0.00001, respectively) in the hypovitaminosis D group than in the euvitaminosis D group. 

Postoperatively, HHS (p = 0.004) score was significantly lower in the hypovitaminosis D group than in the euvitaminosis D group. 

Conclusion: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is high in osteoarthritis patients undergoing knee or hip surgery. Vitamin D deficiency may affect the outcomes of orthopedic joint surgery. However, randomized trial/s will be required to confirm these findings.
