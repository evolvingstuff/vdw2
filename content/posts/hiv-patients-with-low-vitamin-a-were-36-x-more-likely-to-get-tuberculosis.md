Background

Although previous studies have shown that vitamin A deficiency is associated with incident tuberculosis (TB) disease, the direction of the association has not been established. We investigated the impact of vitamin A deficiency on TB disease progression.

Methods

We conducted a longitudinal cohort study nested within a randomized clinical trial among HIV-infected patients in Haiti. We compared serial vitamin A levels in individuals who developed TB disease to controls matched on age, gender, follow-up time, and time to antiretroviral therapy initiation. We also evaluated histopathology, bacterial load, and immune outcomes in TB infection in a guinea pig model of dietary vitamin A deficiency.

Results

Among 773 participants, 96 developed incident TB during follow-up, 62.5% (60) of whom had stored serum samples obtained 90–365 days before TB diagnosis. In age- and sex- adjusted and multivariate analyses, respectively, incident TB cases were 3.99 times (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 2.41 to 6.60) and 3.59 times (95% CI, 2.05 to 6.29) more likely to have been vitamin A deficient than matched controls. Vitamin A–deficient guinea pigs manifested more extensive pulmonary pathology, atypical granuloma morphology, and increased bacterial growth after experimental TB infection. Reintroduction of dietary vitamin A to deficient guinea pigs after established TB disease successfully abrogated severe disease manifestations and altered cellular immune profiles.

Conclusions

Human and animal studies support the role of baseline vitamin A deficiency as a determinant of future TB disease progression.
