Seasonal average for all 10 year olds was 25 nanograms

Apparently vitamin D levels were not measured at age 15, just academic performance

Paper does not appear to indicate the criteria for establishing that there was no relationship between vitamin D and intelligence: 

## Possibilities for a standard study would typically have included one of the following

* assigning kids to 4 vitamin D ranges – say 0-9 ng, 10-19 ng, 20-29 ng, and >30 ng

* assigning kids into two categories: above and below some amount – say 20 ng

## This study used NO ranges/categories

## This study did not even measure vitamin D levels at age 15.

## The study attempted to predict how much higher the vitamin D levels would be at age 15

## based on patents estimates of how long the kids were out of doors at age 9

## The lack of criteria  or vitamin D measurements at the time of the academic test

## did not stop the web from drawing invalid conclusions

## Titles of articles based on this paper indicate that the reporters have little understanding of science
