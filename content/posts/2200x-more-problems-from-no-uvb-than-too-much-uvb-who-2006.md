##### optimal = Not too much and not to little UVB

### Summary: Daily Adjusted Life Years

If could get less UVB -  **1.5 million DALYs**  could have been avoided

If get no UVB  **3,304 million DALYs**  would have been lost due to vitamin D deficiency diseases â€“ rickets, osteomalacia and osteoporosis. 

###  **<span style="color:#F00;">= 2200X more disability if have no UVB than if have too much UVB</span>** 

### What the above chart should look like using the WHO data

{IMG(attId="1642" max = "350")}{IMG}

Figure 2.1 Schematic diagram of the relation between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and the burden of disease

A = Vitamin D insufficiency 

B = Optimal 

C= Skin cancers, eye disease

Horizontal line = Personal exposure to UVR relative to skin type

### Caption

Points A and C represent inappropriate UVR exposure. Fair-skinned populations in Australia with high outdoor UVR exposure typify point A. 

Point C represents people with insufficient UVR exposure, whose dietary vitamin D intake will also be important in determining their vitamin D status. 

Point B represents optimal UVR exposure: a person with careful titration of correct UVR dose for skin type.

### Diseases with increasing incidence where UVR exposure/vitamin D is inadequate:

 **Autoimmune diseases** : Multiple sclerosis Type 1 diabetes Rheumatoid arthritis

 **Cancers** : Prostate Breast cancre Colorectal cancer Ovary cancer Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

 **Psychiatric disorders** : Seasonal affective disorder Mood disorders Schizophrenia

### Diseases with increasing incidence where UVR exposure is excessive

Acute macular degeneration 

Posterior subcapsular cataract 

Nuclear cataract 

Ocular melanoma

### Diseases CAUSED by UVB = too much

#### The WHO paper states that the 2200X did not even consider DALYs due to

cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, ovary and others; 

autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis; 

cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, acute stroke and coronary artery disease; 

endocrine disorders such as type 2 diabetes; 

psychiatric disorders and disorders of mood; 

lymphomas including both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
