In a new study, researchers at the Faculty of Medicine and Moores UCSD Cancer Center is a complex computer model for predicting dietary intake of vitamin D3 and calcium to prevent 58 000 new cases of breast cancer and use the 49,000 new cases of cancer each year in the United States and Canada. The research model also predicted that 75% of deaths from these cancers prevented by adequate intake of vitamin D3 and calcium could.
