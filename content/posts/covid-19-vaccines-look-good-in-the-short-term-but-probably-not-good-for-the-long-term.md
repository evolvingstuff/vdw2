**Short term individual:**  Vaccine reduces risks of  COVID-19

 **Long-term Individual:**  Will likely require booster shots or new vaccines to fight variants

* Note: The Influenza vaccine needs annual updates and is rarely even 70% effective

* Note: No vaccine has ever had much long-term success with viruses that mutate

* Note: Measles vaccine is successful, but measles does not mutate

 **Long-term society:**  Herd immunity seems to be an impossible goal in most locations

* 1) Too many people are hesitant to take emergency-use vaccines

* 2) No vaccine yet developed for 24% of the population (i.e. children)

* 3) No vaccine has ever been able to successfully fight a virus that mutates

 **Unknowns as of April 2021:**  More data should be available in the summer

* 1) Possible long-term side effects of vaccines

* 2) Ability of a vaccine to fight new variants - such as current Double Mutation outbreak in India

* 3) COVID-19 mutations so far do not appear to be a result of vaccines, however that may change

 **Conclusion:** Take a vaccine if you must, but wait for a few months if possible

* As of April, vaccines appear to be significantly safer than COVID-19

 **Suggestion:** Consider fortifying your immune system quickly with vitamin D (with or without the vaccine)

* 1) A fortified immune system [enhances the ability of a vaccine to fight a virus](/tags/enhances-the-ability-of-a-vaccine-to-fight-a-virus.html)

* 2) A fortified immune system is able to try out [1 quadrillion unique antibodies](/tags/1-quadrillion-unique-antibodies.html)

* 3) A fortified immune system appears to defend the body against a virtually infinite variety of invaders,

   * Example - [Vitamin D fights all enveloped viruses](/tags/vitamin-d-fights-all-enveloped-viruses.html)

   * Enveloped virus include all 5 of previously known coronaviruses, as well as Cold sore, Shingles, Epstein-Barr, 

      * Hepatitis B, HIV, Dengue, Yellow fever, Measles, Mumps, Smallpox,...
