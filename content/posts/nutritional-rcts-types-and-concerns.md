#### Abstract

Nutrition is an essential component when promoting human health. Without a doubt, improving the quality of one's diet can improve one's quality of life as a whole and help postpone the onset or control of many chronic diseases. The volume of publications in this field has increased in recent years, in line with increased awareness of the importance of nutrition in health; however, the quality of the evidence on which most nutritional guidelines are based remains low, due to errors in conducting nutritional interventions or because the information is primarily derived from observational studies. To enhance the evidence supporting clinical guidelines in nutrition, the quality of randomized clinical trials (RCT) based on nutritional interventions must be improved; nevertheless, due to their heterogeneous nature and a lack of specific guidelines for designing, performing, documenting, and reporting on this type of intervention, conducting a nutritional intervention is a real challenge. Following a review of the literature on the methodological and ethical standards, as well as four extensions of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines that should be considered when implementing a nutritional intervention, seven essential aspects were identified. The current narrative review includes definitions, examples, diagrams, and algorithms regarding aspects of the appropriate study design, the intervention of the control group, the randomization and blinding processes, the study population selection, as well as a description of the type of intervention and the personnel involved in carrying out the study in order to make the implementation of a nutritional intervention easier.

#### Introduction

Nutrition is a critical component when promoting human health; it is now regarded as a determining factor in the prevention and treatment of many non-communicable dis-eases. Despite the importance of nutrition in health and the fact that information in this field has increased in volume in recent years, the quality of the evidence on which nutritional guidelines are based is questionable, since the majority of nutrition evidence is based on the findings of observational studies. Furthermore, when the data comes from randomized clinical trials (RCT) based on nutritional interventions, the results are frequently debatable or of little clinical significance due to design limitations <sup>[1]</sup>.

Only 26% of clinical recommendations made by nutrition professionals are currently classified as level I evidence, with the remaining 74% classified as levels II and III. RCTs are an important pillar of evidence in the field of health. Therefore, improving the quality of nutritional interventions is necessary to improve the evidence quality of nutritional recommendations <sup>[2,3]</sup>.

A nutritional intervention is a set of actions designed to change a nutritional aspect in an individual or a population. Nutritional intervention involves a wide range of activities, from nutrient administration to the implementation of a nutritional education program <sup>[4]</sup>. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies nutritional interventions into four types:

1. Behavioral interventions, which aim to modify eating habits by changing them.

1. Fortification, which is the addition of nutrients to basic foods.

1. Supplementation, which entails administering a specific nutrient to a specific population.

1. Regulatory interventions, the goal of which is to regulate certain activities in order to modify nutrition and improve health <sup>[5]</sup>.

A RCT, regardless of the type of intervention, is essentially a research design that must meet two requirements: the manipulation of a variable (the independent variable), and the random allocation of the intervention between study groups <sup>[6]</sup>. In addition to these two fundamental aspects, a set of guidelines has been established that must be considered in RCT reports, with the goal of ensuring the quality of the research and providing sufficient evidence to make well-informed health-care decisions <sup>[7,8]</sup>.

Improperly conducting a RCT can significantly reduce the value of the results and the usefulness of an investigation, resulting in time and money being wasted, in addition to the risks to which the study participants may be exposed. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and many peer-reviewed journals have adopted the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) criteria to help improve the quality of RCTs and their reports <sup>[9]</sup>.

The CONSORT guidelines were published for the first time in 1996; initially, they only considered clinical trials based on pharmacological treatments. However, after an analysis of the RCTs published up to that point, it was discovered that non-pharmacological therapies accounted for one out of every four publications in 2000. This highlighted the need for updates to improve the quality of non-pharmacological RCT methodology and final reports <sup>[7,8]</sup>.

In general, four CONSORT extensions can be extremely beneficial in the development of nutritional interventions. "Non-Pharmacologic Treatment Interventions" is a useful addition to most nutritional interventions. If the intervention involves the consumption of an herbal compound or a nutritional supplement containing herbs, the extension "Controlled Trials of Herbal Interventions" should be considered. Furthermore, depending on the chosen design and the research objective, the "Non-Inferiority and Equivalence Trials" extension may be useful, for example, in the case of a parallel design in which the efficacy of one nutritional intervention is compared to another or a pharmacological therapy is compared to a nutritional intervention. Finally, the "Cluster Trials" extension will be useful when the intervention is aimed at groups <span>[7,10-12]</span>.

Despite updates and extensions to the CONSORT guidelines that may be useful in nutritional interventions, there is no specific guide that takes into account the needs of a RCT based on a nutritional intervention as a whole. The lack of a guideline that incorporates the characteristics that nutritional interventions must meet raises the possibility of bias in the methodology or in the reports, reducing the certainty of the results when they are evaluated using tools such as GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) or equivalents <sup>[13]</sup>.

As a result, the goal of this narrative review is to discuss the critical methodological aspects that must be considered when conducting a RCT based on a nutritional intervention. This is to ensure the validity of the results, taking into account the guidelines that they share with the applicable CONSORT criteria and reports that highlight identified weaknesses in nutritional interventions. In general, it includes the following aspects: a proper study design selection, an intervention of the control group, randomization and blinding processes, study population selection, as well as description of the type of intervention and personnel involved in carrying it out.

#### Methods—Literature Search Strategy

The current narrative review was conducted in three steps, the first of which was a literature search using the MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Articles published between 2000 and January 2021 were included. The search terms used were: [consume of lot of polysaturated fats](/tags/consume-of-lot-of-polysaturated-fats.html), many inflammations, most Chemotherapies

   * Or, should those people be excluded from the trial

#### Should a child's dose size be proportional to age?

* e.g. 1,000 IU for all ages, or perhaps 

#### How to ensure that participants remain blinded

* Those getting Vitamin D may feel much better in many ways in a month or so

* Those not feeling better may secretly take Vitamin D, which is available anywhere

#### How to ensure that participants all take the vitamin D at the best time
