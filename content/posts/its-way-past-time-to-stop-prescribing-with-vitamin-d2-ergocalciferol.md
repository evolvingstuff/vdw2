#### IT'S TIME TO STOP PRESCRIBING ERGOCALCIFEROL.

Endocr Pract. 2018 Oct 5. [doi: 10.4158/EP-2018-0415.](https://doi.org/10.4158/EP-2018-0415.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Binkley NC1,2, Wiebe DA1,3.

 **Abstract is behind a paywall** 

#### Summary of points from the study

* Unsure how much vitamin D is needed > 15ng, >20ng, >30ng  (does not mention >40 ng)

* Large variability between vitamin D test results (Probably true for both D3 and D2))

* Most people have small amounts of D2 vs D3 (except indoor vegans?)

* D2 provides less response than D3

#### Additional studies on reasons to not use D2 - from VitaminDWiki

* [Overview Vitamin D3 not D2](/posts/overview-vitamin-d3-not-d2)

* [Loading dose of Vitamin D2 REDUCED vitamin D blood in a third of the patients – Jan 2015](/posts/loading-dose-of-vitamin-d2-reduced-vitamin-d-blood-in-a-third-of-the-patients) many studies have sound similar results

* [D2 may reduce academic performance – Dec 2012](/posts/d2-may-reduce-academic-performance)

 **D2 was found first, is far more expensive, is only available via prescription, is only available in a few forms and sizes** 

#### D2 still being prescribed in many places

* [372 types of vitamin D prescriptions in France, 200,000 IU was the most popular – Oct 2013](/posts/372-types-of-vitamin-d-prescriptions-in-france-200000-iu-was-the-most-popular)

* [PDR still lists ergocalciferol in 2018](http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/Drisdol-ergocalciferol-1904) "dietary source of Vitamin D"

> It contains all of the information normally associated with just Vitamin D3, but "D3" does not occur once in the long article

> along with many errors - such as "...vitamin D can increase serum magnesium concentrations"

> "Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2) is classified as FDA pregnancy risk category C"

> "Maximal clinical effects of a given dosage are usually observed in 4 weeks. "  Nope - 12 to 25 weeks
