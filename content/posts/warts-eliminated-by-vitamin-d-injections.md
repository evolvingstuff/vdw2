INTRODUCTION: warts are common viral infection of the skin, usually treated with destructive methods like electrocautery, Cryotherapy or laser ablation. Topical vitamin D has been used to treat warts with variable success AIM OF THE WORK: is to evaluate the efficacy of intralesional vitamin D3 injection in the treatment of common warts.

PATIENTS AND METHOD:

fifty patients were divided into two groups: thirty patient as cases group who received intralesional injection of 0.2 ml of vitamin D3 (300.000 IU) into the base of mother wart for two sessions and another twenty patients as a control group who were injected with normal saline solution. Standardized photographs were taken before, one month and three months after the procedure. The degree of the response was classified into complete, partial and no response.

RESULT: complete clearance of the target injected warts occurred in 40% of patients in cases group while it occurred only in 5% of patients in control group (P≤0.001) that was statistically significant.

CONCLUSION: intralesional injection of vitamin D3 may be considered a good and safe modality for the treatment of common warts.

60,000 IU Injection, 1 or two times

Injections are probably not required for skin problems

Topical Vitamin D seems to work as well - see study at the bottom of this page

 **Subsequent study in the same journal, different authors**

BACKGROUND:

Plantar warts are typically resistant to treatment. In recent years, treatments have included administration of intralesional tuberculin; measles, mumps, rubella vaccine; and Candida albicans antigen immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of intralesional vitamin D administration for the treatment of warts.

AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional vitamin D treatment for plantar warts.

METHODS: Twenty patients with single or multiple plantar warts were included in this study. Vitamin D3 (0.2 mL, 7.5 mg/mL) was injected into the base of the warts after prilocaine (0.1 mL, 20 mg/mL) injection. A maximum of 5 warts were treated in 1 session, with at maximum 2 injections performed at 4-week intervals.

RESULTS: In total, 16 of 20 patients (80%) showed complete resolution of warts, and 1 patient showed partial resolution. Three patients failed to show any response. No recurrence or serious adverse effects were observed.

CONCLUSION: Intralesional vitamin D3 may be an effective treatment option for warts.

#### Successful Treatment of Anogenital Wart with a Topical Vitamin D(3) Derivative in an Infant.- 2010

Case Rep Dermatol. 2010 Apr 20;2(1):46-49.

Anogenital warts are an infectious disorder of the anogenital lesion caused by one or more human papilloma viruses. 

Verruca is commonly treated with freezing with liquid nitrogen, laser therapy or application of imiquimod. 

Such ablative treatment may cause pain and scars on the anogenital lesion. 

We herein report an infant case of anogenital wart which was successfully treated with a topical vitamin D(3) derivative. 

Topical application of a vitamin D(3) derivative may be an alternative therapy for anogenital warts in infants.
