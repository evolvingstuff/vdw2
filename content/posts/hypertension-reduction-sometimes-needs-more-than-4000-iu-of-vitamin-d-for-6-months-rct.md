 **Options for reduction in hypertension include** 

1. Loading dose - to get good level of vitamin D in days, not months (see chart below)

1. Use more than 4,000 IU

1. Run trial for longer than 6 months

Background—A large body of epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may promote hypertension. This raises the possibility that vitamin D supplementation could be a simple intervention to reduce blood pressure, but data from prospective, randomized trials are limited.

Methods and Results—A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at 4 sites in the United States. We enrolled 534 individuals aged 18 to 50 years with low vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≤ 25 ng/ml) and systolic blood pressure 120-159 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to high-dose (4,000 IU/day) versus low-dose (400 IU/day) oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. The primary endpoint was change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Secondary endpoints included change in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure and clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The median age was 38 years, and 62% of participants were men. Forty-six percent of participants were white, and 48% were black. The median 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 15.3 ng/ml. Four-hundred fifty-five participants (85%) had at least one follow-up blood pressure measurement; 383 participants (72%) completed the full, 6-month study. At the end of the study, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure, -0.8 mm Hg versus -1.6 mm Hg in the high-dose and low-dose arms, p=0.71) or in any of the secondary endpoints. Further, there was no evidence of association between change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure at 6 months (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.05, p=0.34). Results were consistent across pre-specified subgroups.

Conclusions—Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce blood pressure in individuals with pre- or stage I hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. Our findings suggest that the association between vitamin D status and elevated blood pressure noted in observational studies is not causal.

Introduction. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the onset and progression of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, mechanisms underlying vitamin D deficiency-mediated increased risk of CVD remain unknown. We sought to examine the differential effect of high-dose versus low-dose vitamin D supplementation on markers of arterial stiffness among ~40 vitamin D deficient adults with prehypertension. 

Methods. Participants were randomized to high-dose (4000 IU/d) versus low-dose (400 IU/d) oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure (BP), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and pulse wave analyses were obtained at baseline and after 6 months of vitamin D supplementation. 

Results. There were no changes in resting BP or pulse wave velocity over 6 mo regardless of vitamin D dose (all p > 0.202). High-dose vitamin D decreased augmentation index and pressure by 12.3 ± 5.3% (p = 0.047) and 4.0 ± 1.5 mmHg (p = 0.02), respectively. However, these decreases in arterial stiffness were not associated with increases in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D over 6 mo (p = 0.425). 

Conclusion. High-dose vitamin D supplementation appears to lower surrogate measures of arterial stiffness but not indices of central pulse wave velocity. Clinical Trial Registration. This trial is registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (Unique Identifier: NCT01240512).
