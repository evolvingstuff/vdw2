1) Download the PDF file to your computer

2) Go to [Google Translate Documents](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=es&op=docs)

3) Find the PDF file on your computer(Must be shorter than 10MB as of July 2021)

4) Select the language to translate to

5) Click on TRANSLATE 

Google does a pretty good job.

Occasionally the translated line is longer than original, so the lines in 2 columns will overlap

The result is difficult to read on small screens (smartphone)
