## Highlights of 80 minute video  from India Spring 2012 (unable to find link in July)

### &nbsp; &nbsp;[CLICK HERE to see video uploaded to a Public DropBox](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7721630/Holick%20India%20Spring%202012.flv)

* [Schizophrenia](/tags/schizophrenia.html) is one of the many diseases Dr. Holick believes can be prevented with vitamin D

* [Vitamin D test](/tags/vitamin-d-test.html) is the most ordered blood test in the US {2011?}

* Is your infant vitamin D deficient? Best symptom =  head sweating at night

> Note: there are many other [possible causes for head sweating](http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/symptoms/night_sweats_in_children/causes.htm)

* 750,000 pet reptiles purchased in the US annually – majority do not get vitamin D

> Holick bought a [$40 UVB bulb](/tags/40-uvb-bulb.html) for his daughter’s pet iguana

* Komono dragons given to US were kept behind windows  were not [fertile](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=65&sort_mode=created_desc%20) (no vitamin D)

> After getting UVB they became fertile [Vet and Vitamin D](/tags/vet-and-vitamin-d.html)

* Indians and Pakistani ([dark skin](/tags/dark-skin.html)) need 3X-5X as much UVB to make as much vitamin D.  See also: [Middle East and low Vitamin D](/tags/middle-east-and-low-vitamin-d.html)

* 70% reduction in the ability of [70 year-olds](/tags/70-year-olds.html) to make vitamin D from the sun

* [Toxicity](/tags/toxicity.html) not a worry until > 150 nanograms

* [IoM error](/tags/iom-error.html) disagreed with the author of the study

> IoM said 20 ng, should have been 30 nanograms

* Even with failed kidney a person can still take vitamin D 

> Vitamin D is also converted in other parts of the body

> Holick typically gives 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks as a [loading dose](/tags/loading-dose.html)

* Every tissue in the body has a vitamin D receptor – must be for some reason

* Higher latitude ==> [higher blood pressure](/tags/higher-blood-pressure.html)

* People who work in the sun have LESS melanoma {Perhaps because they do not get sunburn}

* Melanoma occurs on the LEAST exposed portions of the skin

* Should not treat patients with the active form of vitamin D (for example if they have Kidney failure)

> It has a half life of only 4 hours

> It actually lowers the level of vitamin D in the blood ( by making it water soluble)

## Dr. Holick did not mention in this video

* Vitamin D can [treat some diseases](/tags/treat-some-diseases.html) as well as [proven to prevent](/tags/proven-to-prevent.html) many diseases

* The [reasons for vitamin D deficiency](/tags/reasons-for-vitamin-d-deficiency.html)

> Holick seems unaware that vitamin D had been in the (human/carnivore) diet

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;meat from wild animals, “[free range lard](/tags/free-range-lard.html)”, organ meats, oily fish, etc.

> [Free range eggs have 4X as much vitamin D](/posts/free-range-eggs-have-4x-as-much-vitamin-d)

> [A plea for vit D food fortification in  **India** May 2010](/tags/a-plea-for-vit-d-food-fortification-in-india-may-2010.html)

* Perhaps 1 in 300 people have an [allergic reaction to vitamin D](/tags/allergic-reaction-to-vitamin-d.html) – which should be tested for before massive loading dose of vitamin D

* There are [many reasons to take vitamin D3 and not D2](/tags/many-reasons-to-take-vitamin-d3-and-not-d2.html)

>  **Especially**  if the vitamin D supplement is not taken daily (D2 has a much shorter half-life0

* [Cofactors](/tags/cofactors.html) very important for vitamin D: from the sun and/or supplements

### People may not continue with a change (supplement vitamin D) if they lack immediate positive feedback

The positive feedback resulting in [pain reduction](/tags/pain-reduction.html), far fewer [cold/flu](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=35&sort_mode=created_desc), etc does not appear to start until >2,000 IU daily
