#### I strongly believe that Vitamin D and exercise are both very important and synergistic  
 3/4 of the population do not get enough of either one  
It is far easier to start a health habit which takes only a minute a month than one which takes 600 minutes

<!-- ~tc~
It is very difficult to compare the benefits of Vitamin D vs Exercise to health
Clearly, however, 1 minute of vitamin D for a month is better than 1 minute of exercise.
I am pretty sure, however, that 1 minute of Vitamin D is better than 100 minutes of exercise
