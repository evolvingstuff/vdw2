"We found that women who said they disliked breastfeeding were  **42 percent more likely to experience postpartum depression at two months**  compared to women who liked breastfeeding. We also found that women with severe breast pain at day one and also at two weeks postpartum were  **twice as likely to be depressed**  compared to women that did not experience pain with nursing,”

The idea for the study, published online ahead of print by the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, grew from the clinical experience of senior author, Alison Stuebe, MD, an assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the UNC School of Medicine.
