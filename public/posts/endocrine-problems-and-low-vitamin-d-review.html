In this review, we debate</p><p>38 the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of endocrine diseases.</p><p>39 Methods: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the current evidence retrieved</p><p>40 from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts.</p><p>41 Results: Evidence from basic science supports a role for vitamin D in many endocrine</p><p>42 conditions. In humans, inverse relationships have been reported between not only blood 25</p><p>43 hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations but also with risk of type 1</p><p>44 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. There is less evidence for an</p><p>45 association with Addison&rsquo;s disease or autoimmune thyroid disease. Vitamin D</p><p>46 supplementation may have a role for prevention of type 2 diabetes, but the available evidence</p><p>47 is not consistent.</p><p>48 Conclusions: Although observational studies support a potential role of vitamin D in</p><p>49 endocrine disease, high quality evidence from clinical trials does not exist to establish a place</p><p>50 for vitamin D supplementation in optimizing endocrine health. Ongoing randomized</p><p>51 controlled trials are expected to provide insight into the efficacy and safety of vitamin D in</p><p>52 the management of endocrine disease.</p><p>53</p><h3 id=introduction>Introduction</h3><p>64</p><p>65 The main physiologic role of vitamin D is to regulate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis</p><p>66 and to promote bone health. However, accumulating evidence from animal and human studies</p><p>67 suggests that vitamin D may also be important for a variety of non-skeletal actions that may</p><p>68 be important in the pathogenesis of several endocrine diseases. The increased appreciation of</p><p>69 the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D and the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in the</p><p>70 general healthy population has generated very high interest in vitamin D among researchers,</p><p>71 clinicians and the lay public. Vitamin D has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several</p><p>72 endocrine conditions, including primary hyperparathyroidism, type 1 diabetes (1), type 2</p><p>73 diabetes (2,3), autoimmune thyroid (4) adrenal diseases (5) and polycystic ovary syndrome</p><p>74 (PCOS). The present review focuses on the reported association between vitamin D status and</p><p>75 endocrine diseases and the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of</p><p>76 endocrine diseaser</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-homeostasis>Vitamin D homeostasis</h3><p>78</p><p>79 Humans derive vitamin D from cutaneous synthesis (in the form of cholecalciferol <span>[D3]</span>), from</p><p>80 diet (in the form of D3) and from nutritional supplements in the form of D3 or ergocalciferol</p><p>81 <span>[D2]</span> (6).6 Upon exposure to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin is</p><p>82 converted to pre-vitamin D3, which is immediately converted to vitamin D3 in a heat-</p><p>83 dependent process. After ingestion or synthesis, vitamin D is hydroxylated in the liver to</p><p>84 form 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D2 or 25 (OH)D3), its major circulating form, which has</p><p>85 little biological activity. 25(OH)D is converted in the kidney by 25(OH)D-1alpha-</p><p>86 hydroxylase (CYP27B1), to its bioactive hormonal metabolite 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D</p><p>87 (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D or calcitriol). The primary action of 1,25(OH)2D is through the nuclear vitamin</p><p>88 D receptor, which heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and binds to vitamin D</p><p>89 responsive elements near target genes (6,7). The primary action of 1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D is to enhance</p><p>90 intestinal calcium absorption and to promote osteoclast function, thereby maintaining calcium</p><p>91 and phosphorus homeostasis and bone health. However, the discovery that nearly all tissues in</p><p>92 the body express the vitamin D receptor and that several tissues also express CYP27B1,</p><p>93 thereby allowing for local production of 1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D with a paracrine effect, has provided</p><p>94 important insights into the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D and its potential role in a variety of</p><p>95 extra-skeletal tissues (7), including many that affect endocrine disease.</p><p>96</p><h3 id=classification-of-vitamin-d-status-and-vitamin-d-intake-requirements>Classification of vitamin D status and vitamin D intake requirements</h3><p>98</p><p>99 Blood concentration of 25OHD is the biomarker used by clinicians and researchers to</p><p>100 determine vitamin D status. However, there is no consensus on the 25OHD thresholds for</p><p>101 defining vitamin D adequacy. The guidelines by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the</p><p>102 Endocrine Society differ on classification of vitamin D status (8,9). These differences are</p><p>103 explained by the populations targeted by the guidelines and how the evidence was</p><p>104 synthesized. Specifically, the IOM guidelines concentrated on the general healthy population</p><p>105 and considered only trials and concluded that blood concentration of 25OHD > 20 ng/mL is</p><p>106 consistent with favourable skeletal outcomes. In contrast, the Endocrine Society clinical</p><p>107 practice guidelines concentrated on people at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and</p><p>108 considered both trials and observational (epidemiologic) studies in concluding that blood</p><p>109 concentration of 25OHD > 30 ng/mL is desirable for optimal skeletal outcomes without any</p><p>110 upper limit that would be concerning for safety. Both guidelines agreed that recommendations</p><p>111 will require reconsideration in the future as additional data from on-going randomized trials</p><p>112 become available. Variability in vitamin D-binding protein and bioavailable 25OHD</p><p>113 concentration may also be important when assessing vitamin D status, especially in certain</p><p>114 populations, such as African-Americans. (10)</p><p>115</p><p>116 The recommended intakes by the two guidelines also differ. The IOM report on dietary</p><p>117 reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D recommends 600 international units per day of</p><p>118 vitamin D for individuals 9-70 years and 800 international units for those older than 70 years</p><p>119 as the recommended dietary allowance (RDA), which is defined as the intake that meets the</p><p>120 needs of 97.5% of the healthy population. In contrast, the Endocrine Society clinical practice</p><p>121 guidelines conclude that to raise the blood level of 25OHD consistently above 30 ng/mL,</p><p>122 intakes of 1500 to 2000 IU/day are required. The IOM report recognized the lack of trials</p><p>123 with vitamin D supplementation for non-skeletal outcomes as a major hurdle in establishing</p><p>124 recommendations, while the Endocrine Society guidelines applied evidence from</p><p>125 observational studies to develop its recommendations and considered blood 25OHD</p><p>126 concentration as a clinically important surrogate outcome that correlates with health and</p><p>127 disease. 128</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-primary-hyperparathyroidism>Vitamin D and Primary Hyperparathyroidism</h3><p>130</p><p>131 Ionized calcium is the most tightly regulated analyte in the circulation. This fine regulation is</p><p>132 achieved through an interplay between parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin and</p><p>133 1,25(OH)2D. Parathyroid hormone is the major stimulator of renal CYP27B1, which</p><p>134 increases biosynthesis of 1,25(OH)2D. In turn, PTH is down-regulated both by 1,25(OH)2D</p><p>135 and ionized calcium.</p><p>136</p><p>137 The seemingly inactive vitamin D metabolite, 25(OH)D, is an important regulator within</p><p>138 parathyroid tissue. Parathyroid cells take up vitamin D binding protein along with its</p><p>139 25(OH)D, which is the mechanism that provides parathyroid tissue with better access to</p><p>140 circulating 25(OH)D than most other tissues. Furthermore, the parathyroid glands possess the</p><p>141 enzyme, CYP27B1, which produces 1,25(OH)2D for local paracrine regulation. The</p><p>142 combined effect of efficient access to circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D plus the local</p><p>143 production of 1,25(OH)2D is suppression of both PTH secretion and parathyroid cell</p><p>144 proliferation (11). 145</p><p>146 Larger parathyroid adenomas respond poorly to feedback by calcium or 1,25(OH)2D;</p><p>147 consequently, in primary hyperparathyroidism, 1,25(OH)2D levels often correlate positively</p><p>148 with circulating 25(OH)D (12). If vitamin D supply is low, then primary</p><p>149 hyperparathyroidism can remain latent, known as &ldquo;normocalcemic primary</p><p>150 hyperparathyroidism&rdquo; (13). Hypercalcemia develops once the 25(OH)D concentration</p><p>151 increases and elevated PTH stimulates renal CYP27B1 relentlessly, which generates</p><p>152 1,25(OH)2D in proportion to the supply of 25(OH)D. This relationship highlights a</p><p>153 fundamental aspect of the vitamin D system: its operation under first-order reaction kinetics,</p><p>154 namely, the yield of the product (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D) is proportional to the supply of the substrate</p><p>155 (25<span>[OH]</span>D). Therefore, the enzymes of the vitamin D system need to modify their function</p><p>156 according to the supply of 25(OH)D. Depending on severity, primary hyperparathyroidism</p><p>157 can disrupt the adaptation, resulting in elevated 1,25(OH)2D and increased intestinal calcium</p><p>158 absorption. While this form of hypercalcemia, promoted by the underlying parathyroid</p><p>159 adenoma, is not strictly a manifestation of vitamin D toxicity, it is a form of hypersensitivity</p><p>160 to higher doses of vitamin D that is important to consider, given how common parathyroid</p><p>161 adenomas are (14). 162</p><p>163 In healthy persons, the reference (normal) range for serum PTH is known to decline as serum</p><p>164 25(OH)D levels increase. Therefore, the theoretical plateau in PTH, as 25(OH)D increases,</p><p>165 can be used as a determinant in establishing adequacy of vitamin D status. That relationship</p><p>166 breaks down in primary hyperparathyroidism, because with disease progression, PTH</p><p>167 becomes an unregulated driver of 25(OH)D metabolism into 1,25(OH)2D, a powerful</p><p>168 hypercalcemic hormone. Ongoing research (table 1) will further clarify the effect of vitamin</p><p>169 D supplementation on hyperparathyroidism.</p><p>170</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-type-1-diabetes-t1dm>Vitamin D and type 1 diabetes (T1DM)</h3><p>172</p><p>173 Type 1 diabetes is one of the first endocrine disorders where a potential role for vitamin D</p><p>174 was reported. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by an autoimmune destruction of the insulin</p><p>175 producing pancreatic islet beta-cells, rendering patients dependent on insulin administration</p><p>176 for survival (15). Potential effects of vitamin D deficiency on T1DM are multiple, including</p><p>177 alterations in the innate immune system, such as impaired macrophage function, but also</p><p>178 dysfunction of the beta-cell itself (16). Caution, however, is warranted when postulating a</p><p>179 direct effect of vitamin D deficiency on immune or beta-cell function in vivo, as vitamin D</p><p>180 deficiency leads to decreased calcium concentration, with calcium being a crucial ion both for</p><p>181 immune function and insulin secretion. In non obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the principal</p><p>182 animal model of T1DM, severe vitamin D deficiency increases the risk for developing</p><p>183 diabetes (17), but absence of any effect on T1DM presentation in vitamin D receptor</p><p>184 knockout NOD mice suggests a redundancy of the vitamin D system in the pathogenesis of</p><p>185 T1DM (18). In vitro, the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D, directly protects beta-cells</p><p>186 from the destructive effects of inflammatory cytokines and limits the inflammatory profile of</p><p>187 macrophages (19,20).</p><p>188</p><p>189 In NOD mice, administration of high doses of 1,25(OH)2D from early life onwards lowers</p><p>190 incidence of T1DM (21, 22), highlighting vitamin D as a promising intervention in preventing</p><p>191 T1DM. To replicate the immune and metabolic effects of the active form of vitamin D seen in</p><p>192 the mouse model, very high doses are required that would induce hypercalcemia and</p><p>193 hypercalciuria and potentially bone decalcification (23). Synthetic analogues of 1,25(OH)2D</p><p>194 with immune modulatory function but lesser effects on calcium and bone have been</p><p>195 developed to overcome such an obstacle. In NOD mice, such analogues can prevent</p><p>196 progression of the disease (24,25), which has been postulated to be due to the direct beta-cell</p><p>197 protective effects of 1,25(OH)2D combined with the blocking of inflammation, together with</p><p>198 the regulator T lymphocytes, which may be partly a direct effect on T lymphocytes, but also</p><p>199 via an effect on the central antigen presenting cells, the dendritic cells (26). In vitro, the</p><p>200 presence of 1,25(OH)2D or an analogue results in the generation of dendritic cells with</p><p>201 specific characteristics, such as less IL12 secretion, less CD80/CD86 expression, less MHC II</p><p>202 expression and most importantly less stimulation of effector T cells and specific generation of</p><p>203 regulator T cells (27, 28). Thus, a second possible avenue to exploit the potential beneficial</p><p>204 immune modulatory effects of vitamin D is the auto-transfer of ex vivo 1,25(OH)2D (or</p><p>205 analogue) -exposed dendritic cells generated from peripheral blood monocytes from patients</p><p>206 with T1DM. Upon transfer back into patients, these dendritic cells should be able to induce</p><p>207 regulator T cells and shift the immune system from attack towards tolerance towards the beta-</p><p>208 cell. Clinical trials exploring this potential therapeutic avenue are underway.</p><p>209</p><p>210 In population-based studies, low vitamin D concentration especially in early life, has been</p><p>211 associated with a higher risk for T1DM (1). Lower concentrations of 25(OH)D were reported</p><p>212 in North Indian (29), Italian (30), Swedish (31), and British (32) children or young adults</p><p>213 with newly diagnosed T1DM compared to controls. An increased prevalence of vitamin D</p><p>214 deficiency in children and adolescents with T1DM compared with non-diabetic individuals</p><p>215 was also observed in American (33), Australian (34) and Qatari (35) populations. Of interest,</p><p>216 there are also reported associations between polymorphisms of genes involved in the vitamin</p><p>217 D system and metabolism and type 1 diabetes risk islet autoimmunity risk (36,37).</p><p>218</p><p>219 Several observational studies have found that supplementation (based on self-reported data)</p><p>220 with vitamin D in early life is associated with a lower risk of T1DM in later life (38,39). In a</p><p>221 retrospective case-control study in Norway, intake of cod-liver oil by children during infancy</p><p>222 did not prevent T1DM, though there was a trend towards an inverse association (40). More</p><p>223 recently, the ABIS study in Sweden reported that the use of vitamin D-containing</p><p>224 supplements during pregnancy was associated with reduced development of autoantibodies to</p><p>225 GAD or IA-2A in offspring of T1DM parents at 1 year, but not at 2.5 years (41). In small</p><p>226 intervention studies, data on the effect of vitamin D supplements in patients with established</p><p>227 T1DM have been disappointing. For example, a study in Europe showed that administration</p><p>228 of 0.25 |ig 1,25(OH)2D3 was safe but failed to reduce loss of beta-cell function, even in</p><p>229 patients with high C-peptide at diagnosis (42).</p><p>230</p><p>231 In summary, based on observational studies, vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25OHD &lt; 12</p><p>232 ng/mL) should probably be avoided in individuals at high risk for developing T1DM,</p><p>233 specifically in early life. However, whether supplementation with high dose vitamin D or its</p><p>234 analogs have a therapeutic role in prevention or treatment of T1DM is presently under</p><p>235 investigation (Table 2).</p><p>236</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-type-2-diabetes-t2dm>Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)</h3><p>238</p><p>239 Among the multiple associations that have been reported between vitamin D status and</p><p>240 chronic diseases, the link between vitamin D and T2DM stands as one of the most promising</p><p>241 ones. The potential effect of vitamin D on glycemia appears to be mediated by direct and</p><p>242 indirect effects on three different pathways: insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and systemic</p><p>243 inflammation. A direct effect of vitamin D on insulin secretion may be mediated by activation</p><p>244 of vitamin D receptors in the pancreatic beta cells. Vitamin D receptor is expressed in</p><p>245 pancreatic cells and mice lacking vitamin D receptor have impaired insulin secretion (43). In</p><p>246 addition, the direct effect of vitamin D on insulin synthesis is supported by the presence of the</p><p>247 vitamin D response element in the human insulin gene promoter (44). Importantly, pancreatic</p><p>248 beta cells express CYP27B1, thereby generating 1,25(OH)2D locally, which allows for a</p><p>249 paracrine effect of vitamin D. A direct effect of vitamin D on insulin sensitivity may be</p><p>250 mediated by stimulating the expression of insulin receptors in peripheral insulin target cells.</p><p>251 In addition, vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased fat infiltration in skeletal</p><p>252 muscle, independent of body mass, which is thought to contribute to decreased insulin action.</p><p>253 Vitamin D may also decrease the effects of systemic inflammation, known to play an</p><p>254 important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM, in several ways, which include directly</p><p>255 modulating the expression and activity of cytokines in addition to several other non-cytokine</p><p>256 related immune-modulating effects (45). Finally, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are</p><p>257 both calcium dependent processes (46,47); therefore, vitamin D could affect both pathways</p><p>258 indirectly, through alteration in calcium concentration and flux through the cell membranes of</p><p>259 the pancreas and insulin responsive tissues. 260</p><p>261 The data from observational studies strongly support an association between low vitamin D</p><p>262 status and incident T2DM. Recently, two meta-analyses of observational studies were</p><p>263 published with nearly identical results. Song et al. reported a 38% lower risk of developing</p><p>264 T2DM in the highest reference category of 25OHD compared to the lowest one (relative risk</p><p>265 0.62 <span>[95% CI 0.54-0.70]</span> (48) while Afzal et al. (49) reported an odds ratio for T2DM of 1.5</p><p>266 (95% CI 1.33-1.70) for the bottom versus top reference category of 25OHD.</p><p>267</p><p>268 Randomized studies have shown inconsistent results. In trials that included participants with</p><p>269 normal glucose tolerance or established diabetes at baseline, vitamin D supplementation had</p><p>270 no effect on glycemic measures or incident diabetes. It is crucial to note, however, that most</p><p>271 studies were underpowered or were post-hoc analyses of completed trials. In addition, the</p><p>272 results differed based on the adherence to vitamin D supplementation. For example, in a post-</p><p>273 analysis of the RECORD study, while supplementation with 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 did not</p><p>274 change the risk of self-reported type 2 diabetes, there was a notable trend towards reduction in</p><p>275 T2DM risk with vitamin D3 (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.40-1.16) among study participants</p><p>276 who were highly compliant with supplementation (50).</p><p>277</p><p>278 Vitamin D supplementation appears to be more promising in patients who are at risk for</p><p>279 diabetes. In the Calcium and Vitamin D for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CaDDM) study, a 2x2</p><p>280 factorial design trial in participants with pre-diabetes, vitamin D supplementation improved</p><p>281 disposition index, a measured of beta cell function (51). However, in another trial of non-</p><p>282 Caucasians, very high dose vitamin D supplementation had no effect on insulin secretion,</p><p>283 insulin sensitivity or incident diabetes in a population with impaired fasting glycemia or</p><p>284 impaired glucose tolerance and low vitamin D levels (52).</p><p>285</p><p>286 In summary, vitamin D appears to have no role in prevention of T2DM in the general</p><p>287 population; however, there might be a role for vitamin D for treatment of established T2DM</p><p>288 or prevention of T2DM in persons at risk, although the evidence from available trials is</p><p>289 inconsistent. There are several ongoing large randomized trials in well-defined populations</p><p>290 (D2d <span>[NCT01942694]</span>, VITAL <span>[NCT01633177]</span>, DDM2 <span>[NCT01736865]</span>, Table 2) to test the</p><p>291 hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a contributor to the pathogenesis of T2DM and to</p><p>292 define its role in prevention or therapy of T2DM.</p><p>293</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-addisons-disease>Vitamin D and Addison&rsquo;s disease</h3><p>295</p><p>296 Addison&rsquo;s disease is a rare condition resulting from autoimmune mediated destruction of the</p><p>297 adrenal cortex and may present as either isolated adrenal deficiency or part of an autoimmune</p><p>298 polyendocrine syndrome. Although the etiology of Addison&rsquo;s disease is largely elusive,</p><p>299 current concepts point to environmental factors acting as triggers in a background of genetic</p><p>300 susceptibility leading to destructive CD8-T-lymphocytic infiltration of the adrenal cortex and</p><p>301 characteristic 21-OHase antibody production (53). Although the main genetic susceptibility is</p><p>302 identified at the HLA locus (54), other susceptibility genes have been described, including in</p><p>303 the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (55) and CYP27B1 (56,57), similarly to other autoimmune</p><p>304 endocrine diseases (e.g., T1DM) (32). This shared genetic association led to the assumption</p><p>305 that the vitamin D system may be involved in critical pathophysiologic pathways in these</p><p>306 immune mediated inflammatory disorders since active 1,25(OH)2D may suppress</p><p>307 steroidogenesis by down-regulating CYP21A2 and up-regulating CYP11A1 and CYP17A1.</p><p>308 In an adrenal cell model (NCI-H295R line) (58), vitamin D acts not only on the immune</p><p>309 system but also on the adrenal tissue itself.</p><p>310</p><p>311 Whether 25(OH)D concentrations differ between patients with autoimmune Addison&rsquo;s</p><p>312 disease and controls is not known and is currently under investigation. However, there is</p><p>313 evidence of interaction between vitamin D status and predisposing gene loci, similar to</p><p>314 findings in T1DM (34). In summary, preliminary evidence suggests that vitamin D may be</p><p>315 important in modifying genetic susceptibility in Addison&rsquo;s disease; however, much remains to</p><p>316 be studied on its functional and clinical relevance in humans.</p><p>317</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-hashimotos-thyroiditis>Vitamin D and Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis</h3><p>319</p><p>320 Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis is predominantly a disease of cell-mediated immunity that is</p><p>321 manifested by a genetic defect in suppressor T-cell function. Th1 cells secrete various</p><p>322 cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-y which induces thyrocytes to express major</p><p>323 histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) surface HLA-DR antigens and renders them</p><p>324 susceptible to immunologic attack. Although HLA-DR antigens are not physiologically</p><p>325 expressed on thyrocytes, in Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis, the thyrocytes present HLA-DR antigens</p><p>326 on their surface, which may trigger autoimmune process. Activated by T lymphocytes, B</p><p>327 lymphocytes produce autoantibodies that react to thyroid antigens (59-62).</p><p>328 In Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis, the autoimmune process may be suppressed at various stages by</p><p>329 1,25(OH)2D. At first, vitamin D might suppress dendritic cell-dependent T cell activation,</p><p>330 then, it might decrease proliferation of Th1 cells and the synthesis of Th 1 cell cytokines such</p><p>331 as IFN-y. Vitamin D may also inhibit expression of MHC II surface HLA-DR antigens on</p><p>332 thyrocytes by inhibiting the synthesis of IFN-y, which induces thyrocytes to express those</p><p>333 antigens. Furthermore, after being activated by T cells, B cells&rsquo; ongoing proliferation may be</p><p>334 suppressed and B cell apoptosis may be induced by 1,25(OH)2D. In this way, vitamin D might</p><p>335 decrease autoantibodies that react with thyroid antigens (59-61).</p><p>336 Recently, studies have suggested that low vitamin D concentrations and other conditions</p><p>337 which may result with reduced vitamin D function (e.g., certain VDR gene polymorphism,</p><p>338 pathologies of vitamin D binding protein and its gene) may increase risk of Hashimoto&rsquo;s</p><p>339 thyroiditis (61,63-67). However, additional data are needed to clarify whether there is a link</p><p>340 between vitamin D status and Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis and whether vitamin D</p><p>341 supplementation might reduce the risk of Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis.</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-graves-disease>Vitamin D and Graves&rsquo; Disease</h3><p>343 Graves&rsquo; disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder in which TSH receptor autoantibodies</p><p>344 cause hyperthyroidism. Given the increasing interest in the role of vitamin D role in</p><p>345 determining susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, it has been hypothesized that Graves'</p><p>346 disease may also be affected by vitamin D, based upon its ability to modulate the immune</p><p>347 system by suppressing the proliferation of activated T cells and enhancing the phagocytic</p><p>348 ability of macrophages (68,69).</p><p>349</p><p>350 Polymorphism in the VDR gene and vitamin binding protein gene have been reported to be</p><p>351 associated to Graves&rsquo; disease&rsquo;s etiology (70,71) probably via a reduction in vitamin D</p><p>352 function, which may have an inhibitory effect on regulatory steps within the immune system.</p><p>353 The reported effects appear to differ markedly among different ethnicities, e.g. ApaI, BsmI</p><p>354 and FokI polymorphisms in the VDR gene are associated with highersusceptibility to Graves'</p><p>355 disease in Asian populations, but do not appear to play a role in Caucasian population (72).</p><p>356 Further, Feng et al. (73), recently reported that BsmI and TaqI polymorphisms are</p><p>357 significantly associated with autoimmune thyroid disorder risk, while the ApaI or FokI</p><p>358 polymorphisms are not Women with new onset Graves&rsquo; disease have decreased 25(OH)D concentration, which is</p><p>361 also associated with thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography (74). Furthermore, it has</p><p>362 been reported that 25(OH)D concentration is higher in patients who achieve remission</p><p>363 compared to those who do not (75). The current evidence to support a role of vitamin D in</p><p>364 Graves&rsquo; disease is preliminary but is worth investigating further in observational and</p><p>365 intervention studies.</p><p>366</p><h3 id=vitamin-d-and-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos>Vitamin D and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</h3><p>368</p><p>369 Accumulating evidence from several studies suggest that vitamin D may be involved in</p><p>370 several features of PCOS, such as infertility, hirsutism, insulin resistance and cardiovascular</p><p>371 risk (76,77). Wehr et al reported that women with normal ovulation had higher vitamin D</p><p>372 levels than women with PCOS (77). In addition, 25(OH)D deficiency was found to be</p><p>373 associated with lower rates of follicle development and pregnancy after stimulation in PCOS</p><p>374 women (78). Vitamin D supplementation may improve reproductive function in women with</p><p>375 PCOS by restoring normal menstrual cycles (79,80). Women with PCOS and hirsutism have</p><p>376 lower 25(OH)D levels than BMI matched controls (77, 81), which may be explained by an</p><p>377 association of vitamin D with androgens or SHBG (82,83). Vitamin D deficiency seems to</p><p>378 also have an impact on insulin sensitivity in PCOS women, as evaluated by HOMA-IR</p><p>379 (76,77,80). However, a more accurate evaluation of insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic</p><p>380 euglycemic clamp in PCOS women did not confirm such an association (84). In addition to</p><p>381 insulin resistance, vitamin D deficiency in PCOS women has been associated with</p><p>382 cardiovascular risk factors, such as high total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood</p><p>383 pressure, C reactive proteins and triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol (77). Small</p><p>384 uncontrolled intervention studies of vitamin D supplementation in women with PCOS have</p><p>385 shown improvements in fasting and stimulated glucose and dyslipidemia (triglycerides and</p><p>386 HDL) (80,85).</p><p>387 An inverse association between vitamin D status and metabolic and hormonal disturbances</p><p>388 has been reported in PCOS. However, due to the variability of the PCOS phenotype and the</p><p>389 heterogeneity of available studies, it is difficult to draw any conclusions. Ongoing randomized</p><p>390 trials in well-defined populations will help define the role of vitamin D in PCOS (Table 1).</p><p>391</p><h3 id=limitations-in-the-study-of-vitamin-d>Limitations in the study of vitamin D</h3><p>393</p><p>394 The inverse association between vitamin D status and endocrine disease in observational</p><p>395 studies may be confounded by several factors. Most importantly, good vitamin D status is</p><p>396 generally a marker of good health, as high 25(OH)D concentration is associated with young</p><p>397 age, normal body weight and a healthy lifestyle, including good dietary and exercise habits.</p><p>398 Similarly, a lower vitamin D status may reflect chronic illness, which prevents outdoor</p><p>399 activities and sun exposure. Importantly, vitamin D is rarely ingested in isolation, more often,</p><p>400 it is ingested as part of a specific food (e.g. milk), a food group (e.g. dairy) or as part of a</p><p>401 health dietary pattern (e.g. Mediterranean diet). Therefore, additional nutrients co-ingested</p><p>402 with vitamin D (e.g. fish or fortified dairy products) may have independent or synergistic</p><p>403 effects on cardiometabolic disease or, alternatively, foods rich in vitamin D may replace other</p><p>404 foods that increase risk of cardiometabolic disease (e.g. fortified milk replacing soda). Nearly</p><p>405 all available observational studies used single measurements of blood 25(OH)D as a proxy of</p><p>406 vitamin D status, which may not reflect vitamin D status over long periods as risk factors for</p><p>407 vitamin D deficiency increase with time (aging, declining physical activity, etc). Therefore,</p><p>408 inaccurate assessment of the exposure (vitamin D status) and uncontrolled or residual</p><p>409 confounding may explain the results of the observational studies, which needs to be</p><p>410 confirmed in controlled trials. An additional challenge in the study of vitamin D is that there</p><p>411 is no consensus on the 25(OH)D thresholds for vitamin D adequacy.</p><p>412</p><h3 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h3><p>415 Several observational studies have reported an association of low 25(OH)D concentration</p><p>416 with endocrine diseases. However, due to paucity of intervention studies, a causal link</p><p>417 between vitamin D deficiency and endocrine diseases is far from proven, thus no guidance</p><p>418 can be provided for or against recommending vitamin D supplementation for prevention or</p><p>419 therapy of endocrine conditions, outside of the current recommendations by the Institute of</p><p>420 Medicine for the general populations (600 to 800 IU/day depending on age and gender).</p><p>421 Ongoing and future trials are expected to provide answers to whether vitamin D</p><p>422 supplementation holds promise for endocrine health and disease.</p><p>425 Source of Funding: By research grants R01DK76092 and U01DK098245 (to A.
