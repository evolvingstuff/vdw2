Background

Interpreting and utilizing the findings of nutritional research can be challenging to clinicians, policy makers, and even researchers. To make better decisions about diet, innovative methods that integrate best evidence are needed. We have developed a decision support model that predicts how dietary choices affect life expectancy (LE).

Methods and findings

Based on meta-analyses and data from the Global Burden of Disease study (2019), we used life table methodology to estimate how LE changes with sustained changes in the intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, refined grains, nuts, legumes, fish, eggs, milk/dairy, red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages. We present estimates (with 95% uncertainty intervals <span>[95% UIs]</span>) for an optimized diet and a feasibility approach diet. An optimal diet had substantially higher intake than a typical diet of whole grains, legumes, fish, fruits, vegetables, and included a handful of nuts, while reducing red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and refined grains. A feasibility approach diet was a midpoint between an optimal and a typical Western diet. 

A sustained change from a typical Western diet to the optimal diet from  **age 20 years**  would increase LE by more than a decade for  **women**  from the United States ( **10.7**  <span>[95% UI 8.4 to 12.3]</span> years) and men (13.0 <span>[95% UI 9.4 to 14.3]</span> years). 

The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes (females: 2.2 <span>[95% UI 1.1 to 3.4]</span>; males: 2.5 <span>[95% UI 1.1 to 3.9]</span>), whole grains (females: 2.0 <span>[95% UI 1.3 to 2.7]</span>; males: 2.3 <span>[95% UI 1.6 to 3.0]</span>), and nuts (females: 1.7 <span>[95% UI 1.5 to 2.0]</span>; males: 2.0 <span>[95% UI 1.7 to 2.3]</span>), and less red meat (females: 1.6 <span>[95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]</span>; males: 1.9 <span>[95% UI 1.7 to 2.1]</span>) and processed meat (females: 1.6 <span>[95% UI 1.5 to 1.8]</span>; males: 1.9 <span>[95% UI 1.7 to 2.1]</span>). 

Changing from a typical diet to the optimized diet at age  **60 years**  would increase LE by  **8.0**  (95% UI 6.2 to 9.3) years for  **women**  and 8.8 (95% UI 6.8 to 10.0) years for men, and 80-year-olds would gain 3.4 years (95% UI females: 2.6 to 3.8/males: 2.7 to 3.9). Change from typical to feasibility approach diet would increase LE by 6.2 (95% UI 3.5 to 8.1) years for 20-year-old women from the United States and 7.3 (95% UI 4.7 to 9.5) years for men. Using NutriGrade, the overall quality of evidence was assessed as moderate. The methodology provides population estimates under given assumptions and is not meant as individualized forecasting, with study limitations that include uncertainty for time to achieve full effects, the effect of eggs, white meat, and oils, individual variation in protective and risk factors, uncertainties for future development of medical treatments; and changes in lifestyle.

Conclusions

A sustained dietary change may give substantial health gains for people of all ages both for optimized and feasible changes. Gains are predicted to be larger the earlier the dietary changes are initiated in life. The Food4HealthyLife calculator that we provide online could be useful for clinicians, policy makers, and laypeople to understand the health impact of dietary choices.

 **Why was this study done?** 

* Food is fundamental for health, and globally dietary risk factors are estimated to cause 11 million deaths and 255 million disability-adjusted life years annually.

* The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors study (GBD) provides summary measures of population health that are relevant when comparing health systems but does not estimate the impact of alterations in food group composition and respective health benefits.

* The EAT–Lancet commission did present a planetary diet, but it gives limited information on the health impact of other diets, and few people are able to adhere to strict health maximization approaches.

 **What did the researchers do and find?** 

* Our modeling methodology using meta-analyses, data from the Global Burden of Disease study and life table methodology showed that life expectancy (LE) gains for prolonged changes from typical Western to optimizing diets could translate into more than a decade for young adults.

* The largest gains would be made by eating more legumes, whole grains and nuts, and less red and processed meat.

* For older people, the gains would be smaller but substantial. Even the feasibility approach diet indicates increased LE by 7% or more for both sexes across age groups.

 **What do these findings mean?** 

* The online Food4HealthyLife calculator (https://food4healthylife.org/) enables the instant estimation of the effect on LE of a range of dietary changes.

* Understanding the relative health potential of different food groups could enable people to make feasible and significant health gains.

* The Food4HealthyLife calculator could be a useful tool for clinicians, policy makers, and laypeople to understand the health impact of dietary choices.
