ABSTRACT

Vitamin D has a well-known role in the calcium homeostasis associated with the maintenance of healthy bones. It increases the efficiency of the intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, reduces calcium losses in urine, and mobilizes calcium stored in the skeleton. However, vitamin D receptors are present ubiquitously in the human body and indeed, vitamin D has a plethora of non- calcemic functions. In contrast to most vitamins, sufficient vitamin D can be synthesized in human skin. However, its production can be markedly decreased due to factors such as clothing, sunscreens, intentional avoidance of the direct sunlight, or the high latitude of the residence. Indeed, more than one billion people worldwide are vitamin D deficient, and the deficiency is frequently undiagnosed. The chronic deficiency is not only associated with rickets/osteomalacia/ osteoporosis but it is also linked to a higher risk of hypertension, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or cancer. Supplementation of vitamin D may be hence beneficial, but the intake of vitamin D should be under the supervision of health professionals because overdosing leads to intoxication with severe health consequences. For monitoring vitamin D, several analytical methods are employed, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in detail in this review.
