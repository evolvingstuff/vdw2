#### Vegetarian Diets During Pregnancy: with supplementation, ovo-vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, vegan, and pescatarian adaptations of USDA Food Patterns can be nutritionally adequate

J Acad Nutr Diet. 2024 Aug 10:S2212-2672(24)00751-2. [doi: 10.1016/j.jand.2024.08.001](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2024.08.001)

Julie M Hess 1, Madeline E Comeau 2, Jane Lankes Smith 3, Kylie Swanson 4, Cindy M Anderson 5

Background: The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) includes a lacto-ovo vegetarian pattern (the Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern; HVDP) as one recommended dietary patterns during pregnancy.

Objective: To adapt the HVDP for vegan, ovo-vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, and pescatarian diets during pregnancy.

Design: Using food pattern modeling, four adaptations of the HVDP were developed at energy levels that may be appropriate during pregnancy (1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, and 2600 kcal/day). Models were run both with and without the addition of a composite prenatal supplement.

Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures were macro- and micronutrient adequacy without exceeding recommendations for saturated fat and added sugar.

Statistical analysis performed: The 2020-2025 DGA Food Pattern Modeling Report was used to define food groups and nutrients in the HVDP. The HVDP was revised to remove dairy and/or eggs or to add seafood.

Results: Across all examined energy levels (1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, and 2600 kcal per day), modeled dietary patterns provided sufficient macronutrients. Without prenatal supplements, each dietary pattern met most, but not all, micronutrient recommendations. Micronutrients that were below recommendations in patterns without supplements included vitamin D, iron, vitamin E, sodium, and choline. With the addition of an "composite" prenatal supplement to these patterns, the nutrients below 100% of recommendations were vitamin D, choline, and sodium.

Conclusions: Overall, these results show that a HVDP and similar diets without meat, eggs, dairy, and/or seafood can provide most nutrients needed during pregnancy, albeit with some micronutrient challenges similar to those diets that include meat and other animal products.

!!!!Vegetarian Diets During Pregnancy: with supplementation, ovo-vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, vegan, and pescatarian adaptations of USDA Food Patterns can be nutritionally adequate
J Acad Nutr Diet. 2024 Aug 10:S2212-2672(24)00751-2. doi: 10.1016/j.jand.2024.08.001
Julie M Hess 1, Madeline E Comeau 2, Jane Lankes Smith 3, Kylie Swanson 4, Cindy M Anderson 5

Background: The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) includes a lacto-ovo vegetarian pattern (the Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Pattern; HVDP) as one recommended dietary patterns during pregnancy.

Objective: To adapt the HVDP for vegan, ovo-vegetarian, lacto-vegetarian, and pescatarian diets during pregnancy.

Design: Using food pattern modeling, four adaptations of the HVDP were developed at energy levels that may be appropriate during pregnancy (1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, and 2600 kcal/day). Models were run both with and without the addition of a composite prenatal supplement.

Main outcome measures: Main outcome measures were macro- and micronutrient adequacy without exceeding recommendations for saturated fat and added sugar.

Statistical analysis performed: The 2020-2025 DGA Food Pattern Modeling Report was used to define food groups and nutrients in the HVDP. The HVDP was revised to remove dairy and/or eggs or to add seafood.

Results: Across all examined energy levels (1800, 2000, 2200, 2400, and 2600 kcal per day), modeled dietary patterns provided sufficient macronutrients. Without prenatal supplements, each dietary pattern met most, but not all, micronutrient recommendations. Micronutrients that were below recommendations in patterns without supplements included vitamin D, iron, vitamin E, sodium, and choline. With the addition of an &quot;composite&quot; prenatal supplement to these patterns, the nutrients below 100% of recommendations were vitamin D, choline, and sodium.

Conclusions: Overall, these results show that a HVDP and similar diets without meat, eggs, dairy, and/or seafood can provide most nutrients needed during pregnancy, albeit with some micronutrient challenges similar to those diets that include meat and other animal products.
