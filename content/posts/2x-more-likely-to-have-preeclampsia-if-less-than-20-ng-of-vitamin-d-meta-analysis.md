OBJECTIVE: To estimate the associations between maternal vitamin D status and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN: We searched electronic databases of the human literature in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to October, 2012 using the following keywords: 'vitamin D' and 'status' or 'deficiency' or 'insufficiency' and 'pregnancy'. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on observational studies that reported the association between maternal blood vitamin D levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth or small-for-gestational age.

RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Women with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level less than 50 nmol/l in pregnancy experienced an increased risk of 

* preeclampsia <span>[__OR 2.09__ (95%CI 1.50 -2.90)]</span>, 

* gestational diabetes mellitus <span>[__OR 1.38__ (1.12-1.70)]</span>, 

* preterm birth <span>[__OR 1.58__ (1.08-2.31)]</span> and 

* small-for-gestational age <span>[__OR 1.52__ (1.08-2.15)]</span>.

CONCLUSION: Low maternal vitamin D levels in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth and small-for-gestational age.
