#### Prescription Drugs Are the Leading Cause of Death

 **[Brownstone](https://brownstone.org/articles/prescription-drugs-are-the-leading-cause-of-death/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** 

* "37,309 drug deaths were reported to the FDA in 2006 and  
 123,927 ten years later, which is 3.3 times as many"

* "Depression drugs kill many people, mainly among the elderly, because they can cause orthostatic hypotension, sedation, confusion, and dizziness. The drugs double the risk of falls and hip fractures in a dose-dependent manner,8,9 and within one year after a hip fracture, about one-fifth of the patients will have died. As elderly people often fall anyway, it is not possible to know if such deaths are drug deaths."

* "Another example of unrecognised drug deaths is provided by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They have killed hundreds of thousands of people,1 mainly through heart attacks and bleeding stomach ulcers, but these deaths are unlikely to be coded as adverse drug reactions, as such deaths also occur in patients who do not take the drugs. "
