BACKGROUND: Low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> have been associated with a high risk of breast cancer. Since publication of the most current meta-analysis of 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk, two new nested case-control studies have emerged.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PubMed search for all case-control studies on risk of breast cancer by 25(OH)D concentration identified 11 eligible studies. Data from all  **11 studies**  were combined in order to calculate the pooled odds ratio of the highest vs. lowest quantile of 25(OH)D across all studies.

RESULTS: The overall Peto odds ratio summarizing the estimated risk in the highest compared to the lowest quantile across all 11 studies was 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.47, 0.80).

CONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that higher serum 25(OH)D levels reduce the risk of breast cancer. According to the review of observational studies, a serum 25(OH)D level of 47 ng/ml was associated with a 50% lower risk of breast cancer.
