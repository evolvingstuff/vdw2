## Points attempting to be made:

### Why take it, looks extremely promising, extremely safe, low cost, not have to remember,

## Vitamin D levels have decreased dramatically

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="Less D from sun and food makes for less D in body which results in more disease">

## Vitamin D has already been proven to  **<span style="color:#800080;">prevent </span>**  and  **<span style="color:#008080;">treat</span>**  many diseases

## Perspective: Already there are more  **<span style="color:#090;">intervention</span>**  trials for Vitamin D

## than for the [total of Vitamins A, C, E, and K combined](http://is.gd/proofvitd)

## Researchers are feeling extremely positive about the benefits of vitamin D

#### >900 INTERVENTION trials added were added in 2012

Extremely safe: 10,000 kids took >2,000 IU for 10 years, 40 years ago – still no adverse affects – no adverse affect even in grandchildren.

* [10,000 Finnish children got  **<span style="color:#00F;">2000 IU</span>** ](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1431&preview%20) chart

* [1950's-1964 Finnish children got  **<span style="color:#00F;">4000+ IU</span>** ](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1030&preview%20) chart

OK for everyone to take 1.2 milligrams every two weeks (50,000 IU) which only cost 25 cents.

Thus extremely low cost: about 2 cents per day

Not have to remember – just put it on the calendar (for example: every other Saturday), and cross it off when you take it.

It is even OK to miss by several days. Take preferably with the largest meal of the day.

Vitamin D is also available at higher cost in many forms: capsule, liquid, spray, and even vegan

## Before taking vitamin D you should confirm that you do not get a [rare allergic reaction to vitamin D](http://is.gd/proofvitd)

Take a small amount first – perhaps a tiny fraction of the 50,000 IU pill (say 1,000 to 2,000 IU)

Little economic risk – one vitamin D supplier even provides a 1 year money back guarantee

## Vitamin D levels can be re-stocked quickly

### You do not have to wait for months to feel the benefits

Should re-stock your body quickly if you are a member of a group which typically is very vitamin D deficient 

* senior, dark skin, pregnant, live very far from equator, stay indoors a lot, obese, . . .

To restock: take 50,000 IU every 3rd day for a total of 200,000 IU

Feeling better will provide excellent positive feedback for you to continue taking sunshine in a pill.

Not required, but you probably should have a [vitamin D test](/tags/vitamin-d-test.html) after 3-6 months to see if you need to take the 50,000 IU pills more frequently.

Very unlikely  that you are taking too much vitamin D, but the test will show you if you need to take more (30 ng minimum, and many people and researchers feel 50-60 is optimal)

This vitamin D in a nutshell is a tiny subset of the information at <span>[www.VitaminDWiki.com]</span>

[Extremely little interaction with drugs, diseases](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=59&sort_mode=created_desc)

If take more vitamin D you will need to take [less Calcium, more Magesium, Vitamin K2, etc,](/tags/less-calcium-more-magesium-vitamin-k2-etc.html)

(Note 50,000/14 = 3,571  <  the upper limit currently voted on in the US)

Can take 50,000 every two weeks forever if take less than 705 milligram of Calcium daily.

Adult – child would take much less?
