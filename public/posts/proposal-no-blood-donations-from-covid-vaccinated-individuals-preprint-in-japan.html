#### Researchers Call for Urgent Action to Address Mass Contamination of Blood Supply - May 2024

 **&lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-file-pdf&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 0.3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/blood-supply-contamination-pdf.pdf&quot;&gt;Mercola PDF &lt;/a&gt;** 

 **STORY AT-A-GLANCE** 

* Japanese researchers warn of the risks of using blood from mRNA COVID vaccine recipients, highlighting potential deadly effects and the need for urgent action to secure the global blood supply

* Blood contaminated with  **prion-like structures**  from the spike protein raises the risk of inducing fatal neurodegenerative diseases in recipients. The potential transmission of harmful proteins through exosomes (&quot;shedding&quot;) and the risk of autoimmune diseases due to the vaccines&#39; mechanism and components like lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are other major concerns

* Proposals for managing blood collection include rigorous donor interviews, deferral periods, and a suite of tests to ensure the safety of blood products

* The researchers advocate for comprehensive testing of both jabbed and unjabbed individuals to assess the safety of blood products and suggest discarding blood products contaminated with spike proteins or modified mRNA until effective removal methods have been developed

* They call for suspending all gene-based “vaccines” and conducting a rigorous harm-benefit assessment in light of the serious health injuries reported. They also urge countries and organizations to take concrete steps to address and mitigate the already identified risks

!!!!Researchers Call for Urgent Action to Address Mass Contamination of Blood Supply - May 2024

__STORY AT-A-GLANCE__
*Japanese researchers warn of the risks of using blood from mRNA COVID vaccine recipients, highlighting potential deadly effects and the need for urgent action to secure the global blood supply
*Blood contaminated with __prion-like structures__ from the spike protein raises the risk of inducing fatal neurodegenerative diseases in recipients. The potential transmission of harmful proteins through exosomes (&quot;shedding&quot;) and the risk of autoimmune diseases due to the vaccines&#39; mechanism and components like lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are other major concerns
*Proposals for managing blood collection include rigorous donor interviews, deferral periods, and a suite of tests to ensure the safety of blood products
*The researchers advocate for comprehensive testing of both jabbed and unjabbed individuals to assess the safety of blood products and suggest discarding blood products contaminated with spike proteins or modified mRNA until effective removal methods have been developed
*They call for suspending all gene-based “vaccines” and conducting a rigorous harm-benefit assessment in light of the serious health injuries reported. They also urge countries and organizations to take concrete steps to address and mitigate the already identified risks
