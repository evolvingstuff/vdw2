#### <span style="color:#00F;">Decreased Magnesium Intake</span>

* Chemical fertilizers do not restore Magnesium in the ground

* Meat from farm animals has less Magnesium due to chemical fertilizers

* Refining of sugar, rice, wheat removes the Magnesium

* Softening of water removes Magnesium - also bottled water

#### <span style="color:#00F;">Decreased absorption of Magnesium</span>

* Decreased Vitamin D - which is needed for absorption

* Less stomach acid in elderly - reduced acid ==> reduced Mg absorption

* Increased use of Tums/ant-acid medications - reduced acid ==> reduced Mg absorption

#### <span style="color:#00F;">Increased consumption of Magnesium in the body</span>

* [Fluoridated water chemically bonds with Magnesium](/posts/hypothesis-fluoridation-reduces-magnesium-in-body) (US and a few other countries)

* Fluoride in toothpaste and mouth rinses chemically bonds with Magnesium - when swallowed

* Sugar consumes Magnesium (28 molecules of Magnesium for 1 molecule of sugar)

* [HFCS consumes 2X more than sugar](/posts/fructose-high-fructose-corn-syrup-consumes-2x-more-magnesium-than-sugar) 56 instead of 28

* Stress increases the consumption of Magnesium

* [Many drugs have flouride](/posts/drugs-deplete-magnesium) - which chemically bonds with Magnesium
