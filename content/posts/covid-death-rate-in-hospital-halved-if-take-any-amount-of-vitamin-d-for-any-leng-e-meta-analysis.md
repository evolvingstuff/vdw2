#### Effect of Vitamin D3 Supplementation on Severe COVID-19: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials

Nutrients. 2024 May 7;16(10):1402. [doi: 10.3390/nu16101402.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16101402.)

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, vitamin D has attracted interest due to its immunomodulatory properties. Numerous studies show a correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 cases and mortality. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis in order to assess the relationship between vitamin D3 supplementation and COVID-19 severity. We included 13 randomized clinical trials that contained the analyzed endpoints: length of COVID-19 hospitalization, number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, length of stay in the ICU, number of cases requiring any supplemental oxygenation, duration of any supplemental oxygenation, number of overall mortality and number of deaths associated with COVID-19. The relative risk with 95% confidence interval (CI) and the mean difference with 95% CI were calculated to compare the effect. A random effects model was used to calculate effect sizes. Our meta-analysis showed a positive effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on ICU admission (RR = 0.73; 95% CI <span>[0.57; 0.95]</span>, p = 0.02, I2 = 19.6%) and mortality associated with COVID-19 among patients (RR = 0.56; 95% CI <span>[0.34; 0.91]</span>; p = 0.02; I2 = 0%). Vitamin D3 supplementation may potentially reduce the risk of ICU admission and death associated with COVID-19.

##### Trials in this study that quickly gave good doses had far less mortality

#### Other trials that gave good doses quickly after COVID infection rarely even entered the hospital, much less died
