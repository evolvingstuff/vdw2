Background: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism is reported to be associated with muscle mass and muscle strength. Loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle strength are the main characteristics of sarcopenia. In this study, the relationship of VDR gene polymorphism with muscle traits (muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance) and sarcopenia were studied in Xinjiang, China.

Methods: Totally, 205 sarcopenia patients were enrolled. Propensity score method was used to match control group. FokI and BsmI polymorphisms were genotyped using improved multiplex ligation detection reaction (iMLDR).

Results: Fok1, but not Bsm1, polymorphism was significantly associated with sarcopenia. Patients with Fok1 GG genotype were more likely to have sarcopenia. Both Bsm1 and Fok1 polymorphism were related to muscle traits. Patients with Bsm1 CT genotype had lower gait speed (GS) but higher skeletal mass index. Patients with Fok1 GG genotype had lower GS, and female subjects with the Fok1 GG genotype had lower handgrip strength (HS). GS was decreased in Bsm1 CT genotype than CC carriers. HS and GS were decreased in Fok1 GG genotype than AA carriers.

Conclusion: Fok1, but not Bsm1, polymorphism is associated with sarcopenia. Both Bsm1 and Fok1 polymorphism affect both HS and GS.
