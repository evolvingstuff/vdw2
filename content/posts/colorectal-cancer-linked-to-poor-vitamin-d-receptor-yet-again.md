#### Note: Several Cancers have "learned" how to protect themselves from Vitamin D  
After the cancer starts, it decreases the Vitamin D Receptor activation.  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus for some cancers: <span style="color:#00F;">Cancer ==> poor VDR</span>, rather than poor VDR ==> Cancer

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and there has been a significant increase in the incidence of CRC in recent decades. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify blood biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis. It is not yet clear whether the level of vitamin D and its receptor, vitamin D receptor (VDR), in the blood are helpful factors in the diagnosis of CRC. Therefore, the study focuses on determining the VDR serum levelâ€™s contribution and other chemical parameters to the risk of CRC. A total of 189 Saudi participants (66 CRC patients and 123 control patients) aged 20-80 years old were enrolled in this case-control study. A serum sample was collected from each participant, and the levels of VDR and other bone profile tests were determined using ELISA or chemiluminescent assays. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The results showed a highly significant reduction in the levels of total vitamin D (P < 0.0001), VDR (P < 0.0001), vitamin D3 (P < 0.05), and calcium (P < 0.0001) in the serum of CRC patients compared to the controls. However, the alkaline phosphatase level was higher in CRC patients compared to the controls (P < 0.0001). None of the blood markers showed a significant correlation to the progression of CRC (P > 0.05). More investigation is needed to elucidate different physiological processes that can be affected by these blood biomarkers, therefore changing the carcinogenesis of CRC.
