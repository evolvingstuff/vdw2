FDA requires very little documentation and can quickly decide in emergencies such as COVID

The principal investigator wrote an application for Emergency Use of  **Fluvoxamine**  for SARS-COV-2 in <span style="color:#F00;">4 days</span>

&nbsp; &nbsp;VitaminDWiki has requested a copy of his application and tips on how to communicate with the FDA

 **--The FDA gave the EUA about a week later--**  I had misread the WSJ article, it has not been approved (yet)

It appears that EUAs must specify:   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Dose size,  
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Dosing interval  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; When it is taken (before or after entering the hospital, for example)  
 &nbsp; &nbsp;How it is taken: Oral, injection, topical

 **The FDA gives EUAs for Food, Drugs, Chemicals or Devices - but not supplements  
Perhaps the FDA could give a EUA for Vitamin D (Which has been used for food fortification)** 

 **The FDA could also issue a EUA for semi-activated Vitamin D = Calcidiol = Calcifediol =25(OH)D   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; which is a prescribed (high profit) drug in the US**

#### Ranking of  Early Treatments of COVID

 **Note: Vitamin D appears to be even better for prophylaxis (prevention) than early treatment  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; but there is a lot more data for early treatment** 

 **Note: It appears that high-dose Vitamin D is the only way to quickly improve the immune system**
