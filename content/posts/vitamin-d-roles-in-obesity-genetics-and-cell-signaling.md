#### The beneficial role of vitamin D in obesity: possible genetic and cell signaling mechanisms.

Nutr J. 2013 Jun 25;12(1):89. 

Vinh Qu C L Ng K, Nguy N LT.

The prevalence rates of overweight and obesity are considered an important public issue in the United States, and both of these conditions are increasing among both children and adults. There is evidence of aberrations in the vitamin D-endocrine system in obese subjects. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with obesity, and many studies have demonstrated the significant effect of calcitriol on adipocytes. 

Genetic studies have provided an opportunity to determine which  **proteins**  link vitamin D to obesity pathology, including the 

* vitamin D receptor, 

* toll-like receptors, the 

* renin-angiotensin system, 

* apolipoprotein E, 

* vascular endothelial growth factor, and 

* poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. 

Vitamin D also exerts its effect on obesity through  **cell-signaling mechanisms** , including 

* matrix metalloproteinases, 

* mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, the 

* reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, 

* prostaglandins, 

* reactive oxygen species, and 

* nitric oxide synthase.

In conclusion, vitamin D may have a role in obesity. 

The best form of vitamin D for use in the obese individuals is  **calcitriol**  because it is the active form of the vitamin D3 metabolite, 

its receptors are present in adipocytes, and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression.
