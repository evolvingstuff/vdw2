## [News Release](http://www.fraserhealth.ca/about_us/media_centre/news_releases/2011_news_releases/new_vitamin_d_protocol_helps_prevent_falls_and_fractures_in_residential_care)

Optional for all Fraser Health 7,500 senior residents in Western Canada

Cost per year to Fraser Health of providing the vitamin D is estimated to about that of the cost of a single hip fracture , $20,000

Before vitamin D they had 1,000 to 1,500 falls per year

They hope to prevent 10% to 25% of the falls per year

Thus they hope to prevent 100 to about 300 falls per year

### Notes from phone conversation with Michael McBryde  at Fraser Health Nov 23, 2011

Vitamin D has a problem of following other “wonder drugs” which proved to be not so beneficial – but this time is different.  A problem of “cry wolf”.

Great resistance by many doctors to try vitamin D until after extensive and solid evidence.

Their program is somewhat funded by the Canadian govt (after 18 months of effort).

Fraser has issued quarterly reports – such as hip fractures as required in Canada

They should have a large enough dataset – with 7,000 residents – to easily detect the reduction in fractures etc. as a result of adding vitamin D

They will not have vitamin D tests before and during the protocol – too expensive.

All prescriptions are given by nurses to the senior home residents, approximately 85% of whom are demented.

Prescription of 20,000 IU tablet once per week. 

&nbsp; &nbsp;Had considered once per month, but was concerned that the resident might be absent on the day of the month that it was given.

He expects a very high participation rate – as the doctors must give a reason why their patients should not participate. - This might be called an opt-out situation.

A very small percentage of the residents will not participate – probably due being on dialysis or having high levels of Calcium

#### Future expansion of the program:

– Add co-factors of Vitamin K2 and Magnesium (the residents already get enough Calcium) to improve the effectiveness of the vitamin D on the bones

–  Add more vitamin D for those at high risk (dark skin, obese, etc)

– Others in Fraser Health will probably elect in the future to extend vitamin D to some of the 99.9% of Fraser Health who are not in senior facilities
