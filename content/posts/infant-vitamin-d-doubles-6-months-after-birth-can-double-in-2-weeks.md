 **The study appears to assume that all children were given 400 IU of vitamin D daily** 

Background The requirement of vitamin D in different stage may be diverse, but research on the variation trend of vitamin D status during infancy is scarce. 

Objective This study aimed to explore the variation trend of vitamin D status and influencing factors of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency during wintertime among infants. 

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 500 infants were included in our study during January to March 2017. The serum 25(OH)D was performed by chemiluminescent assay. Multivariate Logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the influencing factors of vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency. 

Results The older infants had a higher concentration of vitamin D than younger infants (r=0.62, <0.0001). And the overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were 33.80% and 18.00%, respectively. With the increase of month age, the risk of vitamin D deficiency (OR=0.63, 95%CI: 0.57-0.70) and insufficiency (OR=0.69, 95%CI: 0.62-0.77) were both declined. In addition, the infant with low birthweight, breastfed, living in rural area were correlated with a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency (P<0.05). 

Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency prevalence changed with month age, routine monitoring of vitamin D levels is necessary for infant.
