Vitamin D intoxication (VDI) usually develops due to inappropriate use of vitamin D in high doses by the families of infants with complaints suggestive of vitamin D deficiency such as delayed teething, knock knees, or delayed walking. We present here an experience of treating an infant with asymptomatic VDI that had a prolonged course of recovery and a sustainable level of vitamin D over a follow-up period of 2.5 years. In our patient, vitamin D started to drop steadily after a month of stopping vitamin D supplements but not to a normal level. It reached an acceptable level only after six months. This case emphasizes the importance of educating parents about the empirical use of vitamin D over the counter, assessing the baseline level of serum vitamin D level prior to initiation of treatment and highlights the value of verifying additional dietary sources of vitamin D or oral supplements in patient's history.
