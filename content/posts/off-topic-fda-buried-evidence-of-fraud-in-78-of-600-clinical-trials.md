 **The FDA buries evidence of fraud in medical trials. My students and I dug it up (Subtitle)** 

* “When the FDA finds scientific fraud or misconduct, the agency doesn’t notify the public, the medical establishment, or even the scientific community that the results of a medical experiment are not to be trusted”

* ‘The FDA has repeatedly hidden evidence of scientific fraud not just from the public, but also from its most trusted scientific advisers, even as they were deciding whether or not a new drug should be allowed on the market. “

* “Even a congressional panel investigating a case of fraud regarding a dangerous drug couldn't get forthright answers”
