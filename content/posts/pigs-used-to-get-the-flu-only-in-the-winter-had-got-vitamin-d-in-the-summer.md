#### [Russ Daly: Is it flu season for animals too?](https://www.farmforum.net/farm_forum/russ-daly-is-it-flu-season-for-animals-too/article_7e6a4f0a-801b-55b1-aecb-4104e7d7ee81.html)

* "Of our domestic animals, it’s pigs that most often encounter influenza — something we’ve recognized for decades. For much of that history, we considered swine influenza to be very much a seasonal disease. I remember being called out to examine groups of pigs in late fall and winter that suddenly went off feed and began coughing. The “barking” cough characteristic of a swine influenza outbreak made you wonder if the barn was filled with dogs instead of pigs! In most cases, these outbreaks would resolve themselves after a few days."

* "Today, swine influenza paints a different picture. Those seasonal outbreaks of yesteryear typically occurred in pigs spending time outdoors."
