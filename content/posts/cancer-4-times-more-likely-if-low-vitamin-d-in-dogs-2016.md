> Humans as well as animals

 **[Overview Veterinary and vitamin D](/posts/overview-veterinary-and-vitamin-d)** 

Most vets have found that animals need 30 IU per kg 

15 kg pet ==> 450 IU: 5,000 IU once every 10 days 

30 kg pet ==> 900 IU: 5,000 IU once every 5 days 

45 kg pet ==>1350 IU: 5,000 IU once every 4 days

 **Relative risk of the disease group compared with that of the control group**

25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is important in bone health as well as many diseases including cancer. Supplementation may increase responsiveness of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Serum 25(OH)D, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and canine C-reactive protein (c-CRP) were measured in healthy dogs and dogs with haemoabdomen. Regression analysis determined optimal 25(OH)D concentrations. In healthy dogs (n = 282), mean iPTH concentrations correlated inversely (r(2) = 0.88, P < 0.001) to 25(OH)D concentrations. Variation in both iPTH and c-CRP plateaued at 25(OH)D concentrations of 100-120 ng mL(-1) . Haemoabdomen dogs (n = 63, 43 malignant and 20 benign) had 25(OH)D concentrations ranging from 19.4 to >150 ng mL(-1) . 

Relative risk of cancer increased with decreasing 25(OH)D concentrations <span>[__RR = 3.9__ for 25(OH)D below 40 ng mL(-1) (P = 0.0001)]</span>. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in dogs vary widely, and are influenced by dietary VitD content. Serum vitD measurement can identify dogs for which supplementation may improve health and response to cancer therapy.

#### Clips from the study

*  **“This data has been previously presented at the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Forum, June 2013, Seattle, WA, USA”** 

* “It should be noted that dogs with insufficient vitamin D, despite a 6–12 month follow-up period, should still be considered at risk for the development of disease such as  **cardiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and cancer** as previously published.42– 46”

* As the majority of these dogs eat commercial dog food diets, our data likely reflect the level of vitamin D supplementation that exists today, rather than what should be considered adequate. “

>  **Note by VitaminDWiki: Many farm-animal and zoo-animal vets have found that they need to give 3X the amount of vitamin D to keep the animals healthy than what the US govt recommends. Suspect that the pets also need more, but pet vets get more income when if there is poor health, thus they have a negative incentive to keep the pets healthy**
