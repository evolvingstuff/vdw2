No human trials have been made for Vitamin D lethal doses

But, trials were have been made with dogs  -the observed LD50 is a single 88 mg/kg

For an adult human weighing 75 kg this amount (for dogs) would be 6,600 mg = 264,000,000 IU

Note - the most Vitamin D you can get in a bottle is 100 X 50,000 = 5 million IU per bottle

 **A person would have to consume 52 bottles of vitamin D to commit suicide** 

* There are many much easier and cheaper ways to commit suicide

> breathe inert gas such as Nitrogen

   * Lethal dose which will kill half of the rats (LD-50) = 17 mg/kg of rat = 680,000 IU per kg 

* [Death from Vitamin D overdose - 600,000 IU daily for 3 weeks - April 2016](/posts/death-from-vitamin-d-overdose-600000-iu-daily-for-3-weeks) = 12.6 million IU

   * Resulted in death of a small boy. Wonder if 3X higher dose would have killedl an adult
