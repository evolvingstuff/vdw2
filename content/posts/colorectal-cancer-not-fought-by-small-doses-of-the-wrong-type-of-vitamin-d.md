#### Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer: Current Perspectives and Future Directions

J Cancer Prev. 2022 Sep 30;27(3):147-156. [doi: 10.15430/JCP.2022.27.3.147.](https://doi.org/10.15430/JCP.2022.27.3.147.)

Vitamin D is considered to be the main mediator of the beneficial effects of sun exposure. In humans, highest expression of Vitamin D receptors is found in the intestinal tract. In addition, 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (or calcitriol), the most active Vitamin D metabolite, plays important homeostatic roles in the intestine, particularly calcium absorption. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level of < 20 ng/mL. Prsevious studies show that higher circulating 25(OH)D levels are associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and improved survival. Most research to date has been conducted in animals, specifically mice. Although human studies have a limited number of participants, one study recruiting a large cohort of patients with advanced or metastatic CRC revealed that higher plasma 25(OH)D levels are associated with improved overall and progression-free survival. However, the effects of Vitamin D supplementation on incidence and mortality of CRC remain inconclusive. Although Vitamin D may help to prevent cancer, there is a paucity of research demonstrating conclusively that Vitamin D alters prognosis after chemotherapy. Here, we review the mechanisms by which Vitamin D affects CRC, as well as the results of clinical, epidemiological, and human intervention studies. We also discuss current perspectives and future directions regarding Vitamin D and CRC.
