#### <span style="color:#00F;">The best reduction in childhood asthma comes results from a good level of vitamin D at 4 week of pregnancy, when lung development starts</span>

#### 2400 IU started at 24th week of pregnancy did not result in a statistically significant decrease

 **Probably not achieve a good level until week 34, but needed a good level at week 4**

Evidence suggests that low in utero vitamin D levels may be associated with risk of asthma in offspring.1 The Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 vitamin D randomized clinical trial (RCT) found that at the age of 3 years, children of women randomized to high-dose vs standard-dose vitamin D did not have a statistically significant reduced risk of persistent wheeze; however, a clinically important protective effect could not be excluded (hazard ratio, 0.76 <span>[95% CI, 0.52-1.12]</span>).2 Because diagnosing asthma early in life is difficult, we followed up the children at the age of 6 years to assess the risk of current asthma.
