#### Which silicon supplements have good bio-availability? Asked [Perplexity AI with Deep Reasoning Feb 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/which-silicon-supplements-have-03knhoooRSeOT2Ex_3qeBQ)

 **Bioavailability of Silicon Supplements: A Comprehensive Analysis of Effective Forms and Clinical Evidence** 

Silicon, a trace mineral essential for connective tissue health, bone formation, and collagen synthesis, has gained attention for its role in human nutrition. However, the efficacy of silicon supplements hinges on bioavailability—the proportion absorbed and utilized by the body. This report synthesizes evidence from peer-reviewed studies, clinical trials, and commercial formulations to identify silicon supplements with high bioavailability, examining their chemical forms, stabilization methods, and clinical outcomes.

 **Key Forms of Silicon Supplements and Their Bioavailability** 

 **Monomethylsilanetriol (MMST)** 

Monomethylsilanetriol (MMST), a monomeric organosilicon compound, exhibits exceptional bioavailability due to its stability in solution and resistance to polymerization. Clinical trials demonstrate that MMST achieves  **~64% bioavailability** , significantly outperforming silica (SiO₂) and horsetail extracts [3](https://www.biomedica.com.au/sussing-out-silicon) [7](https://girlboss.com/a/blog/best-silica-supplement). In humans, MMST supplementation elevates serum silicon levels, supporting its use in osteoarthritis and skin health [3](https://www.biomedica.com.au/sussing-out-silicon) [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16205932/). For instance, a study comparing MMST to colloidal silica found urinary silicon excretion rates 14 times higher with MMST, confirming its superior absorption [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681588/). Commercial products like Orgono Living Silica and Dr. Mercola Silica Collagen Builder leverage MMST’s stability, with trials showing improved nail strength and skin elasticity [7](https://girlboss.com/a/blog/best-silica-supplement) [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16205932/).

 **Orthosilicic Acid (OSA) and Stabilized Variants** 

Orthosilicic acid (OSA), the biologically active form of silicon, is highly bioavailable but prone to polymerization at neutral pH, reducing solubility. Stabilization strategies address this limitation:

1.  **Choline-Stabilized OSA (ch-OSA)** : By binding OSA to choline, polymerization is inhibited, maintaining monomeric form. A double-blind trial found that ch-OSA (12 mg Si/day) increased serum silicon by 173 μg/L and improved bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2442067/) [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16205932/). However, ch-OSA’s high alkalinity (pH 7.9) may disrupt intestinal epithelium integrity in vitro, raising safety concerns [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681588/).

1.  **Collagen-Stabilized OSA** : Emerging as a safer alternative, collagen-stabilized OSA enhances bioavailability without epithelial toxicity. Comparative studies show collagen matrices improve silicon retention in the glycocalyx, facilitating absorption [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681588/).

OSA formulations like California Gold Nutrition Choline Silica Complex and Orthopur Si utilize these stabilization methods, achieving bioavailability comparable to MMST [9](https://www.californiagoldnutrition.com/products/california-gold-nutrition-choline-silica-complex-2-fl-oz-59-ml-96259) [15](https://gettyequinenutrition.com/products/orthopur-si).

 **Calcium Silicate** 

Certain calcium silicate variants demonstrate moderate bioavailability, contingent on solubility. A crossover study comparing calcium silicate, horsetail grass, and silicon-amino acid complexes found calcium silicate excreted  **15.2 mg Si/10 hours** —fourfold higher than alternatives [>4](https://askthescientists.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CRB_USANA_SiliconBioavailability.pdf). However, insoluble calcium silicate forms (e.g., some antacids) exhibit negligible absorption, underscoring the importance of selecting hydrolytically active variants [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2744664/).

 **Factors Influencing Silicon Bioavailability** 

 **Chemical Speciation and Polymerization** 

Silicon’s absorption inversely correlates with polymerization degree. Monomeric forms (OSA, MMST) are readily absorbed, while polymeric colloids (e.g., bamboo silica) require gastrointestinal breakdown, reducing bioavailability [11](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/18/6255) [16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2744664/). For example, OSA concentrations >2 mM trigger polymerization into non-absorbable polysilicic acids unless stabilized [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95220-2) [11](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/18/6255).

 **pH and Solubility** 

Gastric acidity solubilizes dietary silica into OSA, but aging-related pH elevation impairs this conversion [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4938278/). Supplements with pH-neutral, pre-solubilized silicon (e.g., MMST, ch-OSA) bypass this limitation, enhancing absorption in elderly populations [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4938278/) [15](https://gettyequinenutrition.com/products/orthopur-si).

 **Stabilization Agents** 

 **Choline** : Prevents OSA polymerization but may irritate intestinal lining [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681588/).

 **Collagen and Maltodextrin** : Improve solubility without toxicity, ideal for long-term use [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32681588/).

 **L-Carnitine** : Enhances cellular uptake synergistically, as seen in California Gold Nutrition’s formulation [9](https://www.californiagoldnutrition.com/products/california-gold-nutrition-choline-silica-complex-2-fl-oz-59-ml-96259).

 **Clinical Evidence and Commercial Applications** 

 **Bone Health** 

Ch-OSA supplementation (6–12 mg Si/day) over 12 months increased femoral BMD by 2.3% in osteopenic women, attributed to collagen synthesis stimulation [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2442067/) [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16205932/). Similarly, MMST elevated tibial silicon concentrations in poultry models, indicating bone matrix integration [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35292-9) [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6242837/).

 **Dermatological Benefits** 

A 20-week trial of ch-OSA (10 mg Si/day) reduced skin roughness by 16% and improved hair/nail brittleness scores by 40%, linked to dermal hydroxyproline increases [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16205932/). MMST’s role in keratinocyte activation further supports its use in KAL Silica Plus and Eidon Liquid Silica for hair strength [7](https://girlboss.com/a/blog/best-silica-supplement) [14](https://us.supersmart.com/en/shop/joints-bones-muscles/orthosilicic-acid-supplement-0817).

 **Comparative Efficacy** 

 **MMST vs. OSA** : MMST’s stability grants it higher bioavailability (64% vs. 43% for OSA) [3](https://www.biomedica.com.au/sussing-out-silicon) [14](https://us.supersmart.com/en/shop/joints-bones-muscles/orthosilicic-acid-supplement-0817).

 **OSA vs. Horsetail Extract** : Horsetail’s silica content is largely non-bioavailable (4–11 mg/L vs. 400 mg/L for stabilized OSA) [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35292-9) [4](https://askthescientists.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CRB_USANA_SiliconBioavailability.pdf)

 **Recommendations for Optimal Silicon Supplementation** 

1.  **Prioritize Monomeric Forms** : MMST and stabilized OSA (collagen > choline) offer the highest absorption rates.

1.  **Dose Considerations** : 10–20 mg Si/day aligns with EFSA safety thresholds and clinical efficacy [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95220-2) [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2442067/).

1.  **Formulation Synergy** : Combinations with collagen peptides (e.g., Daily Beauty) enhance connective tissue outcomes [14](https://us.supersmart.com/en/shop/joints-bones-muscles/orthosilicic-acid-supplement-0817).

1.  **Avoid Insoluble Silicates** : Bamboo and horsetail extracts provide limited benefit due to low solubility [4](https://askthescientists.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/CRB_USANA_SiliconBioavailability.pdf) [7](https://girlboss.com/a/blog/best-silica-supplement).

 **Conclusion** 

Silicon supplementation’s therapeutic potential depends critically on bioavailability. Current evidence positions MMST and stabilized OSA (particularly collagen-bound) as the most effective forms, validated by serum pharmacokinetics and clinical endpoints. Calcium silicate variants and OSA-choline complexes remain viable but require careful selection based on solubility and safety profiles. Future research should explore long-term outcomes of collagen-stabilized OSA and MMST in aging populations, addressing connective tissue degeneration and osteoporosis.

#### Silicon: A neglected micronutrient essential for bone health – March 2021

Exp Biol Med (Maywood) . 2021 Mar 9;1535370221997072. [doi: 10.1177/1535370221997072](https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370221997072) PDF expected to be frree June 2022

Bone matrix is predominantly made up of collagen, and in vitro and in animal models studies have shown that silicon is linked to glycosaminoglycans and plays an important role in the formation of cross-links between collagen and proteoglycans, determining the beneficial effects on strength, composition, and mechanical properties of bone. However, there are still no precise indications regarding a possible role of silicon on bone health in humans. Given this background, the aim of this narrative review was to consider the effectiveness of silicon dietary intake and silicon dietary supplementation (alone or with other micronutrients), in order to suggest a daily dosage of Si supplementation, on bone mineral density in humans. This review included eight eligible studies: four regarding dietary intake and four considering supplementation with silicon alone or with other nutrients. Despite the number of studies considered being low, the number of subjects studied is high (10012) and the results are interesting. 

Although to date the available scientific evidences are not considered valid enough to allow to establish an adequate level of Silicon intake, based on extrapolations from the data obtained with studies on animal and human models, it has been suggested that an adequate intake in order to promote beneficial effects for bone could be considered to be around  **25 mg silicon/day** . 

As for silicon dietary supplements, it has been shown that the combined treatment with  **orthosilicic acid (6 mg), calcium, and vitamin D**  has a potentially beneficial effect on femoral BMD compared to only use of calcium and vitamin D.

This study presents findings on the biological action of an integrated supplement containing the following components involved in osteogenesis and mineralization: vitamin D and silicon in the bioavailable and soluble form. A hypothesis that these components potentiate one another’s action and make calcium absorption by the body more efficient was tested. Biological tests of the effect of vitamin D and silicon chelates on bone fracture healing and bone turnover were conducted using ICR mice and albino Wistar rats. Radiographic and biochemical studies show that the supplement simultaneously containing silicon chelates and vitamin D stimulates bone tissue regeneration upon mechanical defects and accelerates differentiation of osteogenic cells, regeneration of spongy and compact bones, and restoration of bone structure due to activation of osteoblast performance. Bone structure restoration was accompanied by less damage to skeletal bones, apparently due to better absorption of calcium from food. The studied supplement has a similar effect when used to manage physiologically induced decalcification, thus holding potential for the treatment of osteomalacia during pregnancy or occupational diseases (e.g., for managing bone decalcification in astronauts).
