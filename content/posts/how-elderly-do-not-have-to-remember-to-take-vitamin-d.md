# (Preventing) two birds with one stone: improving vitamin d levels in the elderly.

J Prim Health Care. 2011 Jun 1;3(2):150-2.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: A majority of adults have sub-optimal vitamin D levels in the winter in southern New Zealand. This is associated with an increased risk of falls and fragility fractures in the elderly, with long-term adverse outcomes likely. Vitamin D supplementation decreases the risks of both falls and fractures. 

ASSESSMENT OF PROBLEM: An intervention was undertaken by a small urban general practice to increase the number of elderly patients receiving vitamin D supplementation by linking vitamin D prescription to the annual flu vaccination campaign. 

RESULTS: Uptake of the supplementation was high and costs to the practice low. Thirty-eight patients were identified for whom long-term supplementation with vitamin D was indicated. 

STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT: The study could have been strengthened by incorporating a more formal method of evaluating uptake. 

LESSONS: Encouraging patients to take supplements as a population-based strategy is a realistic intervention, and linking it to the flu vaccination campaign is both seasonally appropriate and efficient.

# Just mark it on the calendar

With the current large sizes of vitamin D doses vitamin D can be taken just once a week or even every other week.

Just mark it on the calendar, say on Saturday

When Saturday comes along, take the vitamin D and mark it off the calendar

If happen to not notice the calendar for a few days, just proceed as above - it does not matter if you take the dose as much as a week late.

# A blister pack might be a good solution for vitamin D for the elderly.

Only have to take one gel-cap per week. 

Each blister would be labeled for the week. 

The person could take the tiny gel-cap anytime during the week.

Everyone can easily see if a gel-cap had been taken - the blister is broken and pill is missing

If forgotten, gel-cap could be taken as much as 4 weeks late - 4 at a time is OK

The following is an example of a blister pack with 4 columns and 12 rows.

Columns = weeks 1, 2, 3, 4

Rows = months: Jan, Feb, Mar, April, …

Last row would have 4 extra pills to be taken for flus, colds, etc.

For the elderly 4,000 IU daily is good, so the weekly gel cap would be 28,000 IU: 25,000 IU caps are available as of June 2011

## Vitamin D can eliminate many reasons people STOP taking a pill

* Cost

* Not feel the benefit

* Strong side effects

* Worry about future side effects/interactions

## Blister pack can eliminate some other reasons people stop

* Taking too many pills – too complex

* Bother

## Blister pack can also eliminate some reasons people do not start initially

* Do not want to have to do something new daily

* Feel that should not have to take supplements (maybe)

* Fear ridicule by family and friends

* Already taking too many pills everyday

* Think that will not feel benefit in the short term

* Worry about side effects – kidney stones, toxicity, etc

* Do not want to feel controlled by someone else – how to deal with this??

   * Give them freedom of day of week

   * Give them freedom to take more or less

   * Give them freedom to skip a week or so

   * Give them freedom of time of the day to take it

   * Give them freedom to spread it out over the day or several days
