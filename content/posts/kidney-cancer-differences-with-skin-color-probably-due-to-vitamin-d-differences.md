#### Differences in 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations May Explain the Black-White Differences

in Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk of Renal Cell Carcinoma

Epidemiology • Volume XX, Number XXX, XXX 2015

To the Editor:

The recent article by Hofmann and colleagues1 reported increased association of chronic kidney disease with renal cell carcinoma for blacks, Asians, and Hispanics, but not whites. The black-white disparity for renal cell carcinoma incidence for blacks was attributed to hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The authors recommended additional studies to evaluate the possible factors underlying the association between chronic kidney disease and risk of renal cell carcinoma. This letter outlines the evidence that racial differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations may explain the findings.

Due to dark skin pigmentation and the fact that most vitamin D is produced in the skin through ultraviolet-B exposure, black Americans have lower 25(OH)D concentrations than white Americans.2,3 A study based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey- linked Medicare claims files found that, over a 9.1-year follow-up, non-Hispanic blacks individuals “had a 2.83-fold (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span> = 1.03, 7.77) higher risk for developing (end- stage renal disease) compared with non-Hispanic white individuals. Additional adjustment for 25(OH)D levels reduced the risk by 58% (incidence rate ratio 1.77; 95% CI = 0.38, 8.21).”2 

Another study using data from the same survey found a multifactor adjusted black-white systolic blood pressure difference of 4.0 mmHg; adding 25(OH) D concentration reduced the race difference to 2.9 mmHg, which was increased to 4.0 mmHg when those on antihypertensive medications were excluded. 3 Low 25(OH)D concentrations are also a risk factor for renal cell carcinoma. Blood was drawn at time of enrollment and people were enrolled between 1992 and 2000 and followed up to December 2004 to June 2010 depending on the country. The odds ratio for a doubling of 25(OH)D concentration was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.68, 0.99).4 While no results are presented for Hispanics, the finding in Ref. 1 that their risk of renal cell carcinoma with respect to hypertension and chronic kidney disease is intermediate between that for blacks and whites is consistent with the fact that they have mean 25(OH)D concentrations intermediate between blacks and whites due to having skin pigmentation intermediate between the two races.
