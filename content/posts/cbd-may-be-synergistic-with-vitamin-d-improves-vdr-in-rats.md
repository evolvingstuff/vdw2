#### Cannabidiol improves thyroid function via modulating vitamin D 3 receptor in vitamin D 3 deficiency diet-induced rat model

J Food Sci Technol . 2022 Aug;59(8):3237-3244.

[doi: 10.1007/s13197-022-05492-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13197-022-05492-3)    **PDF is behind paywall for a year** 

Mahendra Kumar Trivedi 1, Sambhu Mondal 2, Snehasis Jana 2

The study was evaluated the impact of cannabidiol (CBD) on thyroid hormones by modulation cannabinoid receptor-2 (CB2) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in rats fed with vitamin D3 deficiency diet (VDD). CB2-receptors were analyzed by RT-PCR method and others biomarkers by ELISA.

* The relative expression of CB2 (thyroid ~ 4 folds), 

* VDR protein (liver, 151.72%)), and 

* (kidney, 66%) was significantly increased in CBD-60 compared to VDD. 

Vitamin D3 metabolites were significantly increased 

* serum (189.42%), 

* kidney (73.84%), and 

* liver (58.11%) in CBD-60 than VDD. 

Increased thyroxine (59.9%) and calcitonin (213.59%); while decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (36.15%) and parathyroid hormone (38.64%) was observed CBD treatment in VDD rats. 

In conclusion, CBD treatment improves CB2 and VDR expression and the level of vitamin D3 metabolites, along with improved thyroid hormones, including calcitonin. This is the first report with an improved CB2 and VDR expression after CBD treatment in VDD induced animals. Thus, CBD can be considered to use in hypothyroidism conditions and to maintain bone health.

#### Founder of VitaminDWiki researched CBD and Vitamin D in 2017: the combination looked very promising

Looked at >100 items on the web at the time

Have been taking a dropper full of CBD about 3 times per week since then

Expect RCTs to find that CBD improved vitamin D/VDR in humans sometime in the 2020's

#### The Many Medicinal Benefits of Cannabis and Cannabidiol (CBD) - Mercola Aug 2022

 **[Mercola](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2022/08/08/cannabis-cannabidiol-benefits.aspx?ui=d738e3df52a8a14aea9298fe6ec5bc113ed0d6d7922f31861727d54a43cbe29d&sd=20121119&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art3HL&cid=20220808Z1_NB&mid=DM1230245&rid=1570763271)** 

As of 2022, 19 states have legalized cannabis for adult use and the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp as a crop

As patients and the medical community embrace cannabis and CBD for pain relief, harm and even deaths from opioids will diminish

The existence of cannabinoid receptors in humans and other mammals, called the endocannabinoid system, gives clues to why cannabis and CBD affect so many body systems positively

Many industries, from Big Pharma to the alcohol, lumber, gas and oil and clothing industries, could lose profits from a booming cannabis industry
