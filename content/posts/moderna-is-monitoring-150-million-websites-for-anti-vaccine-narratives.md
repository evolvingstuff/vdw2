#### Moderna’s ‘Disinformation Department’ Monitors 150 Million Websites for ‘Anti-Vaccine’ Narratives

 **[Children's Health Defence](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/moderna-artificial-intelligence-anti-vaccine-narratives/?utm_source=luminate&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=defender&utm_id=20231121)** 

* "Moderna had never successfully advanced any product to market prior to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and was teetering on the edge of collapse when the pandemic was announced."

* "Its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine transformed the drugmaker into a $100 billion company almost overnight and turned its CEO, chairman and co-founders into billionaires."

* <span>[in 2023]</span> . . . as the COVID-19 booster uptake numbers have collapsed, Moderna and PGP launched a new collaboration, this time working with the American Board of Internal Medicine, to develop a training program called the “Infodemic Training Program,” to train healthcare workers to identify “medical misinformation.”
