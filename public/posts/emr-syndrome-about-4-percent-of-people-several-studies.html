Although symptoms can be serious, no underlying mechanism for EHS is known and there is no general cure or effective therapy. Here, we present the case study of a self-reported EHS patient whose symptoms include severe headaches, generalized fatigue, cardiac arrhythmia, attention and memory deficit, and generalized systemic pain within minutes of exposure to telecommunications (Wifi, cellular phones), high tension lines and electronic devices. Tests for cerebral, cardiovascular, and other physiological anomalies proved negative, as did serological tests for inflammation, allergies, infections, auto-immune conditions, and hormonal imbalance. However, further investigation revealed deficits in cellular anti-oxidants and increased radical scavenging enzymes, indicative of systemic oxidative stress.</p><p>Significantly, there was a large increase in circulating antibodies for oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDLox), byproducts of oxidative stress accumulating in membranes of vascular cells. Because a known primary effect of EMF exposure is to increase the concentration of cellular oxidants, we propose that pathology in this patient may be causally related to a resulting increase in LDLox synthesis. This in turn could trigger an exaggerated auto-immune response consistent with EHS symptoms. This case report thereby provides a testable mechanistic framework for EHS pathology with therapeutic implications for this debilitating and poorly understood condition.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/hypersensitivity-to-man-made-electromagnetic-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=electrohypersensitivity-as-a-newly-identified-and-characterized-neurologic-pathological-disorder-how-to-diagnose-treat-and-prevent-it---march-2020>Electrohypersensitivity as a Newly Identified and Characterized Neurologic Pathological Disorder: How to Diagnose, Treat, and Prevent It - March 2020</h4><p>Int.

EHS and MCS can be characterized clinically by a similar symptomatic picture, and biologically by low-grade inflammation and an autoimmune response involving autoantibodies against O-myelin.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>80% of the patients with EHS present with one, two, or three detectable oxidative stress biomarkers in their peripheral blood, meaning that overall these patients present with a true objective somatic disorder.</strong></p><p>Moreover, by using ultrasonic cerebral tomosphygmography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we showed that cases have a defect in the middle cerebral artery hemodynamics, and we localized a tissue pulsometric index deficiency in the capsulo-thalamic area of the temporal lobes, suggesting the involvement of the limbic system and the thalamus.</p><p>Altogether, these data <strong>strongly suggest that EHS is a neurologic pathological disorder which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented</strong> .

We have recently extended and confirmed our previous observation showing that EHS and MCS share clinically identical symptoms and may co-exist as a unique, common, sensitivity-related neurologic syndrome in 25% of the cases. There is presently no published biological study of these disorders, except the one we have previously published as preliminary. In the present study, we show that EHS and MCS and the combined syndrome share identical biochemical changes. More precisely, by measuring levels of peripheral blood and urine molecular biomarkers in a cohort of 2,018 consecutive cases, we show that both disorders and the combined syndrome can be objectively characterized, in about 90% of the cases, by a decrease in the production of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate in urine, while in 30-50% they are characterized by increased levels of histamine and of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and/or 70, and of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine in the peripheral blood. Increased levels of histamine and HSP are indicators of low grade inflammation while increased levels of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine are indicators of blood-brain barrier disruption/opening. In addition, we show that in about 15% of the cases anti-myelin autoantibodies can be detected in the peripheral blood, accounting for the occurrence of an autoimmune response. Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the biochemical tests are discussed, as well as the role of these indicators used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. We also discuss cases with undetectable biological change for which they can be nevertheless diagnosed by cerebral neurotransmitters analysis in urine and brain imaging. On the basis of these biological data it is suggested that EHS and/or MCS are new brain disorders, generated via a common etiopathogenic mechanism.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/molecular-biomarkers-in-electrohypersensitivity.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=3-to-7-of-people-have-electromagnetic-hypersensitivity>3% to 7% of people have Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity</h4><p><strong>Prevalence of Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Comprehensive Analysis</strong></p><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/approximately-what-of-the-popu-yPBLZC8gT1.py1YCPHGx.g>Perplexity AI - Deep Research April 2025</a></strong></p><p>The prevalence of electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) and related conditions varies significantly across populations, studies, and terminology.
