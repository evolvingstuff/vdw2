|  | Magnesium<br> in liter of water | % of RDA if drink 2 liter/day |
| San Francisco, Ca | 4 mg | 2.4% |
| Bodega Bay, Ca | 40 mg | 25% |** 

 **Of the 269 subjects** 

73%  <  30 ng/mL, 

44 % trigger point tenderness

30% both low D and trigger point ==> 10X risk of Cancer

48% low D or trigger point

13% no problem (D>30 ng and no trigger point)

 **Conclusion bullet points** 

* “Having both total serum 25(OH)D deficiency and myofascial pain assessed by tender trigger points showed a significant association with cancer, adenomatous colon polyps, and tendon rupture. “

* They use trigger point pain as a proxy for low Magnesium in the body
