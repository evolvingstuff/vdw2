#### The Mediating Role of Vitamin D in the Association Between Personality and Memory: Evidence from Two Samples

Biol Psychol. 2023 Feb 18;108525. [doi: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2023.108525](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2023.108525) PDF is behind a paywall

Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality traits are consistently related to cognition in old age. However, little is known about the biological mediators of this association. The present study examined whether levels of Vitamin D mediated the association between personality and memory. Participants were adults aged 50 to 96 years from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, N= 5,229) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA, N= 4,249). In HRS, personality and demographic factors were assessed in 2012/2014, Vitamin D was assessed in 2016, and memory was assessed in 2018. In ELSA, personality and demographic factors were obtained in 2010/2011, Vitamin D was measured in 2012/2013, and memory was assessed in 2014/2015. 

 **In both samples, higher extraversion and conscientiousness were related to higher levels of Vitamin D, whereas higher neuroticism was related to lower Vitamin D.** 

In both samples, higher Vitamin D partly mediated the association between both higher extraversion and conscientiousness and better memory. The association between higher neuroticism and worse memory at follow-up was partially mediated by lower Vitamin D in the HRS and ELSA. Vitamin D did not mediate the association between higher openness and better memory. The present study extends the personality-cognition literature by providing new replicable evidence that Vitamin D is a biological mediator.
