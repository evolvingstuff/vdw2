Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between low vitamin D levels and the severity and recurrence of CDI.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A retrospective case-control study evaluated patients hospitalized between 2007 and 2013 with CDI and a positive C. difficile toxin assay.</p><p><strong>Severe complicated CD</strong> was defined based on (1) laboratory or radiological criteria correlated clinically and (2) sepsis requiring intensive care unit admission. Recurrent CDI (RCDI) was defined as a new episode of diarrhea occurring within 90 days of resolution of the initial episode for at least 10 days after discontinuing therapy and confirmed by positive stool C. difficile toxin assay or polymerase chain reaction. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on vitamin D level (ng/mL): severely deficient (&lt;10), insufficient (10-19.9), predeficient (20-29.9), and control group (≥30).</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Two hundred seventy-one patients were diagnosed with CDI, of which 48 had RCDI distributed as 5 (12.5%), 15 (16.1%), 10 (15.6%), and 13 (17.5%) patients in each of the aforementioned groups, respectively (P= 0.55). Severe complicated CDI was identified in 7 (17.5%), 17 (18.2%), 9 (14%), and 3 (4%) patients, respectively (P = 0.04). Thirty-day mortality was 1 of 40, 1 of 93, 2 of 64, and 2 of 74 patients, respectively (P = 0.43).</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:</p><p>Normal vitamin D level has a protective effect against severe CDI, and low vitamin D is associated with greater severity of CDI but not with an increased risk of RCDI or 30-day mortality.</p><hr><h4 id=clostridium-difficile-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-6-days-vs-4-days-of-diarrhea-and-almost-2x-more-sepsis---jan-2015>Clostridium difficile associated with low vitamin D, 6 days vs 4 days of diarrhea and almost 2X more sepsis - Jan 2015</h4><p><strong>Prolonged Clostridium difficile Infection May Be Associated With Vitamin D Deficiency.</strong></p><p>JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr. 2015 Jan 26. pii: 0148607114568121</p><p>Wong KK1, Lee R2, Watkins RR3, Haller N4.</p><p>Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections, creating a financial burden for the U.S. healthcare system.

All patients had 25(OH)D levels measured before hospitalization and were at risk for HACDI (defined as the presence of C difficile toxin A or B in stool samples obtained >48 hours after hospitalization).

Vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> has immune modulatory effects and plays an important role in intestinal immunity. The role of vitamin D in CA-CDI has not been examined previously.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>This was a single referral center case-control study. Cases comprised of all patients with CA-CDI who had a serum 25(OH)D measured within 12 months prior to infection. Controls were drawn from patients who had 25(OH)D checked and matched based on age, gender, race and health status. Serum 25(OH)D was stratified as &lt; 15 ng/mL, 15-30 ng/mL or > 30 ng/mL. Regression models adjusting for potential confounders were used to define independent association between vitamin D and CA-CDI.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>We identified 58 matched case-control pairs (66% women; 85% Caucasian). The mean age was 62 years. The mean serum 25(OH)D level was significantly lower in CA-CDI cases compared to controls (28.5 ng/mL vs. 33.8 ng/mL, p = 0.046). Cases had higher rate of antibiotic exposure and more comorbidity.</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D &lt; 15 ng/mL was associated with an increased risk of CA-CDI on univariate (Odds ratio (OR) 5.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 - 17.24) and multivariate analysis (OR 3.84, 95% CI 1.10 - 13.42).

Low vitamin D levels are known to impair immune responses to infection and are associated with increased mortality. We compared the role of patient comorbidity measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) with vitamin D levels to ascertain whether vitamin D levels were an independent variable affecting the outcome of CDAD or a marker of overall comorbidity.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A prospective cohort study studied 62 patients hospitalized between 2008 and 2009 with manifestations of CDAD and a positive C. difficile toxin assay. All patients received standard antibiotics (metronidazole and/or vancomycin). Their status at 30-day follow up was classified as resolved or recurred/expired. Patients&rsquo; CCI was calculated using their medical history. Logistic regression analysis of variables including 25-hydroxyvitamin D, CCI, age, gender, white blood cell count (WBC), albumin and residence type were performed.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>There were 62 patients (43.6% men, 56.4% women) with CDAD; mean age was 75 ± 17 years. At 30-day follow up, 28 (45.2%) expired, 10 (16.1%) had persistent or recurrent diarrhea and 24 (38.7%) resolved. Nonresolution was seen in 38 (61.3%). There was no significant association between 30-day resolution status and CCI, gender, WBC, albumin level or residence type.

Recent studies have provided some evidence of an association between hypovitaminosis D and the risk of CDI. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to pool all the existing evidence to investigate the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) and CDI.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A systematic search was conducted in 3 databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Sciences) for epidemiological studies that examined the association between mean 25(OH)D concentrations and CDI as well as between 25(OH)D status and CDI severity or recurrence. 25(OH)D status was defined as &ldquo;lower&rdquo; or &ldquo;higher&rdquo; at a threshold concentration of &lt;20 or ≥20 ng/mL, respectively. Pooled effect sizes were computed using the inverse variance heterogeneity model of meta-analysis.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Eight publications (n = 4479 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The mean concentration of 25(OH)D in patients with CDI was 3.54 ng/mL (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.39-6.89 ng/mL) lower than in patients without CDI.
