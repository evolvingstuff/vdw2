#### Smoking is 36 Times Worse Than Working at a Nuclear Reactor

 **[Green Med March 2012](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/radiation-found-be-1-cause-tobacco-related-cancer1?utm_source=Daily+Greenmedinfo.com+Email+List&utm_campaign=e4fba9c139-smoking&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_193c8492fb-e4fba9c139-86748089&ct=t(smoking)&mc_cid=e4fba9c139&mc_eid=87994ab051)** 

* “In 1998, major tobacco industries' internal secret documents were made available online by the Master Settlement Agreement, revealing that the industry was aware of the presence of a radioactive substance in tobacco as early as 1959.”

* “According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the industry's and our estimate of long-term lung rad of alpha particles causes 120-138 lung cancer deaths per year per 1,000 regular smokers.”

* “Polonium 210 is extraordinarily toxic when ingested or inhaled. In fact, it is 4500 times more toxic than radium 226….”

#### Polonium, Tobacco - Wikipedia

 **[Polonium, Tobacco at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium#Tobacco) March 2019** 

* Polonium-210 in tobacco contributes to many of the cases of lung cancer worldwide. Most of this polonium is derived from lead-210 deposited on tobacco leaves from the atmosphere; the lead-210 is a product of radon-222 gas, much of which appears to originate from the decay of radium-226 from fertilizers applied to the tobacco soils.

* The presence of polonium in tobacco smoke has been known since the early 1960s. Some of the world's biggest tobacco firms researched ways to remove the substance—to no avail—over a 40-year period. The results were never published.

#### Health effects of tobacco – Wikipedia

 **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_tobacco) March 2019** 

* “Tobacco use is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally”

* “As many as half of people who use tobacco die from complications of tobacco use. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year tobacco causes about 6 million deaths (about 10% of all deaths) with 600,000 of these occurring in non smokers due to second hand smoke”

* “Some of the mineral apatite in Florida used to produce phosphate for U.S.A. tobacco crops contains uranium, radium, lead-210 and polonium-210 and radon”

* “According to previous research, smoking 1 1/2 packs of cigarettes per day can expose your bronchial epithelium to a radiation dose equivalent to a radiation dose to your skin from  **300 chest x-rays per year** ”
