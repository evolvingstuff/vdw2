 **Highlights** 

* Role of VDR in physiology and disease necessitates understanding of its regulation.

* We reviewed the regulation of VDR by environment, genetics and epigenetics.

* Epigenetic mechanisms regulating VDR: DNA methylation, histone modification, ncRNA.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays a pivotal role as a mediator of 1α,25(OH)2D signalling. Besides its role in calcium homeostasis, ligand- bound VDR supports immunity and cell cycle control. While VDR regulates numerous genes across the genome, much remains to be learned about the regulation of the VDR gene itself. Hindered VDR expression and function have a broad impact, contributing to diverse diseases, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and tuberculosis. 

A better understanding of the three main factors regulating the VDR, namely environment, genetics and epigenetics, may facilitate the development of improved strategies for treatment and prevention of diseases associated with impaired VDR function. 

This review aims to illuminate the complex interaction and contributions of the three levels of VDR gene regulation to endorse consideration of all three regulatory factors when studying gene regulation.
