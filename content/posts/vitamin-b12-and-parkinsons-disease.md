#### Low Vitamin B12 and Parkinson Disease – May 2019

 **Potential Link to Reduced Cholinergic Transmission and Severity of Disease** 

Mayo Clinic COMMENTARY, ISSUE 5, P757-762, MAY 01, 2019 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2019.01.039

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by prominent motor dysfunction including rest tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity responsive to levodopa. However, postural instability, freezing of gait, and cognitive impairment are important non–levodopa-responsive symptoms of PD and are significant risk factors for falls, leading to hospitalization, disability, and death.1 Treatments for key nonmotor symptoms of PD that might improve cognitive decline and postural instability are currently a major gap in PD therapeutics.

Dysfunction of the cholinergic systems in PD is thought to possibly play a contributory role in postural instability and cognitive impairment. Therefore, modulation of cholinergic transmission could improve balance and cognition in these patients.1 Vitamin B12 is lower in patients with PD compared with controls, and low levels have been associated with peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and more rapid rate of disease progression in PD.2,  3,  4 Although this relationship does not necessarily mean causality, there are several hypothetical mechanisms by which reduced vitamin B12 may lead to reduced availability of choline as a substrate for cholinergic transmission. Here we will review the proposed pathophysiology of nonmotor symptoms in PD and the potential relationship between vitamin B12 and acetylcholine metabolism. We propose that vitamin B12 supplementation could be considered as an adjuvant approach to improve cholinergic transmission and, potentially, motor and cognitive function in patients with PD.
