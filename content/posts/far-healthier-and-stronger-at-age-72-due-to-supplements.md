#### Personal observation by the founder of VitaminDWiki

I noticed my health improve with each added supplement

Vitamin D for 8+ years (~100 ng)

Good intake of Magnesium and Vitamin K for 6 years

Vectomega brand of Omega-3 for 4+ years (tested)- previously had taken Coromega brand for a decade

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While my health had improved a lot, I felt that I was not getting the full vitamin D benefit

 **A poor Vitamin D Receptor will limit the benefits of Vitamin D** 

 **48**  diseases were strongly associated with the [9 ways to improve the Vitamin D Receptor](/tags/9-ways-to-improve-the-vitamin-d-receptor.html)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  As of 2 years ago I use 8 of the ways (the 9th requires a prescription)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Receptor aids = Resveratrol, Quercitin, Magnesium, Intense Exercise, Zinc, UV</span>** 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 **Have biked for 40+ years, but <span style="color:#F00;">started adding weights</span> to my bike after improving Vitamin D Receptor** 

Have clamped a total of 30 lbs onto my 25 lb bike: 6 lbs at a time (using window sash weights)

I keep increasing my cardiovascular system (VO2), and need more weights to get a intense exercise on steep hills

I also use an exercycle - getting 2 sets of intense exercise in 25 minutes every 2nd day

My exercycle exercise provides more intensity than I could ever get on my 2 wheel bike - might have fallen off

[Bulk supplements](/posts/bulk-supplementation-of-vitamin-d-magnesium-zinc-b-12-k2-boron-etc-lower-cost-and-easier-than-pills) which I take (no pills) 

I  add all of my supplements as a powder to granola which I prepare every 10 days.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus I do not have to remember to take any of my supplements daily

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Improving my Vitamin D Receptor costs ~3 cents per day
