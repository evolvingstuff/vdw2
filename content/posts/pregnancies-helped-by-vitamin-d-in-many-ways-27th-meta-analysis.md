Background/objectives

Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may influence adverse outcomes in offspring. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was to assess the association between low prenatal concentrations of 25(OH)D (by using three different cut-off levels), preterm birth (PTB) and anthropometric and neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring.

Subjects/methods

Studies reporting data on the association between maternal vitamin D concentrations and offspring outcomes identified through a systematic review of scientific literature published in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library databases up to April 2017.

Results

We included 54 eligible studies. Vitamin D-deficient mothers ( **<30 nmol/L** ) had offspring with *lower birthweight (MD −87.82 g; 95% CI −119.73, −55.91 g), 

* (smaller) head circumference (MD −0.19 cm; 95% CI −0.32, −0.06 cm) and a 

* higher risk of small for gestational age (SGA) infants and 

* PTB (OR 1.59; 95% CI 1.24, 2.03) 

compared to mothers with concentrations ≥30 nmol/L. 

Vitamin D insufficiency ( **<50 nmol/L** ) was associated with a 

* higher risk of SGA (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.08, 1.91 and 

higher risk of PTB OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.08, 1.52

Concentrations of 25(OH)D ≥75 nmol/L were not found to be associated with birthweight, SGA or PTB. 

Offspring of vitamin D-insufficient mothers had lower scores in 

* mental (MD −1.12 points; 95% CI −1.82, −0.42 cm) and 

* language developmental tests (MD −0.35 points; 95% CI −1.00, 0.31 cm).

Conclusion

Maternal vitamin D deficiency is associated with offspring adverse anthropometric outcomes and PTB; insufficiency with a higher risk of SGA, PTB and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.
