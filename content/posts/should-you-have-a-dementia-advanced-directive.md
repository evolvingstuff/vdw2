#### Basically asks the following 3 questions for mild, moderate and severe stages of dementia

1. To live for as long as I could. I would want full efforts to prolong my life, including efforts to restart my heart if it stops beating.

1. To only receive care in the place where I am living. I would not want to go to the hospital even if I were very ill. 

1. To receive comfort-oriented care only, focused on relieving my suffering such as pain, anxiety, or breathlessness
