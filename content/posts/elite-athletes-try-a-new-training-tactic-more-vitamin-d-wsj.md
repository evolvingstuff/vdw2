 **Subtitle: Pro and college teams, including the Steelers, Red Wings and USC, think the nutrient may help players avoid injury, among other benefits** 

* "A 2011 study of the New York Giants, presented at a meeting of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, found an association between low vitamin D levels and injuries. "

* "Ms. McDowell aims to get her hockey players’ vitamin D levels between 40 and 80 nanograms per milliliter. "

* "One study, of more than 5,000 female U.S. Navy recruits, found a 20% drop in stress fractures after recruits received doses of calcium and vitamin D."

* "Even the University of Southern California, where sunshine abounds, checks its varsity athletes’ vitamin D levels annually. Despite all that sun, more than one-third of 223 USC athletes tested for a study published in 2015 had insufficient vitamin D levels."

* "The USC study, along with those of the Giants and Steelers, showed African-American athletes tend to have lower vitamin D levels. "
