## What is the relationship between UV B and global incidence rates of colorectal cancer?

Dermato-Endocinology Volume 5, Issue 1   February/March 2013

Authors: Raphael E. Cuomo, Sharif B. Mohr, Edward D. Gorham and Cedric F. Garland

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between UV B and global incidence of colorectal cancer, while controlling for relevant covariates. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between latitude and incidence rates of colon cancer in 173 countries. Multiple linear regression was employed to investigate the relationship between UVB dose and colorectal cancer rates while controlling for per capita intake of energy from animal sources, per capita health expenditure, pigmentation, and life expectancy. Data on all variables were available for  **139 countries** . Incidence of colon cancer was highest in countries distant from the equator (R2 = 0.50, p < 0.0001). UV B dose (p < 0.0001) was independently, inversely associated with incidence rates of colorectal cancer after controlling for intake of energy from animal sources, per capita health expenditure, pigmentation, and life expectancy (R2 for overall model = 0.76, p < 0.0001). Consistent with previous research, UVB was inversely associated with incidence of colon cancer. Further research on vitamin D and prevention of colon cancer in individuals should be conducted, including studies of higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than have been studied to date.

### Global vitamin D levels in relation to age, gender, skin pigmentation and latitude: an ecologic meta-regression analysis

We performed a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies on serum 25(OH)D status globally. Serum 25(OH)D levels on average were 54 nmol/l, were higher in women than men, and higher in Caucasians than in non-Caucasians. There was no trend in serum 25(OH)D level with latitude. Vitamin D deficiency was widespread.

Introduction: We studied vitamin D status (expressed as serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>) in native subjects worldwide.

Methods: Meta-analysis and meta-regression of studies reporting on 25(OH)D in healthy subjects retrieved from Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science using the terms “serum”, “25-hydroxy-vitamin D”, “cholecalciferol”, and “human”. A total of 394 studies were included.

Results: The mean 25(OH)D level was 54 nmol/l (95% CI: 52–57 nmol/l). Women had borderline significantly higher 25(OH)D levels than men, and Caucasians had higher levels than non-Caucasians. 25(OH)D levels were higher in subjects aged >15 years than in younger subjects. Unadjusted there was no significant decrease in 25(OH)D with latitude (slope of curve −0.03 ± 0.12 nmol/l per degree latitude north or south of equator, p = 0.8). There was a significant decline with latitude for Caucasians (−0.69 ± 0.30 nmol/l per degree, p = 0.02), but not for non-Caucasians (0.03 ± 0.39 nmol/l per degree, p = 0.14). After adjustment for age, gender, and ethnicity, no overall correlation was present between 25(OH)D and latitude (−0.29 ± 0.24 nmol/l per degree, p = 0.23).

Conclusion: There was no overall influence of latitude on 25(OH)D. 

However, in separate analyses 25(OH)D decreased with latitude in Caucasians but not in non-Caucasians. 

A widespread global vitamin D insufficiency was present compared with proposed threshold levels.
