#### Has a High Dose of Vitamin D3 Impacted Health Conditions in Older Adults?-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Focusing on Dose 100,000 IU

Nutrients. 2024 Jan 14;16(2):252. [doi: 10.3390/nu16020252.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16020252.)

'T = tested group, C = Control group, DB = double blind, OL = open label, 

RCT = randomized clinical trial, NA = not available, 

QE = quasiexperimental, BD = bone density, BP = blood pressure, 

COPD = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,

   * 100,000 IU vitamin D was administered for patients allocated into OL RCT and DB RCT;

Background: Older adults are prone to vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency, which may impair their health. A high dose of VD3 (HDVD3 = 100,000 IU) could improve their 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level and health outcomes. However, evidence for such a beneficial effect of HDVD3 in older adults coming from clinical trials is mixed.

Objective: To review the literature on the efficacy of a single dose of 100,000 IU of VD3 in older people.

Methods: We searched PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, and NIH's clinical trials registry for clinical studies on the effect of a single high dose of VD3 on various health outcomes in older people. We also performed a meta-analysis using the standardized mean difference to assess the effect of VD3 on its blood level. Due to expected high heterogeneity, its amount (i.e., tau2) was estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird estimator. To estimate tau2, the Q-test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic were calculated.

Results: Search results identify 13 studies that reported diverse health outcomes, such as lung and cardiovascular function, skin cancer progression, intensive care unit mortality, immune system response, and bone density. The meta-analysis showed a significant increase in 25(OH)D blood levels after treatment in 10 studies, with an average standardized mean difference of 2.60 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.07 to 3.13). Their results suggested that a single high dose of VD3 may benefit intensive care unit patients and skin cancer patients in remission. However, evidence for other beneficial health effects of HDVD3 was mixed due to high heterogeneity among studies.

Conclusions: A single high dose of VD3 may positively affect some health outcomes in older people, possibly due to its pleiotropic and immunomodulatory effects. However, the evidence needs to be more extensive and consistent, and more rigorous studies are required to confirm the benefits and safety of VD3 high doses in older patients.

Background: Older adults are prone to vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency, which may impair their health. A high dose of VD3 (HDVD3 = 100,000 IU) could improve their 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D] level and health outcomes. However, evidence for such a beneficial effect of HDVD3 in older adults coming from clinical trials is mixed.

Objective: To review the literature on the efficacy of a single dose of 100,000 IU of VD3 in older people.

Methods: We searched PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, and NIH&#39;s clinical trials registry for clinical studies on the effect of a single high dose of VD3 on various health outcomes in older people. We also performed a meta-analysis using the standardized mean difference to assess the effect of VD3 on its blood level. Due to expected high heterogeneity, its amount (i.e., tau2) was estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird estimator. To estimate tau2, the Q-test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic were calculated.

Results: Search results identify 13 studies that reported diverse health outcomes, such as lung and cardiovascular function, skin cancer progression, intensive care unit mortality, immune system response, and bone density. The meta-analysis showed a significant increase in 25(OH)D blood levels after treatment in 10 studies, with an average standardized mean difference of 2.60 ng/mL (95% CI: 2.07 to 3.13). Their results suggested that a single high dose of VD3 may benefit intensive care unit patients and skin cancer patients in remission. However, evidence for other beneficial health effects of HDVD3 was mixed due to high heterogeneity among studies.

Conclusions: A single high dose of VD3 may positively affect some health outcomes in older people, possibly due to its pleiotropic and immunomodulatory effects. However, the evidence needs to be more extensive and consistent, and more rigorous studies are required to confirm the benefits and safety of VD3 high doses in older patients.
