Nevertheless, its relationship with non-infectious uveitis (NIU), an inflammatory ocular disorder, remains inconclusive.</p><p>Methods</p><p>A systematic search was conducted in three databases from database inception until May 8, 2023, to investigate the potential relationship between vitamin D deficiency and NIU. We included observational studies reporting the measurement of vitamin D levels in patients with NIU and healthy controls without restriction of language or date of publication. Three pairs of authors independently screened the title and abstracts for potential eligibility and then in full text. A third author resolved disagreements. Three pairs of independent reviewers abstracted the data from the fully reviewed records and evaluated the risk of bias. We followed The MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines. Random effects meta-analyses were used for primary analysis. Studies not included in the meta-analysis were summarized descriptively. This review was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42022308105.</p><p>Findings</p><p>Of 933 records screened, 11 studies were included, and five were meta-analyzed, encompassing 354 cases and 5728 controls (mean participant age ranging from 7.1 to 58.9 years). Patients with vitamin D deficiency exhibited an Odds Ratio of 2.04 (95% CI = 1.55–2.68, P &lt; 0.00001) for developing NIU compared to controls. Overall, potential sources of bias were low across most studies.</p><p>Interpretation</p><p>Our findings suggest that vitamin D may play an essential role in the pathophysiology of NIU. While the included studies demonstrated generally low potential bias, additional rigorous prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings and further elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Vitamin D supplementation could represent a possible therapeutic strategy for preventing or managing NIU if substantiated. Clinicians should consider screening for and addressing vitamin D deficiency in patients with or at risk for NIU.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/uveitis-meta-feb-2024-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=chronic-anterior-uveitis-2x-less-likely-if-happened-to-be-taking-vitamin-d---nov-2024>Chronic Anterior Uveitis 2X less likely if happened to be taking Vitamin D - Nov 2024</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Supplementation and Remission from Chronic Anterior Uveitis</strong></p><p>Ocul Immunol Inflamm. 2024 Nov 25:1-4. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2024.2427857>doi: 10.1080/09273948.2024.2427857</a> <span style=color:red>$65 paywall</span></p><p>Hueyjong Shih 1 2, Yineng Chen 3, Katie Huynh 1 2, Eric B Suhler 4 5, Jennifer E Thorne 6 7, Nirali P Bhatt 8, C Stephen Foster 9, Douglas A Jabs 6 7, Grace A Levy-Clarke 10, Robert B Nussenblatt 11, James T Rosenbaum 4 12 13, H Nida Sen 14 15, Sapna S Gangaputra 16, Abhishek R Payal 17, Hosne Begum 6, Naira Khachatryan 8, Sherri-Ann M Burnett-Bowie 18, Gui-Shuang Ying 3, John H Kempen 1 2 19 20 21, Lucia Sobrin 1 2</p><p>Purpose: Chronic anterior uveitis (CAU) often requires suppressive therapy, which has potential side effects including cataract, ocular hypertension, and increased risk of infection. No remittive therapy is currently available; however, several studies have demonstrated an association between low 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25OHD) levels and either uveitis incidence or uveitis disease activity. This study investigates the potential of Vitamin D supplementation as a remittive treatment for CAU.</p><p>Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Disease (SITE) cohort study, which included patients with ocular inflammatory disease seen at U.S. tertiary centers between 1979 and 2010. Vitamin D supplementation data was analyzed for patients with CAU. Eyes were considered in remission if they remained quiet for at least 90 days off all anti-inflammatory treatment for eye disease.</p><p>Results: Among 2688 patients who never used Vitamin D, the cumulative adjusted CAU remission incidence was 13.5% at the 16-month follow-up. In contrast, among 75 patients who used Vitamin D for a duration of ≤1 year, the cumulative adjusted CAU remission incidence was 28% at 16 months. The use of Vitamin D was associated with a <strong>crude hazard ratio for remission of 2.14</strong> <span>[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-3.71, p = 0.0071]</span>, and an adjusted hazard ratio for remission of 2.43 <span>[95% CI: 1.36-4.33, p = 0.0027]</span>.</p><p>Conclusion: In the SITE Cohort, Vitamin D supplementation is associated with a significantly increased incidence of remission. Vitamin D supplementation should be explored in a prospective trial as the next step of evaluation.</p><hr><h4 id=uveitis-noninfectious-5x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-deficient---meta-analysis-june-2024>Uveitis (noninfectious) 5X more likely if vitamin D deficient - meta-analysis June 2024</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Levels in Patients with Noninfectious Uveitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</strong></p><p>Ocular Immunology and Inflammation <a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2024.2367676>https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2024.2367676</a> <span style=color:red>$65 paywall</span></p><p>Dillan Cunha Amaral , MSORCID Icon,Rafael Takahashi , MSORCID Icon,Henrique Maciel Vieira de Moraes , MD, PhDORCID Icon,Márcio Penha Morterá Rodrigues , MD, PhDORCID Icon,Adroaldo de Alencar Costa Filho , MD, PhDORCID Icon,Haroldo Vieira de Moraes Junior , MD, PhDORCID Icon</p><p>Purpose</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with higher rates of autoimmune disease, including noninfectious uveitis.

The outcomes of interest were vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D mean level, vitamin D supplementation, and smoking rates. A subgroup analysis of inactive uveitis and active uveitis was performed.

We review published data on the relationship between uveitis and vitamin D levels or vitamin D-associated gene polymorphisms. A search of the PubMed and Medline databases was conducted to identify relevant articles concerning vitamin D and uveitis. Sixteen studies were included in this review, and the evidence they present, linking low vitamin D levels with uveitis, is compelling. The uveitic entities shown to be modulated by hypovitaminosis D include, but are not limited to, HLA-B27-associated acute anterior uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, sarcoidosis-associated uveitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. Specific polymorphisms of vitamin D family genes were found to correlate with uveitis in ankylosing spondylitis, Behçet&rsquo;s disease, VKH, and HLA B27-positive patients. Further understanding of the role of vitamin D, a known regulator of inflammatory processes, in noninfectious uveitis may advance capabilities in the fields of disease prevention and treatment.</p><hr><h4 id=is-uveitis-a-type-of-eye-infection-asked-perplexity-ai-nov-2024httpswwwperplexityaisearchis-uvelitis-a-type-of-eye-infe-10jwvfybru2htohuhda09q>is Uveitis a type of eye infection?
