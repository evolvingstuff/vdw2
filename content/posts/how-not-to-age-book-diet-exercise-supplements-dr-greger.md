* Become aware that there are many very low-cost ways to increase lifespan and healthspan

* No longer will try to increase protein in a meal (500 occurrences in the book)

* Start reducing Sodium by using our salt which is half Potassium Chloride

* Reduce fish intake - polluted by Mercury, plastics, and chemicals.

* Reduce eating chips, and get back to gluten-free bread-making

* Investigate Spermidine (a new topic for me, mentioned 155 times in the book)

* Will no longer have milk with my chocolate or blueberries - it cancels the health benefits

  * Spermidine increases [autophagy and lifespan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rikOpH6_TgE&ab_channel=ModernHealthspan) (video)

  * "Researchers looked at 146 different nutrients in their diet, and the component most predictive of longevity was spermidine."

  * two cents per mg. from wheat germ page 36, need about 20 mg/day

#### Is Aging a Disease? -3 minute video by Greger Jan 2024

 **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUft_PH00g&ab_channel=NutritionFacts.org)** 

For decades, one of the most contested questions in gerontology has been whether or not aging itself should be considered a disease. But aging is natural, the counterargument goes; so, it can’t be a disease. Yes, but so is getting an infection, and we call that a disease. But aging is universal. Yes, but everybody gets the common cold too.

If you ask people whether they think a variety of conditions should be classified as diseases, you get an odd mix. For example, alcohol dependence is considered a disease, but nicotine dependence is not. Interestingly, the lay public is more likely to view aging as a disease than doctors, despite medicine’s historical penchant to medicalize everything. Who could forget drapetomania, the mental “illness” afflicting slaves who escaped plantations? Masturbation was considered a disease, complete with grizzly surgical solutions. Homosexuality was officially labeled a disease within my lifetime. Yet, medicine is hesitant to label aging an ailment.

What does it matter what we call it? A rose by any other name wilts just as fast. The hope is that disease classification would lead to greater resource allocation for aging research, just as the recent declaration of obesity as a disease did for obesity research. Aging is arguably one of the most important unsolved problems of humanity, yet less than  **0.1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget is spent on understanding the aging process)). Even though aging may be the leading cause of disease and death,

* only four out of 14 general medicine textbooks have a chapter on the subject, and

* five of 14 didn’t appear to address aging at all. 

he science of aging appears to have been “relegated to a limbo reserved for impractical projects or eccentric whims not quite worthy of serious scientiﬁc … consideration.”

Why doesn’t Big Pharma invest in what would certainly be a blockbuster drug? Why spend the money on research when it can be spent marketing all the unproven anti-aging products they already sell? Many of the leading lines of dietary supplements are owned by drug companies. They’re the ones selling “cosmeceuticals” and “age reverse” skin creams. Drug maker Sanofi even partnered with Coca-Cola to come up with a “beauty drink.” They’re already making money hand over fist preying on the public’s gullibility and desperation for anti-aging products. Why waste valuable marketing money on proving anything actually works?

What does it matter what we call it? A rose by any other name wilts just as fast. The hope is that disease classification would lead to greater resource allocation for aging research, just as the recent declaration of obesity as a disease did for obesity research. Aging is arguably one of the most important unsolved problems of humanity, yet less than  **0.1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget is spent on understanding the aging process)). Even though aging may be the leading cause of disease and death,

* only four out of 14 general medicine textbooks have a chapter on the subject, and

* five of 14 didn’t appear to address aging at all. 

he science of aging appears to have been “relegated to a limbo reserved for impractical projects or eccentric whims not quite worthy of serious scientiﬁc … consideration.”

Why doesn’t Big Pharma invest in what would certainly be a blockbuster drug? Why spend the money on research when it can be spent marketing all the unproven anti-aging products they already sell? Many of the leading lines of dietary supplements are owned by drug companies. They’re the ones selling “cosmeceuticals” and “age reverse” skin creams. Drug maker Sanofi even partnered with Coca-Cola to come up with a “beauty drink.” They’re already making money hand over fist preying on the public’s gullibility and desperation for anti-aging products. Why waste valuable marketing money on proving anything actually works?

!!!!!!Some of the ways that the video changed the founder of VitaminDWiki
*Become aware that there are many very low-cost ways to increase lifespan and healthspan
*No longer will try to increase protein in a meal (500 occurrences in the book)
*Start reducing Sodium by using our salt which is half Potassium Chloride
*Reduce fish intake - polluted by Mercury, plastics, and chemicals.
*Reduce eating chips, and get back to gluten-free bread-making
*Investigate Spermidine (a new topic for me, mentioned 155 times in the book)
*Will no longer have milk with my chocolate or blueberries - it cancels the health benefits
**Spermidine increases [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rikOpH6_TgE&amp;ab_channel=ModernHealthspan|autophagy and lifespan] (video)
**&quot;Researchers looked at 146 different nutrients in their diet, and the component most predictive of longevity was spermidine.&quot;
**two cents per mg. from wheat germ page 36, need about 20 mg/day
Greger, M.D., Michael, FACLM. How Not to Age: The Scientific Approach to Getting Healthier as You Get Older (p. 35). Flatiron Books. Kindle Edition.
*Reduce use of Resveratrol - which increases brain problems (mentioned 99 times in the book)
*Investigate Flax seed

!!!!Is Aging a Disease? -3 minute video by Greger Jan 2024
__[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plUft_PH00g&amp;ab_channel=NutritionFacts.org|YouTube]__
For decades, one of the most contested questions in gerontology has been whether or not aging itself should be considered a disease. But aging is natural, the counterargument goes; so, it can’t be a disease. Yes, but so is getting an infection, and we call that a disease. But aging is universal. Yes, but everybody gets the common cold too.

If you ask people whether they think a variety of conditions should be classified as diseases, you get an odd mix. For example, alcohol dependence is considered a disease, but nicotine dependence is not. Interestingly, the lay public is more likely to view aging as a disease than doctors, despite medicine’s historical penchant to medicalize everything. Who could forget drapetomania, the mental “illness” afflicting slaves who escaped plantations? Masturbation was considered a disease, complete with grizzly surgical solutions. Homosexuality was officially labeled a disease within my lifetime. Yet, medicine is hesitant to label aging an ailment.

What does it matter what we call it? A rose by any other name wilts just as fast. The hope is that disease classification would lead to greater resource allocation for aging research, just as the recent declaration of obesity as a disease did for obesity research. Aging is arguably one of the most important unsolved problems of humanity, yet less than __0.1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget is spent on understanding the aging process)). Even though aging may be the leading cause of disease and death,
*only four out of 14 general medicine textbooks have a chapter on the subject, and
*five of 14 didn’t appear to address aging at all. 
he science of aging appears to have been “relegated to a limbo reserved for impractical projects or eccentric whims not quite worthy of serious scientiﬁc … consideration.”

Why doesn’t Big Pharma invest in what would certainly be a blockbuster drug? Why spend the money on research when it can be spent marketing all the unproven anti-aging products they already sell? Many of the leading lines of dietary supplements are owned by drug companies. They’re the ones selling “cosmeceuticals” and “age reverse” skin creams. Drug maker Sanofi even partnered with Coca-Cola to come up with a “beauty drink.” They’re already making money hand over fist preying on the public’s gullibility and desperation for anti-aging products. Why waste valuable marketing money on proving anything actually works?
