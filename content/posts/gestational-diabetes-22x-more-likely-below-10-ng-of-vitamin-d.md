OBJECTIVE:

We examined the association of second-trimester maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) during pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

STUDY DESIGN:

Among 1314 pregnant women who participated in Project Viva, a birth cohort study, we measured 25(OH)D levels at 26-28 weeks gestation during GDM screening using a 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test.

RESULTS:

We found 25(OH)D levels of <25 nmol/L in 44 of 1087 women (4.0%) with normal glucose tolerance, 9 of 159 women (5.7%) with impaired glucose tolerance, and 9 of 68 women (13.2%) with GDM. 

Analyses that were adjusted for sociodemographics, season, maternal body mass index, gestational weight gain, and dietary factors suggested that women with 25(OH)D levels of <25 vs ?25 nmol/L may have higher odds of experiencing GDM (odds ratio,  **2.2** ; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-5.5). Glucose levels after the glucose challenge test were associated inversely with 25(OH)D levels (P < .01).

CONCLUSION:

Second-trimester 25(OH)D levels were associated inversely with glucose levels after 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test; low 25(OH)D levels may be associated with increased risk of GDM.
