Background: The relative potency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to vitamin D3 needs to be better defined so that food-composition tables can better reflect the true vitamin D nutritive value of certain foods.

Objective: We performed a randomized, controlled intervention study in apparently healthy, free-living adults to investigate whether the intake of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 is 5 times more potent in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> during winter compared with an equivalent amount of vitamin D3.

Design: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study was conducted in adults aged ?50 y (n = 56) who consumed a placebo, 20 ?g vitamin D3, or 7 or 20 ?g 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 daily throughout 10 wk of winter. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by using an enzyme-linked immunoassay, and serum albumin–corrected calcium (S-Ca) was assessed colorimetrically at the baseline, midpoint, and endpoint of the study.

Results: The mean (±SD) increases (per microgram of vitamin D compound) in serum 25(OH)D concentrations over baseline after 10 wk of supplementation were 0.96 ± 0.62, 4.02 ± 1.27, and 4.77 ± 1.04 nmol ? L?1 ? ?g intake?1 for the 20-?g vitamin D3/d and 7- and 20-?g 25-hydroxyvitamin D3/d groups, respectively. A comparison of the 7- and 20-?g 25-hydroxyvitamin D3/d groups with the 20-?g vitamin D3/d group yielded conversion factors of 4.2 and 5, respectively. There was no effect of treatment on S-Ca concentrations and no incidence of hypercalcemia (S-Ca >2.6 nmol/L).

Conclusions: Each microgram of orally consumed 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was about  **5 times more effective**  in raising serum 25(OH)D in older adults in winter than an equivalent amount of vitamin D3. This conversion factor could be used in food-compositional tables for relevant foods. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01398202.
