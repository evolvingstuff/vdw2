Miss Ohio Teen USA on responsible tanning and moderate UV

Backed By Altima Tan, Miss Ohio Teen USA 2010 To Raise Awareness About Responsible Tanning, Moderate Exposure To UV Rays

AKRON, Ohio, April 26 /PRNewswire/ -- Bridget Linton is used to the spotlight.

Her passion for Irish dancing has landed her on stages throughout the U.S., Ireland and Scotland. A high school cheerleader and homecoming queen, today she's a freshman member of the dance team at the University of Akron while pursuing a major in broadcast journalism.

She's also Miss Ohio Teen USA 2010.

Crowned last October, Linton tours her state as a goodwill ambassador, making appearances at schools, guest speaking and working with charities including D.A.R.E., the Susan G. Komen Foundation and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

One of her platforms during her year-long reign is responsible tanning and the health benefits gained from moderate exposure to UV rays.

"Moderate exposure to ultraviolet rays is the key to tanning responsibly," she said. "The danger of a body's exposure to UV rays comes when the skin gets burned and what can result from sunburn. Moderate exposure for people who can develop a tan is the smartest way to maximize the benefits of exposure and minimize risks."

Linton will advise people of all ages during her reign to learn their skin type, find out how much exposure their skin can accept without burning, protect their skin with protective lotions and wear safe, protective eyewear. "Those who find themselves in the sun regularly and people who utilize the services of a tanning salon should also check with their physicians about any photosensitivity issues they might have regarding prescription medication they're taking and exposure," she said.

She'll also help educate Ohioans about the benefits of UV exposure past simply getting a bronze glow on the outside.

"In the U.S., people are suffering from a serious vitamin D deficiency," said Tim Freeman who owns Altima Tan and Massage in Akron. Freeman approached Linton shortly after she was crowned to help back her responsible tanning platform. "Research has proven that UV rays trigger the synthesis of vitamin D and are responsible for the health benefits of exposure. While one doesn't have to develop a tan to produce vitamin D and everyone should avoid overexposure to prevent skin burn, which causes skin cancer, in reality tanning is a great way to stimulate the body's production of vitamin D."

Freeman's salon, in business since 2007, tans on average 260 people a day. He is an ardent supporter of tanning in moderation and tanning responsibly. He and each of his five employees strictly follow critically important tanning guidelines developed by tanning industry leader ETS Tan (http://www.etstan.com), the International Tanning Association, Suntan Supply and the FDA.

"Salon services are in higher demand by a wide range of individuals than ever before," he said. "As a business owner, I want to provide the best products and services at the best prices. But above all, I want to be a responsible, reputable business. Our top priority is to ensure that every customer who chooses to come in follows established tanning guidelines and most importantly follows recommended frequency and durations of sessions according to their skin type.‚Äù
