Perhaps the lowest in the world

Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be related to various cardiovascular diseases, including sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). This study investigated the association of vitamin D deficiency with neurologic outcome after SCA.

Methods: We prospectively analyzed clinical data from all unconscious patients resuscitated from a SCA of presumed cardiac cause. Neurologic outcome was assessed by Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 6 months after discharge. Good neurologic outcome was defined as CPC score of 1 or 2, whereas poor one as CPC scores of 3 through 5. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D <10 ng/mL.

Results: A total of 65 patients <span>[51 men (79%), mean age 59 ± 14 years]</span> were included from May 2012 to October 2013 in this study. First monitored rhythm was shockable rhythm, including ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, in 44 (68%) and non-shockable rhythm, including pulseless electrical activity or asystole, in 21 (32%). Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed in 51 (79%) and mean arrest time and CPR time were 26 ± 20 min and 22 ± 18 min, respectively. The  **mean vitamin D level was 10.5**  ± 5.3 ng/mL and vitamin D deficiency was observed in 39 (60%) patients. 

Vitamin D level was significantly lower among patients with poor neurologic outcome than in those with good outcome (8.0 ± 3.8 vs. 12.1 ± 5.6 ng/mL, p=0.001). 

Patients with vitamin D deficiency were likely to have more poor neurologic outcome (59 vs. 18%, p=0.001) and mortality (28 vs. 0%, p=0.002). 

In multivariate logistic analysis, vitamin D deficiency ( **OR 6.72** , 95% CI 2.03-22.26, p=0.002) was the significant independent predictor of poor neurologic outcome after SCA with absence of bystander CPR, first monitored non-shockable rhythm, and baseline renal dysfunction.

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is the important independent predictor of poor neurologic outcome following SCA.
