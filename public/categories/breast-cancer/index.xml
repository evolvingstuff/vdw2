&lt;p>The microbiota plays critical roles in regulating the function and health of the intestine and extraintestinal organs. A fundamental question is whether an intestinal-microbiome-breast axis exists during the development of breast cancer. If so, what are the roles of host factors? Vitamin D receptor (VDR) involves host factors and the human microbiome. Vdr gene variation shapes the human microbiome, and VDR deficiency leads to dysbiosis. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects hosts against tumorigenesis in the breast. We examined a 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer model in intestinal epithelial VDR knockout (VDRAIEC) &lt;strong>mice&lt;/strong> with dysbiosis. We reported that VDRAIEC &lt;strong>mice&lt;/strong> with dysbiosis are more susceptible to breast cancer induced by DMBA. Intestinal and breast microbiota analysis showed that VDR deficiency leads to a bacterial profile shift from normal to susceptible to carcinogenesis. We found enhanced bacterial staining within breast tumors. At the molecular and cellular levels, we identified the mechanisms by which intestinal epithelial VDR deficiency led to increased gut permeability, disrupted tight junctions, microbial translocation, and enhanced inflammation, thus increasing tumor size and number in the breast. Furthermore, treatment with the beneficial bacterial metabolite butyrate or the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum reduced breast tumors, enhanced tight junctions, inhibited inflammation, increased butyryl-CoA transferase, and decreased levels of breast Streptococcus bacteria in VDRAIEC &lt;strong>mice&lt;/strong> . The gut microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases not only in the intestine but also in the breast. Our study provides insights into the mechanism by which intestinal VDR dysfunction and gut dysbiosis lead to a high risk of extraintestinal tumorigenesis. Gut-tumor-microbiome interactions represent a new target in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer increased 2.3 X with high Phosphate in diet if not increase vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-increased-23-x-with-high-phosphate-in-diet-if-not-increase-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-increased-23-x-with-high-phosphate-in-diet-if-not-increase-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Dietary vitamin D3 has attracted wide interest as a natural compound for breast cancer prevention and therapy, supported by in vitro and animal studies. The exact mechanism of such action of vitamin D3 is unknown and may include several independent or partly dependent pathways. The active metabolite of vitamin D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D, calcitriol), binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and induces its translocation to the nucleus, where it transactivates a myriad of genes. Vitamin D3 is involved in the maintenance of a normal epigenetic profile whose disturbance may contribute to breast cancer. In general, the protective effect of vitamin D3 against breast cancer is underlined by inhibition of proliferation and migration, stimulation of differentiation and apoptosis, and inhibition of epithelial/mesenchymal transition in breast cells. Vitamin D3 may also inhibit the transformation of normal mammary progenitors into breast cancer stem cells that initiate and sustain the growth of breast tumors. As long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in breast cancer pathogenesis, and the specific mechanisms underlying this role are poorly understood, we provided several arguments that vitamin D3/VDR may induce protective effects in breast cancer through modulation of lncRNAs that are important for breast cancer pathogenesis. The main lncRNAs candidates to mediate the protective effect of vitamin D3 in breast cancer are lncBCAS1-4_1, AFAP1 antisense RNA 1 (AFAP1-AS1), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 511 (LINC00511), LINC00346, small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6), and SNHG16, but there is a rationale to explore several other lncRNAs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer risk factor is a virus in dairy products</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-risk-factor-is-a-virus-in-dairy-products.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-risk-factor-is-a-virus-in-dairy-products.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mammary gland and breast cancer has long been recognized, and multiple pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that its ligand 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) modulates normal mammary gland development and inhibits growth of breast tumors in animal models. Vitamin D deficiency is common in breast cancer patients and some evidence suggests that low vitamin D status enhances the risk for disease development or progression. Although many 1,25D responsive targets in normal mammary cells and in breast cancers have been identified, validation of specific targets that regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy and differentiation, particularly in vivo, has been challenging. Model systems of carcinogenesis have provided evidence that both VDR expression and 1,25D actions change with transformation, but clinical data regarding vitamin D responsiveness of established tumors is limited and inconclusive. Because breast cancer is heterogeneous, the relevant VDR targets and potential sensitivity to vitamin D repletion or supplementation will likely differ between patient populations. Detailed analysis of VDR actions in specific molecular subtypes of the disease will be necessary to clarify the conflicting data. Genomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses of in vitro and in vivo model systems is also warranted to comprehensively understand the network of vitamin D regulated pathways in the context of breast cancer heterogeneity. This review provides an update on recent studies spanning the spectrum of mechanistic (cell/molecular), pre-clinical (animal models) and translational work on the role of vitamin D in breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer Trial using monotherapy vitamin D will probably fail</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-trial-using-monotherapy-vitamin-d-will-probably-fail.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-trial-using-monotherapy-vitamin-d-will-probably-fail.html</guid><description>&lt;h5 id="assessment-the-effect-of-vitamin-d-supplementation-on-plasma-vitamin-d-levels-inflammation-and-oxidative-stress-biomarkers-based-on-vitamin-d-receptor-genetic-variation-in-breast-cancer-survivors-a-protocol-for-clinical-trial">Assessment the effect of vitamin D supplementation on plasma vitamin D levels, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers based on vitamin D receptor genetic variation in breast cancer survivors: a protocol for clinical trial&lt;/h5>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that exerts its actions through ligation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a transcription factor of the nuclear receptor family. VDR has not only physiologic actions in calcium metabolism but also several other cellular effects through extensive binding to the DNA and modification of genome expression. In cancer, it has neoplasia-suppressive effects and various mechanisms of action mediating cancer cell inhibition have been described. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to increased risk of breast cancer. A role of the vitamin once the disease has been diagnosed is also probable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer chemo made more women vitamin D insufficient, even 6 months later– 2019</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-chemo-made-more-women-vitamin-d-insufficient-even-6-months-later-2019.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-chemo-made-more-women-vitamin-d-insufficient-even-6-months-later-2019.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Breast Cancer risk reduced 17 percent by 1 hour of daily summer sun – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-risk-reduced-17-percent-by-1-hour-of-daily-summer-sun-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-risk-reduced-17-percent-by-1-hour-of-daily-summer-sun-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>Background: This study investigated the association of vitamin D3 levels with breast cancer risk and progression in African-Americans and Hispanics. Methods: A total of 237 African-American (Cases = 119, Control = 118) and 423 Hispanic women (Cases = 124, Control = 299) were recruited in the study. Blood samples were collected at the time of breast cancer screening and prior to cancer treatment for 4 weeks on average for the cases. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D3) was measured at a Quest-Diagnostics facility.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer rate reduced by 40 percent with Omega-3 – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-rate-reduced-by-40-percent-with-omega-3-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-rate-reduced-by-40-percent-with-omega-3-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="chart-of-zheng-data-by-grassroots-health">Chart of Zheng data by Grassroots Health&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Studies have shown that vitamin D could have a role in breast cancer survival; however, the evidence of the relationship between patients’ vitamin D levels and their survival has been inconsistent. This meta-analysis explores possible dose-response relationships between vitamin D levels and overall survival by allowing for differences in vitamin D levels among populations of the various studies. Studies relating vitamin D (25-OH-D &lt;span>[25-hydroxyvitamin D]&lt;/span>) levels in breast cancer patients with their survival were identified by searching PubMed and Embase. A pooled HR (hazard ratio) comparing the highest with the lowest category of circulating 25-OH-D levels were synthesized using the Mantel-Haenszel method under a fixed-effects model. A two-stage fixed-effects dose-response model including both linear (a log-linear dose-response regression) and nonlinear (a restricted cubic spline regression) models were used to further explore possible dose-response relationships.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer severity strongly associated with low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-severity-strongly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-severity-strongly-associated-with-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>So Tell Me . . .

&lt;p>Vitamin D is involved in a wide variety of biological processes including bone metabolism, modulation of the immune response, and regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The present study aimed to investigate vitamin D status and the genetic polymorphism BsmI (A/G) of vitamin D receptor (VDR) among a group of Egyptian female patients with breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer outcomes much better if higher vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-outcomes-much-better-if-higher-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-outcomes-much-better-if-higher-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hypothesis: Vitamin D treating of breast and other cancers may be via CCN genes</title><link>/posts/hypothesis-vitamin-d-treating-of-breast-and-other-cancers-may-be-via-ccn-genes.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hypothesis-vitamin-d-treating-of-breast-and-other-cancers-may-be-via-ccn-genes.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="regulation-of-the-ccn-genes-by-vitamin-d-a-possible-adjuvant-therapy-in-the-treatment-of-cancer-and-fibrosis">Regulation of the CCN genes by vitamin D: A possible adjuvant therapy in the treatment of cancer and fibrosis&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The CCN family is composed of six cysteine-rich, modular, and conserved proteins whose functions span a variety of tissues and include cell proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Roles for the CCN proteins throughout the entire body including the skin, kidney, brain, blood vessels, hematopoietic compartment and others, are continuously being elucidated. Likewise, an understanding of the regulation of this important gene family is constantly becoming clearer, through identification of transcription factors that directly activate, repress, or respond to upstream cell signaling pathways, as well as other forms of gene expression control. Vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or calcitriol), a vitamin essential for numerous biological processes, acts as a potent gene expression modulator. The regulation of the CCN gene family members by calcitriol has been described in many contexts. Here, we provide a concise and thorough overview of what is known about calcitriol and its regulation of the CCN genes, and argue that its regulation is of physiological importance in a wide breadth of tissues in which CCN genes function. In addition, we highlight the effects of vitamin D on CCN gene expression in the setting of two common pathologic conditions, fibrosis and cancer, and propose that the therapeutic effects of vitamin D3 described in these disease states may in part be attributable to CCN gene modulation. As vitamin D is perfectly safe in a wide range of doses and already showing promise as an adjuvant therapeutic agent, a deeper understanding of its control of CCN gene expression may have profound implications in clinical management of disease.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Mammography Specialists – Breast Cancer prevented and treated with Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/digital-mammography-specialists-breast-cancer-prevented-and-treated-with-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/digital-mammography-specialists-breast-cancer-prevented-and-treated-with-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-deficiency--breast-cancer-relationship-high-vitamin-d-levels-increase-survival-rate-after-mammogram-breast-cancer-detection--diagnosishttpsdmsradcomvitamin-d-deficiency-breast-cancer-relationship-high-vitamin-d-levels-increase-survival-rate-after-mammogram-breast-cancer-detection-diagnosis">&lt;a href="https://dmsrad.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-breast-cancer-relationship-high-vitamin-d-levels-increase-survival-rate-after-mammogram-breast-cancer-detection-diagnosis/">Vitamin D Deficiency &amp;amp; Breast Cancer Relationship; High Vitamin D Levels Increase Survival Rate After Mammogram Breast Cancer Detection &amp;amp; Diagnosis&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>The aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated musculoskeletal (MSK) pain symptoms are often debilitating and limit compliance with this important hormonal breast cancer therapy. The etiology of this syndrome is unknown. Hypovitaminosis D has been suggested as a possible risk factor for the development of MSK symptoms in women starting AIs. The objective of this substudy was to define the prevalence of low 25(OH)D in this population, to assess risk of low levels on developing pain and to define a target therapeutic goal for 25(OH)D in this population. This analysis was part of a 6-month prospective cohort study examining the MSK side effects of adjuvant AI therapy in postmenopausal women. Patients were evaluated by a rheumatologist with a joint examination, had 25(OH)D levels measured and completed quality of life questionnaires at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Symptomatic patients were defined as those that self-reported new or worsening MSK symptoms. Of 52 patients, 28 (54%) were symptomatic, and two (3.8%) stopped AIs due to MSK ailments. Thirteen patients had objective evidence of tendonitis on rheumatologic examination. Thirty-three percent of all subjects had baseline 25(OH)D levels &amp;lt;40 ng/mL, 19.2% had levels &amp;lt;30 ng/mL and 5.8% had levels &amp;lt;20 ng/mL. Symptomatic patients were more likely to have had baseline levels below 40 ng/mL, compared with asymptomatic patients ( &lt;strong>46.4% versus 16.7%&lt;/strong> , p = 0.037). In multivariate regression analyses, levels &amp;lt;40 ng/mL were associated with developing objective tenosynovitis (p = 0.033) but not with developing nonspecific myalgias. Our findings suggest hypovitaminosis D may be contributing to the AI-associated MSK pain syndrome and in particular to the development of tendonitis. Repletion to 25(OH)D levels &amp;gt;40 ng/mL is advisable. Further research should be carried out on identifying additional modifiable risk factors for this syndrome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D associated with 2X better health and less stress, both before and after Breast Cancer</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-associated-with-2x-better-health-and-less-stress-both-before-and-after-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-associated-with-2x-better-health-and-less-stress-both-before-and-after-breast-cancer.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Breast Cancer risk reduced (in mice) which got vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-risk-reduced-in-mice-which-got-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-risk-reduced-in-mice-which-got-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="inhibition-of-mouse-breast-tumor-initiating-cells-by-calcitriol-and-dietary-vitamin-d">Inhibition of Mouse Breast Tumor Initiating Cells by Calcitriol and Dietary Vitamin D.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background: Experimental studies suggest potential anti-carcinogenic properties of vitamin D against breast cancer risk, but the epidemiological evidence to date is inconsistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases along with a hand search for eligible studies to examine the association between vitamin D status (based on diet and blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)) and breast cancer risk or mortality in a meta-analysis. A random-effect model was used to calculate a pooled adjusted relative risk (RR).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer probability reduced 12 percent with daily hour of (outdoor) exercise</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-probability-reduced-12-percent-with-daily-hour-of-outdoor-exercise.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-probability-reduced-12-percent-with-daily-hour-of-outdoor-exercise.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="regular-physical-activity-reduces-breast-cancer-risk-irrespective-of-age">Regular physical activity reduces breast cancer risk irrespective of age&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a potentially modifiable risk factor that may be targeted for breast cancer (BC) prevention. It may also be related to prognosis after diagnosis and treatment. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as measured by serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) levels in patients with BC and to evaluate its correlations with life-style and treatments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on encouraging Vitamin D to reduce Breast Cancer, etc.</title><link>/posts/thoughts-on-encouraging-vitamin-d-to-reduce-breast-cancer-etc.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/thoughts-on-encouraging-vitamin-d-to-reduce-breast-cancer-etc.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Got started on this when I realized that more data is not needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In recent years, the scientific evidence linking vitamin D status or supplementation to breast cancer has grown notably. To investigate the role of vitamin D supplementation on breast cancer incidence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing vitamin D with placebo or no treatment. We used OVID to search MEDLINE (R), EMBASE and CENTRAL until April 2012. We screened the reference lists of included studies and used the &amp;ldquo;Related Article&amp;rdquo; feature in PubMed to identify additional articles. No language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently extracted data on methodological quality, participants, intervention, comparison and outcomes. Risk Ratios and 95% Confident Intervals for breast cancer were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) test. In sensitivity analysis, we assessed the impact of vitamin D dosage and mode of administration on treatment effects. Only two randomized controlled trials fulfilled the pre-set inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis included 5372 postmenopausal women.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer associated with low vitamin D in low latitudes only in white women</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-in-low-latitudes-only-in-white-women.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-in-low-latitudes-only-in-white-women.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="plasma-25-hydroxyvitamin-d3-is-associated-with-decreased-risk-of-postmenopausal-breast-cancer-in-whites-a-nested-case-control-study-in-the-multiethnic-cohort-study">Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 is associated with decreased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in whites: a nested case-control study in the multiethnic cohort study.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Higher sunlight exposure is correlated with lower incidence of breast cancer in ecological studies, but findings from prospective studies regarding the association of circulating levels of vitamin D with the risk of breast cancer have been null. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between plasma levels of vitamin D and the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D proven to treat or prevent many cancers in animals, but only breast cancer in humans so far</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-proven-to-treat-or-prevent-many-cancers-in-animals-but-only-breast-cancer-in-humans-so-far.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-proven-to-treat-or-prevent-many-cancers-in-animals-but-only-breast-cancer-in-humans-so-far.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>The negative association of the latitude where people live and the incidence of non cutaneous cancer in that population in North America have been demonstrated in many studies for many types of cancer. Since the intensity of UVB exposure decreases with increasing latitude, and UVB exposure provides the mechanism for vitamin D production in the skin, the hypothesis that increased vitamin D provides protection against the development of cancer has been proposed. This hypothesis has been tested in a substantial number of prospective and case control studies and in a few randomized clinical trials (RTC) assessing whether either vitamin D intake or serum levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) correlate (inversely) with cancer development. Most of the studies have focused on colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. The results have been mixed. The most compelling data for a beneficial relationship between vitamin D intake or serum 25OHD levels and cancer have been obtained for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>30 percent reduced chance of breast cancer death if take tiny amount of vitamin D (one-a-day)</title><link>/posts/30-percent-reduced-chance-of-breast-cancer-death-if-take-tiny-amount-of-vitamin-d-one-a-day.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/30-percent-reduced-chance-of-breast-cancer-death-if-take-tiny-amount-of-vitamin-d-one-a-day.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="multivitamin-and-mineral-use-and-breast-cancer-mortality-in-older-women-with-invasive-breast-cancer-in-the-womens-health-initiative">Multivitamin and mineral use and breast cancer mortality in older women with invasive breast cancer in the women&amp;rsquo;s health initiative.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Previous evidence suggests that higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) levels are variably associated with lower breast cancer risk; however, prospective studies and clinical trials have been inconsistent, particularly between older and younger women of differing menopausal status. We conducted a quantitative nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies evaluating the association between circulating 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk, stratified by menopause. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE included studies published through May 2011.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer 2X more likely if have taken statins for 10 years</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-2x-more-likely-if-have-taken-statins-for-10-years.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-2x-more-likely-if-have-taken-statins-for-10-years.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="long-term-statin-use-and-risk-of-ductal-and-lobular-breast-cancer-among-women-55-74-years-of-age">Long-term statin use and risk of ductal and lobular breast cancer among women 55-74 years of age.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>There were some case-control studies, nested case-control studies, and cohort studies with controversial results on the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> and breast cancer risk. Case-control studies are prone to selection bias, which limit the strength and quality of the evidence. To overcome the shortcoming of the case-control studies, the meta-analysis of prospective studies including nested case-control studies and cohort studies was conducted. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched, and the last retrieval date was March 24, 2013. For the highest versus the lowest level of serum 25(OH)D, the relative risks (RRs) and its 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from each study were used to estimate summary RR and its 95 % CI. Subgroup analyses by geographic region, menopausal status, and adjusted status of RR were also performed, respectively. A dose-response association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk was assessed. Fourteen articles with 9,110 breast cancer cases and 16,244 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely significantly associated with breast cancer risk (RR = 0.845, 95 % CI = 0.750-0.951). Inversely statistically significant associations were observed in North American studies, postmenopausal women, and studies with adjusted and unadjusted RR, respectively. No statistically significant associations were observed in European studies and premenopausal women, respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer survival 2X more likely if vitamin D sufficient – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-survival-2x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-sufficient-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-survival-2x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-sufficient-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-relationship-between-serum-vitamin-d-levels-and-breast-cancer-prognosis-a-meta-analysis">The relationship between serum vitamin D levels and breast cancer prognosis: A meta-analysis.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2900 IU not enough vitamin D to deal with Breast Cancer</title><link>/posts/2900-iu-not-enough-vitamin-d-to-deal-with-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2900-iu-not-enough-vitamin-d-to-deal-with-breast-cancer.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wide variety of data on vitamin D and breast cancer, but still insufficient clinical data</title><link>/posts/wide-variety-of-data-on-vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-but-still-insufficient-clinical-data.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wide-variety-of-data-on-vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-but-still-insufficient-clinical-data.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-are-we-ready-to-supplement-for-breast-cancer-prevention-and-treatment">Vitamin d: are we ready to supplement for breast cancer prevention and treatment?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Abstract&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oestrogen and family history are two of the most important risk factors for breast cancer. However, these risk factors cannot explain the differences in the incidence and recurrence of breast cancer between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In this paper I propose that, in premenopausal women, an iron deficiency caused by menstruation stabilises hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha, which increases the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor. This mechanism results in premenopausal women being more susceptible to angiogenesis and, consequently, leads to a high recurrence of breast cancer. Conversely, increased concentrations of iron in postmenopausal women, as a result of menstrual cessation, contribute to a high incidence of breast cancer via oxidative-stress pathways. Although the focus of this Personal View is on iron, this by no means negates the roles of other known risk factors in breast-cancer development. Characterisation of the role of iron in breast cancer could potentially benefit patients by decreasing recurrence and incidence and increasing overall survival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If have breast cancer, should increase vitamin D to more than 30 ng</title><link>/posts/if-have-breast-cancer-should-increase-vitamin-d-to-more-than-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/if-have-breast-cancer-should-increase-vitamin-d-to-more-than-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer">Vitamin D and Breast Cancer&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer chance decreased 16 percent for every extra ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-chance-decreased-16-percent-for-every-extra-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-chance-decreased-16-percent-for-every-extra-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="higher-blood-25ohd-level-may-reduce-the-breast-cancer-risk">Higher Blood 25(OH)D Level May Reduce the Breast Cancer Risk:&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Calcitriol is the active form of Vitamin D3. Epidemiological data show that women with Vitamin D deficiency at the time of breast cancer diagnosis are 94% more likely to experience cancer spread and 73% more likely to die over the next 10 years, compared to women with adequate Vitamin D levels. Since vitamin D deficiency is especially common in African American and obese women, this observation may partially explain the relatively poor clinical outcome experienced by these patients &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>. Although current treatments for IBC are very aggressive and include surgery and radiation, IBC is still the most deadly breast cancer and has a survival rate of only 40% past 5 years. Novel treatments are desperately needed &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>. Current limitations for the use of calcitriol as a treatment for IBC and non-IBC breast cancer is that high concentrations of calcitriol must be delivered to the tumor. This is even more complicated for IBC, since the tumor rapidly metastasizes and disseminates trough the lymphatic system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3X increased chance of Breast Cancer if recent vitamin D levels were low</title><link>/posts/3x-increased-chance-of-breast-cancer-if-recent-vitamin-d-levels-were-low.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/3x-increased-chance-of-breast-cancer-if-recent-vitamin-d-levels-were-low.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-in-the-military-a-case-control-study-utilizing-pre-diagnostic-serum">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and breast cancer in the military: a case-control study utilizing pre-diagnostic serum.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Links between a low vitamin D status and an increased risk of breast cancer have been observed in epidemiological studies. These links have been investigated in human tissue homogenates and cultured cell lines. We have used non-malignant, malignant and normal reduction mammoplasty breast tissues to investigate the biological and metabolic consequences of the application of vitamin D to intact ex vivo human breast tissue. Tissues were exposed to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1,25D; active metabolite) and 25(OH)D (25D; pre-metabolite). Changes in mRNA expression and protein expression after vitamin D exposure were analysed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Off Topic GMO Roundup Corn causes lots of cancer and other problems in rats</title><link>/posts/off-topic-gmo-roundup-corn-causes-lots-of-cancer-and-other-problems-in-rats.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/off-topic-gmo-roundup-corn-causes-lots-of-cancer-and-other-problems-in-rats.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>The sun appears better at reducing incidence of some cancers than vitamin D</title><link>/posts/the-sun-appears-better-at-reducing-incidence-of-some-cancers-than-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-sun-appears-better-at-reducing-incidence-of-some-cancers-than-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="is-prevention-of-cancer-by-sun-exposure-more-than-just-the-effect-of-vitamin-d--a-systematic-review-of-epidemiological-studies">Is prevention of cancer by sun exposure more than just the effect of vitamin D? -A systematic review of epidemiological studies.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Based on preclinical studies and early clinical observations, an association between vitamin D status and breast cancer incidence and outcome has been proposed. Against this background, information on vitamin D and breast cancer was reviewed with focused attention on emerging clinical studies in this area. Prospective cohort studies do not associate 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with breast cancer incidence. While case-control studies of this question are positive, they may be confounded by reverse causality as 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels are influenced by breast cancer presence and stage. Studies of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and subsequent breast cancer recurrence provide mixed results but strongest associations were seen in analyses uncontrolled for prognostic variables, cancer therapy, BMI and physical activity. The one full-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating calcium (1000 mg elemental calcium per day) and vitamin D supplementation (400 IU D3 per day) with 36,282 participants failed to demonstrate a supplement effect on lowering breast cancer incidence. Breast cancer patients not uncommonly have vitamin D deficiency but limited control populations in available reports preclude precise prevalence estimates. As breast cancer patients are at risk for bone loss and musculoskeletal complaints from cancer or associated therapies, monitoring 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vitamin D3 supplementation in moderate dose (1,000- 1,500 IU D3 per day) can be recommended with expectation of mainly bone benefit. In women with breast cancer, future vitamin D supplementation studies need to be appropriately designed and powered to provide definitive assessments. However, a full-scale randomized trial evaluating the influence of vitamin D supplementation on breast cancer recurrence is likely not feasible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancer - Breast</title><link>/posts/cancer-breast.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-breast.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">&lt;/nav></description></item><item><title>Big Pharma continues to seek a patentable form of vitamin D for Breast Cancer</title><link>/posts/big-pharma-continues-to-seek-a-patentable-form-of-vitamin-d-for-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/big-pharma-continues-to-seek-a-patentable-form-of-vitamin-d-for-breast-cancer.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Postmenopausal Breast cancer 63 percent more likely if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/postmenopausal-breast-cancer-63-percent-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/postmenopausal-breast-cancer-63-percent-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Breast Cancer incidence change by 40 percent with vitamin D receptor genes</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-incidence-change-by-40-percent-with-vitamin-d-receptor-genes.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-incidence-change-by-40-percent-with-vitamin-d-receptor-genes.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-receptor-gene-haplotypes-and-polymorphisms-and-risk-of-breast-cancer-a-nested-casecontrol-study">Vitamin D Receptor Gene Haplotypes and Polymorphisms and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Nested Case–Control Study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, associated with diverse biological behaviours and clinical outcome. Although some molecular subgroups of breast cancer have a targeted therapy, the most aggressive tumours still lack a molecular target. Despite Vitamin D being classically associated with the physiological role of calcium regulation and phosphate transport in bone metabolism, several studies have been demonstrating a wide range of functions for this hormone, which are particularly important in the field of cancer. The mechanisms underlying the protective actions of Vitamin D in cancer development are only sparsely understood, but evidence shows that Vitamin D participates in cell growth regulation, apoptosis and cell differentiation. In addition, Vitamin D has been implicated in the suppression of cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Most of Vitamin D biological actions are mediated by the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the synthesis and catabolism of this hormone are regulated by the enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1. In the present review we highlight research data concerning the function of this hormone in the mammary gland, with a special focus on breast carcinogenesis. Hence, and although the available data are controversial, we considered not only updated information on epidemiology of Vitamin D in breast cancer and its potential value as a therapeutic agent or prophylactic (with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms and effectors of Vitamin D action), but we included data on its role in other stages of breast cancer progression as well. Accordingly, we review data on the influence of Vitamin D in the development of normal breast and the expression of Vitamin D-related proteins (VDR, CYP27B1 and CYP24A21) in benign mammary lesions and ductal carcinomas in situ.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>85 percent less risk of death from Breast Cancer when vitamin D levels higher than 30 ng</title><link>/posts/85-percent-less-risk-of-death-from-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-levels-higher-than-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/85-percent-less-risk-of-death-from-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-levels-higher-than-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-status-at-breast-cancer-diagnosis-correlation-with-tumor-characteristics-disease-outcome-and-genetic-determinants-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency">Vitamin D status at breast cancer diagnosis: correlation with tumor characteristics, disease outcome and genetic determinants of vitamin D insufficiency&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D regulates the flow of calcium into the bloodstream and is crucial for normal bone development. Vitamin D also has a role in regulating parathyroid, neuromuscular, immune, and insulin functions. Vitamin D has been found to be associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and age-related cognitive impairment, as well as Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and esophageal, lung, pancreatic, renal, colorectal, endometrial, prostate and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>4X less Breast Cancer if have enough vitamin D</title><link>/posts/4x-less-breast-cancer-if-have-enough-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/4x-less-breast-cancer-if-have-enough-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-is-correlated-with-poor-outcomes-in-patients-with-luminal-type-breast-cancer">Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among United States (US) women. Established risk factors explain only about 13% of breast cancer incidence among women in the US. Thus, the cause of most cases of breast cancer remains unknown. In postmenopausal women, serum calcium (Ca) and serum magnesium (Mg) play an important role in skeletal health, cell proliferation and cancer. Mg is essential for DNA duplication and repair and Mg deficiency favors DNA mutations leading to carcinogenesis. Dietary intake of Mg in the US is less than the recommended amount, and the deficit is more pronounced in older individuals where gastrointestinal and renal mechanisms for Mg conservation are not as efficient. Furthermore, healthy postmenopausal women are frequently recommended to take supplemental Ca, but not Mg and vitamin D to maintain bone and overall health. Most women with hormone sensitive breast cancer are recommended to take aromatase inhibitors, which causes bone loss and thus are generally prescribed Ca and vitamin D, but not Mg. Although the association between serum Ca and breast cancer risk remains controversial, we hypothesize that this may be because Mg levels have not been accounted for. Mg level directly influences transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) related Ca influx, calcium-adenosine triphosphatase (Ca-ATP) levels, and cell proliferation, and thereby could lead to cancer. Thus a high serum Ca/Mg ratio is more appropriate and alterations in this ratio could lead to increased development of new and recurrent breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No association found between Calcium intake and risk of breast cancer</title><link>/posts/no-association-found-between-calcium-intake-and-risk-of-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-association-found-between-calcium-intake-and-risk-of-breast-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-and-calcium-intakes-and-breast-cancer-risk-in-pre--and-postmenopausal-women">Vitamin D and calcium intakes and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Preclinical investigations and selected clinical observational studies support an association between higher vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with lower breast cancer risk. However, the recently updated report from the Institute of Medicine concluded that, for cancer and vitamin D, the evidence was &amp;lsquo;inconsistent and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements&amp;rsquo;. Against this background, reports examining vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and breast cancer incidence and outcome were reviewed. Current evidence supports the pursuit of several research questions but not routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D monitoring and vitamin D supplementation to reduce breast cancer incidence or improve breast cancer outcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer Chemotherapy initially decreases vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-chemotherapy-initially-decreases-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-chemotherapy-initially-decreases-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>two articles on this page, both published May 2012&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To investigate the effect of aromatase inhibitors (AI) on intestinal calcium absorption, measured using the gold-standard dual stable calcium isotope method. In this pilot study, we recruited 10 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who planned to initiate AI therapy; women receiving chemotherapy were excluded. Women completed two 24 h inpatient calcium absorption study visits, the first prior to AI therapy and the second at least 6 weeks following onset of AI therapy. We calculated total fractional calcium absorption (TFCA) using the dose-corrected fractional recovery of two stable isotopes from 24 h urine collections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aromatase inhibitor chemotherapy after breast cancer not associated with vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/aromatase-inhibitor-chemotherapy-after-breast-cancer-not-associated-with-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/aromatase-inhibitor-chemotherapy-after-breast-cancer-not-associated-with-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-baseline-serum-vitamin-d-levels-on-aromatase-inhibitors-induced-musculoskeletal-symptoms-results-from-the-ibis-ii-chemoprevention-study-using-anastrozole">Effect of baseline serum vitamin D levels on aromatase inhibitors induced musculoskeletal symptoms: results from the IBIS-II, chemoprevention study using anastrozole&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Based upon recent clinical research findings, Vitamin D is the only remaining vitamin that may have significant cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention properties. Recent large-scale prospective randomized clinical research trials have not only failed to identify a cancer prevention role (beyond a healthy balanced diet) for Vitamin E, Vitamin C, folate, and beta-carotene (a member of the Vitamin A family) supplements, but data from these trials have strongly suggested an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, at least in some sub-groups of patients, with supplements of several of these vitamins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer 5 year study will give free vitamin D tests for 1000 women</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-5-year-study-will-give-free-vitamin-d-tests-for-1000-women.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-5-year-study-will-give-free-vitamin-d-tests-for-1000-women.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Breast Cancer Prevention Month&amp;ndash;Action!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent studies suggest that vitamin D may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk, but most studies have evaluated only dietary vitamin D intake. The associations among ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, factors related to cutaneous vitamin D production, and breast cancer risk were evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Ontario, Canada, between 2003 and 2004 (n = 3,101 cases and n = 3,471 controls).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No reduction in Breast Cancer when vitamin D less than 40 ng</title><link>/posts/no-reduction-in-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-less-than-40-ng.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-reduction-in-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-less-than-40-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="plasma-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-risk-of-breast-cancer-in-the-nurses-health-study-ii">Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of breast cancer in the Nurses&amp;rsquo; Health Study II&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Experimental evidence indicates vitamin D may play an important role in breast cancer etiology but epidemiologic evidence to date is inconsistent. Vitamin D comes from dietary intake and sun exposure and plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are considered the best measure of vitamin D status.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dental and breast cancer might be linked by Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/dental-and-breast-cancer-might-be-linked-by-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dental-and-breast-cancer-might-be-linked-by-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="unfortunately-no-abstact-this-side-of-a-paywall">Unfortunately no abstact this side of a paywall&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> is the major circulating form of vitamin D and a standard indicator of vitamin D status. Emerging evidence in the literature suggests a high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D (as defined by serum 25(OH)D levels of &amp;lt;32 ng/ml) as well as an association between lower serum levels and higher mortality in cancer. We investigated the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation as a means for restoring suboptimal levels to optimal levels in cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer more deadly for blacks than whites</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-more-deadly-for-blacks-than-whites.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-more-deadly-for-blacks-than-whites.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Breast Cancer recurred more when less than 20 ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-recurred-more-when-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-recurred-more-when-less-than-20-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-helps-prevent-breast-cancer-recurrence-death---new-study">Vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer recurrence, death - new study&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease associated with different patient prognosis and responses to therapy. Vitamin D has been emerging as a potential treatment for cancer, as it has been demonstrated that it modulates proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis, among others. It acts mostly through the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the synthesis and degradation of this hormone are regulated by the enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1, respectively. We aimed to study the expression of these three proteins by immunohistochemistry in a series of breast lesions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Might too much vitamin D cause a form of breast cancer</title><link>/posts/might-too-much-vitamin-d-cause-a-form-of-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/might-too-much-vitamin-d-cause-a-form-of-breast-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-at-pregnancy-and-risk-of-breast-cancer-in-a-prospective-study">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at pregnancy and risk of breast cancer in a prospective study.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>We reviewed and summarised observational epidemiological studies regarding the association between serum vitamin D (measured as 25(OH)D levels) and the risk of breast cancer (BC). Relevant studies published until September 2009 were identified by systematically electronic searching Ovid Medline, EMBASE and ISI Web of Knowledge databases and by cross-referencing. The following data were extracted in a standardised manner from eligible studies: first author, publication year, country, study design, characteristics of the study population, duration of follow-up, BC incidence/BC mortality according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and the respective ratios, and covariates adjusted for in the analysis. All existing observational epidemiological studies that reported at least one serum 25(OH)D level in subjects in any time period before or after a diagnosis of breast cancer were included in our review. Individual and summary risk ratios (RRs) for an increase of serum 25(OH)D by 20ng/ml were calculated using meta-analysis methods. Only 25(OH)D was considered. Overall, 10 articles were included. Specific results for BC incidence were reported in nine articles and for BC mortality in one article. In meta-analyses, summary RRs (95% confidence interval (CI)) for an increase of 25(OH)D by 20ng/ml were 0.59 (0.48–0.73), 0.92 (0.82–1.04) and 0.73 (0.60–0.88) with P values of &amp;lt;0.001, 0.164 and 0.001 for case-control studies, nested case-control studies and both study designs combined, respectively. No indication for publication bias was found, but there was large heterogeneity between studies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Progesterone decreased by 10 percent for every 4 ng increase in Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/progesterone-decreased-by-10-percent-for-every-4-ng-increase-in-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/progesterone-decreased-by-10-percent-for-every-4-ng-increase-in-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-association-with-estradiol-and-progesterone-in-young-women">Vitamin D association with estradiol and progesterone in young women&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Recent evidence has suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention and survival. Studies have reported an inverse relation between vitamin D intake and the risk of breast cancer, improvements in survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer in women with higher levels of vitamin D, and vitamin D insufficiency in up to 75% of women with breast cancer. Preclinical data have indicated that vitamin D affects up to 200 genes that influence cellular proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, terminal differentiation of normal and cancer cells, and macrophage function. Vitamin D receptors have been found in up to 80% of breast cancers, and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms have been associated with differences in survival. Although ongoing studies have investigated a possible link between adequate levels of vitamin D and improved cancer prognosis, breast cancer survivors may derive additional, non-cancer-related benefits from adequate vitamin D levels, including improvements in bone mineral density, quality of life, and mood. Maintaining adequate vitamin D stores is recommended for breast cancer survivors throughout their lifetime.

&lt;p>Abstract Vitamin D and calcium intake have been suggested to have protective effects against breast cancer; however, the data have been inconclusive. The present meta-analysis examined the overall effects of vitamin D intake, circulating 25(OH)D and 1?,25(OH)2D levels, and calcium intake on breast cancer risk. Data from 11 studies on vitamin D intake, 7 studies on circulating 25(OH)D levels, 3 studies of circulating 1?,25(OH)2D levels, and 15 studies on calcium intake and breast cancer risk were included in this analysis. From the meta-analysis, there was a significant inverse relationship between vitamin D intake and breast cancer risk, with an overall relative risk (RR) of high versus low vitamin D intake for breast cancer of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.85–0.97). The highest quantile of circulating 25(OH)D was found to be associated with a 45% (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38–0.80) decrease in breast cancer when compared with the lowest quantile. No significant association for the circulating 1?,25(OH)2D level and breast cancer was found (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.68–1.44). For calcium, a 19% (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72–0.90) decrease in breast cancer risk was found for those with highest quantile of calcium intake compared to the lowest quantile. These results provide strong evidence that vitamin D and calcium have a chemopreventive effect against breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Women with breast cancer safely take 10,000 IU daily</title><link>/posts/women-with-breast-cancer-safely-take-10000-iu-daily.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/women-with-breast-cancer-safely-take-10000-iu-daily.html</guid><description>&lt;p> &lt;/p>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has potential roles in breast cancer etiology and progression. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with increased toxicity from bisphosphonate therapy. The optimal dose of vitamin D supplementation is unknown, but daily sunlight exposure can generate the equivalent of a 10,000-IU oral dose of vitamin D(3). This study therefore aimed to assess the effect of this dose of vitamin D(3) in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No correlation between breast cancer - density - vitamin D</title><link>/posts/no-correlation-between-breast-cancer-density-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-correlation-between-breast-cancer-density-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="mammographic-density-plasma-vitamin-d-levels-and-risk-of-breast-cancer-in-postmenopausal-women">Mammographic density, plasma vitamin D levels, and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>A new study recently presented at the annual American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Meeting in Washington, D.C. has reported that &lt;a href="http://foodforbreastcancer.com/articles/how-important-is-vitamin-d-before-and-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis%3f">vitamin D3&lt;/a>can enhance sensitivity to &lt;a href="http://foodforbreastcancer.com/articles/what-should-breast-cancer-patients-eat-during-radiation-treatment%3f">radiation treatment&lt;/a>in breast cancer cells, thereby increasing the proportion of breast cancer cells killed by radiation. Previous studies conducted by the authors demonstrated that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D3 (D3), or its analogs such as EB 1089, can confer enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation. (The vitamin D3 sold to consumers in supplement form is cholecalciferol, which is metabolized in the human body to calcitriol, otherwise known as 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D3.) The present study was designed to extend the previous findings to ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells (a p53 wild type ER positive cell line) using D3 combined with ionizing radiation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer reduced by 45 percent for women with the most vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-reduced-by-45-percent-for-women-with-the-most-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-reduced-by-45-percent-for-women-with-the-most-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="meta-analysis-of-vitamin-d-calcium-and-the-prevention-of-breast-cancer">Meta-analysis of vitamin D, calcium and the prevention of breast cancer.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>BACKGROUND: Studies finding an inverse correlation of ambient solar irradiance with cancer mortality were the first to suggest that sun exposure and probably, therefore, vitamin D might protect against some cancers. Such correlation has been shown in Asian populations in some studies.

&lt;p>Epidemiological studies have suggested a reduced risk of several cancers associated with high vitamin D status. We performed a systematic review with meta-analyses of observational studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and colorectal, breast and prostate cancer, and colonic adenoma. The literature to December 2009 was searched without language restriction. The meta-regression analysis was done in order to compute dose-response effects. Because in case-control studies, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is measured after the diagnosis of cancer, separate analyses for case-control and prospective studies were done. We identified 35 independent studies. The seven studies on colorectal adenomas were heterogeneous in terms of endpoint and control for major confounding factors, and we did not perform a meta-analysis of these data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer association with low vitamin D suggested by Meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-association-with-low-vitamin-d-suggested-by-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-association-with-low-vitamin-d-suggested-by-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="meta-analysis-serum-vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-risk">Meta-analysis: Serum vitamin D and breast cancer risk.&lt;/h1>
