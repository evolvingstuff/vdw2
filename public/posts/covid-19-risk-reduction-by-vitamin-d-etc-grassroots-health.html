This study included 133 patients whose vitamin D levels at hospital admission ranged from 3 ng/ml to 97 ng/ml. 81% of the patients had a moderate course of disease. Of those suffering a severe course of COVID-19, 35% were severely vitamin D deficient and 15% were mildly vitamin D deficient. Only one of the 18 patients (6%) who died from COVID-19 had a vitamin D level greater than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L). This study concluded that disease severity and death due to COVID-19 were both associated with vitamin D deficiency (levels below 20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L), with increased significance among those whose vitamin D level was severely deficient, below 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/L).

As part of our What is Vitamin D Good For? series, this post will attempt to summarize those roles to clearly show how the immune system relies on vitamin D to function properly. Because vitamin D acts as a protector and regulator of all cell types, tissues, and organs, it is required for the proper functioning of each system of the body to help keep us healthy. This is especially true for our immune system, since vitamin D has specific regulatory effects on immune cells and inflammation.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-relies-vitamin-d/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/coronavirus-video-thumbnail-300x154.png alt=image><h4 id=-protective-role-of-vitamin-d-against-coronavirus-scientific-review-and-dose-for-immunity-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogprotective-role-vitamin-d-coronavirus-scientific-review-dose-immunity><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/protective-role-vitamin-d-coronavirus-scientific-review-dose-immunity/><strong>Protective Role of Vitamin D against Coronavirus: Scientific Review and Dose for Immunity</strong></a></h4><p>This video by Dr. Renu Mahtani is clear, concise, and beautifully explains how vitamin D directly affects lung health, inflammation, and helps prevent viral attack.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/protective-role-vitamin-d-coronavirus-scientific-review-dose-immunity/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202103vit-d-immune-system-video-768x433png-altimagevitamin-d-immune-system--sars-cov-2-covid-19-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogvitamin-d-immune-system-sars-cov-2-covid-19><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/vitamin-d-immune-system-sars-cov-2-covid-19/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vit-d-immune-system-video-768x433.png alt=image>Vitamin D, Immune System & SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)</strong></a></h4><p>This video by JJ Medicine discusses and clearly illustrates roles of vitamin D in immune system regulation, specifically with regards to how vitamin D can help protect against respiratory tract infections like SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

The authors illustrate just a few of the roles of vitamin D within the immune system during its response to a viral infection. The immune system relies on having a supply of vitamin D for specific needs, including increasing anti-inflammatory compounds and decreasing pro-inflammatory compounds – which is how it is able to reduce the severity of certain inflammatory reactions and decrease chances of cytokine storm.</p><p><a

Omega-3 fatty acids may help prevent COVID-19 disease specifically by increasing the activity of immune cells needed to identify and destroy the virus, therefore decreasing the likelihood of viral binding and invasion; promoting T regulatory cell development and a controlled inflammatory process; and inhibiting inflammation, decreasing the production of inflammatory chemicals, and preventing a cytokine storm.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/omega-3-fatty-acids-covid-19/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202009nutrient-deficiency-immune-function-table-768x896png-altimagedirect-effects-of-nutrient-deficiencies-on-immune-function-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogdirect-effects-nutrient-deficiencies-immune-function><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/direct-effects-nutrient-deficiencies-immune-function/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nutrient-deficiency-immune-function-table-768x896.png alt=image>Direct Effects of Nutrient Deficiencies on Immune Function</strong></a></h4><p>In this analogy, stilts are the pillars that your house of health is built upon, and many are required to keep the house stable and healthy. Being deficient in one or more nutrients weakens your stilts. Individual nutrient deficiencies have specific impacts on each stilt or body function and may impact other fibers in the stilt. The more deficiencies, the weaker each stilt becomes, allowing greater susceptibility to infection and disease – and the house falling. Providing your body with all the nutrients it needs is important for keeping your house of health supported.

Specifically, they looked at Vitamins A, C, D, E and zinc due to their well-known roles in immune function. The results show what the inadequate intakes are for each nutrient, based on intake from food alone and from food plus dietary supplements. While supplements do help bridge the gap for some, many are still left with inadequate intake of several key nutrients.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/nutrient-deficiencies-major-health-concern/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202006compromised-immune-function-diagram-768x436png-altimagenutrients-have-an-integral-role-in-immune-function-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblognutrients-integral-role-immune-function><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/nutrients-integral-role-immune-function/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/compromised-immune-function-diagram-768x436.png alt=image>Nutrients Have an Integral Role in Immune Function</strong></a></h4><p>One of the primary reasons for the current issue with the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is that so many people do not have a healthy enough immune response to protect them when they get exposed to the virus. Your nutritional status plays a central role in how your body functions and responds to daily lifestyle and environmental factors. Vitamins and minerals play integral roles in all body functions and are integral to your health.

But sometimes, infection takes hold and your immune system has to fight off those pathogens. What you may not realize is that the nutrients in your diet directly influence the ability of your immune system to function.  This is a review of the first and second lines of defense used by the immune system, immune memory, and the role different nutrients play within specific immune functions.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infections/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202008phagocytosis-image-300x212jpg-altimagehow-your-immune-system-protects-you-from-infection--part-2-phagocytes-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogimmune-system-protects-infection-part-2-phagocytes><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infection-part-2-phagocytes/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/phagocytosis-image-300x212.jpg alt=image>How Your Immune System Protects You From Infection – Part 2: Phagocytes</strong></a></h4><p>There are chemical factors (complement, acute-phase proteins and cytokines) and several types of non-specific immune cell types that roam around in the blood and tissues of the body on the look-out for pathogens (bacteria and viruses that cause disease).  These non-specific immune cells, called “phagocytes,” are a key component of the first line of defense and the focus of this article. Phagocytes, through a process called phagocytosis, gobble up (engulf) and kill (digest) bad bugs (pathogens) when they recognize them.  The process requires a balance of specific nutrients in order to function, and may be hindered when those nutrients are deficient.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infection-part-2-phagocytes/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202008humoral-immunity-300x237jpg-altimagehow-your-immune-system-protects-you-from-infection-part-3--b-cells--antibodies-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogimmune-system-protects-infection-part-3-b-cells-antibodies><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infection-part-3-b-cells-antibodies/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/humoral-immunity-300x237.jpg alt=image>How Your Immune System Protects You From Infection: Part 3 – B cells & Antibodies</strong></a></h4><p>The development of immunity to a pathogen through natural infection is a complex process that typically takes place over a couple of weeks and involves the innate and adaptive immune systems. The body responds immediately with a non-specific innate response in which phagocytes work to slow the progress of the infection and may prevent it from causing symptoms. This non-specific innate response is followed by an adaptive response. Today’s post will focus on humoral immunity (or the part of the immune response involving memory of a previous pathogen) and the production of antibodies.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infection-part-3-b-cells-antibodies/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202009helper-t-cells-768x744jpg-altimagehow-your-immune-system-protects-you-from-infection-part-4--t-lymphocytes-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogimmune-system-protects-infection-part-4-t-lymphocytes><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infection-part-4-t-lymphocytes/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/helper-t-cells-768x744.jpg alt=image>How Your Immune System Protects You From Infection: Part 4 – T lymphocytes</strong></a></h4><p>The adaptive immune system starts to work after the innate immune system is activated. If an infection progresses despite the inflammation, fever, and phagocyte activity of the innate immune system, a more coordinated response is required in order to destroy the pathogen. T cells orchestrate cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems in an attempt to overcome the pathogen.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/immune-system-protects-infection-part-4-t-lymphocytes/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=-img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202003vit-c-d-zinc-table-225x300png-altimagea-healthy-immune-response-relies-on-your-nutrient-status-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetbloghealthy-immune-response-relies-nutrient-status><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/healthy-immune-response-relies-nutrient-status/><strong><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Vit-C-D-Zinc-Table-225x300.png alt=image>A Healthy Immune Response Relies on Your Nutrient Status</strong></a></h4><p>“There is a close relationship between nutritional status and immune function.

Those in the zinc group experienced improvements in lymphocyte proliferation and saw a significant increase in the number of T cells. A correlation was found between the change in zinc concentration, lymphocyte proliferation (p=0.02), and the number of T cells in the blood (p=0.06). Combined with the importance of T cells for resisting infection, this study suggests that improving zinc status in those who are deficient may help to reduce the risk of infections such as pneumonia.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/improving-zinc-levels-improve-immune-function/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h3 id=flu-colds--other-respiratory-infections>Flu, Colds & Other Respiratory Infections</h3><hr><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Martineau-Vit-D-Supplementation-acute-RTIs-300x230.png alt=image><h4 id=up-to-70-lower-risk-of-acute-respiratory-tract-infections-with-vitamin-d-supplementationhttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblog70-lower-risk-acute-respiratory-tract-infections-vitamin-d-supplementation><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/70-lower-risk-acute-respiratory-tract-infections-vitamin-d-supplementation/>Up to 70% Lower Risk of Acute Respiratory Tract Infections with Vitamin D Supplementation</a></h4><p>In a meta-analysis published in 2017, Martineau et al. set out to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of acute respiratory tract infection (RTIs). The review included 25 randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trials (RCTs), with a total of 11,321 individual participants.  They found that vitamin D supplementation resulted in a statistically significant reduction in risk of RTIs among all participants, with a 12% lower risk of acute RTIs for those supplementing with vitamin D versus those with no supplementation.  The greatest protective effect was seen among participants who received daily or weekly supplementation and whose starting vitamin D level was less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/L), with a 70% decreased risk of acute RTI with vitamin D supplementation compared to a 25% reduction for those whose starting levels were greater than 10 ng/ml.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/70-lower-risk-acute-respiratory-tract-infections-vitamin-d-supplementation/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202004dancer-ards-fig-2-291x300png-altimage-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-ards-directly-influenced-by-vitamin-d-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogacute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-ards-directly-influenced-vitamin-d><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dancer-ARDS-Fig-2-291x300.png alt=image><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-ards-directly-influenced-vitamin-d/> <strong>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Directly Influenced by Vitamin D</strong></a></h4><p>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS, aka wet lung) is a condition resulting from severe respiratory injury or illness, such as pneumonia, in which the air sacs of the lungs fill with fluid, preventing the uptake of oxygen. The condition leads to shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, can lead to sepsis and/or death. ARDS is currently a major complication and cause of death among those with serious COVID-19 infections.  When comparing vitamin D levels among those with and at risk of ARDS, it was found that 96% of those at risk of ARDS were deficient in vitamin D, and surgery patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a 37.5% risk of lung injury post-surgery compared to a 15% risk for those whose vitamin D level was above 8 ng/ml (20 nmol/L), a 60% lower risk for those with higher vitamin D levels.</p><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-ards-directly-influenced-vitamin-d/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202003hong-infant-rtis-vit-d-300x252png-altimage-fewer-respiratory-tract-infections-in-infants-with-daily-supplementation-of-vitamin-dhttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogfewer-respiratory-tract-infections-infants-daily-supplementation-vitamin-d><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hong-Infant-RTIs-Vit-D-300x252.png alt=image> <strong><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/fewer-respiratory-tract-infections-infants-daily-supplementation-vitamin-d/>Fewer Respiratory Tract Infections in Infants with Daily Supplementation of Vitamin D</a></strong></h4><ul><li><p>infants who received supplementation 5-7 days per week were 54% less likely to get an RTI than those who did not receive any supplementation with vitamin D; risk of RTIs went down as the frequency of vitamin D supplementation increased.</p></li><li><p>Risk of any RTI, lower RTI, or RTI related hospitalization was reduced for infants receiving vitamin D supplementation, regardless of whether they were breastfed or formula fed.</p></li><li><p>Among infants who were diagnosed with an RTI, those who received any vitamin D supplementation developed their first RTI later than those who did not receive any vitamin D supplementation.</p></li><li><p>Infants receiving vitamin D supplementation at least 5 days per week had the best outcomes.</p></li></ul><p><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/fewer-respiratory-tract-infections-infants-daily-supplementation-vitamin-d/><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/read-more-button-2.png alt=image></a></p><hr><h4 id=img-srchttpswwwgrassrootshealthnetwp-contentuploads202004grant-1918-1919-flu-by-latitude-300x237png-altimage-could-more-solar-uvb-exposure-decrease-flu-fatalities-httpswwwgrassrootshealthnetblogsolar-uvb-exposure-decrease-flu-fatalities><img src=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Grant-1918-1919-flu-by-latitude-300x237.png alt=image><a href=https://www.grassrootshealth.net/blog/solar-uvb-exposure-decrease-flu-fatalities/> <strong>Could More Solar UVB Exposure Decrease Flu Fatalities?</strong></a></h4><p>A general trend can be seen with lower rates of pneumonia as a complication of influenza and influenza fatalities for those locations at lower latitudes within the United States where vitamin D production from UVB is more.
