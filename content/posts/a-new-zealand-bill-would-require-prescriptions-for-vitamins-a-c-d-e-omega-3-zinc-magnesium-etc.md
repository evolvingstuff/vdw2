<p>The proposal to regulate safe natural health products alongside pharmaceutical drugs or ‘biologics’ is entirely unjustified. </p>

<p>Please see further commentary - Dr Guy Hatchard’s article “The New Zealand Government Reaches for Total Medical Control” here:</p>

<p><a href="https://preview.mailerlite.com/q9c4n6f7p4/2127925345054103797/p7n4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://preview.mailerlite.com/q9c4n6f7p4/2127925345054103797/p7n4/</a></p>

<p>“This Bill represents an attempt to impose a modern medical/pharmaceutical straight jacket on the process of medical choice. A straight jacket that will no doubt be administered by people who are unfamiliar with and even opposed to natural medicine. The apparent intention is to drive people towards pharmaceutical-based medicine”.</p>

<p>“A recent EU study found that natural health products are 45,000 times safer than pharmaceutical drugs. The government, however, apparently believes they are unsafe, but where is the evidence? It doesn’t exist”.</p>

<p>Therapeutic Products Bill: Labyrinthine &amp; unaccountable as it exits the starting gate?</p>

<p><a href="https://jrbruning.substack.com/p/therapeutic-products-bill-labyrinthine?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://jrbruning.substack.com/p/therapeutic-products-bill-labyrinthine?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email</a></p>

<p>“Based on policy and governance over the last two years, there is clear evidence that the New Zealand government downgrades and dismisses dietary nutrition in public health. This is despite extensive scientific evidence base demonstrating how health can be protected - multifactorially (i.e. via multiple pathways which are often not only recognised, but required by the human body)”. </p>

<p>“I’ve documented just how far the government will go to push <a href="https://jrbruning.substack.com/p/reframing-risk-redflagging-it-regulatory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a biologic, a gene therapy</a> with a largely unknown toxicity profile through regulatory channels; and just how extensively they will <a href="https://jrbruning.substack.com/p/slippery-hipkins-and-the-official" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avoid reviewing the scientific literature</a> (i.e. accountability) to identify risk pathways. The last 3 years have also shown us the extent to which cheap off-patent, repurposed drugs will be sidelined, and the extent to which nutrition will be ignored. We’ve also seen how <a href="https://jrbruning.substack.com/p/covid-19-in-new-zealand-ethics-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">norms and values - basic public health ethics</a>, have been swept aside and dispensed with.</p>

<p>This Bill informs us that Cabinet believes that technologies such as the mRNA gene ‘therapy’ used in the pandemic, which contained the directions for the body to code (in an uncontrolled manner) for a cardiotoxic, inflammatory spike protein, should be regulated under the same legislation as vitamin C – ascorbic acid or magnesium”.  </p>

<p>There is concern in New Zealand over the implications of this Bill (should it be passed) on the future health and wellbeing of the nation. </p>
