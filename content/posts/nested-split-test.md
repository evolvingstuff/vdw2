[Sci-Hub article on Verge - Feb 2018](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit)

* "Elsevier, for example, boasts a nearly $35 billion market cap. It has reported a nearly 39 percent profit margin for its scientific publishing arm"

* Open Access now (not Sci-Hub) now accounts for  28 % Digital Object Identifiers

* "...many Open Access publishers charge scientists fees — often anywhere from a few hundred dollars up to around two thousand — for processing their articles, whether they’re accepted or not."

* 70 % of peer-review Open Access models do not charge anything

* Researchgatews pressured into taking down 7 million unauthorized copies of their (publishers) papers.

* Sci-Hub has “gained access” to “around 400 universities.”

* "Now, once users pointed Sci-Hub toward an article, the site would check every university proxy server until it found one through which it could download the paper, and would download it automatically."

* " “Access from China and Iran was blocked for some time because Sci-Hub couldn’t serve as many requests as were coming from these countries".

* ".She also made Sci-Hub inaccessible to Americans ( **except those using VPNs** ) — in part because of the number of download requests, but also because she wanted to avoid becoming a target for lawsuits.__
