Aim:

To investigate the association between maternal and neonatal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels and development of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in full term infants.

Methods:

This was a prospective case-control study carried out on 30 neonates with TTN and their mothers and 30 control neonates and their mothers. Levels of 25-OHD were measured in maternal and neonatal blood samples that were obtained in the first 12–24 h of postnatal age.

Results:

Both maternal and neonatal 25-OHD levels in the TTN group were significantly lower compared to the control group (P=0.0001). A negative correlation was observed between neonatal 25-OHD level and average hospital stay (P=0.0001).

Conclusion:

We observed that lower maternal and neonatal vitamin 25-OHD levels were associated with TTN development in full term infants.
