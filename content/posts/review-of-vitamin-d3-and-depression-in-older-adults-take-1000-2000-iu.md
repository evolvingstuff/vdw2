In 2009, the seminal integrative literature review on vitamin D and the occurrence of depression included 17 studies on older adults and determined the relationship between vitamin D and depression to be largely circumstantial. 

Since this publication, 

* 10 studies have assessed the relationship of vitamin D status/supplementation to depression in elders. 

* Six studies indicated a link between vitamin D deficiency, depressive symptoms, and overall psychological health, and 

* 4 studies highlight vitamin D supplementation and the effect on depressive symptoms. 

More studies are needed to confirm a definitive relationship between vitamin D status, supplementation, and effect on depression in geriatric populations.

## An earlier meta-analysis: Depression 2.2X more likely if vitamin D deficient

#### Vitamin D deficiency and depression in adults: systematic review and meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence about the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression, and a systematic assessment of the literature has not been available.

AIMS: To determine the relationship, if any, between vitamin D deficiency and depression.

METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomised controlled trials was conducted.

RESULTS: One case-control study, ten cross-sectional studies and three cohort studies with a total of 31 424 participants were analysed. Lower vitamin D levels were found in people with depression compared with controls (SMD = 0.60, 95% CI 0.23-0.97) and there was an increased odds ratio of depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories in the cross-sectional studies (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.0-1.71). 

The cohort studies showed a significantly increased hazard ratio of depression for the lowest v. highest vitamin D categories ( **HR = 2.21** , 95% CI 1.40-3.49).

CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that low vitamin D concentration is associated with depression, and highlight the need for randomised controlled trials of vitamin D for the prevention and treatment of depression to determine whether this association is causal.
