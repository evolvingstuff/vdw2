## [A person was speculating that appendicitis might be caused by vitamin D deficiency June 2012](http://pandemicsurvivor.com/2012/06/08/pain-in-shades-of-ultra-violet-appendicitis/)

* [Summer has the most acute attacks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22661078)

* [Highest incidence in July](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16817501)

> most in summer,  men got more pain, but women has 12X the number of surgeries, 

> 14% decrease recently (seems unlikely to be caused by vitamin D deficiency)

The phrase "appendicitis season" was used in a Jan 1914 Newspaper - but the article did not state when the season was.

## Reasons that appendicitis is probably not due to vitamin D deficiency

1. while vitamin D was decreasing appendicitis was also decreasing

1. peaks in summer, not spring

>  **But** , perhaps the appendicitis started as a result of:

> Spring ==> low vitamin D ==> Excess Calcium ==> Block appendix 

## Pain of appendicitis, like [other pains](/tags/other-pains.html) might be relieved with vitamin D

No data, just speculation based on analogies 

## [Air Pollution May Raise Appendicitis Risk](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/air-pollution-may-raise-appendicitis-risk/)NY Times July 2013

For each 16 parts per billion increase in ozone concentration the scientists found an 11 to 22 percent increase in ruptured appendix cases.

The short term reduction of vitamin D due to the pollution is probably not the cause of the ruptured appendix.

But the lower vitamin D could be a risk factor in the long term
