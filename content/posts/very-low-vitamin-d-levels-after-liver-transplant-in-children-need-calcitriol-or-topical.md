#### Course of vitamin D levels before and after liver transplantation in pediatric patients

   * The medical community is still amazed that regular vitamin D does not help poor livers.  Regular vitamin D is semi-acivated by the liver into Calcidiol, so if poor liver, little Calcidiol.   **Need use Calcidiol or topical vitamin D** , not oral vitamin D, when the liver is not functioning well

Background: 25-hydroxy VD insufficiency is known in children undergoing LT but the serial post-transplant VD course and supplementation modalities in the peri-transplant period are lacking. We aimed to determine the pre-VD status and the post-transplant VD status course following VD supplementation and to elucidate its relationship with post-transplant outcome parameters such as infection and survival.

Methods: Pre- and post-VD levels were monitored in parallel with interventions to adjust VD levels in LT patients. VD status was categorized as circulating levels <30-21 ng/ml (insufficiency), 20-10 ng/ml (deficiency), and <10 ng/ml (severe deficiency). Patients received  **stoss (300,000 IU)**  VD3 within the pretransplant period if serum levels were <20 ng/ml.

Results: 135 transplanted children were included. The age at LT was 22 months (IQR: 8-60). The pretransplant median VD level was 14 ng/ml. 

 **Despite stoss dose, post-transplant median VD level was** 

* 1.8 ng/ml (day one), 

* 4 ng/ml (week one), 

* 19 ng/ml (month one), 

* 33 ng/ml (month three), 

* 38 ng/ml (months 6-12), and

* 40 ng/ml (month 24). 

After 6 months, VD status reached >30 ng/ml in 98% of patients. Only at pre-LT, higher infection rate (18.7%) in the severe VD deficiency group was observed compared to the VD deficiency group (2.9%, p = .04). Survival was not affected by serum VD levels.

Conclusion: VD levels fell substantially after LT but are rectifiable by stoss dose, which was well tolerated. Only the infection rate was associated with the VD status.
