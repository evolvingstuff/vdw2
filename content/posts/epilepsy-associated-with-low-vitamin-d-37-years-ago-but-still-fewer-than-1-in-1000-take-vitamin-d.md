Two quotes:

* “It has long been known that children with epilepsy are at risk of vitamin D deficiency (Offerman et al. 1979).”

* “. . children admitted with epilepsy only 28% had had vitamin D levels checked, 100% had renal function checked and 100% liver function checked. Of those children whose vitamin D levels were checked 45% had low vitamin d but  **only 0.05% were on vitamin D supplements.** ”
