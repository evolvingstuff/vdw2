 **Summary of 20+ studies** 

1. Loading doses of 300,000 IU Vitamin D have been frequently used for adults

> More than 300,000 IU is sometimes needed for adults

> [infants-Children might only need 10,000 IU per kg](/tags/infants-children-might-only-need-10000-iu-per-kg.html)

1. Loading dose for the ICU should be given in a single day

> An oral dose does not result in a full response for 3+ days

> An [injection](/tags/injection.html) does not result in a full response for several weeks 

1. A [gut-friendly](/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d) form of Vitamin D should be used if patient has poor digestion

> [Nanoemulsion sublingual or topical](/posts/topical-vitamin-d-provides-more-benefits-than-oral-sometimes-many-studies) are fast acting (hours)

> &nbsp; &nbsp;Any form of vitamin D given just before/after surgery is better than none

1.  **All of the above also applies to ICU**  (Intensive Care Unit)

#### DON'T GET SURGERY Unless You Do This First - Dr. Berg video March 2025

 **[YouTube 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA_VgCFnueE)** 

 **Free summary by GLASP AI** 

* The video emphasizes the importance of having sufficient vitamin D levels before any surgery to reduce complications and improve outcomes.

* Surgical procedures themselves can lower vitamin D levels (from an average of 42.7 to 28 in one study mentioned).

* Sufficient vitamin D before surgery helps reduce infection risk, supports immune function, decreases inflammation, lowers cardiovascular complications, and enhances wound healing.

* Low vitamin D is associated with 200% higher post-operative inflammatory markers and up to 8x higher risk of cognitive dysfunction after surgery.

* Some studies have used very high doses of vitamin D before surgery (100,000-600,000 IU) to saturate the body's cells, though these are short-term protocols, not long-term recommendations.

* Vitamin D supports adrenal function during the stress of surgery, helping to regulate the cortisol spike that can increase 4x following surgical procedures.

* The video recommends taking additional vitamin D approximately 3 days before surgery to allow time for cellular absorption.

* Vitamin D influences over 2,000 genes, with about 200 related specifically to adrenal function.
