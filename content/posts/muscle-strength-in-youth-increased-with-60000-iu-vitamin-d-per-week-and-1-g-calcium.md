Abstract Context. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide. Vitamin D supplementation has shown variable effect on skeletal muscle strength in the elderly with hypovitaminosis D. There is a paucity of similar data in young individuals. 

Objective. To study the effect of cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation on muscle strength and energy metabolism in young individuals. 

Subjects. Forty healthy volunteers (24M/16F, mean age (SD) 31.5 +/- (5.0yr) with hypovitaminosis-D were randomized to either oral cholecalciferol (60,000 IU D3/week for eight weeks followed by 60,000 IU/month for four months) with 1g of elemental calcium daily or dual placebos for six months. 

Measurements: Hand-grip and gastro-soleus dynamometry, pinch-grip strength, respiratory pressures, six-minute-walk-test and muscle-energy metabolism on (31)P-magnetic-resonance- spectroscopy were assessed at baseline and after six months. 

Results. The mean serum 25(OH)D in the supplemented and placebo groups at baseline, two and six months were 25.4 +/- 9.9, 94.5 +/- 53.8, 56.0 +/-17.0 nmol/L and 21.1 +/- 9.4, 32.8 +/- 14.4, 29.7 +/- 15.0 nmol/L respectively. The supplemented group gained a handgrip strength of 2.4 kg (95% C.I= 1.2-3.6); gastro-soleus strength of 3.0 Nm (95% C.I.= 0.1-5.9) and walking distance of 15.9 meters (95% C.I= 6.3-25.5) over the placebo group after adjustment for age, gender and respective baseline parameters. Muscle energy parameters were comparable at six months. 

Conclusions. Six months of cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation results in enhanced skeletal muscle strength and physical performance despite no change in muscle energy parameters. 60,000 IU per month of cholecalciferol supplementation could not maintain 25(OH)D levels in the sufficient range.
