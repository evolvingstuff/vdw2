&lt;p>Season of birth, a marker of in utero vitamin D exposure, has been associated with a wide range of health outcomes. Using a dataset of ∼450,000 participants from the UK Biobank study, we aimed to assess the impact of this seasonality on birth weight, age at menarche, adult height and body mass index (BMI). Birth weight, age at menarche and height, but not BMI, were highly significantly associated with season of birth. Individuals born in summer (June–July–August) had higher mean birth weight (P = 8 × 10−10), later pubertal development (P = 1.1 × 10−45) and taller adult height (P = 6.5 × 10−9) compared to those born in all other seasons. Concordantly, those born in winter (December–January–February) showed directionally opposite differences in these outcomes. A secondary comparison of the extreme differences between months revealed higher odds ratios &lt;span>[95% confidence intervals (CI)]&lt;/span> for low birth weight in February vs. September (1.23 &lt;span>[1.15–1.32]&lt;/span>, P = 4.4 × 10−10), for early puberty in September vs. July (1.22 &lt;span>[1.16–1.28]&lt;/span>, P = 7.3 × 10−15) and for short stature in December vs. June (1.09 &lt;span>[1.03–1.17]&lt;/span>, P = 0.006). The above associations were also seen with total hours of sunshine during the second trimester, but not during the first three months after birth. Additional associations were observed with educational attainment; individuals born in autumn vs. summer were more likely to continue in education post age 16 years (P = 1.1 × 10−91) or attain a degree-level qualification (P = 4 × 10−7). However, unlike other outcomes, an abrupt difference was seen between those born in August vs. September, which flank the start of the school year. Our findings provide support for the ‘fetal programming’ hypothesis, refining and extending the impact that season of birth has on childhood growth and development. Whilst other mechanisms may contribute to these associations, these findings are consistent with a possible role of in utero vitamin D exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Health problems are related to birth month</title><link>/posts/health-problems-are-related-to-birth-month.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/health-problems-are-related-to-birth-month.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Anorexia nervosa and Vitamin D - several studies</title><link>/posts/anorexia-nervosa-and-vitamin-d-several-studies.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/anorexia-nervosa-and-vitamin-d-several-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Anorexia Nervosa appears to be associated with&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Association studies form the backbone of biomedical research, with almost every effort in the field ultimately boiling down to a comparison between groups, coupled with some form of statistical test intended to determine whether or not any observed difference is more or less than would be expected by chance. Unfortunately, although the paradigm is powerful and frequently effective, it is often forgotten that false positive association can easily arise if there is any bias or systematic difference in the way in which study subjects are selected into the considered groups. To protect against such confounding, researchers generally try to match cases and controls for extraneous variables thought to correlate with the exposures of interest. However, if seemingly homogenously distributed exposures are actually more heterogeneous than appreciated, then matching may be inadequate and false positive results can still arise. In this review, we will illustrate these fundamental issues by considering the previously proposed relationship between month of birth and multiple sclerosis. This much discussed but false positive association serves as a reminder of just how heterogeneous even easily measured environmental risk factors can be, and how easily case&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Season of birth associated with Pneumonia (10 %) and Multiple Sclerosis (30 %)</title><link>/posts/season-of-birth-associated-with-pneumonia-10-percent-and-multiple-sclerosis-30-percent.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/season-of-birth-associated-with-pneumonia-10-percent-and-multiple-sclerosis-30-percent.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Suicide is a complex behaviour contributing to a significant number of unnecessary deaths worldwide. Accordingly, the quest for suicide risk factors is one of the most intensively developing issues of psychiatric research. In the last few decades a number of interesting results have been published about associations between season of birth (SOB) and several physiological and pathological aspects of human life, while, in regard to neuroscience, several investigations confirmed that SOB is associated with the risk of several major neuropsychiatric disorders and suicide as well. Research concerning the possible causative factors behind these associations were also performed suggesting that&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7 percent less likely to get immune mediated disease if born in the fall</title><link>/posts/7-percent-less-likely-to-get-immune-mediated-disease-if-born-in-the-fall.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/7-percent-less-likely-to-get-immune-mediated-disease-if-born-in-the-fall.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">
