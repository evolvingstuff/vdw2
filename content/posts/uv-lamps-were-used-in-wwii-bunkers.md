"Running the war was a serious business and there was often little time to go outside to stretch one’s legs. Workers sometimes stayed underground for days at a time, kipping down in the dormitories."

"This meant that staff were in danger of suffering from a lack of sunlight, causing a vitamin D deficiency and related health problems."

"One solution used by the bunker’s inhabitants was to use this portable sun lamp."

"Individuals would strip to their underwear, put on protective goggles and stand in front of the lamp to get a dose of UV rays to try to stave off health problems."
