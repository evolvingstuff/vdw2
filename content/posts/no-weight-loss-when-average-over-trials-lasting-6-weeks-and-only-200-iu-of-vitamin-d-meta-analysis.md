The impact of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) supplementation on weight change remains controversial. The objective of this study was to summarize the effects of 25<span>[OH]</span>D supplementation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) on BMI change through a meta-analysis of published clinical trials. 

We completed a systematic review of English articles, using MEDLINE (Ovid, Pubmed) from January 1, 1998 through January 1, 2013. The articles selected focused on 25<span>[OH]</span>D supplementation and body mass index (BMI) in randomized controlled trials (RCTâ€™s). 

The association between 25<span>[OH]</span>D and mean BMI change was estimated utilizing a random effects model. A total of 30 studies were reviewed and  **9 were included in the meta-analysis** . Total participants included 1651 adults (82.6% women and mean age 47.9 years) and mean follow-up ranged between 6 to 196 weeks and mean daily 25<span>[OH]</span>D dose ranged from  **200 IU to 1,110 IU** . Five of the 9 studies included calcium supplementation in both groups. Average baseline BMI was 30.7 and 30.4 kg/m2 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. 

 **Five studies**  suggested a beneficial effect for 25<span>[OH]</span>D supplementation for BMI change whereas 3 studies showed no effect of 25<span>[OH]</span>D supplementation on BMI change, and one showed a non-perceptible change. Meta-analysis of BMI values at end of trial showed no statistically significant difference in BMI change by use of 25<span>[OH]</span>D supplementation. Based on existing published trials, oral 25<span>[OH]</span>D supplementation does not significantly impact BMI change.
