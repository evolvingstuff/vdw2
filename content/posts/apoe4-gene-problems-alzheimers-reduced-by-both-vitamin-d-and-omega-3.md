* Includes 3 minute video

* “Tobacco plus the APOE4 gene presses the fast-forward button towards Alzheimer's disease”

* “There were a variety of other studies that showed that people with two copies of the APOE4 gene should possibly start thinking about what their vitamin D level is.<sup>[7]</sup> Having an elevated vitamin D level—<span>[or even high-normal]</span> to, say, 50 to 70 in one study—actually may be even more protective for people with two copies of the APOE4 gene.”

* “…. recent studies<sup>[9]</sup> have actually shown that people with the APOE4 gene may respond preferentially to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. However, the key here is that it takes 2.5 years for the amount of omega-3s to really replenish the brain.<sup>[10]</sup>”
