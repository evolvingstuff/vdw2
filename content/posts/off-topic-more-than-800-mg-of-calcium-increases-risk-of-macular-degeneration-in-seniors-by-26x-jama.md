#### Self-reported Calcium Supplementation and Age-Related Macular Degeneration ONLINE FIRST

JAMA Ophthalmol. Published online April 09, 2015. doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.0514 Caitlin L. M. Kakigi, BA1; Kuldev Singh, MD, MPH2; Sophia Y. Wang, MD3; Wayne T. Enanoria, PhD, MPH4; Shan C. Lin, MD1

Importance  Despite widespread use of calcium supplementation among elderly people, little is known about the association between such consumption and the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in the United States.

Objective  To investigate the association between self-reported supplementary calcium consumption and the prevalence of AMD in a representative US sample.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional study included 3191 participants 40 years and older in the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who were evaluated for the presence or absence of AMD by fundus photography. Participants were interviewed regarding use of  **dietary supplements and antacids**  during the 30-day period preceding enrollment. Self-reported supplementary intake of calcium was aggregated and divided into quintiles. Fundus photographs were graded for the presence or absence of AMD. Information regarding demographics, comorbidities, and health-related behaviors was obtained via interview. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to determine the odds of an AMD diagnosis among participants in each quintile of self-reported calcium vs participants not self-reporting supplementary calcium consumption after adjusting for confounders.

Interventions  Self-reported use of calcium supplements.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Presence or absence of AMD by fundus photography.

Results  A total of 248 participants (7.8%) were diagnosed with AMD. Mean ages were 67.2 years for those with AMD and 55.8 for those without AMD. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, study participants who self-reported consumption of more than 800 mg/d of supplementary calcium were found to have higher odds of an AMD diagnosis based on fundus photography evaluation compared with those not self-reporting supplementary calcium consumption (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25-2.75). 

The association between self-reported supplementary calcium intake and AMD was stronger in older than younger individuals (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.52-4.54). 

A clear dose-response association between the quintiles of self-reported supplementary calcium intake and AMD was not established.

Conclusions and Relevance  Self-reported supplementary calcium consumption is associated with increased prevalence of AMD, with the findings suggesting a threshold rather than a dose-response relationship. The stronger association in older individuals may be due to relatively longer duration of calcium supplementation in older individuals.

 **VitaminDWiki comments** 

* We have said for 5 years that a person should take less than 750 mg of Calcium

* The problem might be eliminated if take Vitamin K2 and Magnesium
