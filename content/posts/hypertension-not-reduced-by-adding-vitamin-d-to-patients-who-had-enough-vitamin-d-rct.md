Previous randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation and blood pressure (BP) mainly have given vitamin D for short periods (<6 months) or at low doses (400 IU per day). This study aims to determine whether long-term high-dose vitamin D taken for 18 months lowers BP. Adults were recruited from a healthcare organization or university into a double-blind controlled trial and randomized to receive either vitamin D3 200 000 IU for 2 months followed by 100 000 IU monthly up to 18 months (n=161) or placebo (n=161). BP was measured at baseline, 5, and 18 months. Subjects had a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (9.7) years, 75% were women, and 94% were of European ancestry (white). 

Mean (SD) 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 changed from  **73**  (22) nmol/L at baseline to  **124**  (28) nmol/L at 18 months in the vitamin D group, and from 71 (22) nmol/L to 56 (22) nmol/L in the placebo group. Mean BP was similar for the vitamin D and placebo groups at baseline (123.4/76.3 versus 122.6/75.6 mm Hg; respectively). 

The mean change (95% confidence interval) in BP at 18 months minus baseline in the vitamin D group compared with placebo group was 

* −0.6 (−2.8 to 1.6) mm Hg for systolic (P=0.61) and 

* 0.5 (−1.1, 2.2) mm Hg for diastolic (P=0.53). 

Long-term vitamin D supplementation, which increased mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration >100 nmol/L for 18 months, had no effect on systolic or diastolic BP in predominantly white, healthy adults without severe vitamin D deficiency. Beneficial effects on BP cannot be ruled out for other populations.
