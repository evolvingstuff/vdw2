* "Researchers from King’s College London also showed an “ultra low dose” of glyphosate-based herbicides was damaging to the liver"

   * "The [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39328) involved glyphosate exposures of 4 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day, which is 75,000 and 437,500 times below EU and U.S. permitted levels, respectively"

* "Those with a more severe form of NAFLD called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, had significantly higher residues of glyphosate in their urine...."

* "A number of animal studies have linked glyphosate to liver damage, including one that dates back to 1979, which showed the chemical could disrupt mitochondria in rat livers"

* "Glyphosate is also a patented antibiotic"
