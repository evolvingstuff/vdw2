## We never cease to be amazed at the stupidity of some meta-analysis

Sometimes they take no account of the IUs of vitamin D taken by each of the trials they are analyzing

 **Example:  Vitamin D and gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

European Journal of Internal Medicine 2012

The authors ignore that there was no statistical difference in vitamin D levels in three trials

 **Farrant, Makgoba, and Baker stated that they had NO statistical difference between the two arms** 

 **YET, this meta-analysis included the data from those trials**

### If we ignore the data from those 3 trials it appears that the odd ratio would increase to about  **2.4**  from 1.6

If the authors had actually gotten around to consider the vitamin D levels actually measured by each of the trials 

and weighted the data based of each based on the vitamin D levels (rather than no weighting at all)  

the odds ratio would most likely had been far higher - **<span style="color:#F00;">perhaps  >3</span>** 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Farrant study is attached at the bottom of this page</span>** 

## Notes:

1. The vitamin D levels were so low that they did not detect any difference in Gestational Diabetes

1. The vitamin D levels were so low that they did not detect any difference in neonate size

1. They compared ALL mothers to those mothers less than 20 nanograms,

> rather than the conventional comparison of those above to those below some level, say 20 nanograms

1. Something is strange with the Farrant study. 

> The women taking vitamin D supplements had lower level blood levels of vitamin D

> Wonder if the mothers were taking vitamin D2 instead of vitamin D3
