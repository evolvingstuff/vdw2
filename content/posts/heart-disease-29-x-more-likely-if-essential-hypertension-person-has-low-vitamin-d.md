Background: Vitamin D deficiency is proposed as a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). An inverse relation was observed between serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D level and incidence of hypertension. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D in improvement of CHD risk-stratification in patients with hypertension.

Methods: In this cohort, we followed 1586 patients with essential hypertension (1078 diabetic and 508 non-diabetic) for 8.5 years. Physician-adjudicated first hard CHD event was the primary outcome. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the association between 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D quartiles and incident CHD. 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D was also added to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Net-Reclassification-Improvement (NRI) and Integrated-Discriminant-Improvement (IDI) were used to examine improved reclassification.

Results: During follow-up, 176 events were recorded. Patients in the lowest quartile of 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D experienced the most number of hard CHD events. A significant linear trend was observed in hazard ratios (HR) of incident hard CHD events in 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D quartiles which remained significant after multiple adjustments for conventional CHD risk-factors (HRs in full-adjusted model: 

* 2.87 <span>[1.76–4.70]</span> for 1st quartile, 

* 2.31 <span>[1.39–3.83]</span> for 2nd quartile and 

* 1.87 <span>[1.15–3.03]</span> for 3rd quartile,

> compared with the highest quartile; p-for-trend<0.001). 

Addition of 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D to FRS could improve CHD risk-estimation (relative-IDI = 15%, p-value<0.001). Addition of 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D to FRS successfully reclassified 33% <span>[18–49]</span> of patients with hypertension among CHD risk groups (p-value<0.001).

Conclusion: We observed that serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D is independently associated with future hard CHD events and improves its prediction in patients with essential hypertension. Addition of serum 25-Hydroxy-Vitamin-D to CHD risk-estimation models may have additive values.

#### CHD 2.9 X more likely if hypertension and very low vitamin D – Dec 2017

 **Effect modification of hypertension on the association of vitamin D deficiency with severity of coronary stenosis.** 

Blood Press. 2017 Dec 18:1-7. [doi: 10.1080/08037051.2017.1416951.](https://doi.org/10.1080/08037051.2017.1416951.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

AIMS:

There may exist an effect modification of hypertension on the relation of vitamin D deficiency with cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate this interaction on coronary heart disease.

METHODS:

We investigated 348 consecutive patients (mean age 62.4 ± 10.5 years; 56.3% male) who underwent coronary angiography because of chest discomfort at our heart center. Serum 25-OH vitamin D was also detected by ELISA method in these patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odd ratios (ORs) of CHD across vitamin D levels in hypertensives and normotensives, respectively.

RESULTS:

We found the multivariable-adjusted ORs of CHD in the bottom(≤8.5 ng/ml) and middle tertiles (8.5-13 ng/ml) of 25-OH vitamin D were 2.86 (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 1.38, 5.92) and 1.63 (0.83, 3.20), respectively, compared with those in top tertiles (>13ng/ml) among hypertensives (Ptrend=0.005). In contrast, the corresponding ORs of the above two groups were 0.88 (0.28, 2.74) and 1.23 (0.42, 4.00), respectively, in the normotensives (Ptrend = 0.800; Peffect modification = 0.020). The multivariable-adjusted OR of CHD in patients with severe hypovitaminosis D (<10 ng/ml) versus those with higher vitamin D (≧10 ng/ml) was also greater in hypertensives (2.76; 95% CI: 1.51, 5.04) than that in normotensives (0.92; 95% CI: 0.37, 2.33; Peffect modification=0.013). Similar results were observed when Gensini Score was treated as a dependent variable.

CONCLUSION:

Our finding suggests the presence of hypertension may modify the association of vitamin D deficiency with severity of coronary stenosis.
