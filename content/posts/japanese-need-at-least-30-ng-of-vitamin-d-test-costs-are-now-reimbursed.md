 **The global trend had been to stop reinbursing Vitamin D tests** 

 **There had been a 10X to 80X increase in requests for Vitamin D tests** 

 **Governments wanted to reduce rest costs, so many have stopped reinbursement**

Vitamin D is indispensable for the maintenance of bone and mineral health. Inadequate vitamin D action increases the risk for various musculoskeletal/mineral events including 

* fracture, 

* fall, 

* secondary hyperparathyroidism, 

* diminished response to antiresorptives, 

* rickets/osteomalacia, and 

* hypocalcemia. 

Its most common cause in recent years is vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency, clinically defined by a low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level. Guidelines for vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency defined by serum 25(OH)D concentrations have been published all over the world. In Japan, however, the information on the associations between serum 25(OH)D and bone and mineral disorders has not been widely shared among healthcare providers, partly because **<span style="color:#00F;">its measurement had not been reimbursed with national medical insurance policy until August 2016</span>** . We have set out to collect and analyze Japanese data on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and bone and mineral events. Integrating these domestic data and published guidelines worldwide, here, we present the following assessment criteria for vitamin D sufficiency/insufficiency/deficiency using serum 25(OH)D level in Japan. (1) Serum 25(OH)D level equal to or above  **30 ng/ml**  is considered to be vitamin D sufficient. (2) Serum 25(OH)D level less than 30 ng/ml but not less than 20 ng/ml is considered to be vitamin D insufficient. (3) Serum 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/ml is considered to be vitamin D deficient. We believe that these criteria will be clinically helpful in the assessment of serum 25(OH)D concentrations and further expect that they will form a basis for the future development of guidelines for the management of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency.
