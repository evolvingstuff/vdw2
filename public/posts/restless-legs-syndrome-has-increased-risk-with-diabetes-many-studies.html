The diagnosis of RLS was performed according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group consensus criteria. The RLS and PSQI instruments were conducted on 871 patients with T2DM. Good sleep quality was defined as PSQI score &lt;5. RLS severity was assessed by the Restless Legs Syndrome-6 Scales (RLS-6). The scale development and validation was carried out using Rasch measurement model.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>The prevalence of RLS was 22.8% including 60.3% of females and 39.7% of males. This study showed significant differences between RLS and no RLS patients with respect to their age (years), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), physical activity, smoking habit, sheesha smoking, income, and sleeping quality with PSQI. Also, the analysis presented that statistically significant differences between both RLS and no RLS reported sleep complaints including difficulty falling asleep, inadequate sleep, anytime fatigue, and leg discomfort. There were statistically significant differences between RLS and no RLS patients regarding hypoglycemia, numbness in legs, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy high blood pressure, depression, stroke, anemia, diabetic foot, ulcer, arthritis, respiratory disease, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease. Furthermore, there were statistically significant differences between RLS and no RLS concerning the number of sleeping hours, wake-up time (AM), sleeping time (PM), BMI (kg/m2), HbA1c, vitamin D, calcium, creatinine, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, uric acid, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>This study confirms positive relation and high prevalence of RLS among patients with T2DM visiting primary healthcare. The results suggest that physical activity is associated with a better perception of functional capacity and pain in diabetic patients with RLS, and thus a more active lifestyle should be encouraged.</p><hr><h4 id=restless-leg-syndrome-in-diabetics-compared-with-normal-controls--may-2014>Restless Leg Syndrome in Diabetics Compared with Normal Controls – May 2014</h4><p>Sleep Disord. 2014; 2014: 871751. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/871751.>doi: 10.1155/2014/871751.</a> PMCID: PMC4033537, PMID: 24895540</p><p>Mehdi Zobeiri 1 ,* and Azita Shokoohi 2</p><p>Introduction. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder which is characterized by urge to move the legs accompanied by disturbing and uncomfortable leg sensation during night and rest. This common condition affects 7–10% of general population and is frequently unrecognized, misdiagnosed, and poorly managed. Several clinical conditions like diabetes have been associated with secondary form of RLS. This study analyzed the frequency and possible risk factor for RLS development in diabetic patient.</p><p>Material and Methods. This descriptive case-control study was done on 140 consecutive outpatient diabetics and age, sex, and body mass index matched control group. RLS was diagnosed by criteria of the International RLS Study Group. Results. Prevalence of RLS was 28.6% in diabetes and 7.1% in control group (P = 0.001). Sex difference was not significant and with rising duration of diabetes prevalence of RLS was not increased.</p><p>Discussion. With regarding significant association between RLS and diabetes and its negative impact on quality of life/health outcome/sleep/daytime activity/cognitive function/ and mental state of diabetic patient/higher awareness of RLS among physicians and related health worker suggested.</p><hr><h4 id=restless-legs-syndrome-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus--feb-2019>Restless legs syndrome in type 2 diabetes mellitus – Feb 2019</h4><p>Primary Care Diabetes, VOL 13, ISSUE 1, P87-91, FEB 01, 2019; <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2018.08.006>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2018.08.006</a></p><p>Seydahmet Akın, Cem Bölük, Ülkü Türk Börü, Tuğçe Gezer, Fatma Gülhan Şahbaz, Özcan Keskin</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul><li><p>Restless legs syndrome is more common in type-2 DM patients than in general Turkish population.</p></li><li><p>Polyneuropathy is not the only cause of this height.</p></li><li><p>Duration of diabetes and insulin use have impact on development of RLS.</p></li></ul><p>Aims</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of restless leg syndrome (RLS) in type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and to determine the risk factors.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Patients were recruited from the Dr. Lütfi Kırdar Kartal Training and Research Hospital Diabetes Center. Patients between 18–80 years of age and meeting a minimum 5 years diagnosis of type-2 DM were included. All patients were examined by the same neurologist in terms of having RLS. The diagnosis was made according to the updated International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group consensus criteria. Mimicking conditions such as myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis, leg cramps, positional discomfort and habitual foot tapping were carefully investigated and excluded. Laboratory data, insulin use, family history and other related co-morbidities connected to RLS patients were recorded. RLS severity assessment was scored and recorded.</p><p>Results</p><p>318 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of RLS in type-2 DM patients was found to be 28.3%. RLS prevalence in females was 33.3% and 20.6% in males. 39 patients (43.3%) had a family history of RLS. 43 patients with RLS had a co-morbidity link with RLS. Any co-morbidity linked to RLS was not seen in 47 patients. The prevalence rate of RLS in patients without co-morbidities was 17.1%. Mean duration of DM in patients with RLS was 15.6 ± 6.7 years while in DM patients without RLS was 13.7 ± 6.3 years. The relationship between RLS and the duration of diabetes was found to be statically significant. (p = 0.025). 68 (75.6%) of patients diagnosed with RLS were treated with insulin. A statistical significance was found in the development of RLS and insulin usage (p = 0.035).</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>This is the first study which shows the RLS prevalence and risk factors in Turkish type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. The results indicated that RLS is much more frequent in DM patients even after excluding polyneuropathy than in general Turkish population. The duration of diabetes and insulin use are related to RLS.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>brain</span>
