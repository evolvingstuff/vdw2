#### Considering: [Increasing the vitamin D level of all Canadians to 40 ng would save 6 to 18 billion dollars a year â€“ Grant Nov 2016](/posts/increasing-the-vitamin-d-level-of-all-canadians-to-40-ng-would-save-6-to-18-bill-rs-a-year-grant)

It estimated at the medical cost savings from just 7 health problems by an average of 20%

* Cancer, Cardiovascular, Dementia, Multiple Sclerosis, Osteoporosis, Respiratory infections

Since there were 36 million Canadians at the time, the medical cost savings would have been  **$166 to $500 per person** 

Adjusting for inflation from 2016 to 2023 by [1.27 X](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) 

Range of medical cost savings for getting to 40 ng of vitamin D in 2023 dollars is  **$210 to $635 per person** 

Vitamin D has been proven to reduce another 21 health problems

* Asthma, Gut, Autism, Fibromyalgia, Osteoarthritis, Sepsis, Dental, Back Pain, Allergy, Depression, colds, Pregnancy (pre-term, miscarriage, stillbirth, reduced IVF @ $150/birth), flu, faster surgery recovery, Stroke, COPD, Obesity.

We conservatively assume that decreasing these 21 health will decrease the medical cost by 20%:  **$252 to $762** 

We assume that increasing the vitamin D level from 40 ng to > 60 ng would decrease medical costs by another 20%   **$320 to $914** 

$200/year total cost for supplementation

$80/year Vitamin D (various dose sizes and types), Vitamin K2, and Magnesium (retail prices) all are retail prices

$10/year  Vitamin D tests (1 every 4 years on average) ($40 retail price)

$130/year distribution, updating database, marketing, education, misc

 **Thus the Return on Investment ranges from 1.6X to 4.5X**

#### The ROI DOES NOT consider non-medical cost savings from additional Vitamin D:

 **Employeer:** 

* reduced sick leave, 

* improved productivity due to fewer headaches, colds, flu, obesity, 

* reduced need to hire and train a replacement employee (if the employee died or was disabled)

 **Person:** 

* reduced cost of medical travel

* reduced expensive drugs

* increased income (was not disabled)

* less time spent on caregiving (which sometimes requires quitting their job)

 **Government:** 

* reduction in # of people on disability (8% of Icelanders are on disability)

* increased taxes for people fully engaged in work vs. on disability

#### The ROI DOES NOT consider the cost savings due to Magnesium or Vitamin K2

 **Magnesium reduces** 

Hypertension, stress, headaches, diabetes, restless legs, hip fracture, heart disease, constipation

 **Vitamin K2-7 reduces**
