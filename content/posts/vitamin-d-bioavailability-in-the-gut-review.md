| Vitamin E competes with Vitamin D  | -15% |
| Vitamin D from meat  | -40% |
| High fiber diet  | half life -30% <br> (19 days vs 27 days) |
| Phytosterols  | -16% to -36% |
| Vitamin A | -30% |
| Vitamin E | - ? % |
| Fat substitute: olestra | - ? % |
| Gut-friendly forms | > ? % |
| Gastric bypass surgery | -30% |**

Vitamin D refers to a group of secosteroid compounds and recognized as the antirachitic vitamin, as it counters rickets, mineral desorption from fully-grown bones (Osteodistrophy), bone, joint disorders, and fragility of bones. On one hand, there is scarcity of vitamin D rich food while on other hand a number of factors negotiate its absorption efficiency in human  **gastrointestinal tract (GIT)** . 

These factors include 

* variations in the physiochemical state of the vitamin D (molecular forms, potency and their physiological linkages), the 

* complexity of food matrix (the amount and type of fatty acids, dietary fibers and presence/absence of vitamin D enhancer and inhibitor), and its 

* interaction of other fat soluble compounds with vitamin D as well as the 

* host-associated factors (age, disease, surgery, obesity, genetic variation etc.). 

It is hypothesized that the bioavailability of vitamin D in GIT is compromised if there changes within these factors. 

Present article is intended to review the contribution of these factors anticipated to be influencing vitamin D absorption in GIT.
