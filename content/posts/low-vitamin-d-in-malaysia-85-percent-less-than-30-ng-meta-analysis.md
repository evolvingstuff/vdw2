#### Vitamin D insufficiency is high in Malaysia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on vitamin D status in Malaysia

Front Nutr . 2022 Nov 18;9:1050745. [doi: 10.3389/fnut.2022.1050745](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.1050745)

Purpose: To estimate the vitamin D status of participants residing in Malaysia.

Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and MyJurnal were searched up to June 2022 without language restrictions. Studies that reported the 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations and defined their cut-off for deficiency or insufficiency from healthy participants residing in Malaysia were included. The random effects model was used to pool vitamin D status using established cut-offs of <30, <50, and <75 nmol/L according to age group.

Results: From 299 studies screened, 32 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

The pooled proportion for 

* <30 nmol/L was 21% (95% CI 9-36, n = 2,438 from 10 studies), while the pooled proportion 

* <50 nmol/L was 64% (95% CI 56-72, n = 13,977 from 30 studies), and 

* <75 nmol/L was 85% (95% CI 61-100, n = 1,376 from five studies). 

Heterogeneity was high (I2 ranged from 98-99%). Higher proportions of vitamin D insufficiency (defined as <50 nmol/L) were found in participants living in the urban areas (compared to rural areas), in females (compared to males), and in Malays and Malaysian Indians (compared to Malaysian Chinese) ethnicities.

Conclusion: More than half of Malaysians have insufficient vitamin D levels, despite being a country that is close to the equator. We strongly urge prompt public health measures to improve the vitamin D status in Malaysia.
