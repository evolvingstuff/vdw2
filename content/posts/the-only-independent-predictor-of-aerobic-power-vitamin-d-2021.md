Background: The impact of vitamin D on musculoskeletal health is well-established, although its influence on physical performance is unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the impact of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) concentrations with maximal aerobic power of professional indoor athletes.

Results: A total of 112 male professional athletes were included in this cross-sectional study, consisting of  **88 handball and 24 ice hockey players** . The maximal aerobic power was assessed with a standardized cycling ergometer test. Athletes were assigned to two groups according to their 25-OH vitamin D status: insufficient (< 30 ng/mL) and sufficient (> 30 ng/mL). Thirty-four players (30.4%) displayed insufficient (21.9 ± 5.9 ng/mL) and 78 (69.6%) sufficient 25-OH vitamin D concentrations (41.6 ± 8.6 ng/mL). Athletes with sufficient levels achieved a higher maximal aerobic power (3.9 ± 0.9 vs. 3.5 ± 0.8 W/kg, p = 0.03) compared to those with insufficient levels.

Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of 25-OH vitamin D insufficiency in  **professional indoor athletes** , even in summer. Insufficient 25-OH vitamin D concentrations were associated with lower maximal aerobic power in male professional indoor athletes. Further, the 25-OH vitamin D concentration was identified as the  **only independent predictor of maximal aerobic power in these athletes** , highlighting the impact of 25-OH vitamin D on physical performance. Therefore, 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of > 30 ng/mL should be maintained to ensure optimal physical performance in these athletes.
