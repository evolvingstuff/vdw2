Aim:? The relationship between depression in adolescents and vitamin D was studied in a case-series which included effects of vitamin D supplementation.

Methods:? Serum 25OH vitamin D (25OHD) levels in 54 Swedish depressed adolescents were investigated. 

Subjects with vitamin D deficiency were given vitamin D3 over three months (n=48).

To evaluate well-being and symptoms related to depression and vitamin D status the WHO-5 well-being scale, 

The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ-S), and a vitamin D deficiency scale were used.

Results:? Mean serum 25OHD in the depressed adolescents was 41 at baseline and 91 nmol/L (p<0.001) after supplementation.

Basal 25OHD levels correlated positively to well-being (p<0.05).

After vitamin D supplementation 

* well-being increased (p<0.001) 

and there was a significant improvement in seven of the nine items in the vitamin D deficiency scale; in 

* depressed feeling (p<0.001), 

* irritability (p<0.05), (p<0.001), 

* tiredness (p<0.001), 

* mood swings (p<0.01), 

* sleep difficulties (p<0.01), 

* weakness (p<0.05), 

* ability to concentrate (p<0.05) and 

* pain (p<0.05). 

There was a significant amelioration of depression according to the MFQ-S (p<0.05)

Conclusion:? This study showed low levels of vitamin D in 54 depressed adolescents, positive correlation between vitamin D and well-being, 

and improved symptoms related to depression and vitamin D deficiency after vitamin D supplementation.
