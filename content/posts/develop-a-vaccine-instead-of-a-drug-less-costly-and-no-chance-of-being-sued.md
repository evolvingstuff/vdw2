* "Recent surveys reveal that 20 percent of Americans think vaccines may be unsafe and 45 percent are not sure."

   * :There has been almost a 10 percent decline in public confidence in vaccine safety over the past decade:

* "There are only two laws that require American citizens to risk their lives."

1. Miltary Draft

1. state law requiring all healthy children to risk their lives in a war that doctors declared on microbes two centuries ago

* "..Congress gave doctors a broad liability shield in 1987 similar to the one they gave to vaccine manufacturers in 1986 to protect them from most vaccine injury lawsuits"

>  **US govt has so far paid out $4 billion - but manufactures and doctors have paid out $0**
