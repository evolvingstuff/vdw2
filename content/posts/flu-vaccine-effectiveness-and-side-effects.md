#### Over $4 Billion paid out in US vaccine compensations as of June 2018

 **[Zero Tolerance Vaccine Laws in America: Will You Defend Vaccine Freedom?](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/zero-tolerance-vaccine-laws-america-will-you-defend-vaccine-freedom) GreenMedInfo** 

* "Recent surveys reveal that 20 percent of Americans think vaccines may be unsafe and 45 percent are not sure."

   * :There has been almost a 10 percent decline in public confidence in vaccine safety over the past decade:

* "There are only two laws that require American citizens to risk their lives."

1. Miltary Draft

1. state law requiring all healthy children to risk their lives in a war that doctors declared on microbes two centuries ago

* "..Congress gave doctors a broad liability shield in 1987 similar to the one they gave to vaccine manufacturers in 1986 to protect them from most vaccine injury lawsuits"

>  **US govt has so far paid out $4 billion - but manufactures and doctors have paid out $0** 

#### About 2 in 3 US adults do not get annual flu vaccine
