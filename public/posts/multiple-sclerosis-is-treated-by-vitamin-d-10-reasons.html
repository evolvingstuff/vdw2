#### Will there be Enough Evidence to offer Vitamin D Supplementation to Patients with Multiple Sclerosis in 2024?

Journal of Neurology Research Reviews &amp; Reports doi.org/10.47363/JNRRR/2024(6)204

This narrative overview discusses the scientific findings of the biochemical and metabolic effect of vitamin D on multiple sclerosis up to 2024 with selected targets.

Since the clinical outcome of multiple sclerosis cannot be predicted in individual patients and there may still be a phase of “success and failure”, vitamin D as an add-on therapy could make an early and lasting contribution to the control of dysregulatory inflammatory responses. . As an additional therapy to disease modifying therapies (currently 20 drugs are available, for example ocrelizumab, ofatumumab,ublituximab, rituximab, natalizumab), the B cell kinetics and radiological activity could also be influenced.Some negative vitamin D supplementation studies with zero results could be viewed retrospectively in a more differentiated way through the findings of the three immunologically different phenotypes of multiple sclerosis and with an accentuation of (severe) obesity. This new classification will open up an individualized therapeutic strategy through the targeted immunological effect of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D 3. The relationship between high body mass index and response to vitamin D supplementation and metabolism and the weighting in supplementation studies will become more important in studies.

In an international consensus, daily oral cholecalciferol is preferred due to its safety and minimal need for monitoring in autoimmune diseases. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D in serum is the recognized biomarker for vitamin D status. A connection between vitamin D status and the immune system is recognized. Genetically predicted low levels of 25(OH)D increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis in adolescence or adulthood.

The findings of the complex pathobiological mechanisms of vitamin D through the immunomodulatory effects on autoimmune diseases in general and on multiple sclerosis in particular in 2024 justify integrating vitamin D supplementation into the multimodal approach to personalized medicine without the risk of significant side effects.

#### Asked Perplexity AI: Why does the attached study believe that Vitamin D can treat MS?

Asked on the comprehensive review provided in the attached study, there are several key reasons why the authors believe vitamin D supplementation can be beneficial for treating multiple sclerosis (MS):

1. Immunomodulatory effects: Vitamin D, particularly its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), has significant immunomodulatory effects on both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It can suppress inflammatory responses and promote regulatory T cell function, which is relevant to MS pathophysiology.

1. Impact on MS risk and disease activity: Higher vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of developing MS and reduced disease activity in established MS.

1. Effects on specific immune cells: Vitamin D influences various immune cells involved in MS pathology, including:

&gt; - Suppressing pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells

&gt; - Promoting regulatory T cells

&gt; - Modulating B cell and NK cell functions

1. Neuroprotective effects: Vitamin D may have neuroprotective properties, potentially reducing brain atrophy and supporting neuronal health[.

1. Influence on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): Vitamin D supplementation can alter immune responses to EBV, which is strongly associated with MS risk.

1. Addressing common deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in MS patients and the general population, making supplementation a logical intervention.

1. Safety profile: High-dose vitamin D supplementation is generally well-tolerated and safe, with minimal side effects compared to other MS treatments.

1. Potential synergy with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs): Vitamin D may enhance the effects of standard MS treatments and help address some of their limitations.

1. Impact on MS symptoms: Vitamin D supplementation may help alleviate common MS symptoms like fatigue and depression.

1. Early intervention potential: Vitamin D could be beneficial in early stages of MS or even in the prodromal phase, potentially delaying or preventing disease progression.

While the authors acknowledge that some studies have shown mixed results, they argue that the  **totality of evidence, including pathophysiological mechanisms and observational data, supports the use of vitamin D supplementation as part of a comprehensive approach to MS treatment** . They emphasize the need for adequate dosing and early intervention to achieve optimal effects.

!!!!Will there be Enough Evidence to offer Vitamin D Supplementation to Patients with Multiple Sclerosis in 2024?
Journal of Neurology Research Reviews &amp; Reports doi.org/10.47363/JNRRR/2024(6)204
Hans Klaus Goischke Internal medicine, rehabilitation, social medicine, D-97769

This narrative overview discusses the scientific findings of the biochemical and metabolic effect of vitamin D on multiple sclerosis up to 2024 with selected targets.
Since the clinical outcome of multiple sclerosis cannot be predicted in individual patients and there may still be a phase of “success and failure”, vitamin D as an add-on therapy could make an early and lasting contribution to the control of dysregulatory inflammatory responses. . As an additional therapy to disease modifying therapies (currently 20 drugs are available, for example ocrelizumab, ofatumumab,ublituximab, rituximab, natalizumab), the B cell kinetics and radiological activity could also be influenced.Some negative vitamin D supplementation studies with zero results could be viewed retrospectively in a more differentiated way through the findings of the three immunologically different phenotypes of multiple sclerosis and with an accentuation of (severe) obesity. This new classification will open up an individualized therapeutic strategy through the targeted immunological effect of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D 3. The relationship between high body mass index and response to vitamin D supplementation and metabolism and the weighting in supplementation studies will become more important in studies.
In an international consensus, daily oral cholecalciferol is preferred due to its safety and minimal need for monitoring in autoimmune diseases. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D in serum is the recognized biomarker for vitamin D status. A connection between vitamin D status and the immune system is recognized. Genetically predicted low levels of 25(OH)D increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis in adolescence or adulthood.
The findings of the complex pathobiological mechanisms of vitamin D through the immunomodulatory effects on autoimmune diseases in general and on multiple sclerosis in particular in 2024 justify integrating vitamin D supplementation into the multimodal approach to personalized medicine without the risk of significant side effects.

!!!!Asked Perplexity AI: Why does the attached study believe that Vitamin D can treat MS?
Asked on the comprehensive review provided in the attached study, there are several key reasons why the authors believe vitamin D supplementation can be beneficial for treating multiple sclerosis (MS):
#Immunomodulatory effects: Vitamin D, particularly its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), has significant immunomodulatory effects on both the innate and adaptive immune systems. It can suppress inflammatory responses and promote regulatory T cell function, which is relevant to MS pathophysiology.
#Impact on MS risk and disease activity: Higher vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of developing MS and reduced disease activity in established MS.
#Effects on specific immune cells: Vitamin D influences various immune cells involved in MS pathology, including:
+ - Suppressing pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells
+ - Promoting regulatory T cells
+ - Modulating B cell and NK cell functions
#Neuroprotective effects: Vitamin D may have neuroprotective properties, potentially reducing brain atrophy and supporting neuronal health[.
#Influence on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): Vitamin D supplementation can alter immune responses to EBV, which is strongly associated with MS risk.
#Addressing common deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in MS patients and the general population, making supplementation a logical intervention.
#Safety profile: High-dose vitamin D supplementation is generally well-tolerated and safe, with minimal side effects compared to other MS treatments.
#Potential synergy with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs): Vitamin D may enhance the effects of standard MS treatments and help address some of their limitations.
#Impact on MS symptoms: Vitamin D supplementation may help alleviate common MS symptoms like fatigue and depression.
#Early intervention potential: Vitamin D could be beneficial in early stages of MS or even in the prodromal phase, potentially delaying or preventing disease progression.
While the authors acknowledge that some studies have shown mixed results, they argue that the __totality of evidence, including pathophysiological mechanisms and observational data, supports the use of vitamin D supplementation as part of a comprehensive approach to MS treatment__. They emphasize the need for adequate dosing and early intervention to achieve optimal effects.
