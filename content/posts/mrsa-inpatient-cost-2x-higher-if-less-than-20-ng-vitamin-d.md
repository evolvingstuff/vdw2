Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infections are frequently associated with hospitalization and increased healthcare costs. 

Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to increased costs for patients with these infections and there is evidence that vitamin D may have an antimicrobial role. 

To evaluate the role of vitamin D deficiency in the costs incurred with these infections, we studied the relationship of serum 25(OH)D levels to healthcare costs in veterans in the southeastern United States. 

Patients with both infections were vitamin D deficient to a similar extent and so were combined for further analysis. Vitamin D deficient patients had higher costs and service utilization than those who were not vitamin D deficient. 

Those with vitamin D deficiency had higher inpatient costs compared to the non-deficient group, and this difference was across most categories except for the number of inpatient hospitalizations or total number of days as an inpatient. 

Vitamin D deficiency was not significantly related to outpatient cost or service utilization parameters. 

We conclude that vitamin D deficiency is intimately linked to adverse healthcare costs in veterans with MRSA and P. aeruginosa infections. Vitamin D status should be assayed in patients with these infections.
