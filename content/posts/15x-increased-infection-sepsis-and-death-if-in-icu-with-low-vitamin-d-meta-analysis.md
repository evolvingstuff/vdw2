Introduction: In Europe, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent varying between 40% to 60% in the healthy general adult population. The consequences of vitamin D deficiency for sepsis and outcome in critically ill patients remains controversial. We therefore systematically reviewed observational cohort studies on vitamin D deficiency on the intensive care unit.

Methods: Fourteen observational reports published from January 2000 to March 2014, retrieved from Pubmed and Embase, involving 9,715 critically ill patients and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25 (OH)-D) concentrations, were meta-analysed.

Results: Levels of 25 (OH)-D less than 50 nmol/L were associated with increased rates of infection (risk ratio (RR) 1.49, 95% (confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.99), P =0.007), sepsis (RR 1.46, 95% (CI 1.27 to 1.68), P <0.001), 30-day mortality (RR 1.42, 95% (CI 1.00 to 2.02), P =0.05), and in-hospital mortality (RR 1.79, 95% (CI 1.49 to 2.16), P <0.001). In a subgroup analysis of adjusted data including vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for 30 day-mortality the pooled RR was 1.76 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.26, P <0.001).

Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility for severe infections and mortality of the critically ill.

Abstract (provisional)

Introduction Vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients, and was reported to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, the effect of vitamin D deficiency on mortality in critically ill patients remains unclear.

Methods We searched PubMed and EMBASE from the inception to July 2014 for cohort studies to assess the effect of vitamin D deficiency on the incidence of mortality in critically ill patients. Mortality-specific odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled with a random- or fixed-effect models when appropriate.

Results Seven cohort studies with a total of 4,204 participants including 1,679 cases of vitamin D deficiency were included in this meta-analysis. 

Vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with an increased hospital  **mortality (OR 1.76** ; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.24; P <0.001), with very low heterogeneity (I 2?=?2.3%; P =0.402). 

The finding of increased hospital mortality in critically ill adult patients was consistently found in every stratum of our subgroup analyses.

Conclusions This meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased incidence of hospital mortality in critically ill adult patients.
