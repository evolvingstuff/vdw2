# Should the Concentration of Vitamin D be Measured in All Patients with Hypertension?

## Vitamin D and Hypertension

Epidemiologic association between Vitamin D deficiency and hypertension— Data from the INTERSALT study  **suggest a rise in BP is proportional to distance from the equator <sup>[12]</sup> while seasonal variations in BP have also been reported in temperate climates <sup>[13]</sup>.** 

Population studies have shown an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and hypertension, with increasing incidence of hypertension as Vitamin D levels decrease <sup>[6,14]</sup>. The largest database is from Forman and colleagues (6) using 117,730 subjects from the Health Professional follow-up study and the Nurse's Health Studies in which there was a median follow-up period of 4 years for the development of incident hypertension. When comparing those individuals whose 25-0H D levels were < 15 ng/ml versus those > 30 ng/ ml, the r **elative risk of developing hypertension was 3.18** , with a marked gender difference (6.13 in men and 2.67 in women). Hence, a significant inverse relationship exists between vitamin D and development of hypertension.

## Conclusions

With mounting evidence indicating the direct effect of vitamin D on the vascular smooth muscle cell, endothelial function and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, it is clear that randomized trials of vitamin D replacement and renin and angiotensin inhibition in patients with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency are warranted. Preliminary research has shown an inverse relationship between BP and vitamin D levels, and supplementation appears promising. To that end, we have just initiated a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effects of vitamin D and/or a renin inhibitor on ambulatory and clinic BP in vitamin D deficient patients with hypertension (clinical trials.gov identifier NCT00974922).

The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, particularly in northern latitudes and during the winter months, supports determining 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with hypertension and supplementation provided to those whose levels are < 30 ng/ ml. It is noteworthy that recommended 25-OH D levels of > 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L) are unlikely to be achieved with the previous recommendation of 200 IU for younger people and

600 IU of vitamin D for older adults <sup>[3]</sup>. 

Doses of vitamin D3 from 1000 to 2000 IU daily are often required <sup>[4,25]</sup>. For every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested, the levels in patients with vitamin D deficiency should increase by 1 ng/ml <sup>[4]</sup>. 

Therefore, to bring most of the adult population to levels of > 30 ng/ml, vitamin D supplementation of 1000 IU would be required in most, but even doses as high as  **4,000 I.U. are safe for short-term ‘loading’** , and would bring about 90% of the population to levels above 30 ng/ml within a few weeks.
