 **Highlights** 

* Question: Is vitamin D deficiency associated with depression in Nepalese population?

* Findings: vitamin D deficient individuals had  **3.5 times higher odds**  of developing clinically significant depression in comparison to those with sufficient vitamin D after adjusting for confounding variables.

* Meaning: Vitamin D deficient people are associated with increased likelihood of having clinically significant depression in Nepalese population.

Recent studies link vitamin D deficiency with depression; however evidences from the Nepalese population are scarce. The current study explored the association between vitamin D deficiency and depression among 300 adults of 18 years and above age residing in eastern Nepal. Validated Nepali version of the Beck Depression Inventory scale (BDI-Ia) was used to determine depressive symptoms and a BDI cutoff score of  **≥20**  was considered as clinically significant depression. Sociodemographic data were collected using semi-structured questionnaire. Blood samples were collected to measure serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) and classify vitamin D status (deficient, insufficient and sufficient). We used Chi-square test to identify the association of sociodemographic variables and vitamin D status with clinically significant depression. 

We found a significant association of gender, geographical location of residence, marital status, religion and vitamin D status with clinically significant depression. Binary logistic regression model was used to examine the likelihood of clinically significant depression among vitamin D deficient individuals. 

Vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with increased odds of clinically significant depression even after adjusting for confounding variables.

This finding suggests Vitamin D deficient people have increased odds of having clinically significant depression.
