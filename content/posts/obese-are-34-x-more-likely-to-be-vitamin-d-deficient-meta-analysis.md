Previous epidemiologic studies suggested that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor of obesity. However, the result is still controversial. This meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the association between vitamin D deficiency and obesity. We systematically searched Pubmed database, Chinese Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), for the literatures on the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and obesity published from 2010 to 2015. The effect sizes of overall odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using Stata 11.0. Heterogeneity was evaluated using random-effects model and forest plots. Fifteen studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, which included 3867 subjects with obesity and 9342 health subjects. Meta-analysis results showed that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was difference between obesity group and control group, and the pooled OR (95% CI) was  **3.43**  (2.33-5.06). 

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was associated with obesity in Asians and European-American, OR (95% CI) were 3.70 (1.98-6.90) and 3.09 (1.89-5.04), respectively. No publication bias was found in our study. vitamin D deficiency may be associated with obesity irrespective of areas.
