 **Guesses of Vitamin D response if poor gut** 

 **| | | | |

 **10= best bioavailable, 0 = worst,  guesses have a range of +-2** 

 **Speed:**  Fast ~2-6 hours, Slow ~10-30 hours

 **Duration:**  Long ~3-6 months, Normal = ~2 months

Reminder - Vitamin D is absorbed in the first portion of the small intestine
Some gut problems which only occur in large intestine may not be a problem
