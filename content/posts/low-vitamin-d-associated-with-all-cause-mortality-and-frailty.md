Background

Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels are common and may be associated with morbidity and mortality (and indeed with frailty more generally). This association is not restricted to the links between vitamin D and calcium and bone metabolism.

Objective

To review the influences of vitamin D on the aging process other than those related to bone and calcium. Its effect on mortality is also assessed.

Methods

The PubMed database was searched for English-language articles relating to vitamin D, using the following MeSH terms: vitamin D, mortality, cardiovascular diseases, and frailty. In addition, searches were carried out with Google.

Results

Although some of the reported results have proved controversial, overall the evidence seems to support an association between low serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels and mortality rates (all-cause and cardiovascular). Frailty is a condition frequently associated with low serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D levels.

Conclusion

 **The aging process and mortality are associated with low vitamin D levels** . Prospective controlled trials are warranted to determine whether vitamin D supplements can increase longevity and reduce the incidence of certain conditions.
