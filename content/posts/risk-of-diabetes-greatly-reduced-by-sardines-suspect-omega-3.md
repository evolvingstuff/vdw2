#### [Lower blood sugar with sardines](https://www.mdedge.com/internalmedicine/article/240083/lotme/canned-diabetes-prevention-and-haunted-covid-castle?channel=51718&ecd=wnl_lotpwr_210513_mdedge_12pm&uac=138704MX&utm_source=News_Power_eNL_051321_F&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Come%20for%20the%20torture,%20stay%20for%20the%20vaccine&sso=true) MDEdge ]

If you’ve ever turned your nose up at someone eating sardines straight from the can, you could be the one missing out on a good way to boost your own health.

New research from Open University of Catalonia (Spain) has found that eating two cans of whole sardines a week can help prevent people from developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Now you might be thinking: That’s a lot of fish, can’t I just take a supplement pill? Actually, no.

“Nutrients can play an essential role in the prevention and treatment of many different pathologies, but their effect is usually caused by the synergy that exists between them and the food that they are contained in,” study coauthor Diana Rizzolo, PhD, said in a [written statement](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/news/actualitat/2021/115-health-nutrition-diabetes-sardines.html). See, we told you.

In a study of 152 patients with prediabetes, each participant was put on a specific diet to reduce their chances of developing T2D. Among the patients who were not given sardines each week, the proportion considered to be at the highest risk fell from 27% to 22% after 1 year, but for those who did get the sardines, the size of the high-risk group shrank from 37% to just 8%.

Suggesting sardines during checkups could make eating them more widely accepted, Dr. Rizzolo and associates said. Sardines are cheap, easy to find, and also have the benefits of other oily fish, like boosting insulin resistance and increasing good cholesterol.

So why not have a can with a couple of saltine crackers for lunch? Your blood sugar will thank you. Just please avoid indulging on a plane or in your office, where workers are slowly returning – no need to give them another excuse to avoid their cubicle.
