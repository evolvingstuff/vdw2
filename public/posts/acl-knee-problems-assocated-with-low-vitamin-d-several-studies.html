Studies were selected based on speciﬁc inclusion criteria, such as studies evaluating the relationship between vitamin D and injury risk, ACLR outcomes and muscle strength. Risk of bias was assessed using the MINORS tool, and results were synthesized narratively due to study heterogeneity.</p><p>Results: Five studies with 656,243 participants met the inclusion criteria. Most studies reported that low vitamin D levels were associated with a signiﬁcantly increased risk of ACL injuries and poorer postoperative muscle strength recovery. However, evidence regarding bone health and functional outcomes was inconsistent. No meta‐analysis was conducted due to the variability of study designs and outcomes, but qualitative synthesis indicated a potential protective role of vitamin D in ACL recovery.</p><p>Conclusions: Vitamin D deﬁciency appears to increase the risk of ACL injury and impede muscle recovery post‐surgery.

Rates of primary ACL tears, primary reconstruction, and revision reconstruction were calculated for sex- and age-specific cohorts and compared to a control of patients without a diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Incidence rates for primary ACL injuries were calculated, and multivariable logistic regression was used to compare rates of ACL injury, primary reconstruction, and revision reconstruction while controlling for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and several other comorbidities.</p><p>Results: Among the 328,011 patients (mean age 41.9 ± 12.6 years, 65.8% female) included in both the hypovitaminosis D and control cohorts, the incidence of ACL tears was 115.2 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 107.2 - 123.7), compared to 61.0 (95% CI, 55.2 - 67.2) in the demographics and comorbidity matched control cohort.</p><p>The study cohort was significantly more likely to suffer an ACL tear over a</p><ul><li><p>one- (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI, 1.41 - 1.99, p &lt; 0.001) and</p></li><li><p><strong>two-year (aOR = 1.81</strong> , 95% CI, 1.59 - 2.06, p &lt; 0.001) period.</p></li></ul><p>This trend remained for both males at the one- (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI, 1.29 - 2.14, p &lt; 0.001) and two-year (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.37 - 2.06, p &lt; 0.001) mark and females at the one- (aOR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.33 - 2.14, p &lt; 0.001) and two-year (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI, 1.51 - 2.14, p &lt; 0.001) mark.

The inherent limitations of a retrospective protocol are discussed therein.1 It is noteworthy, however, to highlight a significant strength of the study that has been lacking in this overarching field of research. Specifically, <strong>Albright and colleagues1 assessed vitamin D status before trauma and related vitamin D status to ACL injury and revision surgery rates.</strong> This is significant because Albright and colleagues1 controlled for the potentially deleterious and confounding influence of trauma-induced inflammation on serum 25(OH)D concentrations2, 3, 4 by assessing vitamin D status before an ACL injury.</p><p>The systemic inflammatory response to an ACL injury (and surgery) is characterized by transient perturbations in diverse cytokines.5, 6, 7 In addition to regulating host defenses and cell signaling, cytokines moderate the enzymatic machinery of vitamin D metabolism in peripheral blood immune cells.2,8,9 Thus it is plausible that cytokine alterations in the circulation after an ACL injury contribute to the conversation of 25(OH)D to other vitamin D metabolites (e.g., 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).6 This, in turn, temporally compromises serum 25(OH)D concentrations and potentially confounds both the interpretation of vitamin D status4,10,11 and its subsequently inferred association with desired outcomes or variables.</p><p>The unique findings by Albright and colleagues1 also establish the basis for future vitamin D research in those at risk for an ACL injury and outcomes after an ACL injury and surgery. For example, taking into consideration the recent association of index ACL tears with low vitamin D1 and concomitant knee structure damage with an ACL injury,12 it is reasonable to presume that low serum 25(OH)D exacerbates knee structure damage (e.g., meniscus, cartilage, or both) with an ACL injury. Second, low vitamin D and ACL injuries are related to the progression in knee osteoarthritis and post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA), respectively.13,14 However, it is unknown whether low vitamin D contributes to the development and progression in PTOA after an ACL injury. Third, low vitamin D associates with muscular weakness after an ACL injury15 and with muscular atrophy and weakness in other conditions.16, 17, 18 Quadriceps atrophy and weakness are predominant impairments that continue to challenge the rehabilitative efforts after an ACL injury and surgery, and it is unknown if correcting hypovitaminosis D diminishes muscular impairments and improves outcomes after an ACL injury.</p><p>Albright and colleagues1 are commended for performing an outstanding study that extends our current knowledge. Future research assessing the impact of trauma induced alterations on serum 25(OH)D and determining whether correcting hypovitaminosis D improves outcomes after an ACL injury are warranted.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/low-d-then-acl-tear.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-related-in-vitamindwiki>See related in VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/acl-knee-surgery-increases-risk-of-subsequent-knee-osteoarthritis-by-up-to-2x-both-low-d>ACL Knee surgery increases risk of subsequent Knee Osteoarthritis by up to 2X (both low D) – Sept 2024</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/3x-less-muscle-atrophy-after-acl-surgery-if-more-than-40-ng-of-vitamin-d>3X less muscle atrophy after ACL surgery if more than 40 ng of vitamin D – May 2022</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/if-you-tear-a-knee-ligament-arthritis-is-likely-to-follow-in-10-years-both-are-r-o-low-vitamin-d>If You Tear a Knee Ligament, Arthritis Is Likely to Follow in 10 Years (both are related to low Vitamin D) – Nov 2017</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/rotator-cuff-tear-risk-increased-27-x-if-low-vitamin-d-diagnosis-in-previous-2-years>Rotator Cuff Tear risk increased 2.7 X if low vitamin D diagnosis in previous 2 years – Oct 2023</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/knee-surgery-reduced-vitamin-d-by-40-percent-in-2-days>Knee surgery reduced vitamin D by 40 percent in 2 days – May 2011</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=9200-studies-contain-acl-and-vitamin-d>9,200 Studies contain ACL and Vitamin D</h4><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=ACL&amp;as_epq=%22vitamin+d%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48">Google Scholar</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>Evidence for D</span>
