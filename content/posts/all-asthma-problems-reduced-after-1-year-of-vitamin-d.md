 **For those asthmatics who had < 20 ng initially  
Loading dose injection of 100,000 IU of vitamin D  
Weekly 5,000 IU of vitamin D  
Daily 400 IU of vitamin D & 1500 mg of Calcium** 

---

 **They would have had even more benefit if they had used high doses  
 - Initially 400,000 IU  
 - Weekly 50, 000 IU** 

 **Suspect that the injection form of the loading dose and the daily Calcium was not needed**
