A survey of 3,256 respondents, primarily residing in the United States, reveal improvements in a wide range of health symptoms following the removal or reduced consumption of genetically engineered foods, also called genetically modified organisms or GMOs. The changes are consistent with reports by physicians and others about improvements accompanying a switch to largely non-GMO and organic diets. 

The conditions that were most frequently reported as showing improvement include: 

* Digestive: 85.2%, 

* Fatigue, low energy: 60.4%, 

* Overweight or obesity: 54.6%, 

* Clouding of consciousness, 

* “brain fog”: 51.7%, 

* Food allergies or sensitivities: 50.2%, Mood problems, such as anxiety or depression: 51.1%, Memory, concentration: 48.1%, Joint pain: 47.5%, Seasonal allergies: 46.6%, Gluten sensitivities: 42.2%, Insomnia: 33.2%, Other skin conditions (not eczema): 30.9%, Hormonal problems: 30.4%, Musculoskeletal pain: 25.2%, Autoimmune disease: 21.4%, Eczema: 20.8%, and Cardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure: 19.8%.
