#### Metadichol®: A Novel Nanolipid Formulation That Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and a Multitude of Pathological Viruses In Vitro - Jan 2022

Biomed Res Int. 2022 Jan 15;2022:1558860. [doi: 10.1155/2022/1558860.](https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1558860.) eCollection 2022.

Palayakotai R Raghavan  1

Increasing outbreaks of new pathogenic viruses have promoted the exploration of novel alternatives to time-consuming vaccines. Thus, it is necessary to develop a universal approach to halt the spread of new and unknown viruses as they are discovered. One such promising approach is to target lipid membranes, which are common to all viruses and bacteria. The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of interactions between the virus envelope and the host cell plasma membrane as a critical mechanism of infection. Metadichol®, a nanolipid emulsion of long-chain alcohols, has been demonstrated as a strong candidate that inhibits the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Naturally derived substances, such as long-chain saturated lipid alcohols, reduce viral infectivity, including that of coronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV-2) by modifying their lipid-dependent attachment mechanism to human host cells. The receptor ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells, whereas the serine protease TMPRSS2 primes the viral S protein. In this study, Metadichol® was found to be 270 times more potent an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 (EC50 = 96 ng/mL) than camostat mesylate (EC50 = 26000 ng/mL). Additionally, it inhibits ACE with an EC50 of 71 ng/mL, but it is a very weak inhibitor of ACE2 at an EC50 of 31 μg/mL. Furthermore, the live viral assay performed in Caco-2 cells revealed that Metadichol® inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication at an EC90 of 0.16 μg/mL. Moreover, Metadichol® had an EC90 of 0.00037 μM, making it 2081 and 3371 times more potent than remdesivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM) and chloroquine (EC50 = 1.14 μM), respectively.

#### A Review of the Effects of Policosanol on Metabolic Syndrome - Sept 2022

Clinical Complementary Medicine & Pharmacology Vol 2, Issue 3, Sept 2022, 100058 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccmp.2022.100058

Abdulgafar O.JimohaUmar MuhammadTukuraMustapha UmarImamb

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the world's number one killer disease and the leading non-communicable disease in terms of causing premature deaths. Overwhelming evidence suggest that effective management of metabolic syndrome will markedly reduce morbidity and premature deaths from cardiovascular disease. Although many therapies exist, most of them are ineffective due to decreased effectiveness and/or side effects following prolonged usage. Policosanol, a well-tolerated long-chain aliphatic alcohol has been proven to be effective against the components of metabolic syndrome (namely dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity) even when used for a long period with minimal or no adverse effects.

Objective

This study intends to explore the potential benefits of Policosanol in the management of metabolic syndrome.

Methods

PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct were used as the search engines to retrieve articles related to Policosanol and metabolic syndrome from 2010 to 2021.

Results

The results from the three search engines were scrutinized and merged. Duplicate publications were excluded. Similarly, four articles from the WHO website (www.who.int/publications) were included making a total of 63 articles used in this review. Most of the reviewed articles show Policosanol to be effective in rreducing

* systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 

* blood glucose level, 

* body weight,

* total cholesterol level,

* triglyceride level, 

* low density lipoprotein and increasing high density lipoprotein levels. 

There are few conflicting articles that reported Policosanol to have no effect on lipid parameters.

Conclusion

Policosanol was shown to be a safe and well-tolerated natural product that is effective against all the components of metabolic syndrome. Thus, using this natural product will go a long way in reducing the burden and economic consequences of the syndrome.

#### Ageing process and policosanol effects - Oct 2021

World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2021, 12(02), 273–283.  DOI: 10.30574/wjarr.2021.12.2.0242

José Illnait-Ferrer, Julio César Fernández-Travieso *, Yenney Reyes-Nuñez and Alicia de la Caridad Duquesne-Chávez

Clinical Trials Unit, National Centre for Scientific Research, Havana, Cuba.

The fundamental concepts of the aging process are exposed: Its dimension as a health problem, aspects related to its repercussion from the social point of view, and Its influence on aspects that can affect the normal development of contemporary society. The roles of genetics, cellular and biochemical processes that concur in the development of aging is analyzed, making special reference to the role of Adenosine Mono Phosphate Kinase <span>[AMPK]</span>. activation in the regulation of the aging process and the participation of mechanisms for its activation. 

It is concluded that Policosanol is a medicament of natural origin that could be proposed as candidate to be used for a healthy aging, based on the results of various investigations in experimental models and data obtained from different clinical trials.

#### Metadichol: A novel vitamin D receptor inverse/protean agonist and a vitamin D substitute - Sept 2017

International Conference on VITAMINS, NUTRIGENOMICS & MALNUTRITION

September 15-16, 2017 | Dallas, USA

P R Raghavan, Nanorx INC, USA

Metadichol (US patent 8,722,093 and 9043,383) is a nanoemulsion of long-chain alcohols found in many foods that are present in foods such as rice, sugar cane, wheat, peanuts. Metadichol acts as inverse/Protean agonist on Nuclear Vitamin D receptors (VDR) (US patent 9,006,292) that are present in cells throughout the body to stimulate the immune system. Metadichol® is first of a class of novel nano-emulsion molecules which are a safe and effective inhibitors of various biomarkers that affect many human diseases especially in the area of endocrine disorders. Here, in addition to acting on VDR, it shows cross reactivity against other nuclear receptors and how this leads to mitigation of infections including gene expression analysis and human clinical case studies will be presented. Because it consists of natural components of conventional foods and has no known adverse side effects. Metadichol has the potential to serve as a novel, vitamin D substitute for the widespread deficiency that exists worldwide and overcome many chronic diseases.

#### Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoporosis: A Case Study - May 2017

J Arthritis 2017, 6:3 DOI: 10.4172/2167-7921.1000240

PR Raghavan

Metadichol® is a Nano emulsion of long-chain alcohols called as Policosanol and is present in foods such as rice, sugar cane, wheat, and peanuts. Metadichol® acts on Nuclear  **Vitamin D receptors (VDR)**  that are present in cells throughout the body to stimulate the immune system and inhibit a variety of disease processes, resulting from inflammation to infection <sup>[1]</sup>.

We present a case study of a patient with Rheumatoid arthritis with the high levels of RF antibodies, CRP and ESR levels, and low bone mineral density leading to osteoporosis. The case report shows how Metadichol® by its actions on the VDR has affected key biomarkers and mitigated the disease conditions without any side effects. Also, his bone density improved dramatically.

Metadichol® is safe because it consists of natural components of conventional foods and has no known adverse side effects. Its constituents are present in many foods that we consume every day.

Metadichol® has the potential to serve as a novel, safe solution to help patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases that confront the world today.
