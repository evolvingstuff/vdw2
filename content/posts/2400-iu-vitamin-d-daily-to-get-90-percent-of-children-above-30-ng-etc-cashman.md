Background

This work was commissioned by the WHO and FAO to inform their update of the vitamin D requirements for children below 4 years old.

Objective

The objective of this work was to undertake multi-level and multivariable dose-response modelling of serum 25OHD to total vitamin D intake in children below 4 years of age and to derive updated vitamin D requirements for young children.

Methods

Systematically identified randomized controlled trials among healthy children from 2 weeks up to 3.9 years of age provided with daily vitamin D supplements or vitamin D-fortified foods were included. Linear and non-linear random effects multi-level meta-regression models with and without covariates were fitted and compared. Inter-individual variability was included by simulating the individual serum 25OHD responses. The percentage of individuals reaching set minimal and maximal serum 25OHD thresholds were calculated and used to derive vitamin D requirements.

Results

A total of 31 trials with 186 data points, from North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia/Oceania, with latitudes ranging from 38°S to 61°N, and with participants of likely mostly light or medium skin pigmentation, were included; in 29 studies the children received vitamin D supplements and in two studies the children received vitamin D fortified milks with or without supplements. The dose-response relationship between vitamin D intake and serum 25OHD was best fitted with the unadjusted quadratic model; adding additional covariates, such as age, did not significantly improve the model. At a vitamin D intake of 10 μg/d, 97.3% of the individuals were predicted to achieve a minimal serum 25OHD threshold of 28 nmol/L. At a vitamin D intake of 35 μg/d, 1.4% of the individuals predicted to reach a maximal serum 25OHD threshold of 200 nmol/L.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this paper details the methodological steps taken to derive vitamin D requirements in children below 4 years of age, including the addition of an inter-individual variability component.

!!!!The relationship between vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in young children: a meta-regression to inform WHO/FAO vitamin D intake recommendations

Background
This work was commissioned by the WHO and FAO to inform their update of the vitamin D requirements for children below 4 years old.

Objective
The objective of this work was to undertake multi-level and multivariable dose-response modelling of serum 25OHD to total vitamin D intake in children below 4 years of age and to derive updated vitamin D requirements for young children.

Methods
Systematically identified randomized controlled trials among healthy children from 2 weeks up to 3.9 years of age provided with daily vitamin D supplements or vitamin D-fortified foods were included. Linear and non-linear random effects multi-level meta-regression models with and without covariates were fitted and compared. Inter-individual variability was included by simulating the individual serum 25OHD responses. The percentage of individuals reaching set minimal and maximal serum 25OHD thresholds were calculated and used to derive vitamin D requirements.

Results
A total of 31 trials with 186 data points, from North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia/Oceania, with latitudes ranging from 38°S to 61°N, and with participants of likely mostly light or medium skin pigmentation, were included; in 29 studies the children received vitamin D supplements and in two studies the children received vitamin D fortified milks with or without supplements. The dose-response relationship between vitamin D intake and serum 25OHD was best fitted with the unadjusted quadratic model; adding additional covariates, such as age, did not significantly improve the model. At a vitamin D intake of 10 μg/d, 97.3% of the individuals were predicted to achieve a minimal serum 25OHD threshold of 28 nmol/L. At a vitamin D intake of 35 μg/d, 1.4% of the individuals predicted to reach a maximal serum 25OHD threshold of 200 nmol/L.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this paper details the methodological steps taken to derive vitamin D requirements in children below 4 years of age, including the addition of an inter-individual variability component.
