 **Notes on evolutionary history of Vitamin D by VitaminDWiki after reading the Jan 2016 PDF** 

550 million years ago Vitamin D involved in mineralization of snails etc,

450 million years ago Vitamin D Receptor and Vitamin D Binding Protein

Has a nice chart of Vitamin D-related features vs 100's millions of years

Vast majority of the article deals with the structure of Vitamin D and that of the Vitamin D Receptor
