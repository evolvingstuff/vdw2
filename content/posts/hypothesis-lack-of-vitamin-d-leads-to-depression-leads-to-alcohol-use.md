"Still, one exception would be Australian Aborigines who get all the sunshine anybody could want and have terrible alcoholism problems."

"This suggests that the main issue is number of generations with experience with alcohol. The longer ago your ancestor started drinking, the more time for natural selection to weed out the ones who can't handle their alcohol. Thus, Ashkenazi Jews from the cloudy Poland have lower alcoholism rates than gentile Poles."
