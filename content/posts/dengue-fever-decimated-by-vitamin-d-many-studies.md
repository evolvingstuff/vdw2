#### Dengue appears to be prevented and treated by Vitamin D - systematic review Jan 2025

 **Investigating the Role of Vitamin D in the Prevention and Control of Dengue Virus Vectors and Related Diseases: A Systematic Review Study** 

Preprint  https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.07.25320153

Introduction: Dengue fever is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in the world, affecting many people annually and causing many deaths. Besides, treating this disease is difficult, and there is no effective vaccine for it. In recent years, attention has been paid to the role of micronutrients, including vitamin D, in the control and treatment of viral diseases, including dengue fever. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D in the treatment and control of dengue fever worldwide using a systematic review method. 

Methods: This study was conducted as a systematic review of the role of vitamin D in the prevention and control of dengue fever globally using a systematic review method. Therefore, all relevant articles were extracted and reviewed through a search in the international scientific databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, WEB OF Science (ISI), and SCOPUS, without a time limit until the end of 2024. The quality of the articles was assessed using the STROB checklist. 

Results: Six articles published between 2018 and 2023 were included in the systematic review process. According to the findings, vitamin D affects macrophages that are differentiated from monocytes and increases resistance to dengue virus. Vitamin D also reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, transcription, and reduction of mRNA receptors, increases the production of interleukins, especially IL-10, and plays a role in reducing viral load, severity of clinical symptoms, and infection control. 

Conclusion: Vitamin D3 can control the disease and decrease viral load and the severity of dengue fever in patients by inhibiting the inflammatory response and enhancing the immune response. However, given the limited number of studies, it is recommended that more studies be conducted in this field so that this can be discussed with more evidence and accuracy.

 **Strangely: vitamin D resulted in more Dengue** 

Background: To compare the risk and severity of development of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome(DSS) in patients receiving Vitamin D supplement compared to those not receiving it.

Methods: Diagnosed patients of DF (n=124) were enrolled in this comparative study. Patients were randomized into two groups having 62 participants in each group. Group A received  **single dose of 200,000 IU Vitamin D**  and Group B received no intervention. Both groups were followed for development of DHF or DSS. Chi square was applied to compare the groups.

Results: One patient (1.6%) in Group A developed DHF. Seventeen (27%) patients in Group B progressed to DHF. The relationship between Vitamin D and progression to DHF was significant, X2 (2, N=170) =16.43, p= 0.000). The calculated relative risk was 0.0588 (95% confidence interval, .0081 to .4285; p for trend = 0.0588).

Conclusion: Vitamin D decreases the risk of DHF and may have a role in management of dengue fever.

 **Vitamin D Deficiency (VDD) and Susceptibility towards Severe Dengue Fever-A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study of Hospitalized Dengue Fever Patients from Lahore, Pakistan** 

Trop Med Infect Dis . 2023 Jan 5;8(1):43. [doi: 10.3390/tropicalmed8010043.](https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed8010043.)

Dengue is a mosquito-borne flaviviral serious febrile illness, most common in the tropical and subtropical regions including Pakistan. Vitamin D is a strong immunomodulator affecting both the innate and adaptive immune responses and plays a pivotal role in pathogen-defense mechanisms. There has been considerable interest in the possible role of vitamin D in dengue viral (DENV) infection. In the present prospective cross-sectional study, we assessed a possible association between serum vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and susceptibility towards severe dengue fever (DF) illness. Serum vitamin D levels were measured at the time of hospitalization in 97 patients diagnosed with dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) at Mayo Hospital, King Edward Medical University, Lahore, PK, from 16 November 2021 to 15 January 2022. In terms of disease severity, 37 (38.1%) patients were DF, 52 (53.6%) were DHF grade 1 and 2, and 8 (8.2%) were DSS. The results revealed that most patients (75 (77.3%)) were vitamin-D-deficient (i.e., serum level &lt; 20 ng/mL), including 27 (73.0%) in DF, 41 (78.8%) in DHF grade 1 and 2, and 7 (87.5%) in DSS. The degree of VDD was somewhat higher in DSS patients as compared to DF and DHF grade 1 and 2 patients. Overall, serum vitamin D levels ranged from 4.2 to 109.7 ng/mL, and the median (IQR) was in the VDD range, i.e., 12.2 (9.1, 17.8) ng/mL. Our results suggest that there may be a possible association between VDD and susceptibility towards severe dengue illness. Hence, maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels in the body either through diet or supplementation may help provide adequate immune protection against severe dengue fever illness. Further research is warranted

##### Review of micronutrients and Dengue - including the above RCT

 **Micronutrient Supplementation and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Dengue Fever** 

Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2021 Jan; 104(1): 45–51  2020 Nov  [doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.20-0731](https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0731)

Steven D. Langerman and Mija Ververs*

 **Abtract**  Dengue fever (DF) is a viral infection that is common in tropical countries and represents a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence and severity, treatment options for DF remain limited and consist primarily of supportive measures. Several recent studies have concluded that micronutrient supplementation may improve clinical outcomes in patients with DF, but no review has summarized and synthesized these findings. We conducted a literature review to identify articles investigating the effect of micronutrient supplementation on clinical outcomes among patients with DF. 

We found several studies which indicated that supplemental 

* vitamin C, 

*  **vitamin D,** 

* vitamin E, and 

* zinc 

may be useful adjuncts in DF treatment. Folic acid supplementation did not appear to affect clinical outcomes. The reviewed studies have significant limitations including small sample sizes and limited data about the baseline nutritional status of study subjects. We identify a need for additional high-quality randomized trials to elucidate the role of micronutrient supplementation in DF treatment.

 **Clipped from PDF** 

Vitamin D.

Zaman et al.23 conducted an RCT of 124 patients suffering from DF at an academic medical center in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The mean age of the study subjects was 33 years, but baseline data were not provided separately for the intervention and control groups. Patients were randomized either to receive a single dose of 200,000 international units of vitamin D (n = 62) in addition to standard care, or to receive standard care only (n = 62). Both groups were followed for development of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. 

* Among patients who received the vitamin D supplement, only one patient (1.6%) developed dengue hemorrhagic fever. 

* In the group that did not receive the supplement, 17 patients (27%) developed dengue hemorrhagic fever. 

Those not receiving vitamin D were more likely to develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (χ2 = 16.43, P = 0.00). The relative risk of progressing to dengue hemorrhagic fever in patients who received vitamin D compared with those who did not receive vitamin D was 0.0588 (95% CI: 0.0081, 0.4285). However, this study did not assess whether patients were vitamin D deficient at baseline, and did not contain any information about the patients’ diets.

Dengue, caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection, is a public health problem worldwide. Although DENV pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated, the inflammatory response is a hallmark feature in severe DENV infection. Although vitamin D (vitD) can promote the innate immune response against virus infection, no studies have evaluated the effects of vitD on DENV infection, dendritic cells (DCs), and inflammatory response regulation. This study aimed to assess the impact of oral vitD supplementation on DENV-2 infection, Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, and both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production in monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). To accomplish this, 20 healthy donors were randomly divided into two groups and received either 1000 or 4000 international units (IU)/day of vitD for 10 days. During pre- and post-vitD supplementation, peripheral blood samples were taken to obtain MDDCs, which were challenged with DENV-2. We found that MDDCs from donors who received 4000 IU/day of vitD were less susceptible to DENV-2 infection than MDDCs from donors who received 1000 IU/day of vitD. Moreover, these cells showed decreased mRNA expression of TLR3, 7, and 9; downregulation of IL-12/IL-8 production; and increased IL-10 secretion in response to DENV-2 infection. In conclusion, the administration of 4000 IU/day of vitD decreased DENV-2 infection. Our findings support a possible role of vitD in improving the innate immune response against DENV. However, further studies are necessary to determine the role of vitD on DENV replication and its innate immune response modulation in MDDCs.

#### Poor VDR 1.24X more-likely if severe Dengue - Dec 2020

 **Association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism with disease severity among dengue patients** 

International Journal of infectious Diseases https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.1297

A. Chakravarti. T. Bharara, N. Kapoor

Background: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is coded by VDR gene located on chromosome 12. The present study was undertaken to decipher the effect of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism on dengue disease outcome, as there is a dearth of similar studies in the context of Indian population.

Methods and materials: The study was conducted in the Virology Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. We studied 100 cases (suspected dengue patients) and 100 healthy controls over a period of 1 year (January 2014 to December 2014). Revised WHO guidelines (2009) were followed to define and characterize a case of dengue. Peripheral venous samples were collected for diagnosis of dengue (NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibody). Genomic DNA was extracted from patients and healthy controls and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism was done for detection of VDRL gene polymorphism (start codon rs2228570 and 3′ UTR, rs7975232). Data was analysed using SPSS software (version 17.0). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results: VDR gene polymorphism (rs 2228570 and rs 7975232) was screened in the samples. Genotype C/C, C/T and T/T (rs 2228570) was found in 11 (25.58%), 18 (41.9%) and 14 (32.6%) dengue positive cases and 59%, 25% and 16% healthy controls respectively (p = 0.001, significant). Significant association of the T allele of rs 2228570 polymorphism in a dominant mode of inheritance (C/T + T/T genotype) was seen with severe dengue cases [OR of 3.86 (1.59–9.35), p = 0.002 for C/T and 4.69 (1.79–12.3), p = 0.001 for T/T genotypes](OR%20of%203.86%20(1.59–9.35),%20p = 0.002%20for%20C/T%20and%204.69%20(1.79–12.3),%20p = 0.001%20for%20T/T%20genotypes). 

Genotypes A/A, A/C and C/C (rs 7975232) were found in 

* 34.9%, 55.8%, 9.3% dengue positive cases and 

* 31%, 40%, 29% healthy controls respectively. 

While comparing the A/A with A/C and C/C genotypes among dengue cases and healthy controls, the OR was estimated to be 1.24 (0.55–2.75, p > 0.05) and 0.28 (0.08–0.96, p < 0.05) respectively. This suggested that C/C genotype of rs7975232 was associated with reduced risk of developing symptomatic dengue (p = 0.035).

Conclusion: A significant association of T allele of rs 2228570 polymorphism was found in severe dengue cases in the study. The results also suggest that C/C genotype of rs 7975232 was associated with reduced risk of developing symptomatic dengue.

#### Increased Vitamin D receptor activation reduced Dengue cells 2X to 3X - July 2020

 **Activity of vitamin D receptor agonists against dengue virus** 

Scientific Reports volume 10, Article number: 10835 (2020)

Janejira Jaratsittisin, Bin Xu, Wannapa Sornjai, Zhibing Weng, Atichat Kuadkitkan, Feng Li, Guo-Chun Zhou & Duncan R. Smith 

Infections with the mosquito-transmitted dengue virus (DENV) are a pressing public health problem in many parts of the world. The recently released commercial vaccine for DENV has encountered some problems, and there is still no effective drug to treat infections. Vitamin D has a well characterized role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, but additionally has a role in the immune response to bacterial and viral pathogens. In this study a number of fused bicyclic derivatives of 1H-pyrrolo<sup>[1,2]</sup>imidazol-1-one with vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist activity were evaluated for possible anti-DENV activity. The results showed that five of the compounds were able to significantly inhibit DENV infection. The most effective compound, ZD-3, had an EC50 value of 7.47 μM and a selective index of 52.75. The compounds were only effective when used as a post-infection treatment and treatment significantly reduced levels of infection, virus output, DENV protein expression and genome copy number. These results suggest that these VDR agonists have the potential for future development as effective anti-DENV agents.
