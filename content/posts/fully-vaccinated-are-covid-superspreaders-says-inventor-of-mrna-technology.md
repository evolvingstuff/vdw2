 **Do not know if vaccinated are superspreaders, but it is a possibility.  
 - - - VACCINATED - - -   
1) Are 100X more infectious when infected  
2) Are infectious for [4X longer time](/posts/long-haul-vaers-ivermectin-vaccines-etc-drs-seheult-patrick-video-with-table-of-contents)  
3) Tend to no longer wear masks, so spread the infection more than unvaccinated  
4) Have more access to public places - resturants, airplanes, international travel, etc**

 **[The number of COVID-19 cases are almost independent of the amount of vaccination](/posts/covid-19-cases-vs-vaccination-counties-and-countries)  
Vertical axis = COVID-19 cases  
Horizontal axis = vaccination of US counties - from <span style="color:#F00;"><5% to >70%</span>**
