* Earlier rat studies showed Magnesium L-Threonate getting to rat brains

* Human studies have found that Magnesium L-Threonate brain bioavailability if only 15% more than other Magnesium compounds

Life Extension Foundation is one of 67 supplier of Magnesium L-Threonate 

$1/daily for 120 mg = 83 cents/ 100 milligrams of Mg

Mg Cl from Good State  9600 mg for $19 = 20 cents per 100 milligrams of Mg

 **L-Threonate is 4X more expensive for 15% more benefit** 

I make my own MgCl from crystals purchased on Amazon

2 lbs  of MgCl crystals for $21: 12% is Mg element

So about 50 doses of 100 mg for $1 = $0.02 per 100 mg

 **= 40 times lower cost from Crystals than Mg from Magnesium L-Threonate**

but reading the study finds that the huge brain improvements were compared to a placebo

The placebo contained ZERO Magnesium

 **Note also : MgChloride is probably more available to seniors since it increases stomach acidity**

### Email comment on Magnesium L’threonate by Carolyn Dean MD ND: <span>[www.drcarolyndean.com]</span>

Every week I’m asked about this new Magnesium L’threonate product, Magtein. Threonate is a sugar acid bound to magnesium. The January 28, 2010 issue of Neuron published a paper titled, “Enhancement of Learning and Memory by Elevating Brain Magnesium.” The study was done on rats and researchers said that “Our findings suggest that an increase in brain magnesium enhances both short-term synaptic facilitation and long-term potentiation and improves learning and memory functions.” The study compares several different forms of magnesium for absorption into the cerebrospinal fluid and found that Magtein measured  **only 7 percent**  higher at day 24 of intake. They admit that threonate by itself does not have “any positive effect on memory.”

With this 7 percent increase in the CSF, promoters of Magtein say t **heirs is the only magnesium that crosses the blood brain barrier. That is an inaccurate statement.**  Giving superpowers to their product obscures the reality that any magnesium could produce some or all of these same effects. The treatment of migraines, seizures, stroke, head injuries and other nervous system problems with even the highly unabsorbed magnesium oxide (at 4%) shows that all magnesium works at the neuron level, which means all or part of it gets into the brain. See the 24 chapters in [Magnesium in the Central Nervous System ](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/magnesium/magnesium-ebook.pdf)for more evidence.

 **Personally, when I take Magtein, I get the laxative effect** , which means to me that it’s not fully absorbed at the cellular level like some other forms of magnesium. In one formulation, three capsules of Magtein gives you 144mg of magnesium. I would have to take about 20 capsules a day to meet my magnesium requirements. And I wouldn’t get the therapeutic effect before developing diarrhea. From a quick google search, Magtein is a patented product, so this animal study is being used to promote the product. Therefore every opportunity is used to say it’s better than the competition making people feel that if they don’t take this one, they are not getting any benefit from the others. In August 2013, I heard from a supplier of magtein that  **“There has been a vendor price increase, up to 400% for magnesium threonate.”** The research must be paid for, so create the demand and then raise the price is a standard marketing practice.

When you read the free eBook, Magnesium in the CNS it will convince you that all magnesiums (to some extent, cross the BBB and can have a positive effect on the brain. https://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/magnesium/ However, I do find ReMag is the best absorbed allowing a therapeutic effect before the laxative effect.
