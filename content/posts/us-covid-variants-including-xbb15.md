 **[Health Experts Warily Eye XBB.1.5, the Latest Omicron Subvariant](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/07/science/covid-omicron-variants-xbb.html) NYT Jan 7, 2023** 

XBB is a recombination of two previous variants

XBB ". . . got a winning ticket in the genetic lottery. From one parent, it gained a set of mutations that helped it evade antibodies from previous infections and vaccinations. From the other parent, it gained a separate set of mutations that made it even more evasive."

#### Note: Vitamin D allows the body to fight all previous variants of human Corona Viruses  
suspect it will allow the body to fight XBB... as well

#### W.H.O. calls XBB.1.5 the most resistant variant yet - Jan 11, 2023

The World Health Organization on Wednesday released its XBB.1.5 [risk assessment report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/11jan2023_xbb15_rapid_risk_assessment.pdf), saying the omicron offshoot is among the “most antibody-resistant variants to date.” Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s COVID-19 technical lead said [during a briefing](https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1YpKkgovLooKj) that the lineage is one of more than 500 coronavirus subvariants that the WHO is currently tracking worldwide but notable for its rapid increase in proportion in the U.S. and “growth advantage compared to other sublineages of omicron.” The U.N. health agency said it is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine if XBB.1.5 is deadlier than previous strains or if it is “associated with potential changes in severity.”
