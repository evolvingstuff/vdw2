#### Heavily Vaxxed Japan’s SARS-CoV-2 Surge Turns Deadly - July 25, 2022

 **Hospitalizations Accelerate & Death Toll Now Growing** 

 **[TrialSitenews](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/heavily-vaxxed-japans-sars-cov-2-surge-turns-deadly-hospitalizations-accelerate-death-toll-now-growing-1f735571)** 

* "By Sunday, July 24th the 7-day new daily infection average surged to 150,559 cases. More disturbing is the growth in daily hospitalizations. On July 19, TrialSite reported on the last date with figures—July 13 with 11,679 persons in the hospital in Japan due to COVID-19. The ICU number on that day was 747. What’s unfolded during the last six days? The hospitalization figure has climbed to 18,010, with 1,031 Japanese now in the ICU."

#### Majority of COVID-19 Deaths Among Australia NSW Residents Triple & Quadruple Vaxxed- July 1, 2022

 **[TrialSiteNews](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/majority-of-covid-19-deaths-among-australia-nsw-residents-triple-quadruple-vaxxed-66b6eefc) June 28 &nbsp; [<span style="color:#F00;">TSN Video July 1, 2022</span>](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/majority-of-covid-19-deaths-among-australia-nsw-residents-are-triple-quadruple-vaccinated-video-8cffc07e)** 

 **Mainly Omicron BA.4 and BA.5**

TrialSite suggests a confluence of factors interact to heighten risk of hospitalization and death including 

* 1) COVID-19 vaccine durability challenges (waning effectiveness against mutating pathogens); 

* 2) mutating variants and subvariants that vaccine manufacturers face challenges keeping up with; 

* 3) the overall surge in new cases due to a combination of highly transmissible variants/sub-variants and less natural immunity generally present; 

* 4) Australia’s rigid zero-tolerance COVID policy during the pandemic. 

All these combined equal heightened risk for the elderly and immunocompromised.”

The data for the week ending June 18th reveals that  **94.8% of NSW**  residents that passed away due to COVID-19 were vaccinated.

#### Possible reasons: Each jab 1) reduces natural immunity or 2) reduces Vitamin D level

#### Infection rates double in those who had been boosted

 **Primary 1-2 jabs,  56.44 per 100,000, add 1 or 2 boosters: 119.94 per 100,000** 

 **Why Three COVID Jabs Are Worse Than Two - Mercola July 1, 2022 &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/covid-vaccine-three-doses-pdf.pdf">PDF</a>** 

 **Also: Child Trials** 

* "Another crucial piece of information that Craig highlights in her video is that of the 4,526 children enrolled in the trial, a whopping **3,000 dropped out** . Pfizer does not explain this highly suspicious anomaly. Oftentimes, trial participants will drop out when side effects are too severe for them to continue."

* "Six of the children, aged 2 to 4 years, in the vaccinated group were diagnosed with “severe COVID,” compared to just one in the placebo group. So, the likelihood the shot is causing severe COVID is higher than the likelihood that it’s preventing it."

* "In the end, they only counted  **three cases of COVID in the vaccine arm**  and  **seven cases in the placebo group** . They literally  **ignored 97% of all the COVID cases that occurred during the tria** l to conclude that the shots were “effective” in preventing COVID."
