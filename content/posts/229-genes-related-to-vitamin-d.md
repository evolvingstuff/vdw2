### From the PDF: Significance analysis of genomic overlap

In order to assess if there is a significant overlap between two sets of genomic features we followed the procedure described in Gentleman et al. (2004). In brief, the percentage base overlap between a query set of genomic intervals is tested against a reference set of genomic intervals and the overlap is recorded. The expected overlap is then computed by randomizing the locations of the query set of intervals. The procedure accounts for compositional biases by requiring that the randomized location of a segment remains on the same chromosome and preserves the local G+C content. From 10,000 randomizations the procedure computes the expected overlap and an empirical P-value. The reported fold enrichment is the ratio of the observed overlap and the expected overlap. By aggregating the randomizations from multiple reference sets, an empirical FDR is computed. Only results with an FDR of <1% are reported. For analysis of enrichment of VDR binding sites in relation to DNase I hypersensitivity, CTCF binding, and histone modifications, ENCODE data generated for the unstimulated lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 were used. We tested disease and selection intervals from data available at www.t1dbase.org, the NHGRI GWAS database (http://www.genome.gov/26525384), and data from (Voight et al. 2006; Barrett et al. 2008; De Jager et al. 2009; Gandhi et al. 2010) (interval defined as 150 kb on either side of main disease-associated SNP, or 100 kb on either side of a gene shown to be differentially expressed) for

## Press Release: Vitamin D linked to autoimmune and cancer disease genes, underscoring risks of deficiency

August 24, 2010 – Vitamin D insufficiency is a risk factor for a number of diseases and thus, is a growing concern worldwide, as approximately one billion people may be vitamin D deficient. However, the biological basis for vitamin D deficiency predisposing to disease is poorly understood. In a report published online today in Genome Research (www.genome.org), scientists have mapped the molecular interactions of the vitamin D receptor genome-wide, finding novel connections of vitamin D with genes related to autoimmune disease and cancer.

Vitamin D deficiency, resulting from either lack of sun exposure or poor dietary intake, is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for a number of serious illnesses, and has been linked with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. Yet exactly how vitamin D is involved in disease is largely unknown. Researchers suspect that genetics could be contributing to the connection.

Vitamin D exerts its effects on genes through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which binds to specific locations of the genome to influence gene expression. An international team of researchers from the United Kingdom and Canada have now mapped sites of VDR binding, information they can then use to identify disease-related genes that vitamin D might influence.

Employing a technique called ChIP-seq, Dr. Sreeram Ramagopalan, of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at Oxford University, and colleagues isolated fragments of genomic DNA bound to the VDR before and after treatment of cells with calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, and then sequenced the DNA fragments. By mapping the sequences back to the genome, they identified more than 2,700 sites of VDR binding, a number that Ramagopalan noted "shows just how important vitamin D is to humans, and the wide variety of biological pathways that vitamin D plays a role in."

In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered numerous genomic regions harboring genetic variants that confer increased risk to disease. To identify potential genetic links between vitamin D and disease, the group analyzed known disease-associated regions of the genome looking for enrichment of VDR binding in these intervals.

They found that VDR binding is significantly enriched in genomic regions associated with several common autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn's disease. Importantly, the analysis revealed a novel role for vitamin D at several disease genes, information that will be crucial for future investigations. VDR binding was also enriched in regions associated with cancers such as leukemia and colorectal cancer, and even common traits such as tanning, height, and hair color.

Ramagopalan explained that their findings lend significant support to the hypothesis that vitamin D interacts with genes in the pathogenesis of these diseases, and underscores the serious risks of vitamin D deficiency, especially for individuals who may be genetically predisposed to be sensitive to insufficiency. "Considerations of vitamin D supplementation as a preventative measure for these diseases are strongly warranted," Ramagopalan added.

## Vitamin D found to influence over 200 genes, highlighting links to disease -PhysOrg -  August 23, 2010

http://www.physorg.com/news201791554.html 

The extent to which vitamin D deficiency may increase susceptibility to a wide range of diseases is dramatically highlighted in research published today. Scientists have mapped the points at which vitamin D interacts with our DNA - and identified over two hundred genes that it directly influences. The results are published today in the journal Genome Research.

It is estimated that one billion people worldwide do not have sufficient vitamin D. This deficiency is thought to be largely due to insufficient exposure to the sun and in some cases to poor diet. As well as being a well-known risk factor for rickets, there is a growing body of evidence that vitamin D deficiency also increases an individual's susceptibility to autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, as well as certain cancers and even dementia.

Now, in a study whose funders include the Medical Research Council (MRC), the MS Society, the Wellcome Trust and the MS Society of Canada, researchers at the University of Oxford have shown the extent to which vitamin D interacts with our DNA. They used new DNA sequencing technology to create a map of vitamin D receptor binding across the genome. The vitamin D receptor is a protein activated by vitamin D, which attaches itself to DNA and thus influences what proteins are made from our genetic code.

The researchers found 2,776 binding sites for the vitamin D receptor along the length of the genome. These were unusually concentrated near a number of genes associated with susceptibility to autoimmune conditions such as MS, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (or 'lupus') and rheumatoid arthritis, and to cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and colorectal cancer.

They also showed that vitamin D had a significant effect on the activity of 229 genes including IRF8, previously associated with MS, and PTPN2, associated with Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes.

"Our study shows quite dramatically the wide-ranging influence that vitamin D exerts over our health," says Dr Andreas Heger from the MRC Functional Genomics Unit at Oxford, one of the lead authors of the study.

The first author of the paper, Dr Sreeram Ramagopalan from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, adds: "There is now evidence supporting a role for vitamin D in susceptibility to a host of diseases. Vitamin D supplements during pregnancy and the early years could have a beneficial effect on a child's health in later life. Some countries such as France have instituted this as a routine public health measure."

The main source of vitamin D in the body comes from exposing the skin to sunlight, although a diet of oily fish can provide some of the vitamin. Research has previously suggested that lighter skin colour and hair colour evolved in populations moving to parts of the globe with less sun to optimise production of vitamin D in the body. A lack of vitamin D can affect bone development, leading to rickets; in pregnant mothers, poor bone health can be fatal to both mother and child at birth, hence there are selective pressures in favour of people who are able to produce adequate vitamin D.

This new study supports this hypothesis, having found a significant number of vitamin D receptor binding sites in regions of the genome with genetic changes more commonly found in people of European and Asian descent. It is probable that skin lightening as we migrated out of Africa resulted from the necessity to be able to make more vitamin D and prevent rickets: vitamin D deficiency led to pelvic contraction resulting in increased risk of fatality of both mother and unborn child, effectively ending maternal lineages unable to find ways of increasing availability of the vitamin.

"Vitamin D status is potentially one of the most powerful selective pressures on the genome in relatively recent times," says Professor George Ebers, Action Medical Research Professor of Clinical Neurology and one of the senior authors of the paper. "Our study appears to support this interpretation and it may be we have not had enough time to make all the adaptations we have needed to cope with our northern circumstances."

## Summary of the paper by Dr David Grimes (Updated Sept 20, 2010)

### He is the author of  VITAMIN D and cholesterol - The importance of the sun

### His web site is http://www.vitamin-d-deficiency.co.uk/

Vitamin D is a pre-hormone, synthesised in the skin by the action of the sun, and also obtained from diet, especially from fish. It is converted in the body to calcidiol and then to calcitriol, its active form and the real hormone. A hormone is a chemical messenger that transmits a signal from one part of the body to another, to target cells, which contain specific receptors. When it reaches the target cells by circulation in the blood, calcitriol binds to its vitamin D receptor (VDR), and it is the VDR that is responsible for actions within the cells. VDRs are complex proteins that are inherited and are therefore found within the genome, the intra-nuclear DNA. The VDR inside the target cells then combines with retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form a “hetero-dimer”. This in turn binds with vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs), which influence gene transcription and which activate genes.

The laboratory method used in this study is that of “ChIP-seq” (chromatin immuno-precipitation with massively parallel sequencing). It used lymphoblastoid cells.

The study confirmed VDR binding with specific genes, including the VDR gene itself. 

The research paper confirms VDR binding sites on the genome, but of great importance it identified that calcitriol enriches the genome VDR binding sites. 

This demonstrates a very important role for vitamin D.

2776 VDR binding sites were identified.

Many genes were influenced by vitamin D as calcitriol: 226 genes were significantly up-regulated and three were significantly down-regulated by calcitriol stimulation.

The genes significantly enriched were those associated with immune functions.

The action of VDR is of major importance as a gene transcription factor activated by calcitriol (a “ligand”, a chemical messenger from outside a cell that activates processes within the cell). 

The study illustrates how specific genetic and environmental risk factors may interact. Given the very rapid recent increase in knowledge of genes (strictly “genomic loci”) that are important in common diseases, the study sought to determine whether VDR binding sites preferentially occur within specific disease genomic intervals.

The genomic intervals studied included those for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Crohn’s disease (CD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), together with 44 other common conditions.

Strikingly significant enrichment for VDR binding was found in the genomic intervals for MS, T1D, CD, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), colorectal cancer, hair colour, tanning, and height.

This analysis highlighted a number of gene loci in which roles for vitamin D in gene regulation had not previously been proposed. For example, VDR binding sites involving IRF8, which is associated with MS, and in PTPN2, a gene locus strongly implicated in both Crohns disease and T1D. Both genes showed increased expression after calcitriol, and similarly gene loci such as PTPN22 and CD226, which have been strongly associated with autoimmune disease.

Also observed was significant enrichment of VDR binding by calcitriol in genes that are expressed in all MS forms, compared with controls.
