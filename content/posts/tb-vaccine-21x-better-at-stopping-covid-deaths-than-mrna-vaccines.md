* “Jirjees et al found that the occurrence of death due to COVID-19 was 21-fold lower in countries with a  **national BCG vaccination policy**  “

 **BCG seems to activate the immune system. It fights far more than TB**

* “Besides protection against tuberculosis, BCG has been shown to reduce the mortality of children due to infection by unrelated pathogens due to a non-specific immune cross-protection”

* “Kühtreiber et al found that, late in the US pandemic, multi-dose BCG vaccines provided significant protection against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in type 1 diabetics, while COVID-19 mRNA vaccines alone showed no measurable protection against COVID-19 disease”

* “Lastly, a new study by Jalalizadeh et al found that BCG vaccination  **protects against long COVID** ”

 **Far fewer adverse events per million jabs**

#### Highlights of conversations with Perplexity AI Dec 2024

* "As of 2022, the majority of countries (156 out of 194, or  **80.4%) recommend universal BCG vaccination for all neonates** "

* "The BCG vaccine is usually given as a single dose as soon after birth as possible, ideally around 28 days old"

* "Remember, the BCG vaccine is usually **given only once in a lifetime** , and its administration should be carefully timed in relation to other vaccinations and health conditions."

* Active ingredient: Live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), Danish strain 1331"

* "UNICEF reports a projected weighted average price (WAP) of  **$0.14 USD per dose**  for 2023"

* "The vaccine is prepared as a powder that is reconstituted with a solvent before use"
