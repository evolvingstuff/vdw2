#### Effect of Genetically Low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D on Mortality Risk: Mendelian Randomization Analysis in 3 Large European Cohorts

Nutrients 2019, 11(1), 74; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11010074

<div class="border" style="background-color:#FFFAE2;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:750px">

This Mendelian study used data from "only" ~10,000 people, and was not statistically significant

However, it found trends similar to many meta-analyses

Appears that 40-60 ng level of vitamin D is great

No information for > 60 ng

* Note: Unaware of any study which also considers the effects of 3 Vitamin D genes on mortality

* Suspect that death rate is decreased even more if have good gene activation along in addition to high vitamin D level in blood

* The Vitamin D Receptor is one of 3 genes which are not noticed by a Vitamin D blood test

*  **The risk of <span style="color:#F00;">40 </span> diseases at least double with poor [Vitamin D Receptor](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) as of July 2019**
