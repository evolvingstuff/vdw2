## Clipped from [You could take vitamin D or . . .](http://www.trackyourplaque.com/blog/2011/08/you-could-take-vitamin-d-or.html?%20)  August 26, 2011 Dr. William Davis

### You could take vitamin D and achieve a desirable blood level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (I aim for 60-70 ng/ml), or you could:

* Take Actos to mimic the enhanced insulin sensitivity generated by vitamin D

* Take lisinopril to mimic the angiotensin-converting enzyme blocking, antihypertensive effect of vitamin D

* Take Fosamax or Boniva to mimic the bone density-increasing effect of vitamin D

* Take Celexa or other SSRI antidepressants to mimic the mood-elevating and winter “blues”-relieving effect of vitamin D

* Take Niaspan to mimic the HDL-increasing, small LDL-reducing effect of vitamin D

* Take naproxen to mimic the pain-relieving effect of vitamin D

## Note: Each drug is far more expensive than vitamin D AND focuses on only one aspect.
