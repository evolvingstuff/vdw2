PURPOSE:

The association between vitamin D and prostate biopsy outcomes has not been evaluated. We examine serum vitamin D levels with prostate biopsy results in men with an abnormal prostate-specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) was obtained from 667 men, ages 40 to 79 years, prospectively enrolled from Chicago urology clinics undergoing first prostate biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between 25-OH D status and incident prostate cancer, Gleason score, and tumor stage.

RESULTS:

Among  **European American**  (EA) men, there was an association of 25-OH D  **<12 ng/mL** with 

* higher Gleason score ≥ 4+4 <span>[OR, 3.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41-9.50; P = 0.008]</span> and 

* tumor stage <span>[stage ≥ cT2b vs. ≤ cT2a, OR, 2.42 (1.14-5.10); P = 0.008]</span>. 

In  **African American**  (AA) men, we find 

* increased odds of prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy with 25-OH D < 20 ng/mL <span>[OR, 2.43 (1.20-4.94); P = 0.01]</span>. 

 **AA**  men demonstrated an association between 25-OH D 

* < 12 ng/mL and Gleason ≥ 4+4 <span>[OR, __4.89__ (1.59-15.07); P = 0.006]</span>. 

There was an association with tumor stage ≥ cT2b vs. ≤ cT2a <span>[OR, 4.22 (1.52-11.74); P = 0.003]</span>.

CONCLUSIONS:

In AA men, vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of prostate cancer diagnosis on biopsy. In both EA and AA men, severe deficiency was positively associated with higher Gleason grade and tumor stage.
