#### Asked Bard about High intensity exercise increasing the vitamin D getting to cells - Dec 6, 2023

The evidence suggests that high intensity exercise may increase the amount of vitamin D getting to cells, though the effects are complex and depend on several factors. Here's a breakdown of what we know:

 **Potential mechanisms for increased vitamin D delivery:** 

* Mobilization from storage: Exercise can stimulate the release of vitamin D from adipose tissue and other storage sites, making it available for circulation and uptake by cells.

* Increased blood flow: High-intensity exercise increases blood flow, which can facilitate the delivery of vitamin D to various tissues.

* Enhanced VDR expression: Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are essential for cellular uptake and utilization of vitamin D. Studies suggest that exercise may increase the expression of VDRs in certain tissues, leading to improved vitamin D utilization.

* Hormonal changes: Exercise induces the release of hormones like catecholamines and growth hormone, which might influence vitamin D metabolism and transport.

 **_Supporting evidence:** 

Studies have shown that high-intensity exercise can significantly increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in vitamin D-deficient individuals. This suggests improved mobilization and circulation of vitamin D.

Research indicates that a single bout of high-intensity interval training can lead to a temporary increase in circulating 25(OH)D levels.

Some studies suggest that regular high-intensity exercise may be more effective than moderate-intensity exercise in increasing vitamin D status.

 **However, there are also some caveats to consider:** 

* The effect of exercise on vitamin D levels might depend on factors like baseline vitamin D status, training volume, and individual differences in response to exercise.

* More research is needed to fully understand the long-term impact of high-intensity exercise on vitamin D metabolism and cellular uptake.

Overall, while high-intensity exercise may offer some benefits for vitamin D delivery to cells, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding vitamin D supplementation and exercise strategies. They can assess your individual needs and recommend the best course of action based on your specific situation.

 **Asked BARD for research that supports the previous** 

Research Supporting the Relationship Between High Intensity Exercise and Vitamin D Levels:

“Impact of Vitamin D on Physical Efficiency and Exercise Performance—A Review” (2020): This review discusses the connection between vitamin D and physical performance, highlighting its role in muscle function and immune response. It also mentions that exercise, specifically endurance training, can increase vitamin D levels in individuals with deficiency. 

“Exercise: A Possibly Effective Way to Improve Vitamin D Nutritional Status” (2022): This article explores the potential of exercise to improve vitamin D status, particularly in individuals with deficiency. It suggests that  **endurance exercise can promote the release of vitamin D metabolites from adipose tissue** , ultimately increasing serum 25(OH)D levels. 

“High-Intensity Physical Activity with High Serum Vitamin D Levels is Associated with a Low Prevalence of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis: A Population-Based Study” (2021): This study investigated the relationship between high-intensity physical activity, vitamin D levels, and bone health. It found a link between high-intensity activity and lower prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis, especially when combined with sufficient vitamin D levels.
