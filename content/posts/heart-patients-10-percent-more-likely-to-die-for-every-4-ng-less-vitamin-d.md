AIMS:

Vitamin D status has been implicated in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). The aims of this study were to determine whether a low vitamin D status is associated with prognosis in HF and whether activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and inflammatory markers could explain this potential association.

METHODS AND RESULTS:

We measured 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D), plasma renin activity (PRA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the incidence of death or HF rehospitalization in 548 patients with HF. Median age was 74 (64-80) years, left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% (23-42), and mean follow-up was 18 months. 

Low 25(OH)D levels were associated with 

* female gender (P< 0.001), 

* higher age (P= 0.002), and 

* higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (P< 0.001). 

Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that PRA (P= 0.048), and CRP levels (P= 0.006) were independent predictors of 25(OH)D levels. 

During follow-up, 155 patients died and 142 patients were rehospitalized. 

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lower 25(OH)D concentration was associated with an increased risk for the combined endpoint (all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalization; log rank test P= 0.045) and increased risk for all-cause mortality (log rank test P= 0.014). 

After adjustment in a multivariable Cox regression analysis, low 25(OH)D concentration remained independently associated with an increased risk for the combined endpoint [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09 per 10 nmol/L decrease; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.16; P= 0.040](hazard%20ratio%20(HR)%201.09%20per%2010%20nmol/L%20decrease;%2095%%20confidence%20interval%20(CI)%201.00-1.16;%20P=%200.040) and 

* all-cause mortality (HR 1.10 per 10 nmol/L decrease; 95% CI 1.00-1.22; P= 0.049).

CONCLUSION:

A low 25(OH)D concentration is associated with a poor prognosis in HF patients. 

Activation of the RAS and inflammation may confer the adverse effects of low vitamin D levels.
