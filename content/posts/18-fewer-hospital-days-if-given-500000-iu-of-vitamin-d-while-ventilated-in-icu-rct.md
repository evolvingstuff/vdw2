 **VitaminDWiki suspects even fewer days if had**  

* Extended the time beyond just 5 days

* Added cofactors such as Magnesium and Omega-3

* Increased the dose for those who were obese

* had started with a loading dose of say 300,000 IU - improving the immune sysem 3 days sooner

* Increased the dose for those who were very vitamin D deficient

 **Highlights** 

• First double blind RCT of vitamin D therapy in mechanically ventilated patients

• Treatment with placebo, 250000 IU or 500000 IU enteral vitamin D3 was well tolerated

• Significant increase in plasma 25(OH)D from baseline to day 7

• Significant decrease in hospital length of stay for vitamin D3 treated subjects

• No change in plasma LL-37 according to treatment group

Background: There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the critically ill patient population. Several intensive care unit studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 20 ng/mL](25-hydroxyvitamin%20D%20(25(OH)D)%20<%2020%20ng/mL) and increased hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission rate, sepsis and mortality.

Material and Methods: Pilot, double blind randomized control trial conducted on mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients. Subjects were administered either placebo, 50,000 IU vitamin D3 or 100,000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 5 consecutive days enterally (total vitamin D3 dose = 250,000 IU or 500,000 IU, respectively). The primary outcome was plasma 25(OH)D concentration 7 days after oral administration of study drug. Secondary outcomes were plasma levels of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin (LL37), hospital LOS, SOFA score, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital mortality, mortality at 12 weeks, and hospital acquired infection.

Results: A total of  **31 subjects** were enrolled with 13 (43%) being vitamin D deficient at entry (25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL). The 250,000 IU and 500,000 IU vitamin D3 regimens each resulted in a significant increase in mean plasma 25(OH)D concentrations from baseline to day 7; values rose to 45.7±19.6 ng/mL and 55.2 ± 14.4 ng/mL, respectively, compared to essentially no change in the placebo group (21±11.2 ng/mL), p<0.001. There was a significant decrease in hospital length of stay over time in the 250,000 IU and the 500,000 IU vitamin D3 group, compared to the placebo group (25 ± 14 and 18 ± 11 days compared to 36 ± 19 days, respectively; p=0.03). There was no statically significant change in plasma LL-37 concentrations or other clinical outcomes by group over time.

Conclusions: In this pilot study, high-dose vitamin D3 safely increased plasma 25(OH)D concentrations into the sufficient range and was associated with decreased hospital length of stay without altering other clinical outcomes.
