Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains one of the most common reasons for paediatric morbidity and accounts for about  **16% of all the deaths**  occurring in children less than 5 years of age. Areas covered: The main aim of this paper is to discuss the emerging problems for CAP treatment in paediatric age. Expert commentary: Official recommendations for therapeutic approaches to paediatric CAP, despite being not very recent, seem still to be the best solution to assure the highest probabilities of cure for children with this disease living in industrialized countries. 

Amoxicillin remains the drug of choice and use of macrolides alone or in combination does not seem supported by solid evidence. Corticosteroids can be useful in CAP associated with bronco-obstruction, whereas their effectiveness in cases with a severe inflammatory response, although plausible, is not supported by data collected through randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Finally, for the administration of vitamin C and  **vitamin D** , the available data are not adequate to draw firm conclusions regarding the real importance of supplementation. Further studies are needed to evaluate which modifications of presently available recommendations for paediatric CAP treatment can improve final prognosis of this still common disease.
