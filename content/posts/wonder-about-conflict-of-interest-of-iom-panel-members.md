There are so many things wrong with the IoM report.  <a href="/posts/click-here-for-some" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1193">CLICK HERE for some</a>

 **Started wondering why the panel seemed to totally ignore the science** 

### A 2010 book: [White Coat, Black Hat](http://www.amazon.com/White-Coat-Black-Hat-Adventures/dp/0807061425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291342963&sr=8-1) describes the many conflict of interest problems very well.

* Note: the book pointed out that fewer than 10% of the authors who actually had a conflict of interest reported it in their papers.

* A portion of conflict of interests problems concerns money - but money is easy to track, so let's "Follow the money"

* Here is an initial investigation into the idea that some panel members would have lost money if they said that vitamin D was good
