Breast Cancer Prevention Month--Action!

GrassrootsHealth continues to challenge the health paradigms: 

"It's time to shift from awareness to prevention" says Carole Baggerly, director of the organization.

October is now 'Breast Cancer Prevention Month' and, GrassrootsHealth is providing  **free vitamin D tests for 1000 women 60 and older during this month** 

to initiate a  **5 year study to truly prevent breast cancer** .  "Fully 75% of ordinary breast cancer could be prevented" says Cedric F. Garland, Dr. P.H., the principal investigator of this study.  Donations are also needed to keep the project going for its 5 year span.  [ **<span style="color:#F00;">Donate Now</span>** !](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=sskbw4cab&et=1108099925285&s=11329&e=0019PRJ6ZyEKD34y6Ib5tiE9MzaKqL3syo0mq-6DH9T17h_Yth4cpLiW0SCecXaoR2Brhba8BS2p4nr9Km5CcN-muqylcnaD-MlSz6NTVXgu5stlj0pUukTONPxc13rI5_p_Ru7TXnLlos=)

We expect to fully enroll 1000 women in this study this month so if you or your friends/associates OR community organizations want to participate in the 5 year study, now's the time!

## Requirements for a free test:

1) be a woman over the age of 60

2) not currently have cancer

3) not currently being treated for cancer

4) be willing to test each 6 months and fill in an online health questionnaire

Please check out our website, GrassrootsHealth for more information and an interview with Dr. Garland.  You may click on Enroll to start the enrollment process now.

Last, but not at all least, please help us spread the word to more and more women that they can prevent breast cancer with your Donation. 

Start a new 'greeting' when you meet someone during Breast Cancer Prevention Month:  Instead of saying 'How are you?' try

'Will you help me prevent breast cancer this month?'

Thanks so much for your interest in truly stopping this disease and, helping spread the word!

Healthily yours,

Carole A Baggerly
