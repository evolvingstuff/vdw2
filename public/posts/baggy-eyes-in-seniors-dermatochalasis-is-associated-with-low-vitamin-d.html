The DC Group was then divided into 3 subgroups according to the marginal reflex distance (MRD4). The lymphatic vessel (LV) count and diameter of the largest LV (DLLV) were recorded, the stromal collagen bed (SCB) was observed, and its depth was measured, the interfibrillar edema was examined, and the elastic fiber and macrophage counts and recorded, respectively, and then all of these were evaluated. The SVD levels were compared between the DC patients and the C-Group.</p><p>Results</p><p>In comparison to the C-Group, significant changes were seen in the dilated LV, DLLV, SCB depth, interfibrillar edema, elastic fiber density, and macrophage count in the DC sub-Groups (P &lt; 0.001 for all). While no difference was found between DC sub-Group 1 (MRD4 > 4 mm) and the C-Group (P > 0.05), a significant difference was found between DC sub-Group 2 (MRD4 2–4 mm) and DC sub-Group 3 (MRD4 &lt; 2 mm) for all of the parameters (P &lt; 0.05). A statistically significant difference was also found in the SVD levels between the DC sub-Group 1 and DC sub-Groups 2–3 (P &lt; 0.017, P &lt; 0.001 respectively).</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>According to the results of this study, SVD level was significantly lower in DC group. Moreover, an increased LV count and diameter, decreased elastic fiber count, collagen fiber and stromal edema irregularity, and increased macrophage count were found to be associated with the SVD level.</p><hr><h4 id=evaluation-of-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-levels-in-patients-with-dermatochalasis---aug-2023>Evaluation of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with dermatochalasis - Aug 2023</h4><p>International Ophthalmology Vol 43, pages 749–756, (2023) <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-022-02474-4>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-022-02474-4</a></p><p>PDF behind paywall <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/evaluation-of-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-levels-in-patients-with-AzkzZUJzMX?key=springer">Can be rented at DeepDyve</a></p><p>Sevim Ayça Seyyar & Ecem Onder Tokuc</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/baggy-time-of-year.webp alt=image width=400><p>Purpose</p><p>To compare serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels of patients with dermatochalasis who underwent upper lid blepharoplasty and healthy controls.</p><p>Methods</p><p>This retrospective comparative study included dermatochalasis patients who underwent upper lid blepharoplasty and age-and sex-matched controls from January 2019 to January 2021. The data, including comprehensive ophthalmological examination, internal medicine outpatient examination, and laboratory results of the dermatochalasis patients and healthy controls, were collected from the electronic patient records. Serum 25(OH)D, creatinine, calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were evaluated and compared between the dermatochalasis patients and healthy controls.</p><p>Result</p><p>Of our participants, consisting of 46 patients with dermatochalasis and 52 healthy controls, 54 (55.10%) were female and 44 (44.90%) were male. A statistically significant difference was observed in vitamin D levels between the healthy and dermatochalasis groups (p ≤ 0.001). The percentage of individuals with vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 20 ng/mL) was significantly higher in the dermatochalasis group (p = 0.001). In addition, the percentage of individuals with severe vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 10 ng/mL) was again significantly higher in the dermatochalasis group (p = 0.001).</p><p><strong>The risk of dermatochalasis incidence was found to increase in cases of low vitamin D (OR = 1.210; p = 0.017).</strong></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Low serum 25(OH)D levels may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of dermatochalasis. Future research should include longitudinal studies and prospective clinical studies to investigate the mechanism responsible for the low vitamin D observed in dermatochalasis patients.</p><hr><h4 id=floppy-eye-syndrome-chapter-in-dry-eye-book---2019httpswwwgooglecombookseditiondry_eye_diseaseq9wleqaaqbajhlengbpv1dqdermatochalasis22vitamind22pgpt82printsecfrontcover>Floppy Eye Syndrome <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dry_Eye_Disease/q9wLEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=dermatochalasis+%22vitamin+d%22&amp;pg=PT82&amp;printsec=frontcover">(Chapter in Dry Eye book) - 2019</a></h4></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384339"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384339",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384339"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384339"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384339"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384339"></script></body></html>
