When trying to purchase another Vitamin D test at Life Extension Foundation I got the following pleasant message

Life Extensionâ€™s research has found that if a person is not taking at least  **5000IU**  of vitamin D a day they will likely be below an  **optimal blood value of 50ng/mL.** 

Life Extension suggests most people take this amount for at least 1 month before doing their vitamin D blood test. 

Please see our January 2010 magazine article "Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members" for more details.
