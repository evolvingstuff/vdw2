 **Most highly successful uses of high-dose Vitamin D have a lot in common** 

Evolved over a period of 4 - 16 years

60+ ng of vitamin D is needed - see also <a href="/posts/is-50-ng-of-vitamin-d-too-high-just-right-or-not-enough-when-increasing-vitamin--s-in-a-nutshell" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Is 50 ng of vitamin D too high, just right, or not enough))
When increasing Vitamin D, it is important to also increase ((Vitamin D Cofactors in a nutshell">cofactors</a>: [Omega-3](/posts/overview-omega-3-many-benefits-include-helping-vitamin-d), [Magnesium](/posts/overview-magnesium-and-vitamin-d), [Vitamin K](/posts/overview-vitamin-k-and-vitamin-d) and some B vitamins

The dose size typically varies both with the [weight](/posts/obese-need-2x-to-3x-more-vitamin-d) of the adult and individual need

None have generated any clinical trials. Their goal is success, not publication

Also, trials generally require same dose for everyone. with no changing of the dose during  treatment

Use a pill containing many B Vitamins B50 (or B100)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B-6, Folic Acid, Vitamin B-12, Biotin, Pantothenic Acid,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which apparently is B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12. - at least 50mg of each

 **As of 2019, none appear to (but probably should)** 

* Employ ways to [increase the response to vitamin D dose](/posts/reasons-for-low-response-to-vitamin-d)

* Use one of the many [gut-friendly forms](/posts/overview-gut-and-vitamin-d) of Vitamin D when needed

* [Prescribe weekly or biweekly doses instead of daily](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need) which appears to provide higher response and more benefit

* Try to increase Vitamin D [in the tissue](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor), rather than just in the blood

   * Using one of more of: Resveratrol, Quercetin, Progesterone, high-intensity exercise and cofactors: Omega-3, Magnesium, Zinc

   * The founder of VitaminDWiki uses 10 of them
