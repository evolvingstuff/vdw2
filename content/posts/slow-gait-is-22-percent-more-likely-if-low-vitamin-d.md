#### Is serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency a risk factor for the incidence of slow gait speed in older individuals? Evidence from the English longitudinal study of ageing

Diabetes Obes Metab. 2025 Jun;27(6):3104-3112. [doi: 10.1111/dom.16317](https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.16317)

Aims: Cross-sectional studies demonstrate an association between low serum levels of vitamin D and slower gait speed in older individuals. However, longitudinal studies remain inconclusive. This study investigates whether vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are risk factors for the incidence of slowness.

Materials and methods: A total of 2815 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), aged ≥60 years and with a baseline gait speed >0.8 m/s, were followed for six years. Baseline serum levels of vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> were categorized as "sufficiency" (>50 nmol/L), "insufficiency" (>30 and ≤50 nmol/L) or "deficiency" (≤30 nmol/L). Gait speed was reassessed at four and six years of follow-up to identify incident cases of slowness (walking speed ≤0.8 m/s). A Poisson regression model, adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics at baseline, was conducted to determine the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and the risk of slowness.

Results: The incidence densities of slowness per 1000 person-years were 

* 67.4 (95% CI: 60.93-74.64) for sufficiency, 

* 76.7 (95% CI: 68.30-86.22) for insufficiency and 

* 90.7 (95% CI: 78.46-104.92) for deficiency. 

Serum 25(OH)D deficiency was associated with a 22% increase in the risk of slowness ( **IRR: 1.22** ; 95% CI: 1.01-1.49) compared with serum 25(OH)D sufficiency. No significant association was observed for serum 25(OH)D insufficiency.

Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D deficiency is a risk factor for the incidence of slowness in older individuals, suggesting that maintaining sufficient 25(OH)D levels could be a strategic approach to minimise long-term mobility impairment.
