 **Well known: Corticosteroids are associated with low levels of Vitamin D** 

 **Wonder how the Asthmatic children got 2X more intake of vitamin D** 

 **1) Got 400 IU vitamin D supplement, 2) Chose to eat more foods with higher Vitamin D Levels, 3)?**

Background. We assessed vitamin D intakes and serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels in pediatric asthma patients on moderate-to-high dose inhaled steroids and compared them to published findings of healthy children in our city. 

Methods. Parents and/or patients were interviewed to estimate the children's vitamin D intakes from foods and supplements (using an adapted validated food frequency questionnaire) and asthma duration and management. Vitamin D status: serum 25-hyroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was obtained from the medical records. 

Results. Vitamin D intakes from food and supplements of the asthma patients (n = 20, 742 ± 185 IU/day) were significantly higher compared to healthy Canadian children (n = 1442, 229 ± 121 IU/day). Despite higher vitamin D intakes, the children had nonsignificantly lower serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels compared to the comparison group. Serum 25(OH)D levels increased by 3.6 nmol/L with each 100 IU of vitamin D intake (95% Confidence interval = 2.0-4.0, R2 = 0.931, and p = 0.001). 

Conclusion. Since adequate vitamin D status in asthma patients is necessary to support bone mineral accretion, it is important to achieve adequate vitamin D status by checking serum 25(OH)D status and supplement accordingly.
