### [Alliance for Natural Health International](http://anh-europe.org/news/anh-commissions-new-TNO-vitamin-safety-approach) Nov 2013

Funded a 6 month study of risk-benefit for some vitamins (we hope they include vitamin D)

Dutch Group funded = [Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)](http://www.tno.nl/index.cfm?Taal=2)

## VitaminDWiki sent the following email to TNO Nov 15

Happy to see that you have been funded by ANH to study the risk-benefits of Vitamins. 

I would be happy to guide you thru >5,000 publications on Vitamin D - some of which directly discuss risk-benefits.  

There are, by the way, now 37 intervention studies published which have used vitamin D with great success. is.gd/proofvitd.

Look forward to hearing from you
