Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Oxidative stress appears to be a prominent contributor to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of human observational and interventional studies to investigate the role of some antioxidants such as vitamins A, E, D, and C, selenium, zinc, and α-lipoic acid in the main clinical outcomes of subjects with COVID-19. Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline were searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH terms without restrictions. 

Finally, 36 studies for vitamins C and D, selenium, and zinc were included in this systematic review; however, no eligible studies were found for vitamins A and E as well as α-lipoic acid. 

The results showed the promising role of 

* vitamin C in inflammation, Horowitz index, and mortality; 

* vitamin D in disease manifestations and severity, inflammatory markers, lung involvement, ventilation requirement, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality; 

* selenium in cure rate and mortality; and 

* zinc in ventilation requirement, hospitalization, ICU admission, biomarkers of inflammation and bacterial infection, and disease complications. 

In conclusion, it seems that antioxidants, especially vitamins C and D, selenium, and zinc, can improve multiple COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, more studies are necessary to affirm these results.
