!!!!Why are so many young people getting cancer? - April 2024
__[https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research|VOX]__
*&quot;Clinicians have especially been noticing a rise in cancers in the gastrointestinal (GI) system — including colorectal, kidney, and pancreatic cancers — in adults younger than 50, the cutoff for what is usually considered early-onset cancer.&quot;
*&quot; A BMJ article published last year found that the early onset of 29 different cancers, including breast, stomach, and colorectal, had risen __nearly 80 percent__ between 1990 and 2019 worldwide.&quot;
*&quot;Early in his career (Gastrointestinal Cancers), he says, he would never have a patient under the age of 50. Today, half of his patients are in that younger cohort, many of them otherwise healthy and fit&quot;
*&quot;...$25 million project ....to investigate the leading lifestyle and environmental risk factors — from toxins to diets high in ultra-processed foods...&quot;
*Also. speculated on microplastics
**See VitaminDWiki - ((Microplastics causing problems in most life forms (Vitamin D might help)- many studies))
* No mention of ((Vitamin D levels have been crashing since 1995 (Polish Children, Elite Military, etc)|Vitamin D Crashing))
