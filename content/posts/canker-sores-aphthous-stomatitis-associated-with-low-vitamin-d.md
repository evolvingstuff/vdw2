This study only reports an association.

It does not indicate if

1. Low Vitamin D ==> Canker Sore

1. Canker Sore ==> low Vitamin D

1. Vitamin D witll treat the Canker Sore

* [Canker sores (aphthous stomatitis ) may be triggered by low vitamin D – Sept 2014](/posts/canker-sores-aphthous-stomatitis-may-be-triggered-by-low-vitamin-d)

Note: It appears that Canker Sores occure more often in the winter (when the is low vitamin D)

BACKGROUND:

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is one of the most prevalent oral mucosa diseases and the etiology is unclear. As a potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating agent, vitamin D can significantly affect oral cavity homeostasis. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted in pediatric population on the potential role of vitamin D in recurrent aphthous stomatitis to date. The aim of the present study is to determine the vitamin D status in recurrent aphthous stomatitis in children.

METHODS:

This study is conducted retrospectively. Seventy-two patients with minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis and 70 age-matched healthy controls included in the study. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured in all patients using enzyme immunoassay.

RESULTS:

Serum vitamin D levels were 16.4 (8.6) ng/mL in patient group and 23.1 (11.5) ng/mL in healthy controls. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of serum vitamin D levels (P = .002). There was no significant correlation between serum vitamin D levels and the severity of the recurrent aphthous stomatitis (r = 0.54, P = .76).

CONCLUSIONS:

Our study showed a significant difference in vitamin D levels between patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis and the healthy control group. We also found no correlation between vitamin D status and the severity of the disease.
