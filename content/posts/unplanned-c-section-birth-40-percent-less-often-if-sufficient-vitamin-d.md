OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of maternal circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3]</span> concentration with pregnancy and birth outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.

SETTING: Four geographical areas of Spain, 2003-2008.

POPULATION: Of 2382 mother-child pairs participating in the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project.

METHODS: Maternal circulating 25(OH)D3 concentration was measured in pregnancy (mean <span>[SD]</span> 13.5 <span>[2.2]</span> weeks of gestation). We tested associations of maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration with pregnancy and birth outcomes.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery, caesarean section, fetal growth restriction (FGR) and small-for-gestational age (SGA), anthropometric birth outcomes including weight, length and head circumference (HC).

RESULTS:

Overall, 31.8% and 19.7% of women had vitamin D insufficiency [25(OH)D3 20-29.99 ng/ml](25(OH)D3%2020-29.99%20ng/ml) and deficiency [25(OH)D3 < 20 ng/ml](25(OH)D3%20<%2020%20ng/ml), respectively. After adjustment, there was no association between maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration and risk of GDM or preterm delivery.  **Women with sufficient vitamin D [25(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/ml](25(OH)D3%20≥%2030%20ng/ml) had a decreased risk of caesarean section by obstructed labour compared with women with vitamin D deficiency [relative risk (RR) = 0.60, 95% CI 0.37, 0.97).** Offspring of mothers with higher circulating 25(OH)D3 concentration tended to have smaller HC <span>[coefficient (SE) per doubling concentration of 25(OH)D3, -0.10 (0.05), P = 0.038]</span>. No significant associations were found for other birth outcomes.

CONCLUSION:

This study did not find any evidence of an association between vitamin D status in pregnancy and GDM, preterm delivery, FGR, SGA and anthropometric birth outcomes. Results suggest that sufficient circulating vitamin D concentration [25(OH)D3 ≥ 30 ng/ml](25(OH)D3%20≥%2030%20ng/ml) in pregnancy may reduce the risk of caesarean section by obstructed labour.
