#### [Script with links, charts](/posts/video-references)

 **Script text** 

* ANNOUNCER: Have you ever wondered why we are seeing dramatic increases in health problems since our great-grandparents' time?

* A hundred years ago, people mainly lived and worked outdoors. 

* Many were farmers.

* Clothes were hung outside to dry.

* Children played outdoors. 

* Almost everyone spent most of their day outdoors.

* They rode horses.

* But now things have changed.

* Most of us work and play indoors, where we have air conditioning.

* We work more on computers than on farms.

* We wash and dry our clothes indoors.

* We watch TV and surf the Internet and play video games.

* We ride in air-conditioned autos and airplanes and trucks.

* We even swim indoors.

* So, what does all this indoor activity mean?

* Less sun!

* Could less sun be associated with more disease?

* Let's find out.

* From sunlight, our skin makes a vital substance, Vitamin D.

* Vitamin D, which is actually a hormone rather than a vitamin, has a major impact on our bodies. 

* It increases activation in more than 2000 genes. 

* This increased gene activation allows the body to combat disease.

* In fact, over 5000 scientific studies have shown the clear association of Vitamin D deficiency 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; with more than 100 diseases and health problems, most of which have seen dramatic increases over the past 50 years. 

* These include some of the big ones: cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, obesity, and heart disease.

* Even rickets, which supposedly had gone away 80 years ago, has reappeared.

* Are YOU at risk for these diseases? 

* Do YOU get enough Vitamin D? 

* Probably not.

* More than 9 out of 10 people worldwide don't get enough Vitamin D.

* Ask yourself: Do you spend a lot of time indoors? 

* Do you wear sunscreen or protective clothing when you do go outdoors?

* Many people think that 10 minutes outdoors is enough to get all the Vitamin D they need from the sun.

* But the fact is, for most people, that unless you spend a fair amount of time outdoors every day in full sun with minimal clothing 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; and no sunscreen, you aren't getting enough Vitamin D to protect against disease. 

* You need to stay in the sun for 3 hours if you are standing up in a short sleeve shirt, 20 minutes if lying down in a bathing suit.

* Even food no longer provides as much Vitamin D as it did 100 years ago. 

* For example, in 1900, pie crust was made with lard from pigs raised outdoors. 

* Back then, just one piece of a double-crust pie provided 2000 iu of Vitamin D.

* Today, pie crust is made from vegetable oil or shortening. 

* How much Vitamin D? 

* Zero.

* The good news is, you don't need sunlight or lard from pigs raised outdoors in order to get your Vitamin D. 

* A simple supplement can provide all you need to prevent or even treat serious disease.

* But how do you find out if you have enough Vitamin D?

* You can, of course, have a blood test.

* A reading of at least 40 nanograms per milliliter, or 100 nanomoles per liter, is optimal.

* Or, you can do a quick, easy test on yourself. 

* You can stop this video and do it right now. 

* Just press hard on each of your shin bones and then on your sternum - the bone in your chest between your lowest ribs.

* Did at least two of them hurt?

* Sore bones are an indication that you are probably very deficient.

* So, let's say you are deficient - this is very likely if you have a major disease, or are elderly, have had recent surgery or illness, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or you are pregnant; a breastfed infant would also be at risk.

* How much Vitamin D should you take?

* This, of course, would depend on your individual situation, but many studies indicate that 4000 iu daily is necessary to bring the average adult up to 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 40 nanograms and maintain this healthy level.

* If you know you are at risk for being deficient, you might want to start with a larger dose.

* You may also want to take more than 4000 iu of Vitamin D daily if you are elderly, obese, or plan soon to get pregnant or have surgery.

* You should start feeling noticeably healthier and more energetic within a few days to weeks.

* Are people starting to notice the benefits of Vitamin D? 

* You bet!

* When one doctor raised all of his patients’ levels to 80 nanograms, or 200 nanomoles, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;he noticed that no matter their age or health condition, their average of 4 office visits per year dropped down to one visit.

* More and more people are getting Vitamin D tests, a 10 times increase in just 3 years.

* And research on Vitamin D has accelerated - more research has now been done on Vitamin D than on Vitamins A, C, E, and K combined.

* So, if you want to feel better and get or stay healthy, taking a Vitamin D supplement is probably the single best thing you can do for your body.

* And it won't cost you a trip to Hawaii.

* Do yourself a favor.

* Read the studies if you need more proof.

* Then try it.
