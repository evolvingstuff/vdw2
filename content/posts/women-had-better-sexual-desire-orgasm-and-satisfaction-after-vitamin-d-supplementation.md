BACKGROUND:

Hypovitaminosis D is associated with abnormal female sexual functioning. The aim of our study was to assess whether vitamin D supplementation affects sexual functioning and depressive symptoms in young women with low vitamin D status.

METHODS:

The study included 47 women with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. All women with vitamin D deficiency were treated with oral vitamin D, while women with vitamin D insufficiency were either treated with vitamin D or left untreated. At the beginning of the study and six months later, all patients completed questionnaires evaluating female sexual function (FSFI) and depressive symptoms (BDI-II).

RESULTS:

The total FSFI score and scores in three domains (sexual desire, orgasm and satisfaction) were lower while the overall BDI-II score was higher in women with vitamin D deficiency than in women with vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D improved sexual desire in women with both vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency, increased the total FSFI score and scores for orgasm and sexual satisfaction, as well as decreased the total BDI-II score in women with vitamin D deficiency.

CONCLUSIONS:

The obtained results indicate that vitamin D supplementation improves female sexual functioning and mood in women with low vitamin D status.

Half of women with 20-30 ng were given 2,000 IU daily

Half of women with 20-30 ng did not get any Vitamin D
