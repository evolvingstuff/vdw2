Departments of Radiology (V.G., A.K., A.O.M., T.A.L.W.) and Orthopaedic Surgery (V.G., T.A.L.W.), Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90027; and Department of Medicine (R.K.), McGill University Health Center, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada H9X 3V9.

 **Context:**  Vitamin D insufficiency has now reached epidemic proportions and has been linked to increased body fat and decreased muscle strength. Whether vitamin D insufficiency is also related to adipose tissue infiltration in muscle is not known. 

Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and the degree of fat infiltration in muscle. Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Outcome Measures and Subjects: Measures were anthropometric measures, serum 25OHD radioimmunoassay values, and computed tomography (CT) values of fat, muscle mass, and percent muscle fat in 90 postpubertal females, aged 16-22 yr, residing in California. 

 **Results:**  Approximately 59% of subjects were 25OHD insufficient (</=29 ng/ml), of which 24% were deficient (</=20 ng/ml), whereas 41% were sufficient (>/=30 ng/ml). A strong negative relationship was present between serum 25OHD and CT measures of percent muscle fat (r = -0.37; P < 0.001). In contrast, no relationship was observed between circulating 25OHD concentrations and CT measures of thigh muscle area (r = 0.16; P = 0.14). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the relation between 25OHD and muscle adiposity was independent of body mass or CT measures of sc and visceral fat. Percent muscle fat was significantly lower in women with normal serum 25OHD concentrations than in women with insufficient levels and deficient levels (3.15 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.90 +/- 1.9; P = 0.038). 

 **Conclusions:** We found that vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased fat infiltration in muscle in healthy young women.
