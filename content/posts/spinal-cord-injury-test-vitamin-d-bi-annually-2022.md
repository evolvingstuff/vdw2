Chapter Abstract

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a role in many functions in the body including musculoskeletal, immune, and neurological health. Vitamin D can be obtained through sun exposure, diet, and supplements; however, most Americans do not meet the recommended amount of vitamin D daily. Furthermore, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated to be around 40%. Athletes may be at an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency related to increased physical activity and enzymatic activity. Athletes with spinal cord injury (SCI) may be at even higher risk of vitamin D deficiency due to a lack of mobility, thermoregulatory dysfunction, and malabsorption concerns related to anticonvulsant medications. 

Athletes with SCI should be screened biannually for 25(OH)D status to determine whether supplementation is warranted. A 12- to 16-week sliding scale supplementation protocol based on the individualâ€™s vitamin D status can be applied for individuals with an insufficient or deficient status. However, it remains unclear if there is a relationship between athletic performance and vitamin D status and there is a need for more research in this area.
