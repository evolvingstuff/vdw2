##### LLLT section

 **LLLT:**  [Controlled clinical trials](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3944668/) have demonstrated that LLLT can stimulate hair growth in many types of non-scarring alopecia. LLLT acts on the mitochondria, improving cell metabolism through photodissociation of inhibitory nitric oxide off cytochrome C oxidase (in the mitochondrial respiratory chain), “allowing oxygen to replace it and allowing for more ATP synthesis and blood flow,” Tarbox said.

She referred to a 24-week [randomized, double-blind, controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30569416/) in which 40 patients with androgenetic alopecia (20 men and 20 women) were randomized to use a helmet-type LLLT device or a sham helmet at home. At week 24, the laser helmet was significantly superior to the sham device in increasing hair density and hair diameter (P = .002 and P = .009). Laser-treated patients had a significantly greater improvement in global photographic assessment by both investigators and patients.

The device “did seem to give patients a significantly improved perception of their hair loss and was also significant in the eyes of the investigators who were blinded,” Tarbox said. What was categorized as “moderate improvement” in the study “wasn’t overwhelming, but it was helpful,” she noted.

Asked during a question-and-answer period how to choose LLLT caps, she said, “It’s all about the wavelengths.” Most studies looking at the effects of LLLT on hair growth have used wavelengths between 635 nm and 660 nm.

 **Both the modulation and the higher frequency appear to be very important**
