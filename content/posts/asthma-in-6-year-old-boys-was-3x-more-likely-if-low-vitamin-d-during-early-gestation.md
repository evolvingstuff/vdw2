Rationale: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with chronic lung disease. We have previously shown in an in vivo mouse model that maternal vitamin D deficiency is associated with alterations in early life lung structure and function. However, there are limited data to support a relationship between maternal vitamin D deficiency during the early stages of lung development and post-natal lung function in human populations. 

Objectives: To assess the association between maternal vitamin D deficiency, post-natal lung function and asthmatic status in a longitudinal birth cohort. 

Methods: Serum was collected at 16-20 weeks gestation at the time of recruitment in a community based prospective birth cohort for measurement of vitamin D (25(OH)D). Lung function was assessed by spirometry according to ATS guidelines in children at 6 and 14 years of age. Demographic and clinical history data were collected by questionnaire at recruitment and at the follow up visits. 

Measurements and Main Results: FVC Z-scores in both sexes (β; 0.007<span>[0.001, 0.013]</span>, p = 0.02) and FEV1 Z-scores in females (β; 0.007<span>[0.001, 0.013]</span>, p = 0.02) were positively associated with maternal serum 25(OH)D at 6 years of age. These associations were mostly absent at 14 years of age. Maternal vitamin D deficiency was positively associated with asthma at 6 years of age but only in males (OR; 3.03(1.02-9.02), p = 0.04). 

Conclusions: This study supports the notion that vitamin D deficiency during lung development may impact on post-natal lung growth and increase the risk of developing lung disease.
