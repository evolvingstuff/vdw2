The injury severity impacts the overall outcome and likelihood for survival. Current treatment of acute TBI includes surgical intervention and supportive care therapies. Treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and optimizing cerebral perfusion are cornerstones of current therapy. These approaches do not directly address the secondary neurological sequelae that lead to continued brain injury after TBI. Depending on injury severity, a complex cascade of processes are activated and generate continued endogenous changes affecting cellular systems and overall outcome from the initial insult to the brain. Homeostatic cellular processes governing calcium influx, mitochondrial function, membrane stability, redox balance, blood flow and cytoskeletal structure often become dysfunctional after TBI. Interruption of this cascade has been the target of numerous pharmacotherapeutic agents investigated over the last two decades. Many agents such as selfotel, pegorgotein (PEG-SOD), <strong>magnesium</strong> , deltibant and dexanabinol were <strong>ineffective in clinical trials</strong> . While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending. Consequently, no neuroprotective treatment options currently exist that improve neurological outcome after TBI. Investigations to date have extended understanding of the injury mechanisms and sites for intervention. Examination of novel strategies addressing both pathological and pharmacological factors affecting outcome, employing novel trial design methods and utilizing biomarkers validated to be reflective of the prognosis for TBI will facilitate progress in overcoming the obstacles identified from previous clinical trials.</p><p>PMID: 22668124</p><h2 id=use-of-magnesium-in-traumatic-brain-injury>Use of magnesium in traumatic brain injury.</h2><p>Neurotherapeutics. 2010 Jan;7(1):91-9. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nurt.2009.10.014.>doi: 10.1016/j.nurt.2009.10.014.</a></p><p>Sen AP, Gulati A.</p><p>EndogenX, Los Gatos, California 95032, USA. <a href=mailto:asen@endogenx.com>asen@endogenx.com</a></p><p>Depletion of magnesium is observed in animal brain and in human blood after brain injury. Treatment with magnesium attenuates the pathological and behavioral changes in rats with brain injury; however, the <strong>therapeutic effect of magnesium has not been consistently observed in humans</strong> with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Secondary brain insults are observed in patients with brain injury, which adversely affect clinical outcome. Systemic administration studies in rats have shown that magnesium enters the brain; however, <strong>inducing hypermagnesemia in humans did not concomitantly increase magnesium levels in the CSF</strong> . We hypothesize that the neuroprotective effects of magnesium in TBI patients could be observed by increasing its brain bioavailability with <strong>mannitol</strong> . Here, we review the role of magnesium in brain injury, preclinical studies in brain injury, clinical safety and efficacy studies in TBI patients, brain bioavailability studies in rat, and pharmacokinetic studies in humans with brain injury. Neurodegeneration after brain injury involves multiple biochemical pathways. Treatment with a single agent has often resulted in poor efficacy at a safe dose or toxicity at a therapeutic dose. A successful neuroprotective therapy needs to be aimed at homeostatic control of these pathways with multiple agents. Other pharmacological agents, such as dexanabinol and progesterone, and physiological interventions, with hypothermia and hyperoxia, have been studied for the treatment of brain injury. Treatment with magnesium and hypothermia has shown favorable outcome in rats with cerebral ischemia. We conclude that coadministration of magnesium and mannitol with pharmacological and physiological agents could be an effective neuroprotective regimen for the treatment of TBI.</p><p>PMID: 20129501</p><h2 id=magnesium-in-acute-and-chronic-brain-injury-an-update>Magnesium in acute and chronic brain injury: an update.</h2><p>Magnes Res. 2009 Sep;22(3):158S-162S.</p><p>Vink R, Cook NL, van den Heuvel C.</p><p>Discipline of Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Australia. <a href=mailto:Robert.Vink@adelaide.edu.au>Robert.Vink@adelaide.edu.au</a></p><p><strong>While brain free magnesium levels have been shown to decline in a number of acute and chronic brain pathologies</strong> , the mechanisms of such decline and the potential for magnesium administration as a therapeutic intervention are still unclear. In acute brain injury, magnesium therapy has failed in recent clinical trials of trauma, presumably because of an intact blood brain barrier at the time of administration reducing central penetration. Under such conditions, magnesium&rsquo;s peripheral effects on cardiovascular parameters may dominate over the central, and potentially neuroprotective, effects of the compound. In contrast, magnesium has been demonstrated to be beneficial in lacunar strokes, albeit that recent animal studies indicate that this effect is without any significant reduction of lesion size. Postnatal magnesium has also been shown to improve neurological outcome in term neonates with perinatal asphyxia, although this may be limited to cases of mild to moderate brain injury; no effect is observed following severe brain injury. Prenatal magnesium has been reported to be beneficial for outcome in very preterm infants, although this may only be at low doses. Combination therapies are also showing promise in experimental studies, with combined magnesium and mild hypothermia as well as magnesium and polyethylene glycol proving effective in ischemic stroke and in spinal cord injury, respectively. With respect to chronic brain injury, recent results indicate that magnesium deficient mice are susceptible to developing Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, which is consistent with earlier findings that magnesium deficiency over a number of generations is associated with the development of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. The latter was associated with the appearance of variants of the TRPM channels. Our recent studies have shown that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is associated with reduced TRPM2 and TRPM7 channel mRNA expression. Taken together, a more complete picture is emerging of the role of magnesium in brain injury, its therapeutic potential as well the mechanisms associated with its decline.</p><p>PMID: 19780402</p><p><strong>PDF is at the bottom of this page</strong></p><h2 id=magnesium-for-acute-traumatic-brain-injury--cochrane--no>Magnesium for acute traumatic brain injury.

This study was designed to assess the relationship between initial serum magnesium, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) magnesium, neurological outcome and the efficacy of magnesium replacement therapy (MgSO4). A retrospective analysis was performed on a prospectively collected dataset from 216 patients admitted during 1996-2006 to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with severe TBI. Admission serum and CSF magnesium were dichotomized into low and normal magnesium concentration groups for serum and normal and high concentration groups for CSF. A logistic-regression analysis was performed with 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores as outcome variable. The outcome of a subset of 31 patients who presented with low serum magnesium and who were rapidly corrected within 24 h of admission was also analyzed. Low initial serum magnesium was measured in 56.67% of all patients. Patients with an initial serum magnesium of &lt;1.3 mEq/L were 2.37 times more likely to have a poor outcome (CI: 1.18-4.78, p = 0.016). The prognostic significance of depressed serum magnesium remained, even in patients whose serum magnesium levels were corrected within 24 h (OR = 11.03, CI: 1.87-68.14, p = 0.008). Patients with an initial high CSF magnesium were 7.63 more likely to have a poor outcome (p = 0.05). Elevated CSF magnesium correlated with depressed serum magnesium only in patients with poor outcome (p = 0.013). Patients with low serum magnesium and high CSF magnesium are most likely to have poor outcome after severe TBI. Rapid correction of serum magnesium levels does not reverse the prognostic value of these markers.</p><p>PMID: 17711396</p><h2 id=prolonged-elevation-of-magnesium-in-the-cerebrospinal-fluid-of-patients-with-severe-head-injury>Prolonged elevation of magnesium in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with severe head injury.</h2><p>Neurol Res. 2007 Dec;29(8):824-9.</p><p>Kafadar AM, Sanus GZ, Is M, Coskun A, Tanriverdi T, Hanimoglu H, Uzan M.</p><p>Department of Neurosurgery, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey. <a href=mailto:kafadar@istanbul.edu.tr>kafadar@istanbul.edu.tr</a></p><p>OBJECTIVES: Several works have investigated the role of serum magnesium (Mg) concentrations in traumatic brain injury.

The control group consisted of nine patients with hydrocephalus.</p><p>RESULTS: CSF levels of Mg were significantly higher in patients than controls in the corresponding time points except on days 5 and 10 of trauma. The CSF Mg levels tended to decrease and the highest level was found on day 1 after trauma (2.81 +/- 0.65 mg/dl). In the control group, the CSF level of Mg was 1.95 +/- 0.66 mg/dl. No significant difference can be detected between controls and patients regarding serum Mg and Ca levels. In addition, significantly higher values of Ca in the CSF were observed in all time points after trauma in patients with SHI than in the controls.

Supplemental magnesium positively affects many of the processes involved in secondary injury after traumatic brain injury and consistently improves outcome in animal models. We aimed to test whether treatment with magnesium favourably affects outcome in head-injured patients.</p><p>METHODS: In a double-blind trial, 499 patients aged 14 years or older admitted to a level 1 regional trauma centre between August, 1998, and October, 2004, with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury were randomly assigned one of two doses of magnesium or placebo within 8 h of injury and continuing for 5 days. Magnesium doses were targeted to achieve serum magnesium ranges of 1.0-1.85 mmol/L or 1.25-2.5 mmol/L. The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, seizures, functional measures, and neuropsychological tests assessed up to 6 months after injury. Analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered with , number .</p><p>FINDINGS: Magnesium showed no significant positive effect on the composite primary outcome measure at the higher dose (mean=55 average percentile ranking on magnesium vs 52 on placebo, 95% CI for difference -7 to 14; p=0.70). Those randomly assigned magnesium at the lower dose did significantly worse than those assigned placebo (48 vs 54, 95% CI -10.5 to -2; p=0.007). Furthermore, there was higher mortality with the higher magnesium dose than with placebo.

These alterations can be correlated with periods of postconcussion vulnerability and with neurobehavioral abnormalities.

Significant changes in cerebral glucose metabolism can exist even in head-injured patients with normal Glasgow Coma Scores, underscoring the need for in-depth clinical assessment in an effort to uncover neurocognitive correlates of altered cerebral physiology. Improved guidelines for clinical management of concussion may be formulated as the functional significance and duration of these postinjury neurometabolic derangements are better delineated.</p><p>PMID: 12937489</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/cascade-2001.jpg alt=image><p><strong>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</strong></p><h4 id=clipped-from-pdf>Clipped from PDF</h4><p><strong>Intracellular magnesium levels are also immediately reduced after TBI and remain low for up to 4 days</strong> .59–62</p><p>This reduction in magnesium has been correlated with postinjury neurologic deficits, and <strong>pretreatment</strong> to restore magnesium levels results in improved motor performance in experimental animals.63 Decreased magnesium levels may lead to neuronal dysfunction via multiple mechanisms.
