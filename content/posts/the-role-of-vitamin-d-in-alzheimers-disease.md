#### Is There a Role of Vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease?

CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets May 2023   [doi: 10.2174/1871527322666230526164421](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527322666230526164421) $95 paywall

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most prevalent type of neurodegenerative dementia and the sixth leading cause of death worldwide. The so-called "non-calcemic actions" of vitamin D have been increasingly described, and its insufficiency has already been linked to the onset and progression of the main neurological diseases, including AD.

* Immune-mediated Aβ plaque's phagocytosis and clearance, 

* immune response,

* oxidative stress, and 

* mitochondrial function 

are all influenced by vitamin D, and these functions are considered relevant in AD pathogenesis. 

However, it has been shown that the genomic vitamin D signaling pathway is already impaired in the AD brain, making things more complicated. In this paper, we aim to summarise the role of vitamin D in AD and review the results of the supplementation trials in AD patients.

Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) represents the most prevalent type of neurodegenerative dementia and the sixth leading cause of death worldwide. The so-called &quot;non-calcemic actions&quot; of vitamin D have been increasingly described, and its insufficiency has already been linked to the onset and progression of the main neurological diseases, including AD.
*Immune-mediated Aβ plaque&#39;s phagocytosis and clearance, 
*immune response,
*oxidative stress, and 
*mitochondrial function

However, it has been shown that the genomic vitamin D signaling pathway is already impaired in the AD brain, making things more complicated. In this paper, we aim to summarise the role of vitamin D in AD and review the results of the supplementation trials in AD patients.
