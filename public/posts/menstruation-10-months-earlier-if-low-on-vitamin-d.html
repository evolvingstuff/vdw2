The association was not fully explained by differences in body mass index-for-age z-scores. The mechanism for the association, if real, has not been elucidated, but <strong>could potentially involve vitamin D receptor polymorphisms</strong> . Early menarche and vitamin D deficiency are both associated with poor health outcomes, and further exploration of their association is important for women&rsquo;s health.</p><p>PMID: 23452286</p><p><strong><a href=http://nutritionreviews.oxfordjournals.org/content/71/3/189>Publisher wants $39 for the PDF</a></strong></p><hr><p><a href=http://www.emaxhealth.com/1275/low-vitamin-d-levels-and-early-menstruation-linked>http://www.emaxhealth.com/1275/low-vitamin-d-levels-and-early-menstruation-linked</a></p><p>Early menstruation, which is a risk factor for psychosocial and behavioral problems in teens and diseases such as breast cancer in later life, appears to be linked to low levels of vitamin D. The study’s results could have important implications for young girls around the world.</p><p>The age of first menstruation has been declining</p><p>In 1901, a report at the proceedings of the 26th meeting of the American Gynecological Society reported that the mean age of first menstruation (menarche) for girls in the United States and Canada was 13.9 or 14 years. Subsequent research reported that the age of menarche has declined to 12.5 years between 1965 and 1985.</p><p>According to one of the authors of the new study, Eduardo Villamor, associate professor in the University of Michigan School of Public Health, the age of menarche has been undergoing a slow decline worldwide for years. He suggests there is an environmental cause behind the decline, because the genetics of puberty have not changed.</p><p>One of those environmental causes may be low levels of vitamin D. To investigate this idea, a research team measured the blood levels of vitamin D in 242 girls ages 5 to 12 from Bogota, Colombia. All the girls were followed for 30 months.</p><p>The investigators found that 57 percent of girls who had low vitamin D levels started menstruation during the study period compared with 23 percent of girls who had sufficient vitamin D levels. Girls who had low vitamin D levels started menarche at about 11.8 years of age, while girls with sufficient vitamin D levels started menstruation at about 12.6 years of age.</p><p>Villamor noted that researchers know little about environmental triggers for puberty. “If we learn what is causing the decline in age of first menstruation,” he said, “we may be able to develop interventions” to prevent girls from experiencing premature menarche.</p><p>In another recent study, published in Environmental Research, investigators in Taiwan found that women who were exposed to environmental toxins such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at age 5 to 9 years started menarche “slightly earlier with borderline significance.” In Reproductive Toxicology, researchers reported they found an association between exposure to DES and early menarche.</p><p>The study by Villamor and colleagues is important because it points out a possible link between low vitamin D levels and early menstruation, although it did not establish insufficient vitamin D as a cause of premature menarche. Additional studies are needed to determine if changing girls’ vitamin D levels will cause a change in age of menarche.</p><p>SOURCES:</p><p>Hatch EE et al.

Latitude, which influences sun exposure, is inversely related to age at menarche. This association might be related to vitamin D, but to our knowledge it has not been investigated in prospective epidemiologic studies.</p><p>Objective: We studied the association between vitamin D status and the occurrence of menarche in a prospective study in girls from Bogota, Colombia.</p><p>Design: We measured plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations in a random sample of 242 girls (mean ± SD age: 8.8 ± 1.6 y) and followed them for a median of 30 mo. Girls were asked periodically about the occurrence and date of menarche. Baseline 25(OH)D concentrations were categorized as &lt;50 nmol/L (deficient), ?50 and &lt;75 nmol/L, or ?75 nmol/L (sufficient). The incidence of menarche was compared between groups by using time-to-event analyses.</p><p>Results: A total of 57% of girls in the vitamin D–deficient group reached menarche during follow-up compared with 23% of girls in the vitamin D–sufficient group (P-trend = 0.0004). The estimated mean (±SE) ages at menarche in the same groups were 11.8 ± 0.2 y and 12.6 ± 0.2 y, respectively (P = 0.0009). After adjustment for baseline age and BMI-for-age z score in a Cox proportional hazards model, the probability of menarche was twice as high in vitamin D–deficient girls than in girls who were vitamin D–sufficient (HR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.07; P = 0.04). Similar results were obtained in girls aged ?9 y at baseline (HR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.14, 5.00; P = 0.02).</p><p>Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with earlier menarche.</p><p><strong><a href="http://ns.umich.edu/htdocs/releases/story.php?id=8506">3 minute Video by the author</a></strong></p><hr><h2 id=see-also-web>See also web</h2><p><a href=http://blogs.babycenter.com/mom_stories/8-15-2011low-vitamin-d-triggers-early-puberty-in-girls/>Low vitamin D triggers early puberty in girls?</a> Aug 2011</p><p><a href=http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/06/low-level-of-this-vitamin-found-to-be-linked-to-early-menstruation.aspx>Mercola discussion of the above study</a></p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/puberty-before-age-10-a-new-normal.html?_r=1">Puberty Before Age 10: A New ‘Normal’?</a> New York Times Mar 2012</p><p>   Discusses ideas about &ldquo;bone age&rdquo; and amount of fat, but does not mention vitamin D</p><p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/girls-hitting-puberty-early-age-study-suggests/story?id=11345321&amp;page=2#.T3ZAPqtSS8A">Is Puberty in Girls Coming Too Soon?</a> ABC News Aug 2010</p><p>   Referring to a 1997 study: 9.7 years old for Caucasian girls and 8.1 years old for African-American girls.
