1 Endocrinology and Nutrition Departement, National Nutrition Institute, Tunis, Tunisia; 

2 Neuroradiology Department, National Neurology Institute, Tunis, Tunisia.

Background: The vitamin D is a pleiotropic hormone that plays a significant role on global health. However, vitamin D status in acromegaly has been poorly studied.

The aim: The aim of this study was to assess the vitamin D status in acromegaly and compare it to a control group. Then to analyse bone remodeling and density markers based on the vitamin D levels.

Methods: We conducted an evaluative cross sectional study in the Department of Endocrinology at the National Institute of Nutrition in Tunis comparing 2 groups of 25 acromegalic patients and 25 control subjects (age and sex matched).

Results: The average age was 50±14.52 years <span>[16–52]</span>. The sex ratio was 9/16 (36% men and 64% women). The mean duration of the acromegaly was 8.6±9.62 years. As for acromegalic repercussions patients presented with rheumatologic impacts in 80% of the cases, visual in 72%, respiratory in 68%, pituitary in 56%, metabolic in 56% and tumoral in 8%. Twenty-one subjects underwent surgical treatement, 24% were under somatostatin analogs, two patients had received radiotherapy. Acromegaly was active in 64% of the cases, controlled for 4 patients and cured for 5 (20%). The vitamin D status was similar between the acromegalic group and the control subjects: Thirteen acromegalic patients had deficiency, 9 (36%) had insufficiency and 3 patients (12%) had a normal level of vitamin D. The univariate study showed that, duration of sun exposure, exposed surface, score screening for vitamin D insufficiency, height, PTH, and GH were significantly associated with the vitamin D level in acromegalics.

Conclusion:  **The exploration of the vitamin D status in acromegaly should become a common practice** . The management starts with the prevention of the defict, the screening and eventually a therapeutic supplementation.

#### Investigation of the Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphisms in Acromegaly Patients - March 2015 (50%)

Objective. The genetic structural alterations in the majority of somatotroph adenomas are not clarified and the search for novel candidate genes is still a challenge. We aimed to investigate possible associations between vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and acromegaly. 

Design, Patients, and Methods. 52 acromegaly patients (mean age 46  years) and 83 controls (mean age 47 years) were recruited to the study. VDR polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. 

Results. The distribution of VDR genotypes showed a significant difference in the frequencies of VDR FokI genotypes between patients and controls (P =0.034). VDR FokI ff genotype was significantly decreased in acromegaly patients (P = 0.035) and carriers of FokI Ff genotype had a  **1.5-fold increased risk for acromegaly**  (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.07–2.1; ). IGF1 levels after treatment were significantly higher in patients carrying the Ff genotype compared to carrying ff genotype (P=0.0049). 25(OH)D3 levels were significantly lower in acromegaly patients (P=0.0001). 

Conclusions. Our study suggests that VDR FokI genotypes might affect the development of acromegaly and VDR polymorphisms may play a role in the course of acromegaly as a consequence of altering hormonal status.

#### IGF-1 increases if take > 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily - meta-analysis Dec 2019

 **The influence of vitamin D supplementation on IGF-1 levels in humans: A systematic review and meta-analysis.** 

Ageing Res Rev. 2019 Dec 6:100996. [doi: 10.1016/j.arr.2019.100996.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2019.100996.)

BACKGROUND:

Inconsistencies exist with regard to influence of vitamin D supplementation on IGF-1 levels. The inconsistencies could be attributed to several factors, such as dosage and duration of intervention, among others. To address these inconsistencies, this study was conducted to determine the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IGF-1 levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

METHODS:

A comprehensive systematic search was carried out in PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, SCOPUS and Embase for RCTs that investigated the impact of vitamin D intake on circulating IGF-1 levels from inception until June 2019. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with the 95% CI were applied for estimating combined effect size. Subgroup analysis was performed to specify the source of heterogeneity among studies.

RESULTS:

Pooled results from eight studies demonstrated an overall non-significant increase in IGF-1 following vitamin D supplementation (WMD: 4 ng/ml, 95% CI: -4 to 11). However, a significant degree of heterogeneity among studies was observed (I2 = 66%).

 **The subgroup analyses showed that vitamin D dosage of ≤1000 IU/day (WMD: 10 ng/ml)** significantly increased IGF-1 compared to the vitamin D dosage of <1000 IU/day (WMD: -1 ng/ml). Moreover, intervention duration ≤12 weeks (WMD: 11 ng/ml) significantly increased IGF-1 compared to intervention duration <12 weeks (WMD: -3 ng/ml). In the epidemiological cohort study, participants under 60 years of age with a higher dietary vitamin D intake had significantly higher IGF-1 levels when compared to those with lower dietary vitamin D intake in second categories.

CONCLUSION:

The main results indicate a non-significant increase in IGF-1 following vitamin D supplementation. 

Additionally, vitamin D dosages of <1000 IU/day and intervention durations of <12 weeks significantly raised IGF-1 levels.

#### Vitamin D-binding protein and free vitamin D concentrations in acromegaly - Nov 2015

Alev Eroglu Altinova, Cigdem Ozkan cozkan34@hotmail.com , Mujde Akturk, Ozlem Gulbahar, Muhittin Yalcin, Nuri Cakir, Fusun Balos Toruner

Free 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> is suggested to be important in the determination of vitamin D deficiency, since vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) may affect total 25(OH)D levels. There are no data about free 25(OH)D concentrations in acromegaly. We aimed to investigate serum VDBP and total and free 25(OH)D levels in patients with acromegaly in comparison with control subjects. We recruited 54 patients with acromegaly and 32 control subjects who were similar according to age, gender, and body mass index. Serum VDBP levels were found to be increased in patients with acromegaly compared to control subjects [90.35 (72.45–111.10) vs. 69.52 (63.89–80.13) mg/l, p = 0.001](90.35%20(72.45–111.10)%20vs.%2069.52%20(63.89–80.13)%20mg/l,%20p%20=%200.001). There was statistically no significant difference in serum total 25(OH)D levels between the patients with acromegaly and control subjects [18.63 (13.35–27.73) vs. 22.51 (19.20–28.96) ng/ml, p = 0.05](18.63%20(13.35–27.73)%20vs.%2022.51%20(19.20–28.96)%20ng/ml,%20p%20=%200.05). Free 25(OH)D levels were significantly decreased in patients with acromegaly compared to control subjects [14.55 (10.45–21.45) vs. 17.75 (15.30–23.75) pg/ml, p = 0.03](14.55%20(10.45–21.45)%20vs.%2017.75%20(15.30–23.75)%20pg/ml,%20p%20=%200.03). Free 25(OH)D levels correlated positively with total 25(OH)D (p = 0.0001) and HDL cholesterol (p = 0.04) and negatively with fasting blood glucose (p = 0.04). Our findings indicate that VDBP is increased and free 25(OH)D is decreased in acromegaly, while there is no significant alteration in total 25(OH)D.
