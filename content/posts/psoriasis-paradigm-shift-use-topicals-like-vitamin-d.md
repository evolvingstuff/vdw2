[Topical Vitamin D](/posts/topical-vitamin-d) works great for many skin problems, not just psoriasis. Vitamin D oil or nanoemulsion (2,000 IU per drop), and Vitamin D Aloe Cream (10,000 IU per pump) both work within days**

Psoriasis (PsO) requires safe and effective long-term management to reduce the risk of recurrence and decrease the frequency of relapse. Topical PsO therapies are a cornerstone in the management of PsO though safety concerns limit the chronic, continuous use of topical corticosteroids and/or vitamin D3 analogues. 

Evidence-based guidelines on optimal treatment targets and maintenance therapy regimens are currently lacking. This review explores the evidence supporting approaches to maintenance topical therapy for PsO including

* continuous long-term therapy, 

* chronic intermittent use, 

* step-down therapy, 

* sequential or pulse therapy regimens, and 

* proactive maintenance therapy. 

Several unaddressed questions are discussed including how and when to transition from acute to maintenance therapy, strategies for monitoring long-term treatment, the role of topical maintenance therapy in the context of systemic and biologic therapies, risks of maintenance therapy, prescribing a topical preparation suitable for patients' preferences and skin type, and key concepts for patient education to maximize long-term outcomes. 

Overall, emerging evidence supports a paradigm shift towards proactive treatment once skin is completely clear as a strategy to enhance disease control without compromising safety.
