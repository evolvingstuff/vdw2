#### ~~#00F:Unfortunately, the Spanish study did not report how much Vitamin D some COVID-19 patients had been taking

 **Those taking Vitamin D had fewer health problems**

 **Those with Vitamin D had much higher levels of vitamin D**

 **Comment by VitaminDWiki** 

1. Many people taking a lot of Vitamin D did not get any COVID-19 infection

1. People taking less Vitamin D got COVID-19, but did not have to go to the hospital

1. People taking a small amount of Vitamin D entered the hospital, and were reported in this study

#### VITAMIN D STATUS IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION

Background: The role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients is a matter of debate.

Objectives: To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to analyze the possible influence of vitamin D status on disease severity.

Methods: Retrospective case-control study of 216 COVID-19 patients and 197 population-based controls.

Serum 25OHD levels were measured in both groups. Besi COVID-19 severity (admission to the Intensive Care Unit, re was also evaluated.

Results: Of the 216 patients, 19 were on vitamin D s patients, mean±SD25〇Hd levels were 13.8±7.2ng/ml，compared to 20.9±7.4ng/ml in controls (p<0.0001). 25OHD values were lower in men than in women. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (p<0.0001). 25OHD inversely correlate to serum ferritin (p=0.013) and D-dimer levels (p=0.027). Vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients had a greater prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, raised serum ferritin and troponin levels, as well as a longer length of hospital stay than those with serum 25OHD levels >20 ng/ml. No causal relationship was found between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity as a combined endpoint or as its separate components.

Conclusions: 25OHD levels are lower in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to population-based controls and these patients had a higher prevalence of deficiency. We did not find any relationship between vitamin D concentrations or vitamin deficiency and the severity of the disease.

#### Many clinical trials are underway which are testing Vitamin D to fight COVID-19
