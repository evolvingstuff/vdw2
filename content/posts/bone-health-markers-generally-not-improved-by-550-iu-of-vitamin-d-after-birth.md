25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) may influence bone turnover. We compared the dynamics of bone markers in 30 infants on vitamin D supplementation (?550IU/d) with different degrees of hypovitaminosis D (25OHD <11ng/ml - deficiency vs. ?11<20ng/ml - insufficiency). Baseline and follow-up (after 10 weeks), 25OHD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), PTH, osteocalcin (OC), N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP), C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), amino-terminal propeptide of C-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proCNP) were measured. None of the newborns had craniotabes, hypocalcaemia or hyperparathyroidism. 

The median (Q1;Q3) 25OHD increased from a baseline of 8.45 (7;11.9) ng/ml to 54.6 (34.7;67.3) ng/ml (p<0.001). 

The baseline 25OHD negatively correlated with total increment of 25OHD (r=-0.54; p=0.002). There were changes in ALP (241 vs. 331IU; p<0.001), 1,25(OH)(2)D (48 vs. 95.5pg/ml, p<0.001), OC (88.8 vs. 159.1ng/ml, p<0.001), PINP (3886 vs. 2409ng/ml; p<0.001), CTX (1.6 vs. 1.1ng/ml; p<0.001), NT-proCNP (75.1 vs. 35.1pmol/l; p<0.001). 

Vitamin D deficient infants at baseline, compared to the insufficient group, revealed significantly higher percentage changes for 25OHD (745% vs. 167%, p<0.0001), OC (113% vs. 40%, p<0.05) and 1,25(OH)(2)D (95% vs. 58%, p<0.05). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplements had little to no impact on markers of bone turnover in term infants in the first few months of life,  **with the exception of osteocalcin** . 

Ten weeks of cholecalciferol supplementation at a dose of  **550 IU/d**  led to a marked increase of 25OHD concentration. The magnitude of 25OHD increment was inversely related to vitamin D status at baseline. Irrespective of the severity of vitamin D deficiency, a secondary hyperparathyroidism with elevated iPTH, ALP, phosphaturia or hypophosphatemia was not observed in the studied neonates.

### Summary: 550 IU of vitamin D for 10 weeks

* Average 8.5 ng ==> 55 ng (6.9 x)

* Deficient: 7 ng ==> 35 ng ( 5 x) 

* Insufficient: 12 ng ==>67 ng (5.6 X)

### No indication of amounts of bone cofactors

* Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin K2, etc.

### The Deficient infants probably were still increasing vitamin D levels at 10 weeks (had not stabilized)
