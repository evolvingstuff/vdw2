Background: Vitamin D compounds inhibit prostate tumorigenesis experimentally, but epidemiologic data are inconsistent with respect to prostate cancer risk, with some studies suggesting nonsignificant positive associations.

Methods: The 25-hydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>–prostate cancer relation was examined in a nested case–control study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of 50- to 69-year-old Finnish men. We matched 1,000 controls to 1,000 cases diagnosed during up to 20 years of follow-up on the basis of age (±1 year) and fasting blood collection date (±30 days). Conditional multivariate logistic regression models estimated ORs and 95% CIs. All statistical significance testing was 2-sided.

Results: Cases had nonsignificantly 3% higher serum 25(OH)D levels (P = 0.19). ORs (95% CIs) for increasing season-specific quintiles of 25(OH)D concentrations were 1.00 (reference), 1.29 (0.95–1.74), 1.34 (1.00–1.80), 1.26 (0.93–1.72), and 1.56 (1.15–2.12), with Ptrend = 0.01. Analyses based on prespecified clinical categories and season-adjusted values yielded similar results. 

These findings seemed stronger for 

* aggressive disease <span>[OR (95% CI) for fifth quintile of serum 25(OH)D [1.70 (1.05–2.76), Ptrend = 0.02]</span>, 

* among men with greater physical activity <span>[1.85 (1.26–2.72), Ptrend = 0.002]</span>, 

* higher concentrations of serum total cholesterol <span>[2.09 (1.36–3.21), Ptrend = 0.003]</span> or 

* (higher concentrations of) ?-tocopherol <span>[2.00 (1.30–3.07), Ptrend = 0.01]</span> and 

* higher intakes of total calcium <span>[1.82 (1.20–2.76), Ptrend = 0.01]</span> or 

* (higher intakes of) vitamin D <span>[1.69 (1.04–2.75), Ptrend = 0.08]</span>, or 

* among those who had received the trial ?-tocopherol supplements <span>[1.74 (1.15–2.64), Ptrend = 0.006]</span>.

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that men with  **higher vitamin D blood levels are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer** .

Impact: Greater caution is warranted with respect to recommendations for high-dose vitamin D supplementation and higher population target blood levels.

Suspect the vitamin D levels were high due to the Fins taking Cod Liver oil, which has large amounts of <a href="/posts/vitamin-a-which-blocks-the-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1475">Vitamin A which blocks the Vitamin D</a>
