Increased metabolic profiles during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and remain a significant medical challenge. To our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of calcium-vitamin D supplementation on metabolic profiles among pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia. This study was designed to determine the effects of consumption calcium-vitamin D supplements on metabolic profiles among Iranian pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia. 

This randomized single-blind controlled clinical trial was performed among 49 pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia, primigravida, aged 18-35 year old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. 

Subjects were randomly assigned to consume the placebo (n = 25) or calcium-vitamin D supplements (n = 24) for 9 weeks. Calcium-vitamin D supplements were containing 500 mg carbonate calcium plus  **200 IU vitamin D3** . Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9 week intervention to measures of Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) and serum lipid profiles. Consumption of calcium-vitamin D supplements resulted in decreased FPG and serum triglycerides levels as compared to the placebo (-9.1 vs. 0.5 mg dL-1; p = 0.03, -11.7 vs. 49.9 mg dL-1; p = 0.001, respectively). 

No significant differences were found comparing calcium-vitamin D supplements and the placebo in terms of their effect on serum total-, HDL-, LDL-cholesterol levels. Within-group differences in the placebo group revealed a significant increase in serum triglycerides levels (+49.9 mg dL-1, p<0.0001). 

In conclusion, consumption of calcium-vitamin D supplements for 9 weeks during pregnancy among pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia resulted in decreased FPG and serum triglycerides levels as compared to the placebo group, but could not affect serum total-, HDL-, LDL-cholesterol levels.
