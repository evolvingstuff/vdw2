#### Risk factors for multiple sclerosis in the context of Epstein-Barr virus infection

Front Immunol. 2023 Jul 24;14:1212676. [doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1212676](https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1212676)

 **Combined Risk Factors for MS** 

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="350">

Compelling evidence indicates that Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection is a prerequisite for multiple sclerosis (MS). The disease may arise from a complex interplay between latent EBV infection, genetic predisposition, and various environmental and lifestyle factors that negatively affect immune control of the infection. Evidence of gene-environment interactions and epigenetic modifications triggered by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals supports this view. This review gives a short introduction to EBV and host immunity and discusses evidence indicating EBV as a prerequisite for MS. The role of genetic and environmental risk factors, and their interactions, in MS pathogenesis is reviewed and put in the context of EBV infection. Finally, possible preventive measures are discussed based on the findings presented.
