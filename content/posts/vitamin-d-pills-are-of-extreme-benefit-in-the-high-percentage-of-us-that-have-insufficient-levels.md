### From  [Vitamin D Newsletter - Robert Baker MD](http://robertbakermdhealthnewsletter.blogspot.com/)

This is the type of headline that the public should see.  That is why I am posting it. 

Because most of us don't live near the equator (where life on earth is believed to have started), we cover up most of our skin most of the time when outdoors, and because of other factors, a high percentage of humans have insufficient levels.  The evidence of this is MASSIVE and CONCLUSIVE.. Some of the evidence is posted on various entries to this Newsletter.
