#### [Vitamin D3 Supplementation Has No Impact on Breast Density Percentage, Breast Cancer Risk](http://www.oncologynurseadvisor.com/breast-cancer/vitamin-d3-consumption-may-not-lower-breast-cancer-risk/article/675548/) Oncology Nurse

 **Reporting on:** 

Brisson J, Berube S, Diorio C, et al. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on breast density in premenopausal women <span>[published online July 14, 2017]</span>. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev.

The study only lasted 1 year, and the vitamin D levels probably not peaked for 3 months.

9 months is not nearly long enough to notice a change in Breast Cancer rates
