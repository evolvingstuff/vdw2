## Graph of Predicted vs. observed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.

#### serum vitamin D ng/ ml in blood =  (427.46(1+pigmentation grade)*10**-2 +(dose IU/day)*10**-2)/Body massindex,

#### that is: (430 * square root of (1+pigmentation grade) + square root of IU)/ Body massindex

### pigmentation grade: 2 = light, 1= intermediate, 0 = dark),

### body mass index = (weight lbs)(703)/(height inches)**2

* Equation does not consider other factors which will change change the response: 

   * medical problems,  supplements, vitamin A,  latitude, smoking, how much get from the sun (time in the sun, age, ...__

* [Click here for Smoking decrease vitamin D](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Smoking+Decreases+vitamin+D%2C+what+about+smoking+during+pregnancy%3F)

* Equation appears to generally predict response correctly to within +-50%

* Equation is based on data from 15-40 ng - doubt that this equation is correct for 60 ng

## Unhealthy people need even more vitamin D

## And - the blood levels vary by 4X between individuals.
