#### For Flavonoid Benefits, Don’t Peel Apples - Dr. Greger July 2023

 **[For Flavonoid Benefits, Don’t Peel Apples](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/friday-favorites-for-flavonoid-benefits-dont-peel-apples/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&utm_campaign=546bbf04fb-RSS_VIDEO_MONTHLY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-546bbf04fb-25209481&mc_cid=546bbf04fb&mc_eid=b95641625a) YouTube**

* "Even a fraction of an apple a day is associated with 24 percent lower odds of having severe major artery calcifications, a marker of vascular disease."

* Test of peeled vs unpeeled apples..."flavonoid levels in the bloodstream shot up in the unpeeled apple group, compared to the peeled apple group, which coincided with significantly improved artery function— peeled versus unpeeled. They conclude that the lower risk of cardiovascular disease with higher apple consumption is most likely due to the high concentration of ﬂavonoids in the skin, which improve artery function, though it could be anything in the peel. All we know is that apple peels are particularly good for us, improving artery function and lowering blood pressure"

  *  **Abstract:** Apples contain substantial amounts of polyphenols, and diverse phenolics mainly flavonoids and phenolic acids, have been identified in their flesh and skins. This work aimed to analyze the overall landscape of the research literature published to date on apple phenolic compounds in the context of human and animal health. The Web of Science Core Collection electronic database was queried with (apple* polyphenol*) AND (health* OR illness* OR disease* OR medic* OR pharma*) to identify relevant papers covering these words and their derivatives in the titles, abstracts, and keywords. The resulted 890 papers were bibliometrically analyzed. The VOSviewer software was utilized to produce term maps that illustrate how the frequent phrases fared in terms of publication and citation data. The apple polyphenol papers received global contributions, particularly from China, Italy, the United States, Spain, and Germany. Examples of frequently mentioned chemicals/chemical classes are  **quercetin** , anthocyanin, catechin, epicatechin, and flavonol, while examples of frequently mentioned medical conditions are cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and obesity. The potential health benefits of apple polyphenols on humans and animals are diverse and warrant further study.

!!!!For Flavonoid Benefits, Don’t Peel Apples - Dr. Greger July 2023

*&quot;Even a fraction of an apple a day is associated with 24 percent lower odds of having severe major artery calcifications, a marker of vascular disease.&quot;
*Test of peeled vs unpeeled apples...&quot;flavonoid levels in the bloodstream shot up in the unpeeled apple group, compared to the peeled apple group, which coincided with significantly improved artery function— peeled versus unpeeled. They conclude that the lower risk of cardiovascular disease with higher apple consumption is most likely due to the high concentration of ﬂavonoids in the skin, which improve artery function, though it could be anything in the peel. All we know is that apple peels are particularly good for us, improving artery function and lowering blood pressure&quot;

This work aimed to analyze the overall landscape of the research literature published to date on apple phenolic compounds in the context of human and animal health. The Web of Science Core Collection electronic database was queried with (apple* polyphenol*) AND (health* OR illness* OR disease* OR medic* OR pharma*) to identify relevant papers covering these words and their derivatives in the titles, abstracts, and keywords. The resulted 890 papers were bibliometrically analyzed. The VOSviewer software was utilized to produce term maps that illustrate how the frequent phrases fared in terms of publication and citation data. The apple polyphenol papers received global contributions, particularly from China, Italy, the United States, Spain, and Germany. Examples of frequently mentioned chemicals/chemical classes are __quercetin__, anthocyanin, catechin, epicatechin, and flavonol, while examples of frequently mentioned medical conditions are cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and obesity. The potential health benefits of apple polyphenols on humans and animals are diverse and warrant further study.
