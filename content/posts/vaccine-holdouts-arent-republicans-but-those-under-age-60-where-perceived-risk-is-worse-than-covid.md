#### America's biggest vaccine holdouts aren't Republicans - they're young people who think COVID only poses a risk to the elderly, new data analysis finds

 **[DailyMail Dec 23](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10340001/Americas-vaccine-holdouts-arent-Republicans-theyre-people-65.html)** 

* Lehigh University professor Anthony  **DiMaggio**  says despite reports blaming Republicans for holding out on vaccines, partisanship isn't the biggest factor 

* This contradicts comments from some Democratic leaders and political pundits 

* Instead, DiMaggio said vaccine hesitancy is divided by age, with those younger than 65 less likely to get the jab than their elderly counterparts

* Although politics does play somewhat into a person's decision-making on vaccines, it's not the most telling consideration, DiMaggio's research found

* He said the analysis suggests younger Americans have 'discounted the dangers of COVID-19, viewing it as something that only threatens the elderly'

*  **Mayo Clinic vaccination data** backs his assertion; it shows a plunge in percentage points for each age group below 65
