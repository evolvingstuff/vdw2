BACKGROUND: To study and update the provincial incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), a province of Canada with a very high incidence previously reported in 2006, and one of the highest incidences reported worldwide. This is a retrospective time trend study of the incidence of T1DM, in children aged 0 -14 years from 1987 -2010 inclusive.

FINDINGS:

Over the study period 931 children aged 0--14 years were diagnosed with T1DM. 

The incidence of T1DM in this population over the period 1987 - 2010 inclusive was 37.7 per 100,000 per year (95% CI 35. 3, 40.2)

The incidence from 2007 -2010 was 49.9 per 100,000 per year (95% CI 42.2, 57.6). 

The incidence over this 24 year period increased by a factor of 1.03 per 100,000 per year.

CONCLUSION:

NL has one of the highest incidences of T1DM reported worldwide. Potential reasons for the very high incidence could be related to the 

* unique genetic background of the population, 

*  **northern latitude and vitamin D insufficiency** , 

* low breastfeeding rates, and 

* high rates of cesarean section.
