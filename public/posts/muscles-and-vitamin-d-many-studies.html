Muscle strength gains (p &lt; 0.001) as measured in seven exercises performed on RT equipment and increases (p &lt; 0.001) in LBM were similar in the two groups. Total fat mass, percent total fat, and percent android fat decreased (p &lt; 0.05) to a similar extent in both groups, but there was no change in VO2max in either group.</p><p>Conclusions: In conclusion, in healthy Vit-D-insufficient middle-aged men engaged in resistance training, Vit-D supplementation increases serum 25(OH)D levels but does not enhance gains in muscle strength and LBM, or decreases in fat mass and fat percentage, and does not affect cardiorespiratory fitness.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/max-strength-8000-iu.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=surplus-calories-not-put-into-fat-if-good-level-of-vitamin-d-mice-may-2024>Surplus calories not put into fat if good level of Vitamin D (mice) May 2024</h4><p><strong>High dose dietary vitamin D allocates surplus calories to muscle and growth instead of fat via modulation of myostatin and leptin signaling</strong></p><p>Preprint DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-4202165/v1</p><p>Jeffrey David Roizen Jeffrey David Roizen Caela Long Caela Long Alex Casella Alex Casella Show all 8 authors Julian Mark</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/high-d.webp alt=image width=700>
<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/high-dose-muscle.webp alt=image width=700><p>Obesity occurs because the body stores surplus calories as fat rather than as muscle. Fat secretes a hormone, leptin, that modulates energy balance at the brain. Changes in fat mass are mirrored by changes in serum leptin. Elevated leptin prompts the brain to decrease appetite and increase energy expenditure. In obesity, however, impaired leptin sensitivity mutes these leptin-mediated changes. We have limited understanding of what controls leptin production by fat or leptin sensitivity in the brain. Muscle produces a hormone, myostatin, that plays a role in muscle analogous to the one that leptin plays in fat. Absent myostatin leads to increased muscle mass and strength. As with leptin, we also do not know what controls myostatin production or sensitivity. Although fat mass and muscle mass are closely linked, the interplay between leptin and myostatin remains obscure. Here we describe an interplay linked thru vitamin D. Conventionally, it is thought that vitamin D improves strength via trophic effects at the muscle. However, we find here that high dose dietary vitamin D allocates excess calories to muscle and linear growth instead of storage as fat. Vitamin D mediates this allocation by decreasing myostatin production and increasing leptin production and sensitivity. That is, high dose vitamin D improves integration of organismal energy balance. Obesity, aging and other chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased fat mass and decreased muscle mass and function (e.g. sarcopenia). Our work provides a physiologic framework for how high-dose vitamin D would increase allocation of calories to muscle instead of fat in these pathologies. Additionally, our work reveals a novel link between the myostatin and leptin signaling whereby myostatin conveys energy needs to modulate leptin effects on calorie allocation. This result provides evidence to update the conventional model of energy stores sensing to a new model of energy balance sensing. In our proposed model, integration of leptin and myostatin signaling allows control of body composition independent of weight. Furthermore, our work reveals how physiologic seasonal variation in vitamin D may be important in controlling season-specific metabolism and calorie allocation to fat in winter and muscle and growth in summer.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/high-dose-d-compresspdf.pdf>Preprint PDF</a></strong></p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><ul><li><p>High-D = 10,000 IU/kg of food resulted in >30ng/mL of blood</p></li><li><p>High-D increased lean mass and decreased fat mass relative to normal-D without altering weight</p></li><li><p>The lack of white fat in VDR knockout mice causes them to have persistently low leptin</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=do-fast-twitch-muscles-respond-more-quickly-if-there-is-a-higher-level-of-vitamin-d-in-the-blood>Do fast twitch muscles respond more quickly if there is a higher level of vitamin D in the blood?</h4><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/do-fast-twitch-XUR0TFYrQQCuTZkPcdRwiQ>Asked Perplexity AI June 2024</a></strong> click to see 5 references</p><p>Yes, higher levels of vitamin D in the blood are associated with improved function and development of fast-twitch (type II) muscle fibers, which are responsible for quick, powerful movements.</p><p>Vitamin D appears to have a specific effect on fast-twitch muscle fibers in several ways:</p><ol><li><p>It induces hypertrophy (growth) of type II muscle fibers, increasing their size and number.</p></li><li><p>It enhances the differentiation and development of type II muscle fiber cells.</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D deficiency leads to preferential atrophy (wasting) of type II muscle fibers over slow-twitch fibers.</p></li><li><p>Supplementing with vitamin D increases the percentage and cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers.</p></li><li><p>Higher vitamin D levels are associated with improved muscle power, force, velocity and performance in activities requiring fast-twitch fibers like jumping.</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D supplementation in deficient individuals improves muscle strength and athletic performance measures that rely heavily on fast-twitch fibers, such as sprint speed and vertical jump.</p></li></ol><p>So in summary, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels appears crucial for optimizing the size, function and recruitment of the fast-twitch muscle fibers that allow for rapid, powerful contractions during athletic activities.

Muscle regeneration is a vital process that allows for skeletal muscle tissue maintenance and repair after injury. PubMed and Web of Science were used to search for studies published prior to May 2023. We assessed eligible studies that discussed the relationship between vitamin D, muscle regeneration in this review. Overall, the literature reports strong associations between vitamin D and skeletal myocyte size, and muscle regeneration. In vitro studies in skeletal muscle cells derived from mice and humans showed vitamin D played a role in regulating myoblast growth, size, and gene expression. Animal studies, primarily in mice, demonstrate vitamin D’s positive effects on skeletal muscle function, such as improved grip strength and endurance. These studies encompass vitamin D diet research, genetically modified models, and disease-related mouse models. Relatively few studies looked at muscle function after injury, but these also support a role for vitamin D in muscle recovery.</p><p>The human studies have also reported that vitamin D deficiency decreases muscle grip strength and gait speed, especially in the elderly population.</p><p>Finally, human studies reported the benefits of vitamin D supplementation and achieving optimal serum vitamin D levels in muscle recovery after eccentric exercise and surgery.</p><p>However, there were no benefits in rotator cuff injury studies, suggesting that repair mechanisms for muscle/ligament tears may be less reliant on vitamin D.</p><p>In summary, vitamin D plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle function, structural integrity, and regeneration, potentially offering therapeutic benefits to patients with musculoskeletal diseases and in post-operative recovery.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/muscle-review-oct-2023-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=muscle-health-and-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-sept-2021-not-help-much---ignored-dose-size>Muscle Health and Vitamin D - Meta-analysis Sept 2021 (not help much - ignored dose size)</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D and Muscle Health: A Systematic Review and Meta‐analysis of Randomized Placebo‐Controlled Trials</strong></p><p>Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, Vol 36, Issue 9, Pages 1651–1660, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.4412>https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.4412</a></p><p>Lise Sofie Bislev, Diana Grove‐Laugesen, Lars Rejnmark</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo on muscle health.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in muscle, as is CYP27B1, the enzyme that hydroxylates 25(OH)D to its active form, 1,25(OH)D. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that vitamin D may play an important role during muscle damage and regeneration. Muscle damage is characterized by compromised muscle fiber architecture, disruption of contractile protein integrity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Muscle regeneration is a complex process that involves restoration of mitochondrial function and activation of satellite cells (SC), the resident skeletal muscle stem cells. VDR expression is strongly upregulated following injury, particularly in central nuclei and SCs in animal models of muscle injury. Mechanistic studies provide some insight into the possible role of vitamin D activity in injured muscle. In vitro and in vivo rodent studies show that vitamin D mitigates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, augments antioxidant capacity, and prevents oxidative stress, a common antagonist in muscle damage. Additionally, VDR knockdown results in decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and ATP production, suggesting that vitamin D is crucial for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity; an important driver of muscle regeneration. Vitamin D regulation of mitochondrial health may also have implications for SC activity and self-renewal capacity, which could further affect muscle regeneration. However, the optimal timing, form and dose of vitamin D, as well as the mechanism by which vitamin D contributes to maintenance and restoration of muscle strength following injury, have not been determined. More research is needed to determine mechanistic action of 1,25(OH)D on mitochondria and SCs, as well as how this action manifests following muscle injury in vivo. Moreover, standardization in vitamin D sufficiency cut-points, time-course study of the efficacy of vitamin D administration, and comparison of multiple analogs of vitamin D are necessary to elucidate the potential of vitamin D as a significant contributor to muscle regeneration following injury. Here we will review the contribution of vitamin D to skeletal muscle regeneration following injury.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/skeletal-muscle-regeneration-and-mitochondrial-health-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=vitamin-d-helps-muscles-in-many-ways--sept-2021>Vitamin D helps muscles in many ways – Sept 2021</h4><p><strong>Muscle Regeneration and Function in Sports: A Focus on Vitamin D</strong></p><p>Medicina 2021, 57(10), 1015; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57101015>https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57101015</a></p><p>by Giovanni Iolascon 1,Antimo Moretti 1,*OrcID,Marco Paoletta 1OrcID,Sara Liguori 1 andOmbretta Di Munno 2</p><ul><li><p>1 Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties and Dentistry, University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”, Via de Crecchio, 6, 80138 Naples, Italy</p></li><li><p>2 Rheumatology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56122 Pisa, Italy</p></li></ul><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/muscle-2021.jpg alt=image width=900><p>Muscle is one of the main targets for the biological effects of vitamin D.

Vitamin D supplementation enhances muscle differentiation, growth, and regeneration by increasing the expression of myogenic factors in satellite cells. The objective of this narrative review is to describe the role of vitamin D in sport-related muscle injury and tissue regeneration.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/muscle-regeneration.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=the-roles-of-vitamin-d-in-skeletal-muscle-feb-2013>The Roles of Vitamin D in Skeletal Muscle Feb 2013</h4><p><strong>The Roles of Vitamin D in Skeletal Muscle: Form, Function, and Metabolism</strong></p><p>Endocrine Reviews February 1, 2013 vol. 34 no. 1 33-83</p><p>Christian M.

Reports of profound muscle weakness and changes in the muscle morphology of adults with vitamin D deficiency have long been described. These reports have been supplemented by numerous trials assessing the impact of vitamin D on muscle strength and mass and falls in predominantly elderly and deficient populations. At a basic level, animal models have confirmed that vitamin D deficiency and congenital aberrations in the vitamin D endocrine system may result in muscle weakness. To explain these effects, some molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D impacts on muscle cell differentiation, intracellular calcium handling, and genomic activity have been elucidated. There are also suggestions that vitamin D alters muscle metabolism, specifically its sensitivity to insulin, which is a pertinent feature in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We will review the range of human clinical, animal, and cell studies that address the impact of vitamin D in skeletal muscle, and discuss the controversial issues. This is a vibrant field of research and one that continues to extend the frontiers of knowledge of vitamin D&rsquo;s broad functional repertoire.</p><h5 id=i-introduction>I.

The objective of this RCT was to determine the effect of monthly supplemental vitamin D3 onmuscle function in 70+ years old adults. Participants (n = 379) were randomized to receive, 12,000 IU, 24,000 IU or 48,000 IU of vitamin D3 monthly for 12 months. Standardized Hand Grip Strength (GS) and Timed-Up and Go (TUG) were measured before and after vitamin D3 supplementation. Fasting total plasma 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) concentrations were measured by Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS) and immunoassay, respectively. Baseline plasma 25OHD concentrations were 41.3 (SD 19.9), 39.5 (SD 20.6), 38.9 (SD 19.7) nmol/L; GS values were 28.5 (SD 13.4), 28.8 (SD 13.0) and 28.1 (SD 12.1) kg and TUG test values were 10.8 (SD 2.5), 11.6 (SD 2.9) and 11.9 (SD 3.6) s for the 12,000 IU, 24,000 IU and 48,000 IU dose groups, respectively. Baseline plasma 25OHD concentration &lt; 25 nmol/L was associated with lower GS (P = 0.003). Post-interventional plasma 25OHD concentrations increased to 55.9 (SD 15.6), 64.6 (SD15.3) and 79.0 (SD 15.1) nmol/L in the 12,000 IU, 24,000 IU and 48,000 IU dose groups, respectively and there was a significant dose-related response in post-interventional plasma 25OHD concentration (p&lt;0.0001). Post-interventional GS values were 24.1 (SD 10.1), 26.2 (SD10.6) and 25.7 (SD 9.4) kg and TUG test values were 11.5 (SD 2.6), 12.0 (SD 3.7) and 11.9 (SD 3.2) s for 12,000 IU, 24,000 IU and 48,000 IU dose groups, respectively. The change (Δ) in GS and TUG from pre to post-intervention was not different between treatment groups before and after the adjustment for confounders, suggesting no effect of the intervention. Plasma 25OHD concentration was not associated with GS and TUG test after supplementation. In conclusion, plasma 25OHD concentration &lt; 25 nmol/L was associated with lower GS at baseline. However, monthly vitamin D3 supplementation with 12,000 IU, 24,000 IU and 48,000 IU, for 12 months had no effect on muscle function in older adults aged 70+ years.

However, which serum vitamin D biomarker better reflects sarcopenia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between various serum vitamin D biomarkers (total 25-hydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, bioavailable 25(OH)D, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[24,25(OH)2 D]</span>, and vitamin D metabolite ratio <span>[VMR]</span>) and sarcopenia.</p><p>Methods: The data for 83 hip fracture patients were finally included in the analysis. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. Measurements of 24,25(OH)2 D and 25(OH)D were made using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and subsequent liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The VMR was calculated by dividing serum 24,25(OH)2 D by serum 25(OH)D and then multiplying by 100. Based on total 25(OH)D, VDBP, and albumin concentrations, bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated using the equations from the other previous studies.</p><p>Results: Bioavailable 25(OH)D levels were significantly (p = 0.030) decreased in the sarcopenia group compared with the non-sarcopenia group. Results of ROC analysis for the diagnosis of sarcopenia using serum level of bioavailable of 25(OH)D revealed that the cutoff point for bioavailable 25(OH)D was 1.70 ng/ml (AUC = 0.649, p &lt; 0.001). In the group with a bioavailable 25(OH)D less than 1.70 ng/ml, the incidence of sarcopenia increased by <strong>3.3 times</strong> (odds ratio: 3.33, p = 0.013).</p><p>Conclusion: We demonstrated that bioavailable 25(OH)D was associated with sarcopenia among the various serum vitamin D biomarkers. Bioavailable vitamin D might be helpful for assessing the risk of sarcopenia.</p><hr><h4 id=some-reduced-muscle-function-associated-with-many-vitamin-d-genes---review-sept-2021>Some reduced muscle function associated with many Vitamin D genes - Review Sept 2021</h4><p><strong>Association between Polymorphisms in Vitamin D Pathway-Related Genes, Vitamin D Status, Muscle Mass and Function: A Systematic Review</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-genes-and-muscles.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=see-also-muscular-dystrophy-probably-treated-by-high-dose-vitamin-d-plus-muscle-rehabpostsmuscular-dystrophy-probably-treated-by-high-dose-vitamin-d-plus-muscle-rehab>See also: <a href=/posts/muscular-dystrophy-probably-treated-by-high-dose-vitamin-d-plus-muscle-rehab>Muscular Dystrophy probably treated by high-dose Vitamin D plus muscle rehab</a></h4><hr><h4 id=creatine-might-help-grow-senior-muscles-when-added-to-exercise>Creatine might help grow senior muscles when added to exercise</h4><ul><li><p>Effect of 12 months of creatine supplementation and whole-body resistance training on measures of bone, muscle and strength in older males - 2021, Vol. 27(2) 151–159 DOI: 10.1177/0260106020975247 FREE PDF</p></li><li><p><a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-is-creatine-can-it-treat-sarcopenia/?utm_source=NutritionFacts.org&amp;utm_campaign=4b5e101faf-RSS_VIDEO_DAILY&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_40f9e497d1-4b5e101faf-25209481&amp;mc_cid=4b5e101faf&amp;mc_eid=b95641625a">Creatine allows muscle growth with exercise by reducing muscle pain</a> Greger - Sept 2023</p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>autoimmune</span>
