#### Annual = Not good

During the past decade research studies have found that annual doses of vitamin D do not provide much benefit.

There are far fewer studies publishing results with annual doses.

Mostly the studies being published since 2010 are ones which were started many years ago.

We are unaware of any new [Clinical Trials using annual doses](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=annual+%22vitamin+d%22)

Sometimes annual doses have actually ended up causing problems - such as more falls.

Imagine the consequences of taking  years worth of any food, supplement, or drug in a single day:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such as: salt, water, iodine, aspirin, sugar, wheat, vitamin A, etc, etc.

Vitamin D is perhaps the only item for which taking the annual amount in a single day will not cause a call to 911 or immediate death

#### Quarterly = OK for some

Quarterly doses of vitamin D result in significant variations in blood levels of vitamin D - which stresses the body.

It appears, however, that the benefits of vitamin D outweigh the stresses of quarterly dosing.

#### Monthly = OK for most

The half-life for vitamin D for most people is approximately 1 month.

So, for most people, taking vitamin D monthly will result in a blood level of vitamin D which drops perhaps 30% by the end of the month

This variation results in some stress on the body.

Evolution has created bodies which typically experience even larger summer-winter changes in vitamin D levels

Note: there is some thought that the body needs to have variation in the vitamin D level - so should not keep it at a constant level all year long

#### The half life of vitamin D appears to be about a week for high level of vitamin D

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Thus monthly doses of vitamin D appears to be NOT appropriate for people with vitamin D levels higher than 50ng/ml</span>**

#### Weekly = Great for most

Virtually everyone can take vitamin D weekly, say on Saturday, without any problems. 

Note: Should probably take vitamin D [co-factors](/tags/co-factors.html) more frequently.

The body cannot take a whole weeks worth at a time and the body does not store some of the co-factors very well.
