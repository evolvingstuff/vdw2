 **Including Food 25-Hydroxyvitamin D in Intake Estimates May Reduce the Discrepancy   
&nbsp; &nbsp; between Dietary and Serum Measures of Vitamin D Status** 

J Nutr. 2014 Mar 12.

The discrepancy between the commonly used vitamin D status measures-intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations-has been perplexing. Sun exposure increases serum 25(OH)D concentrations and is often used as an explanation for the higher population-based serum concentrations in the face of apparently low vitamin D intake. However, sun exposure may not be the total explanation. 

25(OH)D, a metabolite of vitamin D, is known to be present in animal-based foods. 

It has been measured and reported only sporadically and is not currently factored into U.S. estimates of vitamin D intake. Previously unavailable preliminary USDA data specifying the 25(OH)D content of a subset of foods allowed exploration of the potential change in the reported overall vitamin D content of foods when the presence of 25(OH)D was included. The issue of 25(OH)D potency was addressed, and available commodity intake estimates were used to outline trends in projected vitamin D intake when 25(OH)D in foods was taken into account. Given the data available, there were notable increases in the total vitamin D content of a number of animal-based foods when potency-adjusted 25(OH)D was included, and in turn there was a potentially meaningful increase (1.7-2.9 μg or 15-30% of average requirement) in vitamin D intake estimates. The apparent increase could reduce discrepancies between intake estimates and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. The relevance to dietary interventions is discussed, and the need for continued exploration regarding 25(OH)D measurement is highlighted.

#### Cooked eggs about 8 X higher effective vitamin D when consider that already processed by the liver - June 2017

 **Vitamin D₃ and 25-Hydroxyvitamin D₃ Content of Retail White Fish and Eggs in Australia** 

Nutrients. 2017 Jun 22;9(7). pii: E647. [doi: 10.3390/nu9070647.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9070647.)

 **Cooked caged eggs effective vitamin D  = 7.7X: 4.6 (5 X 4 mcg + 0.6 mcg) / 0.6 mcg** 

Dietary vitamin D may compensate for inadequate sun exposure; however, there have been few investigations into the vitamin D content of Australian foods. We measured vitamin D₃ and 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (25(OH)D₃) in four species of white fish (barramundi, basa, hoki and king dory), and chicken eggs (cage and free-range), purchased from five Australian cities. Samples included local, imported and wild-caught fish, and eggs of varying size from producers with a range of hen stocking densities. Raw and cooked samples were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array. Limits of reporting were 0.2 and 0.1 μg/100 g for vitamin D₃ and 25(OH)D₃, respectively. 

The vitamin D₃ content of cooked white fish ranged from <0.1 to 2.3 μg/100 g, and the 25(OH)D₃ content ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 μg/100 g. 

The vitamin D₃ content of cooked cage eggs ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 μg/100 g, and the 25(OH)D₃ content ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 μg/100 g. 

The vitamin D₃ content of cooked free-range eggs ranged from 0.3 to 2.2 μg/100 g, and the 25(OH)D₃ content ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 μg/100 g.

If, as has been suggested, 25(OH)D₃ has five times greater bioactivity than vitamin D₃, one cooked serve (100 g) of white fish, and one cooked serve of cage or free-range eggs (120 g) may provide 50% or 100%, respectively, of the current guidelines for the adequate intake of vitamin D (5 µg) for Australians aged 1-50 years.
