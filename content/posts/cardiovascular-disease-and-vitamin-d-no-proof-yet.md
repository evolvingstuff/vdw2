#### Optimal Vitamin D Supplementation Levels for Cardiovascular Disease Protection.

Dis Markers. 2015;2015:864370. [doi: 10.1155/2015/864370.](https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/864370.) Epub 2015 Sep 8.

First described in relation to musculoskeletal disease, there is accumulating data to suggest that vitamin D may play an important role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review we aim to provide an overview of the role of vitamin D status as both a marker of and potentially causative agent of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. The role of vitamin D levels as a disease marker for all-cause mortality is also discussed. We review the current knowledge gathered from experimental studies, observational studies, randomised controlled trials, and subsequent systematic reviews in order to suggest the optimal vitamin D level for CVD protection.

#### Conclusions

There are weak signals of benefit of vitamin D supplementation

in heart failure, whilst studies have so far shown vitamin

D to be ineffective as an agent in lowering blood pressure and

thus it should not be used as an antihypertensive agent. In

CAD, AF, PVD, and stroke, although low vitamin D levels

are associated with disease occurrence, supplementation has

not yet been shown to be of benefit. Whether vitamin D is

a causal factor or convenient biomarker is not yet established

and maybe supplementation in cohorts of older adults may be

too late. Modest reductions in all-cause mortality by vitamin

D3 were demonstrated by meta-analysis <sup>[71]</sup>, but the number

needed for benefit was around 150 and, due to attrition bias,

the reliability of the estimate was low.

On the other hand, vitamin D deficiency is very prevalent

and modest improvements might make substantial health

gains, with a low risk of adverse outcome. On the strength

of current evidence, supplementation for optimum cardiovascular

outcomes alone does not seem to be a justifiable

position, but, for overall health, following IOM <sup>[74]</sup> and

National Institute for Health and Care (NICE) guidance <sup>[80]</sup>

is the best effort to answer an underinvestigated question. A

number of areas, particularly heart failure, warrant controlled

trials look for robust evidence for a potentially cheap, low risk,

and effective treatment option
