BACKGROUND:

The association between vitamin D status at birth and allergen sensitizations is uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of cord blood vitamin D status with allergen sensitizations and the development of atopic diseases in early childhood.

METHODS:

Children aged 0 through 4 years from a birth cohort in the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children (PATCH) study were enrolled. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in cord blood were measured by a new automated electrochemiluminescence-based assay. Specific IgE antibodies against food and inhalant allergens were measured at 6 months, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 years of age.

RESULTS:

A total of 186 children were regular followed up at clinics for a four-year follow-up period. The mean levels of cord blood 25(OH)D was 23.8 ± 9.5 ng/mL with a high prevalence of low vitamin D status (< 20 ng/mL) at birth (42%). There was a tendency of low cord blood 25(OH)D levels being associated with higher risk of food sensitization throughout childhood. 

Cord blood 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with the risk of milk sensitization at age 2, at which age a higher prevalence of milk sensitization was significantly associated with the risk of allergic rhinitis and asthma development at age 4.

CONCLUSIONS:

Low cord blood vitamin D levels appear to be associated with increased milk sensitization but not with asthma, eczema or allergic rhinitis in early childhood. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
