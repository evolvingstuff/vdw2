 **Reasons for the low vitamin D level include** 

1. [Very Dark Skins need 4X more sunshine to produce the same amount of vitamin D](/posts/overview-dark-skin-and-vitamin-d)

1. Protect against the hot sun by wearing hats and lots of clothes

1. Diet 

   * Excessive Omega-6 (which blocks Omega-3)

   * Lack of Magnesium n food and water (Mg essential in 8 stages of Vitamin D metabolism)

   * Virtually no Vitamin D from food (especially for meatless diet)

   * Zero Vitamin D fortification of food in India

1. [Air pollution](/posts/air-pollution-reduces-vitamin-d-production-many-studies) greatly decreases the UVB needed to make Vitamin D

BACKGROUND:

There is reservation about accepting the notion of widespread vitamin-D deficiency (VDD) in sunny countries because information base is largely urban indoors and the cut-off serum 25(OH)D > 75.0 nmol/L to define sufficiency is perceived as high.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the vitamin-D status of subjects engaged in six types of outdoors jobs with freedom to seek shade, when needed.

DESIGN: Descriptive observational study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

573 outdoors, (hawkers, n = 144; autorickshaw-drivers, n = 113; manual-rickshaw pullers, n = 49; fuel-station attendants, n = 84; gardeners, n = 96; traffic-police personnel, n = 87) were assessed for serum 25(OH)D, iPTH and total calcium during summer and winter. Bank-employees were indoor controls (n = 72). Serum 25(OH)D was defined as sufficient if ≥ 50.0 nmol/L and deficient when < 30.0 nmol/L, as per 'Institute of Medicine'.

RESULTS:

Mean serum 25(OH)D of 573 outdoors was 44.8 ± 19.6 nmol/L and showed a physiological inverse-relation with iPTH (P < 0.001). 77.5% of the outdoors did not have VDD. 

* Hawkers, 

* gardeners, 

* fuel-station attendants and 

* rickshaw-pullers 

had sufficient or near sufficient serum 25(OH)D. The mean serum 25(OH)D (30.6 ± 23.2 nmol/L) of indoors though lower by 12.7 nmol/L than outdoors, was above the cut-off of VDD. Proportions with supranormal iPTH were comparable between outdoors and indoors (14.0% vs. 20.8%). Despite winter dip the mean serum 25(OH)D (31.2 ± 14.3 nmol/l) of outdoors was not deficient.

CONCLUSIONS:

VDD is not universal. Most urban outdoor workers do not have vitamin D deficiency. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
