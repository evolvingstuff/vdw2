## Example

50,000 IU Vitamin D every two weeks during most of pregnancy = 3,600 IU average daily

3,600 IU is not enough Vitamin D for breast feeding without supplementing

<span style="color:black;background-color:#FF3;">50,000 IU of vitamin D every week shortly before birth will stock up on vitamin D (7,100 IU average)</span>

<span style="color:black;background-color:#3F0;">Must continue at that same rate until finished breast feeding</span>

> But during the past 40 or so years supplementation has been typically required

> Some of the recent reasons include:

Air conditioning - allows avoiding the hot sun 

Increased use of multi-media indoors 

More indoor jobs - more office workers, fewer farmers 

Live in cities - 30% in 1950, 70% in 2050 

Want whiter skin - especially women 

Fear skin cancer - avoid the sun

Less cholesterol - which the skin needs to produce vitamin D 

More Obesity - which makes about 1/2 of vitamin D unavailable
