### One table from the article  
RISK INCREASE WITH LOW VITAMIN D LEVELS*

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Autoimmune: Multiple Sclerosis 78 | 61% |
| Autoimmune: Psoriasis 79 | 189% |
| Autoimmune: Rheumatoid Arthritis 80 | 24% (Patients taking vitamin D supplements had 24% lower risk.) |
| Cancer, Bladder 54 | 83% overall; 494% for invasive tumors |
| Cancer, Breast 53 | 150% |
| Cancer, Thyroid 55 | 100% |
| Cognitive Decline 7 | 41 to 60% |
| Cardiovascular: (Risk of Heart Attack)12,13,15 | 38 to 192% |
| Dementia, Alzheimer's 43 | 77% increase for lowest vitamin D intake |
| Dementia, Non-Alzheimer's 7 | Almost 20-fold increase |
| Infection, Respiratory 81 | 36% |  |
| Metabolic: Diabetes 4,82 | 91% for insulin resistance<br>38 to 106% for type 2 diabetes |
| Metabolic: Risk of progression <br>from normal blood glucose to diabetes 83 | 77% |
| Stroke 13,84 | 22 to 64% |

&nbsp; &nbsp;* Defined either as serum levels less than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L), 

&nbsp; &nbsp;or as lowest percentiles vs. highest; risk expressed as percent increased for those with normal or highest levels.

### Fairly good overview of vitamin D

>30 ng = sufficiency (standard)

1 billion people have < 30ng (does not mention far more people do not have optimal (50ng) nor high optimal (80 ng))

64% of Americans do not have enough to operate at ‘’peak capacity’’ ( 30 ng)

>50 ng = minimum optimal ([lots of discussion on 50 ng being too low, jut right, or too high)](/tags/lots-of-discussion-on-50-ng-being-too-low-jut-right-or-too-high.html)

80 ng = high optimal (Unaware that any national standard board recommends this level yet, but I agree)

Shows association of 40+ diseases with low levels of vitamin D

### Uses old estimate of how many IU to increase blood level

Uses old rule of thumb: need [100 IU for each additional 1ng of vitamin D](/tags/100-iu-for-each-additional-1ng-of-vitamin-d.html)

The old estimate is wrong in that the equation is not linear, varies with nanogram level, and varies with body weight

Their example 20 ng ==> 50 ng would equate to  **3,000 IU**  needed

[GrassRootsHealth chart](/tags/grassrootshealth-chart.html) indicates 29 IU per lb. For 20 ==> 50 ng

To get to 50 ng a 200 lb person would need to take  **5,800 IU**
