* "The binding sites were found to be unusually concentrated near a number of genes which have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune conditions such as 

> MS, 

> Crohnâ€™s disease, 

> lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as to 

> cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colorectal cancer."
