#### Dr. Pierre Kory Reveals Why Big Pharma is ‘TERRIFIED’ of Vitamin D

 **[1 minute clip](https://vigilantnews.com/post/dr-pierre-kory-big-pharma-is-terrified-of-vitamin-d/)** 

 **Transcript**  

* Korry: Fortify immune systems and help protect against severe disease that we thought that are super safe, that on a risk benefit precautionary principle, we should have, as a rule, just recommended vitamin D. For one, we should add a vitamin D supplementation campaign nationwide, would've been very easy to do. Now, as an aside,  **vitamin D has been one of the most attacked substances over the last three or four decades by the pharmaceutical industry** .

* Carlson: Why? 

* Korry:  **It threatens the disease model** . I mean, we can do an hour on vitamin D, Tucker, but...

* Carlson: Vitamin D like in milk? 

* Korry: Yes, like vitamin D. Vitamin D is a whole other discussion, but they're terrified of vitamin D. Our normal reference point...

* Carlson: Okay. Can I, if you find yourself terrified of vitamins, you're probably on the wrong side.

* Korry: Exactly. You're probably on the wrong side.
