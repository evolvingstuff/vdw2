Fast forward to the 1980s. 

That’s when doctors in India treated six tuberculosis patients with  **3,800 international units (IU) of vitamin D**  daily for three months. 

The patients developed dangerously high blood levels of calcium. 

The doctors blaimed the vitamin D, but they never measured the patients’ blood levels of the vitamin, or acknowledged that super-high calcium levels could be common in people with tuberculosis. 

That study added to the stigma, and five years later, based on the available evidence, the U.S. government  **warned that as little as 1,000 IU of vitamin D daily could be toxic** .
