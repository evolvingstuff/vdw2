physics</p><p>00:0X from the University of California Berkeley</p><p>00:1X in 1971 he has had a 30-year career in</p><p>00:1X atmospheric sciences with an emphasis on</p><p>00:1X laser remote sensing of atmospheric</p><p>00:1X constituents such as ozone and aerosols</p><p>00:2X with positions at s RI International the</p><p>00:2X Jet Propulsion Laboratory California</p><p>00:2X Institute of Technology and NASA Langley</p><p>00:3X Research Center he turned to health</p><p>00:3X research in 1996 publishing the first</p><p>00:3X paper linking diet to risk of</p><p>00:4X Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in 1997 followed by</p><p>00:4X his studies of sugar fat and coronary</p><p>00:4X heart disease in 1998 and animal</p><p>00:4X products and cancer risk in 1998 in 1999</p><p>00:5X he turned his attention to the role of</p><p>00:5X solar ultraviolet B exposure in reducing</p><p>00:5X risk of many types of cancer through</p><p>01:0X production of vitamin D in 2012 after</p><p>01:0X retirement from NASA in 2000 2002 after</p><p>01:0X retirement from NASA in 2004 he moved to</p><p>01:1X San Francisco and formed the nonprofit</p><p>01:1X organization sunlight nutrition and</p><p>01:1X health research center which is WWN arc</p><p>01:2X AR CSUN AR c.org where he spends most of</p><p>01:2X his time studying the role of UVB solar</p><p>01:3X UVB exposure and vitamin D in reducing</p><p>01:3X risk of cancer and many other types of</p><p>01:3X disease he also investigates the role of</p><p>01:3X diet in risk of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in</p><p>01:4X cancer he has about 300 health</p><p>01:4X publications listed at WWE become of</p><p>01:4X which 210 are related to vitamin D with</p><p>01:5X 78% of these also on ultraviolet</p><p>01:5X radiation in human health and 41 to diet</p><p>01:5X and disease please welcome Bill Graham</p><p>02:0X thank you I&rsquo;m delighted to be back here</p><p>02:0X again I really have enjoyed this</p><p>02:1X organization I like cork you invited me</p><p>02:1X into it about 12 or 13 years ago and</p><p>02:1X I&rsquo;ve didn&rsquo;t involve ever since but don&rsquo;t</p><p>02:1X come to meetings very often now because</p><p>02:1X it&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m in the San Francisco and it&rsquo;s a</p><p>02:2X long way down here and back let&rsquo;s see</p><p>02:2X there you go</p><p>02:2X I do receive funding from biotech pharmacal</p><p>02:3X that&rsquo;s a vitamin company as a</p><p>02:3X supplier of research grade vitamin D for</p><p>02:3X health professionals and consumers they</p><p>02:3X have a website biotech for McHale calm</p><p>02:4X so I&rsquo;m going to discuss a number of</p><p>02:4X topics related to vitamin D this evening</p><p>02:4X first of all the vitamin D physiology</p><p>02:4X then I&rsquo;m gonna put the binding</p><p>02:5X recommendations right up in front</p><p>02:5X because I think that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re most</p><p>02:5X interested in then I&rsquo;ll tell you why if</p><p>02:5X I&rsquo;d be is important in terms of which</p><p>02:5X health outcomes are related to low</p><p>03:0X vitamin D whereas the Bundy policy</p><p>03:0X hitted so my latest research on how</p><p>03:0X vitamin D clinical trial should be</p><p>03:1X conducted and then tell you where to go</p><p>03:1X for additional information so vitamin d3</p><p>03:2X that&rsquo;s cholecalciferol can be made in</p><p>03:2X the skin or obtained from a food of</p><p>03:2X supplements there&rsquo;s also a vitamin d3</p><p>03:2X aerial cuss difficult which is made from</p><p>03:3X mushrooms or yeast or fun gene that&rsquo;s</p><p>03:3X not as effective as vitamin d3 it</p><p>03:3X doesn&rsquo;t last as long and it&rsquo;s not clear</p><p>03:4X that it has the same health benefits but</p><p>03:4X some people were vegans want to have no</p><p>03:4X animal products and all vitamin d3 is</p><p>03:4X made from animal products or almost all</p><p>03:4X there is a power plant source vitamin d3</p><p>03:5X but the vegans often want to go with a</p><p>03:5X d2 the liver converts vitamin d3 to – – –</p><p>03:5X hydroxy vitamin d3 by adding a hydroxyl</p><p>04:0X group and this is what is measured when</p><p>04:0X you go to the doctor&rsquo;s office and wonder</p><p>04:0X what your your blood level of vitamin D</p><p>04:1X is the half-life of this 25 hydroxy</p><p>04:1X Vaadin D is about two and a half</p><p>04:1X weeks now a kidney converts the 25</p><p>04:2X hydroxy body to 125 diet dihydroxy of</p><p>04:2X vitamin D and this this and the</p><p>04:3X parathyroid hormone PTH helped keep</p><p>04:3X serum calcium within a tight range the</p><p>04:3X 125 increases calcium absorption from</p><p>04:4X the intestines whereas a PTH increases</p><p>04:4X calcium absorption from the bones so we</p><p>04:4X have sort of a push and pull and so it&rsquo;s</p><p>04:4X there&rsquo;s not a direct correlation between</p><p>04:5X the amount of 25 and 125 but the more 25</p><p>04:5X you have the more 125 you can make there</p><p>05:0X are other actions of vitamin D and</p><p>05:0X that&rsquo;s what I primarily study most of</p><p>05:0X the action of vitamin D is through the</p><p>05:0X 125 entering the vine D receptors which</p><p>05:1X are coupled to chromosomes in there</p><p>05:1X every cell of the body when activated</p><p>05:1X the VTR&rsquo;s control the expression of many</p><p>05:2X genes up regulating most of them down</p><p>05:2X regulating others and it turns out that</p><p>05:2X not only a kidney can convert the 25 to</p><p>05:2X 125 but also other organs as needed</p><p>05:3X so for example you cancer someplace the</p><p>05:3X cells in that organ can also convert the</p><p>05:3X 25 to 125 and the skin it can convert 25</p><p>05:4X to 125 now Von D also fights bacterial</p><p>05:4X and some viral infections by inducing</p><p>05:5X production of Catholics seitan that&rsquo;s</p><p>05:5X the polypeptide with antimicrobial and</p><p>05:5X anti endotoxin properties fine B also</p><p>05:5X induces reduces inflammation by reducing</p><p>06:0X a production of pro-inflammatory</p><p>06:0X cytokines which are chemical messengers</p><p>06:0X to underscore the importance of vitamin</p><p>06:1X D for human health I note that skin</p><p>06:1X pigmentation varies globally depending</p><p>06:1X on where people live for hundreds to</p><p>06:1X thousands of years for example the the</p><p>06:2X Aborigines in Australia are very</p><p>06:2X dark-skinned their ancestors were from</p><p>06:2X the force of the Indonesia where</p><p>06:2X where they were brown-skinned but when</p><p>06:3X they got to Australia with no trees to</p><p>06:3X cover them they needed a very dark skin</p><p>06:3X to protect them from the very very</p><p>06:3X intense UV so dark skin in the tropics</p><p>06:4X reduces the risk of free radical</p><p>06:4X formation and skin cancer as well as</p><p>06:4X protecting against folate destruction</p><p>06:4X and folate is very important for</p><p>06:5X pregnancy and for pregnancy now as</p><p>06:5X humans moved out of Africa started</p><p>06:5X moving in northward they had to develop</p><p>07:0X lighter skin in order to make enough</p><p>07:0X vitamin D from the from the less intense</p><p>07:0X UV and they didn&rsquo;t need the protection</p><p>07:0X of the dark pigment against the free</p><p>07:1X radicals and full of destruction what</p><p>07:1X would happen they would get more</p><p>07:1X infectious diseases like tuberculosis</p><p>07:1X they would also get more rickets and</p><p>07:2X poor bone formation and so then the</p><p>07:2X pelvic cavity wouldn&rsquo;t be large enough</p><p>07:2X to let a feed on an infant come out in</p><p>07:2X the birth process and they hadn&rsquo;t</p><p>07:3X invented c-sections thousands of years</p><p>07:3X ago now Nina Jablonski and George</p><p>07:3X Chaplin and made a career out of going</p><p>07:4X around the world and measuring the un&ndash;</p><p>07:4X UV exposed pigment in many peoples</p><p>07:4X around the world and they have this</p><p>07:5X developed this map of skin pigmentation</p><p>07:5X they see very dark in the tropics where</p><p>07:5X you have no trees brown lighter color in</p><p>08:0X the tropical forest and very light in</p><p>08:0X the high latitudes so now let&rsquo;s go to</p><p>08:0X recommendations which I gave a talk in</p><p>08:1X Hungary last month and after I gave all</p><p>08:1X the information about what the benefits</p><p>08:1X are all I wanted to know was well how</p><p>08:1X much do I need how much should i what</p><p>08:1X should my level be so in 2011 the</p><p>08:2X Institute of Medicine announced that</p><p>08:2X adults up to the age of 7 years old</p><p>08:2X should have 600 ru per day over 70 years</p><p>08:3X they should have editor ru per day and</p><p>08:3X that 20 nanograms per milliliter vitamin</p><p>08:3X D concentration was 25 hydroxy vitamin E concentration</p><p>08:4X was just fine well it turns out that</p><p>08:4X that was a not a very sound study first</p><p>08:5X of all they were this was funded by the</p><p>08:5X Food and Drug Administration and the</p><p>08:5X National assistive health and Health</p><p>08:5X Canada and the two US organizations</p><p>09:0X worked very closely with Big Pharma and</p><p>09:0X also one of the organizers one of the</p><p>09:0X people on the committee had planned</p><p>09:1X another major vitamin E clinical trial</p><p>09:1X where people could take we&rsquo;re gonna take</p><p>09:1X 2000 IU of vitamin D per day in the</p><p>09:1X treatment arm but they got all my in the</p><p>09:2X treatment or the control arm could take</p><p>09:2X as much as the Institute of Medicine</p><p>09:2X recommended so in order not to sabotage</p><p>09:2X her clinical trial she pushed I think</p><p>09:3X very hard for these recommendations but</p><p>09:3X in order to reach these recommendations</p><p>09:3X they did three things which which are</p><p>09:3X not very scientific</p><p>09:4X first of all they ignored all non</p><p>09:4X skeletal effects they ignored cancer</p><p>09:4X cardiovascular disease autoimmune</p><p>09:4X diseases respiratory infections etc</p><p>09:4X second they demanded published</p><p>09:5X randomized controlled clinical trials of</p><p>09:5X a vitamin D and at a time when they did</p><p>09:5X a study all I could point to was</p><p>10:0X clinical trials for bone health</p><p>10:0X the third thing they did was they took a</p><p>10:0X study from Germany which looked at</p><p>10:0X people who died in automobile accidents</p><p>10:1X so they&rsquo;re healthy people just happen to</p><p>10:1X die prematurely and in the study they</p><p>10:1X they looked at the osteoid amount of the</p><p>10:2X bones noted as the unn mineralized</p><p>10:2X calcium in the bones sort of liquid or</p><p>10:2X gelatin life and they also compared the</p><p>10:3X 25 hydroxy vitamin D concentrations with</p><p>10:3X with the amount of this poor bone</p><p>10:3X mineralization and what they did was</p><p>10:3X they ignored the findings between 20 and</p><p>10:4X 30 nanograms in terms of they still had</p><p>10:4X a few at that point who had on</p><p>10:4X mineralized bone but they said that</p><p>10:5X wasn&rsquo;t important that most of the people</p><p>10:5X with underlies bone were below 20</p><p>10:5X nanograms so we&rsquo;re gonna stick with 20</p><p>10:5X he has been shown in many comments later</p><p>11:0X on that that was a major mistake and I</p><p>11:0X think the Institute of Medicine now</p><p>11:0X realizes that yeah but it took quite a</p><p>11:0X few years then I realized that now in</p><p>11:0X 2011 The Endocrine Society led by</p><p>11:1X Michael Holick team led by Michael</p><p>11:1X Holick published a recommendation for</p><p>11:1X dealing with a vitamin D deficiency now</p><p>11:1X it&rsquo;s the first one the Institute of</p><p>11:2X Medicine was for the general public healthy or not</p><p>11:2X the endocrine Society was dealing with</p><p>11:2X with people being treated by doctors</p><p>11:2X fortified in D deficiency so they</p><p>11:3X recommended a 1000 2000 IU per day of</p><p>11:3X item d2 or d3 and a serum vitamin e</p><p>11:3X concentration of around 30 nano grams</p><p>11:4X per milliliter at least they considered</p><p>11:4X 20 deficient between 20 and 30</p><p>11:4X insufficient above 30 sufficient however</p><p>11:5X there are finally advocacy organizations</p><p>11:5X which I&rsquo;ll name at the end who have</p><p>11:5X looked carefully at the the general</p><p>11:5X literature that comes out on a daily and</p><p>12:0X a weekly basis and have some of these</p><p>12:0X people have written peer-reviewed papers</p><p>12:0X on the benefits of item D and they&rsquo;ve</p><p>12:0X looked at people with higher</p><p>12:1X concentrations and and how much better</p><p>12:1X they do in terms of athletic performance</p><p>12:1X or lack of disease and they&rsquo;re</p><p>12:1X recommending around 2,000 to 5,000 IU</p><p>12:2X per day vitamin d3 not skipping vitamin</p><p>12:2X d2 and a serum concentration of around</p><p>12:2X 40 to 60 nano grams per milliliter</p><p>12:2X one of the reasons for saying 40 to 60</p><p>12:3X is that looking at healthy Africans</p><p>12:3X modern-day Africans who are outdoors</p><p>12:3X every day with dark skin with with some</p><p>12:4X clothing I mean they&rsquo;re not not just</p><p>12:4X annoying Clause but they have a fair</p><p>12:4X amount of clothing on they have around</p><p>12:4X forty five nanograms per milliliter</p><p>12:5X serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D and so you</p><p>12:5X have these three recommendations so well</p><p>13:0X now just to show a picture here</p><p>13:0X Roger bouillon on the on the left is one</p><p>13:0X of the most prominent finally</p><p>13:0X researchers in Europe believe he&rsquo;s in</p><p>13:1X Belgium he&rsquo;s a lot of European leaders</p><p>13:1X are the 20 nanograms per milliliter camp</p><p>13:2X Michael Holick on the other hand is the</p><p>13:2X leader of the 13 anagram plus camp now</p><p>13:2X there are three sources of vitamin D the</p><p>13:3X sunlight is the primary source this map</p><p>13:3X this is a shows on the bottom is a month</p><p>13:4X of the year from from January through</p><p>13:4X December along the y-axis you have the</p><p>13:4X latitude from zero the tropics up to 90</p><p>13:5X degrees at the top and the colors</p><p>13:5X indicate how much time you have to be in</p><p>14:0X the Sun in order to make I see how much</p><p>14:0X well let&rsquo;s see if you okay if it&rsquo;s red</p><p>14:1X you cannot make any vitamin D if it&rsquo;s in</p><p>14:1X the blue the purple range you can make</p><p>14:2X some vitamin E it&rsquo;s gonna take longer</p><p>14:2X like maybe up to half an hour an hour to</p><p>14:2X be in the Sun and if it&rsquo;s black you can</p><p>14:2X make it fairly easily so we&rsquo;re about 30</p><p>14:3X degrees north latitude here so in the</p><p>14:3X winter we have a difficult time making</p><p>14:3X vitamin D but by March or April through</p><p>14:4X about October we can make a fair amount</p><p>14:4X of vitamin D and this this map was 400 – -</p><p>14:4X IU of a per day of vitamin D now if you</p><p>14:5X need 2,000 to 4,000 5,000 IU per day</p><p>14:5X this is the this scale would be changed</p><p>14:5X also it turns out that there&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s a</p><p>14:5X shadow rule the dermatologist like to</p><p>15:0X tell you if your shadow is shorter than</p><p>15:0X you are stay out of the Sun or cover up</p><p>15:0X or use sunscreen the vitamin E advocates</p><p>15:0X like to say unless your shadow is</p><p>15:1X shorter than you are you&rsquo;re not gonna</p><p>15:1X make much vitamin D so that means you</p><p>15:1X want to go out in your solar noon you</p><p>15:1X want to go out in the in the summer</p><p>15:1X spring summer and fall you want to</p><p>15:2X expose as much of your body as possible</p><p>15:2X you want to one of the reasons for going</p><p>15:2X out midday in addition is that the ratio</p><p>15:2X of UVA to UVB changes the shorter the</p><p>15:3X wavelength the more scattering there is</p><p>15:3X in the atmosphere and the way you can</p><p>15:3X tell that is the sky is blue and clouds</p><p>15:4X are orange so as a sunset sunrise the</p><p>15:4X Sun goes the sun rays go through a very</p><p>15:4X very large path and the shorter</p><p>15:4X wavelengths are scattering the</p><p>15:5X wavelengths much more rapidly than they</p><p>15:5X are the long wavelengths so the orange</p><p>15:5X gets to the clouds the blue gets to the</p><p>15:5X sky well UVB is much shorter than the</p><p>16:0X blue and so it&rsquo;s scattered even more in</p><p>16:0X fact even if you&rsquo;re under an umbrella</p><p>16:0X you&rsquo;re going to get UVB impinging on you</p><p>16:0X from the sides the the the the diffuse</p><p>16:1X scattering but the UVB the UVA is going</p><p>16:1X to be less scatter than UVB in fact UVB</p><p>16:1X is about three to five percent of total</p><p>16:2X UV and the rest is UVA</p><p>16:2X the problem with UVA is that it</p><p>16:2X penetrates the skin deeper and is more</p><p>16:2X important more responsible for melanoma</p><p>16:3X and basal cell carcinoma then UVB is so</p><p>16:3X if you went out morning evening you&rsquo;re</p><p>16:3X more likely to get melanoma but no</p><p>16:4X vitamin D so I was in a hungry last month</p><p>16:4X went over there ten conferences in</p><p>16:4X Warsaw and Thessaloniki and stopped off</p><p>16:5X in Budapest and found this this like a</p><p>16:5X porcupine with sign under saying Sun so</p><p>16:5X the Sun is one way to get your your your</p><p>17:0X vitamin D but you can also get it from a</p><p>17:0X solarium the indoor tanning booths maybe</p><p>17:0X have two to four percent UVB in the UV</p><p>17:1X if you go in for tanning you&rsquo;re going to</p><p>17:1X see how much longer they need to for</p><p>17:1X vitamin D production it turns out that</p><p>17:1X after you make that up to 20 thousand</p><p>17:1X international units of vitamin D from</p><p>17:2X whole body exposure in a Sun and half an</p><p>17:2X hour to an hour the body&rsquo;s that the UV</p><p>17:2X starts destroying the metabolites of</p><p>17:2X vitamin D so he can never make too much</p><p>17:3X vitamin D in the Sun now the other</p><p>17:3X sources of vitamin D are supplements and</p><p>17:3X diet and in terms of diet its animal</p><p>17:4X products like seafood but it turns out</p><p>17:4X that that a study in England found that</p><p>17:4X the people with the highest vitamin D</p><p>17:5X concentrations were not the fish eaters</p><p>17:5X it was the meat eaters the vegans had</p><p>17:5X the lowest amount the vegetarians a</p><p>17:5X little bit higher but there is about a</p><p>18:0X 1/8 nanogram per milliliter difference</p><p>18:0X between the meat eaters and the vegans</p><p>18:0X the reason is that meat has vitamin D as</p><p>18:0X 25 hydroxy vitamin D so most of the food</p><p>18:1X tables that talk about vitamin D do not</p><p>18:1X read do not include that in the study so</p><p>18:2X all these food frequency tables and how</p><p>18:2X much find here get from fewer eggs and</p><p>18:2X from your milk and so on they would find</p><p>18:2X about 250 to 300 IU per day in the American diet</p><p>18:3X not counting what&rsquo;s in a meat</p><p>18:3X and of course 250 and 300 are you per</p><p>18:3X day is not enough to to do much now</p><p>18:3X there are other effects of UV exposure</p><p>18:4X one thing you do is you get beta</p><p>18:4X endorphins which help reduce pain and</p><p>18:4X help you feel better</p><p>18:5X in fact the dermatologists realize that</p><p>18:5X people often go to tanning beds on a</p><p>18:5X regular basis because they get an</p><p>18:5X endorphin high and the claim is that</p><p>19:0X they&rsquo;re getting addicted to tanning</p><p>19:0X because of the beta endorphins mike my</p><p>19:0X thought is that anything that has</p><p>19:0X long-term benefits nature and sometimes</p><p>19:1X provides short-term benefits to make you</p><p>19:1X understand that their long-term benefits</p><p>19:1X and so I think there&rsquo;s a you know should</p><p>19:1X be applauded rather than criticize</p><p>19:2X another thing is you can release my</p><p>19:2X trick oxide subcutaneous nitrogen</p><p>19:2X compounds which can lead to lower blood</p><p>19:2X pressure in fact if you look at the</p><p>19:3X latitudinal distribution of blood</p><p>19:3X pressure it&rsquo;s lowest in the tropics and</p><p>19:3X highest in the high latitudes of course</p><p>19:3X that could also be related to dietary</p><p>19:3X factors but but it could be related to</p><p>19:3X some what - to UV there are some we&rsquo;ll</p><p>19:4X see multiple sclerosis has a very</p><p>19:4X pronounced latitudinal effect and four</p><p>19:4X years of thought that that was because</p><p>19:5X of vitamin D production but now both</p><p>19:5X human studies and and animal studies</p><p>19:5X have indicated that there are benefits</p><p>19:5X of UV aside from vitamin D production</p><p>20:0X that reduced the risk of multiple</p><p>20:0X sclerosis of course there are other</p><p>20:0X effects you can reset your biological</p><p>20:0X clock through the blue light around 420</p><p>20:1X nanometers I found out when I went to</p><p>20:1X say Sweden in February I was there for</p><p>20:1X two weeks and never got on Swedish time</p><p>20:1X and last month I was in in Warsaw for a</p><p>20:2X week and it rained every day and I did</p><p>20:2X not get on Warsaw time finally in in</p><p>20:2X Budapest I started with sunlight I start</p><p>20:2X to get over on the European time also</p><p>20:3X turns out that as I was so later than</p><p>20:3X just getting outside and exercising is</p><p>20:3X very beneficial and has health effects you</p><p>20:4X tentative of vitamin D so those most</p><p>20:4X likely to have low vitamin E</p><p>20:4X concentrations are those spending most</p><p>20:4X time indoors this will also include</p><p>20:5X those who have do shift work and sleep</p><p>20:5X during the day because they work at</p><p>20:5X night not being the Sun nurse solar noon</p><p>20:5X went with sufficient body surface</p><p>20:5X exposed dark-skinned people I&rsquo;m working</p><p>21:0X on a manuscript on the health benefits</p><p>21:0X of vitamin D for dark-skinned people in</p><p>21:0X the United States we&rsquo;re going to Bruce</p><p>21:0X Ames on this and see if the average the</p><p>21:1X mean casa</p><p>21:1X 25 hydroxy vitamin d concentration for white</p><p>21:1X adult American Americans is around 21 ?</p><p>21:2X nanograms per milliliter of course our</p><p>21:2X seasonal variation is gonna be a factor</p><p>21:2X of 2 between summer and winter for</p><p>21:2X Hispanics is more like 21 nanograms and</p><p>21:3X for black Americans and more like 1 ?</p><p>21:3X nanograms so yeah in Africa they had all</p><p>21:4X the vitamin E they needed but not here</p><p>21:4X in the United States those who are</p><p>21:4X overweight or obese I generally have</p><p>21:4X much lower body concentrations than</p><p>21:4X those who are normal weight wearing</p><p>21:5X sunscreen or even wearing using skin</p><p>21:5X lightening cream reduces the vitamin E</p><p>21:5X production and it turns out older folks</p><p>22:0X over the age of 60 and perhaps even</p><p>22:0X little bit younger have less of the 7 d</p><p>22:0X high high low cholesterol in a thinner</p><p>22:0X skin that that is converted to two</p><p>22:1X vitamin D and salami didn&rsquo;t may need to</p><p>22:1X stay in the Sun two to three to four</p><p>22:1X times longer to make the same amount of</p><p>22:1X vitamin D so there are values of</p><p>22:2X measuring 25 hydroxy vitamin D and also</p><p>22:2X turns out that even if you take a</p><p>22:3X thousand or 2,000 I you if I marry per</p><p>22:3X day there&rsquo;s a large variation in the</p><p>22:3X response to to vitamin D some people may</p><p>22:4X make twice as much 25 from the same out</p><p>22:4X of oral vitamin D and turns out it</p><p>22:4X depends on whether you take it with a</p><p>22:5X large meal so it goes slow</p><p>22:5X intestines whether you&rsquo;re taking more</p><p>22:5X magnesium to help conversion 225 etc etc</p><p>22:5X so if you really want to know where your</p><p>23:0X your concentration is you really ought</p><p>23:0X to have your 25 hydroxy vitamin D</p><p>23:0X measured you can have your doctor do it</p><p>23:0X but you can also go to grassroots health</p><p>23:1X net or the Van Dien Council org and both</p><p>23:1X of them sell a blood spot kit and you</p><p>23:2X get a little Lance you draw three or</p><p>23:2X four spots of blood and put it on a card</p><p>23:2X there&rsquo;s dried blood just sent back to</p><p>23:2X them they they sent it to a laboratory</p><p>23:2X and they it&rsquo;s very accurate they use</p><p>23:3X Hema they use an average Hema crit value</p><p>23:3X for the entire population around well so</p><p>23:3X if your Hema crypt is somewhat different</p><p>23:4X from from normal that might be a slight</p><p>23:4X error but I&rsquo;ve checked it out some time</p><p>23:4X ago and when I was taking more like</p><p>23:4X $5,000 per day and I got 65 67 and 6 -?</p><p>23:5X nanograms per milliliter depending on</p><p>23:5X the blood spot test</p><p>23:5X and two of the wet chemistry labs so I</p><p>24:0X think they&rsquo;re quite a Qi accurate</p><p>24:0X grassroots health also has a program</p><p>24:0X where you can have your your 25 hydroxy</p><p>24:0X dividing measured every six months and</p><p>24:1X you&rsquo;re then entered into a scientific</p><p>24:1X study they want you to stay in it for</p><p>24:1X about five years they&rsquo;ll ever ask your</p><p>24:1X health question how&rsquo;s your health what</p><p>24:1X did you did you fall did you get sick</p><p>24:1X etc etc and they&rsquo;ve actually used these</p><p>24:2X results in several peer-reviewed</p><p>24:2X publications so now we get into the</p><p>24:2X benefits why you really want vitamin D</p><p>24:3X I&rsquo;m gonna skip bones because I really</p><p>24:3X haven&rsquo;t study bones that was sort of the</p><p>24:3X classical vitamin D area and it&rsquo;s been</p><p>24:3X the last almost two decades now that the</p><p>24:4X non skeletal effects have become very</p><p>24:4X important and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve studied</p><p>24:4X so there&rsquo;s cancer there&rsquo;s respiratory</p><p>24:4X tract infections there&rsquo;s adverse</p><p>24:5X pregnancy and birth outcomes premature</p><p>24:5X death autism and ADHD dental caries poor</p><p>24:5X sleep cognitive dysfunction Alzheimer</p><p>25:0X disease erectile dysfunction and low testosterone</p><p>25:0X so there&rsquo;s said to be something for</p><p>25:0X everybody in here if not you your</p><p>25:0X children or your grandchildren so the</p><p>25:1X the first link between UV exposure and</p><p>25:1X lower risk of cancer was made by the</p><p>25:1X brothers cedric and frank garland who as</p><p>25:2X beginning graduate students at johns</p><p>25:2X hopkins school of public health and</p><p>25:2X knights en 74 saw a map something like</p><p>25:2X this it only had five color scales</p><p>25:3X instead of ten but they saw that there</p><p>25:3X was lower colon cancer in the southwest</p><p>25:3X in higher colon cancer in northeast they</p><p>25:3X just driven driven from Sandy Hill to</p><p>25:4X Maryland and then it was very sunny in</p><p>25:4X the southwest and not very sunny in the</p><p>25:4X Northeast so they hypothesized that</p><p>25:4X since the primary the</p><p>25:5X largest physiological effect of sunlight</p><p>25:5X is widen D production that bottom D must</p><p>25:5X reduce the risk of cancer well it took</p><p>26:0X them six years to get that paper</p><p>26:0X published and then it was an in a</p><p>26:0X British Journal which is finally finally</p><p>26:0X published in but nobody really took much</p><p>26:1X notice of it in 1985 they show that</p><p>26:1X dietary vitamin D was linked to low</p><p>26:1X cancer risk in 1989 they showed that low</p><p>26:2X serum 25 hydroxy vitamin is linked to</p><p>26:2X low colon cancer risk</p><p>26:2X they also extended this to breast cancer</p><p>26:2X and ovarian cancer somebody else did</p><p>26:3X prostate cancer and lymphoma but you can</p><p>26:3X understand that since no I was gonna get</p><p>26:3X rich selling vitamin D or selling</p><p>26:4X sunlight that the medical system had</p><p>26:4X just sort of said not much so I came</p><p>26:4X along in 1999 after doing some work</p><p>26:4X mentioned on on dietary factors and I</p><p>26:5X saw these new maps that were published</p><p>26:5X by the National Institutes of Health and</p><p>26:5X I saw all the read of the Northeast</p><p>27:0X except for prostate cancer was in the</p><p>27:0X northwest and I said gee maybe I can</p><p>27:0X explain this based on dietary factors</p><p>27:0X well I took two weeks to realize that we</p><p>27:1X eat the same food countrywide except in</p><p>27:1X the South would have Allah barbecue now</p><p>27:1X if you look at these you&rsquo;ll see very</p><p>27:1X similar patterns breast</p><p>27:1X again high mortality rates in the Northeast</p><p>27:2X but you have some also some high breast</p><p>27:2X cancer rates along the West Coast turns</p><p>27:2X out that along the coast you have more</p><p>27:2X clouds and fog and so people are not</p><p>27:3X getting as much UVB along the coast that</p><p>27:3X they were inland so breast cancer is not</p><p>27:3X quite as strong a link between UVB</p><p>27:3X Vaughn B and in reduced risk as colon</p><p>27:4X cancer for kidney cancer you&rsquo;ll see down</p><p>27:4X in Louisiana some hot spots that&rsquo;s</p><p>27:4X because of the chemicals in the chemical</p><p>27:5X manufacturing there stomach cancer you</p><p>27:5X sees a lot of red along the Mexican border</p><p>27:5X that&rsquo;s because of hygiene and much more</p><p>27:5X h pylori in among mexicans so we get</p><p>28:0X more stomach cancer prostate cancer is weird</p><p>28:0X you see the red now is shifted more to</p><p>28:0X the northwest and the blue more to the</p><p>28:1X southeast it turns out that both low and</p><p>28:1X high 25 hydroxy vitamin D have about the</p><p>28:1X equal risk for prostate cancer there&rsquo;s</p><p>28:2X some benefit of Von D in fighting</p><p>28:2X aggressive prostate cancer but it turns</p><p>28:2X out that that calcium is an important</p><p>28:3X risk factor for prostate cancer and</p><p>28:3X since one of the benefits of the effects</p><p>28:3X of vitamin D is to increase absorption</p><p>28:3X of calcium it could be that there&rsquo;s a</p><p>28:4X sort of a trade-off between having too</p><p>28:4X much vitamin D and inducing too much</p><p>28:4X calcium absorbtion that may play a role</p><p>28:5X here it&rsquo;s still being debated by the the</p><p>28:5X in the peer review literature I don&rsquo;t</p><p>28:5X have a definitive answer on that but so</p><p>28:5X what I did I got the NASA data for UVB</p><p>29:0X at the surface for July 1992 and you see</p><p>29:0X it&rsquo;s very asymmetrical the the highest</p><p>29:1X rates are in the southwest Arizona New</p><p>29:1X Mexico the lowest rates are northeast</p><p>29:1X and the reason you have higher UVB in</p><p>29:1X the west and an East is that the surface</p><p>29:1X elevation tends to be higher we have</p><p>29:2X more mountains and and even the arm like</p><p>29:2X the Nevada desert is higher than</p><p>29:2X then than a sea level and then you have</p><p>29:2X the westerly winds have to cross the</p><p>29:3X Rocky Mountains and in doing so they</p><p>29:3X pushed the tropopause higher and make</p><p>29:3X the stratospheric ozone layer thinner</p><p>29:3X and it&rsquo;s the ozone in the stratosphere</p><p>29:3X that blocks the UVB so you have less</p><p>29:4X absorption unless scattering in the</p><p>29:4X atmosphere so you have more UVB here in</p><p>29:4X the east you also have more clouds and</p><p>29:5X aerosols which is not reflected in this</p><p>29:5X map but but also plays a role so from</p><p>29:5X ecological studies we found about 15 to</p><p>30:0X 20 types of cancer that are reduced from</p><p>30:0X UVB exposure and we think and we have</p><p>30:1X evidence for a lot of these that higher</p><p>30:1X 25 hydroxy vine D levels are correlated</p><p>30:1X with lower cancer risk</p><p>30:1X so either incidence or mortality rates</p><p>30:2X so it&rsquo;s colon esophageal laryngeal oral</p><p>30:2X pharyngeal rectal small intestine the</p><p>30:2X female cancers breast in the material</p><p>30:3X ovarian and Evolver urogenital bladder</p><p>30:3X kidney prostate and testicular</p><p>30:3X miscellaneous organs gallbladder lung</p><p>30:3X pancreatic and thyroid and the blood</p><p>30:4X cancers lymphoma leukemia non-hodgkins lymphoma</p><p>30:4X now how much vitamin what&rsquo;s the</p><p>30:5X correlation between 25 hydroxy vitamin D</p><p>30:5X and cancer incidence well I made this is</p><p>30:5X sort of a graphical meta-analysis now</p><p>31:0X I&rsquo;ve taken 11 studies from seven</p><p>31:0X countries and merge them together by</p><p>31:1X adjusting the the odds ratio with</p><p>31:1X respect to the 25 hydroxy Von D so</p><p>31:1X they&rsquo;re all laying the same line and now</p><p>31:2X the units here are Nana moles per liter</p><p>31:2X you divide by 2.5 to get nanograms per</p><p>31:2X milliliter so what you see is below</p><p>31:2X about 20 nanograms you get a steep rise</p><p>31:3X in the risk and when you get out to</p><p>31:3X about 40 nano grams you still have some</p><p>31:3X reduced risk but you&rsquo;re slowing down</p><p>31:4X the the the the increase the reduction</p><p>31:4X in odds ratio the the dash dash lines</p><p>31:5X and outside shield a 95% confidence</p><p>31:5X intervals there was this is the</p><p>31:5X uncertainty from the measurements</p><p>32:0X I mean sorry we have a this slope like</p><p>32:0X this and this seems to be typical for</p><p>32:0X other health outcomes as well although</p><p>32:0X for some diseases you may be a threshold</p><p>32:1X at twenty or thirty nanograms more than</p><p>32:1X forty or fifty nanograms like for cancer</p><p>32:1X and now we have results from this was a</p><p>32:2X recent clinical trial conducted into</p><p>32:2X Nebraska with postmenopausal women with</p><p>32:2X an average BMI of about 31 and a</p><p>32:3X baseline 25 hydroxy vitamin D of around</p><p>32:3X 33 nanograms</p><p>32:4X body mass index BMI so these were obese</p><p>32:4X people on average with high 25 hydroxy</p><p>32:4X but indeed there were about a I think</p><p>32:5X was a thousand women involved for four</p><p>32:5X years and they were given $2,000 per day</p><p>33:0X plus about a gram of calcium or placebo</p><p>33:0X or yeah or placebo and it turns out that</p><p>33:1X in the clinical trial in the</p><p>33:1X intention-to-treat they had one more</p><p>33:1X cancer case in the treatment arm then</p><p>33:1X then would be the case if they had less</p><p>33:2X than a one in 20 chance that this was a</p><p>33:2X an effect found by chance there was a P</p><p>33:2X was less P was 0.06 instead of 0.05 and</p><p>33:3X so when the papers published JAMA said</p><p>33:3X on news release saying clinical trial</p><p>33:3X shows that vitamin D does not</p><p>33:3X significantly reduce the risk of cancer</p><p>33:4X but the people at Creighton University</p><p>33:4X along with with people from grassroots</p><p>33:4X health and Keith beggarly said now wait</p><p>33:4X a minute if we look at the serum 2X 33:5X hydroxy of</p><p>33:5X the most the most recent measurement</p><p>33:5X before they developed cancer we find</p><p>33:5X that those that had between 40 and and</p><p>34:0X 80 nanograms per milliliter has</p><p>34:0X significantly reduced risk of cancer</p><p>34:0X compared to those with less than 4 -“</p><p>34:1X nanograms familiar but since they have</p><p>34:1X not specified this as an outcome in the</p><p>34:1X protocol JAMA made them put it in the</p><p>34:1X online appendix the supplementary files</p><p>34:2X which was not seen by most people</p><p>34:2X Creighton University however issued a</p><p>34:2X press release saying see we found a</p><p>34:2X benefit and so we had the two competing</p><p>34:3X press releases and that who have people</p><p>34:3X saw both were a little confused for</p><p>34:3X cardiovascular disease here&rsquo;s another</p><p>34:3X observational study meta-analysis</p><p>34:4X showing that below 20 nanograms per</p><p>34:4X milliliter there&rsquo;s an increased risk of</p><p>34:4X cardiovascular disease unfortunately</p><p>34:4X there have been no clinical trials that</p><p>34:5X have confirmed that giving people</p><p>34:5X vitamin D and reduce the risk of</p><p>34:5X cardiovascular disease so the question</p><p>34:5X is is this maybe because they are out of</p><p>35:0X doors more maybe they&rsquo;re exercising more</p><p>35:0X out of doors maybe they&rsquo;re eating</p><p>35:0X different diet or is there vitamin D</p><p>35:0X maybe it&rsquo;s a long-term vitamin D effect</p><p>35:1X and if you do a two to four year study</p><p>35:1X you don&rsquo;t find the effect so this is</p><p>35:1X still sort of up in the air about</p><p>35:1X cardiovascular disease seasonal</p><p>35:2X influenza dr. John Connell who runs the</p><p>35:2X vitamin D council proposed in 2006 that</p><p>35:2X influenza was largely seasonal due to</p><p>35:3X seasonal variations and UVB doses he had</p><p>35:3X been given being giving his he worked at</p><p>35:3X a task Adaro hospital for the clinically</p><p>35:3X insane he&rsquo;d been giving his patients</p><p>35:4X 5000 IU per day and in 2004-2005 when an</p><p>35:4X influenza epidemic came through the area</p><p>35:4X his patients were largely spared so they</p><p>35:5X got him thinking about well maybe</p><p>35:5X vitamin D does reduce the risk of</p><p>35:5X influenza in fact shortly after his</p><p>35:5X papers published the results of a</p><p>36:0X clinical trial involving postmenopausal</p><p>36:0X women in Long Island was was reanalyzed</p><p>36:0X and they found that indeed those taking</p><p>36:0X $2,000 per day had very few influenza or</p><p>36:1X cold events whereas those taking 800 had</p><p>36:1X several and those taking 400 are you had</p><p>36:1X quite a few so that was one clinical</p><p>36:1X trial that that showed that yes finally</p><p>36:2X done reduce did reduce the risk of</p><p>36:2X influenza and then a one involving</p><p>36:2X Japanese school children show that it</p><p>36:2X reduced type a but not type B influenza</p><p>36:2X I might add that cold temperature and</p><p>36:3X low humidity also in contribute to the</p><p>36:3X seasonality because the influenza virus</p><p>36:3X lives better in a cold dry environment</p><p>36:4X so that&rsquo;s why it can be passed from</p><p>36:4X person to person in the winter but on</p><p>36:4X the other hand it&rsquo;s the volunteers can</p><p>36:4X help you induce Catholic sidon to fight</p><p>36:4X the influenza pregnancy clinical trials</p><p>36:5X in South Carolina found that pregnant</p><p>36:5X women have better pregnancy and birth</p><p>36:5X outcomes by taking 4060 400 IU per day</p><p>36:5X of 1 D 3 and reaching 40 nanograms per</p><p>37:0X milliliter 25 for dr. c ymd the reason</p><p>37:0X is that above 40 nanograms</p><p>37:0X the 125 dihydroxy of vitamin D</p><p>37:1X concentration is stabilized</p><p>37:1X leaving to improve gene expression and</p><p>37:1X there&rsquo;s ever a period of life when gene</p><p>37:1X expressions important is during the</p><p>37:2X fetal development period so the benefits</p><p>37:2X of IMD during pregnancy includes reduced</p><p>37:2X risk of primary c-section delivery on</p><p>37:2X c-section delivery</p><p>37:2X well vaginal delivery is important to</p><p>37:3X give the the infant the the gut biome it</p><p>37:3X needs to to get off to healthy immune</p><p>37:3X start reduced risk of gestational</p><p>37:3X diabetes reduce risk of preterm birth</p><p>37:4X and for the infants reduced risk of low</p><p>37:4X for gestational weight reduced risk of</p><p>37:4X autism and reduced risk of asthma this</p><p>37:5X is from the studies in South Carolina</p><p>37:5X and it&rsquo;s showing that below below twenty</p><p>37:5X six point five nanograms per milliliter</p><p>37:5X there&rsquo;s a reduction in the gestational</p><p>38:0X age above that there seems to be a</p><p>38:0X plateau so here&rsquo;s another benchmark for</p><p>38:0X pregnant women in terms of overall age</p><p>38:1X adjusted mortality rate standard Garlin</p><p>38:1X and company advertised</p><p>38:1X analyzed 32 observational studies and</p><p>38:2X found that it took 36 nanograms per</p><p>38:2X milliliter before the mortality rates</p><p>38:3X plateaued and you see there&rsquo;s a pretty</p><p>38:3X much a linear rise to twice the</p><p>38:3X mortality rate at lower local of 1 -?</p><p>38:4X nanograms familiar as adult mortality so</p><p>38:4X I&rsquo;ve done my own analysis where I looked</p><p>38:5X at disease rates in in various countries</p><p>38:5X and the observational studies for the</p><p>38:5X relationship between 25 hydroxy body and</p><p>39:0X the incidence or mortality rate and</p><p>39:0X found that if everyone well the global</p><p>39:0X average 25 hydroxy varney is around 2 -?</p><p>39:1X nanograms it turns out because of skin</p><p>39:1X pigmentation varying no matter whether</p><p>39:1X you where you live the population</p><p>39:1X average is around 22 nanograms unless</p><p>39:1X you&rsquo;re in the Middle Eastern country and</p><p>39:2X where to any close then it&rsquo;s gonna be</p><p>39:2X lower if you&rsquo;re african-american it&rsquo;s</p><p>39:2X gonna be lower and so on but anyway if</p><p>39:2X you increase from 22 to 44 nanograms it</p><p>39:3X appears that the vitamin d sensitive</p><p>39:3X mortality rate would reduce by about 2 -? percent</p><p>39:3X and that&rsquo;s accounts for about half of a</p><p>39:3X and the deaths and so this would lead to</p><p>39:4X a life expectancy increase in about two years</p><p>39:4X athletic performance again John Cornell</p><p>39:4X wrote a paper I think into 2009 and he</p><p>39:5X went through a number of reasons why he</p><p>39:5X thought that there&rsquo;d be better athletic</p><p>39:5X performance for one thing he point out</p><p>39:5X that the Mexican Olympics 1968 had a lot</p><p>40:0X of World Records and a lot of people had</p><p>40:0X gone there to to practice before had to</p><p>40:0X get used to the altitude he thought it</p><p>40:0X was not the altitude but the UVB and the</p><p>40:1X vitamin D so he published this 2009 in a</p><p>40:1X sports medicine journal and as a result</p><p>40:1X the Chicago Blackhawks became the first</p><p>40:2X vitamin team in modern professional</p><p>40:2X sports became the first time the team in</p><p>40:2X modern professional sports history and</p><p>40:2X according to John sources the Black Hawk</p><p>40:3X team physician became began diagnosing and treating</p><p>40:3X finding efficiency in all blackhawk</p><p>40:3X players about 18 months ago written in</p><p>40:3X 2010 and apparently most players were</p><p>40:4X taking 5,000 IU per day after losing</p><p>40:4X many seasons last year the Blackhawks</p><p>40:4X came out of nowhere to get the Western</p><p>40:4X Conference Finals</p><p>40:4X this year they&rsquo;re playing even better so</p><p>40:5X one thing is going to do is reduce their</p><p>40:5X risk of influenza and Kohl&rsquo;s and all</p><p>40:5X sorts of other respiratory infections</p><p>40:5X the other thing is going to do is reduce</p><p>40:5X the risk of stress fractures another</p><p>41:0X thing a faster healing of wounds so very</p><p>41:0X important</p><p>41:0X Don and I to John also wrote the first</p><p>41:1X paper on vitamin D and the risk of</p><p>41:1X autism I worked with him in 2013 we got</p><p>41:1X the Provost data for children ages 6 to</p><p>41:2X 17 years as a function of state I looked</p><p>41:2X at those versus UVB doses in the summer</p><p>41:2X for the well actually of October and</p><p>41:2X found that there was an inverse</p><p>41:3X correlation between UVB and risk of</p><p>41:3X autism it turns out that African</p><p>41:3X Americans have higher rates of autism</p><p>41:3X than white Americans their darker skin</p><p>41:4X making less vitamin D and there are</p><p>41:4X mechanisms to explain why find D</p><p>41:4X deficiency in both in in in utero and</p><p>41:5X early life would lead to increased risk</p><p>41:5X of autism ADHD it has a pattern which</p><p>42:0X you see the lower rates in the Southwest</p><p>42:0X higher rates in the east and northeast</p><p>42:0X again as sort of looks like the UVB</p><p>42:1X inverse of UVB dental carries it turns</p><p>42:1X out that there were data from the 20s</p><p>42:1X 30s and 40s if I plotted the the the</p><p>42:2X dental health rank versus UVB dose you</p><p>42:2X see that below about 6.5 kilojoules per</p><p>42:3X meter squared there was a linear slope</p><p>42:3X upwards and above that there was a</p><p>42:3X plateau in fact even a paper from 186 -?</p><p>42:3X showed that if you looked at the Union</p><p>42:4X Army soldiers those from Maine and New</p><p>42:4X Hampshire had lost quite a few teeth</p><p>42:4X why time you got to Kentucky or so they</p><p>42:4X had most of T still intact so even then</p><p>42:5X there was an effect of UV on dental health</p><p>42:5X in fact the first clinical trial on</p><p>42:5X vitamin D was for children in England in</p><p>43:0X 1928 giving them body and looking at</p><p>43:0X dental caries and they found that yes</p><p>43:0X they reduce the risk of dental caries</p><p>43:0X and the woman doing this study said that</p><p>43:1X the bacteria were dead</p><p>43:1X she didn&rsquo;t know why but we know why now</p><p>43:1X and this here shows that that there were</p><p>43:1X a number of studies never clinical</p><p>43:2X trials in the 30s and 40s</p><p>43:2X we showed a 50% reduction in dental</p><p>43:2X caries for children taking a vitamin</p><p>43:2X game sleep turns out that raising 2 -?</p><p>43:3X hydroxido into 60 to 70 grams per</p><p>43:3X milliliter does improve sleep however</p><p>43:3X the women doctor gummy enact doing this</p><p>43:3X study found that after two years the</p><p>43:4X people who started reporting systemic</p><p>43:4X pain one of her patients helped her</p><p>43:4X realize that it was because they were</p><p>43:5X becoming a vitamin D vitamin B deficient</p><p>43:5X the back gut bacteria producing finally</p><p>43:5X when you sleep you restore the body</p><p>43:5X through methylation and methylation</p><p>43:5X requires B vitamins and so they&rsquo;re using</p><p>44:0X up some of the vitamins in the gut and</p><p>44:0X when she gave them be 104 which has the</p><p>44:0X multiple beef in a couple months they</p><p>44:0X got the gut back in shape and pain went</p><p>44:1X away and they were fine there&rsquo;s also</p><p>44:1X fine the verbal fluency cognitive decline</p><p>44:1X there&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia</p><p>44:2X this looks like below 20 nanograms</p><p>44:2X there&rsquo;s a problem erectile dysfunction</p><p>44:2X below 20 nanograms per milliliter</p><p>44:3X testosterone there&rsquo;s a study involving</p><p>44:3X obese people in Austria and they found</p><p>44:3X that by giving them vitamin D they did</p><p>44:3X increase their testosterone in fact I&rsquo;ve</p><p>44:4X myself and two other men taking high</p><p>44:4X doses of vitamin D found that when they</p><p>44:4X were up around 60 or 70 nanograms per</p><p>44:4X milliliter that they got the</p><p>44:4X testosterone up so it&rsquo;s a in fact that</p><p>44:5X could help improve athletic performance</p><p>44:5X because testosterone helps muscles</p><p>44:5X surgery turns out that people who go</p><p>45:0X into surgery with higher 25 hydroxy</p><p>45:0X Vandy recover more quickly</p><p>45:0X wounds heal faster burns heal faster so</p><p>45:1X whereas widened D policy headed well we</p><p>45:1X have four or five or six major one D</p><p>45:1X supplementation trials which will</p><p>45:2X complete data collection this year next</p><p>45:2X year and then analyze the results they</p><p>45:2X generally use about 2000 IU per day or</p><p>45:3X $100,000 per month and these studies as</p><p>45:3X imperfect as they are will provide the</p><p>45:3X basis for the next recommendations I was</p><p>45:4X just in Warsaw this is a committee</p><p>45:4X reviewing posters by the mrs. Michael</p><p>45:4X Holick in front looking carefully at</p><p>45:4X that posters so I published a paper</p><p>45:5X recently saying why the clinical trial</p><p>45:5X should be based on vitamin D on 2 -?</p><p>45:5X hydroxy Von D because most the trials</p><p>46:0X are based on the assumptions used for</p><p>46:0X pharmaceutical drugs first of all that</p><p>46:0X the trial is a sole source of the agent</p><p>46:1X and second that there&rsquo;s a linear</p><p>46:1X dose-response relationship between the</p><p>46:1X agent and the health outcome</p><p>46:1X neither assumption is valid for vitamin</p><p>46:2X for vitamin D and also it turns out many</p><p>46:2X of the trials do not follow to measure</p><p>46:2X 25 hydroxy vitamin D they just you know</p><p>46:3X think you take the average healthy</p><p>46:3X person and so they get a healthy person</p><p>46:3X affect that there&rsquo;s no benefit of more</p><p>46:3X vitamin D here we show that from the</p><p>46:4X grassroots health data set that for</p><p>46:4X people taking any reporting that they&rsquo;re</p><p>46:4X taking any value of oral vitamin D that</p><p>46:5X there&rsquo;s about a 50 nanogram spread plus</p><p>46:5X or minus 15 intagram of the 25 hydroxy</p><p>46:5X vitamin D concentration that&rsquo;s why if</p><p>46:5X you really wanna know what your vitamin</p><p>47:0X E level is you gotta have it measured it</p><p>47:0X turns out that why do we need clinical</p><p>47:0X trials well observational studies could be</p><p>47:1X being using the 25 hydroxy of any</p><p>47:1X concentration as an indent of diet or of</p><p>47:1X UVB exposure it turns out for example</p><p>47:2X that meat consumption increases</p><p>47:2X literally from the from the tropics</p><p>47:2X highest consumption racer and the high</p><p>47:2X latitudes if you have mechanisms you</p><p>47:3X don&rsquo;t know how much how important Von D</p><p>47:3X is in reducing risk the health systems</p><p>47:3X most of clinical trials as a gold</p><p>47:3X standard we&rsquo;re now in the evidence-based</p><p>47:3X medicine</p><p>47:3X era as imperfect as it is but they&rsquo;re</p><p>47:4X trying in Budapest there&rsquo;s a lot of meat</p><p>47:4X being sold and so they get to increase</p><p>47:4X the risk of cancer and alt and</p><p>47:5X Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease but they&rsquo;re getting</p><p>47:5X some vitamin D so it&rsquo;s a bit of a</p><p>47:5X trade-off so anyway we&rsquo;re proposing that</p><p>47:5X all these trials be based on 25 hydroxy</p><p>48:0X Von D including the imaging beforehand</p><p>48:0X choosing the participants give enough</p><p>48:0X item D to raise 5 D levels high</p><p>48:0X measuring ans cetera et cetera</p><p>48:1X now why you&rsquo;ve never heard about the</p><p>48:1X whole truth about vitamin D this is from</p><p>48:1X natural news.com well there&rsquo;s the</p><p>48:1X Federal Trade Commission that tells</p><p>48:2X tanning companies they cannot advertise</p><p>48:2X that tanning produces vitamin D big</p><p>48:2X pharma see is that as competition komen</p><p>48:3X Race for the Cure they don&rsquo;t want to</p><p>48:3X cure there they don&rsquo;t want to prevent</p><p>48:3X breast cancer they want to manage for</p><p>48:3X breast cancer the FDA they help sponsor</p><p>48:3X the Institute of Medicine report there&rsquo;s</p><p>48:4X oncologists who make fifty thousand</p><p>48:4X hundred thousand dollars in treating</p><p>48:4X cancer ten dollars a year for vitamin E</p><p>48:4X to prevent cancer no you don&rsquo;t want that</p><p>48:5X and the National Cancer Institute</p><p>48:5X so grassroots well okay I&rsquo;m a co-author</p><p>48:5X on a book coming out shortly called</p><p>49:0X embrace the Sun mark Sorenson is the</p><p>49:0X primary author and dr. T who spoken here</p><p>49:0X before is doing a very careful text</p><p>49:0X editing Michael Holick wrote the</p><p>49:1X foreword for this this should be</p><p>49:1X available in November or December and</p><p>49:1X you can contact me and we can tell you</p><p>49:1X how to get it now for more information go to</p><p>49:2X med which has 27 million health</p><p>49:2X publications listed there you can</p><p>49:3X finally access with scholar.google.com</p><p>49:4X who spends all his waking hours making</p><p>49:4X bundy information accessible finding</p><p>49:4X counsel in nevada new society a society in cancer</p><p>49:5X thank you okay great thank you it&rsquo;s</p><p>49:5X really refreshing to hear someone talk</p><p>49:5X about being in the sun is it really good for you</p><p>50:0X we&rsquo;re gonna push a little bit beyond</p><p>50:0X where we would normally try to stop i</p><p>50:0X want to take a couple of questions if we</p><p>50:0X have them and then we need to start then</p><p>50:1X we can continue yeah after the</p><p>50:1X informally so any question i&rsquo;m for the</p><p>50:1X group here right doesn&rsquo;t heal per day</p><p>50:2X but what are the consequences well the</p><p>50:2X primary consequence of too much of</p><p>50:2X vitamin D is hypercalcemia if you get</p><p>50:3X hypercalcemia you don&rsquo;t feel good and so</p><p>50:3X these people are taking fifty thousand</p><p>50:3X definitely feel fine they do have very</p><p>50:4X high 25 hydroxy Von D concentrations I</p><p>50:4X guess we&rsquo;ll just have to see what happens</p><p>50:4X it stores though the same 50,000 a year</p><p>50:5X saying but if you took it yeah if you</p><p>50:5X took it once a week or hmm</p><p>50:5X yeah the vitamin E can store in the fat</p><p>51:0X and the muscles the 25 has a short</p><p>51:0X half-life I&rsquo;m hoping you would ask a</p><p>51:0X question first of all thank you for your</p><p>51:1X contributions to the scientific</p><p>51:1X community second of all so I have my</p><p>51:1X understanding is UVB is the best from 1 -?</p><p>51:1X a.m. to 4 p.m. and what would you</p><p>51:2X recommend like 20 to 25 minutes in the</p><p>51:2X sunlight well more like 10 to – ?</p><p>51:2X and it depends on how much skin you can</p><p>51:3X expose and your skin pigmentation so if</p><p>51:3X you&rsquo;re fair-skinned and mixed pros let&rsquo;s</p><p>51:3X say a young person exposing 10% of his</p><p>51:4X body can maybe make after you 20 or 30 I</p><p>51:4X you per per minute maybe so maybe 25 to</p><p>51:4X 15 minutes for a young person it might</p><p>51:5X be enough but if you can expose a</p><p>51:5X quarter of your body that&rsquo;s better you</p><p>51:5X cut down the time there are there are</p><p>51:5X UVB meters out that tell you how much</p><p>52:0X time you has been made thank you I&rsquo;ll</p><p>52:0X check that out okay one more quick okay</p><p>52:0X so that&rsquo;s Daly but if you only get out</p><p>52:1X once a week but you&rsquo;re out for six to</p><p>52:1X ten hours and the half-life is long</p><p>52:1X enough you can get enough that way also</p><p>52:1X correct yeah you can make twenty</p><p>52:2X thousand in a day so and you can store</p><p>52:2X the X and the half-life is two and a</p><p>52:2X half weeks and you can store the excess</p><p>52:2X vitamin D so that would probably do okay</p><p>52:3X that&rsquo;s good do you mind go ahead and ask</p><p>52:3X your question one on one or the one</p><p>52:4X where the people are taking and then</p><p>52:4X they&rsquo;re measuring the dosages about four</p><p>52:4X from the end or so is that published</p><p>52:4X somewhere that seems like a really</p><p>52:5X important okay we&rsquo;ll go ahead why don&rsquo;t</p><p>53:0X you go ahead and finish this one yeah</p><p>53:0X let&rsquo;s complete the evening thank you all</p><p>53:0X for coming we meet the third Thursday of</p><p>53:1X every month you</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>asthma</span>
