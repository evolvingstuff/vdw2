**A friend got a reaction to a wasp sting which spread across her hand.  
She applied vitamin D topically (10,000 IU) and the pain went way for about 4 hours  
<span style="color:#00F;">Comment by founder of VitaminDWiki</span>  
Topical Vitamin D lasts ~ 4 hours on the skin before it is carried away by the blood  
Need to apply vitamin D frequently.   
Just as a single aspirin does not last all day, a single topical Vitamin D dose does not help for a long time**

 **Fewer allergic reactions if higher levels of vitamin D**
