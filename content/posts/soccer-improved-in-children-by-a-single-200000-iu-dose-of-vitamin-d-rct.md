This randomized controlled trial aimed to test whether vitamin D (VD) supplementation affects measures of physical performance in VD-insufficient mildly trained children. Thirty-six recreationally soccer player boys were randomly assigned to single dose (200,000 IU) of VD3 (n=19) or placebo (n=17). Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) was assessed and measures of physical performance (i.e. vertical and standing broad jumps, triple hop, 10-m and 30-m sprints, shuttle run) were performed before and 12 weeks after the loading dose. Mixed ANCOVA models were performed and effect size was estimated by partial eta squared (ηp2). Baseline 25-OHD and physical variables were equivalent in the two groups. Twelve weeks after VD loading, plasma 25-OHD increased and physical variables improved in VD group, only. 

There was a significant interaction effects for group by time for 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| vertical jump  | (F=14.9, p=0.001, ηp2=0.394) |
| triple hop jump  | (F=24.2, p<0.001, ηp2=0.513) |
| 10-m sprint  | (F=4.46, p=0.046, ηp2=0.162)  |
| 30-m sprint | (F=6.56, p=0.017, ηp2=0.222)  |
| shuttle run  | F=13.4, p=0.001, ηp2=0.369).  |

 

In conclusion, a single bolus of VD3 resulted in significant improvements in jumping ability, agility, and running speed in VD-insufficient mildly trained children. The findings suggest that correcting VD deficit might be beneficial for physical performance. 

• A mega dose of vitamin D3 improves jumping ability, agility, and running speed in VD-insufficient mildly trained children 

• Effect of vitamin D on measures of physical performance is noticeable three months after the loading dose.
