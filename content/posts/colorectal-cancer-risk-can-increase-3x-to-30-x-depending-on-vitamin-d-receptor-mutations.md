Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly occurring neoplasias in humans. The prevalence of CRC rates is still rising. Although the exact background of the disease still remains unknown, it is believed that CRC may not only be a result of environmental factors, but also genetic ones. One of the mechanisms underlying CRC might be the vitamin D pathway, as CRC is the most closely linked neoplasia to vitamin D deficiency. This study shows a possible association of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI with CRC susceptibility. A total of 103 patients diagnosed with CRC (61 men and 42 women, aged 57–82 years) and 109 healthy people (50 men and 59 women, aged 47–68 years) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP for FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI. None of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) individually increased or decreased the risk of CRC. The evaluation of haplotypes revealed two that might enhance the likelihood of CRC development: taB (OR = 30.22; 95% CI 2.81–325.31; p = 0.01) and tAb (OR = 3.84; 95% CI 1.29–11.38; p = 0.01). In conclusion, genotyping is an easy and robust procedure that needs to be performed only once in a lifetime. A creation of a relevant SNP’s panel might contribute to the identification of the groups that are at the greatest risk of CRC.
