Vitamin-D supplementation in vitamin-D insufficient/deficient prediabetes individuals is associated with significantly lower progression to diabetes (6/55 vs. 13/49; p=0.04) and higher reversal to normoglycemia (23/55 vs. 10/49; p=0.02), associated with decreased insulin resistance and systemic inflammation (TNFÎ± and IL6). Baseline vitamin-D and 2h blood glucose independently predicted progression to diabetes.
