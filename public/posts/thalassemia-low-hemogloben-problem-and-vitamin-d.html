To evaluate the prevalence and the performance of routine surveillance for thalassemia related complications during 2 periods; before and after published CPGs (2012-2014 vs 2015-2017), data from 524 adult thalassemia patients attended at Siriraj hospital were compared among different treating physician groups; thalassemia, private hematology, and internal medicine clinics. Three most common complications were osteopenia/osteoporosis (69.8%), gallstones (67.6%) and abnormal vitamin D level (67.6%). Iron overload has been widely evaluated (93.1%) followed by liver function test (82.3%). However, the rate of evaluation for other complications were significantly reduced and &lt; 25% of patients were evaluated in several complications. Comparing among clinics, the surveillance rate has increased significantly for several endocrine complications only in patients treated at thalassemia clinic but not in others. This study was the first study that evaluated real-world practical management of thalassemia patient in terms of complication surveillance. This different clinical practice has called for an immediate policy change to improve and standardize a care for thalassemia patients in Thailand.</p><hr><h4 id=thalassemia-major-associated-with-bone-problems-need-vitamin-d---2013>Thalassemia Major associated with bone problems, need Vitamin D - 2013</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Status in Thalassemia Major: an Update</strong></p><p>Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2013; 5(1): e2013057.

Genetics research found that BsmI polymorphism region in VDR gene relates to osteoporosis, other bone diseases, and cartilage metabolism in particular allele. The aim of this research is to analyze polymorphism of VDR (825G/T) gene in the eighth intron of beta thalassemia major on Sundanese population. In this case-control study, SNP 825G/T of 66 beta thalassemia major patients (case group) and 15 controls (control group) were evaluated using PCR-RFLP with restriction of enzyme BsmI. Vitamin D and calcium level were analyzed using ELISA. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies were analyzed chisquared test.</p><p>This study found that the vitamin D level was significantly lower on case group than on control group (vitamin D 56.1 pmol/L 80.30%; p&lt;0.001), and calcium level was significantly higher on case group than on control group (>8.5 mg/dL; p=0.025).</p><p>Genotype frequency 825 VDR on case group was compared with control group, and there was no BB genotype in control group. There is only one case on case group (OR, 2.63; 95%CI, 0.73-9.64). B allele is significant in both case and control groups. There was no significant difference between case and control groups (OR, 2, 95%CI, 0.71-5.92).

Annual nutritional laboratory testing should include albumin, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, fasting glucose, fasting plasma zinc, serum copper, ceruloplasmin, serum selenium, alpha and gamma tocopherol, plasma ascorbate, and serum folate. (See nutrition table below.)</p><p>Recommendations for dietary supplementation should be made as indicated by nutritional history, complications of the disease, and, in children, growth status. Typically multivitamin supplementation without iron is suggested (e.g., Centrum Silver in tablet or chewable form is now available).</p><p>For nontransfused thalassemia patients, folate supplementation (1 mg daily) is recommended, and consuming a moderately low-iron diet is encouragedâ€”that is, avoiding iron-fortified cereals and other products and excessive consumption of red meat. Drinking black tea with meals is recommended to reduce iron absorption from food.</p><p>For transfused patients on chelation therapy, a low-iron diet is unnecessary and may decrease the quality of life for some patients. The amount of iron obtained from just one unit of packed red cells (200 mg) far outweighs the amount of iron obtained from a 3-ounce steak (5 mg).</p><p><strong>Vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU once a week until levels normalize)</strong> is recommended for patients with a 25-hydroxy vitamin D less than 20 ng/dL. Calcium supplementation should be encouraged if dietary intake is insufficient.</p><p>Counseling should be offered for patients with special dietary needs. These include patients with diabetes or lactose intolerance, those who practice vegetarianism, those who are pregnant, or those on oral chelators or bisphosphonate medications.</p><p>Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are to be discouraged. Alcohol potentiates the oxidative damage of iron and aggravates the effect of hepatitis B and C on liver tissue. Cigarette smoking affects bone remodeling and is associated with osteoporosis.</p><hr><h4 id=thalessemia-major-children-have-16-ng-of-vitamin-d---july-2019>Thalessemia Major children have 16 ng of vitamin D - July 2019</h4><p><strong>Study of Vitamin D Levels in Thalessemia Major Patients in Children</strong></p><p>J of Medical Science and clinical Research Vol 07 Issue 07 July 2019 DOI: <a href=https://dx.doi.org/10.18535/jmscr/v7i7.49>https://dx.doi.org/10.18535/jmscr/v7i7.49</a></p><p>Shruti Dhale, Subash Valinjkar, Jyothi Janardhanan, Sagar Walhekar</p><p>Introduction: <strong>Thalassemia is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin synthesis.</strong> Regular blood transfusions and chelation therapy have noticeably prolonged survival in thalassemic patients.<sup>[1]</sup> Despite a significant increase in the lifespan of these patients, they suffer from multiple abnormalities <strong>probably due to iron overload</strong> , including endocrinal abnormalities such as</p><ul><li><p>hypogonadism,</p></li><li><p>diabetes mellitus,</p></li><li><p>hypothyroidism and</p></li><li><p>hypoparathyroidism.<sup>[2]</sup> The pattern of levels of vitamin D levels among the patients with thalassemia major undergoing repeated blood transfusions remain unexplored.
