However, a recent cohort study found no relation between circulating ω3-PUFA levels and pregnancy rates after ART.</p><p>STUDY DESIGN SIZE, AND DURATION</p><p>This analysis included a random sample of 100 women from a prospective cohort study (EARTH) at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center who underwent 136 ART cycles within one year of blood collection.</p><p>PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS</p><p>Serum fatty acids (expressed as percentage of total fatty acids) were measured by gas chromatography in samples taken between Days 3 and 9 of a stimulated cycle. Primary outcomes included the probability of implantation, clinical pregnancy and live birth per initiated cycle. Cluster-weighted generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to analyze the association of total and specific PUFAs with ART outcomes adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking status, physical activity, use of multivitamins and history of live birth.</p><p>MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE</p><p>The median <span>[25th, 75th percentile]</span> serum level of ω3-PUFA was 4.7% <span>[3.8%, 5.8%]</span> of total fatty acids. Higher levels of serum long-chain ω3-PUFA were associated with higher probability of clinical pregnancy and live birth. Specifically, after multivariable adjustment, the probability of clinical pregnancy and live birth increased by 8% (4%, 11%) and 8% (95% CI: 1%, 16%), respectively, for every 1% increase in serum long-chain ω3-PUFA levels. Intake of long-chain ω3-PUFA was also associated with a higher probability of life birth in these women, with RR of 2.37 (95% CI: 1.02, 5.51) when replacing 1% energy of long-chain ω3-PUFA for 1% energy of saturated fatty acids. Serum ω6-PUFA, ratios of ω6 and ω3-PUFA, and total PUFA were not associated with ART outcomes.</p><p>LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION</p><p>The generalizability of the findings to populations not undergoing infertility treatment may be limited. The use of a single measurement of serum fatty acids to characterize exposure may lead to potential misclassification during follow up.</p><p>WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS</p><p>Serum ω3-PUFA are considered biomarkers of dietary intake. The association of higher serum long chain ω3-PUFA levels with improved ART outcomes suggests that increased intake of these fats be may be beneficial for women undergoing infertility treatment with ART.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/omega-3-2017.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=big-benefits-to-infant-if-mother-with-gestational-diabetes-took-omega-3-for-6-weeks--march-2015>Big benefits to infant if mother with Gestational Diabetes took Omega-3 for 6 weeks – March 2015</h3><p><strong>Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation affects pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</strong></p><p>Matern Fetal Neonatal Med. 2015 Mar 9:1-7</p><p>Jamilian M1, Samimi M, Kolahdooz F, Khalaji F, Razavi M, Asemi Z.</p><p>Objective: This study was designed to assess the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on inflammatory factors, biomarkers of oxidative stress, and pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM).</p><p>Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed among 56 women with GDM.

We planned to evaluate the effect of omega-3 on: preterm birth (PTB); pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); gestational diabetes; perinatal mortality; small for gestational age (SGA) and birth weight; infant eye and brain development; and postpartum depression.</p><p>Results: We identified 34 RCTs including 14 106 singletons and 2578 twins. These level-1 data showed that omega-3 was not associated with prevention of PTB, PE, IUGR, gestational diabetes, SGA, post-partum depression or better children development. Data about birth weight, perinatal mortality and childhood cognitive outcome were limited. Women with gestational diabetes who received omega-3 had significantly lower serum C-reactive protein concentrations, low incidence of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns and decreased newborns’ hospitalization rate.</p><p>Conclusions: There was not enough evidence to support the routine use of omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy. <strong>Given the 73% significant decrease in perinatal death in the singleton gestations who started omega-3 supplementation ≤ 20 weeks</strong> , further research is needed.

There is a need for effective, easily available, safe and acceptable interventions to prevent preterm delivery, especially before 34 weeks of gestation. Omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA (eicosapentanoic acid) and DHA (docosahexanoic acid) are available as over the counter nutritional supplements, and are taken by women to improve pregnancy outcomes, without any clear recommendations. We undertook a systematic review to assess the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on early (&lt;34 weeks) and any (&lt;37 weeks) preterm delivery.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library from inception to 2014 without any language restrictions. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were done by two independent reviewers. Results were summarized as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Of the nine included trials (5980 women), six (4193 women) evaluated the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on early preterm delivery. The <strong>risk of early preterm delivery was reduced by 58%</strong> (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.27-0.66; I(2)=0%; p=0.0002) and any preterm delivery by 17% (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70-0.98; I(2)=0%; p=0.03) with the intervention. There was a <strong>significant increase in the mean gestational age by 1.95 weeks</strong> (95% CI 0.42-3.48 weeks; I(2)=0.47; p=0.01) and mean birth weight by 122.1g (95% CI 47.4-196.8; I(2)=0.84; p=0.001) in the intervention group compared to the controls.

Whether maternal LC-PUFA status during pregnancy affects risk of problem behavior in later childhood is unclear.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>Within a population-based cohort, we measured maternal plasma docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations and n-3:n-6-ratio in mid-pregnancy. Child emotional and behavioral problems at 6 y of age were assessed by parents (child behavior checklist), teachers (teacher report form), and combined parent/teacher report.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Higher maternal DHA and n-3:n-6 ratio were associated with fewer child emotional problems using parent (odds ratio (OR)DHA = 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70, 0.96; P = 0.02 and ORn-3:n-6 = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.96; P = 0.01; n = 5,307) and combined parent/teacher scores (ORDHA = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.95; P = 0.01 and ORn-3:n-6 = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.92; P &lt; 0.01; n = 2,828).</p><p>Higher AA was associated with more child behavioral problems using teacher (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.20; P = 0.04; n = 3,365) and combined parent/teacher scores (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.22; P = 0.02; n = 2,827). Maternal EPA was not associated with child problem behavior.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Indications of associations of maternal LC-PUFA status with child emotional and behavioral problems were found.
