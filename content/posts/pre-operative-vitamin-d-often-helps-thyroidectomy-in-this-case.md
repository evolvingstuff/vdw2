#### Use of pre-operative calcium and vitamin D supplementation to prevent post-operative hypocalcaemia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy: a systematic review

 **<span style="color:#F00;">The amount of vitamin D given depends on the patient and the reason for the surgery</span>  
200,000 IU taken over a period of 2 -20 days is typical  
The Vitamin D should be taken at least 1 week before so that the levels have fully responded  
Giving vitamin D as the day of the surgery is not as good as given before, but is better than none at all  
A different form of Vitamin D can be given if the person has poor gut, poor liver, or poor kidney**

Objective: This systematic review aimed to establish the evidence behind the use of pre-operative calcium, vitamin D or both calcium and vitamin D to prevent post-operative hypocalcaemia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.

Method: This review included prospective clinical trials on adult human patients that were published in English and which studied the effects of pre-operative supplementation with calcium, vitamin D or both calcium and vitamin D on the rate of post-operative hypocalcaemia following total thyroidectomy.

Results: Seven out of the nine trials included reported statistically significantly reduced rates of post-operative laboratory hypocalcaemia (absolute risk reduction, 13-59 per cent) and symptomatic hypocalcaemia (absolute reduction, 11-40 per cent) following pre-operative supplementation.

Conclusion: Pre-operative treatment with calcium, vitamin D or both calcium and vitamin D reduces the risk of post-operative hypocalcaemia and should be considered in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy.
