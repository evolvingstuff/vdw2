#### [The Price of Zika? About $4 Million Per Child](http://www.wired.com/2016/08/price-zika-4-million-per-child/%20) Wired Aug 2016

* Cost of pregnancy in states with Zika outbreaks will climb when you figure in the two rounds of Zika testing and monthly serial ultrasounds the CDC recommends for monitoring.

* “A very, very conservative guess would be that the  **medical costs**  of Zika would be around $600,000 for these families,”

> special schooling

> modify their home and vehicles

> loss of income for parents providing round-the-clock care.

1. I can relate. My 104 year-old father-in -aw takes a lot of daily care

> about 6 hours of my time

> and 6 hours of care-givers (@ $25/hours ==> $54,000/year)

1. Probably the mother does not even have to be a US citizen – just have the birth in US and her birth defected child remain in the US

1. Rough estimate 900 microcephalic children to increase Florida's Medicaid cost by 1%

> Medicad Florida $9 billion annually

> 1% of annual = $90 million

> $100,000 = rough guess of annual cost per child (assumes that Medicad does not pay for care-giving)

> 900 children = 1% addition
