### 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vitamin D deficiency in children with rheumatologic disorders and controls.

J Rheumatol. 2011 Sep;38(9):2000-4. Epub 2011 Jul 15.

Pelajo CF, Lopez-Benitez JM, Miller LC.

Department of Pediatric Rheumatology, Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. cpelajo@tuftsmedicalcenter.org

OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, as well as factors associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span&gt;[25(OH)D]&lt;/span&gt; levels, in children attending a pediatric rheumatology clinic, and to determine whether there was a difference in serum 25(OH)D levels and in vitamin D deficiency between children with autoimmune disorders and nonautoimmune conditions.

METHODS:

Cross-sectional analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels of patients between the ages of 2 and 19 years, seen between November 2008 and October 2009.

RESULTS:

A total of 254 patients were studied (169 autoimmune disorders, 85 nonautoimmune conditions). 

The mean age of study patients was 12.3 years; 67% were female and 80% were white. 

In the autoimmune disorders group, 23% had vitamin D deficiency [serum 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/ml](serum%2025(OH)D%20&lt;%2020%20ng/ml), and in the nonautoimmune conditions group 14% were vitamin D deficient. 

The average level of serum 25(OH)D was 28.6 (± 11) ng/ml (range 2 to 59). 

Age, ethnicity, body mass index, use of supplements, and season were significantly associated with serum levels of 25(OH)D (all p ? 0.02). 

The OR of patients with autoimmune disorders being vitamin D deficient was  **2.3** , in relation to patients with nonautoimmune conditions (p = 0.04).

CONCLUSION:

Twenty percent of patients attending a pediatric rheumatology clinic were vitamin D deficient. 

Patients with autoimmune disorders were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than patients with nonautoimmune conditions. 

Screening of serum 25(OH)D levels should be performed for patients with autoimmune disorders.

PMID: 21765107
