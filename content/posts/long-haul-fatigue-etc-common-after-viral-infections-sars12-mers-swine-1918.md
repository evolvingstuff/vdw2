### Summary

* Some people have long-term health problems after any viral infection

* The exact fraction of people varies with the virus - varies from 10% to 60%

* The long-term problems can extend for months to years.

   * Sometimes the damage is permanent - example = lungs

* It is too early (Aug ) to know if long-term COVID-19 problems will last for more than 3 months

* The long-term problems occur without having had serious symptoms

* It appears that long-term COVID-19 problems favor women and those of middle age 

   * vs COVID-19 favors men and elderly

* The most common long-term problem is Chronic Fatigue

   * Note to Athletes: Exercise can make Chronic Fatigue symptoms worse

#### Vitamin D might help viral infections in many ways

* Reduce the risk of getting any enveloped viral infection

* Reduce the risk of getting a severe infection

* Normalize the immune system which has locked-on, which results in long-term problems

* [Vitamin D can inhibit most enveloped virus](/posts/vitamin-d-can-inhibit-enveloped-virus-eg-corona-herpes-bird-flu-epstein-hepatitis-rsv-etc)

* Additional enveloped virus include: Epstein-Barr virus- Mononucleosis, Ebola, cold sore, Shingles, cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis B, HIV, Dengue, Yellow fever, Measles, Mumps, smallpox, 

   * and all previous Coronavirus, such as SARS, MERS (no data yet on SARS-2 - too new)

* [Swine Flu Influenza (H1N1) of 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic) Wikipedia

   * Infected ~1 Billion, Killed ~284,000

   * "Referred to as long-haul Covid, longcovid, or tentatively by the medical community as ‘post-Covid syndrome’,.."

   * "	Recent analysis by the Covid Symptom Study suggested that as many as  **one in 10 people**  with Covid-19 have been sick for more than three weeks after symptoms first emerge. Some of the most pernicious problems faced by the group of long-haulers are chronic fatigue, high temperature, insomnia, headaches, brain fog, tingling sensations and dizziness."

   * "	John Geddes, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, believes that protracted illness is likely to be caused by the virus getting into the nerve cells of the brain. Others suggest that an elevated immune response to the virus may be damaging the cells in key parts of the body."

   * " Following the 2003 Sars outbreak in Asia, researchers found that  **60 per cent**  of patients had post-viral fatigue and insomnia  **one year**  after contracting the virus. "

   * "	The Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014 led to the identification of a unique “post-Ebola Syndrome”, which shared some symptoms with chronic fatigue and  **lasted up to two years**  after infection. "

   * COVID-19 support groups show that there are many people not considered sick enough to be hospitalized – yet they are experiencing symptoms worse than the flu. It is possible COVID-19 is neurotoxic and is one of the first illnesses capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. This might explain why many people like me have neurological problems. Many long-haulers are experiencing post-viral symptoms similar to those caused by mononucleosis and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.

   * A big challenge long-haulers face may be sustaining employment. Ultimately, it is too early to classify long-haulers as having a disability. Anthony Fauci reported that “it will take months to a year or more to know whether lingering COVID-19 symptoms in young people could be chronic illnesses.”

   * Influenza has long been linked to persistent symptoms such as fatigue and muscle pain, 

      * including after both the 1890 and 1918-19 pandemics.

   * Survival of a severe viral pneumonia or ARDS, particularly after intensive care, is known to have long-lasting implications. Some survivors suffer long-term breathlessness and fatigue as a result of the damage to their lungs or from other complications. Survivors can also suffer depression (26–33%), anxiety (38–44%), or post-traumatic stress disorder (22–24%).

   * Canadian researchers followed survivors of the first  **SARS**  outbreak in Toronto. They found sleep disturbance, chronic fatigue, depression and muscle pains were common. A third of survivors had to modify their work and lifestyle, and  **only 14% had no long-term symptoms** . 

   * Similarly, in a Korean group of  **MERS**  survivors,  **48% still experienced chronic fatigue after 12 months**

   * Some potential treatments we have learned from management of fatigue syndrome/fibromyalgia/myalgic encephalomyelitis syndrome that may be transferrable to post-COVID patients are:

      * 1. Energy support for severe fatigue: CoQ10, ashwaganda, ginseng, DHEA, high potency B vitamins, carnitine and hormones.

      * 2. Immune support: Vitamins C,  **D** , zinc, mushroom extract, probiotics, sleep and stress management.

      * 3. Inflammation: anti-inflammatory diet, Zyflamend, fish oil,  **turmeric and ginger**  (activate VDR).

      * 4. Pain management, mood and brain issues: cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, meditation, graded mental and physical rehabilitation exercises, acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, SAMe, ginkgo, cannabinoids, magnesium and medications.

* [dysautonomia](https://mcdonaldandmcdonald.com/2018/05/09/long-term-disability-autonomic-dysfunction-or-dysautonomia/): heart, brain, gastrointestinal and immune systems.
