#### Nutrition availability for those incarcerated in jail: Implications for mental health

Int J Prison Health . 2022 Aug 4 [doi: 10.1108/IJPH-02-2022-0009.](https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-02-2022-0009.)

Purpose: Using a seven-day cycle menu and commissary items at a rural county jail, this study aims to describe provisions of micronutrients known to be associated with mental health disorders and if they meet dietary guidelines.

Design/methodology/approach: The nutritional content of a seven-day cycle menu and four available commissary food packs were evaluated using NutritionCalc® Plus software (McGraw-Hill Education version 5.0.19) and compared to Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).

Findings: Menu mean values of Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C and zinc met DRI recommendations. 

However, 

* Vitamin D (for men and women), 

* magnesium (for men only) and 

* omega-3s (for men only) did not meet the DRI recommendations.

Originality/value: As deficits of Vitamin D, magnesium and omega-3s are known to exacerbate bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression, small changes to food would increase the offerings and potential intake of nutrients that may improve mental health.
