#### Observation by Henry Lahore, founder of VitaminDWiki

I have been tracking simple Vitamin D testers for over 4 years 

Many candidate designs have come and gone.

It appears to be a very difficult problem

The only group which I am aware of which has a chance at getting this prize is Nanospeed

My review of their development is [Low-cost Vitamin D testers (two yes-no tests for 11 dollars) - 2024](/posts/low-cost-vitamin-d-testers-two-yes-no-tests-for-11-dollars-2024)

They currrently have a low cost tester which requires an expensive readout device.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Would be OK for use iin pharmacies, but not in the home

It appears feasible to use a smartphone(with camera)  as no-cost readout device

I am sending them a link to this prize
