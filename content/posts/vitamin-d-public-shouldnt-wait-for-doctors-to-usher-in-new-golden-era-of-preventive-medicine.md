### Bill Sardi does not premit the reposting of his [excellent material](http://knowledgeofhealth.com/vitamin-d-public-shouldnt-wait-for-doctors-to-usher-in-new-golden-era-of-preventive-medicine/)  Aug 2014

 **However, here are his section headings** 

Vitamin D: the moral test for modern medicine

What is a healthy blood level?

Vitamin D shortage: dark-skinned individuals suffer most

Universal blood testing

What about risk of overdosing?

Latest vitamin D science is compelling

Test a whole country

Big Pharma likely to drag its feet

Expect to hear about negative to null studies

Humanity took a giant step backwards when penicillin was first adopted

A culture in modern medicine that shuns vitamin therapy

What dosage?

Will the public adopt vitamin D? Don’t count on it

Real progress in modern medicine
