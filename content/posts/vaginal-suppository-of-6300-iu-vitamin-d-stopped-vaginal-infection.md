INTRODUCTION: We evaluated data of 200 patients with  **chronical recurrent cervical infections**  despite adequate treatment (=primary antibiotic/antimycotic treatment according to the antibiogram and secondary vaginal lactobacillus treatment): 100 of them with chronical bacterial and/or fungal infections had no dysplasia. 100 of them with chronical bacterial and/or fungal infections had dysplasia (50 with a CIN I and 50 with a CIN 2). 43 of the 50 CIN I patients (=86%) and 46 of the 50 CIN II patients (= 92%) had high risk HPV.

METHODS: The patients got a high-dose vaginal vitamin D treatment  **(12,500 IU, 3 nights a week, for 6 weeks).** 

RESULTS: Vitamin D serum levels: we could find that  **obviously vitamin D is reabsorbed by the vaginal mucosa** . Before treatment, 100 patients (=50%) had insufficient vitamin D serum values (<30 ng/ml). After treatment, 58 of these 100 patients (=58%) had adequate vitamin D serum values (30-50 ng/ml). In our anamnesis after 6 weeks of treatment,  **most of the patients subjectively declared to have less vaginal infections, less discharge and sexual intercourse problems** . 

This we could also find objectively 6 weeks after the treatment. 

Cervicitis and no dysplasia group: after 6 weeks of treatment, only 7% still had a bacterial and/or fungal cervicitis  **(=success rate 93%)** . 

The treatment also seems to have longer time effects. After 6 months of treatment, more than 80% had no bacterial and/or fungal cervicitis. 

 **Cervicitis and CIN I group** : After 6 weeks of treatment, only 10% still had a bacterial and/or fungal cervicitis. **<span style="color:#00F;">Success rate was 90%</span>** . 21 of 43 patients (=49%) still had high risk of HPV, and the success rate was 51%. 24 patients (=48%) were free of dysplastic cells (PAP II or PAP I, only 2 of the 24 patients still had high risk HPV). 26 patients (=52%) still had a CIN I <span>[19 of them (36%) had high risk HPV]</span>, and the success rate was 48%. 

 **Cervicitis and CIN II group** : after 6 weeks of treatment, 8 of the 50 patients (16%) still had a bacterial and/or fungal cervicitis, and the  **<span style="color:#00F;">success rate was 84%</span>** . 38 of 46 patients (=83%) still had high risk HPV, and the success rate was 17%. 9 patients (=18%) were free of dysplastic cells (PAP II or PAP I, 7 of the 9 patients were free of high risk HPV) and 44% had a better result (CIN I, 5 of the 22 patients were free of high risk HPV). 24 patients still had a CIN II (all of them still had high risk HPV), and the success rate was 62% (very successful 18%, successful 44%).

CONCLUSION: When compared with the ineffective lactobacillus vaginal suppositories, the high-dose vitamin D vaginal suppositories were effective. 

Most of the 200 patients subjectively and objectively had benefit. 

The high-dose vitamin D vaginal treatment might be an option for the therapy and prophylaxis of chronical cervical infections and of a dysplasia of the cervix uteri (CIN 1, CIN 2).

#### Vaginal D & E helped a lot after breast cancer - April 2019

 **The effect of vitamin D and E vaginal suppositories on tamoxifen-induced vaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer** 

Supportive Care in Cancer, April 2019, Volume 27, Issue 4, pp 1325–1334  DOI https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-019-04684-6

Purpose

Vaginal atrophy is one of the most common side effects of using tamoxifen in women with breast cancer. Hormone therapy for vaginal atrophy is prohibited in these women. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of vitamin D and E vaginal suppositories on vaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen.

Methods

Women under breast cancer management receiving tamoxifen and showing symptoms of vaginal atrophy were randomized triple-blind to an 8-week trial on vaginal suppository vitamin E or vitamin D or placebo administered every night before bedtime. The genitourinary atrophy self-assessment tool was administered, and pH was measured in all three groups before the intervention and at the end of weeks 2, 4, and 8 of the intervention. The Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) was also measured before the intervention and at the end of the eighth week. Data were analyzed with paired t tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and chi-square test.

Results

Thirty-two patients were randomized in each group. The results obtained showed an increase in the VMI by the end of the eighth week of the intervention in the groups receiving the vitamin D and E vaginal suppositories compared with the placebo group (P < 0.001). The vaginal pH also reduced in both groups compared with that in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The symptoms of self-reported genitourinary atrophy also improved in the two intervention groups compared with those in the placebo group by the end of the eighth week (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data support that vitamin D and E vaginal suppositories were beneficial in improving vaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. Given the prohibition on hormone therapy in these women, the suppositories can be used as an alternative therapy to improve these symptoms.
