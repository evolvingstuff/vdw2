 **The Supreme Court held in Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905) that the right to refuse medical treatment could be overcome when society needs to curb the spread of a contagious epidemic. At Friday's oral argument, all the <span>[Supreme Court]</span> justices acknowledged that the federal mandates rest on this rationale.** 

 **But mandating a vaccine to stop the spread of a disease requires evidence that the vaccines will prevent infection or transmission (rather than efficacy against severe outcomes like hospitalization or death).** 

 **As the World Health Organization puts it, 'if mandatory vaccination is considered necessary to interrupt transmission chains and prevent harm to others, there should be sufficient evidence that the vaccine is efficacious in preventing serious infection and/or transmission.'6 For Omicron, there is as yet no such evidence. The little data we have suggest the opposite."**
