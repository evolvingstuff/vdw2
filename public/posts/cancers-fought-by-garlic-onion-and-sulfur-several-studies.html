There is limited evidence on the association between onion and garlic intake and breast cancer. We assessed this association in a population-based, case-control study in Puerto Rico. Incident, primary breast cancer cases (n = 314) were identified among women aged 30–79 from hospital and clinic records. Controls (n = 346) were women with no history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, residents of the same area. Dietary intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. Total onion and garlic intake included sofrito (a popular garlic- and onion-based condiment) intake frequency. Unconditional logistic regression assessed the association between onion and garlic consumption and breast cancer adjusting for age, education, parity, family history, body mass index, age at menarche, total energy, and smoking. Inverse associations with breast cancer were observed for moderate (OR (odds ratio) = 0.59, 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.35, 1.01) and high consumption (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.87) compared to low consumption of onion and garlic (Ptrend = 0.02). Results were similar when stratified by menopausal status. Study results suggest that high onion and garlic consumption is protective against breast cancer in this population.</p><hr><h4 id=garlic-componds-reduce-the-risk-of-breast-cancer---april-2022>Garlic componds reduce the risk of Breast Cancer - April 2022</h4><p><strong>Diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide in garlic as novel therapeutic agents to overcome drug resistance in breast cancer</strong></p><p>Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis Volume 12, Issue 2, April 2022, Pages 221-231 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2021.11.004>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2021.11.004</a> FREE PDF</p><p>Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. It is a cancer that originates from the mammary ducts and involves mutations in multiple genes. Recently, the treatment of breast cancer has become increasingly challenging owing to the increase in tumor heterogeneity and aggressiveness, which gives rise to therapeutic resistance. Epidemiological, population-based, and hospital-based case-control studies have demonstrated an association between high intake of certain Allium vegetables and a reduced risk in the development of breast cancer. Diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) are the main allyl sulfur compounds present in garlic, and are known to exhibit anticancer activity as they interfere with breast cancer cell proliferation, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis. The present review highlights multidrug resistance mechanisms and their signaling pathways in breast cancer. This review discusses the potential anticancer activities of DADS and DATS, with emphasis on drug resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Understanding the anticancer activities of DADS and DATS provides insights into their potential in targeting drug resistance mechanisms of TNBC, especially in clinical studies.</p><hr><h4 id=the-multifaceted-roles-of-sulfane-sulfur-species-in-cancer-associated-processes---feb-2021>The multifaceted roles of sulfane sulfur species in cancer-associated processes - Feb 2021</h4><p>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics Volume 1862, Issue 2, 1 February 2021, 148338 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.148338>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.148338</a> FREE PDF</p><p>Sulfane sulfur species comprise a variety of biologically relevant hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-derived species, including per- and poly-sulfidated low molecular weight compounds and proteins. A growing body of evidence suggests that H2S, currently recognized as a key signaling molecule in human physiology and pathophysiology, plays an important role in cancer biology by modulating cell bioenergetics and contributing to metabolic reprogramming. This is accomplished through functional modulation of target proteins via H2S binding to heme iron centers or H2S-mediated reversible per- or poly-sulfidation of specific cysteine residues. Since sulfane sulfur species are increasingly viewed not only as a major source of H2S but also as key mediators of some of the biological effects commonly attributed to H2S, the multifaceted role of these species in cancer biology is reviewed here with reference to H2S, focusing on their metabolism, signaling function, impact on cell bioenergetics and anti-tumoral properties.</p><hr><h4 id=gastrointestinal-cancers-reduced-35-by-garlic----meta-analysis-feb-2022>Gastrointestinal cancers reduced 35% by Garlic - Meta-analysis Feb 2022</h4><p><strong>Association and mechanism of garlic consumption with gastrointestinal cancer risk: A systematic review and meta‑analysis</strong></p><p>Oncology Letters <a href=https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2022.13245>https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2022.13245</a> FREE PDF</p><p>Yangyang Wang Ping Huang Yufei Wu Duanrui Liu Mingyu Ji Huanjie Li Yunshan Wang</p><p>Gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer type worldwide, with millions of cases per year. The aim of this review was to investigate the relationship between garlic intake and the risk reduction of gastrointestinal cancer. We performed saturated data mining on various public domain databases, including PubMed (<a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)</a>, Embase (<a href="https://www.embase.com/landing?status=grey)">https://www.embase.com/landing?status=grey)</a>, and Cochrane Library (<a href=https://www.cochranelibrary.com/)>https://www.cochranelibrary.com/)</a>, with key terms including: ‘garlic’, ‘allium’, ‘stomach’, ‘gastric’, ‘colon’, ‘neoplasms’, ‘cancer’ and ‘tumor’. Furthermore, we identified additional references through expert manual curation. Finally, a meta‑analysis was conducted to determine whether garlic intake reduces the risk of gastric and/or colorectal cancer. The association between garlic intake and reduction in the risk of gastric cancer <span>[odds ratio (OR)=0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.49‑0.87, P&lt;0.001]</span> were clear.</p><p>Nine studies on garlic intake and colorectal cancer showed that garlic reduced cancer risk with a statistical significance (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.65‑0.87, P&lt;0.001). We summarized that four main organic sulfides in garlic,</p><ul><li><p>diallyl disulfide (DADS),</p></li><li><p>diallyl trisulfide (DATS),</p></li><li><p>S‑allylmercaptocysteine (SAMC) and</p></li><li><p>allicin,</p></li></ul><p>may contribute to the regulation of tumor cell apoptosis, migration and the cell cycle. We identified the association between garlic intake and reduced risk of gastric and colorectal cancers and hypothesized that the active ingredients in garlic may act on multiple pathways to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal tumors according to published papers. Importantly, the potential tumor‑preventing effect of these garlic ingredients warrants further investigation in regards to the specific mechanism of the underlying antitumor activities.</p><hr><h4 id=safety-and-health-benefits-of-onions---july-2021>Safety and Health benefits of Onions - July 2021</h4><p><strong>Recent Advances in Bioactive Compounds, Health Functions, and Safety Concerns of Onion (Allium cepa L.)</strong></p><p>Front Nutr. 2021; 8: 669805. 2021 Jul 22. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.669805>doi: 10.3389/fnut.2021.669805</a> FREE PDF</p><p>Xin-Xin Zhao,1,2,† Fang-Jun Lin,3,† Hang Li,1 Hua-Bin Li,4 Ding-Tao Wu,5 Fang Geng,5 Wei Ma,1,2 Yu Wang,1,2 Bao-He Miao,1,2,* and Ren-You Gan1,2,5,*</p><p>Onion (Allium cepa L.) is a common vegetable, widely consumed all over the world.</p><p>Onion contains diverse phytochemicals, including organosulfur compounds, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, and saponins.</p><p>The phenolic and sulfur-containing compounds, including onionin A, cysteine sulfoxides, quercetin, and quercetin glucosides, are the major bioactive constituents of onion.

Finally, this review aims to provide a potential strategy for using nanotechnology to increase the stability and solubility of garlic components, providing guidelines for the qualities of garlic products to improve their absorption and prevent their early degradation, and extend their circulation time in the body. The application of nanotechnology to improve the bioavailability and targeting of garlic compounds are expected to provide a theoretical basis for the functional components of garlic to treat human health. We review the improvement of bioavailability and bioactivity of garlic bioactive compounds via nanotechnology, which could promisingly overcome the limitations of conventional garlic products, and would be used to prevent and treat cancer and other diseases in the near future.</p><hr><h4 id=amazon-has-500-garlic-supplements---including-odorless>Amazon has 500+ Garlic supplements - including odorless</h4></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/breast-cancer.html><span class=tag>breast cancer</span></a>
