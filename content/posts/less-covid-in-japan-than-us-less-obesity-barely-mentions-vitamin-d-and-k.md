The U.S. and Japan are both democratic industrialized societies, but the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths per million people in the U.S. (including Japanese Americans) are 12.1-times and 17.4-times higher, respectively, than those in Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of diet on preventing COVID-19 infection. An analysis of dietary intake and the prevalence of obesity in the populations of both countries was performed, and their effects on COVID-19 infection were examined. Approximately 1.5-times more saturated fat and less eicosapentaenoic acid/docosahexaenoic acid are consumed in the U.S. than in Japan. 

 **Intake - Note: Vitamin D and Vitamin K are low in the US vs Japan**

Compared with food intakes in Japan (100%), those in the U.S. were as follows:

* beef 396%, 

* sugar and sweeteners 235%, 

* fish 44.3%, 

* rice 11.5%, 

* soybeans 0.5%, and

* tea 54.7%. 

The last four of these foods contain functional substances that prevent COVID-19. 

 **The prevalence of obesity is 7.4- and 10-times greater in the U.S. than in Japan for males and females, respectively** 

Mendelian randomization established a causal relationship between obesity and COVID-19 infection. Large differences in nutrient intakes and the prevalence of obesity, but not racial differences, may be partly responsible for differences in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 between the U.S. and Japan.
