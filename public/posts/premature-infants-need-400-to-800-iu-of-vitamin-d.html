It did not specifically discuss the importance of vitamin D supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all infants consume a minimum of 400 IU per day of vitamin D beginning shortly after birth, particularly breastfed or partially breastfed infants.1 Human breast milk is low in vitamin D, containing less than 25 IU per L.2 Even with adequate oral intake, a premature infant would still receive far less than the recommended daily amount of vitamin D.</p><p>The article does mention that breast milk can be supplemented with a multinutrient fortifier, but that benefit postdischarge is not clear. Although common commercial preparations, (e.g., Similac Human Milk Fortifier, Enfamil Human Milk Fortifier) contain vitamin D, breastfed infants discharged without fortified milk will not benefit from this type of vitamin D supplementation. Sequelae of vitamin D deficiency among breastfed infants, such as rickets and hypocalcemia, are not common; however, supplementation is essential to prevent potential illness in this already vulnerable patient population.</p><p>SONYA SHIPLEY, MD, Flowood, Miss., <a href=mailto:sshipley@umc.edu>sshipley@umc.edu</a>, Author disclosure: No relevant financial affiliations.</p><p>REFERENCES</p><ol><li><p>Wagner CL, et al.

Prematurity and the metabolic demands of sick newborns can put them at high risk of poor bone growth and health.1</p><p>Our article focused on guidelines for the outpatient follow-up of newborns discharged from neonatal intensive care units that deviate from routine newborn care and guidelines. As Dr. Shipley stated, the AAP recommends that all infants, shortly after birth, begin receiving 400 IU per day of vitamin D.2,3 This can be achieved with consumption of greater than 1 L per day of formula (which usually occurs by approximately one month of age) or vitamin D supplementation for those infants consuming breast milk or less than 1 L per day of formula (i.e., mixed feeding). This recommendation does not differ for graduates of neonatal intensive care units.</p><p>Regarding fortification of human breast milk, our discussion was to address concerns of extrauterine growth failure, not vitamin deficiencies. If breast milk is to be fortified as an outpatient, it is typically done with formula, as human milk fortifiers are not readily available other than for inpatient use. Because the amount of vitamin D provided would likely be less than 400 IU per day, supplementation is recommended. 2–4</p><p>Recently published studies suggest increasing the recommended vitamin D dosage to 800 IU per day. In a randomized double-blind trial (n = 96), the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was significantly lower in preterm infants receiving 800 IU per day than in those receiving 400 IU per day at 40 weeks (38% vs. 67%) and at three months corrected age (12% vs. 35%). However, there was no improvement in bone mineralization between the two groups. One infant receiving 800 IU per day had vitamin D excess.5 In 2008, the AAP released new recommendations increasing the dosage of vitamin D from 200 to 400 IU per day based on growing evidence of vitamin D deficiencies in infants receiving lower dosages. Until larger trials are completed, 400 IU per day of vitamin D supplementation is the best evidence-based recommendation.</p><p>Interestingly, a longitudinal survey from 2010 revealed that very few infants were receiving adequate vitamin D supplementation. Only 5% to 13% of breastfed infants, 9% to 14% of mixed-fed infants, and 20% to 37% of formula-fed infants met the AAP recommendation. 6 This evidence underscores the importance of vitamin D supplementation. Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about ingestion of vitamin D in this at-risk population.</p><p>ROBERT L.

Free vitamin D was calculated using molar ratios of 25(OH)D and DBP. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare DBP, free D and 25(OH)D levels; Spearman&rsquo;s correlation coefficients were used to assess correlations.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>The mean gestational age at birth was 30.5 weeks; mean birth weight was 1405 g. Mean 25(OH)D levels at birth were 17.3 ng/mL; DBP levels were 297 mg/L, and estimated free vitamin D levels were 18.9. There was a statistically significant change in 25(OH)D levels after 8 weeks (24.6 vs. 39.1 ng/mL in the 400 vs. 800 group, respectively, p=0.02). DBP levels from birth to 8 weeks showed a statistically significant decrease (267 vs. 208, p=0.04). Estimated free 25(OH)D concentrations increased over the study period, from 18.9 at birth to 64.7 at 8 weeks of age (p=0.0001). Free vitamin D levels at birth were associated with global DEXA bone mineral content at discharge from the NICU (r=0.58, p=0.05).</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Supplementation with vitamin D3 increased the free portion of the vitamin D metabolite, providing increased bioavailable substrate.

The objective of this study was to evaluate concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24,25(OH)2D3, and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 in premature infants.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>32 infants &lt;32 weeks gestation were randomized to receive 400 or 800IU/day of vitamin D3 orally. Vitamin D metabolites from serum obtained monthly were analyzed in triplicate using a novel, very sensitive Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry-based method. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Fisher&rsquo;s exact test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and Spearman correlation coefficients. Measurements over time were fit with linear mixed effect models. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Mean serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations in cord blood were 17.3 ng/mL; mean 3-epi-25(OH)D3 were 1.3 ng/mL, mean 24,25(OH)2D3 were 1.4 ng/mL. Both 25(OH)D3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 increased significantly over time, and the percent of total 25(OH)D3 concentration that was 3-epi-25(OH)D3 also increased significantly (7.2% vs. 29.7%, p &lt; 0.0001 for cord blood vs. 8 weeks). Serum 25(OH)D3:24,25(OH)2D3 ratios at weeks 4 and 8 were higher than ratios reported in older children and adults.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>Vitamin D metabolism in infants appears to have distinct differences from adults. Vitamin D supplementation was effective in raising 25(OH)D3 concentrations; however significant increases in 3-epi-25(OH)D3 also occurred. Increased 25(OH)D3: 24,25(OH)2D3 ratios in premature infants may be due to immature expression of CYP24A1. Further work is necessary to determine if there are developmental advantages to this unique vitamin D metabolism.</p><p>PMID: 26302850</p><p><strong><a href=http://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(15)00219-8/abstract>Publisher wants $31.50 for PDF</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=99-of-preterm-infants-have-insufficient-vitamin-d--nov-2015>99% of preterm infants have insufficient vitamin D – Nov 2015</h4><p><strong>Severe vitamin D deficiency in preterm infants: maternal and neonatal clinical features.</strong></p><p>Korean J Pediatr. 2015 Nov;58(11):427-33. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2015.58.11.427.>doi: 10.3345/kjp.2015.58.11.427.</a> Epub 2015 Nov 22.</p><p>Park SH1, Lee GM1, Moon JE1, Kim HM1.</p><p>1Department of Pediatrics, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.</p><p>PURPOSE:</p><p>We investigated the vitamin D status of preterm infants to determine the incidence of vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>A total of 278 preterm infants delivered at Kyungpook National University Hospital between January 2013 and May 2015 were enrolled.

We collected maternal and neonatal data such as maternal gestational diabetes, premature rupture of membranes, maternal preeclampsia, birth date, gestational age, and birth weight.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Mean gestational age was 33(+5)±2(+2) weeks of gestation and mean 25-OHD concentrations were 10.7±6.4 ng/mL. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was 91.7%, and 51.1% of preterm infants were classified as having severe vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD&lt;10 ng/mL). The serum 25-OHD concentrations did not correlate with gestational age. There were no significant differences in serum 25-OHD concentrations or incidence of severe vitamin D deficiency among early, moderate, and late preterm infants.</p><p>The risk of severe vitamin D deficiency in <strong>twin preterm</strong> infants was significantly higher than that in singletons (odds ratio, <strong>1.993</strong> ; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 1.137-3.494, P=0.016).
