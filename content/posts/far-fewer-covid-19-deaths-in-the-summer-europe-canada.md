#### [Covid-19 and Vitamin D : cases â€“ deaths dissociation in August](http://www.drdavidgrimes.com/2020/08/covid-19-and-vitamin-d-cases-deaths.html) Dr. David Grimes - blog post

 **Possible reasons include** 

1.  **<span style="color:#00F;">Increased Vitamin D from the sun</span>** 

1. Increased vitamin D sales ([25X in Ireland](/tags/25x-in-ireland.html) and [30X in UK](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/health/sales-vitamin-d-supplements-up-22028179))

1. Virus had mutated

1. More people have partial immunity

   * Note: A mask appears to allow sampling a small amount of the vurus, and gain some immunity

      * [Hamsters which wore masks](https://ucsf.app.box.com/s/blvolkp5z0mydzd82rjks4wyleagt036) had greatly reduced COVID-19 symptoms when again exposed to COVID-19

1. Hospital procedures had greatly improved
