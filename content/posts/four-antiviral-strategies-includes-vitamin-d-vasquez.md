1. Targeting the virus directly: Selenium, herbal tea licorice, 

1. Blocking viral replication : **Vitamin D** , Folic, betaine and S-adenosyl-methionine.

1. Supporting immune function: of glutamine, whey protein isolate, vitamin A,  **vitamin D** , fish oil, and zinc

1. Supporting cellular and whole-body health: exercise, low-carbohydrate diets, coenzyme Q-10, lipoic acid, and acetyl-L-carnitine

*  **Update Dec 16, 2014 - I bought the book. Huge amount of detail on many of the diseases that vitamin D helps prevent/treat may be due to virus - both to human cells and the non-human cells in our gut**
