#### Women with Recurrent Miscarriage Have Decreased Expression of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3-1α-Hydroxylase by the Fetal-Maternal Interface.

 **Facts about Vitamin D activation** 

* Vitamin D must be activated before a majority of the benefits can be realized

* Vitamin D can be activated by Liver & Kidney and put into the bloodstream

* Vitamin D can also be activated locally by most tissues in the body 

> Local activation is not detected by Vitamin D tests

* Vitamin D is activated by the fetus sometime during gestation

 **Possibilities** 

1. Placenta itself needs activated vitamin D all during gestation

1. Fetus needs activated vitamin D before it’s liver and kidneys start functioning

> &nbsp; &nbsp; during the time in which miscarriages typically occur

 **CYP27B1 RNA** 

 **| | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tissues  | Control  | Primary miscarriage,  | Recurrent miscarriage  | P |
| Villous  | 1.20 | 0.81 | 0.40 | 0.000 |
| Decidual  | 1.35 | 1.20 | 0.44  | 0.003 |** 

 **Easy options to avoid miscarriages due to CYP27B1 restriction** 

1. Increase blood-levels of Vitamin D 

> e.g. Increase some/all of vitamin D supplements, sunshine, UV, Magnesium, Boron, Omega-3

1. Increase Vitamin D Receptor (which results in more Vitamin D getting into cells)
