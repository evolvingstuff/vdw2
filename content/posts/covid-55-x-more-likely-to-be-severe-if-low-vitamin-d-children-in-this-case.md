#### Vitamin D status can affect COVID-19 outcomes also in pediatric population

PharmaNutrition . 2022 Oct 14;100319. [doi: 10.1016/j.phanu.2022.100319](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phanu.2022.100319)

Background: vitamin D influences the immune system and the inflammatory response. It is known that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of acute respiratory tract infection. In the last two years, many researchers have investigated vitamin D's role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease.

Results: the findings obtained from clinical trials and systematic reviews highlight that most patients with COVID-19 have decreased vitamin D levels and low levels of vitamin D increase the risk of severe disease. This evidence seems to be also confirmed in the pediatric population.

Conclusions: further studies (systematic review and meta-analysis) conducted on children are needed to confirm that vitamin D affects COVID-19 outcomes and to determine the effectiveness of supplementation and the appropriate dose, duration and mode of administration.
