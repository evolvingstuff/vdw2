#### Biden to Choose Robert Califf to Lead F.D.A., Despite Drug Industry Ties

 **[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/us/politics/robert-califf-fda.html)** 

* "The move would end nearly a year of political wrangling as the White House vetted then dropped several candidates after complaints that some were too close to the pharmaceutical industry."

* "Dr. Califf, who remains an adjunct professor of medicine at both Duke and Stanford University, is on the corporate board of Cytokinetics, a biopharmaceutical company, according to its website. He has received personal fees for consulting from Merck, Amgen, Biogen, Genentech, Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim, according to his Duke University biography."

* "The Food and Drug Administration regulates products accounting for about 20 cents of every dollar spent by consumers in the United States"
