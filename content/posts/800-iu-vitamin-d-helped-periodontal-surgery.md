# The Impact of Vitamin D Status on Periodontal Surgery Outcomes.

J Dent Res. 2011 May 9.

Vitamin D regulates calcium and immune function. While vitamin D deficiency has been associated with periodontitis, little information exists regarding its effect on wound healing and periodontal surgery outcomes. This longitudinal clinical trial assessed outcomes of periodontal surgery and teriparatide administration in vitamin-D-sufficient and -insufficient individuals. 

Forty individuals with severe chronic periodontitis received periodontal surgery, daily calcium and vitamin D supplements, and self-administered teriparatide or placebo for 6 wks to correspond with osseous healing time. 

Serum 25(OH) D was evaluated at baseline, 6 wks, and 6 mos post-surgery. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were evaluated over 1 yr. 

Placebo patients with baseline vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D, 16-19 ng/mL)

* had significantly less clinical attachment loss (CAL) gain (-0.43 mm vs. 0.92 mm, p < 0.01) and 

* probing depth (PPD) reduction (0.43 mm vs. 1.83 mm, p < 0.01) 

than vitamin-D-sufficient individuals. Vitamin D levels had no significant impact on CAL and PPD improvements in teriparatide patients at 1 yr, 

but infrabony defect resolution was greater in teriparatide-treated vitamin-D-sufficient vs. -deficient individuals (2.05 mm vs. 0.87 mm, p = 0.03). 

Vitamin D  **deficiency**  at the time of periodontal surgery negatively affects treatment outcomes for up to 1 yr. 

Analysis of these data suggests that vitamin D status may be critical for post-surgical healing. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, CT00277706).

## PDF indicates that they added 1000 mg of Calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D daily 3 days before surgery and 6 weeks after surgery

(from WikiPedia):  **Teriparatide**  (Forteo, also available in generic form<sup>[1]</sup>) is a recombinant form of parathyroid hormone, used in the treatment of some forms of osteoporosis.<sup>[2]</sup> It is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company.

## [CT00277706](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00277706?term=00277706&rank=1%20)

## BOTH the main and placebo arms of the Clinical trial got vitamin D and Calcium.  The only difference was that the placebo arms did not get the Forteo (Lilly labs)
