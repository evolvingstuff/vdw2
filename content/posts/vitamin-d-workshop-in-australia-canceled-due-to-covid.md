 **PLANNING FOR NEXT MEETING IS ON HOLD (March 25, 2020)** 

PLEASE NOTE the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted planning for the 2020 Vitamin D Workshop. Australia has prohibited flights in/out of the country until the end of May and also banned large gatherings for 6 months. It is therefore impossible for the August conference to proceed as planned. The involved societies (VDW, ANZBMS and MEPSA) are conferring with the meeting planner ASN and the Gold Coast Convention Center to explore options for postponement, although cancellation is also a possibility.
