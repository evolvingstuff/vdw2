 **Heart Failure Definitions** 

*  **[Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/basics/definition/con-20029801)**  Heart failure, sometimes known as  **congestive heart failure** , occurs when your heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Certain conditions, such as narrowed arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease) or high blood pressure, gradually leave your heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently.

*  **[American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartFailure/AboutHeartFailure/What-is-Heart-Failure_UCM_002044_Article.jsp#.WZX4v1GGPIU)** : The term "heart failure" makes it sound like the heart is no longer working at all and there's nothing that can be done. Actually, heart failure means that the heart isn't pumping as well as it should be.  **Congestive heart failure is a type of heart failure which requires seeking timely medical attention, although sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably.**

Aims

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of heart failure in elderly patients of cardiology outpatient clinics.

Methods and results

A cross-sectional study with an analytical approach was employed. Clinical data were collected from the elderly from August 2015 to February 2016. The dependent variable was the risk of heart failure; the independent variable was vitamin D deficiency; and intervening factors were age, gender, education, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, dementia, stroke, dyslipidaemia, depression, smoking, alcoholism, obesity, andropause, and cardiac arrhythmia. 

To analyse the association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of heart failure, we used the bivariate logistic analysis, followed by analysis through the multivariate logistic regression model. 

Of the 137 elderly, the study found the following: 

* women (75.9%); 

* overweight (48.2%); 

* obese (30.6%); 

* increase in the index waist/hip (88.3%); 

* dyslipidaemia (94.2%) and 

* hypertension (91.2%); 

* coronary artery disease (35.0%); and 

* 27.7% with cardiac arrhythmia or left ventricular hypertrophy. 

Sixty-five per cent of the elderly were deficient in vitamin D. 

The risk of heart failure was significantly associated with 

* vitamin D deficiency <span>[odds ratio (OR): *__12.19__; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.23–35.16; P = 0.000]</span>, 

* male gender (OR: 15.32; 95% CI = 3.39–69.20, P = 0.000), 

* obesity (OR: 4.17; 95% CI = 1.36–12.81; P = 0.012), and 

* cardiac arrhythmia (OR: 3.69; 95% CI = 1.23–11.11; P = 0.020).

Conclusions

There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly, and the evidence shows a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of heart failure in this population.

#### Heart Failure in Italy 66 % more likely if <10 ng of vitamin D – March 2018

 **Serum vitamin D deficiency and risk of hospitalization for heart failure: Prospective results from the Moli-sani study** 

Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases, Vol 28, Issue 3, March 2018, Pages 298-307, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2017.11.008

 **Highlights** 

* Findings from epidemiological studies on Vitamin D deficiency and risk of heart failure (HF) are controversial.

* In Italian adults, levels of Vitamin D (<10 ng/mL) was associated with a higher risk (+61%) of hospitalization for HF.

* Adjustment for subclinical inflammation did not substantially change the association between Vitamin D deficiency and HF.

Background and aims

Evidence indicates that Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, although findings on risk of heart failure (HF) are controversial. We investigated the relationship between serum Vitamin D and the incidence of hospitalization for HF in a large prospective cohort of Italian adults.

Methods and results

19,092 (49% men, age range 35–99 years) HF-free individuals from the Moli-sani study, with complete data on serum Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin) levels and incident hospitalized HF, were analysed. The cohort was followed up for a median of 6.2 years. Baseline serum Vitamin D levels were categorized in deficient (<10 ng/mL), insufficient (10–29 ng/mL), and normal (≥30 ng/mL) Incident cases of hospitalization for HF were identified by linkage with the regional hospital discharge registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox-proportional hazard models. The prevalence of normal, insufficient or deficient levels of Vitamin D was 12.2%, 79.6% and 8.2%, respectively. During follow-up, 562 admissions to hospital for HF were identified. The incidence of HF was 1.6%, 2.9% and 5.3%, respectively in subjects with normal, insufficient and deficient levels of Vitamin D. After multivariable analysis, individuals with deficiency of Vitamin D had a higher risk of hospitalization for HF (HR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.06–2.43) than those with normal levels. Further adjustment for subclinical inflammation did not substantially change the association between Vitamin D deficiency and HF.

Conclusion

Deficiency of Vitamin D was associated, independently of known HF risk factors, with an increased risk of hospitalization for HF in an Italian adult population.
