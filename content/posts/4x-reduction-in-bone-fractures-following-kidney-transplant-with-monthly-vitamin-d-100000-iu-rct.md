#### [VITALE study: High-dose vitamin D effective in lowering fracture rates after kidney transplantation](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20190617/VITALE-study-High-dose-vitamin-D-effective-in-lowering-fracture-rates-after-kidney-transplantation.aspx) news-medical.net

* “The aim of the  **VITALE**  study was to compare the transplantation. A prospective, multicenter, double-blind, controlled trial, VITALE randomly assigned 536 kidney transplant recipients (mean age 50.8 years, 335 males) to either 100,000 IU (high dose) or 12,000 IU (low dose) cholecalciferol every two weeks for two months, then monthly for 22 months. In the study, 'low dose' corresponded to a minimum recommended intake of 400 UI/day.”

* “The incidence of fractures was significantly lower in the high-dose group (1% versus 4% in the low-dose group; p=0.02).”
