In order to return to normal life, we will all have to find ways to boost our immunity against infection.

COVID-19 is a more virulent, and a very much more infectious, version of the influenza that occurs world-wide every year towards the end of the winter - examples of which are SARS and MERS.

A vaccine is never going to prevent the next strain of Influenza, since vaccines take many months to develop and we are always chasing ways to stop the last one - not the next one

We are not going to learn from the medical profession or government about natural ways to boost our immunity, since most modern doctors do not understand anything which is not a licensed drug.

I have spent 10 years interacting with many NHS scientific advisory committees including NICE, and none of them can cope with "Diet and Lifestyle" - because they don't understand it.  An example if this is a GP who proudly told me that "I know nothing about Nutrition" - how sad and dangerous !  Another is an eye surgeon who told me that she does not give advice about Omega-3 - because "Vitamins are dangerous"

Dr Andrew Saul maintains that we should take large amounts of Vitamin C when we are stressed or ill.  http://doctoryourself.com/

Dr Cicero Coimbra, Dr William Grant and Henry Lahore show evidence that high levels of Vitamin D boost our natural immunity against the annual Influenza and COVID-19   https://VitaminDWiki.com/Vitamin+D+WOW+facts

Dr Sarah Myhill suggests that we should inhale iodine vapour, since that coats our nasal passages and upper airways with an antiseptic that kills the virus when we breath it in  https://www.drmyhill.co.uk/

Dr Paul Marik has a protocol involving Vitamin C, Vitamin B1 and steroids that have a synergistic effect in treating Sepsis, that also helps to treat Influenza and Pneumonia. https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/administrative_offices/marketing_communications/publications/issue_9_4/sepsis.php

Dr Joseph Mercola has published "10-Tips to Beat Coronavirus" that add several foods, traditional herbal remedies and supplements, such as Elderberry, Spirulina, Beta Glucans, Glucosamine, Selenium, Zinc, Alpha Lipoic Acid and Sulphoraphane  https://www.mercola.com/ 

We are not going to hear about these ways to build immunity from the medical profession, because the doctors in NICE in the UK do not understand them and the FDA in USA has banned anyone making claims for treatment or prevention using anything but licensed drugs. 

Also, Google and Facebook altered their search algorithms in June 2019 to block any claims that do not use licensed drugs, mostly as part of their war against Fake News but probably to keep the advertising revenue from the drug companies.

Many of the general public do understand some of these natural methods of boosting our immunity, including how sunlight is the best disinfectant - except that the dermatologists have taken over the lunatic asylum and told us to stay out of the sun !

So if we aren't going to hear these messages from our doctors or our search engines or social media or the mainstream media, where and how are we going to learn about ways to prevent infection from COVID-19 and the next version ?
