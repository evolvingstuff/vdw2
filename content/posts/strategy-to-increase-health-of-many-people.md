## Goal = improved health for most

#### Must not:

Be too expensive

Take too much time

Take too  much effort

Exceed medical guidelines

#### Should:

Be easy to remember to do

Economically benefit at least one party (employer, insurance, society, individual)

Result in benefits which can be measured in less than a year

---

## Phase 1

Document the benefits of taking 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily

---

## Additional ways to improve health

 **Educate participants - individuals do not have to wait** 

 **Sequencing to be determined** 

#### Special groups

Have health problem or take drugs which decrease Vitamin D

Have health problem which was probably caused by low vitamin D

Fear or have health problem which is strongly associated with low vitamin (genes?) - most autoimmune, for example

Have health problem which is associated with poor vitamin D genes 

Live far from equator (especially if recently moved from near the equator)

Shut-in/ little sun

Non-adults: preemies, infants, children

#### More than 4,000 IU if overweight/obese

 **Many nutrients are based of body weight, why not vitamin D too?** 

#### Reduce the Vitamin D cost and effort - take less frequently

e.g. 50,000 IU once every two weeks

#### Alter the dose for some individuals

 **Poor test results or lack of benefit to previous dose size after 3 months** 

May need more than 4,000 IU

May need a different form (Gut-friendly)

May need Magnesium or another co-factor

#### If must restore Vitamin D levels quickly:  days or weeks

Loading dose of ~400,000 IU spread out over 1 - 40 days

&nbsp; &nbsp; such as for medical procedure, avoid virus, ICU, pregnancy

#### Cofactors

#### Increased Exercise

Note: Exercise takes a lot of time and effort

### Improve Nutrition

Note: Good nutrition takes a lot of time, effort, and cost

#### Increase beyond "4,000" IU

Pregnant, breastfeeding, MS, Asthma, COPD, Hives, Kidney Disease, Migraine, Knee osteoarthritis, PMS, Ulcers (Venous), etc.
