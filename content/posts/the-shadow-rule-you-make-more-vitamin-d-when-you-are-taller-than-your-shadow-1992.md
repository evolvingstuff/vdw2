“ **A general rule of thumb?   
When you are taller than your shadow, your body is able to make vitamin D** ”

#### [Atmospheric sun protection factor on clear days: its observed dependence on solar zenith angle and its relevance to the shadow rule for sun protection](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1502267) 1992

#### [The shadow rule: a simple method for sun protection.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671831) 1998

“Thus, when a person's shadow is shorter than the person is tall, the intensity of UVR from the sun is more likely to cause sunburn.”

#### Actually: Generate about <span style="color:#F00;">1/2 as much vitamin D</span> when shadow is as long as you are tall

 **Example of how much Vitamin D can be generated at 23 degrees latitude in the summer** 

 **Shaded areas are when the shadow is longer than the person** 

 **Lots of good Vitamin D in the morning - before it gets too hot**
