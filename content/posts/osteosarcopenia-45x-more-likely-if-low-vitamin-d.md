**<span style="color:#00F;">Osteosarcopenia</span> is a syndrome that occurs when someone has both osteoporosis and sarcopenia.  
Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and bone tissue deterioration.   
Sarcopenia  is characterized by a loss of muscle mass, strength, and function.**

#### Osteosarcopenia later in life: Prevalence and associated risk factors

Clin Nutr ESPEN  2023 Dec:58:213-220. [doi: 10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.08.030](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.08.030)

Background and aims: The identification of risk factors for osteosarcopenia in older adults is important for planning preventative strategies in clinical practice. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with osteosarcopenia in older adults using different diagnostic criteria.

Methods: The sample included 171 community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of 79.4 ± 5.9 years and mean body mass index of 25.67 ± 4.70 kg/m2. We analyzed sociodemographic, biomarkers, lifestyle, and health condition data from participants of the "Projeto Idosos - Goiânia" cohort study. The outcome osteosarcopenia was defined as the simultaneous occurrence of sarcopenia and osteopenia. Osteopenia was diagnosed by low lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Sarcopenia was diagnosed using handgrip dynamometry and appendicular skeletal mass index assessed by DEXA following the criteria of the two European consensuses on sarcopenia (2010 and 2018). Two osteosarcopenia outcome variables were evaluated: OsteoSarc1 and OsteoSarc2 using the 2010 and 2018 European sarcopenia consensus criteria, respectively. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis was used to calculate the prevalence ratios (PRs).

Results: The prevalence of OsteoSarc1 and OsteoSarc2 were 12.8% and 7.2%, respectively, with no significant gender differences. OsteoSarc1 was associated with 

* low potassium (PR: 3.39, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 1.10-10.43) and 

* malnutrition (PR: 3.84, 95% CI: 1.78-8.30). 

OsteoSarc2 was associated with 

* being ≥80 years (PR: 7.64, 95% CI: 1.57-37.07), 

* >4 years of education (PR: 3.25, 95% CI: 1.03-10.22), 

* alcohol consumption (PR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.01-5.77), 

* low potassium (PR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.45-6.87), 

*  **low serum vitamin D (PR: 4.4** 7, 95% CI: 1.68-11.88), and 

* malnutrition (PR: 5.00, 95% CI: 1.06-23.51).

Conclusions: OsteoSarc1 had a higher prevalence. The risk factors associated with the two outcomes were malnutrition and potassium level, as well as other risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and low vitamin D level. These findings may contribute to the prevention or treatment of this health condition in older adults.
