Objective: The recommended daily intakes of vitamin D according to the recent Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) of the Endocrine Society are 3-to-5-fold higher than the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report. We speculated that these differences could be explained by different mathematical approaches to the vitamin D dose response.

Methods: Studies were selected if the daily dose was  **<=2000 International Units (IU)/d** , the duration exceeded 3 months, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were measured at baseline and post-therapy. The rate constant was estimated according to the CPG approach. 

The achieved 25OHD result was estimated according to: 

* (1) the regression equation approach of the IOM; 

* (2) the regression approach of the Vitamin D Supplementation in Older Subjects (VIDOS) study; and 

* (3) the CPG approach using a rate constant of 2.5 (CPG2.5) 

* and a rate constant of 5.0 (CPG5.0). 

The difference between the expected and observed 25OHD result was expressed as a percentage of observed, and analysed for significance against a value of 0% for the four groups.

Results: Forty-one studies were analysed. The mean (CI) rate constant was 5.3(4.4-6.2) nmol/L /100 IU/d, on average 2-fold higher than the CPG rate constant. The mean (CI) for the difference between the expected and observed expressed as a percentage of observed were: 

* (1) IOM, -7(-16,+2)% (t=1.64, p=0.110); 

* (2) VIDOS, +2(-8,+12)% (t=0.40, p=0.69); 

* (3) CPG2.5, -21(-27,-15)% (t=7.2, p<0.0001); and 

* (4) CPG5.0 +3(-4,+10)% (t=0.91, p=0.366).

Conclusion: The CPG "rule of thumb" should be doubled to 5.0 nmol/L (2.0 ng/ml)/100 IU/d, adopting a more risk-averse position.
