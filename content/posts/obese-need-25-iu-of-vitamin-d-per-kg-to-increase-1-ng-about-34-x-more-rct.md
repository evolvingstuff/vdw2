Context: Guidelines have suggested that obese adults need two to three times more vitamin D than lean adults to treat vitamin D deficiency, but few studies have evaluated the vitamin D dose response in obese subjects.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 25(OH)D response to 3 different doses of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in a group of obese subjects and to quantify the 25(OH)D dose response relationship.

Design, Setting, Intervention, Patients: This was a randomized, single blind study of 3 doses of oral vitamin D3 (1,000 IU, 5,000 IU, or 10,000 IU) given daily to 67 obese subjects for 21 weeks during the winter months.

Main Outcome Measures: Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at baseline and after vitamin D replacement, and 25(OH)D pharmacokinetic parameters were determined, fitting the 25(OH)D concentrations to an exponential model.

Results: Mean measured increments in 25(OH)D at week 21 were: 12.4- (SD 9.7) ng/ml in the 1,000 IU/d group, 27.8 (SD10.2) ng/mL in the 5,000 IU/d group, and 48.1(SD 19.6) ng/ml in the 10,000 IU/d group. Steady state increments computed from the model were 20.6 (SD 17.1) ng/ml, 35.2 (SD 14.6) ng/ml, and 51.3 (SD 22.0) ng/ml, respectively. There were no hypercalcuria or hypercalcemia events during the study.

Conclusion: Our data show that in obese people the 25(OH)D response to vitamin D3 is directly related to dose and body size with ∾ 2.5 IU/kg required for every unit increment in 25(OH)D (ng/ml).
