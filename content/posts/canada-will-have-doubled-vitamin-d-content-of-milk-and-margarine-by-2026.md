##### Mistake #1: Forcing all of the products to be fortified - encouraging rather than forcing is far batter

##### Mistake #2: Fortification independent of fat content (bioavailability of D from low-fat  milk is about <a href="/posts/skim-fat-milk-provides-3-percent-less-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Skim fat milk provides 3% less vitamin D â€“ May 2016">2.5X less</a> )
