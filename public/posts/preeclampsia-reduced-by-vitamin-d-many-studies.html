The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on the incidence of preeclampsia in primigravid women and its related maternal and foetal outcomes.</p><p>Methods: A single-blinded clinical trial was conducted in fourteen antenatal care health facilities in the North (Goma, Mwesso, Nyiragongo) and South Kivu (Bukavu-Panzi) provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. A total of 1300 primigravid women not exceeding 16 weeks of gestation were randomised with a 1:1 ratio to either the supplemented (A) or control (B) group. Each pregnant woman (A) presenting for antenatal care received a single monthly dose of cholecalciferol (60,000 IU) orally for 6 months. The control group received no vitamin D supplementation or placebo. Serum 25(OH)D was measured at recruitment and at 34 weeks of gestation.

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D is an essential mineral for human health; some studies suggest link between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and preeclampsia, while others offer contradictory findings. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the relationships between maternal 25- hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and the risk of preeclampsia. In addition to this, our study also evaluates the effects of 25- hydroxyvitamin D supplementation on the incidence of preeclampsia. Therefore, assessing 25- hydroxyvitamin D&rsquo;s potential as a possible intervention to lower the risk of preeclampsia.</p><p>Methods: The Medline database was queried from inception until July 2021 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies without any restrictions. The studies assessing the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and preeclampsia and the impact of 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation on the incidence of preeclampsia were incorporated. The results were reported using a random-effects meta-analysis and the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant for the analysis.</p><p>Results: This analysis includes 34 papers, including 10 randomized controlled trials and 24 observational studies. According to our pooled analysis, 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation was significantly associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.40-0.63; p = 0.00001), while 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with an <strong>increased risk of preeclampsia (OR: 4.30</strong> ; 95 % CI: 2.57-7.18; p &lt; 0.00001, OR: 1.71; 95 % Cl: 1.27-2.32; p = 0.0005, OR 1.61; 95 % Cl: 1.21-2.16; p = 0.001).</p><p>Conclusion: Results suggest that 25-hydroxyvitamin D has a significant relationship with preeclampsia as confirmed by the findings that low maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations cause increased risk of preeclampsia while 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of preeclampsia. Our findings indicate that 25-hydroxyvitamin D supplementation can be used as a possible intervention strategy in preventing one of the most common causes of maternal mortality around the world, preeclampsia.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/preeclampsia-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=preeclampsia-3x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-in-mid-pregnancy---may-2023>Preeclampsia 3X more likely if low vitamin D in mid-pregnancy - May 2023</h4><p><strong>Association of maternal vitamin D status with the risk of preeclampsia</strong></p><p>Food Funct. 2023 May 22;14(10):4859-4865. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1039/d3fo00007a>doi: 10.1039/d3fo00007a</a>   PDF is behind a paywall</p><p>Juhi Nema 1, Nisha Wadhwani 1, Karuna Randhir 1, Kamini Dangat 1, Hemlata Pisal 1, Vrushali Kadam 1, Savita Mehendale 2, Girija Wagh 2, Bharati Kulkarni 3, Harshpal Singh Sachdev 4, Caroline Fall 5, Sanjay Gupte 6, Sadhana Joshi 1</p><p>The aim of this study was to examine serum vitamin D concentrations from early pregnancy until delivery in women who did and did not develop preeclampsia. This longitudinal study was carried out in Pune, India. A total of 1154 women with singleton pregnancies were recruited in early pregnancy from two hospitals. Blood samples were collected and stored at four time points across gestation: V1 = 11-14 weeks, V2 = 18-22 weeks, V3 = 26-28 weeks and V4 = at delivery. 108 women who developed preeclampsia (PE) and 216 who did not develop PE (Non-PE) were randomly selected from the remainder. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D) were estimated in their samples using commercially available ELISA kits. Independent t-tests were used to compare 25(OH)D between PE and non-PE groups. Logistic and linear regressions were used to examine associations of 25(OH)D with the risk of preeclampsia and birth outcomes, respectively, after adjusting for confounders. The mean (SD) 25(OH)D at V1 was 21.95 (19.64) in the Non-PE group and 17.76 (13.21) in the PE group.</p><p>A decrease in the concentrations of vitamin D (ng ml-1) in mid-pregnancy (V2) and at delivery was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia (0.31 <span>[95% CI 0.11, 0.86]</span>, p = 0.024 and 0.24 <span>[95% CI 0.08, 0.77]</span>, p = 0.016), respectively. Our finding of lower vitamin D concentrations in mid-pregnancy, before women developed clinical preeclampsia, suggests that vitamin D may have a role in its pathophysiology.</p><hr><h4 id=preeclampsia-4-x-more-likely-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor---aug-2023>Preeclampsia 4 X more-likely if poor Vitamin D Receptor - Aug 2023</h4><p><strong>Impact of vitamin D binding protein (GC) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism on the risk of developing preeclampsia</strong></p><p>Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports Vol 35, Sept 2023, 101526 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2023.101526>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2023.101526</a></p><p>Md Mostafijur Rahman a 1, Tamima Nawfal a 1, Fabliha Afiea Khabir a 1, Md Bayejid Hosen a, Mubasshir Washif a, Yearul Kabir b, M Zakir Hossain Howlader a</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/preeclampsia-vdr.jpg alt=image width=600>

Recent studies provide evidence that maternal Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms probably play a key role by affecting the biological function of vitamin D in some adverse pregnancy outcomes, while the relationship between the VDR gene polymorphisms and the risk of HDP remains controversial in current studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association of the VDR gene polymorphisms with HDP susceptibility.</p><p>Methods: This meta-analysis follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and a protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022344383) before commencing this review. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched until January 21, 2023. Case-control and cohort studies that reported the association of the VDR gene polymorphisms with HDP were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for non-randomized studies. The odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the five models (allele model, dominant model, recessive model, homozygous model, heterozygous model) were pooled respectively, and subgroup analysis was performed based on ethnicity.</p><p>Results: A total of ten studies were included. The VDR gene ApaI polymorphism was associated with HDP susceptibility in the dominant model (OR: 1.38; 95% CI <span>[1.07-1.79]</span>; P = 0.014) and the heterozygote model (OR: 1.48; 95% CI <span>[1.12-1.95]</span>; P = 0.006). In subgroup analysis, the heterozygote model (OR: 2.06; 95% CI <span>[1.21-3.52]</span>; P = 0.008) of the ApaI polymorphism was associated with HDP in Asians, but not in Caucasians.</p><p>Conclusion: The VDR gene ApaI polymorphism may be associated with HDP susceptibility. Insufficient evidence to support the existence of ethnic differences in this association.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/preeclampsia-vdr-meta-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=could-vitamin-d-be-effective-in-prevention-of-preeclampsia---oct-2021>Could Vitamin D Be Effective in Prevention of Preeclampsia? - Oct 2021</h4><p>Nutrients 2021, 13(11), 3854; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113854>https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13113854</a></p><p>by Elżbieta Poniedziałek-Czajkowska and Radzisław Mierzyńsk</p><p>Chair and Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-954 Lublin, Poland</p><p>(This article belongs to the Special Issue Role of Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnancy Disorders)</p><p>Prevention of preeclampsia (PE) remains one of the most significant problems in perinatal medicine. Due to the possible unpredictable course of hypertension in pregnancy, primarily PE and the high complication rate for the mother and fetus/newborn, it is urgent to offer pregnant women in high-risk groups effective methods of preventing the PE development or delaying its appearance. In addition, due to the association of PE with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in later life, effective preeclampsia prevention could also be important in reducing their incidence. Ideal PE prophylaxis should target the pathogenetic changes leading to the development of PE and be safe for the mother and fetus, inexpensive and freely available. Currently, the only recognized method of PE prevention recommended by many institutions around the world is the use of a small dose of acetylsalicylic acid in pregnant women with risk factors. Unfortunately, some cases of PE are diagnosed in women without recognized risk factors and in those in whom prophylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid is not adequate. Hence, new drugs which would target pathogenetic elements in the development of preeclampsia are studied. Vitamin D (Vit D) seems to be a promising agent due to its beneficial effect on placental implantation, the immune system, and angiogenic factors. Studies published so far emphasize the relationship of its deficiency with the development of PE, but the data on the benefits of its supplementation to reduce the risk of PE are inconclusive. In the light of current research, the key issue is determining the protective concentration of Vit D in a pregnant woman. The study aims to present the possibility of using Vit D to prevent PE, emphasizing its impact on the pathogenetic elements of preeclampsia development.</p><hr><h5 id=preeclampsia-vitamin-dtrials>Preeclampsia Vitamin DTrials</h5><p>more columns are in the PDF</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/pe-rct.jpg alt=image width=500><h5 id=preeclampsia-meta-analyses>Preeclampsia meta-analyses</h5><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/pe-meta.jpg alt=image width=700><h5 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h5><p>Currently, the commonly recommended preeclampsia prophylaxis is the use of low doses of acetylsalicylic acid in high-risk pregnant women and, by some institutions, calcium supplementation in groups with its deficiencies in the diet. Numerous studies are being conducted on the use of other substances and drugs for this purpose, which, due to their properties and mechanisms of action, could prevent the development of preeclampsia. One of these thoroughly studied substances is vitamin D. Based on the results of research explaining its mechanism of action and understanding the reasons and pathophysiology of the development of preeclampsia, it might be postulated that an anti-inflammatory effect of Vit D and its beneficial influence on the endothelium constitutes its potential use in PE prevention. Unfortunately, the results of the randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses are ambiguous. Despite the multitude of studies published on this subject, there are no clear conclusions about its effectiveness in PE prevention which could form the basis for developing universal recommendations.</p><p>In the light of the available data, the following issues regarding the role of vitamin D in preventing preedampsia remain unresolved:</p><ul><li><ol><li>Should the target group for vitamin D supplementation be all pregnant women or only those at high risk?</li></ol></li><li><ol start=2><li>Should it be recommended to test the vitamin D concentration in the periconceptional period and the early first trimester in all pregnant women or a high-risk group?</li></ol></li><li><ol start=3><li>Since when (during the planning period of pregnancy or in the first trimester),</li></ol><ul><li>how long and what doses of vitamin D should be proposed considering the safety of offspring?</li></ul></li><li><ol start=4><li>What vitamin D level in the periconceptional period and the first trimester should be considered sufficient?</li></ol></li></ul><p>These questions may determine the direction of research on vitamin D in the prevention of preeclampsia.</p><p>It seems that the fundamental issue, despite the extensive literature, remains the assessment of Vit D concentration in the periconceptional period and/or the early first trimester and defining levels that would allow reducing the risk of PE development. Women with risk factors for Vit D deficiency such as obesity, kidney, liver, thyroid gland diseases, chronic bowel diseases, autoimmune diseases, asthma, diabetes t.2, hypertension, and chronic glucocorticoids, antiepileptic and antiretroviral drug treatment would benefit the most from screening. It appears that patients with risk factors for PE development and Vit D deficiency may require higher doses of vitamin D than commonly recommended for pregnant women.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/preeclampsia-2021.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=preeclampsia-before-34th-week-increased-risk-of-early-onset-dementia-by-4-x---june-2024>Preeclampsia before 34th week increased risk of early-onset dementia by 4 X - June 2024</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.mdedge.com/obgyn/article/269745/obstetrics/bp-disorder-pregnancy-tied-young-onset-dementia-risk?ecd=WNL_EVE_240629_mdedge">BP Disorder in Pregnancy Tied to Young-Onset Dementia Risk</a> MD Edge</strong></p><hr><h4 id=uspstf-wants-to-screen-all-pregnacies-for-hypertension---feb-2023>USPSTF wants to screen all pregnacies for hypertension - Feb 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.mdedge.com/obgyn/article/261122/obstetrics/uspstf-backs-screening-hypertensive-disorders-pregnancy?ecd=WNL_EVE_230209_mdedge">USPSTF backs screening for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy</a> MDEdge</strong></p><p>U.S. Preventive Services Task Force = USPSTF</p><p><a href=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0428-pregnancy-hypertension.html>16% of US pregnancies had hypertension in 2019</a></p><hr><h4 id=preeclampsia-risk-reduced-15-by-taking-baby-aspirin-daily---nyt-may-2024>Preeclampsia risk reduced 15% by taking baby aspirin daily - NYT May 2024</h4><p><strong>vs 70% reduction with Vitamin D taken once a month - see RCT on this page</strong></p><p>  <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/aspirin-preeclampsia-nyt-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>asthma</span>
