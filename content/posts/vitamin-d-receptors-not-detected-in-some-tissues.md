#### Where is the vitamin D receptor?

Arch Biochem Biophys. 2012 Jul 1;523(1):123-33. [doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2012.04.001.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2012.04.001.) Epub 2012 Apr 6.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and plays a central role in the biological actions of vitamin D. VDR regulates the expression of numerous genes involved in calcium/phosphate homeostasis, cellular proliferation and differentiation, and immune response, largely in a ligand-dependent manner. To understand the global function of the vitamin D system in physiopathological processes, great effort has been devoted to the detection of VDR in various tissues and cells, many of which have been identified as vitamin D targets. This review focuses on the tissue- and cell type-specific distribution of VDR throughout the body.
