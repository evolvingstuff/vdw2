9 Common Types of Magnesium Explained</h1>

<p>

Magnesium is one of the most abundant minerals in the human body and 50% of magnesium is located in the bones. Magnesium, similar to <a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/types-of-zinc/">zinc</a>,<strong> is a necessary cofactor for over 300 biochemical reactions in the human body.</strong> This includes everyday processes, such as muscle building, maintaining nerve function, keeping a healthy heartbeat and sustaining optimal immune system function.</p>

<p>

Because scientific studies are examining the role of magnesium in alleviating or circumventing many commonly occurring chronic ailments, it is important to be educated on the variations in magnesium supplements; especially magnesium orotate, the best form of the mineral supplement.</p>

<p>

Magnesium is not easily absorbed in the body unless first attached to transporting substance. For this reason, many supplement manufacturers have “chelated” magnesium to organic and amino acids. A few of these include magnesium oxide, magnesium sulfate and magnesium carbonate. Quality depends on the amount of magnesium in the supplement and how bioavailable it is. Bioavailability refers to the amount of magnesium in the supplement that can be assimilated by the digestive system and used for cellular activity and health benefit.</p>

9 Types of Magnesium</h2>

<h3>

1. Magnesium Amino Acid Chelate</h3>

<p>

A mineral chelate form of magnesium containing an ion of magnesium oxide connected to a mixture of some other form of amino acid.<br />

This could be a lactate, a glycine, aspartate or arginate, etc. The best chelated amino acid form of magnesium is aspartate or arginate.</p>

<h3>

2. Magnesium Oxide</h3>

<p>

Also referred to as “Magnesia”, magnesium oxide is commonly used medicinally as a laxative and <a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/home-remedies-for-acid-reflux/">relief for acid reflux</a>.<br />

This type of magnesium shows high levels of concentration, but <span style="color:#ff0000;">poor levels of bioavailability (only 4%).</span></p>

<h3>

3. Magnesium Citrate</h3>

<p>

Derived from the magnesium salt of citric acid, this form of magnesium has lower concentration, but a<span style="color:#ff0000;"> high level of bioavalibity (90%).</span><br />

Magnesium citrate is commonly used as to induce a bowel movement, but has also been studied for kidney stone prevention.</p>

<h3>

4. Magnesium Orotate</h3>

<p>

The most effective form of magnesium supplement, created through the use of the mineral salts of orotic acid. Both plants and animals use orotates to create DNA and RNA. Extensive scientific research by Dr. Hans A. Nieper, M.D. shows orotates can penetrate cell membranes, enabling the effective delivery of the magnesium ion to the innermost layers of the cellular mitochondria and nucleus. Magnesium orotate contains many properties that can help protect you and your health, while offering your cells the most readily absorbable form of magnesium on the market today.</p>

<h3>

5. Magnesium Chloride</h3>

<p>

A form of magnesium showing moderate concentrations, but <span style="color:#ff0000;">higher levels of bioavalibity when compared to magnesium oxide</span>.<br />

Magnesium chloride has many uses, most commonly to help manufacture paper, some types of cements and fireproofing agents.</p>

<h3>

6. Magnesium Lactate</h3>

<p>

This type of magnesium shows moderate concentrations, but<span style="color:#ff0000;"> higher levels of bioavalibity as compared to magnesium oxide</span>.<br />

Magnesium lactate is a mineral supplement that is most commonly used for treating digestive issues.<br />

Magnesium lactate should be avoided by those with kidney disease or kidney-related problems.</p>

<h3>

7. Magnesium Sulfate</h3>

<p>

An inorganic form of magnesium with an elemental concentration of 10% and <span style="color:#ff0000;">lower levels of bioavailability.</span><br />

Magnesium sulfate contains magnesium and sulfer and oxygen; it’s commonly referred to as Epsom Salt.</p>

<h3>

8. Magnesium Carbonate</h3>

<p>

This form of magnesium has moderate levels of elemental concentration and<span style="color:#ff0000;"> 30% bioavalibity rates</span>.<br />

Magnesium carbonate has a strong laxative-effect when taken in high dosages.<br />

It is also commonly known as chalk, and is used as a drying agent by pitchers, gymnasts, rock climbers and weight lifters.</p>

<h3>

9. Magnesium Glycinate, Malate &amp; Taurates</h3>

<p>

Chelated forms of magnesium holding moderate to low concentrations and<span style="color:#ff0000;"> higher levels of bioavailability</span>.<br />

All three types of magnesium have a variety of uses, but none are as beneficial as the previous magnesium supplements listed above.</p>

<p>

A magnesium supplement is best taken with calcium, for this reason, I developed <a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/supplements/intracal.html">IntraCal</a>, it provides the best ratio of calcium and magnesium orotate.</p>
