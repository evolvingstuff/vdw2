Background

Sedentary behavior and vitamin D deficiency are independent risk factors for mortality in cancer survivors, but their joint association with mortality has not been investigated.

Methods

We analyzed data from 2914 cancer survivors who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007–2018) and followed up with them until December 31, 2019. Sedentary behavior was assessed by self-reported daily hours of sitting, and vitamin D status was measured by serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels.

Results

Among 2914 cancer survivors, vitamin D deficiency was more prevalent in those with prolonged daily sitting time. During up to 13.2 years (median, 5.6 years) of follow-up, there were 676 deaths (cancer, 226; cardiovascular disease, 142; other causes, 308). The prolonged sitting time was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and noncancer mortality, and vitamin D deficiency was associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cancer mortality. Furthermore, cancer survivors with both prolonged sitting time (≥ 6 h/day) and vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher risk of all-cause (HR, 2.05; 95% CI: 1.54–2.72), cancer (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.47–3.70), and noncancer mortality (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.33–2.74) than those with neither risk factor after adjustment for potential confounders.

Conclusions

In a nationally representative sample of U.S. cancer survivors, the joint presence of sedentary behavior and vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cancer-specific mortality.
