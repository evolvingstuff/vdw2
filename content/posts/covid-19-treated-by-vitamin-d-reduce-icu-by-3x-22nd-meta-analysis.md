Aims: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) of COVID-19 patients.

Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science and medRxiv with terms relative to vitamin D supplementation and COVID-19 was conducted on  **March, 26th , 2021** . Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used for the quantitative assessment of data and random-effects model was applied. To investigate the association between the dose of vitamin D and the outcomes of interest, meta-regression analysis was performed.

Results: 2,078 patients from 9 studies with data on mortality were included (583 received vitamin D supplementation, while 1,495 did not). 61 (10.46%) individuals in the treated group died, compared to 386 (25.81%) in the non-treated group <span>[odds ratio (OR): 0.597; 95% CI: 0.318-1.121; p=0.109]</span>. 860 patients from 6 studies with data on ICU admission were included (369 received vitamin D supplementation, while 491 did not). 

45 (12.19%) individuals in the treated group were admitted to ICU, compared to 129 (26.27%) in the non-treated group  **(OR: 0.326** ; 95%CI: 0.149-0.712; p=0.005). No significant linear relationship between vitamin D dose and log OR of mortality or log OR of ICU admission was observed.

Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates a beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation on ICU admission, but not on mortality, of COVID-19 patients. Further research is urgently needed to understand the benefit of vitamin D in Covid-19.
