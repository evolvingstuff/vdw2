#### Do cancer patients have low levels of vitamin D? asked Perplexity AI Jan 2025

Cancer patients commonly have vitamin D deficiency, with multiple studies showing significantly high prevalence rates:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Prevalence Rates</span>** 

* 87.3% of cancer patients have vitamin D deficiency (levels below 20 ng/mL) &nbsp;[1](https://www.ejmi.org/pdf/Comparison%20of%20Vitamin%20D%20Levels%20Between%20Healthy%20Individuals%20and%20Cancer%20Patients-41195.pdf")

* 88% of palliative care cancer patients show low vitamin D levels &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3233299/)

* 72% of general cancer patients are vitamin D deficient &nbsp;[11](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2773074)

* 75.6% of breast cancer survivors have insufficient vitamin D levels &nbsp;[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Key Findings</span>** 

 **Stage-Specific Impact** 

Stage 4 cancer patients show particularly severe deficiency, with 93.2% having vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL and 73% below 10 ng/mL &nbsp;[|PDF] Comparison of Vitamin D Levels Between Healthy Individuals and ..." &nbsp;[1](https://www.ejmi.org/pdf/Comparison%20of%20Vitamin%20D%20Levels%20Between%20Healthy%20Individuals%20and%20Cancer%20Patients-41195.pdf)

 **Cancer-Specific Patterns** 

* Breast cancer patients show deficiency rates between 62-87%, with triple-negative breast cancer patients having particularly high rates &nbsp;[12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/)

* Melanoma patients who avoid sun exposure are three times more likely to be vitamin D deficient than healthy individuals &nbsp;[5](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2010/10/skin-cancer-patients-more-likely-to-be-deficient-in-vitamin-d-study-finds.html)

 **Contributing Factors** 

Several factors contribute to vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients:

* Reduced sun exposure due to illness and treatment

* Chemotherapy-induced photosensitivity

* Poor appetite and reduced dietary intake

* Potential absorption issues &nbsp;[10](https://www.cancercenter.com/community/blog/2018/07/vitamin-d-an-important-but-elusive-nutrient)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Clinical Significance</span>** 

Low vitamin D levels in cancer patients are associated with:

* Poorer survival rates

* Increased tumor progression

* Higher risk of metastasis

* Reduced quality of life &nbsp;[13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6201256/)

This widespread deficiency suggests that monitoring and potentially supplementing vitamin D levels may be an important aspect of cancer care &nbsp;[7](https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2019/high-dose-vitamin-d-shows-benefit-in-patients-with-advanced-colorectal-cancer)

Simple Summary

Vitamin D plays a vital role in supporting healthy growth and development. Deficiency in this nutrient has been associated with various health problems, including an increased susceptibility to infections and other complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. Pediatric cancer patients are at a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency due to combined effects of illness, treatments, days of hospitalization, and ongoing developmental needs. This study reviewed the medical literature to understand how common vitamin D deficiency is in this type of patient and its potential impact on treatment outcomes, trying to conclude whether they are a risk group for vitamin D impairment. These findings highlight the importance of checking vitamin D levels at diagnosis and throughout treatment, alongside providing supplements when needed, to support better treatment responses and overall health in pediatric oncology patients.

Abstract

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly recognized as a global health concern, with potential implications for cancer development and progression. This systematic review investigated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pediatric cancer patients and its potential impact on clinical outcomes.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, to identify the relevant studies published between 2009 and July 2024. Studies were included if they assessed vitamin D status in pediatric cancer patients and reported on the clinical outcomes. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. 

Results: The review included 20 original articles encompassing a diverse pediatric population with various cancer types. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was observed across the studies. Deficiency was associated with older age and lower socioeconomic status. Several studies reported associations between vitamin D deficiency and the increased risk of infection, poorer treatment response, and decreased survival. 

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in pediatric cancer patients and may negatively impact clinical outcomes. Routine screening for vitamin D deficiency and personalized supplementation strategies should be considered in this population. Further research is needed to establish optimal vitamin D management protocols and evaluate the long-term benefits of vitamin D repletion in pediatric oncology.
