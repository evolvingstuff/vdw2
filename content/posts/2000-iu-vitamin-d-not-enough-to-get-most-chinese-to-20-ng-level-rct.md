**But 800 IU was enough to get most to 12 ng**

PURPOSE:

To determine the dose-response of vitamin D3 supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> among Chinese adults.

METHODS:

In this 5-arm, randomized, double-blinded controlled trial, 76 healthy participants were assigned to orally administrate 0, 400, 800, 1200 or 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for 16 weeks. Serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, biomarkers of liver and renal function were measured at multiple time points.

RESULTS:

The mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D at baseline was 31.6 (8.7) nmol/L, and the dose-response relationship was curvilinear with a plateau around 6 weeks for all doses. At week 16, 25(OH)D was increased by 6.0 (6.5), 21.7 (15.8), 26.3 (12.6), 32.0 (12.8) and 36.3 (26.0) nmol/L for 0, 400, 800, 1200 and 2000 IU/d (all P ≤ 0.002), corresponding to approximately 19, 53, 67, 77 and 80 % of reversion of vitamin D deficiency, respectively. 

 **Daily intake of 800 IU vitamin D3 reached a targeted 25(OH)D ≥ 30 nmol/L in at least 97.5 % of Chinese** , but not a targeted 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L even with 2000 IU/d. Change of 25(OH)D was inversely associated with change of PTH concentration (r = -0.39, P < 0.001) after controlling for age and sex. No between-group differences were observed in terms of the change in serum calcium, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and creatinine (P ≥ 0.22).

CONCLUSIONS:

Supplementation with 400, 800, 1200 or 2000 IU/d vitamin D could improve the vitamin D deficiency with various degrees. Whether 2000 IU/d vitamin D3 would generate a better result without side effect requires more studies with larger samples in future.
