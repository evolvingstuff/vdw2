* [Low Vitamin D Levels Linked to Disease in Two Big Studies](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/low-vitamin-d-levels-linked-to-disease-in-two-big-studies/) New York Times - some reader's comments follow

1. I believe the tone of this article is off. The article speaks of low Vitamin D as the result of an unhealthy lifestyle. However, for decades doctors have advised patients to stay out of the sun and to avoid cholesterol, which would encourage low to no consumption of milk and other Vitamin D rich foods. Their patients have done just that and are now faced with low levels of the vitamin. Shouldn't the medical profession see that this is a problem that they have caused?

1. I think doctors should scale back a bit on "the sun will kill you" type of advice. Yes there is skin cancer, but there's also moderation. It's bad enough that people don't spend enough time outside as it is; drilling guilt into us is making it even worse. My dermatologist tells me to wear sunscreen on my whole body all the time, even in the winter (in Boston!) and even if I'll be indoors all day. And she doesn't want me going to the beach, ever. Seriously?!? She has lost all credibility with me. Pediatricians and books tell me to keep my children away from the sun. Don't trust sunscreen because it's full of chemicals, just avoid the sun, it's safer! Great. So how are we supposed to get our natural vitamin D way up here? How much milk does it take? Winter is 6 months long. When the sun finally comes out, I'm going outside! Let's find the middle ground please!

1. So let me get this straight-doctors will prescribe testosterone for a new, made-up disease called"low T," statins for everyone on the planet as a precaution against high cholesterol and medication for toenail fungus that causes cancer and diabetes BUT they are VERY cautious about recommending a Vitamin D supplement!
