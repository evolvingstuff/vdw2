We included all children under 15 years presenting to the emergency department with low-energy fractures; controls were children without history of fractures from the outpatient department. Conventional X-ray and laboratory blood tests were performed. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum level ≤20 ng/ml, and the mean values were compared through two-sample t-tests. The influence of vitamin D on the fractures was defined using Chi-square test, significance with P-value &lt; 0.05. The relationships between variables and odds of fracture occurrence were examined using logistic regression models. The final sample included 37 cases (30 males, 7 females, 7.4 ± 3.7 years) and 70 control individuals (42 males, 28 females, 7.8 ± 4.6 years) without significant differences regarding age, sex, and month of inclusion.</p><p>Children with fractures had lower levels of vitamin D (21.87 ± 8.40 ng/ml vs. 25.89 ± 7.62 ng/ml) (P = 0.01).</p><p>Vitamin D played a protective role against low-energy fractures (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14; P = 0.02),</p><p>boys showed three times greater fracture risk than girls (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.12-8.07; P = 0.03).</p><p>Finally, vitamin D deficiency correlated with almost five times <strong>increased risk of pediatric low-energy fractures (OR, 4.63</strong> ; 95% CI, 1.92-11.18; P = 0.001). This is the first MENA study establishing a relation between vitamin D deficiency and low-energy fractures among children and adolescents. The findings show the protective role of vitamin D on the pediatric bone and may help physicians preventing morbidity on children and costs on their families and the socioeconomic health system.</p><hr><h4 id=total-fractures-in-children-not-associated-with-low-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-june-2021>Total fractures in children NOT associated with low vitamin D - meta-analysis June 2021</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D level and fractures in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism volume 39, pages 851–857 (2021) <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00774-021-01238-x>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00774-021-01238-x</a></p><p>References are online, Publisher charges $40 for the PDF</p><p>Chong Zheng, Hao Li, Shuai Rong, Liantao Liu, Kepei Zhen & Kewei Li</p><h5 id=suspect-that-this-study-looked-at-total-of-both-low-and-high-energy-fractures>Suspect that this study looked at total of both low and high energy fractures</h5><p>Introduction</p><p>The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between vitamin D levels and the risk of bone fractures in children and adolescents.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched using subject and free words.

It is well described that vitamin D is involved in the regulation of bone mineralization and skeletal homeostasis by the regulation of calcium absorption. The aim of our study was to determine the influence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on forearm fracture falls in a pediatric population, depending on level of energy impact. Additionally, we also aimed to evaluate the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and other tested risk factors for pediatric fractures.</p><p>Methods: We evaluated 50 eligible children aged 3 to 12 years with a forearm fracture. According to energy impact, patients were grouped into low-energy fractures (LEF) and high-energy fractures (HEF) groups. The general characteristics of the patients included age, gender, sport participation, and fractured bone and its localization. We analyzed 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, magnesium, phosphate, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and body mass index (BMI).</p><p>Results: There is a significant difference in the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels distribution between LEF and HEF (p &lt; 0.001) and PTH levels (p = 0.002). For magnesium levels, calcium levels, phosphate levels, and CRP levels, there were no significant differences in their frequency distribution. For the group of patients with LEF, there is a significantly positive correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium levels (p = 0.019) and a borderline significantly positive correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and magnesium levels (p = 0.050). For the group of patients with HEF, there was only a significantly positive correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and PTH levels (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Conclusions: Children with LEF were more frequently insufficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels but had normal calcium levels, compared to the ones with HEF. These findings suggest that LEF and HEF in children might to a certain degree have different pathophysiological mechanisms.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-and-forearm-fractures.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=low-and-high-energy-fractures-in-children--may-2022>Low and high energy fractures in Children- May 2022</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D and Forearm Fractures in Children Preliminary Findings: Risk Factors and Correlation between Low-Energy and High-Energy Fractures</strong>   <a href=10.3390/children905076>10.3390/children905076</a> FREE PDF</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/asthma.html><span class=tag>asthma</span></a>
