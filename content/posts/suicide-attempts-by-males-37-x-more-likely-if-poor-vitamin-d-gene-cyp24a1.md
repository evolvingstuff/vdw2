Objective

Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D might protect from attempted suicide. The study aimed to investigate the associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to vitamin D levels identified in a large genome-wide association study and attempted suicide in rural China.

Methods

This 1:1 matched case–control study included altogether 510 suicide attempters and 510 community controls. 

Genotypes of four target SNPs (

* DHCR7-rs12785878, 

* CYP2R1-rs10741657, 

* GC-rs2282679, and 

* CYP24A1-rs6013897) 

were determined, and a genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed to evaluate the combined effect of them. Demographic and psychological information was acquired through face-to-face interviews.

Results

The A allele of CYP24A1-rs6013897 was significantly associated with attempted suicide (OR = 1.27, 95% CI, 1.03–1.58, P = 0.029), even after adjusting for demographic and psychological confounders (adjusted OR = 1.53, 95% CI, 1.01–2.30, P = 0.043). The GRS analyses revealed a significantly higher risk of attempted suicide with a greater number of low vitamin D alleles (adjusted OR = 1.33, 95% CI, 1.13–1.58, P < 0.001). 

Subgroup analyses stratified by sex indicated that the genetic associations were only significant among males with adjusted  **ORs of 3.77**  (95% CI, 1.56–9.10) for the A allele of rs6013897 and 2.04 (95% CI, 1.32–3.17) for GRS.

Conclusions

Our findings identity CYP24A1-rs6013897 as a potential biomarker for attempted suicide and indicate that a genetic predisposition to lower vitamin D levels may contribute to attempted suicide. It suggests the possibility that vitamin D may have the preventive potential for attempted suicide.
