 **Heat extremes seen raising incidence of congenital abnormalities** 

* Projections for 2025-2035 indicated that incidence of  **congenital heart defects**  could more than double in the Midwest, where the frequency of "extreme heat events" in summer was predicted to rise more than three-fold

#### VitaminDWiki hypothesis

 **Extreme Heat events ==> pregnant women stay indoors ==> less vitamin D ==> increased incidence of many birth defects, such as CHD** 

 **Study noted increased CHD is especially true for Heat Events occurring in the spring (when the body is used to restoring vitamin D levels)**
