#### Osteocalcin: Function, Levels, and 18 Factors that Increase or Decrease It

 **[Self-Hacked](https://www.selfhacked.com/blog/osteocalcin/) Jan 2018** 

*  **Osteocalcin is an important protein that is critical to the formation and maintenance of bones. It also acts as a hormone to adjust insulin and glucose levels, increase testosterone, and improve muscle strength and cognitive function.”** 

#### [Table of Contents of material on web](https://www.selfhacked.com/blog/osteocalcin/)

 **What Is Osteocalcin?** 

 **Osteocalcin Normal Range** 

 **Osteocalcin Effects** 

1) Osteocalcin Builds Strong Bones

2) Osteocalcin Adjusts Insulin and Glucose Levels

3) Osteocalcin Stimulates Testosterone Production

4) Osteocalcin May Improve Muscle Strength

5) Osteocalcin May Improve Brain Function

 **Low Osteocalcin** 

1) Low Osteocalcin Is Associated with Insulin Resistance and Diabetes

2) Low Levels of Osteocalcin May Indicate Heart Disease Risk

3) Low Osteocalcin Is Associated with Hardening of the Arteries (Atherosclerosis)

4) Low Osteocalcin Is Associated with Metabolic Syndrome

5) Low Osteocalcin Is Associated with Obesity

6) Low Osteocalcin Is Associated with Fatty Liver (NAFLD)

 **High Osteocalcin** 

1) High Levels of Osteocalcin May Indicate Osteoporosis

2) High Osteocalcin Is Associated with Diabetes in Pregnancy

3) High Osteocalcin Is Associated with Increased Breast Density

4) High Osteocalcin May Indicate Anemia

 **Factors That Decrease Osteocalcin** 

1) Smoking

2) Glucocorticoids

3) Iron Deficiency

 **Factors That Increase Osteocalcin** 

 **Vitamin K** 

* Vitamin K is necessary to activate osteocalcin in the body. A lack of vitamin K results in a lack of osteocalcin protein in the bones. Vitamin K deficiency is also associated with low bone mineral density and increased risk of fractures <span>[R, R]</span>.

* A placebo-controlled study of 40 healthy young men showed that vitamin K supplements increased osteocalcin levels after just 4 weeks. This improved the body’s use of insulin (by reducing insulin resistance) and the maintenance of healthy glucose levels. These results were consistent with other clinical studies involving the use of vitamin K supplements by young males as well as older women and men <span>[R, R, R]</span>.

* An analysis of blood samples from 896 persons suggested that most people do not receive enough vitamin K from their diet. However, vitamin K can be taken as a supplement, to ensure that the body produces enough osteocalcin. The best type of vitamin K to take for this is vitamin K2, particularly the MK-7 type <span>[R]</span>.

* However, persons who are taking some types of blood-thinning medication (anticoagulants), such as warfarin, must be careful. There is a significant risk that some of these medications will become less effective if vitamin K2 in MK-7 form is taken as well, and so this combination is not advised <span>[R]</span>.

2) Exercise

3) Diet/Calorie Restriction

4)  **Vitamin D** 

* Vitamin D directly stimulates osteocalcin production <span>[R]</span>.

* In a DB-RCT of 76 obese but otherwise healthy menopausal women between the ages of 51 and 63, vitamin D supplements in combination with a calorie-restricted diet increased osteocalcin and improved insulin sensitivity, compared to diet alone <span>[R]</span>.

5) Zinc

6) Manganese

7) Olive Oil

8) Omega-3 Fatty Acids

9) Ellagic Acid

10) Milk Thistle

11) Icariin

12) Insulin Therapy/Low Glucose

13) Alendronate

14) Teriparatide

15) Ibutamoren
