#### Several health problems each reduce productivity by 10 minutes per day  <span style="color:#F00;">($1,600/year)</span>

 **Four-year review of presenteeism data among employees of a large United States health care system:  
 a retrospective prevalence study - 2018** 

This does NOT consider lost productivity resulting from sick leave (flu, colds, etc.)

 **Causes of productivity lost (minutes per day)**

#### Pain reduces productivity by 10 days / year <span style="color:#F00;">($4,000/year)</span>

 **Presenteeism in the workplace: A review and research agenda - 2009** 

 **Definitions of Presenteeism** 

Attending work, as opposed to being absent 

Working elevated hours, thus putting in “face time,” even when unfit 

Being reluctant to work part-time rather than full time 

Being unhealthy but exhibiting no sickness absenteeism 

Going to work despite feeling unhealthy 

Going to work despite feeling unhealthy or experiencing other events that might normally compel absence 

&nbsp; &nbsp;(e.g., child care problems) 

Reduced productivity at work due to health problems 

 **A survey found 28% of employees were in pain on the day surveyed** 

Over 4 weeks, it was estimated that those meeting the pain criterion effectively lost 

* 3.14 days of work due to presenteeism and

* 0.84 days due to absenteeism, 

   * versus 0.29 day presenteeism and 

   * 0.06 days absenteeism for those who did not report pain. 

Annual days of lost work due to presenteeism for just those in pain = 3.14 X 12 = 38 days

Annual days of lost work due to presenteeism for all employees = 38 X 28% = 10 days

"The most burdensome conditions in the aggregate were deemed to be (in order) 

* allergy, 

* neck and spine problems,

* low back pain,  

* depression, and 

* arthritis."

 **"There is considerable agreement across studies that presenteeism   
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; accounts for more aggregate productivity loss than absenteeism."**

#### Elements of the plan

##### Employees are encouraged to improve their health by taking 1 tiny capsule of vitamin D twice a month

##### Employer reduces barriers to getting the vitamin D by letting employee families order it at a discount on Amazon

A bottle retailing for $22 contains 100 capsules = 4 years worth of vitamin D

An employer might choose to subsidize Vitamin D to his employees such that a bottle lasting 4 years costs them only $4

##### Employees learn how they will benefit via education, marketing, workshops, etc.

Be able to get questions asked individually, in a group, online, watching videos. etc.

 **Example questions** 

What dosing is needed if already have a specific health problem, are obese, for child, etc.

Is it toxic?

The number of capsules to take to restore vitamin D levels as to quickly stop flu, colds, pain, etc.

What forms of vitamin D are best for poor guts, etc.?

Do I have a health problem that needs more than just Vitamin D? (Magnesium, Omega-3, Resveratrol, . . . )
