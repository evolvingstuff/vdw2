#### Amazon (US) has >400 plant-based Calcium supplements

 **[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Based-Calcium/s?k=Plant+Based+Calcium)** 

Personally,  I use the Algae Calcium powder from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CZ1RBVB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1?tag=vdw-20) I put the powder in a modified salt shaker, and shake in on my morning cereal

#### Nice 7 year trial of Algae Calcium - 2016

A 7-Year Longitudinal Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of a Vitamin/Mineral Enhanced Plant-Sourced Calcium Supplement

 **Problems with the study** 

1. Not a controlled trial

1. Great decrease in participants during the trial

1. Funded by the supplier

 **But the results are most promising**

#### Plant Calcium has smaller crystals and is 1.5X more bio-available than synthetic Ca - Sept 2021

 **Comparative characterization study of plant based calcium versus synthetic calcium** 

International Journal of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Analysis

Background: Calcium is an essential mineral which supports bone health as well as serves as a major

therapeutic intervention that can prevent and delay the incidence of osteoporosis. Multicellular aquatic

plants like Lithothamnion calcareum are a rich source of plant based calcium.

Aims/Objective: To characterize Plant based calcium and Synthetic calcium sources using sophisticated

analytical techniques.

Material and Methods: Plant based Calcium and Synthetic Calcium sources were subjected to

instrumental analysis such as SEM, ICP-OES and XRD, and comparisons were done followed by

interpretation.

Results and Discussion: In this study, three different instrument techniques like SEM, ICP-OES and XRD were used for the characterization of plant based calcium and synthetic calcium. The results showed that plant based calcium were smaller isotropic crystals as compared to synthetic calcium crystals which were larger and anisotropic. Further, in case of XRD results, plant based calcium is shown to possess two 2θ values, whereas in case of synthetic calcium, it showed a single 2θ value. Further, Magnesium and Boron content were higher in case of plant based calcium as compared to synthetic calcium.

Conclusion: Both Plant based and Synthetic Calcium can be distinguished using SEM, ICP-OES and XRD techniques. Outcomes of this study enlightens the probable reasons for enhanced bioavailability in case of plant based calcium sources as compared to synthetic calcium sources.
