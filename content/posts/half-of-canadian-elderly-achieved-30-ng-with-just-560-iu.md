Population level data on how older individuals living at high latitudes achieve optimal vitamin D status are not fully explored. Our objective was to examine the intake of vitamin D among healthy older individuals with 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations ?75 nmol/L and to describe current sources of dietary vitamin D. 

We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study of 404 healthy men and women  **aged 69 to 83 y**  randomly selected from the NuAge longitudinal study in Québec, Canada. Dietary intakes were assessed by 6 24-h recalls. We examined the contribution of foods and vitamin/mineral supplements to vitamin D intake. 

Serum 25(OH)D was assessed by RIA. We assessed smoking status, season of 25(OH)D measurement, physical activity, and anthropometric and sociodemographic variables. 

Vitamin D status was distributed as follows: 

* 7% (<37.5 nmol/L), 

* 48% (37.5–74.9 nmol/L), and 

* 45% (?75 nmol/L). 

Vitamin D intake from supplements varied across the 3 vitamin D status groups: 0.5, 4.1, and 8.9 µg/d, respectively (P < 0.0001). 

Adding food sources, these total intakes were 4.6, 8.7, and 14.1 µg/d, respectively. In multivariate analysis, vitamin D from foods and supplements and by season was associated with vitamin D status. These healthy, community-dwelling older men and women with 25(OH)D concentrations  **>75 nmol/L had mean intakes of 14.1 µg/d from food and supplements** . Supplement use is an important contributor to achieve a minimal target of 25(OH)D concentration ?75 nmol/L.

## No indication if any of these seniors had dark skin or were overweight

## No indication of change with season.  Perhaps the community-dwelling seniors do not get much sunshine
