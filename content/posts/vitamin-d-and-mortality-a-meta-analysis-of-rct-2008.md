<th>CRD summary</th>

<td>

<p>This  review evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on reducing  mortality from any cause. The authors concluded that ordinary doses of  vitamin D supplements have a positive association with reduced total  mortality rates. Poor reporting of the review methodology and the lack  of a validity assessment mean that the reliability of the authors'  conclusions is unclear.</p>

<tr>

<th>Authors' objectives</th>

<td>

<p>To assess the effect of  vitamin D supplementation on reducing mortality from any health  condition.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Searching</th>

<td>

<p>PubMed, ISI Web of Science,  EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched to November 2006; the  search terms were reported. In addition, manual searches of references  from included studies and selected reviews and books were undertaken. No  language or time restrictions were applied.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Study selection: study designs</th>

<td>

<p>Randomised  controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. Cluster randomised  trials were excluded from the review.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Study selection: specific interventions</th>

<td>

<p>Studies  assessing supplementation with vitamin D2 or vitamin D3, with placebo  or without (open trial), were eligible for inclusion. The included  studies used vitamin D supplements administered orally (on a daily,  weekly or 4-monthly basis) or as a single injection. Daily doses in the  included studies ranged from 300 to 2,000 IU, and study durations ranged  from 6 months to 7 years. The included studies examined vitamin D,  either alone or with calcium supplements. Studies that examined vitamin D  analogues such as D3 (alfacalcidol) were excluded from the review.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Study selection: participants</th>

<td>

<p>Patients with  advanced prostate cancer, chronic renal disease or end-stage renal  disease, or patients undergoing renal dialysis were not eligible for  inclusion. The baseline ages of participants in the included studies  ranged from 33 to 106 years, with the majority being older than 60  years. The included studies used populations thatr included individuals  who were classed as frail and elderly; had undergone a hip fracture  operation; had past low-energy fracture; were insufficient in vitamin D;  were at risk of hip fracture; or had congestive heart failure.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Study selection: outcomes</th>

<td>

<p>The primary  review outcome was total mortality. However, studies were eligible for  inclusion if they reported deaths from any cause separately for the  intervention and control groups. Only one included study reported  all-cause mortality; the majority of studies reported clinical fractures  and/or bone mineral density as the main end point. Only studies that  reported sufficient data to allow the estimation of relative risks (RRs)  and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were eligible for inclusion.</p>

</td>

<tr>

<th>Study selection: how were decisions on the relevance  of primary studies made?</th>

<td>

<p>The authors did not state how the  papers were selected for the review, or how many reviewers performed the  selection.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Validity assessment</th>

<td>

<p>The authors did not  state that they performed a validity assessment, although it appears  that the statistical power of the studies was assessed.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Data extraction</th>

<td>

<p>The authors did not state  how the data were extracted for the review, or how many reviewers  performed the data extraction. Data on all-cause mortality were  extracted from the trials, and RRs and 95% CIs were calculated.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Methods of synthesis: how were the studies combined?</th>

<td>

<p>Summary  RRs were estimated by pooling the study-specific estimates in a  meta-analysis, using a random-effects model. Publication bias was  assessed using the sensitivity analysis of Copas and Shi and a funnel  plot regression on sample size, weighted by the inverse of the pooled  variance.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Methods of synthesis: how were differences between  studies investigated?</th>

<td>

<p>Statistical heterogeneity between the  studies was investigated using the chi-squared test and the I-squared  statistic. A subgroup analysis based on the statistical power of the  studies was conducted. Further subgroup analyses were conducted on the  basis of length of follow-up, dose and formulation of vitamin D, and use  of concomitant supplements. Sensitivity analyses, which included a  cluster randomised trial or excluded a quasi-randomised study, were also  carried out.</p>

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<th>Results of the review</th>

<td>

<p>Eighteen RCTs  (n=57,311) were included in the review.</p>

<p>The authors reported that there was no evidence of publication bias  (p=0.37 using the method of Copas and Shi; p=0.77 using the method of  Macaskill et al.) and no indication of heterogeneity (p=0.52).</p>

<p>Pooled results from all trials indicated that vitamin D supplements  significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI:  0.87, 0.99), although none of the studies reported mortality as the main  end point. Subgroup analysis showed that 9 trials with appropriate  statistical power supported a significant reduction (RR 0.92, 95% CI:  0.86, 0.99), while 9 trials with low statistical power favoured the  control (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.79, 2.73).</p>

<tr>

<th>Authors' conclusions</th>

<td>

<p>There appears to be a  positive association between the intake of ordinary doses of vitamin D  supplements and reductions in total mortality rates.</p>

<tr>

<th>CRD commentary</th>

<td>

<p>The review question was  clear and appropriate inclusion criteria were reported for the  interventions, outcomes and study designs. Relevant literature searches  were conducted using electronic databases and manual searching.  Publications were not restricted by language or date, thus reducing the  possibility that some relevant studies were not included in the review.  The authors also reported carrying out an analysis of possible  publication bias. The authors did not report using methods designed to  reduce bias and error in the selection of studies or extraction of data  for the review. The absence of a validity assessment means that the  reliability of the included studies and their subsequent synthesis is  unclear.</p>

<p>It appears that appropriate methods were used to pool the results and  to investigate statistical heterogeneity, although there was a  considerable degree of clinical heterogeneity between the studies. The  poor reporting of the review methodology, and the fact that no validity  assessment was undertaken, mean that the reliability of the authors'  conclusions is unclear.</p>

<tr>

<th>Implications of the review for practice and research</th>

<td>

<p>Practice:  The authors did not state any implications for practice.</p>

<p>Research: The authors stated that future studies should explore the  relationship between baseline vitamin D status, dose of vitamin D  supplements, and total mortality rates. Population-based,  placebo-controlled randomised trials in people 50 years or older should  also be undertaken, with longer treatment duration and with total  mortality as the main end point.</p>
