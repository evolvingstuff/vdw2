#### Preoperative Vitamin D Repletion in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Cost-Effectiveness Model

The Journal of Arthroplasty Volume 35, Issue 5, May 2020, Pages 1379-1383 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2019.12.037

 **50,000 IU of vitamin D weekly for 8 weeks cut the infection rate in half** 

Background

Recent studies have identified vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> < 20 ng/L) as a potentially modifiable risk factor for prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in arthroplasty. The purpose of this study is to determine whether implementation of preoperative 25(OH)D repletion is cost-effective for reducing PJI following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods

A cost estimation predictive model was generated to determine the utility of both selective and nonselective 25(OH)D repletion in primary TKA to prevent PJI. Input data on the incidence of 25(OH)D deficiency, relative complication rates, and costs of serum 25(OH)D repletion and 2-stage revision for PJI were derived from previously published literature identified using systematic review and publicly available data from Medicare reimbursement schedules. Mean, lower, and upper bounds of 1-year cost savings were computed for nonselective and selective repletion relative to no repletion.

Results

Selective preoperative 25(OH)D screening and repletion were projected to result in $1,504,857 (range, $215,084-$4,256,388) in cost savings per 10,000 cases. Nonselective 25(OH)D repletion was projected to result in $1,906,077 (range, $616,304-$4,657,608) in cost savings per 10,000 cases. With univariate adjustment, nonselective repletion is projected to be cost-effective in scenarios where revision for PJI costs ≥$10,636, incidence of deficiency is ≥1.1%, and when repletion has a relative risk reduction ≥4.2%.

Conclusion

This predictive model supports the potential role of 25(OH)D repletion as a cost-effective mechanism of reducing PJI risk in TKA. Given the low cost of 25(OH)D repletion relative to serum laboratory testing, nonselective repletion appears to be more cost-effective than selective repletion. Further prospective investigation to assess this modifiable risk factor is warranted.

#### Loading dose lasts about 3 months - should have followed up with 50,000 IU bi-weekly

---

#### Note: Study does not consider larger savings due to: recovery weeks faster, decreased need for physical therapy

Note: My wife is quickly recovering from knee replacement surgery in late Oct 2024

I had given her 400,000 IU [sublingual nanoemulsion](/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-is-faster-and-better-many-studies)  vitamin D 1 week before her surgery

And also applied about 20,000 IU of Vitamin D topically near to her cut on a weekly basis.

Note: Her normal vitamin D level is > 100 ng/mL

#### Vitamin D improves Total Knee Arthroplasty - Meta-analysis April 2024

 **Vitamin D Deficiency Leads to Poorer Health Outcomes and Greater Length of Stay After Total Knee Arthroplasty and Supplementation Improves Outcomes - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**

Background: 

Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly identified as a predictor of poorer outcomes in musculoskeletal disease affecting as many as 1 in 4 people. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Methods: 

A targeted search of terms related to vitamin D and TKA outcomes was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and British Orthopaedic Association databases. The results were analyzed using forest plots with I2 heterogeneity statistics and pooled effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results: 

A total of 146,054 patients with 150,107 TKRs were analyzed in 10 studies that complied with the inclusion criteria, of which 3 were suitable for meta-analysis. Of these, 4 of the 10 studies showed that vitamin D deficiency resulted in poorer functional outcome scores (Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Knee Society Scoring System, and American Knee Society scores), as well as increased risk of revision surgery, incidence of joint infection, and postoperative stiffness. Meta-analysis of length of hospital stay (LOS) demonstrated a significant increase in LOS in patients with vitamin D deficiency (standardized mean difference, −0.54, 95% CI, −0.69 to −0.38, p < 0.00001).  **Furthermore, outcomes were improved with vitamin D supplementation in 6 of 10 studies.** 

Conclusion: 

Vitamin D deficiency results in poorer outcomes of primary TKA, with improved outcomes after supplementation. Further studies should examine the role of preoperative vitamin D screening and/or perioperative supplementation in primary TKA and standardize outcome measures to assess their effect.
