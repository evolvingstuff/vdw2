## [First UK Vitamin D day launched](http://babyworld.co.uk/2013/03/first-uk-vitamin-d-day-launched/). Yet

* [Dairy Council of UK](http://www.milk.co.uk/page.aspx?intPageID=71) UK milk does NOT have vitamin D

* [UK doctors call for more Vitamin D in foods](http://www.just-food.com/the-just-food-blog/uk-doctors-call-for-more-vitamin-d-in-foods_id2340.aspx) Dec 2012

### One of the few UK milks to be fortified with vitamin D is [Growing Up Milk](http://growingupmilkinfo.com/%20) (are there others?)

* Which has only 100 IU in 300 ml of milk

* US recommendation is 600 IU daily from age 0 to 70

> to get up to the US RDA, the infant would need to drink 1.8 liters of Growing Up Milk each day

* Many believe that the vitamin D dose should be proportional to weight, so even more would be needed as child gets older.
