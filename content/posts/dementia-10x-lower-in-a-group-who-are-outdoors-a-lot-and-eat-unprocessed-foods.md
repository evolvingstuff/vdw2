#### Amazonian Indigenous Groups Have World's Lowest Rate of Dementia

[By Medscape Staff](https://www.mdedge.com/neurology/article/252711/alzheimers-cognition/amazonian-indigenous-groups-have-worlds-lowest-rate?ecd=WNL_eve_220314_mdedge)

Lack of contact with the outside world and an active lifestyle could play a role in why indigenous groups in the remote Amazon of Bolivia have some of the lowest rates of dementia in the world.   

###  **What to know:** 

* Only about  **1% of members of the Tsimane and Moseten peoples of the Bolivian Amazon suffer from dementia,**  compared with  **11% of people aged 65 and older in the United States** .

* Underscoring  **the profound relationship between lifestyle and cognitive health** , something about the  **preindustrial subsistence lifestyle of the groups appears to protect**  older tribe members from dementia.

*  **The rate of [mild cognitive impairment](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1136393-overview)** generally accepted as typical in aging is  **comparable between the tribes and rates in developed countries**  such as the United States.

*  **The Tsimane and Moseten people remain very physically active throughout their lives**  by fishing, hunting, and farming and  **experience less brain atrophy than their American**  and European peers.

*  **Indigenous populations elsewhere in the world have been found to have high rates of dementia** , which are attributed to  **more contact**  with their nonindigenous neighbors and  **adoption of their lifestyles.**
