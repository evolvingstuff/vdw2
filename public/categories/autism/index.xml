&lt;p>Evidence is mounting that vitamin D deficiency is intimately involved in autism. We report on autism prevalence by US state for those aged 6–17 y in 2010 with respect to indices of solar UV-B (UVB) doses. We calculated autism prevalence rates for white, black and Asian Americans by using total prevalence and relative populations of minors for each ethnic group by state. Analyses omit AK and HI (considered extreme cases), WY (no data), along with AZ and ND for black Americans (low numbers) and DC, ME, MT, ND and SD for Asian Americans (low numbers). For white Americans, the regression coefficient for solar UVB doses and autism prevalence ranged from -0.52 in January to -0.57 in October. For black Americans, the regression coefficient for latitude was 0.61, whereas those for solar UVB ranged from -0.55 to -0.61. For Asian Americans, the values for solar UVB ranged from -0.28 to -0.38. The inverse correlation between solar UVB and autism prevalence is similar to that for many types of cancer in the US. The journal literature indicates that adverse effects on fetal brain development during pregnancy due to vitamin D deficiency can explain these findings. However, we cannot rule out a role of vitamin D deficiency in early life. These results add to the evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be an important risk factor for autism and suggest that pregnant women and autistic individuals raise their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations above 30 ng/ml.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Autistic measure 5X more likely if low vitamin D in second trimester</title><link>/posts/autistic-measure-5x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-in-second-trimester.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/autistic-measure-5x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-in-second-trimester.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="maternal-vitamin-d-levels-and-the-autism-phenotype-among-offspring">Maternal Vitamin D Levels and the Autism Phenotype Among Offspring.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from the skeletal health affection, vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a potential environmental factor triggering for some autoimmune disorders. Vitamin D might play a role in the regulation of the production of auto-antibodies. Immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D may act not only through modulation of T-helper cell function, but also through induction of CD4+CD25 high regulatory T-cells. We are the first to investigate the relationship between serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) auto-antibodies in autistic children.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No noticeable decrease in Autism in child with high level of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/no-noticeable-decrease-in-autism-in-child-with-high-level-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-noticeable-decrease-in-autism-in-child-with-high-level-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="dr-cannell-highlightshttpblogvitamindcouncilorg20120710dear-dr-cannell-no-improvement-with-vitamin-d20">&lt;a href="http://blog.vitamindcouncil.org/2012/07/10/dear-dr-cannell-no-improvement-with-vitamin-d/%20">Dr. Cannell highlights&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The main reason scientists will not accept case reports on vitamin D improving autism is that scientists know (correctly) that autism is a genetic disease. Everyone knows that genetic diseases are generally incurable because we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to remove the bad genes and insert some good ones. I left medical school thinking of my genome as something I inherited at birth and left to my children in the marriage bed, without giving much thought to what my genome does for me in between.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
