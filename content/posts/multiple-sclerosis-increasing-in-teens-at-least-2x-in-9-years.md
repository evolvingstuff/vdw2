Background

The onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) during childhood or adolescence is increasingly recognized in the United States. Administrative databases quantify healthcare utilization as measured by hospital admissions, providing insight into the impact of MS in the pediatric population.

Objective

We examine the frequency of hospital admissions for pediatric MS in the US using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database.

Methods

Data was extracted from the PHIS database using the ICD-9 code for MS (340.00) and reviewed to verify case ascertainment. Mean, median, and range values were determined for the number of inpatient hospitalizations per patient, number of days in the hospital, and cost of each encounter. A trend analysis was performed to evaluate the annual frequency of MS-related admissions over the study period.

Results

After case verification, the PHIS database extraction reported 2068 hospital inpatient encounters for 1422 unique pediatric MS patients between 2004 and 2013. The median number of hospitalizations per patient was 2 with a median hospital stay of 4 days. Admission rates for MS increased from 2.37 per 10,000 in 2004 to 4.13 per 10,000 in 2013.

Conclusion

The number of admissions due to pediatric MS has increased since the start of the PHIS database collection, concurrent with increased disease awareness and the establishment of dedicated pediatric MS centers.

 **Highlights** 

The Pediatric Health Information System database was extracted to determine the hospital admission rate for pediatric MS in the U.S.

* The hospital admission rate due to pediatric MS has increased from 2.37 per 10,000 patients in 2004 to 4.13 per 10,000 patients in 2013.

* Although the number of pediatric MS admissions has steadily increased in patients over 11, the number has remained relatively stable in the under 11 age group.

* Pediatric MS is a serious illness associated with frequent hospitalization and with substantive health care costs (costs averaged $38,000 per admission).

 **Clipped from PDF**  “. . . we have underestimated children with MS who were hospitalized for their incident MS attack, but not hospitalized subsequently once their MS diagnosis was confirmed (ie: none of their further relapses required hospital care)”

#### Pediatric-Onset Multiple Sclerosis: A Single Center Study – Dec 2017

Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS), once thought to be rare, is now being diagnosed in increasing numbers in children. Despite improvements to diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis and management of POMS remains challenging. The aim of this study is to retrospectively describe a growing POMS patient population seen at a single center over a 13 year period. Epidemiologic, clinical, neuroimaging, laboratory features and therapeutic management and outcome data were collected and analyzed. These data support associations between MS and environmental triggers such as obesity and vitamin D deficiency. Presenting symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory findings were consistent with the existing literature; however, the prevalence of cortical lesions and abnormal saccadic pursuit is higher than other reports. Data also demonstrate a shift in practice from first- to second-line therapies over the observed period.
