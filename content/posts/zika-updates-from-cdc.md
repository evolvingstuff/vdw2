#### [KEY MESSAGES – ZIKA VIRUS DISEASE](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/pdfs/zika-key-messages.pdf) updated Sept 6, 2016

* "Mosquito eggs can survive drying out for up to 8 months. In the far south, like southern Florida and Texas, mosquitoes can be active year round. In those areas that stay warm year round, their abundance is driven by wet/dry seasons and not as much by temperature. In South Florida, the rainy season ends around the end of October/early November."

* "In some places, such as Puerto Rico, where  **permethrin**  products have been used for years in mosquito control efforts, mosquitoes have become resistant to it. In areas with high levels of resistance, use of permethrin and related products is not likely to be effective. "
