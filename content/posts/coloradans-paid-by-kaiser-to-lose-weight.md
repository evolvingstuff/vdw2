# Kaiser in April 2011 started paying people in Colorado when they lose weight

This is everyone in the state who signs up, not just Kaiser customers

Kaiser is jump starting [the weigh and win program](http://www.weighandwin.com) with $500,000 and hopes that other groups will carry it on.

People joining the program get their weight measured quarterly at 12 kiosks around the state. 

Quarterly payments range from 5% loss = $15 up to 30% loss = $150

Program is being run by Dr. Eric France, Kaiser's chief of population care and prevention services.

Dr. France works in Colorado and actively supports use of bikes.

## Benefits to Kaiser of this program appear to be:

* Current Kaiser customers may lose weight 

> Save Kaiser money by reducing medical needs

* Reduce turnover of current Kaiser customers  by increased respect for company and longer life

> Bigger market share

* Gain new customers as individuals or as groups ==> bigger market share

People do not have to be near a kiosk to appreciate Kaiser

## It is interesting to speculate how Kaiser chose Colorado for the pilot project

### Colorado has the least obesity of the US

### Colorado has the highest mean elevation in the US (6800 feet) - and probably the most annual UV of any state.

Note: Colorado area has more than North Florida, and much less heat

&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps people in Colorado get the most UVB/vitamin D of any US state

### Vitamin D <a href="/posts/reduces-obesity-in-about-13-of-overweight-women" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 710">reduces obesity in about 1/3 of overweight women</a>

## Kaiser Colorado

* 515,000 members (which is 10% of the 5 million people living in Colorado)

* named “Highest in Member Satisfaction” among Commercial Health Plans by J.D. Power and Associates for the third straight year. 

* top-ranked private health plan in Colorado

## Brainstorm on what Kaiser could do in a similar program with vitamin D

Give away, or provide at low cost, vitamin D capsules 

Provide for vitamin D for just customers or for everyone (in area, state, country)

Provide to all people or just those at high risk

Could even have KP printed on each capsule - great reminder
