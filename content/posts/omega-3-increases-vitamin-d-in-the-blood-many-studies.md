Omega-3 increases levels of active vitamin D 

Active vitamin D is the form which the body actually used

Active vitamin D is not measured by standard vitamin D tests

Omega-3 is thus especially useful to get vitamin D to the body if the kidney is not functioning properly

Abstract: The high incidence of cardiovascular disease and vitamin D deficiency in chronic kidney disease patients is well known. Vitamin D activation by omega-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation may explain the cardioprotective effects exerted by omega-3 FA. We hypothesized that omega-3 FA and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) supplementation may increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) levels compared to 25(OH)D supplementation alone in hemodialysis (HD) patients that have insufficient or deficient 25(OH)D levels. We enrolled patients that were treated for at least six months with 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL (NCT01596842). Patients were randomized to treatment for 12 weeks with cholecalciferol supplemented with omega-3 FA or a placebo. Levels of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were measured after 12 weeks. The erythrocyte membrane FA contents were also measured. Levels of 25(OH)D were increased in both groups at 12 weeks compared to baseline. The 1,25(OH)2D levels at 12 weeks compared to baseline showed a tendency to increase in the omega-3 FA group. The oleic acid and monounsaturated FA content decreased, while the omega-3 index increased in the omega-3 FA group. Omega-3 FA supplementation may be partly associated with vitamin D activation, although increased 25(OH)D levels caused by short-term cholecalciferol supplementation were not associated with vitamin D activation in HD patients.

#### Previous publication by same authors - 2012

3 grams of Omega-3 fatty acids increased active vitamin D in the blood in people who could not generate active vitamin D with their kidneys. 

Calcitriol (1,25(OH)?D) concentrations increased from 17 pg/ml to 28 pg/ml after sixth months

The Omega-3 either increased production elsewhere in body or reduced destruction.

#### Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation increases 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and fetuin-A levels in dialysis patients.

Vitamin D deficiency, low levels of fetuin-A, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are related to vascular calcification, which is associated with cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acid (FA), which has cardioprotective properties, modifies vitamin D status, fetuin-A, and FGF-23 levels in dialysis patients. In a randomized, open-label, controlled study, a total of 47 patients treated with dialysis for at least 1 year were randomized to treatment for 6 months with omega-3 FAs (Omacor, 3 g/d; Pronova, Sandefjord, Norway) or a control group. Levels of fetuin-A and FGF-23 were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mean age of the enrolled patients was 57.4 ± 10.4 years, and mean dialysis duration was 46.5 ± 28.1 months. Twenty-seven hemodialysis patients and 16 peritoneal dialysis patients finished this trial. After 6 months, the levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and fetuin-A were significantly increased in the group taking the omega-3 FA supplement compared with baseline. Levels of calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, FGF-23, and lipid profiles were not significantly changed in the omega-3 FA-supplemented group after 6 months compared with baseline. The erythrocyte membrane contents of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were significantly increased, and oleic acid content was significantly decreased in the omega-3 FA-supplemented group after 6 months compared with baseline. Regarding vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease, omega-3 FA supplementation may have a clinical benefit caused by activating vitamin D, increasing fetuin-A levels, and modifying erythrocyte membrane FA contents in dialysis patients.
