Vol. 19 No. 8</p><p>Focus on Colon Cancer <a href=http://www.cancernetwork.com/colorectal-cancer/content/article/10165/1636781>http://www.cancernetwork.com/colorectal-cancer/content/article/10165/1636781</a></p><p>By SHALMALI PAL | August 10, 2010</p><p>Investigators at Memorial-Sloan Kettering plan to tease out exactly how much vitamin D is enough to improve survival prospects.</p><p>Numerous epidemiological studies have strongly suggested that vitamin D has a protective effect against cancer, including breast, prostate, and colon. But the data for these studies were gathered before the cancer diagnosis (see Related Reading below). Researchers at New York&rsquo;s Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have, for the first time, documented levels at the time of cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Kathleen Wesa, MD, and colleagues conducted a retrospective study of baseline vitamin D levels in newly diagnosed, stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to determine if serum levels at diagnosis could predict survival. Dr. Wesa is a physician-scientist in the integrative medicine service at MSKCC. One of her co-authors is Barrie Cassileth, PhD, chief of the integrative medicine service.</p><p>&ldquo;Vitamin D levels of > 40 ng/ml are considered optimal for bone health, and recent data suggest that levels near 40 ng/mL may increase survival in patients with breast cancer. The optimal serum level of vitamin D for CRC patients is not known,&rdquo; wrote Dr. Wesa and colleagues (ASCO 2010 abstract 3615).</p><p>Frozen sera samples from the MSKCC sera bank were used for this analysis. The first 250 patients with serial plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) drawn within 30 days of a stage IV CRC diagnosis, and with survival data available, were included and vitamin D levels were measured. CEA measurements were obtained between 2005 and 2006.</p><p>According to the results, of the 250 patients, 153 had died as of April 2009. The median vitamin D level for all patients was 21.5 ng/mL, but the majority of patients (83%) were vitamin D deficient, which was defined as levels below 30 ng/mL. Only seven patients had serum vitamin D levels above 40 ng/mL.</p><h2 id=vitamin-d-has-a-moment-in-the-sun-which-was-a-sidebar>Vitamin D has a moment in the sun (which was a sidebar)</h2><ul><li>Two recent neurological studies found that high levels of vitamin D may protect against Parkinson&rsquo;s disease while low levels were associated with substantial cognitive decline in the elderly. This research builds on the body of literature that has also identified vitamin D as a protective agent in the heart—low levels seem to predispose people to hypertension and chronic vascular inflammation—and in the skeletal system (Arch Neurol 67:808-811, 2010; Arch Intern Med 170:1135-1141, 2010; Recenti Prog Med 101:202-211, 2010; Clin Biochem online, June 17, 2010).</li></ul><p>–––––––––––––––––––</p><p>In univariate analysis, vitamin D was significantly associated with survival (P = .036). Patients with low vitamin D levels had survival outcomes that were about 1.5 times worse than those with normal levels. The authors concluded that most patients with newly diagnosed stage IV CRC are vitamin D deficient at the time of diagnosis and that higher vitamin D levels are associated with better survival.</p><p>Whether aggressive vitamin D repletion would improve outcomes in deficient CRC patients is not known, the authors stated. Dr. Wesa pointed out that trials using other isolated vitamin supplementation, or in mega-doses have not necessarily shown benefit and in some cases have been detrimental, such as with beta-carotene supplementation in male smokers.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is necessarily appropriate for everyone to take high levels of vitamin D supplementation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We do not yet know what optimal serum vitamin D levels are for the cancer patient. Certainly low levels are associated with worse outcomes in many cancers, but the only way to answer the question of whether normalizing low vitamin D levels improve cancer outcomes is with a clinical trial. What may be most beneficial is for people throughout their lifetime to maintain normal levels of vitamin D for promoting health and wellness.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr. Wesa&rsquo;s group is currently enrolling vitamin D-deficient CRC patients in an ongoing phase II clinical trial that will look at what dose of vitamin D is required to achieve and maintain adequate vitamin D levels. Dr. Wesa said that they anticipate having preliminary results in approximately the next 12 months.</p><h1 id=heading></h1><h1 id=new-european-study-reiterates-relationship-between-prediagnostic-vitamin-d-and-colon-cancer>New European study reiterates relationship between prediagnostic vitamin D and colon cancer</h1><p>The large-scale, long-term European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) trial has collected data on prediagnostic vitamin D levels from more than 52,000 participants in several European countries, including Denmark, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. A multinational group of researchers mined the EPIC database to take a closer look at the link between prediagnostic circulating vitamin D levels and the CRC risk (BMJ online, January 21, 2010).</p><p>For this nested case-control study, the authors focused on 1,248 cases of incident CRC that developed after enrollment into the cohort, and matched the cases to 1,248 healthy controls. Circulating vitamin D concentration was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Not surprisingly, the researchers came up with a strong inverse association between levels of prediagnostic vitamin D and CRC risk in this population. Lower levels (&lt; 25 nmol/l) were associated with higher CRC risk, and higher concentrations (? 100 nmol/l) were associated with a lower CRC risk.</p><p>However, the investigators also found that a <strong>higher consumption of dietary vitamin D was not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer</strong> . The optimal level of vitamin D supplementation still needs to be established through randomized trials before any change is made to public health recommendations, they said.</p><p>Visit <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809840>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809840</a> / to obtain a free copy of this study.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/blood-levels.html><span class=tag>blood levels</span></a>
