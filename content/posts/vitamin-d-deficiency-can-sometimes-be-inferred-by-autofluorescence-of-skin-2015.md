#### Skin which is illuminated at one wavelength is found to give off light at other wavelengths. The amount and color of light emitted appears to be associated with the degree of vitamin D deficiency in various diseases

* [Autofluorescence](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Autofluorescence) Wikipedia

> Autofluorescence is the natural emission of light by biological structures such as mitochondria and lysosomes when they have absorbed light

> The autofluorescence of human skin can be used to measure the level of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which are present in higher quantities during several human diseases.
