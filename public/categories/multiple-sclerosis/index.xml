!Interferon-? and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D interact to modulate relapse risk in MS.
Neurology. 2012 Jul 17;79(3):254-60. Epub 2012 Jun 13.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether interferon-? (IFN-?) medication use is associated with vitamin D levels and whether the two interact in exerting effects on relapse risk.

METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 178 persons with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) living in southern Tasmania in 2002-2005, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured biannually, with assessment by questionnaire for relevant factors, including IFN-? treatment.

RESULTS: Subjects reporting IFN-? use had significantly higher mean 25(OH)D than persons who did not (p &amp;lt; 0.001). This was mediated by an interaction between personal sun exposure and IFN-?, with treated persons realizing nearly __three times 25(OH)D per hour of sun__ exposure of persons not on therapy. The association between 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D did not differ by IFN-? therapy (p = 0.82). 

25(OH)D was associated with a reduced relapse risk only among persons on IFN-? (p &amp;lt; 0.001). 

Importantly, IFN-? was only protective against relapse among persons with higher 25(OH)D (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.98]), while among 25(OH)D-insufficient persons, IFN-? increased relapse risk (HR 2.01 [95% CI 1.22-3.32]).

CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that IFN-? therapy is associated with greater production of vitamin D from sun exposure, suggesting part of the therapeutic effects of IFN-? on relapse in MS may be through modulation of vitamin D metabolism. These findings suggest persons being treated with IFN-? should have vitamin D status monitored and maintained in the sufficiency range. Classification of evidence: This study provided Class III evidence that IFN-? is associated with reduced risk of relapse, and this effect may be modified by a positive effect of IFN-? on serum 25(OH)D levels.

Background: High vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of relapses and disease progression in multiple sclerosis.

Methods: This 96-week randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone mineral density in persons with multiple sclerosis. Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly raised median serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) to 121 nmol/L. The modified intention to treat analysis included 35 persons in the vitamin D3 group and 33 in the placebo group. Participants were age 21 to 50 years and fully ambulatory (median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 2.5). We studied the effect of supplementing vitamin D3 on the exploratory outcomes annualised relapse rate (ARR), EDSS, multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC) components, grip strength, and fatigue.

Results: After 96 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in ARR (absolute difference 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; p = 0.25), EDSS (absolute difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.35; p = 0.97), MSFC components, grip strength, or fatigue.

Conclusion: Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly did not result in beneficial effects on the measured multiple sclerosis-related outcomes. This study was not powered to address clinical outcomes, but none of the results were suggestive of an effect in this unselected population of fully ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis.
