 **[D is for Debacle - The Crucial Story of Vitamin D and Human Health](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pK0dccQ38)**  

(Was presented to ~100 engineers in Ireland Dec 2014)

Following a long period of study, and leveraging the knowledge of the foremost experts in the field, I can now release what I believe is the single most comprehensive explanation of the Vitamin D imperative. Arguably, no single other factor is more important for human health and longevity - and it has been underestimated for generations. This Seminar is hugely important to Mothers & their Children particularly, to avoid serious chronic diseases of childhood and beyond. As before, I am donating this for free - and I only ask one thing in return: if you find it informative, please forward the link widely to help others. In this instance I believe that you will indeed be helping them in a profound way. Thank you.

 **About him** 

I completed a Chemical Engineering degree originally and have subsequently spent 25 years primarily in Engineering Lead and Engineering Manager positions.  I have worked in the Medical Device, Special Purpose Equipment and Electronic Component industries, always gravitating towards the most complex interactions where the Physics comes alive.  My specialty throughout has been leadership in Complex Problem Solving Methodology (Comparative Analysis, Mechanistic Analysis and Experimental/Statistical Inference) - the ultimate destination was always Root Cause Resolution in the minimum timeframe.

Following less-than-ideal blood test results mid last year, I went back to my Biochemical Engineering roots and intensively studied the mechanistic physics and primary drivers of Dyslipidemia, elevated GGT and Serum Ferritin; as the journey became a fixation I also analysed several hundred related papers and studies carried out over the past 5 decades, and a few prior to this period.  I found the value of the technical expertise gained during my career to be of paramount, indeed crucial importance in this odyssey. I thus realized that to be successful in determining root cause and solution in this complex arena, required far more than a general medical background.
