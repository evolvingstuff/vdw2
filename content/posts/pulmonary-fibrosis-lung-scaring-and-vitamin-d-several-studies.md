Introduction: Vitamin D (VitD) is a steroid hormone that exhibits anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in chronic lung diseases. Its role in lung fibrosis is largely unknown.

Aim: To investigate the role of VitD in lung fibrosis.

Patients and Methods: Between January 2015 and February 2018, we prospectively enrolled 133 patients (97 male, mean age (years)+SD: 70.9+9) with various forms of fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) (IPF/ATS-ERS 2011, n=93, non-IPF ILDs, n=40) of various severity (GAP score: 3). VitD (25(OH)D) plasma levels were measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) under standardized protocol.

Results: There was no significant difference in VitD levels between IPF and non-IPF samples (18 vs 17.05 ng/ml, p=0.9). VitD levels were correlated with disease severity, as assessed by FVC%predicted (r=0.43, p<0.001) and DLCO%predicted (r=0.55, p<0.001) and were predictive of mortality (HR:3.6, p<0.01) (Figure 1). Pre-treatment of MLFs with VitD (1μΜfor 24hrs) was associated with reduced responsiveness to pro-fibrotic stimuli (TGFB1-10 ng/ml-6hrs), as assessed by reduced mRNA levels of collagen1a1 and a-smooth muscle actin. Treatment with VitD attenuated TGFB1-induced smad3 phosphorylation.

Conclusions: VitD could serve as a prognosticator and potential therapeutic target in patients with fibrotic ILDs. Further studies are needed.

#### Vitamin D and Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Review of Molecular Mechanisms – Sept 2019

Int J Clin Exp Pathol, 12 (9), 3171-3178 2019 Sep 1 eCollection 2019

Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious interstitial disease characterized by initial diffuse alveolar inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, ECM accumulation, and the destruction of normal pulmonary tissues, whose etiology remains unknown and therapeutic options remain limited. The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency is increasing and has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis. In recent years, many studies focused on the mechanistic pathway of Vitamin D in the prevention of fibrosis. This review highlights the current evidence on the molecular mechanisms of Vitamin D in pulmonary fibrosis. We want to provide new clues to the clinical management of pulmonary fibrosis.
