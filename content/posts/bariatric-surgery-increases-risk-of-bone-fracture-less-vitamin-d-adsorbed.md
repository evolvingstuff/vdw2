#### Does weight loss surgery up the risk for bone fractures?

 **[MDEdge](https://www.mdedge.com/endocrinology/article/263421/obesity/does-weight-loss-surgery-risk-bone-fractures?ecd=WNL_MDIQFFF_230609_mdedge)** 

* "The relative risk for fracture after RYGB and BPD-DS is reported to be  **1.2-2.3**  (that is, 20%-130% more than normal), whereas fracture risk after sleeve gastrectomy is still under study with some conflicting results. Fracture risk starts to increase 2-3 years after surgery and peaks at 5-plus years after surgery."

* "Weight loss surgery is currently recommended for people who have a body mass index greater than or equal to 35 regardless of obesity-related complication and may be considered for those with a BMI greater than or equal to 30"

 **Possible Reasons** 

* "The deleterious effect of weight loss surgery on bone appears to be caused by various factors, including the massive and rapid weight loss that occurs after surgery, because body weight has a mechanical loading effect on bone and otherwise promotes bone formation. Weight loss results in mechanical unloading and thus a decrease in bone density. Further, when weight loss occurs, there is loss of both muscle and fat mass, and the reduction in muscle mass is deleterious to bone."

* "Other possible causes of bone density reduction include reduced absorption of certain nutrients, such as calcium and **vitamin D**  critical for bone mineralization, and alterations in certain hormones that impact bone health. "
