#### ω-3 PUFA for Secondary Prevention of White Matter Lesions and Neuronal Integrity Breakdown in Older Adults

A Randomized Clinical Trial

JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(8):e2426872. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.26872

Lynne H. Shinto, ND, MPH1; Charles F. Murchison, PhD1,2; Lisa C. Silbert, MD, MCR1,3; et alHiroko H. Dodge, PhD1,4; David Lahna, MS1; William Rooney, PhD5; Jeffrey Kaye, MD1,3; Joseph F. Quinn, MD1,3,6; Gene L. Bowman, ND, MPH1,7

 **Key Points** 

* Question  Does ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment reduce cerebral white matter lesion (WML) accumulation and neuronal integrity breakdown among older adults?

* Findings  In this randomized clinical trial of 102 participants, ω-3 treatment failed to significantly reduce WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants; however, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*E4) carriers who received ω-3 had significant reductions in neuronal integrity breakdown over 3 years.

* Meaning  Although ω-3 treatment failed to reach significant reduction in WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants at risk for dementia, the findings suggest that APOE*E4 carriers may benefit from ω-3 treatment.

* Importance  Older adults with lower intake and tissue levels of long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) have more brain white matter lesions (WMLs), an association suggesting that small-vessel ischemic disease, a major contributor to the development of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, may be preventable through ω-3 treatment.

– – – – – – -

Objective  To determine whether ω-3 treatment reduces WML accumulation in older adults without dementia harboring WMLs and with suboptimal ω-3 status.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with treatment stratification by apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*E4) carrier status used linear mixed-effects models to estimate mean annual change between groups. The study was conducted at Oregon Health & Science University, a major academic medical center in the Pacific Northwest, from May 2014 to final participant visit in September 2019. Data analysis concluded in July 2022. Participants were adults without dementia aged 75 years and older with WMLs greater than or equal to 5 cm3 and plasma ω-3 PUFA less than 5.5 weight percentage of total.

Intervention  Three-year treatment with 1.65 g of ω-3 PUFA (975 mg of EPA and 650 mg of DHA) vs a soybean oil placebo matched for taste, smell, and appearance.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was annual WML progression measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included diffusion tensor imaging of fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA), representing neuronal integrity breakdown.

Results  A total of 102 participants (62 women <span>[60.8%]</span>; mean age, 81 years <span>[range, 75-96 years]</span>) were equally randomized, 51 per treatment group. Although the ω-3 group had less annual WML accumulation than the placebo group, the difference was not statistically significant (1.19 cm3 <span>[95% CI, 0.64-1.74 cm3]</span> vs 1.34 cm3 <span>[95% CI, 0.80-1.88 cm3]</span>; P = .30). Similarly, the ω-3 group had less annual DTI-FA decline than the placebo group, but the difference was not statistically significant (−0.0014 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0027 to 0.0002 mm2/s](95%%20CI,%20−0.0027%20to%200.0002%20mm2/s) vs −0.0027 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0041 to −0.0014 mm2/s](95%%20CI,%20−0.0041%20to%20−0.0014%20mm2/s); P = .07). Among APOE*E4 carriers, the annual DTI-FA decline was significantly lower in the group treated with ω-3 than the placebo group (−0.0016 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0032 to 0.0020 mm2/s](95%%20CI,%20−0.0032%20to%200.0020%20mm2/s) vs −0.0047 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0067 to −0.0025 mm2/s](95%%20CI,%20−0.0067%20to%20−0.0025%20mm2/s); P = .04). Adverse events were similar between treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this 3-year randomized clinical trial, ω-3 treatment was safe and well-tolerated but failed to reach significant reductions in WML accumulation or neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants, which may be attributable to sample size limitations. However, neuronal integrity breakdown was reduced by ω-3 treatment in APOE*E4 carriers, suggesting that this treatment may be beneficial for this specific group.

##### Expect far more success If 1) Reduce Omega-6 intake 2) Use Omega-3 emulsion 3) Add Vitamin D

* Omega-6 blocks the ability of the body to adsorb Omega-3

* Omega-3 emulsions are about 3X more bio-available

   * Very few RCTs do either one as of 2024

!!!!ω-3 PUFA for Secondary Prevention of White Matter Lesions and Neuronal Integrity Breakdown in Older Adults
A Randomized Clinical Trial
JAMA Netw Open. 2024;7(8):e2426872. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.26872

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21515&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;}
__Key Points__
*Question  Does ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment reduce cerebral white matter lesion (WML) accumulation and neuronal integrity breakdown among older adults?
*Findings  In this randomized clinical trial of 102 participants, ω-3 treatment failed to significantly reduce WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants; however, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*E4) carriers who received ω-3 had significant reductions in neuronal integrity breakdown over 3 years.
*Meaning  Although ω-3 treatment failed to reach significant reduction in WML progression and neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants at risk for dementia, the findings suggest that APOE*E4 carriers may benefit from ω-3 treatment.
*Importance  Older adults with lower intake and tissue levels of long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) have more brain white matter lesions (WMLs), an association suggesting that small-vessel ischemic disease, a major contributor to the development of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, may be preventable through ω-3 treatment.

Objective  To determine whether ω-3 treatment reduces WML accumulation in older adults without dementia harboring WMLs and with suboptimal ω-3 status.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This quadruple-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial with treatment stratification by apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE*E4) carrier status used linear mixed-effects models to estimate mean annual change between groups. The study was conducted at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, a major academic medical center in the Pacific Northwest, from May 2014 to final participant visit in September 2019. Data analysis concluded in July 2022. Participants were adults without dementia aged 75 years and older with WMLs greater than or equal to 5 cm3 and plasma ω-3 PUFA less than 5.5 weight percentage of total.

Intervention  Three-year treatment with 1.65 g of ω-3 PUFA (975 mg of EPA and 650 mg of DHA) vs a soybean oil placebo matched for taste, smell, and appearance.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was annual WML progression measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included diffusion tensor imaging of fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA), representing neuronal integrity breakdown.

Results  A total of 102 participants (62 women [60.8%]; mean age, 81 years [range, 75-96 years]) were equally randomized, 51 per treatment group. Although the ω-3 group had less annual WML accumulation than the placebo group, the difference was not statistically significant (1.19 cm3 [95% CI, 0.64-1.74 cm3] vs 1.34 cm3 [95% CI, 0.80-1.88 cm3]; P = .30). Similarly, the ω-3 group had less annual DTI-FA decline than the placebo group, but the difference was not statistically significant (−0.0014 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0027 to 0.0002 mm2/s] vs −0.0027 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0041 to −0.0014 mm2/s]; P = .07). Among APOE*E4 carriers, the annual DTI-FA decline was significantly lower in the group treated with ω-3 than the placebo group (−0.0016 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0032 to 0.0020 mm2/s] vs −0.0047 mm2/s [95% CI, −0.0067 to −0.0025 mm2/s]; P = .04). Adverse events were similar between treatment groups.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this 3-year randomized clinical trial, ω-3 treatment was safe and well-tolerated but failed to reach significant reductions in WML accumulation or neuronal integrity breakdown among all participants, which may be attributable to sample size limitations. However, neuronal integrity breakdown was reduced by ω-3 treatment in APOE*E4 carriers, suggesting that this treatment may be beneficial for this specific group.
