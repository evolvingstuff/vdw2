* In 2013 I could not understand why the study did not find a benefit

*  **Finally, 31 months later ,I found out that they had filtered the subjects, eliminating all of those who were deficient (<10ng?), but failed to mention the filtering in the study nor abstract**

> McAlindon says that a limitation of his clinical trial "is that for ethical reasons,  **we could not enroll people who are medically deficient in D, so none of the participants was really deficient** . Therefore, we couldn't rule out the possibility that people who are extremely deficient in D might experience some benefit from vitamin D."
