Background: Vitamin D deficiency has been  suggested as a cardiovascular risk factor, but little is known about  underlying mechanisms  or associations with inflammatory or hemostatic markers. Our aim was to investigate the association between

25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, a measure  for vitamin D status) concentrations with pre-clinical variations in markers of inflammation and hemostasis.

Methodology/Principal Findings:  Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, C-reactive protein  (CRP), fibrinogen, D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were measured  in a large population  based study of British whites  (aged  45y). Participants  for the  current  investigation  were  restricted  to  individuals free  of drug  treated cardiovascular  disease  (n = 6538). Adjusted  for  sex  and  month,  25(OH)D was  inversely associated   with  all outcomes (p#0.015 for all), but associations with CRP, fibrinogen, and vWF were explained by adiposity. Association with tPA persisted after full adjustment (body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, TV watching, smoking, alcohol consumption, social class, sex, and month), and average concentrations were 18.44% (95% CI 8.13, 28.75) lower for 25(OH)D $75 nmol/l compared  to  ,25 nmol/l. D-dimer concentrations were  lower for participants  with 25(OH)D 50-90nmol/l  compared  to others  (quadratic  term  p = 0.01). We also  examined  seasonal  variation  in  hemostatic and  inflammatory  markers,  and evaluated  25(OH)D contribution  to the  observed  patterns  using mediation  models. TPA concentrations varied by season (p = 0.02), and much of this pattern was related  to fluctuations  in 25(OH)D concentrations (p#0.001). Some evidence  of a seasonal variation was observed  also for fibrinogen, D-dimer and vWF (p,0.05 for all), with 25(OH)D mediating  some of the pattern for fibrinogen and D-dimer, but not vWF.

Conclusions:  Current vitamin D status was associated  with tPA concentrations, and to a lesser degree  with fibrinogen and D-dimer, suggesting that  vitamin D status/intake may be important  for maintaining  antithrombotic homeostasis.
