#### Found lots of opinions and statements but unable to quickly find any good data - Jan 2019

 **Myth or Reality-Transdermal Magnesium? – July 2017** 

 **<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/transdermal-magnesium.pdf">Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a>** 

 **In Feb 2019 I purchased [Oraganix Magnesium Salt Bath Flakes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J9ML9ZB/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 8 lb, $15 Amazon** 

* "Magnesium Chloride is better absorbed than its counterpart Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate)"

* "Dissolve 1-3 cups of the magnesium flakes into a warm footbath or full tub bath, and soak for 30 minutes or longer. 

* ".Temperature of the water should be warm, but not hot. Hot water causes the skin to eliminate rather than absorb"

 **Note: Both baths and IV are not restricted by gut limitations** 

Intravenous (IV) Magnesium 2,000 mg - up to 8,000 mg – much faster than oral 

Apparently MgCl  is preferred over Mg Sulfate

 **Note: DMSO appears to greatly increase transdermal magnesium** 

Again, no data
