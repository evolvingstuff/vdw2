#### Wonder why my balance improved

As I have gotten older I needed to sit down when putting on my pants

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My balance was no longer good enough to stand on one foot for ~10 seconds.

Now, I notice that my balance seems to have been restored - I can now stand one leg for >60 seconds

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I recently increased my winter Vitamin D intake to 100,000 IU of vitamin D every 4 days

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My Vitamin D level is now ~190 ng

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for years I had been taking 50,000 IU every 4 days in the winter and had a level of ~100 ng

About a year ago I added supplements to increase the [Vitamin D getting to tissues](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor)

 **Studies have found that Vitamin D improves balance by:** 

1) [Muscles responding faster when they have higher levels of Vitamin D](/tags/muscles-responding-faster-when-they-have-higher-levels-of-vitamin-d.html)

 **Other Recent Changes** 

Started plant-based Diet - Dec 2019 - which some people say INCREASES dizziness

Started adding Vitamin B12 - Sept 2019 - which various sources on the web say decreases dizziness

Had changed my Omega-3 supplement to a form which is 3X more bio-available (Coromega) this past summer

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting an Omega-3 test today (Mu Omega-3 index was 4.2 a year ago)

 **No Changes in** 

Amount nor type of exercise 

Shoes

Glasses

Hearing (but tinnitus might have decreased)

Drugs (have never taken any for > 2 weeks, and none in the past 2 years)

Please email me &nbsp; hlahore@gmail.com &nbsp; if you have any other possibilities

Thanks

#### The relation between vitamin D and postural balance according to clinical tests and tetrax posturography - 2016

Those with  <20 ng had much worse postural balance than those with >20 ng
