#### Maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy and childhood respiratory and atopic outcomes]  July 2017

 **[published by European Respiratory Society](http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/50/1/1700073)** 

* “After controlling for potential confounders, maternal intake of free sugar was positively associated with atopy (OR for highest versus lowest quintile of sugar intake 1.38, 95% CI 1.06–1.78; per quintile p-trend=0.006) and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23–3.29; per quintile p-trend=0.004). These associations were not confounded by intake of sugar in early childhood, which was unrelated to these outcomes.”

#### Prenatal and Early-Life Fructose, Fructose-Containing Beverages, and Mid-Childhood Asthma - Dec 2017

Annals of the American Thoracic Society https://doi.org/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201707-530OC       PubMed: 29219619

Rationale: Cross-sectional studies have linked intake of high fructose corn syrup sweetened beverages with asthma in school children. 

Objective: To examine associations of maternal prenatal and early childhood intake of sugar sweetened beverages and fructose with current asthma in mid-childhood (median 7.7years). 

Methods: We assessed maternal pregnancy (1st and 2nd trimester average) and child (median 3.3 years) intake of sugar sweetened beverages and total fructose using food frequency questionnaires in 1068 mother-child pairs from Project Viva, a prospective pre-birth cohort. In a multivariable analysis, we examined associations of quartiles of maternal and child sugar sweetened beverage, juice, and total fructose intake with child current asthma in mid-childhood, assessed by questionnaire as ever doctor-diagnosed asthma plus taking asthma medications or reporting wheezing in the past 12 months. 

Results: Higher maternal pregnancy sugar sweetened beverage consumption (mean 0.6 servings/day; range 0-5) was associated with younger maternal age, non-white race/ethnicity, lower education and income, and higher pre-pregnancy BMI. Adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI and other covariates, comparing quartile 4 v. quartile 1, higher maternal pregnancy intake of 

*  **sugar sweetened beverages (OR 1.70** ; 95%CI 1.08, 2.67) and

* total fructose (OR 1.58; 0.98, 2.53) 

were associated with greater odds of mid-childhood current asthma (prevalence=19%). Higher early childhood fructose intake (quartile 4 v. quartile 1) was also associated with mid-childhood current asthma in models adjusted for maternal sugar sweetened beverages (OR 1.79; 1.07, 2.97) and after additional adjustment for mid-childhood BMI z-score (OR 1.77; 1.06, 2.95). 

Conclusion: Higher sugar sweetened beverage and fructose intake during pregnancy and in early childhood may influence childhood asthma development, in part through mechanisms apart from adiposity.
