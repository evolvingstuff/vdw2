#### Sight threatening diabetic retinopathy 1.8 X more likely if vitamin D <20 ng - meta-analysis May 2022

Background

Vitamin D levels have been shown to be associated with diabetic retinopathy, however to date, no review has examined the relationship between vitamin D and sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (STDR) and non-sight threatening diabetic retinopathy (NSTDR). The aim of this review, therefore, was to pool associations between vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and STDR/NSTDR. A further aim was to examine associations between circulating 25(OH)D levels and STDR/NSTDR.

Methods

A systematic review of major databases was undertaken for studies published from inception to 22/04/2022, using a pre-published protocol. Studies reporting prevalence of STDR or NSTDR versus a control group with diabetes and no DR or DME and either (a) vitamin D deficiency prevalence, or (b) circulating 25(OH)D levels, were included. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken.

Results

Following screening, 12 studies (n = 9057) were included in the meta-analysis. STDR was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (OR = 1.80 95%CI 1.40–2.30; p = <0.001), whereas NSTDR was not (OR = 1.07 95%CI 0.90–1.27; p = 0.48). Both conclusions were graded as low credibility of evidence. Furthermore, circulating 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with both NSTDR (SMD = -0.27 95%CI -0.50; −0.04; p = 0.02) and STDR (SMD = −0.49 95%CI -0.90; −0.07; p = 0.02), although these were graded as low credibility of evidence.

Conclusion

Vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with STDR (including DME), but not with NSTDR. Given the well-reported associations between vitamin D deficiency and other unfavourable outcomes, it is important that vitamin D deficiency is managed appropriately and in a timely manner to reduce the risk of blindness in people with diabetes.

#### Growing Crisis—9.6M in America with Diabetic Retinopathy—1.84M at Risk of Blindness—Blacks & Latinos Hit Hardest - June 2023

Dark skins reduces Vitamin D levels in blood

Diabetes reduces VitaminD levels in both blood and cells. 

"Blacks have higher VTDR prevalence rates (8.7%) as well as Hispanics (7.1%) than Whites (3.6%) "

#### Sadly, I convinced a friend with Retinopathy to take vitamin D, but her doctor said >2,000 IU could be toxic

 **I had recommended 4,000 IU = the upper allowable limit at the time.  
She has been blind for the past 8 years** 

 **My recomendation in 2022 would still be an average of 4,000 IU - but taken as 50,000 IU once every 2 weeks along with any of the Vitamin D Receptor activators (daily) listed above**
