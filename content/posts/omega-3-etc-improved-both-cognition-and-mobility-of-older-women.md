Background. Mobility is a key determinant of frailty in older persons, and a variety of dietary factors, such as the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are positively associated with decreased frailty and improved mobility and cognition in older persons.

Methods. The effects of a multinutrient supplement on mobility and cognition were assessed in postmenopausal women (60-84 years). Participants received either  **Efalex Active 50+**  (

* 1 g DHA, 

* 160 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 

* 240 mg Ginkgo biloba, 

* 60 mg phosphatidylserine, 

* 20 mg d-a tocopherol, 

* 1 mg folic acid, and 

* 20 ug vitamin B12 

per day; N = 15) or placebo (N = 12) for 6 months. Mobility was assessed by VICON 9 motion capture camera system synchronized with Kistler force plates, cognitive performance by computerized cognitive function tests, and blood fatty acid levels by pin-prick analysis.

Results. Significant effects of treatment were seen in two of the four cognitive tests, with shorter mean latencies in a motor screening task (p < .05) and more words remembered (p < .03), and one of the three primary mobility measures with improved habitual walking speed (p < .05). Compared with the placebo group, supplementation also resulted in significantly higher blood DHA levels (p < .02).

Conclusions. In this pilot study, multinutrient supplementation improved cognition and mobility in able older females at clinically relevant levels, suggesting a potential role in reducing the decline to frailty.
