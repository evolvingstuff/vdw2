#### Cortisol, Vitamin D, and Vitamin D Receptor

* [Cortisol "Vitamin D Receptor" ](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48&q=%22vitamin+d+receptor%22+cortisol&btnG=) (7,800 Google search results Oct 2023)

* Cortisol uses Cholesterol needed to produce Vitamin D from the sun

Many diseases stress the body ==> consume vitamin D

No indication that mental stress is reduced by Vitamin D (other than [Depression](/categories/depression) )

perhaps stress ==> lower vitamin D ==> depression
