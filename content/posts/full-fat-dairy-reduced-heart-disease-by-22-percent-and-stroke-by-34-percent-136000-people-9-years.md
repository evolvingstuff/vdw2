* “The study, published in Lancet, included 136,384 people in 21 countries followed for an average of nine years.”

* “Total intake of two or more servings of full-fat dairy food was associated with a 22 percent lower risk of heart disease, a 34 percent lower risk of stroke, and a 23 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.”

 **Note: I scanned through the Lancet study several times, but was unable to find a comparison of low-fat diary vs same number of servings of high fat dairy, as was hinted at by the NYT summary.**

==> Increased Cholesterol
