Background and Aim

The evidence regarding the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing severity of COVID-19 is still insufficient. This is partially due to the lack of primary robust trial-based data and heterogenous study designs. This evidence summary, aims to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on morbidity and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Methods

For this study, systematic reviews and meta-analysis published from December 2019 to January 2022 presenting the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 severity were screened and selected from PubMed and Google scholar. After initial screening,  **10 eligible reviews**  were identified and quality of included reviews were assessed using AMSTAR and GRADE tools and overlapping among the primary studies used were also assessed.

Results

The number of primary studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 3-13. Meta-analysis of seven systematic reviews showed strong evidence that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of mortality (Odds ratio: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.346-0.664; p < 0.001) in COVID patients. 

It was also observed that supplementation reduces the need for intensive care ( **Odds ratio: 0.35** ; 95%CI: 0.28-0.44; p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (Odds ratio: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.411-0.708; p < 0.001) requirement. The findings were robust and reliable as level of heterogeneity was considerably low. Qualitative analysis showed that supplements (oral and IV) are well tolerated, safe and effective in COVID patients.

Conclusion

Findings of this study shows that vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing COVID-19 severity. Hence vitamin D should be recommended as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19.
