Background: Vitamin D’s role in COVID-19 management remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, intubation rates, and hospital length of stay (LOS). 

Methods: A systematic review of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases was conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and analytical studies investigating vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients were included. The meta-analysis was performed using STATA MP 18.5, employing random-effect or fixed-effect models based on heterogeneity. 

Results: Twenty-nine studies (twenty-one RCTs, eight analytical) were analyzed. 

Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced ICU admissions (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.79) in RCTs and analytical studies (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.66). Intubation rates were significantly reduced in RCTs (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.92). Mortality reduction was significant in analytical studies (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.86) but not in RCTs (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.61 to 1.04). Subgroup analyses revealed more pronounced effects in older patients and severe COVID-19 cases. LOS showed a non-significant reduction (mean difference = −0.62 days, 95% CI: −1.41 to 0.18). 

Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 patients, particularly in reducing ICU admissions. However, the evidence varies across outcomes and patient subgroups. Discrepancies between RCTs and analytical studies highlight the need for further large-scale, well-designed trials accounting for baseline vitamin D status, standardized supplementation protocols, and patient characteristics to inform clinical guidelines for vitamin D use in COVID-19 management.

Background: The therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aggravation remain controversial and inconclusive. To probe into this contentious issue, we performed the present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods:**  Literature published up to June 2023 **was retrieved from Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase. RCTs assessing mortality, 

* intensive care unit (ICU) admission, 

* mechanical ventilation (MV), 

* length of hospitalization (LOH), and 

* inflammatory markers containing 

   * C-reactive protein (CRP), 

   * D-dimer, 

   * interleukin-6 (IL-6), 

   * lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were included.** 19 RCTs **were involved in the analysis and were conducted subgroup analyses on the baseline COVID-19 severity and vitamin D administration.

Results: In the severity subgroup, statistically significant effects in moderate to severe group were observed in

* ICU admission (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80; p = 0.008), 

* MV (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27, 0.72; p = 0.001) and 

* LOH (SMD –0.49, 95% CI –0.92, −0.06; p = 0.027). 

In the administration subgroup, 

* effects of ICU admission (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16, 0.97; p = 0.044), 

* MV (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07, 0.46; p = 0.000) and 

* LOH (SMD –0.50, 95% CI –0.96, −0.04; p = 0.034) 

were more pronounced in patients supplied with multiple-dose vitamin D than single-dose. Although the result of mortality showed no statistically significant effect, it indicated a reduced trend (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.63, 1.12; p > 0.05). The results of inflammatory markers reached no statistical differences.

Conclusion: This meta-analysis revealed that moderate to severe COVID-19 patients supplied with multiple doses of vitamin D were less apt to need ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and have shorter hospital stays.
