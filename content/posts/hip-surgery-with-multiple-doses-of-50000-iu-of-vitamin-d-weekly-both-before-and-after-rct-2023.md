#### [Effect of Vitamin D Status and Repletion on Postoperative Total Joint Arthroplasty Complications](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04229368) Clinical Trials datatbase

 **Active Comparator: High Vitamin D3 Supplementation** 

Subjects enrolled into Group 2 (high-dose Vitamin D3 supplementation) will receive 50,000 IU of oral Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) twice per week for 1 weeks followed by 50,000 IU once per week for 3 weeks prior to surgery. 

After surgery they will receive 50,000 IU of oral Vitamin D3 once per week for 4 weeks followed by 800 IU daily for 8 weeks. Vitamin D3 supplementation will be given for a total of 4 months.

 **This RCT will probably be successful.** 

 **Even better success predicted if they had** 

1. Use larger repletion dose: 250,000 IU is nice, but 400,000 IU is typical before surgery

1. Repletion dose were proportional to BMI (dose either being more often of larger)
