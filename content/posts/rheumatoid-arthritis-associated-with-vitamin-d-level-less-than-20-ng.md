From the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Georgetown; Howard University; and Washington Hospital Center , Washington, DC; VAMC and University of Colorado, Denver , Colorado; VAMC and University of Utah, Salt Lake, Utah; VAMC and University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, Texas; VAMC and University of Nebraska, Omaha, Nebraska; and VAMC and University of Mississippi, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.

OBJECTIVE: 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH-D) insufficiency/deficiency is increasingly prevalent and has been associated with many chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our purpose was to define the prevalence and associations of 25-OH-D insufficiency/deficiency in a cohort of US veterans with RA.

METHODS: Vitamin D status (25-OH-D) was assessed in patients with RA using radioimmunoassay on banked plasma collected at enrollment. Insufficiency was defined as concentrations < 30 ng/ml and deficiency as < 20 ng/ml. Associations of 25-OH-D insufficiency/deficiency with patient characteristics obtained at enrollment were examined using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, season of enrollment, and race.

RESULTS: Patients (850 men, 76% Caucasian) had a mean (SD) age of 64 (SD 11.3) years. The prevalences of 25-OH-D insufficiency and deficiency were 84% and 43%, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, both insufficiency and deficiency were more common with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positivity and non-Caucasian race, and in the absence of vitamin D supplementation. 25-OH-D deficiency, but not  insufficiency, was  independently associated with  **higher  tender joint counts and highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels** 

CONCLUSION: In a predominantly elderly, male RA population, 25-OH-D  insufficiency was highly prevalent. With the increasing adverse health outcomes associated with hypovitaminosis D, screening and supplementation, particularly among minority, seropositive patients with RA, should be performed routinely.
