 **10,000 IU Vitamin D given 3 times a week, not daily 4,000**

#### Note

1. Larger doses would have been more benefits - even for healthy participants

> Larger doses for those with fatty livers (50% of all seniors)

> Larger doses for those taking drugs which are known to decrease vitamin D levels

> Larger doses for those lacking gallbladders

1. The vitamin D probably did not get to a useful level until 8 weeks into the trial

> They should have started the vitamin D months before the training if not use loading dose

1. Would have found many bigger benefits if used larger dose sizes and started with loading dose

1. Would have had more benefit at 6 months if had continued the vitamin D past 12 weeks

1. Would have had more benefit with a given dose sizes if had

> Taken it with evening meal  (30% increase due to longer time in the gut)

> Added Magnesium (30% increase)

> Used a gut-friendly form for those with digestion problems
