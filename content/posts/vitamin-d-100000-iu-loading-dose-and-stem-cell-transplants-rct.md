#### Loading dose vitamin D3 improves vitamin D insufficiency in adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: A randomized controlled trial

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) patients are well known to be at high risk of vitamin D (vit D) deficiency. This study assessed whether a loading dose (100,000 IU) of vitamin D3 pre-aHSCT could effectively achieve and maintain sufficient post-transplant vit D levels (serum total 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) ≥ 75nmol/L). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was also conducted for bone health evaluation. 74 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, either to the high vit D group (single loading dose (100,000 IU) plus 2,000 IU vit D3 daily) or the control group (2,000 IU vit D3 daily). Vit D levels were measured at three time points (baseline, day 30 and day 100 post-aHSCT). At baseline, fewer than 50% patients had a sufficient 25(OH)D (control: 42.9%; high vit D: 43.6%). The proportion of patients with sufficient 25(OH)D (nmol/L) was increased at day 30 and day 100, with a trend of higher proportion in the high vit D group at day 30 (high vit D vs. control: 89.7% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.08). The increased 25(OH)D was significantly higher in the high vit D group at day 30 (high vit D vs. control: 29±25.2 vs. 14 ±21.9, p = 0.01). Insufficient vit D level before transplant (baseline) was an independent risk factor for vit D insufficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 75nmol/L) post-aHSCT (OR = 4.16, p = 0.03). DXA suggested significant bone loss for total hip in both groups, and in the femoral neck for the control group only. 

In conclusion, single loading dose vitamin D3 significantly increased total 25(OH)D levels at day 30 post-transplant, and the intervention was especially beneficial for patients with baseline vit D insufficiency. We acknowledge that the primary outcome at day 100 post-aHSCT indicating superiority of loading dose versus daily dose supplementation was not met.
