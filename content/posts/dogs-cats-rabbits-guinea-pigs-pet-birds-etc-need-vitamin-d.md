#### Be Aware

 **Be aware - Vets often give vitamin D recommendations as IU per pound of FEED, not per pound of BODY WEIGHT** 

 **Be aware - No consensus as to which animals can get Vitamin D thru their fur/feathers** 

 **Be aware - Many vets are concerned about dogs getting too much Vitamin D.** 

But recall that many doctors had also been concerned about humans getting > 2,000 IU of vitamin D
