#### Is it an activator of the Vitamin D Receptor (spoiler: Yes) - [Perplexity AI Jan 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-vitexin-5TGhGdZqRyWff8tSlSlrnw)

Recent research has revealed that vitexin is indeed a novel VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) agonist. 

Here are the key findings about its interaction with VDR:

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Mechanism of Action</span>** 

 **Direct VDR Targeting** 

Vitexin specifically targets the VDR protein and facilitates its translocation into the cell nucleus 

where it can exert transcriptional activity &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11395219/) &nbsp;[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39272040/)

. **Transcriptional Regulation** 

The compound functions through the VDR/PBLD (phenazine biosynthesis-like domain protein) signaling pathway, regulating transcriptional activation &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11395219/)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Therapeutic Effects</span>** 

 **Anti-Cancer Properties** 

Vitexin's activation of VDR shows particular promise in treating colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). It helps mitigate the progression from chronic colitis to colorectal cancer through:

* Promoting macrophage polarization toward the M1 phenotype

* Modulating the tumor microenvironment

* Activating the VDR/PBLD pathway &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11395219/) &nbsp;[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39272040/)

 **Validation Studies** 

The role of vitexin as a VDR agonist has been confirmed through multiple experimental approaches:

* Co-culture models of macrophages and cancer cells

* ChIP-seq analysis

* Dual luciferase reporter assays

* Mouse models with VDR gene knockout &nbsp;[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11395219/)

These findings establish vitexin as a legitimate VDR agonist with therapeutic potential, particularly in inflammatory and cancer-related conditions.
