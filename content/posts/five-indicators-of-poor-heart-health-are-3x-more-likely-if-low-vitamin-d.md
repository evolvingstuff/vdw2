#### Relationship between Vitamin D Insufficiency, Lipid Profilnd Atherogenic Indices in Healthy Women Aged 18-50 Years

Although vitamin D insufficiency has been correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), there are few data on the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25( OH)D) and atherogenic indices predictive of CVD. This study investigated the relationship of vitamin D status with lipid profile and atherogenic indices in adult women in Morocco. Three hundred women aged 18 to 50 years from Meknes were included. Fasting 25(OH)D and lipid concentrations were assayed by a one-step electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay and an enzymatic method, respectively. Atherogenic indices (atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), atherogenic coefficient (AC), non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C), Castelli risk indices I and II (CRI-I and II), and CHOLIndex (CI)) were calculated using conventional lipid parameters. Logistic regression models and operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to assess the relationship of the variables and estimate the threshold of 25(OH)D levels associated with high atherogenic indices. 25(OH) D below 20 ng/mL was significantly associated with an enhanced risk of hypertriglyceridemia and elevated values of AIP, AC, non-HDL-C, and CRI-I with an OR (95% CI) of 4.904 (1.856-12.959), 3.637 (2.149-6.158), 3.589 (1.673-7.700), 2.074 (1.215-3.540), and 2.481 (1.481-4.123), respectively. According to the ROC analysis, the likelihood of hypertriglyceridemia and high values of AIP, AC, non-HDL-C, and CRI-I were associated with 25(OH)D thresholds ≤15.15 ng/mL, ≤17.5 ng/mL, ≤19.8 ng/mL, ≤20.1 ng/mL, and ≤19.5 ng/mL, respectively, all p < 0.01. Based on the atherogenic indices, this study indicates that vitamin D below 20 ng/mL may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in adult women. Additional health measures are essential to raise awareness among women and health professionals of preventing and controlling cardiovascular risk factors, particularly among young individuals.
