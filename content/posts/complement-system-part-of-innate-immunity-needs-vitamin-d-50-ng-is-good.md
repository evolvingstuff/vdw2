#### Vitamin D deficiency leads to the abnormal activation of the complement system

Immunol Res. 2022 Sep 30. [doi: 10.1007/s12026-022-09324-6](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-022-09324-6)

Vitamin D deficiency can damage the human immune system, and the complement system is a key component of the immune system. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which vitamin D affects the immune system by analyzing the changes in the protein expression of the complement system under different vitamin D levels. We selected 40 participants and divided them into three groups according to their serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD): 

* group A, 25(OH)VD ≥ 40 ng/mL; 

* group B, 30 ng/mL ≤ 25(OH)VD < 40 ng/mL; and 

* group C, 25(OH)VD < 30 ng/mL. 

Serum samples were subjected to biochemical analysis, followed by proteomic analysis using high-throughput untargeted proteomic techniques. Vitamin D deficiency increased the levels of fasting blood sugar, fasting serum insulin, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance and decreased the secretion of HOMA of β-cell function, which led to insulin resistance and glucose metabolism disorder. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency resulted in the abnormal expression of 56 differential proteins, among which the expression levels of complement factor B, complement component C9, inducible co-stimulator ligand, and peptidase inhibitor 16 significantly changed with the decrease in vitamin D content. Functional enrichment analysis of these differential proteins showed that they were mainly concentrated in functions and pathways related to insulin secretion and inflammation. 

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency not only contributes to insulin resistance and glucose metabolism disorder but also causes abnormal protein expression, resulting in the abnormal activation of the complement system. This study provides a novel theoretical basis for further studies on the relationship between vitamin D and the immune system.

In conclusion, the main findings of this study were as follows: 

* (1) vitamin D deficiency caused insulin resistance and glucose metabolism disorder,

* (2) vitamin D deficiency led to the abnormal expression of complement proteins and the activation of the complement system, and 

* (3) functional enrichment analysis revealed that dysregulated complement proteins were involved in cellular functions related to insulin `secretion and glucose metabolism regulation. 

This study provides a novel reference for further studies on the regulatory effect of vitamin D on the immune system.

#### Complement system [Wikipedia Sept 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_system%20)

The complement system, also known as complement cascade, is a part of the immune system that enhances (complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. It is part of the innate immune system,<sup>[1]</sup> which is not adaptable and does not change during an individual's lifetime. 

The complement system can, however, be recruited and brought into action by antibodies generated by the adaptive immune system.
