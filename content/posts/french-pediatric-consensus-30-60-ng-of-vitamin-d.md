#### Vitamin D and calcium intakes in general pédiatrie populations: A French expert consensus paper

Arch Pediatr. 2022 Mar 16;S0929-693X(22)00073-2. [doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2022.02.008.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2022.02.008.)

Objectives: Nutritional vitamin D supplements are often used in general pediatrics. Here, the aim is to address vitamin D supplementation and calcium nutritional intakes in newborns, infants, children, and adolescents to prevent vitamin D deficiency and rickets in general populations.

Study design: We formulated clinical questions relating to the following categories: the Patient (or Population) to whom the recommendation will apply; the Intervention being considered; the Comparison (which may be “no action,” placebo, or an alternative intervention); and the Outcomes affected by the intervention (PICO). These PICO elements were arranged into the questions to be addressed in the literature searches. Each PICO question then formed the basis for a statement. The population covered consisted of children aged between 0 and 18 years and premature babies hospitalized in neonatology. Two groups were assembled: a core working group and a voting panel from different scientific pediatric committees from the French Society of Pediatrics and national scientific societies.

Results: We present here 35 clinical practice points (CPPs) for the use of native vitamin D therapy (ergocalciferol, vitamin D2 and cholecalciferol, vitamin D3) and calcium nutritional intakes in general pediatric populations. 

Conclusion: This consensus document was developed to provide guidance to health care professionals on the use of nutritional vitamin D and dietary modalities to achieve the recommended calcium intakes in general pediatric populations. These CPPs will be revised periodically. Research recommendations to study key vitamin D outcome measures in children are also suggested.

##### Clinical practice points

* 1.	We recommend measuring only serum total 25(OH)D concentration in assessing vitD status in children.

* 2.	We recommend measuring serum total 25(OH)D concentration in the same lab for a given child.

* 3.	We recommend that assays of 1,25(OH)2D or other metabolites should not be used routinely in pediatrics.

* 4.	We do not recommend systematic measurement of serum total 25(OH)D concentration in general pediatric populations.

* 5.	We recommend measurement of serum total 25(OH)D levels when there are symptoms of rickets.

* 6.	We recommend a 25(OH)D level >20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) in general pediatric populations to prevent rickets.

* 7.	We suggest a 25(OH)D level  **>30 ng** /mL (75 nmol/L) in general pediatric populations to avoid any mineralization defects and seasonal variability.

* 8.	We suggest a 25(OH)D level  **<60 ng** /mL (150 nmol/L) in general pediatric populations.

* 9.	Toxicity has been described when 25(OH)D levels are above 80 ng/mL (200 nmol/L) in general pediatric populations.

* 10.	We recommend supplementing healthy children 0-18 years of age with a minimum of 400 1U of vitD per day. <span style="color:#00F;">Level A evidence</span>

* 11.	We recommend supplementing healthy children 0-18 years of age with a maximum of 800 1U of vitD per day. <span style="color:#00F;">Level C evidence</span>

* 12.	We recommend daily supplementation in children 0-2 years using D2 or D3.

* 13.	We suggest preferring daily supplementation in children 2 -18 years using D2 or D3.

* 14.	We suggest intermittent supplementation in the case of nonadherence in children 2-18 years using vitD3 with either 50,000 1U quarterly or 80,000-100,000 1U twice in fall and winter.

* 15.	We recommend avoiding of 200,000 1U of vitD in one shot.

* 16.	We recommend using only licensed pharmaceutical native vitD supplements.

* 17.	We recommend a minimum of 800 1U and a maximum of 1600 1U of vitD per day in children 2-18 years of age in the case of decreased availability of vitD (obesity, black ethnicity, absence of skin exposure to sun) or decreased intake (vegan diet).

* 18.	In such children, we recommend daily supplementation with vitD2 or D3.

* 19.	In such children, we suggest intermittent supplementation in the case of nonadherence using vitD3 with either 50,000 1U every 6 weeks or 80,000-100,000 1U quarterly.

* 20.	We recommend considering at increased risk of developing rickets and vitD deficiency children and teenagers with the following conditions: malabsorption, maldigestion, chronic kidney disease, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis, hepatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis, secondary bone fragility, chronic inflammatory diseases, anorexia nervosa, skin diseases, anticonvulsant medications, or long-term corticosteroids.

* 21.	We suggest that general pediatricians/physicians verify adherence to vitD supplementation in these children.

* 22.	We recommend that physicians rule out the use of over-the-counter vitD preparations before prescribing native vitD supplementation.

* 23.	We suggest monitoring 25(OH)D levels in patients receiving treatment doses above the upper ranges currently recommended.

* 24.	We recommend measuring 25(OH)D levels in the following conditions to adjust vitD supplementation: family history of vitD intoxication, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, kidney stones, and/or nephrocalcinosis.

* 25.	We suggest preferring daily vitD supplementation in these patients.

* 26.	We recommend that, from the age of 1 to 18 years, children and adolescents should consume at least three to four portions of dairy products per day to cover calcium needs.

* 27.	We recommend prescribing 500-1000 mg per day of calcium supplementation in children and adolescents receiving less than 300 mg adjusted for calcium bioavailability of nutritional calcium per day, especially in those following a vegan diet.

> - - - - Nutritional calcium

* 28.	We recommend evaluating dietary calcium intakes in children with fractures and bone pain.

* 29.	Diagnosis of calcium deficiency requires a dietary calcium intake evaluation, radiographs of wrists and knees, and measurement of plasma ALP, PTH, 25(OH)D, calcium and phosphate, and urinary excretion of calcium.

> - - - -PREMATURE

* 30	We recommend optimizing nutritional calcium and phosphate intakes in premature neonates	

* 31	We suggest that, during the initial stay in the NICU, preterm infants receive between 600 IU and 1000 IU per day of vitD, taking into account the content of vitD in milk and parenteral nutrition, vitD supplementation during pregnancy, and birth weight	

* 32	We recommend measurement of 25(OH)D in children born before 32 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 1500 grams at 1 month of age

* 33	We recommend 50 nmol/L as the lower target level and 120 nmol/L as the upper target level of 25 (OH)D in premature neonates

* 34.	After discharge from the NICU, we suggest following recommendations in general pediatric populations.

> - - - - French overseas territories:

* 35.	 We suggest the same pattern of supplementation as in Metropolitan France.

##### VitaminDWiki observations on consensus

* Consensus 9 says levels >80 = toxicity.  Do not recall seeing that in any pediatric or adult studies 

* Consensus 10 and 11  incorrectly recommend the same amount independent of age

   * See green chart below

* Consensus 12, 13, 18 says D2 is OK - but vets declared 10 years ago that no mammal should ever be given D2

* Consensus 14, 19 says quarterly and twice a year supplementation is OK - It is not

* Consensus 147 says up to 1600 IU in special conditions. AMA years ago recommended 1600 IU normally

* Consensus 33 says max 48 ng for preemies but says max 60 ng in #8

* Consensus fails to comment on injections being useful for infrequent supplementation

* Consensus fails to comment on getting vitamin D via breastfeeding

* Consensus fails to comment on gut-friendly forms of vitamin D needed sometimes

* Consensus fails to comment on the use of loading dose to quickly raise vitamin D levels
