International consortium of researchers found 29 new MS gene variants - involved researchers from Mainz

Scientists have identified  **29 new genetic variants associated with disease multiple sclerosis** . Many of the genes that were identified in the study belong to the immune system - so this is crucial in the development of the disease. Today the work of the international research consortium led by the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford in the  **journal Nature** , was published. It is the largest ever genetic study of multiple sclerosis.

More than 250 researchers in 23 research groups from 15 countries - including a group of researchers of the Department of Neurology, University Medical Center - were involved.

Multiple sclerosis is one of the most common diseases of the nervous system in young adults - in Germany alone there are currently more than 120,000 people affected. In the disease, the protective sheath (myelin sheath), with the nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord are encased is damaged, so that excitation signals can not be forwarded. Similarly, the nerve fibers themselves are damaged. The consequences are, depending on which nerves are affected, among other difficulties in walking, numbness and blurred vision. The results published today underscore the central role of the immune system in the destruction of nerve cells and help to understand how exactly looks like the immune attack on brain and spinal cord.

The study examined the scientists who are "Consortium Wellcome Trust Case Control" in the "International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium" and together, the genetic material of 9772 persons with multiple sclerosis and of 17 376 healthy control subjects. 

The international research team was able to  **confirm 23 already known**  genetic associations and to identify  **29 more new genetic variants**  associated with the emergence of multiple sclerosis. Many of these genes play a fundamental role in the work of the immune system, particularly in the function of certain immune cells called T cells, and the activation of certain neurotransmitters, the interleukins. T-cells are a type of white blood cells: they are responsible for mediating an immune response against foreign substances, but also play a role in autoimmune diseases. It is interesting that one third of the newly identified genes are also associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease or type 1 diabetes appears to play a role. This could mean that expire in various autoimmune diseases, the same basic mechanisms, the researchers said.

In addition, previous studies an association between  **vitamin D deficiency**  and an increased risk of multiple sclerosis had suggested. Besides the many identified genes that play a direct role in the immune system, the researchers could also account for two genes involved in the metabolism of  **vitamin D**  are involved. This would be a possible link between genetic and environmental risk factors of multiple sclerosis.

Alastair Compston of Cambridge University said: "Our research ended the long-standing debate about what the first step in the complex development of multiple sclerosis is. It is now clear that multiple sclerosis is primarily an immunological disease, because the associated with the disease characteristics are in the majority immunolgisch relevant genes. "" Our results of the value of large genetic studies highlight the identification of key principles that widespread human diseases underlying "said Peter Donnelly of the" Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, "University of Oxford. "Such studies are not a large international research network - making the data a very large number of patients are available. - Simply not possible"

"After many years of small genetic studies of multiple sclerosis have now succeeded in an international approach, the entire genome - our genetic information - study on risk factors, which are involved in the development of the disease," said the neurologist Professor Frauke Zipp , who led the research team at University Medical Center. "Most of the factors come from our defense system, the immune system. Thus we now know that it is indeed an autoimmune disease and that we must continue working to develop anti-inflammatory therapies. "

Professor Frauke Zipp is a member of Disease-related competence network multiple sclerosis (KKNMS), which supported the study as part of its sponsorship by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. Furthermore, the study by the British "Wellcome Trust" and the German share of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research has been funded.

### Genetic risk and a primary role for cell-mediated immune mechanisms in multiple sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis is a common disease of the central nervous system in which the interplay between inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes typically results in intermittent neurological disturbance followed by progressive accumulation of disability1. Epidemiological studies have shown that genetic factors are primarily responsible for the substantially increased frequency of the disease seen in the relatives of affected individuals2, 3, and systematic attempts to identify linkage in multiplex families have confirmed that variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exerts the greatest individual effect on risk4. Modestly powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS)5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 have enabled more than 20 additional risk loci to be identified and have shown that multiple variants exerting modest individual effects have a key role in disease susceptibility11. Most of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to the disease remains to be defined and is anticipated to require the analysis of sample sizes that are beyond the numbers currently available to individual research groups. In a collaborative GWAS involving 9,772 cases of European descent collected by 23 research groups working in 15 different countries, we have replicated almost all of the previously suggested associations and identified at least a further 29 novel susceptibility loci. Within the MHC we have refined the identity of the HLA-DRB1 risk alleles and confirmed that variation in the HLA-A gene underlies the independent protective effect attributable to the class I region. Immunologically relevant genes are significantly overrepresented among those mapping close to the identified loci and particularly implicate T-helper-cell differentiation in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.
