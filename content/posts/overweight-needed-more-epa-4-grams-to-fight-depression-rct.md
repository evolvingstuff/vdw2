Objective: This study compared the impact of 3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) doses versus placebo on inflammatory biomarkers and depressive symptoms.

Methods: Sixty-one unmedicated adults (75% female; 45.5 ± 13.8 years) with DSM-5 major depressive disorder (MDD), body mass index > 25 kg/m2, and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) ≥ 3.0 mg/L were randomly assigned to receive EPA 1 g/d, 2 g/d, or 4 g/d or placebo for 12 weeks. Prespecified endpoints were a ≥ 0.40 effect size decrease in plasma interleukin (IL)-6, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cytokines, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. Response was defined as a ≥ 50% decrease of Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Clinician-Rated version (IDS-C30) scores. We compared outcomes for the 3 EPA doses versus placebo.

Results: In 45 completers, only median PBMC TNF decreased at 2 g/d EPA. No EPA dose produced a ≥ 0.35 effect size reduction in plasma IL-6 or mitogen-stimulated TNF. Response rates for EPA 4 g/d were 64%, versus 40% for placebo (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span> = 2.63; Cohen d = 0.53), 38% for EPA 1 g/d, and 36% for EPA 2 g/d (all P > .05). EPA 4 g/d showed a significant correlation between percent decrease in plasma hs-CRP and IDS-C30 symptom reduction at 12 weeks (Spearman ρ = 0.691, P = .019).

Conclusions: EPA 4 g/d demonstrated a medium effect size for response rates versus placebo. This dose may alleviate MDD in overweight individuals with elevated inflammatory markers, and change in hs-CRP may be correlated with clinical response.
