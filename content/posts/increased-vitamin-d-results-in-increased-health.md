 **Other notes** 

ALL life on earth, for the past 750 million years, has needed Vitamin D

this need for vitamin D proceeded the development of skeletons

There are vitamin D receptors in virtually every cell of your body

Vitamin D modulates over 10% of all known genes in  the human body

Starting about 100 years ago vitamin D levels have been  dropping

Vitamin D levels seemed to have dropped by 50% in just the past 20 years

These decreased levels MAY be a reason for the increase in many health problems during the past few decades
