#### Self-reported prescribing behaviour of vitamin D prophylaxis in healthy children by Belgian paediatricians

Eur J Clin Nutr. 2024 Jan 3. [doi: 10.1038/s41430-023-01387-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-023-01387-4)

There is currently no consensus on the guidelines for vitamin D prophylaxis in healthy children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prescribing behaviour of vitamin D prophylaxis among Belgian paediatricians. Between June and September 2022, a questionnaire was distributed by email to all Belgian paediatricians who are a member of at least one of three scientific or professional organisations, as well as to the heads of every Belgian paediatric or neonatal hospital ward. We analysed 426 completed questionnaires. All regions, age categories and subspecialties were represented. 

 **Vitamin D prophylaxis is always or frequently recommended by 98% of paediatricians.** 

Fifty-eight per cent of paediatricians advise vitamin D prophylaxis up to the age of six years and 66% of paediatricians advise a daily dose of 400 IU. 

In nearly every hospital in Belgium (96%), there is a specific protocol for vitamin D prophylaxis for newborns; but not for the paediatric unit (only 30%). 

Nearly all Belgian paediatricians prescribe vitamin D prophylaxis to infants. Although not recommended by guidelines, 25(OH)D is frequently measured by paediatricians. Practices regarding duration and dosing of vitamin D prophylaxis show large variability. Most neonatal wards do have a protocol, whereas most paediatric wards do not.
