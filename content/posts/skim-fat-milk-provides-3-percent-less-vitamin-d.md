#### Higher milk fat content is associated with higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in early childhood.

Bought the PDF.  The science seems OK

Many (but not all) studies have found that you need to take Vitamin D with a fatty meal

If true, this might account for [association between obesity and drinking skim milk](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2356806/Could-SKIMMED-MILK-contributing-obesity-epidemic-Low-fat-dairy-encourage-weight-gain-say-experts.html)

Wonder if it is because [skim milk has more sugar](http://www.drfranklipman.com/5-reasons-to-skip-the-skim-milk/) 

Wonder how many studies have failed to consider differences between skim and whole milk

Note: Vitamin D which is water soluble/dispersible can fortify any kind of milk, juice, water, etc.

For example: 10,000 IU of vitamin D powder added to a gallon would add 625 IU per cup 

Study also states:  **2X more likely to be vitamin D deficient if drink 1% milk** 

 **Wonder how much more  of a decline (3x?) if drink non-fat milk**

#### Hypothesis: decreased bioavailable Calcium if decreased Vitamin D (low-fat milk)

Note: Most studies assume that the amount of Calcium adsorbed is independent of the fat content of the milk

However

Current guidelines for cow's milk consumption in children older than age 2 years suggest 1% or 2% milk to reduce the risk of obesity. Given that milk is the main dietary source of vitamin D for North American children and that vitamin D is fat soluble, we hypothesized 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration to be positively associated with the fat content of milk. The objective was to determine the relationship between the fat content of milk consumed and the serum 25(OH)D concentration; our secondary objective was to explore the role that the volume of milk consumed played in this relationship. We completed a cross-sectional study of children aged 12-72 months in the TARGetKids! research network. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between milk fat content and child 25(OH)D, adjusted for clinically relevant covariates. The interaction between volume of milk and fat content was examined. Two thousand eight hundred fifty-seven children were included in the analysis. 

The fat content of milk was positively associated with 25(OH)D (p = 0.03), and the interaction between the volume of milk consumed and the milk fat content was statistically significant (p = 0.005). 

 **Children who drank 1% milk needed 2.46**  cups (95% confidence interval (CI)  **2.38-2.54** ) of milk to have a 25(OH)D concentration similar to that of children who drank 1 cup of homogenized milk (3.25% fat). 

Children who consumed 1% milk had 2.05 (95% CI 1.73-2.42) times higher odds of having a 25(OH)D concentration <50 nmol/L compared with children who consumed homogenized milk. In conclusion, recommendations for children to drink lower-fat milk (1% or 2%) may compromise serum 25(OH)D levels and may require study to ensure optimal childhood health.
