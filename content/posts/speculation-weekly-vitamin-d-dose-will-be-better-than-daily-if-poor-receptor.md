 **Unaware of any trials which support this speculation as of Sept 2017** 

 **| | |
| --- | --- |
| Fact | Vitamin D Receptors restrict how much activated blood vitamin D actually gets to cells |
| Observation | ((Omega-3 weekly is more bio-available than daily (rat study) â€“ July 2015 | Omega-3 given to rats weekly resulted in more Omega-3 in blood than when given daily)) |
| Observation  | Increasing a daily dose of vitamin D((Vitamin D Receptor | increases the cellular vitamin D even if poor vitamin D receptor)). Receptor limits, but does not entirely block |
| <span style="color:green;">Speculation</span> | <span style="color:green;">Giving weekly dose should further increase the cellular vitamin D (nonlinear)</span> |** 

#### Graphical summary of speculation: blood level activated vitamin D ==> cell level
