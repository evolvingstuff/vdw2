Background: Several studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation could be useful for treating diffuse musculoskeletal (DMS) pain in adults. 

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of correcting a vitamin D deficiency (≤ 50 nmol/l) on DMS pain and quality of life in adults. 

Methods: A pragmatic prospective study was conducted in a general practice setting in the Rhone-Alps area between 1 February and 30 April 2009. Patients between the  **ages of 18 and 50 years old**  who consulted their general practitioner (GP) for DMS pain or chronic unexplained asthenia and had a deficient serum 25 (OH) D level with no signs of any other disease were enrolled in this study. The patients received high doses of vitamin D supplements ( **400 000 to 600 000 units** ). Mean pain evaluation scores were evaluated before and after vitamin D supplementation using mixed models and accounting for repeated measures. 

Results: Before vitamin D supplementation, the adult study cohort (n = 49) had an adjusted mean serum 25 (OH) D level of 23.7 nmol/l, a mean pain evaluation score of 5.07 and a mean quality of life score of 3.55. After vitamin D supplementation, the adjusted mean serum 25 (OH) D level increased to 118.8 nmol/l (P < 0.001), the mean quality of life score increased to 2.8 nmol/l (P < 0.001) and the mean pain evaluation score decreased to 2.8 (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In this small before-and-after study, vitamin D supplementation decreased pain scores in adult patients with diffuse musculoskeletal pain and vitamin D deficiency. These results must be confirmed by further studies.

[Previously published in French](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23332894) April 2013, which has the following conclusion

The correction of vitamin D deficiency resulted in a significant decrease in the level of pain intensity according to 

* verbal rating scale (P=0.034) and the 

* Digital Scale (P<0.001), 

* consumption of analgesics (P=0.002) and 

* discomfort in carrying out activities of daily living following: the shopping, cleaning, 

* walking for more than a kilometer (P<0.001) and 

* dressing (P=0.012)
