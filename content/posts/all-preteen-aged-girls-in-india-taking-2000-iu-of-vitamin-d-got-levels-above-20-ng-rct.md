Objective: To compare the adequacy and efficacy of different doses of vitamin D3 in pre-pubertal girls.

Design: Cluster Randomized controlled trial.

Setting: Public school in Delhi, India, between August 2015 and February 2016.

Participants: 216 healthy pre-pubertal girls, aged 6.1-11.8 years.

Intervention: Daily supplementation with 600 IU (n=74), 1000 IU (n=67) or 2000 IU (n=75) of vitamin D3 under supervision for 6 months.

Outcome measures: Primary: Rise in serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D); Secondary: Change in bone formation and resorption markers.

Results

Following 6 months of supplementation, the mean (SD) rise in serum 25(OH)D was maximum with 2000 IU (24.09 (8.28) ng/mL), followed by with 1000 IU (17.96 (6.55) ng/mL) and 600 IU (15.48 (7.00) ng/mL). Serum 25(OH)D levels of ≥20 ng/mL were seen in 91% in 600 IU group, 97% in 1000 IU group and  **100% in 2000 IU group** . The overall mean (SD) rise in urinary calcium creatinine ratio (0.05 (0.28) to 0.13 (0.12) mg/mg), and serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (538.9 (199.78) to 655.5 (218.24) ng/mL), and reduction in serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide (0.745 (0.23) to 0.382 (0.23) ng/mL) was significant (P<0.01). The change in the above parameters was comparable among the three groups after adjustment for age.

Conclusion: Daily vitamin D supplementation with 600 IU to 2000 IU for 6 months results in Vitamin D sufficiency in >90% of prepubertal girls.

#### Most deficient schoolchildren got > 20 ng with 2,000 IU daily - RCT March 2019

Impact of three different daily doses of vitamin D3 supplementation in healthy schoolchildren and adolescents from North India: a single-blind prospective randomised clinical trial.

Br J Nutr. 2019 Mar;121(5):538-548. [doi: 10.1017/S0007114518003690.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114518003690.)

In India, there is a lack of information about the adequate daily dose of vitamin D3 supplementation in school children. Hence, we undertook this study to evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of different doses of vitamin D3 in schoolchildren. A total of 1008 vitamin D-deficient (VDD) children,  **aged 6-16 years**  with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels &lt;50nmol/l, were cluster randomised into three groups (A-344, B-341 and C-232) for supplementation (600, 1000 and 2000 IU daily) of vitamin D3 under supervision for 6 months. Of the 1008 subjects who completed the study, 938 (93 %) were compliant. Baseline and post-supplementation fasting blood and urine samples were evaluated for Ca, phosphates, alkaline phosphatase, 25(OH)D and parathormone and urine Ca:creatinine ratio. The mean age of the subjects was 11·7 (sd 2·4) years, and the overall mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 24·3 (SD 9·5)nmol/l. Post-supplementation rise in serum 25(OH)D in compliant group was maximum with 2000 IU (70·0 (SD 30·0)nmol/l), followed by 1000 IU (46·8 (SD 22·5)nmol/l) and 600 IU (36·5 (SD 18·5)nmol/l), and serum 25(OH)D levels of ≥50nmol/l were achieved in 71·5, 81·8 and 92·9 % by groups A, B and C, respectively. Secondary hyperparathyroidism decreased from 31·7 to 8·4 % post-supplementation. Two participants developed hypercalciuria, but none developed hypercalcaemia. Children with VDD benefit maximum with the daily supplementation of 2000 IU of vitamin D3. Whether recommendations of 400 IU/d by Indian Council of Medical Research or 600 IU by Indian Academy of Pediatrics or Institute of Medicine would suffice to achieve vitamin D sufficiency in children with VDD remains debatable.
