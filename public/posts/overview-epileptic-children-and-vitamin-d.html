This study aims to assess serum vitamin D3 levels in people with epilepsy and evaluate the effects of supplementation on their QoL.</p><p>Methods A prospective study was conducted at a tertiary hospital from June 2021 to July 2022. People with epilepsy aged 12 to 45 years, receiving antiseizure medications for at least 1 year, were recruited. Baseline serum vitamin D3 levels were measured, and epilepsy diagnoses were confirmed according to the International League Against Epilepsy guidelines (2017). QoL was evaluated using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Scale (QOLIE-31) for adults and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy for Adolescents Scale (QOLIE-48) for adolescents. Patients with vitamin D3 deficiencies received supplementation, and their QoL were reassessed at 3 and 6 months. Data were analyzed using t-tests, multiple logistic regression, and analysis of variance.</p><p>Results At baseline, the mean serum vitamin D3 level was 17.99 ± 6.77 ng/mL, increasing to 21.46 ± 2.91 ng/mL at 3 months and 24.41 ± 3.19 ng/mL at 6 months. Patients with vitamin D3 deficiency exhibited significantly lower scores across multiple domains of the Quality of Life Inventory (QOLIE-31 and QOLIE-48). A significant improvement was seen in most of the QOLIE scores and serum vitamin D3 levels after vitamin D3 supplementation.</p><p>Conclusion People with epilepsy on long-term antiseizure medications have vitamin D3 deficiency, which negatively impacts their QoL. Regular screening and supplementation are recommended for better management of epilepsy.</p><p><strong>Dosing information from PDF</strong></p><p>A two-phase supplementation regimen was used: an intensive phase of <strong>60,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks</strong> ,</p><p>followed by a maintenance phase of <strong>600 to 1,000 IU daily for adolescents</strong></p><p>and <strong>1,500 to 2,000 IU daily for adults.</strong></p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/epilepsie-table.webp>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=epileptics-would-have-had-an-even-better-response-if-a-gut-friendly-vitamin-d-had-been-used>Epileptics would have had an even better response if a gut-friendly Vitamin D had been used</h5><p>Functional gastrointestinal disorders occur in 62.5% of epilepsy patients versus 39.8% in healthy individuals</p><p><strong><a href=/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Gut-Friendly Vitamin D">Gut-Friendly Vitamin D</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=probiotics-should-also-augment-any-form-of-vitamin-d-for-those-with-gut-problems>Probiotics should also augment any form of vitamin D for those with gut-problems</h5><p>[</p><p>Perplexity AI Jan 2025](<a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/do-epileptics-have-poor-guts-nj.RahG9T.uPlIbLPs4ANQ>https://www.perplexity.ai/search/do-epileptics-have-poor-guts-nj.RahG9T.uPlIbLPs4ANQ</a>)</p><p>&ldquo;28.9% of drug-resistant epilepsy patients showed >50% reduction in seizures with probiotic treatment&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=epilepsy-seizures-reduced-by-daily-1000-iu-of-vitamin-d-added-to-monotherapy----rct-sept-2024>Epilepsy seizures reduced by daily 1,000 IU of Vitamin D (added to monotherapy) - RCT Sept 2024</h4><p>Vitamin D Supplementation for Children with Epilepsy on Antiseizure Medications: A Randomized Controlled Trial</p><p>Children 2024, 11(10), 1187; <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/children11101187>https://doi.org/10.3390/children11101187</a></p><p>by Fahad A.

Al-Sulimani 3,Doua Al Homyani 3,Dimah Al</p><p>Background: Antiseizure medications (ASMs) are crucial for managing epilepsy in children. However, a well-documented side effect of ASMs is their impact on bone health, often due to interference with vitamin D metabolism. This can lead to vitamin D deficiency in children with epilepsy. This study aimed to determine if a daily dose of 400 IU or 1000 IU would maintain adequate vitamin D levels in children with epilepsy.</p><p>Methods: A phase IV randomized controlled trial enrolled children aged 2–16 years with epilepsy and receiving antiseizure medications. Children were divided into two groups: the monotherapy group, which was defined as children on one antiseizure medication (ASM), and the polytherapy group, which was defined as children receiving two or more ASMs. Eligible children with levels above 75 nmol/L were randomized to receive a maintenance dose of either 400 IU/day or 1000 IU/day of cholecalciferol. Baseline and 6-month assessments included demographic data, anthropometric measurements, seizure type, medications, seizure control, and 25(OH)D level.</p><p>Results: Out of 163 children, 90 were on monotherapy and 25 on polytherapy. After 6 months of vitamin D maintenance, the proportion of children with 25(OH)D concentration below 75 nmol/L was 75.0% in the 400 IU group and 54.8% in the 1000 IU group. In the monotherapy group, baseline seizure-free children increased from 69% to 83.6% after treating vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>Conclusion: Daily vitamin D supplementation with 1000 IU may be beneficial for children with epilepsy, particularly those receiving monotherapy, to maintain sufficiency and potentially improve seizure control.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/seizures-rct-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=poor-vitamin-d-genes-can-result-in-juvenile-absence-epilepsy---may-2023>Poor vitamin D genes can result in juvenile absence epilepsy - May 2023</h4><p><strong>The causal effect of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels on epilepsy: A two-sample <span style=color:#00f>Mendelian randomization study</span></strong></p><p>Epilepsia Open . 2023 May 9. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/epi4.12758>doi: 10.1002/epi4.12758</a> PDF is behind a paywall</p><p>Xinxin Luo, Zhichao Ruan 1, Ling Liu 2</p><p>Objective: Observational studies have shown an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and epilepsy, but it is unclear whether the association is causal. Therefore, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine the causal relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and epilepsy.</p><p>Methods: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study to investigate the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and epilepsy using pooled statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Data for 25(OH)D came from a GWAS comprising 417,580 participants, and data for epilepsy were obtained from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) consortium. Five methods were used to analyze TSMR, including the inverse variance weighting method, MR Egger method, weighted median method, simple model, and weighted model. In the sensitivity analysis, MR Egger and MR PRESSO methods were used to test for pleiotropy, inverse variance weighting and MR Egger in Cochran&rsquo;s Q statistics were used to test for heterogeneity.</p><p>Results: MR analyzed the relationship between 25(OH)D and different types of epilepsy, and the results showed that a 1 standard deviation increase in natural log-transformed serum 25(OH)D levels was associated with reduced risk for juvenile absence epilepsy (IVW OR = 0.985; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.971-0.999; P-value = 0.038). There was no apparent heterogeneity and horizontal gene pleiotropy.</p><p>Significance: Higher serum levels of 25(OH)D were a protective factor for adolescent absence epilepsy, but had no effect on other types of epilepsy.</p><hr><p>From the web: " <strong>Juvenile absence epilepsy</strong> (JAE) is a type of epilepsy that causes absence (“ab-SONCE”) seizures. During a seizure, the child will stare and stop what they are doing. They may blink quickly or move their hands. They may look like they are daydreaming or not paying attention. These seizures last only a few seconds."</p><p>JAE accounts for 1 to 2% of childhood epilepsies.</p><hr><h4 id=preeclampsia-increases-the-risk-of-epilepsy-by-53x---jan-2025>Preeclampsia increases the risk of epilepsy by 5.3X - Jan 2025</h4><p><strong><a href="https://www.mdedge.com/obgyn/article/272102/epilepsy-seizures/gestational-eclampsia-linked-fivefold-epilepsy-risk?ecd=WNL_EVE_250108_mdedge&amp;uac=138704MX&amp;sso=true">MD Edge</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=antiseizure-medications-reduce-vitamin-d-genes-need-new-guidelines--feb-2023>Antiseizure Medications reduce vitamin D genes, need new guidelines – Feb 2023</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Supplementation in Children on Antiseizure Medications: High Time to Have Proper Guidelines</strong></p><p>Indian Journal of Pediatrics</p><p>Kaushik Ragunathan & Biswaroop Chakrabarty</p><p>A recent meta-analysis highlighted significantly reduced serum vitamin D levels in epileptic children receiving valproate monotherapy compared to healthy controls. Although it is not a conventional hepatic enzyme inducer, there are reports of valproate inducing <strong>CYP3A4 and CYP24A1</strong> , both involved in vitamin D catabolism <sup>[1]</sup>. Valproate activates pregnane X receptor which regulates the expression of vitamin D responsive genes <sup>[2]</sup>. Apart from its importance in bone growth and development, vitamin D also plays a significant role in the functioning of muscular, immune, and cardiovascular systems <sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>Studies by Viraraghavan et al. and Mikati et al. have shown the utility of vitamin D supplementation in children on antiseizure medications (ASMs) <sup>[3, 4]</sup>. The present study by Mishra et al. is a welcome addition in that direction, evaluating the utility of vitamin D supplementation in children on valproate monotherapy <sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Mishra et al. studied children aged 2–12 y with new onset epilepsy on valproate monotherapy with vitamin D–sufficient status at baseline. They were randomized into 2 arms: intervention arm receiving vitamin D (600 IU/d) for a period of 90 d and a control group receiving only ASM. The median vitamin D level significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the intervention and control arms over 3 mo <sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>Mikati et al. and Viraraghavan et al. included cases of a variety of ASMs as mono- or polytherapy. Although Viraraghavan included new-onset epilepsy cases, subjects in the study by Mikati et al. were on ASM for at least 6 mo. Viraraghavan et al. prescribed 60,000 IU/mo of vitamin D in the intervention arm, whereas Mikati et al. had two arms, one receiving 400 IU/d and another receiving 2000 IU/d of vitamin D. Contrary to the study by Mishra et al., both of these studies included cases of vitamin D deficiency at baseline <sup>[3, 4]</sup>. Viraraghavan et al. demonstrated maintained serum vitamin D levels at 6-mo follow-up in the intervention arm compared to a significant decrease in the control arm <sup>[3]</sup>. Mikati et al. found a significant increase in both intervention groups at 1-y follow-up; however, the values were comparable in both groups. They also documented increases in bone mineral density at multiple skeletal sites in both arms <sup>[4]</sup>.

Multiple studies have shown that adult epilepsy patients can exhibit vitamin D deficiency. However, there are few reports investigating pediatric epilepsy patients. In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors related to hypovitaminosis D in pediatric epilepsy patients in Thailand.</p><p>Methods</p><p>A cross-sectional retrospective cohort study was conducted in 138 pediatric epilepsy patients who received anticonvulsants from April 2018 to January 2019. Demographic data, seizure types, puberty status, physical activity, duration, and types of anti-seizure medications were analyzed. Patients with abnormal liver function, abnormal renal function, and who received vitamin D supplements or ketogenic diet containing vitamin D were excluded. Levels of serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured.</p><p>Results</p><p>All 138 subjects were enrolled, the age ranged from 1.04 – 19.96 years; (mean = 9.65 ± 5.09), the mean serum 25(OH) D level was 26.56 ± 9.67 ng/ml. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 23.2% and insufficiency was 47.8% respectively. Two risk factors— <strong>puberty status (OR 5.43</strong> , 95% CI 1.879-15.67) and non-enzyme-inhibiting ASMs therapy (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.117-11.46)—were significantly associated with hypovitaminosis D, as shown by multivariate analyses.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Our study reports the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pediatric epilepsy patients in Thailand despite being located in the tropical zone. These findings can guide clinicians to measure vitamin D status in pediatric epilepsy patients particularly when they reach puberty and/or are using non-enzyme-inhibiting ASMs therapy. Early detection of vitamin D status and prompt vitamin D supplementation can prevent fractures and osteoporosis later in life.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/epilspsy-premature.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=seizures-associated-with-low-vitamin-d---june-2021>Seizures associated with low vitamin D - June 2021</h4><p>Micronutrient characteristics in recurrent seizure in medicine controlled epileptic children with normal nutritional status</p><p>Acta Neurol Taiwan . 2021 Jun;30(2):54-62.</p><p>Irwanto Idris 1, Chasan Ismail 1, Muhammad Riski Darmawan Moestakim 1</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/seizures-2021.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/seizure.jpg alt=image width=800><p>Background: Recurrent seizure in epileptic children is correlated with future motoric disorders, behavior problems, and intellectual disabilities. Various factors are thought to modulate the risk of recurrent seizure, including micronutrient status such as calcium, 25-dehydroxycholecalciferol (25-(OH)D), and serum iron presented as hemoglobin level.</p><p>Aim: To analyze correlation between micronutrient characteristics of epileptic children and recurrence of seizure.</p><p>Methods: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted in the pediatric clinic of Dr. Soetomo hospital from September to October 2019. Epileptic children with long-term anti-epileptic drugs (AED) for over 6 months and ages ranging 2-18 years were included. Recurrent and non-recurrent group were compared. Age, family history of seizure, and duration of AED administration were noted. Peripheral serum level of hemoglobin, calcium, and 25-(OH)D was measured. The median 25-(OH) D level of both groups were corelated with recurrent seizure by using Spearman test (95% confidence interval).</p><p>Results: Thirty children were enrolled. Recurrent seizure was occurred in 19 children. There was significant correlation on hemoglobin and calcium, and 25-(OH)D level with the recurrence of seizure (p less then 0.05).

Giallonardo1, Carola Severi8 and Carlo Di Bonaventura1*</p><p>Introduction: The complex relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) and epilepsy has been increasingly investigated in preclinical studies. Conversely, evidence from clinical studies is still scarce. In recent years, the pivotal role of MGBA dysregulation in the pathophysiology of <strong>functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID)</strong> has been recognized. With this background, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of FGID in patients with epilepsy (PWE) and the possible impact of bowel movement abnormalities on seizure recurrence.</p><p>Methods: A total of 120 PWE and 113 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy subjects (HS) were consecutively enrolled. A questionnaire to evaluate the presence of FGID (according to Rome III diagnostic criteria) was administered to all participants. In a subgroup of drug-resistant patients, we administered an ad-hoc questionnaire combining Bristol stool charts and seizure diaries to evaluate seizure trends and bowel movement changes.</p><p>Results: A higher prevalence of <strong>FGID in PWE (62.5%) than in HS (39.8%)</strong> was found (p &lt; 0.001). The most frequently observed disorder was constipation, which was significantly higher in PWE than in HS (43.3 vs. 21.2%, p &lt; 0.001), and was not associated with anti-seizure medication intake according to multivariable analysis. In drug-resistant patients, most seizures occurred during periods of altered bowel movements, especially constipation. A significant weak negative correlation between the number of days with seizures and the number of days with normal bowel movements was observed (p = 0.04). According to multivariable logistic regression analysis, FGID was significantly associated with temporal lobe epilepsy as compared with other lobar localization (p = 0.03).</p><p>Conclusions: Our clinical findings shed new light on the complex relationship between epilepsy and the MGBA, suggesting a bidirectional link between bowel movement abnormalities and seizure occurrence. However, larger studies are required to better address this important topic.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/epilepsy-gut.pdf>Download the PDF from sci-hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=review-of-epilepsy-trials-with-supplements--nov-2020>Review of Epilepsy trials with supplements- Nov 2020</h4><p>. 2020 Oct 29;S0261-5614(20)30591-4. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.10.045>doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2020.10.045</a></p><p><strong>Clinical trials of vitamin-mineral supplementations in people with epilepsy: A systematic review</strong></p><p>Ali A Asadi-Pooya 1, Leila Simani 2</p><p>Objective: The purpose of the current study was to systematically review the literature on the clinical trials of vitamin-mineral supplementations in people with epilepsy (PWE) to treat their seizures.</p><p>Methods: MEDLINE and Scopus from inception to August 25, 2020 were searched for related published manuscripts.

There was one study on zinc and one on selenium. There is some evidence on the efficacy of polyunsaturated fats in treating seizures in PWE. The evidence on the efficacy of multivitamin cocktails in adults is promising.</p><p>Conclusion: High quality data on the efficacy of nutritional (vitamins-minerals) supplementations in treating seizures in PWE is scarce; however, designing future clinical trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for drug-resistant seizures in adults with focal epilepsy and in children, and also multivitamin supplementations in adults with focal epilepsy seems reasonable and promising.

China.</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>The impact of antiepileptics on serum vitamin levels is controversial and uncertain. With no clear conclusions on the impact of antiepileptics on serum levels of vitamins, there is a need for further clinical studies in order to ascertain the impact of old and newer antiepileptic drugs on serum levels of vitamins in epileptic patients, thus accomplishing a suitable usage of vitamins supplementation.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>The intention of the present research is to confirm the hypothesis of whether or not vitamin levels are altered with antiepileptic drugs. The study also aims to reveal which vitamin levels are particularly more altered, are vitamin levels affected by gender and the type and number of antiepileptics used.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>The present research was piloted in collaboration with the Department of Neurology in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University. A total of 63 serum samples of epileptic patients receiving antiepileptics as monotherapy or polytherapy were requested for analysis of nine vitamin serum levels. Total nine vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B9, B12, A, C, D and E) in epileptic patients receiving antiepileptic drugs were analyzed. The serum results of all vitamins were compiled and evaluated with SPSS.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p><strong>It was alarmingly found that serum levels of vitamin D were particularly very low in almost all (90%) epileptic patients in this study. Notably, serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin B1 were also below reference range in 72% and 46% epileptic patients, respectively</strong> . The remaining vitamins were almost in reference range for most of the patients. In our study, mean and frequency of vitamin D, C and B1 levels do not vary too much among different gender groups. The patients receiving newer antiepileptic drugs displayed a slightly increased serum vitamin D levels in comparison to the patients receiving older antiepileptic drugs. We found low vitamin D, C and B1 serum levels in patients who were on monotherapy as in comparison with patients on polytherapy.</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>The most significant and surprising finding of this study revealed that serum vitamin D levels in particular were very low in almost all patients and in some patients vitamin B1 serum levels were also below the reference range. More importantly, it is first time reported here that vitamin C serum levels were also below reference range in the majority of these Chinese epileptic patients. It is recommended that all these vitamins should be regularly monitored in addition to therapeutic drug monitoring of antiepileptic drugs. Additional clinical trials are required for further evaluation. It is also recommended that epileptic patients with low serum levels of these vitamins may be prescribed vitamins supplementations with antiepileptic drugs in order to control their seizures more effectively and efficiently.</p><hr><h4 id=many-antiepileptic-drugs-decrease-vitamin-d---feb-2017>Many Antiepileptic drugs decrease Vitamin D - Feb 2017</h4><ul><li><p><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988507>Epilepsy and vitamin D: a comprehensive review of current knowledge</a> Feb 2017</p><ul><li>Seems like a comprehensive study, <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/epilepsy-sci-hub-2017.pdf>PDF from sci-hub</a></li></ul></li></ul><blockquote><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/antiepileptic-drug.jpg alt=image width=600></blockquote><hr><h4 id=antiepileptic-drugs-reduce-vitamin-d-levels---2016>Antiepileptic drugs reduce vitamin D levels - 2016</h4><p><strong>Effect of Antiepileptic Therapy on Serum 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 Levels in Epileptic Children</strong></p><p>Ann Nutr Metab. 2016;68(2):119-27. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1159/000443535.>doi: 10.1159/000443535.</a> Epub 2016 Jan 27.</p><p>He X1, Jiang P, Zhu W, Xue Y, Li H, Dang R, Cai H, Tang M, Zhang L, Wu Y.</p><p>Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China.</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is not only associated with the adverse effects of chronic treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), but also with epilepsy.

Very little clinical data exists to support the treatment of human epilepsy with Vitamin D, but positive findings from preliminary clinical trials warrant larger Phase I and II clinical trials in order to more rigorously determine the potential therapeutic value of Vitamin D as a treatment for human epilepsy.</p><p><strong>From the end of the conclusion section</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Recently, our group has received an IND for a Phase I study of Vitamin D3 in drug-resistant epilepsy to study the safety, preliminary efficacy and potential cardiac benefits of Vitamin D3 5000 IU/day in drug-resistant epilepsy.&rdquo;</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/epilepsy---2016.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p>**[37 citations of study as of Jan 2025_</p><p><em>](<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10460289673450969790&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10460289673450969790&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en</a>)</em>* Safety and tolerability of Vitamin D3 5,000 IU/day in epilepsy <strong>- May 2019 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.03.001>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.03.001</a> by DeGiorgio  </strong> <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/eplepsy-5-000.pdf>PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a> *** &ldquo;The median percent change in seizure frequency was − 26.9% at six weeks,&rdquo;</p><hr><h4 id=epilepsy-associated-with-low-vitamin-d-even-before-drug-therapy-started---oct-2015-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children-with-newly-diagnosed-idiopathic-epilepsy-j-child-neurol-october-2015-vol-30-no-11-1428-1432>Epilepsy associated with low vitamin D, even before drug therapy started - Oct 2015** Vitamin D Deficiency in Children With Newly Diagnosed Idiopathic Epilepsy **J Child Neurol October 2015 vol. 30 no. 11 1428-1432</h4><p>Fatma Mujgan Sonmez, MD1⇑, Ahsen Donmez, MD2, Mehmet Namuslu, MD3</p><p>Metin Canbal, MD4, Emel Orun, MD2</p><p>1Department of Child Neurology, Turgut Ozal University, Ankara, Turkey</p><p>2Department of Pediatrics, Turgut Ozal University, Ankara, Turkey</p><p>3Department of Biochemistry, Turgut Ozal University, Ankara, Turkey</p><p>4Department of Family Medicine, Turgut Ozal University, Ankara, Turkey</p><p>Fatma Mujgan Sonmez, MD, Department of Child Neurology, Turgut Ozal University, Alparslan Turkes Caddesi, No: 57 Emek, Ankara 06560, Turkey.

This study includes 60 newly diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy patients and 101 healthy controls (between the ages of 5 and 16). Each group was also divided into two subgroups according to seasonal changes in terms of months of longer versus shorter daylight. We retrospectively evaluated the levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and 25-OH vitamin-D3 in the study participants. Levels below 20 ng/ml were defined as vitamin D deficiency and levels of 20-30 ng/ml as insufficiency. There were no significant differences in age, gender distribution and levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone between the groups. The level of 25-OH vitamin-D3 in the patient group was significantly lower when compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05) (14.07 ± 8.12 and 23.38 ± 12.80 ng/ml, respectively). This difference also held true when evaluation was made according to seasonal evaluation (12.38 ± 6.53 and 17.64 ± 1.14 in shorter daylight and 18.71 ± 9.87 and 30.82 ± 1.04 in longer daylight).</p><hr><h4 id=idiopathic-epilepsyhttpwwwaboutkidshealthcaenresourcecentresepilepsyunderstandingepilepsydiagnosisclassificationpagesidiopathic-epilepsyaspx-at-aboutkidshealth><a href=http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/en/resourcecentres/epilepsy/understandingepilepsydiagnosis/classification/pages/idiopathic-epilepsy.aspx>Idiopathic Epilepsy</a> at AboutKidsHealth</h4><p>There are a variety of idiopathic epilepsy syndromes.

The terms “idiopathic epilepsy” and “cryptogenic epilepsy” are sometimes used interchangeably, especially in older books and articles.</strong> What causes idiopathic epilepsy? <strong>By definition, there is</strong> no apparent underlying cause of idiopathic epilepsy **, such as a structural problem with the brain or a metabolic disorder. It is possible that idiopathic epilepsy is caused by tiny abnormalities at the cellular level. We are now learning that many, although not all, idiopathic epilepsy syndromes have an associated genetic component.</p><p>In most cases, the exact way in which epilepsy is inherited is unclear.
