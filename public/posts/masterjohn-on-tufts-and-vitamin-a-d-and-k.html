I am, of course, very grateful that they thought it significant enough to investigate.</p><p>I first wrote about vitamin D&rsquo;s ability to protect against vitamin A toxicity in my article <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=fef651540b459f1ecb521258edcd97c2&amp;ur">&ldquo;Does Vitamin A Cause Osteoporosis?,&rdquo;</a> published in the Winter 2005/Spring 2006 Wise Traditions,and first wrote about vitamin A&rsquo;s ability to protect against vitamin D toxicity in my Fall 2006 article in the same journal, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=ad32d7d2760ba5a4bbbd014e68eb5067&amp;ur">&ldquo;From Seafood to Sunshine.&rdquo;</a> In a ==<a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=4ef7161b527c9b00ea57c54fd3daabdb&amp;ur">sidebar</a>==of that article, I suggested that &ldquo;vitamin D produces toxicity by depleting the body of vitamin K&rdquo; and that part of the mechanism by which vitamin A protects against vitamin D toxicity is by preventing the excessive production of vitamin K-dependent proteins, especially matrix Gla protein, also known as MGP:</p><p>It may be, then, that an extreme imbalance between vitamins A and D leads to the synthesis of abnormally high amounts of MGP. If there is enough vitamin K to activate all of the MGP, it will help protect the soft tissues from calcification. If, instead, the vitamin K cannot keep up with the level of MGP being produced and the pool of vitamin K becomes depleted, soft tissue calcification ensues.</p><p>I further elaborated on this theory in my Spring, 2007 article <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=ca3d121e80e597941a7b2cfe084d2ea6&amp;ur">&ldquo;On the Trail of the Elusive X Factor: Vitamin K2 Revealed,&rdquo;</a> published in Wise Traditions,and in my December, 2007 hypothesis paper <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=31d1cfbe5d2d4837a1d3012c7eeb8f59&amp;ur">&ldquo;Vitamin D Toxicity Redefined: Vitamin K and the Molecular Mechanism,&rdquo;</a> published in the peer-reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses.</p><p>That summer, when my hypothesis paper had been accepted but not yet published, I sent it to Drs. Xiang-Dong Wang and Heather Mernitz at Tufts University, who had just published a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=6fb3924e345e4af693e85bc4b2adb188&amp;ur">very interesting study</a> showing the ability of an activated vitamin A derivative to protect against kidney stones caused by activated vitamin D without antagonizing its ability to protect against lung cancer. At the time, it looked like I was going to get into the program at Tufts and they were excited about carrying out an investigation with me of the vitamin K-dependent protein expression in the tissues preserved from their experiment. Things didn&rsquo;t work out at some level higher than the lab, so I never wound up being part of the Tufts program.</p><p>In 2008, Dr. Wang&rsquo;s laboratory apparently followed through on the investigation and collaborated with the laboratory of Dr. Sarah Booth, head of the biochemical and molecular nutrition program there and renowned vitamin K expert, to confirm my hypothesis. The <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=139769712273&amp;h=c2ceb5fca47c5234c1ee5234fda88ad2&amp;ur">resulting paper</a> was pulished in the December, 2008 issue of the prestigious Journal of Nutrition.</p><p>In the two figures below, different letters above the bars indicate that the measurements represented by the bars are statistically significantly different from one another.</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/mj1.gif alt=image><p>The above figure from the paper confirms the first part of the hypothesis: that vitamin D (the third bar) causes a large increase in the production of MGP in the kidney and that when vitamin A is added in combination with vitamin D (the fourth bar) it brings the production of this protein back down to normal.</p><p>If the production of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as MGP exceeds the capacity of the vitamin K pool or the enzyme that uses vitamin K, the vitamin K carboxylase, to activate them, these proteins will be produced in a defective state. At best, they will not protect against soft tissue calcification, and at worst, they could perhaps actively faciliate soft tissue calcification. The active form of MGP is called &ldquo;carboyxlated MGP,&rdquo; while the defective form is called &ldquo;undercarboxylated MGP.&rdquo;</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/mj2.gif alt=image><p>In the above figure, part A shows the level of undercarboxylated, defective MGP; part B shows the level of carboxylated, active MPG; and part C shows the undercarboxylated-to-carboxylated MGP ratio, a lower ratio being better.</p><p>We can see a few important things here. First, activated vitamin D alone causes a marked increase in the defective form of MGP, and while activated vitamin A has no effect on the defective form alone, it brings the production of the defective form back down to normal when it is combined with activated vitamin D. Second, neither A nor D alone affect the production of the active form, but the two provided together synergistically increase the level of active MGP, which is what we want. Finally, we see that A improves the ratio all by itself, D dramatically worsens the ratio all by itself, and when the two vitamins are combined, they reduce the ratio with remarkable synergy.</p><p>Overall, then, we see that both vitamins are needed for optimal health. Vitamin A alone did nothing to benefit the kidneys or the lungs. Vitamin D alone caused a remarkable reduction in the ability of carcinogens associated with cigarette smoke to induce lung cancer but itself caused kidney stones. When vitamin A was combined with vitamin D, lung cancer was improved just as much, and the kidney calcification was completely eliminated. Moreover, the activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins in the kidney was much stronger with both vitamins than with neither treatment, suggesting that the vitamin A not only &ldquo;antagonizes&rdquo; vitamin D toxicity in the kidney, but that the two vitamins synergistically improve kidney health.</p><p>The authors made another interesting observation that I had not hypothesized: vitamins A and D appear to increase the turnover of vitamin K and the conversion of vitamin K1 to vitamin K2. In the D group, liver stores of K1 were reduced and kidney levels of MK-4, the form of vitamin K2 that animals synthesize, were increased. All A groups, whether the A was given alone or in combination with D, had reductions in both K1 and MK-4 levels. The authors referred to this as &ldquo;antagonism&rdquo; between vitamins A and K, but since vitamin A improved vitamin K-dependent activation of MGP, could it not be that the reduction in K1 was due to conversion of K1 to MK-4 and that the reduction in MK-4 was due to increased utilization and turnover of MK-4? The authors never suggested that vitamin D &ldquo;antagonizes&rdquo; vitamin K1, for example, even though its levels were reduced.</p><p>I have pointed out elsewhere that even modest amounts of vitamin D, whether provided by UV-light or in the diet, decrease liver stores of vitamin A; when the doses of D are larger, they decrease plasma levels of A as well. This suggests that vitamin D increases the need for and turnover of vitamin A. The data in the Tufts study suggest that vitamins D and A both increase the turnover of vitamin K2, but that vitamin A has a special effect of curbing the huge increase in the needfor vitamin K2 in the kidney. Thus, vitamin A both calms the waves rocking the boat of vitamin D toxicity while helping to steer the ship at the same time, navigating the passengers to safety.</p><p>Is the theory that the fat-soluble vitamins &ldquo;antagonize&rdquo; one another rather than cooperate with one other ready to die the death it has long deserved? There is a reason, of course, that traditional diets and lifestyles provided all three of them together — because they cooperate with one another to support life, growth, and radiant health.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/bone.html><span class=tag>bone</span></a>
