### Founders of Google have shown very strong interests in improved health

* Sergey Brin: 50% chance of getting Parkinson's disease ( 30-75%)

   * Brin has donated $132m to create DNA database of 7,000 patients and to support work on treatments for the condition

* Larry Page  has a rare nerve disease that affects his vocal chords and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

* Both Brin and Page have long been fixated on how to use data analysis to predict and track disease.

### Google spun-off Calico with moonshot chance of curing Cancer in next 20 years (Sept 2013)

* Note: Curing Cancer would extend the average lifespan by 3 years

### VitainDWiki suggests that Calico should also invest in restoring Vitamin D levels

* Strong indications that Vitamin D can prevent [Parkinson’s Disease](/tags/parkinsons-disease.html) ( **<span style="color:#F00;">Brin</span>** )

* [Hashimoto's thyroiditis ( **<span style="color:#F00;">Page</span>** ) does decrease levels of vitamin D](/tags/hashimotos-thyroiditis-span-stylecolorf00pagespan-does-decrease-levels-of-vitamin-d.html) 

   * Vitamin D might be able to treat Hashimoto's thyroiditis - research (funded by Page/Calico?) is needed

* [Doubling vitamin D levels should increase lifespan by 2 years](/tags/doubling-vitamin-d-levels-should-increase-lifespan-by-2-years.html)

   * which should also extend the quality of the life by perhaps 10 years

* Improve productivity of Google employees  [Workplace Wellness and Vitamin D](/tags/workplace-wellness-and-vitamin-d.html)

   * Fewer days of sick leave

   * Able to concentrate better on the job (when not sick)

   * Fewer problems during and after pregnancy 

   * Decreased flu and colds

* Improve global health and wellness, just as Google improved global information access

### Some candidate Calico funding:

1. Large Intervention trial to double Vitamin D levels – and observe the outcome

   * Note: A doctor found that when approximately doubling the vitamin D levels  of all of his patients that they decreased office visits for all reasons from 4 per year down to just 1.

1. Restore vitamin D levels of some (Google?) employees & families and observe difference in sick leave, performance, etc.  This could be a Random Controlled Trial

1. Trial of benefit of UVB lighting (which increases vitamin D levels) on health and productivity

   * Note: [UVB lighting experiment in a grade school classroom](/tags/uvb-lighting-experiment-in-a-grade-school-classroom.html) found better attendance, decreased increase in body fat, better test scores, and 5X fewer cavities

1. Selectively install [widow panes which are transparent in UVB](/tags/widow-panes-which-are-transparent-in-uvb.html) – which creates vitamin D

   * Monitor sick leave of employees working near these special windows.

1. Focus on low-hanging fruit – improve the vitamin D levels of employees who are in groups which are vitamn D deficient

   * Pregnant, 

   * Stay indoors most of the time (virtually all programmers?)

   * Darker skins (Asians, Indians, African-Americans)&nbsp; &nbsp; [Global Google](http://www.google.com/about/company/facts/locations/%20) – many offices where dark skin in the norm

   * Many Google offices are far from or very near to the equator (less UVB, darker skin)

### Vitamin D will square the curve (live longer AND healthier)
