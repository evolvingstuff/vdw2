#### [Red grapes, blueberries may enhance immune function](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130917125022.htm) Science Daily

* “Both of these compounds (resveratrol and pterostilbene), which are called stilbenoids, worked in synergy with vitamin D and had a significant impact in raising the expression of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, or CAMP gene, that is involved in immune function.”

* It is well known that more vitamin D getting to cells increases the [immune system](/categories/immunity).

* “Stilbenoids are compounds produced by plants to fight infections, and in human biology appear to affect some of the signaling pathways that allow vitamin D to do its job, researchers said. It appears that combining these compounds with vitamin D has considerably more biological impact than any of them would separately”

> Note: there is some indication that applying pesticides to grapes/blueberries reduces the amount of stilbenoids which they produce – the plants no longer need them.  For that reason I try to only use organic grapes and blueberries.
