## Modulation of multiple sclerosis by sunlight exposure: Role of cis-urocanic acid

Jorge Correale jcorreale@fleni.org.ar ,     Mauricio F. Farez

Received 16 March 2013; published online 24 June 2013.

The role of cis-urocanic acid (UCA) as a UV-mediated immunomodulator in MS patients was investigated. Plasma levels of cis-UCA were significantly lower in MS patients compared to controls. Stimulation of MBP- and MOG-specific T cells in the presence of cis-UCA, significantly increased IL-10, and inhibited IFN-γ production. PBMCs cultured in the presence of cis-UCA increased CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cell percentages. Dendritic cells cultured in the presence of cis-UCA significantly reduced Ag presentation capacity. Finally, cis-UCA activated the 5-HT2A receptor, inducing the increase in phosphorylated forms of ERK 1/2 and JNK2. Thus, in addition to vitamin D, cis-UCA also appears to be an additional UV-mediated immunomodulator.

## Highlights (by publisher)

* Relapsing remitting MS patients had significantly lower levels of cis-UCA.

* cis-UCA increased IL-10 secretion and inhibited IFN-γ production by T cells.

* cis-UCA increased the number of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells.

* cis-UCA reduced Ag presentation capacity by dendritic cells.

## Comments by VitaminDWiki

1. This may explain why UV appears to be more important than vitamin D in treating MS

1. This may explain why people believe that you should not take a shower after being in the sun

> urocanic acid is in the sweat, vs vitamin D is below the surface of the skin

Objective: To study the role of cis-urocanic acid (UCA) in MS pathogenesis.

Background UCA is a major absorber of UV radiation in the skin. Formed as a trans-isomer from histidine in the upper epidermis, it converts to a systemically-distributed cis-isomer on exposure to sunlight, conferring immunosuppression.

Design/Methods: Ninety-two patients with relapsing remitting MS were examined, fifty-eight patients in remission and 32 during exacerbations. Forty age and gender-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Trans-, and cis-UCA plasma levels were measured by HPLC. MBP- and MOG peptide-specific T cell lines were stimulated with cognate antigens (Ags) in presence and in absence of cis-UCA, whereupon IL-4, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-{gamma}, and PGE2 were measured using ELISA. CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells were assessed using flow cytometry.

Results: Plasma levels of cis-UCA were significantly lower in MS patients compared to controls (p= 0.001). 

In contrast, no differences in plasma trans-UCA levels were found between groups, nor was any association found between disease activity and plasma cis-UCA levels. 

Stimulation of MBP- and MOG-specific T cells with specific Ags in the presence of cis-UCA significantly increased IL-10 and PGE2 secretion, and inhibited IFN-{gamma} production. No effect was observed on the secretion of the other cytokines investigated. Moreover, PBMCs cultured in the presence of cis-UCA increased CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cell percentages 3 to 12-fold. Finally, dendritic cells cultured in the presence of cis-UCA significantly reduced their Ags presentation capacity, when proliferation and cytokines secretion were measured as read-outs of T cell activation.

Conclusions: In addition to Vitamin D, cis-UCA represents an additional UV-mediated immunomodulator, which may help explain the increased prevalence of MS observed at higher latitudes.
