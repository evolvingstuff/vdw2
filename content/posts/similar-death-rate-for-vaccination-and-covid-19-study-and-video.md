Background: COVID-19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and benefits. 

Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases reporting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side effects. 

Result: 

* The NNTV is between 200–700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while 

* the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. 

The number of cases experiencing  **adverse reactions**  has been reported to be 700 per 100,000 vaccinations. 

Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. 

 **For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two (deaths) inflicted by vaccination.** 

Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.
