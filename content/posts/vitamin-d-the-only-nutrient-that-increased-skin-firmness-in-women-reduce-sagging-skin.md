#### Nutrition and youthful skin - Sept 2021

Clinics in Dermatology Volume 39, Issue 5, September–October 2021, Pages 796-808 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clindermatol.2021.05.007

Nutrition and dietary supplements have been used to promote a youthful appearance for millennia. Despite high public demand for these products, evidence supporting their efficacy is limited and often inconsistent. We discuss the structural and functional changes that occur in the skin during the aging process. We also review evidence supporting the use of nutritional supplements commonly used to promote a youthful appearance, including essential fatty acids, coenzyme Q, collagen peptides, curcumin, polyphenols, flavonoids, probiotics, silymarin, and vitamins A, C, D, and E. We also consider the role of advanced glycosylated end products, antiinflammatory diets, and caloric restriction in delaying premature skin aging. Although evidence supporting the use of some dietary interventions is promising, further long-term studies in humans are required to fully understand their effects on the promotion of a youthful appearance.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays several important roles in the human body, including the regulation of calcium homeostasis and the maintenance of bone mineralization.7 It has a number of health benefits, including the prevention of cancer, promotion of cardiovascular health, and protection against autoimmune disease.7 Sources of vitamin D include sunlight and dietary intake.8 Skin is the major source of ultraviolet-B (UVB) mediated vitamin D synthesis. UVB radiation from the sun promotes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) which is subsequently hydroxylated into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol) and then into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol).8 Vitamin D may also be obtained through the diet. Natural sources that are rich in vitamin D include cod-liver oil, salmon, mackerel, egg yolks, and cheese.7 Foods, such as milk, orange juice, and cereal, are commonly fortified with vitamin D.7

Vitamin D may play an important role in the maintenance of youthful-appearing skin. By maintaining the integrity of facial bones, vitamin D promotes the scaffolding and support underlying the skin. A deficiency in vitamin D may lead to demineralization of the gingival bones, especially in edentulous patients, leading to the formation of wrinkles around the mouth and inward turning of the lips.7 Patients with such clinical presentations should be evaluated for vitamin D deficiency.

Vitamin D also plays an important role in the maintenance of healthy appearing hair. Vitamin D receptor expression is upregulated during the late anagen and catagen stages of the hair cycle.9 This promotes keratinocyte differentiation, which is important for progression through the hair cycle.9 Low serum vitamin D has been associated with an increased incidence of telogen effluvium and androgenetic alopecia in women.10 Patients presenting with these conditions should be screened for vitamin D deficiency and receive vitamin D supplementation if deficient.11

Vitamin D may also play a role in wound healing via modulation of skin immunity and upregulation of cathelicidin in keratinocytes.12 Cathelicidin modulates skin inflammation and promotes angiogenesis within injured skin, and in early tissue repair, cathelicidin expression is upregulated.12 Vitamin D supplementation may expedite wound healing in patients. In one randomized controlled trial, 60 patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers received either 50,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or a placebo every 2 weeks for a total of 12 weeks.13 Those who received vitamin D demonstrated marked improvement in healing of the ulcer as compared with those receiving placebo.13 In another trial, 26 patients with leg ulcers were randomized to receive either 50,000 IU vitamin D or a placebo weekly for 2 months.14 At the end of 2 months, patients receiving vitamin D demonstrated greater healing of their leg ulcers.14 This effect approached, but did not reach, significance. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency appears to be greater in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. A study compared 104 patients with diabetic foot ulcers to 99 healthy patients without diabetes and 103 patients with diabetes without foot ulcers and found that patients with diabetic foot ulcers were significantly more likely to be vitamin D deficient than controls.15

Vitamin D has numerous beneficial effects, and it has also been associated with a reduced risk of overall cancer mortality by 16%;16 however, the relationship between vitamin D levels and skin cancer, in particular melanoma, is still controversial. Excessive long-term intake of vitamin D supplementation can also have adverse effects and lead to toxicity.  **Although vitamin D appears to be linked to youthful-appearing skin and hair** , certain levels of vitamin D in the serum may be associated with photoaging. One study found that patients who were deficient in vitamin D were less likely to have photodamage when compared with those who had normal levels of vitamin D.17 This may be because sunlight is a major source of vitamin D and also leads to photodamage. Limiting unprotected sun exposure is likely prudent given that excess sunlight may accelerate photoaging and increase the risk of skin cancer.18

Many women pay attention to skin aging. Signs of aging such as lines, wrinkles, dry skin, hyperpigmentation, and loss of elasticity affect skin appearance and self-confidence. Age, lifestyle, and particularly UV irradiation stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS induces the breakdown of collagen through matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Collagen and elastin play a pivotal role in skin aging. They maintain skin integrity, strength, and resiliency. Antioxidant and keratolytic agents are often used in anti-aging products, including several vitamins such as vitamin A, B, C and E. To date, several studies have been reported in the literature for the  **effects of vitamin D on collagen synthesis and MMPs inhibition** . This review focuses on identifying and assessing the molecular pathways of vitamin D effects related to skin aging. 

The literature was collected from Google Scholar, Elsevier, Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus databases and accessed between January 2019 and May 2022. The literature screening was conducted using keywords like “vitamin D3”, “collagen”, “matrix metalloproteinases”, “skin aging” and related to the study topic were included. The effect of vitamin D3 on MMPs inhibition (particularly on MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9) has been widely published. Several studies have reported that vitamin D increases collagen synthesis and clinically improves skin elasticity. However, there have been controversial results regarding how vitamin D3 affects transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) correlated with skin elasticity by the molecular pathway. Therefore, it can be concluded that vitamin D3 is a potential alternative agent in improving skin aging.

#### Does increasing Vitamin D decrease sagging skin?

Asked [Perplexity AI Nov 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-does-skin-firmness-relate-p4ERNDLhTjWu0Jndc7BcJg)

Vitamin D plays a significant role in maintaining skin firmness and reducing sagging through multiple mechanisms.

 **Collagen Production and Protection** 

Vitamin D supports skin firmness by:

* Increasing collagen synthesis and improving skin elasticity&nbsp;[1](https://journal.ugm.ac.id/v3/IJP/article/view/4929)

* Decreasing collagenase, an enzyme that degrades collagen&nbsp;[6](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9284/11/2/37)

* Protecting existing collagen from breakdown through antioxidant effects&nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8396468/)

 **Protective Mechanisms** 

 **UV Protection** 

Vitamin D helps prevent skin sagging by protecting against UV damage through:

* Repairing DNA damage

* Reducing oxidative stress

* Decreasing chronic inflammation&nbsp;[5](https://www.explorationpub.com/Journals/em/Article/1001225)

 **Skin Barrier Function** 

The vitamin strengthens the skin's natural defenses by:

* Supporting skin barrier repair

* Reducing inflammatory mediators

* Enhancing the skin's resilience against environmental factors&nbsp; [4](https://escapepv.com/the-surprising-connection-between-vitamin-d-skincare-and-overall-wellness/)

 **Clinical Benefits** 

Research demonstrates that maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can:

* Slow down the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles

* Contribute to firmer, more youthful-looking skin

* Support overall skin health and structure&nbsp;[4](https://escapepv.com/the-surprising-connection-between-vitamin-d-skincare-and-overall-wellness/)

However, vitamin D production naturally decreases with age, with levels declining approximately 50% between ages 20 and 80 &nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8396468/)

This reduction can contribute to decreased skin firmness and increased sagging, making vitamin D supplementation or careful sun exposure potentially beneficial for maintaining skin firmness.
