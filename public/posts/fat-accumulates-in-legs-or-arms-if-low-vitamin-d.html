We hypothesized that serum 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with total, appendicular, and truncal fat deposition. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was categorized into sufficient (≥75.0 nM), insufficient (50.0–74.9 nM), and deficient (&lt;50.0 nM) groups. Fat mass (FM) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and FM index (FMI) was calculated by dividing FM (kg) with height2 (m2). Multivariant linear regression and Granger causal analysis were performed to assess the causal relationship between vitamin D status and regional FMIs. Overall serum 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with total (β = –0.029, standard error <span>[SE]</span> = 0.002), trunk (β = –0.015, SE = 0.001), arms (β = –0.004, SE = 3.09 × 10−4), and legs (β = –0.010, SE = 0.001) FMIs in all participants (P &lt; .001, respectively); however, after stratified by vitamin D status and BMI, the negative associations were only observed in individuals with vitamin D deficiency and obesity. The causal analysis indicated that serum 25(OH)D concentrations may causally reduce the arms (F = 4.917, probability <span>[P]</span> = 0.007), legs (F = 5.783, P = 0.003), and total (F = 3.202, P = 0.041) FMIs except for trunk FMI but not vice versa. In conclusion, poor vitamin D status was associated with increased total and appendicular body fat deposition in US adults, particularly in participants with obesity.</p><p>The aim of the study was to explore the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations and body fat deposition in adults. The results showed that poor vitamin D status was associated with increased total and appendicular body fat deposition in US adults, particularly in participants with obesity.Download</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Obesity has affected around 1.5 billion adults globally, and it may increase the risks of many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases <sup>[1,2]</sup>. The overall cost of health care related to obesity is expected to double every 10 years <sup>[3]</sup>, with medical costs for people with obesity forecast to be 30% more than those people with normal weight <sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is a global epidemic affecting more than 1 billion children and adults around the world <sup>[5]</sup>. Vitamin D deficiency was commonly noticed in individuals with obesity <sup>[6]</sup>. Inadequate intake of vitamin D, poor dietary habits, and low sunlight exposure are important risk factors for vitamin D deficiency <sup>[5]</sup>. It has been reported that body fat acts as a storage site for lipid-soluble vitamin D, and higher body fat deposition increases its sequestration in adipose tissues <sup>[7]</sup>. Meanwhile, adiposity-initiated insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis can reduce the 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> synthesis in liver, which resulted in low bioavailability of this precursor hormone <sup>[7]</sup>. On the other hand, low vitamin D may be implicated in adipose tissue differentiation and growth, which leads to obesity by regulating expression of genes involved in parathyroid hormone, calcium, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling pathways <sup>[6,8]</sup>.</p><p>Multiple studies evaluated the associations between vitamin D and obesity; however, <strong>the results remain controversial</strong> <sup>[6,9,10]</sup>. In addition, most studies focus on obesity assessed by body mass index (BMI) rather than fat deposition in different body areas <sup>[11]</sup>. A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study (up to 42,024 participants) found each 1-kg/m2 increment of BMI was associated with a 1.15% lower 25(OH)D; however, genetically lower 25(OH)D was not causally associated with BMI <sup>[11]</sup>. Another randomized double-blind clinical study included participants with suboptimal vitamin D concentrations <span>[25(OH)D &lt;75 nM]</span>, who were provided with either vitamin D (4000 IU/d) or placebo for 4 months, and the study reported that only adults with obesity and metabolically unhealthy phenotype may benefit from vitamin D treatment <sup>[12]</sup>. Further, vitamin D supplementation improved adipose tissue inflammation and hepatic steatosis but did not reduce weight gain or obesity in mice received high-fat and high-glucose diets <sup>[13]</sup>. However, in another study, vitamin D supplementation decreased body weight gain and abdominal fat deposition and ameliorated the plasma lipid profiles in Western diet-fed obese rats <sup>[8]</sup>. Thus, the relationship between vitamin D and obesity is still inconclusive and further investigations are needed.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the relationship and exploratory causality between serum 25(OH)D and total, appendicular and truncal body fat mass (FM) in US adults who participated in the 2011–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The results may provide evidence supporting relationships between serum 25(OH)D and appendicular body fat deposition in US adults.</p><p><strong>Section snippets</strong></p><p>Study design and participants recruitments</p><p>The NHANES is a large cross-sectional study designed to assess the nutritional status and health outcomes across the United States <sup>[14]</sup>. The survey began in the 1960s and consisted mainly of interviews and physical examinations. Since 1999, the survey has been performed with a 2-year cycle, and approximately 5000 participants are recruited each year. A total of 39,156 participants recruited between 2011 and 2018 were included in current study, and those younger than age 18 years (n = 15,331), . . . .</p><p>Characteristics, body measurements, and DXA parameters of participants grouped by serum vitamin D status</p><p>The main characteristics, body measurements and DXA parameters of the study participants grouped by serum 25(OH)D concentrations are shown in Table 1. A total of 11,307 adults (5613 males and 5694 females) with a mean age of 37.75 years (standard deviation = 12.39) were recruited, and the blood vitamin D concentrations were determined in winter/spring (n = 5530, 48.91%) or summer/fall (n = 5,777, 51.09%). Overall, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was 37.50% and vitamin D deficiency . . . .</p><p>Discussion</p><p>In this study, we found that serum 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with total and appendicular but not truncal body fat deposition in US adults, especially in subjects with vitamin D deficiency and obesity. Several epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between vitamin D concentrations and body fat mass. Consistent with our results, Looker et al. examined the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and body fat percent by race in 6042 women aged >12 years in . . . .</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were negatively associated with total and regional (arms, legs, and trunk) fat deposition, particularly in individuals with vitamin D deficiency and obesity. Moreover, poor vitamin D status may causally increase appendicular fat deposition. Therefore, our results indicated that maintaining vitamin D in a sufficient status may reduce the risk of total and appendicular fat deposition in populations with hypovitaminosis D and obesity.
