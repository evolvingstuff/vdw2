OBJECTIVE:

To determine the prevalence of vitamin D supplement use in Canadian adults and associations with demographic and socio-economic variables.

DESIGN:

Data from the Healthy Aging module of the Canadian Community Health Survey were used to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D supplement use in Canadians aged 45 years and over. The prevalence of supplement use stratified by various behavioural and demographic characteristics was calculated and adjusted models were used to find associations with those factors.

SETTING:

The ten provinces of Canada.

SUBJECTS:

Canadians aged 45 years and over who participated in the Healthy Aging module of the Canadian Community Health Survey from 2008-2009.

RESULTS:

The highest observed prevalence for 

* women was 48·0 % in the 65-69 years age group and the highest prevalence for 

* men was 25·3 % in the 70-74 years age group. 

Women had higher odds of vitamin D supplement use than men in all age groups. 

Not using supplements was 

* more common in smokers,

* those who did not engage in leisure-time physical activities and who were either 

* overweight or obese. 

Vitamin D supplement use increased with household income and level of education, and decreased with self-perceived health. Supplement use was higher in those with chronic conditions.

CONCLUSIONS:

The inverse association with self-perceived health could be partly explained by age, chronic conditions and increased use of health-care services. Associations with higher income and education suggest a strong socio-economic influence and that individuals may not have the expendable income to purchase vitamin D supplements or knowledge of their health benefits.
