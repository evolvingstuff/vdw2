#### How does earthing affect blood viscosity in people with diabetes (asked Perplexity AI Oct 2024

<!-- ~tc~  do not change the above title - it is used by another page ~/tc~ -->

Based on the search results, earthing has several significant effects on blood viscosity in people with diabetes:

 **Imediate Blood Viscosity Effects** 

Earthing produces rapid improvements in blood viscosity through increased zeta potential of red blood cells, with effects visible within two hours &nbsp;[1](https://earthinginstitute.net/how-grounding-affects-blood-viscosity/)

For diabetic patients specifically, this results in:

* Improved blood cell movement and reduced clumping

* Enhanced circulation to smaller blood vessels

* Better blood flow throughout the body&nbsp;[2](https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/)

 **Clinical Benefits for Diabetics** 

 **Circulation Improvements:** 

* Resolves numbness in diabetic feet, with 25 out of 25 diabetic patients showing significant improvement

* Visible improvements in blood viscosity during blood draws, with reduced clotting in needles during collection&nbsp;[2](https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/)

 **Blood Sugar Impact:** 

* Three days and two nights of continuous grounding showed decreased glucose levels in diabetic patients

* May require sustained grounding of at least three nights to achieve significant glucose reductions&nbsp;[2](https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/)

 **Long-term Effects** 

 **Medication Changes:** 

* Some diabetic patients have experienced reduced insulin requirements

* One patient reduced daily insulin from 80 units to 10-20 units

* Another patient only requires insulin with dietary indiscretions&nbsp;[2](https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/)

 **Important Considerations** 

 **Medical Monitoring:** 

* Diabetic patients on prescription medications should consult their doctors before starting earthing

* Blood sugar and medication dosages may need adjustment due to earthing's systemic effects&nbsp;[2](https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/)

The improvements in blood viscosity appear to be related to earthing's ability to reduce inflammation and increase the negative charge on red blood cells, which is particularly beneficial for diabetics who often have poor red blood cell zeta potential&nbsp;[1](https://earthinginstitute.net/how-grounding-affects-blood-viscosity/)&nbsp;[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3576907/)

!!!!How does earthing affect blood viscosity in people with diabetes (asked Perplexity AI Oct 2024
~tc~  do not change the above title - it is used by another page ~/tc~
Based on the search results, earthing has several significant effects on blood viscosity in people with diabetes:
~~#00F:__Imediate Blood Viscosity Effects__~~
Earthing produces rapid improvements in blood viscosity through increased zeta potential of red blood cells, with effects visible within two hours ~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/how-grounding-affects-blood-viscosity/|1]
For diabetic patients specifically, this results in:
*Improved blood cell movement and reduced clumping
*Enhanced circulation to smaller blood vessels
*Better blood flow throughout the body~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/|2]
~~#00F:__Clinical Benefits for Diabetics__~~
__Circulation Improvements:__
*Resolves numbness in diabetic feet, with 25 out of 25 diabetic patients showing significant improvement
*Visible improvements in blood viscosity during blood draws, with reduced clotting in needles during collection~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/|2]
__Blood Sugar Impact:__
*Three days and two nights of continuous grounding showed decreased glucose levels in diabetic patients
*May require sustained grounding of at least three nights to achieve significant glucose reductions~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/|2]
~~#00F:__Long-term Effects__~~
__Medication Changes:__
*Some diabetic patients have experienced reduced insulin requirements
*One patient reduced daily insulin from 80 units to 10-20 units
*Another patient only requires insulin with dietary indiscretions~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/|2]
~~#00F:__Important Considerations__~~
__Medical Monitoring:__
*Diabetic patients on prescription medications should consult their doctors before starting earthing
*Blood sugar and medication dosages may need adjustment due to earthing&#39;s systemic effects~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/new-hope-for-diabetes/|2]
The improvements in blood viscosity appear to be related to earthing&#39;s ability to reduce inflammation and increase the negative charge on red blood cells, which is particularly beneficial for diabetics who often have poor red blood cell zeta potential~hs~[https://earthinginstitute.net/how-grounding-affects-blood-viscosity/|1]~hs~[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3576907/|3]
