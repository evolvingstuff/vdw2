 **Low Response: Vitamin D Binding Protein**

 **High Response: CYP27B1

A poor 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) status is a much replicated risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS), and several vitamin D-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with a higher risk of MS. However, studies on the benefit of vitamin D supplementation in MS show inconclusive results. Here, we explore whether vitamin D-associated SNPs and MS risk alleles confound serological response to vitamin D supplementation.

Methods

34 participants from the SOLARIUM study consented to genotyping, of which 26 had vitamin D data available. The SOLARIUM study randomised relapsing-remitting MS patients to placebo or 14,000 IU vitamin D3 for 48 weeks. Participants were categorised as either ‘carriers’ or ‘non-carriers’ of the risk allele for 4 SNPs: two related to D binding protein (DBP) and associated with lower 25(OH)D levels (rs4588 and rs7041), and two related to vitamin D metabolism enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 and associated with a higher risk of MS (rs12368653; rs2248359, respectively). 25(OH)D levels were determined at baseline and after 48 weeks.

Results

The DBP-related SNPs showed no difference in 25(OH)D status at baseline, but carriers of the rs7041 risk allele showed lower 25(OH)D-levels compared to non-carriers after 48 weeks of supplementation (median 224.2 vs. 332.0 nmol/L, p = 0.013). For CYP related SNPs, neither showed a difference at baseline, but carriers of the rs12368653 risk allele showed higher 25(OH)D-levels compared to non-carriers after 48 weeks of supplementation (median 304.1 vs. 152.0 nmol/L, p = 0.014).

Discussion

Vitamin D-related SNPs affect the serological response to high-dose vitamin D supplementation. The effects on more common doses of vitamin D, as well as the clinical consequence of this altered response, need to be investigated further.
