* "The agency was forced by a federal judge to disclose the reports."

* The previously released reports were based on check-the-box data

* The newly released data is from free-form text input, which the CDC did not know how to summarize

   * Strange: Amazon and many others know how to summarize free-form data

* "The free-text portion of the surveys was the only place for people to report adverse events, including heart inflammation, even though the CDC knew the vaccines might cause those events, previously released documents show. Other documents show that the CDC became aware of the vaccines possibly causing myocarditis, or heart inflammation, and a related condition called pericarditis early in 2021 but hid the knowledge from the public."

* "The first two tranches, made up of 780,000 reports from some 523,000 people, include dozens of reports of heart inflammation, hundreds of reports of facial paralysis, and thousands of reports of tinnitus."
