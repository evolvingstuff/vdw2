* “How reliable are DEXA scans? Results vary significantly based on machine, operator, and measured bones, with studies showing a 5% - 6% difference in bone density.”

* Is repeated scanning necessary? A study of 4124 older women found no additional useful information gained from repeating DEXA scans over 8 years. Yet, guidelines recommend scans every 1-2 years, with Medicare covering one every 2 years, despite costs ranging from $150 to $300 per scan.”

* Note: I recently learned from Dr. Mercola that a faster and more accurate method of diagnosing  **bone strength**  (which does not expose patients to ionizing radiation) is beginning to be used in Europe. [REMS technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10217295/) works by sending ultrasound waves into the bone and then analyzing the spectrum created to assess the health of the bones.”

   * Back when Fosamax annual sales were $3 billion the company gave free DEXA scan machines to many medical organizations

* "Bisphosphonates are associated with numerous side effects, such as stomach irritation, severe muscle and bone pain, flu-like symptoms, osteonecrosis of the jaw, unusual hip fractures, atrial fibrillation, hypocalcemia, fatigue, and kidney problems. Remarkably, the American Dental Association even cautioned its members to avoid working on patients who are taking bisphosphonates.”

#### Vitamin D enhances ability of Fosamax to treat osteoporosis - Perplexity AI - July 2024

Combining vitamin D with Fosamax can enhance the efficacy of osteoporosis treatment. Vitamin D supplementation ensures adequate calcium absorption, which is necessary for the optimal effect of bisphosphonates like Fosamax. Studies have shown that adequate vitamin D levels are necessary to maximize the response to bisphosphonate treatment in terms of both BMD changes and fracture risk reduction

*“How reliable are DEXA scans? Results vary significantly based on machine, operator, and measured bones, with studies showing a 5% - 6% difference in bone density.”
*Is repeated scanning necessary? A study of 4124 older women found no additional useful information gained from repeating DEXA scans over 8 years. Yet, guidelines recommend scans every 1-2 years, with Medicare covering one every 2 years, despite costs ranging from $150 to $300 per scan.”
*Note: I recently learned from Dr. Mercola that a faster and more accurate method of diagnosing __bone strength__ (which does not expose patients to ionizing radiation) is beginning to be used in Europe. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10217295/|REMS technology] works by sending ultrasound waves into the bone and then analyzing the spectrum created to assess the health of the bones.”
**Back when Fosamax annual sales were $3 billion the company gave free DEXA scan machines to many medical organizations
*&quot;Bisphosphonates are associated with numerous side effects, such as stomach irritation, severe muscle and bone pain, flu-like symptoms, osteonecrosis of the jaw, unusual hip fractures, atrial fibrillation, hypocalcemia, fatigue, and kidney problems. Remarkably, the American Dental Association even cautioned its members to avoid working on patients who are taking bisphosphonates.”

!!!!Vitamin D enhances ability of Fosamax to treat osteoporosis - Perplexity AI - July 2024
Combining vitamin D with Fosamax can enhance the efficacy of osteoporosis treatment. Vitamin D supplementation ensures adequate calcium absorption, which is necessary for the optimal effect of bisphosphonates like Fosamax. Studies have shown that adequate vitamin D levels are necessary to maximize the response to bisphosphonate treatment in terms of both BMD changes and fracture risk reduction
