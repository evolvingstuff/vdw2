Want to catch and stop or reverse Osteopenia before it becomes Osteoporosis

It is very difficult (impossible?) to reverse Osteoporosis - by then too many "bone bridges" are gone

 **Magnesium is removed by water softeners** 

* "Soft water"  is free from dissolved salts of such metals as calcium, iron, or  **magnesium** , which form insoluble deposits such as appear as scale in boilers or soap curds in bathtubs and laundry equipment.

* "A typical residential ion-exchange water softener softens hard water by exchanging calcium and  **magnesium**  for sodium"

   * A quick search of the web was unable to find how much Magnesium is removed:  50%, 80 %, 90%?

* [ **Reverse osmosis**  removes 93-99% of all  **Magnesium**  and Calcium](https://www.aqualiv.com/reverse-osmosis-water-filter-health/)

Osteopenia is a term to define bone density that is not normal but also not as low as osteoporosis. 

By definition from the World Health Organization osteopenia is defined by bone densitometry as a T score -1 to -2.5. 

There are many causes for osteopenia including calcium and vitamin D deficiency and inactivity. Genetics plays an important role in a person's bone mineral density and often Caucasian women with a thin body habitus who are premenopausal are found to have osteopenia. 

Correction of calcium and vitamin D deficiency and walking 3 to 5 miles a week can often improve bone density in the hip and spine. 

There are a variety of pharmaceutical agents that have been recommended for the treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis including hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy, anti-resorptive therapy. In addition patients with osteoporosis who have failed anti-resorptive therapy can have a significant improvement in their bone density with anabolic therapy.
