Participants selected had <30 ng/mL and erectile dysfunction 

Dosing started with monthly 600,000 IU  of Vitamin D2

Their goal was to have > 30 ng of serum vitamin D

They reduced the dose to bimonthly 600,000 IU of Vitamin D2 when > 30 ng

 **Comment by VitaminDWiki** 

* Many consider biomonthly to be too infrequent for D3 and far too infrequent for D2

* Probably get better results if they had started with 400,000 IU of vitamin D3 every 20 days

> And then cut back to 200,000 IU of D3 every 20 days

* It is very unlikely that a single dose of vitamin D2 or D3 could still cause increases at 12 months.

> It is more likely that the increases were due to the summer sun (trial had ended in Sept)

Background: The associations between serum vitamin D (VD), serum testosterone (TT) and metabolic syndrome are complex and with limited published research, particularly on the effects of VD treatment on sexual hormones, erectile function and the metabolic syndrome. 

Objectives: This study assessed whether a monthly high dose VD treatment for 12 months in VD deficient middle-aged men was associated with: changes in levels of sexual hormones, improvement of diabetes control and metabolic syndrome components, better erectile function <span>[International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 questionnaire]</span>; and changes in a prostate marker.

Materials and methods: Descriptive research of a prospective study, conducted between October  2014 and September 2015, 102 male patients >35 <span>[(±SD: 53.2 ±10.5), (range 35-64)]</span> years with deficient serum VD level (<30ng/mL) were included in the study. Participants were followed up for one year, with monitoring at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months. At the initial baseline visit, a complete medical examination was conducted, and blood was drawn for laboratory tests for above biochemical and hormonal variables under examination. Participants received an initial VD (Ergocalciferol; oral solution 600000 IU/1.5 ml), and followed a VD treatment regime thereafter. At the four follow up visits (3, 6, 9 and 12 months), blood was collected, and patients' erectile function was evaluated by IIEF-5 questionnaire.

Main outcome measures: During the follow up visits, all the biochemical and hormonal (TT, estradiol and luteinizing hormones, HbA1c, serum lipids profile) were assessed, and patients' erectile function was evaluated by IIEF-5 questionnaire.

Results: Patients' mean age was 53.2 ±10.4 years. Serum VD exhibited significant increments (p<0.001) from baseline (15.16±4.64 ng/mL), to 

* 3 (months) (31.90 ± 15.99 ng/mL), 

* 6 (Months) (37.23 ± 12.42 ng/mL), 

* 9 (months) (44.88± 14.49 ng/mL) and 

* 12 months (48.54± 11.62 ng/mL), 

and there was significant stepladder increases in both 

* serum TT level (12.46±3.30 to 15.99± 1.84nmol/L) and 

* erectile function scores (13.88±3.96 to 20.25±3.24) (p<0.001 for both). 

We also observed significant stepladder decreases in 

* estradiol (87.90±27.16 to 69.85± 14.80 pmol/L, p = 0.001), 

* PTH (from 58.52 ±28.99 to 38.33 ± 19.44pg/mL, p <0.001) and 

* HbA1c levels (7.41 ±2.85 to 6.66 ± 1.67%, p = 0.001). 

* Mean BMI significantly decreased from 33.91 ±6.67 to 33.14 ±6.35 kg/m2 (p = 0.001); and 

* PSA values significantly increased from 0.59±0.30 to 0.82 ±0.39 ng/mL (p <0.001) 

at the end of the 12 months' follow-up. There were no changes in LH levels.

Conclusion: This study demonstrated that VD treatment improves testosterone levels, metabolic syndrome and erectile function in middle-aged men. More randomized placebo-controlled interventional trials of VD treatment in patients with the metabolic syndrome and low TT could assist in uncovering the putative roles of VD.
