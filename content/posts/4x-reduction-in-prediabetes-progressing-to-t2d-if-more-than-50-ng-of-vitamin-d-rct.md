Background: The role of vitamin D in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes remains unclear.

Purpose: To evaluate whether administration of vitamin D decreases risk for diabetes among people with prediabetes.

Data sources: PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception through 9 December 2022.

Study selection: Eligible trials that were specifically designed and conducted to test the effects of oral vitamin D versus placebo on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes.

Data extraction: The primary outcome was time to event for new-onset diabetes. Secondary outcomes were regression to normal glucose regulation and adverse events. Prespecified analyses (both unadjusted and adjusted for key baseline variables) were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Data synthesis: Three randomized trials were included, which tested cholecalciferol, 20 000 IU (500 mcg) weekly; cholecalciferol, 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily; or eldecalcitol, 0.75 mcg daily, versus matching placebos. Trials were at low risk of bias. 

Vitamin D reduced risk for diabetes by 15% (hazard ratio, 0.85 <span>[95% CI, 0.75 to 0.96]</span>) in adjusted analyses, with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (CI, 0.6% to 6.0%). The effect of vitamin D did not differ in prespecified subgroups. 

Among participants assigned to the vitamin D group who maintained an intratrial mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 125 nmol/L (â‰¥50 ng/mL) compared with 50 to 74 nmol/L (20 to 29 ng/mL) during follow-up, cholecalciferol  **reduced risk for diabetes by 76%**  (hazard ratio, 0.24 <span>[CI, 0.16 to 0.36]</span>), with a 3-year absolute risk reduction of 18.1% (CI, 11.7% to 24.6%). 

Vitamin D increased the likelihood of regression to normal glucose regulation by 30% (rate ratio, 1.30 <span>[CI, 1.16 to 1.46]</span>). 

There was no evidence of difference in the rate ratios for adverse events 

* (kidney stones: 1.17 <span>[CI, 0.69 to 1.99]</span>; 

* hypercalcemia: 2.34 <span>[CI, 0.83 to 6.66]</span>; 

* hypercalciuria: 1.65 <span>[CI, 0.83 to 3.28]</span>; 

* death: 0.85 <span>[CI, 0.31 to 2.36]</span>).

Limitations: Studies of people with prediabetes do not apply to the general population. Trials may not have been powered for safety outcomes.

Conclusion: In adults with prediabetes, vitamin D was effective in decreasing risk for diabetes.
