#### Effect of weekly vitamin D supplementation on the severity of atopic dermatitis and type 2 immunity biomarkers in children: A randomized controlled trial

J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol . 2024 Mar 14. [doi: 10.1111/jdv.19959](https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.19959) PDF behind paywall

Background: Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is common among patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and often associated with severity. However, randomized trials of VD supplementation in AD have had equivocal results, and there is little information regarding the effect of VD supplementation on type 2 immunity in AD patients.

Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of VD supplementation to decrease severity of AD and to alter type 2 immunity biomarkers.

Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We randomly assigned 101 children with AD to weekly oral vitamin D3 (VD3) or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the Severity Scoring of AD (SCORAD).

Results: Mean age of subjects was 6.3 ± 4.0 years, and baseline SCORAD was 32 ± 29. At baseline, 57% of children were VD deficient, with no difference between groups. Change in 25(OH)D was significantly greater with VD3 than placebo (+43.4 ± 34.5 nmol/L vs. +2.3 ± 21.2 nmol/L, p < 0.001). SCORAD change at 6 weeks was not different between VD and placebo (-5.3 ± 11.6 vs. -5.5 ± 9.9, p = 0.91). There were no significant between-group differences in change of eosinophil counts, total IgE, Staphylococcal enterotoxin specific IgE, CCL17, CCL22, CCL27, LL-37 or Staphylococcus aureus lesional skin colonization. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms FokI, ApaI and TaqI did not modify subjects' response to VD supplementation.

Conclusions: Among children with AD, weekly VD supplementation improved VD status but did not modify AD severity or type 2 immunity biomarkers compared to placebo (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01996423).
