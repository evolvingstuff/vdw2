Subjects or Study Selection

This systematic review and meta-analysis included studies with patients with moderate to untreated advanced chronic severe periodontitis with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (>2 years). They were recruited from various clinics, including respective hospitals or universities in countries such as Egypt, India, Brazil, and Poland. Exclusion criteria included pregnant women and patients who had antibiotics within the last 3 months before the interventions.

COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that these polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids are used as host-modulating therapy in various chronic inflammatory diseases.1 Several mechanisms have been identified by which omega-3 fatty acids influence various aspects of inflammatory responses mainly via production of eicosanoids, proinflammatory cytokine inhibition and . . . .

Subjects or Study Selection
This systematic review and meta-analysis included studies with patients with moderate to untreated advanced chronic severe periodontitis with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (&gt;2 years). They were recruited from various clinics, including respective hospitals or universities in countries such as Egypt, India, Brazil, and Poland. Exclusion criteria included pregnant women and patients who had antibiotics within the last 3 months before the interventions.

COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that these polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids are used as host-modulating therapy in various chronic inflammatory diseases.1 Several mechanisms have been identified by which omega-3 fatty acids influence various aspects of inflammatory responses mainly via production of eicosanoids, proinflammatory cytokine inhibition and . . . .
