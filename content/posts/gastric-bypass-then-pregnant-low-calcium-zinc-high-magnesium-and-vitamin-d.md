Background: An increased risk of small-for-gestational-age infants after maternal bariatric surgery has been shown. The risk of micronutrients deficiencies in these neonates is unclear.

Objective: To screen for micronutrients deficiencies in newborns of mothers with gastric bypass

Settings: University Hospital in Angers, France

Methods: This study compared the clinical and cord blood biological characteristics of 56 newborns of mothers with prior gastric bypass (RYGB) and 56 newborns of non-obese healthy mothers after normal pregnancy (controls), followed between 01/03/2008 and 31/10/2012. Cord blood micronutrients concentrations from controls were used for establishing normative data. After RYGB, the women took daily micronutrients supplements.

Results: RYGB mothers lost 18.1±6.3 kg/m2 of Body Mass Index (BMI) in the 11-69 months between surgery and pregnancy onset (percentage of excess weight loss 79±20%), reaching BMI of 30.1±6.0 kg/m2 compared with 22.3±4.0 kg/m2 in the controls (p<0.05). 

Neonates born to RYGB mothers were small-for-gestational-age in 23% of cases vs. 3.6% in the control group (p<0.01). 

A higher percentage of RYGB neonates had cord blood concentrations 

 **below the 2.5th percentile for** 

* calcium (19% vs 2%), 

* zinc (13% vs 3%,), 

* iron (19% vs 2%), and 

* vitamin A (13% vs 3%), and 

 **over the 97.5th percentile**  for 

* magnesium (13% vs 3%), 

* vitamin E (16% vs 3%), 

* 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (13% vs 2%), and 

* vitamin B12 (14% vs 2%)(p<0.05 for all comparisons).

Conclusion: Neonates from RYGB mothers showed cord blood micronutrient differences as compared to neonates from healthy mothers. The comparison with neonates from morbidly obese women is still to be done.

Funding: None. The record of medical information as well as the maternal and cord blood analyses were supported by the French national health security system, as part of the usual care.
