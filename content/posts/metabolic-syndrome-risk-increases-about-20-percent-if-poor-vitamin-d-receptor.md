Introduction: Several studies have assessed the association between the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the results were inconsistent and inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the exact association between the vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms and the risk of MetS.

Methods: All accessible studies reporting the association between the FokI (rs2228570) or / and TaqI (rs731236) or/and BsmI (rs1544410) or/and ApaI (rs7975232 polymorphisms of the Vitamin D Receptor and susceptibility to MetS published prior to February 2019 were systematically searched in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. After that, Odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to evaluate the strength of the association in five genetic models.

Results: A total of 9 articles based on four gene variations, and comprising 3348 participants with 1779 metabolic syndrome patients were included. The overall results suggested a significant association between BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism and MetS susceptibility in recessive model (OR, 0.72, 95% CI, 0.55-0.95, fixed effect model), allelic model (OR, 0.83, 95% CI, 0.72-0.95, fixed effect model), and bb vs BB (OR, 0.65, 95% CI, 0.46-0.93, fixed effect). However, no significant association was identified between TaqI (rs731236) polymorphism, ApaI (rs7975232) polymorphism, and FokI (rs2228570) polymorphism and MetS.

Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggested an association between the BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphism and MetS. Indeed, BsmI (rs1544410) acts as a protective factor in the MetS. As a result, the VDR gene could be regarded as a promising pharmacological and physiological target in prevention or treatment of the MetS.
