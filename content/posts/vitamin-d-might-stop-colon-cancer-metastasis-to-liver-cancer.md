Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant health burden worldwide, comprising approximately 10% of annual cancer cases globally. 

Hepatic metastases are the most common site of CRC metastasis, and are the leading cause of death in CRC patients. 

There is strong epidemiologic evidence for an inverse association between vitamin D status and risk of CRC; however, the role of vitamin D in the natural history of liver metastases has not yet been investigated. 

Several researchers have proposed hallmarks of metastases; crucially, metastases can be blocked by interrupting just one rate-limiting step. 

 **Vitamin D status has been implicated in each proposed hallmark of metastasis.** 

The aim of this review is to examine the potential role for vitamin D in reducing the development of hepatic metastases from CRC and outline the candidate mechanisms by which vitamin D may mediate these effects. The results of ongoing randomised intervention trials are eagerly awaited to determine whether addressing vitamin D insufficiency in CRC patients could reduce the occurrence of liver metastases, and the consequent morbidity and mortality.
