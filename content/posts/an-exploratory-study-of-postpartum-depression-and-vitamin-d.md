BACKGROUND: Low levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D), a reliable measurement of vitamin D, have been implicated in several mood disorders. To date, studies exploring the relationship between vitamin D and postpartum depression are absent from the literature. 

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a relationship exists between symptoms associated with postpartum depression and vitamin D levels and to determine if serum 25(OH) D levels can predict the incidence of symptoms associated with postpartum depression. 

STUDY DESIGN: An exploratory, descriptive study using a convenience sample of 97 postpartum women attending seven monthly visits. Women provided serum 25(OH)D samples and completed the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at each visit. 

RESULTS: A significant relationship over time was found between low 25(OH)D levels and high EPDS scores, indicative of postpartum depression. 

CONCLUSIONS: Future rigorous studies investigating vitamin D and postpartum depression are warranted with larger sample sizes using confirmatory methods to diagnose postpartum depression. 10.1177/1078390310370476

### Depression dropped off more quickly in those women with more vitamin D

This integrative review evaluates research studies that investigated the association between vitamin D and mood disorders affecting women to determine whether further research comparing these variables is warranted. A literature search using CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases was conducted to locate peer-reviewed mood disorder research studies that measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels.  **Four of six studies reviewed imparted significant results,**  with all four showing an association between low 25(OH)D levels and higher incidences of four mood disorders: premenstrual syndrome, seasonal affective disorder, non-specified mood disorder, and major depressive disorder. This review indicates a possible biochemical mechanism occurring between vitamin D and mood disorders affecting women, warranting further studies of these variables using rigorous methodologies.
