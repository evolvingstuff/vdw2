# Vitamin D interventions can quickly benefit the HMO bottom line

^Notes to reviewers

The following material is aimed at a CEO at a large HMO, probably CEO @ Kaiser in the US, who has an MBA, not a medical degree

READERS: Initially it will be read by many medical and non-medical people, first outside of the HMO, then later inside of the HMO

LENGTH: long enough to be convincing/believable, but short enough to be understood in a few minutes.

PRIMARY FOCUS: Understand how money can be saved very quickly, probably within 2 months. 

SECONDARY FOCUS: Medical proof that vitamin D does reduce medical costs

ACTION DESIRED: CEO requests that the medical staff confirm that vitamin D will help the HMO bottom line.

## Premise: HMOs will save millions of dollars by adding vitamin D before and after many procedures

Vitamin D improves health. 

Health Maintenance Organizations get paid a fixed amount per person per year. 

When the person uses the HMO less during a year the HMO effectively earns money (actually does not have to pay money)

- - - - - - - - - - - 

# Want the HMO to take baby steps initially

&nbsp; &nbsp; Something they can try and get instant positive feedback - at low risk

## Vitamin D aspects as Low Hanging fruit

Later, after seeing how good the low hanging fruit is, the HMO can become aware of:

1. fruit higher up the same tree,

1. other trees,

1. the benefits of planning ahead (pruning, fertilizer, etc)

1. things the HMO can cultivate which are not trees (Preventive Medicine:  Kaiser Permanente==> Kaiser Preventive?)

## How vitamin D can initially benefit the HMO:

Helps heal faster (especially bones) - thus fewer days that HMO has to pay for hospital/ physical therapy faster

Reduces complications from pregnancy, surgery- fewer days

Reduces problems with some drugs, chemotherapy, radiation therapy

Improves immune system - reduces secondary problems - Staph. MRSA

Reduces time in ICU/critical care

## Contra-indications: when not to take vitamin D

Interaction with drugs

Interaction with chemotherapy - increasing effectiveness perhaps to the point of death

Hypercalcimia

## Why add vitamin D now

Lots of recent research supports it (see below)

Inevitable that vitamin will be used before/after some medical procedures - typically surgeries

First organization to have vitamin D intervention will save huge amounts of money, then others will follow.

## What are the malpractice considerations?

It might be [ **malpractice to not recommend**  more vitamin D](/tags/malpractice-to-not-recommend-more-vitamin-d.html) now - and not get sued until years in the future

 **Perhaps the risk is highest are to those which do NOT recommend vitamin D.** 

Probably want to avoid promising the patient any results from taking the vitamin D - reduces the probability of a malpractice suit

## A first-cut at ROI

The total costs associated with a procedure = $700

&nbsp; &nbsp;Specialist's time: 1/2 hour = $170; Staff time      3 hours = $300; Blood Tests =  $200; Supplements  $30

 **Rough Estimate of the Benefits to the Bottom line = ROI = 3.3X** 

IF could save two days for every intervention, then would save $1500 X 2 - $700 (cost of intervention) = $2300

Return On Investment for this example = $2300/700 = 3.3x

Probably the average savings due to reduced healing time and complications across all interventions will be much smaller

&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: this does not account for the development of the protocol - described below

## Actions that an HMO can take to get these savings

## Possible medical interventions to choose from: all of which have been significantly helped with vitamin D

## What might be the concerns of the HMO upper management?

$$: supplies, personnel, payments from Medicare, advertising, ....

Number of participants leaving, or decreasing number of new participants

The need to expand: additional facilities if no change is made, etc,

Ability to bring in more patients when fee-for-service doctors are reluctant to increase vitamin D 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vitamin D decreases the income of a fee-for service practice

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vitamin D keeps the HMO income the same, but decreases the outgo

## Portion of comment by Rich B.

The biggest concern to HMO management is that many doctors will consider vitamin D clinical results to be unproven, based on flimsy anecdotal evidence.  

The HMO needs to take the approach that:

* The evidence is strong enough, 

* The risks are low enough,

* The cost is cheap enough 

so that the cost-benefit ratio points in the direction of radical vitamin D supplementation. 

If you wait until the supporting evidence is bulletproof, you are going to waste billions of dollars in the interim, and there is even a chance the evidence will never gain the status of irrefutable truth.  It is somewhat like the evidence indicating the dangers of smoking, or the evidence of the dangers of not washing hands after doing autopsies and then delivering babies (Semmelweis).

## Hopefully the medical community will not delay for decades as it did in the past for other supplements: Iodine, scurvy, rickets

---

## An idea for a long-term additional method for a HMO to discover the benefits of vitamin D intervention

Similar to [Fraser Health](/tags/fraser-health.html), or Finland decades ago, offer say 4,000 IU of vitamin D daily to a subset of the HMO clients

&nbsp; &nbsp; Say to clients which doctor is willing to go-along with the intervention

Benefits will be seen over many months, years

ROI might actually be higher than mentioned above due to the far lower costs

A Random Controlled Trial would be nice to get proof, but would be unethical and could increase liability

Could alternately track the reduced health needs at one hospital with intervention vs another without intervention

Provide vitamin D in a variety of [forms](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=52&sort_mode=created_desc) (capsule, liquid, sub-lingual, [Vegan](/tags/vegan.html), Kosher, ...)

To increase compliance - might suggest 50,000 IU capsules to be taken once every 2 weeks (mark-off calendar when taken so as to not forget)

Provide variety of patient education modes for vitamin D and co-factors (web, class, printed, ...)

Less than 4,000 IU if person is already taking some vitamin D or is younger than 9 years old

Initial benefits should be first noticed by the HMO in about 2 months (colds, flu, aches, pains, ...)

Blood tests: recommended by optional 3 months after starting the intervention - primarily testing for things other than vitamin D (PTH, Magnesium, . . . )

Substantial benefits will be well documented in about a year

---

## At some point want to suggest to the group getting the cost savings that 10% of documented net savings be given to vitamin D non-profits

- - - -so as to expand awareness, and bring even more people (and doctors?) into the HMO

Non-profits such as Vitamin D Wiki, Vitamin D Council, Vitamin D Association (UK)

### Cost of Health Care about $10,000 per year: HMO or otherwise

### HMO types: Staff, Group, Network

from [WikiPedia - June 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_maintenance_organization)

HMOs operate in a variety of forms. Most HMOs today do not fit neatly into one form; they can have multiple divisions, each operating under a different model, or blend two or more models together. 

In the  **staff model** , physicians are salaried and have offices in HMO buildings. In this case, physicians are direct employees of the HMOs. This model is an example of a closed-panel HMO, meaning that contracted physicians may only see HMO patients. Previously this type of HMO was common, although currently it is nearly inactive.<sup>[5]</sup>

In the  **group model** , the HMO does not employ the physicians directly, but contracts with a multi-specialty physician group practice. Individual physicians are employed by the group practice, rather than by the HMO. The group practice may be established by the HMO and only serve HMO members ("captive group model"). Kaiser Permanente is an example of a captive group model HMO rather than a staff model HMO, as is commonly believed. An HMO may also contract with an existing, independent group practice ("independent group model"), which will generally continue to treat non-HMO patients. Group model HMOs are also considered closed-panel, because doctors must be part of the group practice to participate in the HMO - the HMO panel is closed to other physicians in the community.<sup>[6]</sup>

If not already part of a group medical practice, physicians may contract with an independent practice association (IPA), which in turn contracts with the HMO. 

This model is an example of an open-panel HMO, where a physician may maintain their own office and may see non-HMO members.

In the  **network model,**  an HMO will contract with any combination of groups, IPAs (Independent Practice Associations), and individual physicians. 

Since 1990, most HMOs run by managed care organizations with other lines of business (such as PPO, POS and indemnity) use the network model.
