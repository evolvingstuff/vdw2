BACKGROUND:

Maternal vitamin D status during fetal development may influence offspring growth and risk of obesity; however, evidence in humans is limited.

OBJECTIVE:

To investigate whether maternal circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) concentration in pregnancy is associated with offspring prenatal and postnatal growth and overweight.

METHODS:

Plasma 25(OH)D3 concentration was measured in pregnant women (median weeks of gestation 14.0, range 13.0-15.0) from the INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) cohort (Spain, 2003-2008) (n = 2358). Offspring femur length (FL), biparietal diameter (BPD),  **abdominal circumference (AC)**  and estimated fetal weight (EFW) were evaluated at 12, 20 and 34 weeks of gestation by ultrasound examinations. Fetal overweight was defined either as AC or as EFW ⩾ 90th percentile. Child's anthropometry was recorded at ages 1 and 4 years. Rapid growth was defined as a weight gain z-score of >0.67 from birth to ages 6 months and 1 year. Age- and sex-specific z-scores for body mass index (BMI) were calculated at ages 1 and 4 years (World Health Organization referent); infant's overweight was defined as a BMI z-score ⩾ 85th percentile.

RESULTS:

We found no association of maternal 25(OH)D3 concentration with FL and a weak inverse association with BPD at 34 weeks. Maternal deficit of 25(OH)D3 (<20 ng ml(-1)) was associated with increased risk of fetal overweight defined as  **AC ⩾ 90th percentile (odds ratio (OR) = 1.50,** 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.21; P = 0.041) or either as EFW ⩾ 90th percentile (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.00-2.16; P = 0.046). No significant associations were found with rapid growth. Deficit of 25(OH)D3 in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of overweight in offspring at age 1 year (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.02-1.97; P = 0.039); however, the association was attenuated at age 4 years (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.83-1.72; P = 0.341).

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy may increase the risk of prenatal and early postnatal overweight in offspring. Clinical trials are warranted to determine the role of vitamin D in the early origins of obesity.
