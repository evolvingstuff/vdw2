Melanoma, a prevalent and lethal form of skin cancer, remains a formidable challenge in terms of prevention and treatment. While significant progress has been made in understanding its pathogenesis and treatment, the quest for effective prevention strategies and therapeutic approaches remains ongoing. Considering the increased advancements in understanding the dynamic interplay between nutrients and melanoma, we aim to offer a refreshed perspective on nutrient-based approaches for melanoma prevention and adjunctive therapy. In contrast to other studies, we have innovatively provided a detailed exposition of the nutrients’ influences on melanoma prognosis and treatment. 

This review firstly examines various nutrients, including 

* antioxidants (namely vitamins A, D, C, and E; selenium; and caffeine), 

* polyunsaturated fatty acids, and flavonoids, 

for their effects and underlying mechanisms in reducing melanoma risk. 

Among these nutrients, caffeine shows the most promising potential, as it is supported by multiple cohort studies for its protective effect against melanoma. In contrast, there is a certain degree of inconsistency in the research of other nutrients, possibly due to inherent differences between animal studies and epidemiological research, as well as variations in the definition of nutrient intake. To comprehensively investigate the impact of nutrients on melanoma progression and therapeutic approaches, the following sections will explore how nutrients influence immune responses and other physiological processes. 

While there is robust support from cell and animal studies regarding the immunomodulatory attributes of  **vitamins D and zinc** , the anti-angiogenic potential of polyphenols, and the cell growth-inhibitory effects of flavonoids, the limited availability of human-based research substantially constrains their practical relevance in clinical contexts. 

As for utilizing nutrients in adjuvant melanoma treatments, multiple approaches have garnered clinical research support, including the utilization of vitamin D to decrease the postoperative recurrence rates among melanoma patients and the adoption of a high-fiber diet to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. In general, the effects of most nutrients on reducing the risk of melanoma are not entirely clear. However, several nutrients, including vitamin D and dietary fiber, have demonstrated their potential to improve the melanoma prognosis and enhance the treatment outcomes, making them particularly deserving of clinical attention. A personalized and interdisciplinary approach, involving dermatologists, oncologists, nutritionists, and researchers, holds the promise of optimizing melanoma treatment strategies.
