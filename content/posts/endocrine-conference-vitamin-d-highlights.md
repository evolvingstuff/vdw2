<span style="color:#00F;">"Conclusion: The current practice of assessing vitamin D in pregnancy consists of measurement of 25OH-D. However, 25OH-D as an indicator of sufficiency does not correlate well with calcium homeostasis markers in pregnancy. Calcitriol correlates better with PTH and CTX in pregnancy. It appears that bioavailable and free fractions of calcitriol are the best markers for determining vitamin D status in pregnant women."</span>   

 **OR45-4: Incidence of Hypercalciuria and Hypercalcemia during Vitamin D and Calcium Supplementation in Older and Younger Women: A Comparison Between Caucasians and African Americans in Two Randomized Trials** 

Sri Harsha Tella, MD, Department of Internal Medicine/Endocrinology, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE, J Christopher Gallagher, MD, Dept of Endo, Creighton University Medical Cen, Omaha, NE, Shervin Yousefian, MD, Department of Endocrinology, Creighton University and Vinod Yalamanchili, Department of Internal Medicine, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE

"CONCLUSION: The risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria are higher in Caucasian women compared to African Americans and higher in older women. The risk is not related to the vitamin D dose, serum 25OHD level, calcium absorption or bone resorption. Even in the placebo group on a total daily calcium intake of 1200 or 1000 mg there is an increased risk of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria; thus,  **even a modest calcium supplementation of 350 in young or 600mg/day in older women may be too high** ."
