#### Why Collagen Is a Proven Necessity - [Mercola Sept 2023](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2023/09/04/why-collagen-is-a-proven-necessity.aspx?ui=d738e3df52a8a14aea9298fe6ec5bc113ed0d6d7922f31861727d54a43cbe29d&sd=20121119&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20230904&foDate=false&mid=DM1459708&rid=1902035015)

* Collagen is the most common and abundant of your body’s proteins, accounting for about 30% of the total protein in your body. One of its primary purposes is to provide structural scaffolding to allow tissues to stretch and flex while maintaining tissue integrity

* Collagen is found in your skin, connective tissues like tendons, ligaments, cartilage and fascia, your bones, organs, blood vessels, musculoskeletal system, hair and nails

* The loss of collagen that occurs with age is the primary reason for wrinkles, dry sagging skin and lackluster hair. You can maintain a more youthful appearance by making sure you’re getting plenty of collagen and/or gelatin in your diet

* Collagen is also crucial for bone health and recovery from soft tissue injuries, and can help improve sleep, reduce joint pain, improve gut health, glucose tolerance and blood pressure, reduce cardiovascular damage, lower your risk of osteoporosis, and lower inflammation and oxidative damage

* The primary amino acids in collagen — glycine, proline and hydroxyproline — make up the matrix of connective tissue. Beef contains very little of these amino acids, so eating only muscle meat will not provide enough amino acids to allow you to build strong connective tissue and maintain bone strength

#### 9 grams oral collagen increased skin elasticity by ~ 50% - RCT March 2019

 **Topical application and oral supplementation of peptides in the improvement of skin viscoelasticity and density**

BACKGROUND:

The combination of oral supplementation and topical formulations to the improvement of skin conditions has been proposed as an innovative approach to obtain effective treatments. However, studies comparing the effectiveness of each type of treatments are still in lack. This way, the objective of this work was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a dermocosmetic formulation with di- and tripeptides, as well the effects of an oral supplementation based on hydrolyzed collagen through biophysical and skin imaging techniques.

METHODS:

Sixty healthy female subjects, aged between 40 and 50 years, were enrolled, being separated in 3 groups: topical formulation, oral supplementation, and oral placebo. The stratum corneum water content, skin viscoelasticity, dermis echogenicity, and skin pores parameters were evaluated.

RESULTS:

The group with the topical formulation showed a significant increase in the stratum corneum water content and skin elasticity after 28-day period and also acted in the dermis echogenicity after 90 days with the formulation with peptides. The oral supplementation acted on skin elasticity and presented a more pronounced effect on dermis echogenicity, reducing skin pores after 90-day period.

CONCLUSION: The obtained results with oral supplementation and topical application of hydrolyzed proteins were considered complementary in the improvement of general skin conditions, acting in different mechanisms.

#### Oral Collagen helps skin - review Jan 2019

 **Oral Collagen Supplementation: A Systematic Review of Dermatological Applications** 

J Drugs Dermatol. 2019 Jan 1;18(1):9-16.

Choi FD, Sung CT, Juhasz ML, Mesinkovsk NA.

IMPORTANCE:

The use of nutraceuticals such as collagen for skincare has been rising, but regulations are lacking on quality, absorption, and efficacy. To address this knowledge gap, clinical studies regarding the potential effects of collagen-based dietary supplements on skin are being completed.

OBJECTIVE:

To review the literature and assess available randomized-controlled trials using collagen supplementation for treatment efficacy regarding skin quality, anti-aging benefits, and potential application in medical dermatology.

EVIDENCE REVIEW:

A literature search was conducted with PubMed using search criteria (collagen) AND (supplement OR food OR nutrition). No lower limit on the year of publication was set. Inclusion criteria were: randomized, placebo-controlled trials using collagen supplementation in human subjects related to dermatology and written in English.

FINDINGS:

Eleven studies with a total of 805 patients were included for review. Eight studies used collagen hydrolysate, 2.5g/d to 10g/d, for 8 to 24 weeks, for the treatment of pressure ulcers, xerosis, skin aging, and cellulite. Two studies used collagen tripeptide, 3g/d for 4 to 12 weeks, with notable improvement in skin elasticity and hydration. Lastly, one study using collagen dipeptide suggested anti-aging efficacy is proportionate to collagen dipeptide content.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

Preliminary results are promising for the short and long-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging.  **Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density.**  Collagen supplementation is generally safe with no reported adverse events. Further studies are needed to elucidate medical use in skin barrier diseases such as atopic dermatitis and to determine optimal dosing regimens.

#### 5 grams oral collagen helped skin - RCT 2015

 **Oral supplementation of specific collagen peptides has beneficial effects on human skin physiology: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.** 

Skin Pharmacol Physiol. 2014;27(1):47-55. [doi: 10.1159/000351376.](https://doi.org/10.1159/000351376.) Epub 2013 Aug 14.

Proksch E1, Segger D, Degwert J, Schunck M, Zague V, Oesser S.

Various dietary supplements are claimed to have cutaneous anti-aging properties; however, there are a limited number of research studies supporting these claims. The objective of this research was to study the effectiveness of collagen hydrolysate (CH) composed of specific collagen peptides on skin biophysical parameters related to cutaneous aging. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 69 women aged 35-55 years were randomized to receive 2.5 g or 5.0 g of CH or placebo once daily for 8 weeks, with 23 subjects being allocated to each treatment group. Skin elasticity, skin moisture, transepidermal water loss and skin roughness were objectively measured before the first oral product application (t0) and after 4 (t1) and 8 weeks (t2) of regular intake. Skin elasticity (primary interest) was also assessed at follow-up 4 weeks after the last intake of CH (t3, 4-week regression phase). At the end of the study, skin elasticity in both CH dosage groups showed a statistically significant improvement in comparison to placebo. After 4 weeks of follow-up treatment, a statistically significantly higher skin elasticity level was determined in elderly women. With regard to skin moisture and skin evaporation, a positive influence of CH treatment could be observed in a subgroup analysis, but data failed to reach a level of statistical significance. No side effects were noted throughout the

study.

#### How to Get More Collagen, and Why Your Skin Needs It to Stay Young

 **[Bulletproof](https://blog.bulletproof.com/collagen-peptides-benefits-3c/) 26 references** 

* Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, and gives structure to your skin, bones, muscles, and all other connective tissue.

* Your body produces less of it as you get older, which results in fine lines and wrinkles.

* Taking collagen orally can improve skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and increase skin moisture.

* Collagen peptides have other benefits including strengthening joints, improving sleep, and accelerating weight loss.

* To boost your collagen stores, eat foods like bone broth and stir collagen peptides powder into your smoothie or Bulletproof Coffee. Skin procedures like LED light therapy and micro-needling also stimulate it.

#### The most abundant protein in mammals- Wikipedia 2019

 **[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen)** 

* As the main component of connective tissue, it is the most abundant protein in mammals,<sup>[1]</sup> making 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content

* Depending upon the degree of mineralization, collagen tissues may be rigid (bone), compliant (tendon), or have a gradient from rigid to compliant (cartilage). It is also abundant in corneas, blood vessels, the gut, intervertebral discs, and the dentin in teeth
