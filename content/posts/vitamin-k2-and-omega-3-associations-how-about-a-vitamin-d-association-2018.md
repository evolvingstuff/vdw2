 **A new single ingredient trade association has formed to push the quality and benefits of vitamin K2.** 

 **Snips from Nutagredients press release** 

The Vitamin K2 Association launched with Norwegian firm  **Kappa Bioscience**  taking the role of founding executive board member. Other founding members include  **Vesta Ingredients, Xsto Solutions, Nutrasource Diagnostics and Flora Research Laboratories** .

Vitamin K2 is the menaquinone 7 form of the vitamin whose bioactivity in certain indications such as bone health and arterial health is supported by specific research. It is found in naturally fermented foods such as cheese and natto, a fermented soybean paste. A number of companies, including Kappa’s Norwegian competitor Nattopharma, have pioneered the bacterial fermentation of the ingredient.

 **[K2 association](/tags/k2-association.html)**   501(c)(6) not-for-profit trade association

Questions of quality and identity often swirl around new ingredient categories. Depending on the individual parameters (which microorganisms are used, what the intermediate processing steps might be, etc.) fermentation processes can give rise to significant differences in the final ingredient in terms of strength and purity. Can the players agree on basic specifications?

The founding of the  **Global Organization of EPA and DHA Omega 3s (GOED)**  is the model for all such single ingredient associations. One of GOED’s first orders of business was to agree upon a monograph specifying what the minimum specifications for omega-3s products ought to be.

Note [GOED](http://www.goedomega3.com/) is also a non-profit trade association
