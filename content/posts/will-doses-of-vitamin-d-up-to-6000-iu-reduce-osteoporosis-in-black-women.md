## Purpose
 |
| Vitamin D is a  hormone that is produced when sunlight is absorbed by the skin.  Vitamin  D insufficiency has been recognized as a problem in areas where sun  exposure is limited, especially in the wintertime.  In addition, the  more pigmented the skin is, the less capable it is of utilizing sunlight  to make vitamin D.  Vitamin D plays an important role in helping the  body absorb calcium and in building strong bones.  It has also been  shown to improve muscle function in the elderly.  As we get older, our  vitamin D levels in the blood go down and this may increase the risk for  falls and fractures.  If we can improve vitamin D status as we age, we  may be able to improve muscle strength and decrease the risk of falls  and fractures. |

## Detailed Description:

The long-term goal  of this project is to develop strategies for the prevention of  osteoporotic fractures in African Americans.  Most intervention studies  have excluded African Americans because of the erroneous belief that  osteoporosis is not a major health problem in this population.  In fact,  the incidence rate of hip fracture in blacks is 50% of the rate in  whites.  Since longevity is increasing in the black population,  osteoporotic fractures will become an even greater problem for this  ethnic minority in the future.  Furthermore, morbidity and mortality  from osteoporotic fractures is greater in blacks.  The elderly require  higher intake of vitamin D to prevent bone loss resulting from secondary  hyperparathyroidism.  Calcium with sufficient vitamin D supplementation  may decrease fractures in elderly white populations as a result of  reduction in bone loss and falls (improved physical performance).  The  only fracture intervention study to include African Americans—the  Women's Health Initiative—used an inadequate dose of vitamin D (400 IU),  a dose unlikely to achieve the vitamin D status proposed by U.S.  experts: serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration above 75  nmol/L.  No calcium/vitamin D intervention studies on fall prevention or  physical performance have included African Americans.

As a result of increased skin  pigmentation, blacks synthesize less vitamin D from sun exposure.  As a  result, serum 25(OH)D levels are often in the "insufficient" range.   This is accompanied by secondary hyperparathyroidism, but adult blacks  have a relative skeletal resistance to PTH, so that they have lower bone  turnover.  They also have more efficient renal conservation of calcium  starting in childhood.  Addition of vitamin D3 to a calcium-sufficient  African American postmenopausal population does not prevent bone loss.   The calcium/vitamin D requirements of black adults may be lower than  white adults through midlife.  However, the elderly require more vitamin  D to produce the higher 25(OH)D levels required to overcome the  hyperparathyroidism associated with aging.  The skeleton of elderly  African Americans appears to be susceptible to the increasing  parathyroid hormone levels of old age.  Bone loss accelerates and bone  turnover markers increase in elderly African Americans just as in  whites.  The specific aims of this project are to determine if dietary  supplementation with calcium/vitamin D will safely reduce bone loss and  bone turnover and improve physical performance in elderly African  Americans.  We will enroll 250 African American women in a four-year  vitamin D3 intervention trial where serum 25(OH)D will be maintained at  an optimum level above 75 nmol/L.  Adequate calcium intake will be  ensured.  Functional markers of vitamin D including bone density, serum  PTH, and bone turnover will be measured. The NIH Conference on Vitamin D  and Health in the 21st Century, September 5-6, 2007 concluded that  research in this population is a high priority.

1. Moderate to severe fracture in one or  more vertebrae by Instant Vertebral Assessment on DXA.

1. Treatment with HRT, SERMS, calcitonin,  PTH, androgens, bisphosphonates, phosphate or anabolic steroids during 6  months prior to entry.

1. Use of systemic corticosteroids (oral or  IV) within the last year at an average dose of greater than 5 mg per day  of oral prednisone or equivalent for a period of three months or more  prior to screening.

1. Significant deviation from normal in  either: history, physical examination or laboratory tests as evaluated  by the Principle Investigator.  Participants with a history of  hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis and active sarcoidosis will also be  excluded.

1. Participation in another investigational  trial 30 days prior to screening.

1. Spinal disease that affects  interpretation of bone densitometry like scoliosis with a Cobb angle  greater than 15o, history of surgery at lumbosacral spine.
