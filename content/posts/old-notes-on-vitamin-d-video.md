### [Main webpage for Vitamin D Video](/tags/main-webpage-for-vitamin-d-video.html)

## Audience characterizations

Age 40+ (of either sex, of any skin color, of any weight, etc)

Believes that they can do something to improve their health/wellness (he is not getting all nutritional information just from a doctor)

Probably already taking 1 or more supplements

Probably has some current ache/pain

May have a current disease which they want to treat

May have a specific health concern - such as Alzheimer's, Cancer, falling, hypertension, 

May be aware that they are at high risk of being vitamin D deficient (such as: dark skin, senior, obese, pregnant, etc)

Probably has heard about vitamin D before

May be concerned that vitamin D is being overhyped : like previous vitamins, wonderdrugs

Interest may be for self, children, **aging parents,**  friends

Probably can understand English - but the video will have captions in 5 other languages

Can afford $10 to confirm that Vitamin D provides a noticeable benefit

Prefer fast feedback â€“ not typically willing to wait for years to feel any benefit, will have to wait 1 or 2 months for vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not as fast of aspirin reducing headache, but far faster than aspirin reducing cancer or heart attack.

 **Perhaps the top points to be made/remembered** 

1. You are no longer getting enough sun (see below)

1. Sun produces vitamin D via your skin (perhaps use idea from Sunlight Institute - below)

1. Vitamin D keeps your body healthy (perhaps use idea from Sunlight Institute - below)

1. Need to  **restore**  vitamin D levels - more time in the sun, or low cost Vitamin D3 (if only take a single supplement, it should be vitamin D)

1. How much vitamin D (include idea of high risk groups: (dark skin, seniors, obese, pregnant,  .)  

1. How soon you will feel the benefits (1 month if quickly restore levels, otherwise 3 months)

## Potential story to include: Proof that adding vitamin D prevents/treats

Proved by [Many Random Controlled Trials](/tags/many-random-controlled-trials.html) 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;which gives vitamin D to one half and a placebo to the other half, and see what happens

[Rickets reduced 6000% by adding 400 IU vitamin D to infants for an entire country](/tags/rickets-reduced-6000-by-adding-400-iu-vitamin-d-to-infants-for-an-entire-country.html) not a Random Controlled Trial

[Back pain reduced by vitamin D in "only 97%" of the patients](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1348) (file) not a Random Controlled Trial

## More notes

Expect that it will be linked to by a wide variety of web sites, such as:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;vitamin D, diseases (e.g.breast cancer), employers, Health Maintenance Organizations, senior groups (e.g. AARP)

Minimize the use of VitaminDWiki name, or any specific product (people reject advertisements)

Marketing will be included - such as with social media marketing by https://www.thunderclap.it/

The version of the video should take very little bandwidth - such that virtually anyone can view it without its pausing.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;YouTube is the primary target for this video, but we might, in addition, host it some other place which provides low bandwidth viewing (with FLASH)

Since most people know how to pause a video, can use detailed graphics if it can work at two levels: 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;quick first view, then read the details while paused in a later viewing

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;example diseases prevented/treated by Vitamin D: perhaps shown on the body

 **Cofactors** : would like to spend a few seconds describing the need for cofactors to balance any vitamin D doses > 3500 IU

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mg, Ca, Vitamin K-2, etc  cofactors also help bones, teeth, hair, and naisl

#### Length of viral videos

Viral videos tend to be 1 to 5 minutes in length.  Length varies a lot.

Educational viral videos are typically 14 minutes in length - much longer
