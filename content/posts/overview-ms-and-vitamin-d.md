#### MS and Vitamin D Overview

<!-- ~tc~ start ~/tc~ -->

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Clinical interventions have shown that Vitamin D can prevent, treat, and even cure Multiple Sclerosis,  at a tiny fraction of the cost of the drugs now used to treat it, and without side effects.</span>** 

*  **Fact:**  Low Vitamin D  results in higher risk of getting MS

> Increase latitude leads to decreased Vitamin D, which leads to increased risk of MS

> <img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

> <img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

> [Dark skinned people are far more likely to get MS](/tags/dark-skinned-people-are-far-more-likely-to-get-ms.html) (dark skin people typically have low vitamin D) 

> Elderly  (who typically have low vitamin D)  are more likely to get MS

> Is there increased risk in people who already have diseases associated with low vitamin D - TB, for example ? ? ?

> Women typically have 3X increased MS risk  then men (note: women typically have 20% lower levels of vitamin D than men)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Exception: women in very sunny climates and dark-skinned women have the same MS risk as men 

> Obese [are 60% more likely to get MS](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19169174)

> [Multiple Sclerosis 42X more likely if light brown skin and smoke (both associated with low vitamin D) – July 2020](/posts/multiple-sclerosis-42x-more-likely-if-light-brown-skin-and-smoke-both-associated-with-low-vitamin-d)

> MS recurrence is much higher in spring - the lowest time of the year for vitamin D  

> increase in clouds/rainfall (which reduces available Vitamin D) is associated with increased risk of MS (Scotland, Western Washington)

> [MS incidence has increased 70% in a decade](/posts/incidence-of-22-health-problems-related-to-vitamin-d-have-doubled-in-a-decade) while the incidence of vitamin D deficiency doubled

> [Less MS in those with outdoor occupations](www.VitaminDWiki.com/dl1188) PDF file, not a web page 

*  **Fact:**  MS uses up Vitamin D

*  **Fact:**  Lower vitamin D (due to MS using up Vitamin D while fighting the disease) results in many other health problems (such as broken bones), so depleted vitamin D levels must be restored.

> <img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

*  **Fact:**   Vitamin D looks so promising for preventing and treating MS that there were [25 INTERVENTION clinical trials as of Feb 2014](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=%22multiple+sclerosis%22+&recr=&rslt=&type=&cond=&intr=%22vitamin+d%22&outc=&spons=&lead=&id=&state1=&cntry1=&state2=&cntry2=&state3=&cntry3=&locn=&gndr=&rcv_s=&rcv_e=&lup_s=&lup_e=)

*  **Fact:**  Vitamin D reduced the MS relapse rate [far better than Fingolimod](/posts/vitamin-d-far-better-than-fingolimod-in-reducing-ms-relapse-rate)  which is now used for that purpose.

   * Note: [Fingolimod costs $25,000/year](http://www.ajmc.com/publications/ajpb/2011/AJPB_NovDec2011/Cost-Effectiveness-of-Fingolimod-in-Treating-Patients-with-Relapsing-Remitting-Multiple-Sclerosis) while vitamin D, which works better and has no side effects is  1000 times less expensive.

*  **Fact:**  [98% of the genes affected by  Interferon are also affected by Vitamin D](/posts/98-pcnt-of-genes-that-vitamin-d-activates-to-reduce-ms-are-also-activated-by-interferon) 

   * Note: 1 week  of Interferon = $4,700, 1 week of vitamin D 10,000X lower cost

*  **Fact:**  MS Doctors in [Brazil recommending 40-100 ng/mL of Vitamin D](/posts/ms-and-vitamin-d-consensus-from-brazil-40-100-ng-not-monotherapy)

*  **Fact:**   Many MS forums are recommending vitamin D to treat MS, with some [taking 5,000 to 10,000 IU daily](http://www.msworld.org/forum/showthread.php?t=103191)

> Observation: [Risk of going from pre-MS to MS reduced 68 percent with 7100 IU vitamin D – RCT Dec 2012](/posts/risk-of-going-from-pre-ms-to-ms-reduced-68-percent-with-7100-iu-vitamin-d-rct)

   * This is an observation instead of a fact - it has not yet been confirmed.

*  **Fact:**   [VERY LARGE doses of vitamin D have CURED 2,000 people of MS in Brazil](/tags/very-large-doses-of-vitamin-d-have-cured-2000-people-of-ms-in-brazil.html)

*  **Controversy:**  [UVB fron sunlight or UVB bulb may be BETTER than Vitamin D for reducing the  risk of getting MS](/tags/uvb-fron-sunlight-or-uvb-bulb-may-be-better-than-vitamin-d-for-reducing-the-risk-of-getting-ms.html)

*  **Hypothesis:**  In addition to Vitamin D there are many other photoproducts produced by UVB that may promote health.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Summary: lack of consensus on how much to prevent, treat, or cure MS.</span>**

* [How much Vitamin D to prevent many diseases - such as MS](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

*  **How much Vitamin D is needed to treat MS?**  There is currently no agreement 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; The recommendations range from 40 to 100 ng - which can result of a dose ranging from 3,000 to 20,000 IU/day

*  **How Vitamin D is needed to Cure MS?** : It appears that 20,000-140,000 IU daily may be needed to CURE the disease

> &nbsp; &nbsp; You must be under the supervision of a doctor who knows what to watch for in your individual situation.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; High doses of Vitamin D cannot be used as a monotherapy. 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; You will need to adjust the cofactors: Typically increasing Magnesium and Vitamin K2, and reducing Calcium intake.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Your doctor will monitor these and might increase your intake of Vitamins B2, C, as well as Omega-3

#### Genes, MS, and Vitamin D

 **FACT:**  At least some MS is associated with a gene variant

 **FACT:**  People with MS need higher levels of vitamin D to treat the symptoms

 **SPECULATION:**  Those people with the gene variant need higher levels of vitamin D in the blood to prevent/treat MS

* [Multiple Sclerosis (MS) malady](http://www.malacards.org/card/multiple_sclerosis?search=%22vitamin+d%22) Malacards has the following graphic

 **Top 20 diseases related by genes to MS ( many of which are associated with low vitamin D)**

#### Low D leads to MS which further lowers vitamin D
