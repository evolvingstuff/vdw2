 **What is Known:** 

* Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in pediatrics.

* Several studies reported a negative association between low serum vitamin D level and grades of NAFLD. 

 **What is New:** 

* Vitamin D supplementation has significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation and improved the grades of NAFLD in children, confirmed by liver biopsy, but no effect on hepatocyte ballooning or fibrosis was observed. 

* Adjuvant vitamin D supplementation is recommended in children with NAFLD.

Vitamin D is reported to have anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, yet vitamin D effects on hepatic fat content in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are not studied sufficiently. We aimed to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation on the hepatic fat content and NAFLD progression in children. This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on 109 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD; only 100 patients completed the study. 

Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the treatment group who received 2000 IU/day vitamin D for 6 months and the control group who received a placebo. Anthropometric measurements, vitamin D levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), serum triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin level (FBI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and serum calcium level were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. 

Liver biopsy was taken before and at the end of the study for all included children. There was a significant improvement of the hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation by liver biopsy in the treatment group after treatment. However, there was no significant effect on the hepatocyte ballooning or hepatic fibrosis. There were significant decrease of AST, ALT, TG, LDL, FBG, FBI, and HOMA-IR and significant increase of vitamin D levels and HDL in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05).

Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation was found to be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD in children
