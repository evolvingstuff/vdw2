#### [Flu Vaccine in Pregnancy Offers Brief Protection of Babies](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/flu-vaccine-in-pregnancy-offers-brief-protection-of-babies/?_r=0) New York Times

* “In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, researchers measured the efficacy of the flu vaccine on the unborn children of vaccinated pregnant women by comparing rates of disease and levels of antibodies in 1,026 infants born to vaccinated women and 1,023 controls born to unvaccinated mothers.”

* “The vaccine was about 86 percent effective until the babies were 8 weeks old. But between 8 and 24 weeks, its power dropped rapidly, and the effect of the vaccine became statistically insignificant.”
