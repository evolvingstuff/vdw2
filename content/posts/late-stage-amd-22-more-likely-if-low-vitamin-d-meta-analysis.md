 **Highlights** 

• Vitamin D may be involved in ocular health and function.

• High concentrations 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with less age-related macular degeneration.

• Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D under 50nmol/L are associated with late-stage age-related macular degeneration.

• These findings provide a scientific basis for vitamin D replacement trials.

Vitamin D may be involved in ocular function in older adults, but there is no current consensus on a possible association between circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and the occurrence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Our objective was to systematically review and quantitatively assess the association of circulating 25OHD concentration with AMD. A Medline search was conducted in November 2015, with no date limit, using the MeSH terms “Vitamin D‘OR “Vitamin D deficiency“OR “Ergocalciferols” OR ‘Cholecalciferol’ combined with “Age-related macular degeneration“OR “Macular degeneration“OR “Retinal degeneration“OR “Macula lutea“OR “Retina’. Fixed and random-effects meta-analyses were performed to compute i) standard mean difference in 25OHD concentration between AMD and non-AMD patients; ii) AMD risk according to circulating 25OHD concentration. Of the 243 retrieved studies, 11 observational studies single bond 10 cross-sectional studies and 1 cohort study single bond met the selection criteria. The number of participants ranged from 65 to 17,045 (52-100% women), and the number with AMD ranged from 31 to 1440. Circulating 25OHD concentration was 15% lower in AMD compared with non-AMD on average. AMD was inversely associated with the highest 25OHD quintile compared with the lowest (summary odds ratio (OR) = 0.83 <span>[95%CI:0.71–0.97]</span>), notably late AMD (summary OR = 0.47 <span>[95%CI:0.28–0.79]</span>). Circulating 25OHD <50nmol/L was also associated with late-stage AMD (summary  **OR = 2.18**  <span>[95%CI:1.34–3.56]</span>), an association that did not persist when all categories of AMD were considered (summary OR = 1.26 <span>[95%CI:0.90–1.76]</span>). In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that high 25OHD concentrations may be protective against AMD, and that 25OHD concentrations below 50nmol/L are associated with late AMD.
