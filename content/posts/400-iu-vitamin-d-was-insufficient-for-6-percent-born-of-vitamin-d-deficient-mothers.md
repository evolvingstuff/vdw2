Aim: To determine whether a standard daily dose of 400 IU vitamin D is sufficient to normalize vitamin D levels in infants born to vitamin D-deficient mothers. 

Methods: The children were recruited from a study cohort of 68 immigrant and 51 non-immigrant pregnant women living in Stockholm. The women were monitored at 12 weeks of pregnancy, at delivery and together with their children, 6-18 months after birth. During pregnancy, most immigrant women (78%) had 25(OH)D3 levels <25 nmol/l. We here report the outcome of 25 infants born to these mothers. All infants received a daily supplementation dose of 400 IU vitamin D from 2 weeks of age. 

Results: At birth, most children in the immigrant group were vitamin D-deficient (23.3 nmol/l (12-54); mean and range) while at 6-18 months of age vitamin D levels were essentially normalized (82.8 nmol/l (38-142)) although 4 children still had subnormal levels consistent with vitamin D insufficiency. 

Conclusion: A daily recommended supplementation dose of 400 IU vitamin D is sufficient in most children of vitamin D-deficient immigrant women living in Sweden.
