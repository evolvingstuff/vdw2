#### Nutritional rickets: calcium or vitamin D deficiency? – Editorial

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, nqab121, https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab121

Sempos et al. (1) in the present issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition studied the interaction between vitamin D status <span>[defined by serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D]</span> and calcium intake in Nigerian children with rickets. They observed that a serum concentration of 25(OH)D below 47.5 (possibly even 65) nmol/l was associated with an increased risk of rickets in children with a very low calcium intake (about 200 mg/d). Indeed, the calcium intake of the ricketic children was similar to that of healthy controls, whereas serum 25(OH)D strongly discriminated between both groups. This 25(OH)D threshold is much higher than the one [25–30 nmol/L (2–4...
