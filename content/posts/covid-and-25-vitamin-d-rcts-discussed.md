##### Comment by VitaminDWiki

In order for the body to fight COVID the Vitamin D level must be high BEFORE COVID has gotten out of control in the body. 

Similarly, a fire truck cannot put out a major fire once it has gotten out of control.

1. RCTs that do NOT use a loading dose within a few days of infection (not just entering the hospital)  will likely fail.

1. The Vitamin D level needed to fight COVID appears to be 125 nmol (50 ng), not just the 75 nmol (30 ng) needed to fight bone problems.
