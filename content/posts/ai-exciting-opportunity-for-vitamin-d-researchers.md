Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI) is any computer program that uncovers relationships in vast amounts of data. Often these associations are previously unknown or unsuspected. AI is maturing and is already beginning to impact all fields of study, including research and medical practice. As computing power increases the cost goes down, and the quantity and quality of genetic and health data of individuals increases exponentially, the opportunities for health professionals to exploit the data with AI become enormous. 

In just the past 3 years there has been a 1,000 times increase in the computing power which can be applied to an AI task. So the same task can be completed 1000X faster, or the additional compute power can provide 1000X deeper analysis in the same amount of time. 

Using AI, Vitamin D researchers will within the next 5 years be able to improve the design of their experiments based on analysis of data in studies including data from previous experiments, set optimum dosages, and take into account multiple real factors that will affect the success of outcomes. 

Using raw data from individual studies rather than relying solely on meta-analyses will improve the confidence of RCTs.  

Researchers will be able to use data from “failed” experiments, get proofs from wide-spread but incomplete data, and get preliminary results very quickly. Observational non-RCTs, which make up a majority of published research, can often be modified in real time, based on instant analysis of ongoing data. 

Medical practitioners will be able to tailor their recommendations to individuals based on data available from hundreds to millions of similar cases, and can be quickly and comprehensively informed of updates on specific diseases.

Truly, the future of AI in Vitamin D research and practice is mind-boggling.

If this abstract is accepted, this page will have the entire presentation in June, 2019

 **Deep Medicine, by Eric Topol - March 2019** 

Excellent review of 100+ wide-ranging applications of AI in Medicine

Already applications are developed and underway - costing $1 million to $600 million 

I continue to estimate the AI applications to Vitamin D to cost < $1 million

 **Some notes from the book** 

30% of Breast Cancer surgeries could be avoided by AI analysis of images

Book has a nice concept: AI finds your "digital Twin" in the mountain of data

AI is doing speech analysis for 30+ speech parameter to predict Parkinson's and many other health problems

AI analysis of images (Xray, CT) can be done with 1/10 to 1/100 as much energy

&nbsp; &nbsp; thus CT scans could be done with AI in < 10 minutes

AI is moving much faster in drug discovery and research than in areas which are slowed up by the FDA

All health-related things need to be individualized - due to gut. gene, etc

&nbsp; &nbsp;Reactions differ between Individuals: food eaten (e.g. bread) , drugs, supplements (vitamin D), etc

 **My observations** 

I disagree with Topol - Radiologists and pathologists should fear for their jobs

&nbsp; &nbsp; AI can already find microfractures as small as 0.01% of the image

&nbsp; &nbsp; Metastasis detection: AI 92%, Pathologists 73%

I would hope that AI could slow up the rising health care costs in < 5 years
