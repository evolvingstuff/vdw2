#### Patterns of vitamin D testing and supplementation for children with inflammatory bowel disease in Australasia

JGH Open . 2024 Mar 4;8(3):e13041. [doi: 10.1002/jgh3.13041](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.13041)

Background and aim: For children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), optimal levels of vitamin D are ascribed anti-inflammatory and essential immune system roles that are associated with reduced disease activity, lower postoperative recurrence, and higher quality of life. International guidelines for vitamin D testing and supplementation provide inconsistent recommendations. The aim of this study was to survey Australasian pediatric gastroenterologists to ascertain current practices of vitamin D testing and supplementation for children with IBD.

Methods: Members of the Australian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition were invited to complete an online survey. Respondents were asked to provide information on frequency of vitamin D testing and supplementation, adherence, and benefits of vitamin D to children with IBD.

Results: Thirty-two (54%) pediatric gastroenterologists completed the survey: 27 (84%) from Australia and 5 (16%) from New Zealand. The majority (90%) tested vitamin D levels at diagnosis and follow up, although testing frequency varied (1-3 times/year) and only 8 (28%) tested seasonally. While 28 (88%) recommended supplementation based on serum levels, inconsistent cutoff values were used. Most respondents (n = 27) recommended Stoss (single dose) or vitamin D3 (daily for 8-12 weeks). The majority (84%) rated the overall benefit of optimal vitamin D levels at ≥6/10, although fewer (54%) rated the benefit to disease activity at ≥6/10.

Conclusions: The results indicate that standardized guidelines for vitamin D testing and supplementation for clinicians caring for children with IBD throughout Australasia are required. Consensus statements may optimize the care of children with IBD in this diverse geographical region.
