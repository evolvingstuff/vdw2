#### Preoperative Vitamin D Supplementation is a Cost-Effective Intervention in Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair

J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2023 Jun 10 [doi: 10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2023.05.007) &nbsp; $28 PDF

Background: This study investigates the potential role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective strategy to decrease revision rotator cuff repair (RCR) rates and lower the total healthcare burden from patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR. Previous literature has emphasized the importance of vitamin D on bone health maintenance, soft tissue healing, and outcomes in RCR. Inadequate preoperative vitamin D levels may increase revision RCR rates following primary arthroscopic RCR. Although 25(OH)D deficiency is common in RCR patients, serum screening is not routinely performed.

Methods: A cost-estimation model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of both preoperative selective and nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation in RCR patients in order to reduce revision RCR rates. Prevalence and surgical cost data was obtained from published literature through systematic reviews. Cost of serum 25(OH)D assay and supplementation were obtained from public-use data. Mean, lower and upper bounds of  **one year cost-savings**  were calculated for both the selective and nonselective supplementation scenarios.

Results: Preoperative 25(OH)D screening and subsequent selective 25(OH)D supplementation was calculated to result in a  **mean cost-savings of $6,099,341** (range: $-2,993,000 - $15,191,683)  **per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases.** 

 **$24 per procedure (just those who were deficient)** 

 **Nonselective 25(OH)D supplementation**  of all arthroscopic RCR patients was calculated to result in a mean cost-savings of $11,584,742 (range: $2,492,401 - $20,677,085) per 250,000 primary arthroscopic RCR cases. Univariate adjustment projects that selective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical contexts where the cost of revision RCR exceeds $14,824.69 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency exceeds 6.67%. Additionally, nonselective supplementation is a cost-effective strategy in clinical scenarios where revision RCR cost ≥ $4,216.06 and prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency ≥ 1.93%.

 **$46 per procedure (Vitamin D given to everyone, no testing)** 

Conclusions: This cost-predictive model promotes the role of preoperative 25(OH)D supplementation as a cost-effective mechanism to reduce revision RCR rates and lower the overall healthcare burden from arthroscopic RCR. Nonselective supplementation appears to be more cost-effective than selective supplementation, likely due to the lower cost of 25(OH)D supplementation compared to serum assays.

#### Loading doses should be completed 3+ days before any surgery

Total loading doses range from 100,000 IU to 400,000 IU for average adult

&nbsp; &nbsp; The dose size given in this study is behind a $$ paywall

Smaller dose if younger, Larger dose if overweight/obese

Doctors recommend loading spanning from a single session to several weeks

Much faster: Nanoemulsion Vitamin D swished in mouth - 2 hours to get to the blood

Much slower and expensive: Injection)) - 10 days to get from muscle to bloodstream

 **Note: Surgeries can drop the [vitamin D levels by half](/posts/pro-inflammatory-cytokines-cause-the-74-percent-drop-in-vitamin-d-after-knee-arthroplasty)**
