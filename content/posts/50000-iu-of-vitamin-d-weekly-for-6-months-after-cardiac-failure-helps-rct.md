Background: Low vitamin D status may contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF), but therapeutic roles of vitamin D on cardiac performance are not well known. We evaluated vitamin D effects on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in patients with HF for the first time.

Methods: This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. 110 patients with HF admitted to Shahid Chamran and Khorshid Hospitals, Isfahan, Iran, randomly received  **500 mg calcium daily plus either 50000 IU vitamin D3 per week**  (case group) or placebo (control group) for 6 months. Biochemical variables, LVEF, and NYHA functional class were assessed at baseline and after 6 months.

Results: 81 patients completed the study. Vitamin D supplementation increased mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration in the case group by 33.9 ng/ml (P < 0.001). After 6 months of treatment, both groups showed improvement in LVEF, but the extent of improvement was significant only in the case group (5.48% versus 0.44%, P < 0.001). The NYHA functional class improved in the case group but remained constant in the control group (P < 0.001).

Conclusion: Vitamin D3 improved LVEF and NYHA functional class in patients with HF and might serve as a new agent for the future treatment of this disease.
