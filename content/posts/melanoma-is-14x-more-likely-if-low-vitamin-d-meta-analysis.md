#### Vitamin D insufficiency and serum levels related to the incidence and stage of cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis

Melanoma Res . 2023 May 18. [doi: 10.1097/CMR.0000000000000897](https://doi.org/10.1097/CMR.0000000000000897) PDF is behind a $51 paywall

Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the deadliest skin cancer, and vitamin D insufficiency has been suggested as a risk factor. We evaluated the relationship between both vitamin D insufficiency and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels with the incidence and stage of CM. Five databases were searched from inception until 11 July 2022. Inclusion criteria were cohort and case-control studies that reported mean 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels or the presence of vitamin D insufficiency in CM patients and compared with healthy controls; or those that reported vitamin D insufficiency and Breslow tumor depth or the development of metastasis in CM. 

Fourteen studies were included in the analysis. 

Statistically significant relationships were found between 

* vitamin D level <20 ng/dl and incidence of CM <span>[pooled __RR 1.45__, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.02]</span>; 

* lower mean vitamin D level and Breslow depth >1 mm (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.28); and 

* vitamin D level >20 ng/dl and Breslow depth <1 mm (pooled RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82). 

Statistical significance was not found in the relationships between vitamin D levels and the presence of metastasis (pooled SMD -0.13, 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.12); or mean vitamin D level and the incidence of CM (pooled SMD -0.39, 95% CI, -0.80 to 0.01). 

We identified an association of increased incidence of CM and vitamin D insufficiency, as well as less favorable Breslow tumor depth with lower levels of vitamin D and the presence of vitamin D insufficiency.
