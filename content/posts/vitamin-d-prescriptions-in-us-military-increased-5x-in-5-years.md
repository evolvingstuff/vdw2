* Suspect it has been more than 5X in the most recent 5 years

* This appears to be number of prescriptions, not the amount of IU prescribed

* Suspect that even more vitamin D was consumed which was not prescribed.

 **Thus huge potential economic benefits to military for increasing Vitamin D include:** 

 **DECREASED**  brain trauma, stress fractures, suicide. breast cancer, MS, time in ICU, etc.

 **DECREASED COST**  Of health care for both active military and veterans

 **INCREASED FORCE READINESS** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the way: Vitamin  **C**  was the focus of perhaps the first Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in 1758 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took the English govt over 100 years to give Vitamin  **C**  to their sailors

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to increase "force readiness" to fight the French

INTRODUCTION:

Although prior studies have examined the prevalence of dietary supplement use among various populations, data on single vitamins prescribed by health care providers are limited.

OBJECTIVE:

This study examined trends in single-vitamin supplement (A, C, D, E, K) prescriptions by providers from military treatment facilities from 2007 to 2011.

METHODS:

We examined prescription data from the Department of Defense Pharmacy Data Transaction Service to determine trends in the aforementioned single-vitamin supplement prescriptions. Prescription rates per 1,000 active duty personnel were estimated using population data retrieved from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (i.e., [number of prescriptions/population size](number%20of%20prescriptions/population%20size) × 1,000).

RESULTS:

 **Across the 5-year period, the number of vitamin D prescriptions per 1,000 active duty personnel increased 454%.**  In contrast, the number of vitamin A, vitamin E, and vitamin K prescriptions per 1,000 active duty personnel decreased by 32%, 53%, and 29% respectively. Vitamin C prescriptions remained relatively constant. Across all age groups, total single-vitamin supplement prescriptions increased by 180%.

CONCLUSION:

Together, prescriptions examined in this study increased steadily from 2007 to 2011, primarily because of the increase in vitamin D prescriptions. The exhibited trend reflects the current general-population pattern of dietary supplement use, with large increases in vitamin D and declines in vitamin E.
