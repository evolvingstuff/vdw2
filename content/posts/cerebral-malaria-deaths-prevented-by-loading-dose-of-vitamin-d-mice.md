 **Cerebral malaria is a severe form of Malaria, which accounts for about half of Malaria deaths** 

Mice got 2000 IU/kg vitamin D for 5 days in a row  before getting PbA (mimicks Cerebral Malaria)

For an 80 kg human, this would have been 160,000 IU per day

800,000 IU total, which is about 2X larger than typical loading doses.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Mice with Vitamin D:  all survived</span>  
Mice wihout Vitamin D: all dead by 11th day**

Cerebral malaria (CM) is a serious and fatal malaria-associated syndrome caused by the development of an overwhelming proinflammatory response. Vitamin D (Vit.D; cholecalciferol) has regulatory functions associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. Prevention is better than cure, in this experiment, we evaluated prophylactic oral Vit.D as a means of preventing CM presentation before infection of C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) by modulating the host proinflammatory response. 

Mice that were supplemented with oral Vit.D has reduce death rate and ameliorated the integrity of the blood brain barrier. Prophylactic oral vitamin D relieved the symptoms of brain malaria and avoided death, gained valuable time for the diagnosis and treatment post infection. The robust Th1 response was attenuated in the Vit.D + PbA group. Furthermore, T-cell trafficking to the brain was diminished before PbA infection using Vit.D. The results suggest that Vit.D supplementation mediates the development of an anti-inflammatory environment that improves CM severity. In summary, the use of Vit.D as a nutritional supplement in malaria-endemic regions may help reduce the severity and mortality of CM.
