#### Biofortified tomatoes provide a new route to vitamin D sufficiency - May 2022

Poor vitamin D status is a global health problem; insufficiency underpins higher risk of cancer, neurocognitive decline and all-cause mortality. Most foods contain little vitamin D and plants are very poor sources. We have engineered the accumulation of provitamin D3 in tomato by genome editing, modifying a duplicated section of phytosterol biosynthesis in Solanaceous plants, to provide a biofortified food with the added possibility of supplement production from waste material.

UVB..."Treatment of leaves was very effective, resulting in yields of vitamin D3 of nearly 200 μg g−1 dry weight""

Note :Tomotoe leaves are 100% editable, and often are cooked
