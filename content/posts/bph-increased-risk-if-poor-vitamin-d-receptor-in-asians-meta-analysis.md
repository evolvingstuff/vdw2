#### Systematic review and meta-analysis of candidate gene association studies of benign prostate hyperplasia

Background: Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common urological problem in elderly males. Recent studies have reported polymorphism in various metabolic genes in BPH. However, their association with the susceptibility of BPH is still inconsistent. Here, we systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of CYP17, VDR, and ACE genes to determine their precise association with the risk of BPH.

Methods: A comprehensive literature search for published studies on candidate gene associations involving vitamin D receptor (VDR), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and CYP17 genes with the risk of BPH was done up to April 2020 in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar databases. Fixed/random effects models were used to estimate the odd's ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Begg's funnel plot was used to assess the potential for publication bias.

Results: We found a total of 23 studies containing 3461 cases and 3833 controls for these gene polymorphisms. A significant association of ACE gene polymorphism was observed under the recessive (II vs. ID + DD) model for BPH susceptibility compared to control subjects (overall OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.03-2.73). Similar trends were observed for ACE gene polymorphism in Caucasian (OR = 6.18, 95% CI = 1.38-27.68) and Asian (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.99-2.03) populations under study. No significant association was observed in VDR and CYP17 gene polymorphisms in any dominant or recessive models.

Conclusion: Significant OR demonstrated the implication of ACE gene polymorphism in the proliferation of prostate tissue, which in turn is associated with BPH susceptibility. However, prospective studies at large scale and sample size are needed to confirm the current findings.
