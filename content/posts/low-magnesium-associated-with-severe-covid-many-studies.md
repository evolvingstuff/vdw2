#### Can Maintaining Optimal Magnesium Balance Reduce the Disease Severity of COVID-19 Patients? –March 2022

Front. Endocrinol. 13:843152. [doi: 10.3389/fendo.2022.843152](https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.843152)

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caught the world by surprise, claiming millions of lives due to its deadly effects. Ongoing research studies evaluate the measures that can reduce the severity of symptoms in patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Magnesium is an essential nutrient that has many studied benefits in humans. This brief commentary aims to describe the potential benefits of magnesium on COVID-19 patients and the reported effects of low versus high magnesium levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Also, the potential benefits of vitamin D and how magnesium acts as a cofactor to activate vitamin D functions are elaborated. The results of the existing studies point towards evidence that magnesium may have significant benefits in reducing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. There is also evidence that magnesium-dependent vitamin D activities may have antiviral effects, thus potentially being able to reduce rates of COVID-19 infection, which is a hypothesis that should be further tested.

The COVID-19 primarily causes respiratory distress but has a broad range of other clinical manifestations and affects various organs and systems in the body. COVID-19 is especially lethal to elderly populations at higher risk (1,2). As of September 3rd, 2021, the current worldwide death rate of individuals infected by COVID-19 is 4,539,723 (World Health Organization). Many public health measures have already been taken to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as face mask mandates, vaccine inoculation, quarantine, social distancing, limited capacities at public venues, and a shift to online work. However, COVID-19 is still proving to be a health concern as cases of infection continue to rise. The continued infection of individuals by COVID-19 may be due to the high transmissibility of the virus (3-6). It is also proposed that some of the new variants of the virus are even more rapidly transmissible and lethal. Thus, certain preventative measures are essential to find to reduce the severity of symptoms and improve patient outcomes in individuals that have been infected, since the prevention of infection is not always possible.

Basic nutrients that optimize physiologic functions in the body, such as magnesium, maybe used as a prophylactic measure that can improve patient outcomes in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and potentially even reduce the intensity of the infection by the virus by potentiating vitamin D functions. In the U.S., more than 50% of people are magnesium deficient (7, 8), and magnesium deficiency is also prevalent in many other countries. The low level of magnesium in the general population may make individuals more vulnerable to viral insults. The high prevalence of magnesium deficiency makes it important to determine how optimal and suboptimal magnesium levels affect COVID-19 patient outcomes, which this paper aims to elaborate on.

#### Role of Magnesium in Acute and Long COVID - Drbeen video Jan 2023

 **[YouTube 41 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBUiA4hOg4&t=24s&ab_channel=DrbeenMedicalLectures)** 

Magnesium is an essential mineral/nutrient required for more than 600 enzymatic actions in our body. Magnesium levels are also tied closely with the activation of vitamin D. Magnesium is involved in smooth muscle relaxation, neuroprotection, innate arm modulation, gut microbiome modulation, and much more. Let's look at the role of magnesium and importance of its levels to be correct in our body. If you like this content and want more, I am doing a special lifetime membership offer.
