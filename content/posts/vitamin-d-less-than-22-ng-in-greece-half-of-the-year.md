OBJECTIVE: The precise  incidence of vitamin  D deficiency  is not known, primarily  because there is no consensus on the optimal  levels  of serum  25(OH)Vitamin D. The aim of the pre- sent study was to determine the incidence of vitamin  D deficiency  in a large group of normal adult volunteers residing in a typical temperate region. 

DESIGN-METHODS: In 625 healthy, free  living  adults (553  women,  72 men,  aged  18-85  years),  serum  25(OH)Vitamin D and 1-25(OH)2Vitamin D (RIA), plasma intact PTH (eclIA) and routine chemistries (multianalyser) were determined at baseline once during a whole year. In a subgroup of 36 subjects,  a vitamin D loading  (suppression) test was also performed  to define the lower normal values for these two Vitamin  D metabolites. 

RESULTS: The estimated lower normal  values,  based  on the results of the vitamin  D2  loading  test, were 22ng/ml  (55nmol/l) for 25(OH)Vitamin D and 24.6pg/ml (59 pmol/l)  for 1-25(OH)2Vitamin D. 

During  the whole year, the incidence of low values  was 57.7% for 25(OH)Vitamin D and 33.2% for 1-25(OH)2Vitamin D. A highly significant (p<0.001) positive  linear  correlation of serum  25(OH)Vitamin D with 1-25(OH)2Vitamin D values  and a negative  correlation of 25(OH)Vitamin D with intact PTH was observed in the entire group and separately in women without or with osteoporosis and osteopenia. 

CONCLUSION: Most of the white normal adults living in a temperate region were vitamin D deficient. The observed correlations between serum concentrations of 25(OH)Vitamin D and 1-25(OH)2Vitamin D as well as of 25(OH)Vitamin D and intact PTH, suggest  that 25(OH)Vitamin D is implicated not only in 1-25(OH)2Vitamin D production but also in PTH secretion.
