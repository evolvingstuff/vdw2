This study offers evidence that vitamin D deficiency could be a major public health burden among young Emirati adults, mostly because of sun deprivation in a sun-blessed country. 

This study included a random sample of 138 females and 70 males tested for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> status. 

To further evaluate the predictors of vitamin D status in this population, the study examined diet, obesity and sun exposure. 

In summer, the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration for females was 20.9 ± 14.9 nmol/L, whereas that for males was 27.3 ± 15.7 nmol/L. 

 **Females scored significantly higher than males on the sun avoidance inventory (SAI)** , indicating that females avoid sun exposure to a greater extent than males, possibly explaining the lower vitamin D status. 

A significant negative correlation also existed between SAI and vitamin D status (Pearson's r = -0.33; p < 0.01), but no significant association was evident between vitamin D status and body mass index (Pearson's r = 0.03; p = 0.33) or low dietary intake of vitamin D-fortified foods (Pearson's r = 0.08; p = 0.13). 

The mean serum 25(OH)D concentration for females tested in winter was 31.3 ± 12.3 nmol/L while in the summer, it was 20.9 ± 14.9 nmol/L. 

This difference was statistically significant, suggesting that seasonal variation plays an important role in vitamin D status in the United Arab Emirates. 

Fortification of foods and drinks with vitamin D, supplementation and sensible sun exposure are important steps toward minimizing vitamin D deficiency.
