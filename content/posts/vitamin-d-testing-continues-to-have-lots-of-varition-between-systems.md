BACKGROUND/METHODS: A total of 95 human serum specimens, and a 12 specimen precision panel, were measured by 2 automated immunoassays (investigation use only DiaSorin LIAISON(®) 25 OH Vitamin D TOTAL Assay <span>[LSN]</span>, and Siemens ADVIA Centaur(®) Vitamin D Total (VitD) assay <span>[Centaur]</span>) and the results compared against LC-MS/MS <span>[LCMS]</span> used as the reference method (Esoterix Inc.). For functional sensitivity and precision, 12 serum specimens [range 1.2-148ng/mL](range%201.2-148ng/mL) were run in six replicates <span>[N=30]</span> or four replicates <span>[N=20]</span>, respectively, for 5 consecutive days.

RESULTS: Passing-Bablok fit and Difference plot analysis <span>[N=92]</span> showed that although both immunoassays had comparable correlation coefficient <span>[r]</span> values to LCMS (0.936 and 0.933), the LSN assay results were statistically equivalent to those given by LCMS (slope 0.93, intercept -2.5), whereas the results of the Centaur assay showed overall significant assay bias compared to LCMS (slope 1.30, intercept -15.8) and this bias was more significant for doses <30ng/mL by LCMS <span>[bias -30.4%; 95% limits of agreement -72.4% to 11.7%]</span>. For specificity, based on 25-OHD(2) and 25-OHD(3) levels assessed by LCMS, we divided the specimens into 2 groups, one with detectable 25-OHD(2) <span>[Group 1, N=41]</span> and the other with no detectible 25OHD(2) <span>[Group 2, N=51]</span>. The 2 groups showed comparable correlation coefficient <span>[r]</span> values between the methods, but showed significant differences in slope: Centaur <span>[1.48 with group 1 and 1.18 with group 2]</span> compared to LSN <span>[0.91 with Group 1 and 0.96 with Group 2]</span>. LSN demonstrated better precision <span>[total CV range 5.5-10.0%]</span> compared to Centaur <span>[total CV range 11.0-16.3%]</span>. Functional sensitivity was calculated per EP-17A: 2.15ng/mL by LSN and 4.57ng/mL by Centaur.

CONCLUSIONS: Though there was good overall correlation, substantial bias was present in Centaur. Although LSN had a slope and intercept that was not significantly different than LCMS, Centaur had a significantly higher slope in specimens containing measurable 25-OHD(2) levels, a large negative intercept and a significant negative dose bias for doses <30ng/mL by LCMS, suggesting the Centaur assay would report a higher frequency of patients with apparent vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency at the low end and apparent vitamin D toxicity at the high end compared against LCMS.

###  **Note: 100 nmol = 40 ng** 

## Level of quantification generally 10 nmol, but one is much higher, 50 nmol

### Day-to-day variation is an acceptable 7nmol for blood level of about 170 nmol

## Frequently failed to correctly say blood level was > 40 nmol (false negative)

### 10X fewer times failed to correctly say blood level was < 40 nmol (false positive)

### Ideally all colored bars in a group should be the same height

### These are worst-case examples of discrepancies between readings

### Sample 4: most measured about 70 nmol (28 ng), but one measured 19 nmol ( 8 ng)
