&lt;h4 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Vitamin D plays a critical role in bone metabolism and many cellular and immunological processes, and low vitamin D levels have been associated with several chronic and infectious diseases. Previous studies have reported that many otherwise healthy adults of European ancestry living in Canada have low vitamin D concentrations during the wintertime. However, individuals of non-European ancestry are at a higher risk of having low vitamin D levels. This thesis examined vitamin D status in a sample of young adults of diverse ancestry living in the Greater Toronto Area. In my research I found that:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review of Vitamin D Deficiencies in developing countries</title><link>/posts/review-of-vitamin-d-deficiencies-in-developing-countries.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/review-of-vitamin-d-deficiencies-in-developing-countries.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>14000 IU vitamin D (50000 twice a week) often stops Sickle Cell pain</title><link>/posts/14000-iu-vitamin-d-50000-twice-a-week-often-stops-sickle-cell-pain.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/14000-iu-vitamin-d-50000-twice-a-week-often-stops-sickle-cell-pain.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="several-items-on-this-page">Several items on this page&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Aims:? To evaluate the association between vitamin D insufficiency and peripheral neuropathy in a nationally representative sample of adults with diagnosed diabetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Methods:? Vitamin D concentrations, medical examination variables and questionnaire results from the 2001–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analysed for adults ? 40 years old with diagnosed diabetes (unweighted n = 591, weighted n = 8.82 million). Neuropathy was defined as self report of peripheral neuropathy symptoms of painful sensation, tingling, numbness or loss of feeling in hands or feet. Additionally, Semmes–Weinstein monofilament test results were used as an indicator of neuropathy. Insufficient vitamin D was characterized as &lt;strong>&amp;lt; 30 ng/ml.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black members of Adventist church defy health disparities</title><link>/posts/black-members-of-adventist-church-defy-health-disparities.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/black-members-of-adventist-church-defy-health-disparities.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="medical-expresshttpmedicalxpresscomnews2011-06-black-members-adventist-church-defyhtml">&lt;a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-06-black-members-adventist-church-defy.html">Medical Express&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Dear Vitamin D Council Member,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need your help! This summer, the Vitamin D Council is set to file a 17-page complaint against Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding their vitamin D food fortification policies and how they disparately afflict African Americans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through a combination of mandated and encouraged practices, the FDA depends upon milk to deliver virtually all supplemental dietary vitamin D to Americans. The FDA knows African Americans consume little milk, particularly relative to Caucasian Americans. The FDA, in effect, chooses to fortify a food that does not target a population who most need vitamin D.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Studies linked low vitamin D and dark skin to Obesity, Diabetes, and heart</title><link>/posts/studies-linked-low-vitamin-d-and-dark-skin-to-obesity-diabetes-and-heart.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/studies-linked-low-vitamin-d-and-dark-skin-to-obesity-diabetes-and-heart.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-obesity-and-obesity-related-chronic-disease-among-ethnic-minorities-a-systematic-review">Vitamin D, obesity, and obesity-related chronic disease among ethnic minorities: A systematic review.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>WHO Collaborating Centre for Obesity Prevention, Deakin University, Burwood , Victoria, Australia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OBJECTIVE:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To assess the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) status and obesity, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in ethnic minorities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>METHODS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Databases searched were CINHAL with full text, Global Health, MEDLINE with full text, and PsycINFO from 1980 through 2010 (February). Studies were included if they 1) targeted immigrants from low- to high-income countries or ethnic minorities, 2) focused primarily on 25(OH)D and its relation to obesity, T2DM, and/or CVDs, and 3) were published in peer-reviewed journals. The influences of key confounders such as age, gender, and ethnicity on any observed relations were also assessed. Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics, only a narrative synthesis was undertaken.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark skinned teens use media much more</title><link>/posts/dark-skinned-teens-use-media-much-more.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-skinned-teens-use-media-much-more.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="clipped-from-good-website-kids-of-color-consume-a-lot-more-media-than-white-kidshttpwwwgoodispostkids-of-color-consume-a-lot-more-media-than-white-kids-june-2011">Clipped from Good website: &lt;a href="http://www.good.is/post/kids-of-color-consume-a-lot-more-media-than-white-kids/">Kids of Color Consume a Lot More Media Than White Kids&lt;/a> June 2011&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent worldwide, and is linked to several major chronic, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D deficiency has not been evaluated in dark skinned individuals living in areas of high sun exposure utilizing more reliable mass spectrometry assay techniques. We determined the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency in Afro-Caribbean men on the tropical island of Tobago, where there is a high level of sunshine year round. Serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 metabolites were measured following extraction and purification using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry in 424 Afro-Caribbean men aged &amp;gt; 65 years from a larger population-based cohort study.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dark skin pregnancies and Vitamin D - many studies</title><link>/posts/dark-skin-pregnancies-and-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dark-skin-pregnancies-and-vitamin-d-many-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">

&lt;p>Mounting evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency could be linked to several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its correlates to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency was common in the US population, especially in certain minority groups. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2006 data were analyzed for vitamin D levels in adult participants (N = 4495). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations ?20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). The overall prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency was 41.6%, with the highest rate seen in blacks (82.1%), followed by Hispanics (69.2%). Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more common among those who had no college education, were obese, with a poor health status, hypertension, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or not consuming milk daily (all P &amp;lt; .001). Multivariate analyses showed that&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>50000 IU vitamin D2 weekly helped blacks with heart problems</title><link>/posts/50000-iu-vitamin-d2-weekly-helped-blacks-with-heart-problems.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/50000-iu-vitamin-d2-weekly-helped-blacks-with-heart-problems.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="supplemental-vitamin-d-and-calcium-in-the-management-of-african-americans-with-heart-failure-having-hypovitaminosis-d">Supplemental vitamin D and calcium in the management of African Americans with heart failure having hypovitaminosis D.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>INTRODUCTION: A dyshomeostasis of macro- and micronutrients, including vitamin D and oxidative stress, are common pathophysiologic features in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In African Americans (AA) with CHF, reductions in plasma 25(OH)D are of moderate-to-marked severity (&amp;lt;20 ng/mL) and may be accompanied by ionized hypocalcemia with compensatory increases in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH). The management of hypovitaminosis D in AA with CHF has not been established.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vitamin D levels in Israel vs skin type and age</title><link>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-in-israel-vs-skin-type-and-age.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/vitamin-d-levels-in-israel-vs-skin-type-and-age.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="serum-25ohd-concentrations-in-sunny-israel">Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in sunny Israel.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>African Americans have higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and some forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than do European Americans. African Americans also have much higher rates of vitamin D deficiency. There is emerging evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for hypertension, T2D, and CVD, but the extent to which racial disparities in disease rates are explained by racial differences in vitamin D status is uncertain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Black obese children had low vitamin D and more fat under skin than whites</title><link>/posts/black-obese-children-had-low-vitamin-d-and-more-fat-under-skin-than-whites.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/black-obese-children-had-low-vitamin-d-and-more-fat-under-skin-than-whites.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-status-adiposity-and-lipids-in-black-american-and-caucasian-children">Vitamin D Status, Adiposity, and Lipids in Black American and Caucasian Children.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background A growing body of evidence has linked vitamin D deficiency to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency is also more common in African Americans for whom an increased cardiovascular disease risk exists. This study sought to test the hypothesis that 16 weeks of 60,000 IU monthly supplementation of oral vitamin D(3) would improve flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in African Americans, whereas no change would be observed in the placebo group.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>South African white children 48 ng vitamin D – black 37 ng</title><link>/posts/south-african-white-children-48-ng-vitamin-d-black-37-ng.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/south-african-white-children-48-ng-vitamin-d-black-37-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="factors-influencing-the-vitamin-d-status-of-10-year-old-urban-south-african-children">Factors influencing the vitamin D status of 10-year-old urban South African children.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Anemia and vitamin D deficiency are conditions that both result in significant morbidity and increase with age. The potential relationship between them remains poorly understood, particularly in the elderly. We utilized the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to examine the association of vitamin D deficiency with anemia subtypes in individuals aged &amp;gt; 60 years. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum levels &lt;strong>&amp;lt; 20 ng/mL&lt;/strong> and anemia was defined according to World Health Organization criteria.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Calcium with Vitamin D2 then D3 helps A-A after heart failure</title><link>/posts/calcium-with-vitamin-d2-then-d3-helps-a-a-after-heart-failure.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/calcium-with-vitamin-d2-then-d3-helps-a-a-after-heart-failure.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="supplemental-vitamin-d-and-calcium-in-the-management-of-african-americans-with-heart-failure-having-hypovitaminosis-d">Supplemental Vitamin D and Calcium in the Management of African Americans With Heart Failure Having Hypovitaminosis D.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Over the past 5 years, the messages regarding vitamin D have been both confusing and conflicting and the Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) recent report has only made it more complex. Last month, the IOM, which sets the dietary reference intakes for nutrients, published new guidelines for calcium and vitamin D. Although the recommended dietary allowances (600-800 IUs, depending on age) and the upper limit of the vitamin D intake (4,000 IUs) are higher than the IOM’s 1997 recommendations, it is not as high as some experts, researchers and other health professionals had anticipated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Many possible associations of increased asthma in black children</title><link>/posts/many-possible-associations-of-increased-asthma-in-black-children.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/many-possible-associations-of-increased-asthma-in-black-children.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="racial-disparities-in-pediatric-asthma-a-review-of-the-literature">Racial Disparities in Pediatric Asthma: A Review of the Literature.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The burden of asthma disproportionately affects children living in economically disadvantaged urban communities. The relationships between ethnicity, genetic differences, lower socioeconomic status, poor medication adherence, greater exposure to environmental triggers, and absence of regular asthma care all contribute to this disparity. This review aims to identify and discuss recent studies on additional factors that may also impact to pediatric asthma disparity.

&lt;p>Black individuals have lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> levels and experience a disproportionate burden of ESRD compared with white individuals. Animal studies suggest that vitamin D has renoprotective effects. We evaluated the contribution of low 25(OH)D levels on incidence of ESRD using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-linked Medicare claims files (n = 13,328). We included baseline (1988 through 1994) measurements of 25(OH)D and assessed the incidence of ESRD through July 31, 2001.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
