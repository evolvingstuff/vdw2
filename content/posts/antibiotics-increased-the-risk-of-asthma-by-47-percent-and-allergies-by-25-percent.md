#### [Antibiotics May Raise the Risk of Allergies](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/well/live/antibiotics-allergies-infants.html) NYT

Taking an antibiotic was associated with a significantly increased risk for anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction), asthma, food allergies, and allergies and inflammation of the skin (dermatitis), respiratory tract (rhinitis) and eyes (conjunctivitis).

* Penicillin increased the risk by 30 percent, 

* macrolides by 28 percent and 

* cephalosporins by 19 percent 

compared to infants who had been given no antibiotic prescriptions.
