#### New AI tool searches genetic haystacks to find disease-causing variants

 **[Washington Post $$](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2023/06/01/primate-ai-genome-variants/?utm_campaign=wp_the_optimist&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_optimist&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3a2e1f3%2F647c8b64e49da13a6d45e983%2F596bdb5f9bbc0f403f990f33%2F28%2F44%2F647c8b64e49da13a6d45e983)** 

* "The scientists built the algorithm, called PrimateAI-3D, using the genetic blueprints of 233 different primate species. This base brings into sharp relief the variants that can be tolerated by primates, including humans, and those that prove deadly. Scientists look for places where the sequence is the same from one primate to another, a clear sign that any change is disastrous."

* "Illumina said it will make the new tool broadly available in future releases of its software products."

* "By testing the new algorithm on hundreds of thousands of patient genomes in UK Biobank, “we found that 97 percent of the general population carries a rare variant” that has some kind of significant affect on health, Farh said. Although the algorithm cannot account for the influence of diet and environmental factors, he explained,..."

* "The National Institutes of Health estimates that genome sequencing is now generating up to 40 billion gigabytes of data each year, the equivalent of roughly 10 million full genomes."

 **Reminder: Genetics, of course, is unaware of health changes due to:** 

   * supplements, 

   * what you eat, 

   * toxins,

   * exercise, 

   * sleep duration

   * stress level, 

   * pollution, 

   * DNA of your bionome

   * Health of your parents in the year before your birth

   * Your season of birth

   * How often you get outdoors

   * Infection by viruses, such as COVID. that deactivate scores of genes - such as the Vitamin D receptor
