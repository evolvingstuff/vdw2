**Rats got about 1/10 Tesla for 1 hour per day for 5 days** 

 **Vitamin D levels dropped from 22 ng to 14 ng** 

Patients getting MRI receive 0.5-3.0 Tesla for about 1/2 hour, thus about 10X as intense, but perhaps only 1/10 of body

### MRI also used to diagnose:

* [Knee surgery reduced vitamin D by 40 percent in 2 days â€“ May 2011](/posts/knee-surgery-reduced-vitamin-d-by-40-percent-in-2-days) was it the surgery or the MRI which reduced the vitamin D levels?

Passengers in magnetically levitated trains get about 1/20 Tesla (Note: this study, while made in Wisconsin, was published in Japan)
