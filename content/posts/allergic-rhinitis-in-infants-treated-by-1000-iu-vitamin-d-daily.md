Allergic rhinitis is a topic of concern among clinicians. Despite of being treated in form of oral medicines, nasal drops and sprays several patients come back with complaint of no relief. This necessitates to review and focus on etiology and to find some other treatment regimen. Established relation of serum vitamin D level and various allergic conditions attracts us to use it as a therapeutic agent for allergic rhinitis. It is a case–control observational study recruited 80 subjects with 40 cases and 40 controls. There was drop out of two subjects among cases. Cases were supplement with oral vitamin D (cholecalciferol-1000 IU OD) and controls received no treatment. Serum vitamin D level, Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and total eosinophilic count (TEC) were calculated at  **0, 1 and 3 months**  and compared. Pre-treatment average serum vitamin D level of cases was 20.15 + 10.26 ng/ml and of control was 27.94 + 13.38 ng/ml. The TNSS score of cases was 7.43 + 1.87 and of controls was 5.00 + 1.52. TEC of cases was 546.15 + 113.39 and of controls was 313.33 + 125.08. Post-treatment serum vitamin D level of cases was 38.05 + 14.62 and of controls was 27.43 + 12.76. TNSS of cases was 3.53 + 0.68 and 4.43 + 1.17 in control group, TEC of cases was 68.13 + 38.95 and of controls was 197.03 + 123.36. This study concludes that vitamin D acts as disease modulator in allergic rhinitis In case of allergic rhinitis with vitamin D deficiency its supplementation gives symptomatic relief and also lowers down the values of TNSS and TEC.
