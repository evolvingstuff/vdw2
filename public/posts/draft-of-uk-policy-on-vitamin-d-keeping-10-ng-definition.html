It will focus on at-risk groups including infants, children, older people, pregnant and breastfeeding women and those who have limited exposure to the sun.</p></li><li><p>b) This guidance will support a number of related policy and guidance documents including:</p><ul><li><p>&lsquo;Delivering a healthy start for pregnant women, new mums, babies and young children&rsquo; (DH 2011a)</p></li><li><p>&lsquo;Healthy lives, healthy people: our strategy for public health in England&rsquo; (DH 2010)</p></li><li><p>&lsquo;Update on vitamin D&rsquo; (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition 2007)</p></li><li><p>&lsquo;Vitamin D - advice on supplements for at risk groups&rsquo; (Chief Medical Officers 2012).</p></li></ul></li><li><p>c) This guidance will provide recommendations for good practice, based on the best available evidence of effectiveness, including cost effectiveness. It is aimed at commissioners, managers and other professionals with public health as part of their remit working Vitamin D: implementation of existing guidance to prevent deficiency draft scope for consultation within the NHS, local authorities and the wider public, private, voluntary and community sectors. It is also aimed at the suppliers and providers of vitamin D supplements. In addition, it may be of interest to people at risk of vitamin D deficiency, their families and carers and other members of the public.</p></li><li><p>d) The guidance will support NICE guidance on antenatal care, maternal and child nutrition and skin cancer. For further details, see section 6.</p></li></ul><p>This guidance will be developed using the NICE public health guidance process and methods guides.</p><h2 id=3--------the-need-for-guidance>3 The need for guidance</h2><ul><li><p>a) Vitamin D is essential for skeletal growth and bone health. Dietary sources are limited (they include oily fish, egg yolk and fortified margarines, breakfast cereals and infant formula). The major natural source of vitamin D is from skin synthesis following exposure to sunlight. Existing evidence suggests that from October to April in the UK, there is no ambient ultraviolet sunlight of the appropriate wavelength. During this time, the population relies on body stores (gathered during exposure in the summer) and dietary sources to maintain vitamin D levels (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition 2007).</p></li><li><p>b) Severe vitamin D deficiency results in rickets (among children) and osteomalacia (among children and adults). It has also been associated with some diseases and long-term conditions, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and some cancers (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition 2007). There have been reports that rickets is re-emerging among children in the UK (Pearce and Cheetham 2010). The national diet and nutrition survey of British adults (Ruston et al. 2004) suggests that about a quarter of British women aged 19-24, and a sixth of those aged 25-34, are at risk of vitamin D deficiency.</p></li><li><p>c) Vitamin D deficiency can occur during periods of rapid growth, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. A newborn baby&rsquo;s vitamin D status is largely determined by the mother&rsquo;s level of vitamin D. Women and children of South Asian, African, Caribbean and Middle Eastern descent, and those who remain covered when outside, are at greatest risk. Infants who are exclusively breastfed, particularly for more than 6 months, are at increased risk because scope for consultation the amount of vitamin D in breast milk will not meet their requirements. (See NICE guidance on antenatal care and maternal and child nutrition.) Older people are at increased risk because their skin cannot synthesise vitamin D efficiently, they are likely to spend more time indoors and may not have enough dietary vitamin D. Limited sun exposure - for example, among those who are housebound or prisoners - may also increase people&rsquo;s risk (Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition 2007).</p></li><li><p>d) In 1991, the Committee on Medical Aspects of food policy (COMA) set reference nutrient intakes (RNI) for different population groups (DH 1991). In most instances, an intake above the RNI can only be guaranteed by taking a vitamin D supplement. In 2007, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition confirmed that these recommendations should remain unchanged. All UK health departments (Chief Medical Officers 2012) and NICE (see guidance on antenatal care and maternal and child nutrition) have issued evidence-based guidance on vitamin D supplements for various at-risk groups. They have also provided guidance on how to distribute free Healthy Start supplements (which contain vitamin D) to eligible families.</p></li><li><p>e) Health professionals could make &lsquo;a significant difference&rsquo; if they ensure those at risk of vitamin D deficiency understand how important the vitamin is, and how to get a daily supplement. That&rsquo;s the view of the 4 UK Chief Medical Officers. They also stress the need to ensure people who may be eligible for the Healthy Start scheme know how they can apply. All at-risk groups should be made aware of how they can obtain the vitamins locally (Chief Medical Officers 2012). (Note: The Healthy Start scheme includes free formula milk and fruit and vegetables, as well as vitamin supplements.) Evidence suggests implementation of these recommendations has been limited - and uptake of Healthy Start vitamins among families who qualify for the scheme varies markedly across England (Chief Medical Officers 2012; Feeding for Life Foundation 2012; DH: personal communication 2012). The cost effectiveness of implementing existing guidance on vitamin D remains unclear.</p></li><li><p>f) Healthy Start vitamins are usually available from health clinics, children&rsquo;s centres, Sure Start centres, outreach programmes or GP surgeries, although there have been supply problems in the past. Manufacturers have not made them directly available to pharmacies, although this can be arranged locally. (Pharmacies may sell other commercially available supplements containing vitamin D at a higher price.) It is possible for those not eligible for Healthy Start to buy Healthy Start supplements and this has been encouraged in some areas (DH 2011b). They cost 91p for women and £1.80 for children for an 8-week supply. Primary care spending on treatments for vitamin D deficiency rose from £28 million in 2004 to £76 million in 2011 (Robinson 2012; Health and Social Care Information Centre 2012).</p></li></ul><h2 id=4--------the-guidance>4 The guidance</h2><p>Public health guidance will be developed according to NICE processes and methods.
