BACKGROUND: The continuous increase in the US population older than 65 years and the chronic course of psoriasis make management of psoriasis in the elderly an important health care problem.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a treatment algorithm for patients with psoriasis who are older than 65 years.

METHODS: A systematic literature search for studies on elderly patients with psoriasis was performed using MEDLINE.

RESULTS: We summarize the available published data on therapeutic modalities used in the elderly. We suggest a treatment algorithm including topical medications as first-line treatment for limited disease, with phototherapy, systemic retinoids, methotrexate, and biologics as the first-line systemic treatments for patients with more extensive disease. Cyclosporine should only rarely be used as a second-line systemic treatment for extensive disease in elderly patients with psoriasis.

LIMITATIONS: Limited data are available regarding treatment modalities specifically for elderly patients with psoriasis.

CONCLUSION: Appropriate treatment for elderly patients with limited psoriasis includes topical corticosteroids,  **topical vitamin D analogues** , and topical tazarotene. 

For appropriately monitored elderly patients who have psoriasis with extensive disease,  **phototherapy** , acitretin, methotrexate, alefacept, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, and ustekinumab are first-line therapies that can generally be safely used. There remains a need for further research on the management of psoriasis in elderly patients with psoriasis.
