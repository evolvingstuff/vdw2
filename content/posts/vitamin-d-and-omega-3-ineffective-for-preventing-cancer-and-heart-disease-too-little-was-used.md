#### When the VITAL trial was started VitaminDWiki, and many others, predicted  
 that it would be unlikely to find a benefit

 **40 years ago it might have been enough** 

* 2,000 IU of vitamin D might have been enough for some people to get a benefit (that  is, achieve  >30 ng level of vitamin D)

   * But not for overweight, poor gut, dark skin, many seniors, and others who are at high risk of having low levels of vitamin D

   * [Other reasons - avoiding the sun, less cholesterol in diet, more drugs blocking Vit D, increased Roundup, etc.](/posts/many-reasons-why-vitamin-d-deficiency-has-become-epidemic) 

*  **0.84 gram**  of Omega-3 used by VITAL might have produced a benefit before

> but now people consume a lot of Omega-6 (which blocks the benefits of Omega-3)

* There used to be a lot more Magnesium in the diet

#### Comments on the VITAL study

 **Beware of false propaganda against supplements like vitamin D3** 

* described the things wrong with VITAL study - from Norway

> Too short of trial for Cancers, too little vitamin D, too little Omega-3

> "...current study appears as part of the D3 promotional campaign launched by Big Pharma"

There were some negative results that made headlines but there were also a lot of positive results as well. Let's talk about them!

 **[WATCH THE YOUTUBE VIDEO BY CLICKING HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqHiYTOgZxs)** 

* It was an randomized controlled trial involving more than 25,800 people that were randomly assigned to one of four groups: one received 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day and a placebo, another took 1g of omega-3 fatty acids a day with a placebo, a third took both 2,000 IU of vitamin D and 1g of omega-3 a day, and the last group received two daily placebos. All volunteers took their assigned nutrients for approximately five years, and researchers logged everything from cancer diagnoses to major heart events including heart attack and stroke, as well as deaths from cancer and heart disease.

* The large omega-3 and vitamin D trial found no difference between omega-3 and placebo for adverse heart outcomes combined (heart attack + stroke) but it did find that fish oil reduced heart attack risk by 28% and 40% in people with low fish intake compared to placebo. The large omega-3 and vitamin D trial found no difference between omega-3 and placebo for adverse heart outcomes combined but  **it did find that fish oil reduced heart attack risk by 28% and 40% in people with low fish intake**  (less than 1.5 servings per week) compared to placebo. The reduction of heart attack risk among those taking omega-3s was especially pronounced among  **African American participants, with a 77% reduction**  was observed.

* As for vitamin D no effect was found on heart attacks. There was a non-significant difference in reduced cancer rates compared to placebo. However, when the team examined rates after participants had been taking supplements **for at least two years, they found that cancer deaths were significantly reduced by 25 percent among those taking vitamin D** .

* No serious side effects, such as bleeding, high blood calcium levels, or gastrointestinal symptoms were found with either supplement. The two supplements did not appear to interact with each other or have synergistic effects.
