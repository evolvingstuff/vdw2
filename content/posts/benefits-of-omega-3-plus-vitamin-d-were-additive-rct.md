 **2 + 2 = 4** 

 **Expect to find that vitamin D is al least synergistic with Omega-3 for many health problems**

 **Anticipate finding other synergistic combinations, such as:** 

Vitamin D + (Resveratrol or Curcumin or Querctin or Zinc)

Purpose

Psychological distresses and pre-diabetes are among the risk factors of developing type-II diabetes. The present study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of omega-3 and vitamin D co-supplementation on psychological distresses in women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D.

Methods

The present factorial clinical trial was conducted on 168 women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. These participants were selected by stratified random sampling and were assigned to four groups for 8 weeks: group 1 (placebo group), group 2 (omega-3 group), group 3 (vitamin D group), and group 4 (co-supplement group). The medication and placebo doses being two 1000-mg tablets each day for omega-3 and 50,000-IU pearls every 2 weeks for vitamin D. Fasting blood glucose and vitamin D were measured at the beginning of the study. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were completed by the participants at the start and end of the intervention.

Results

A significant difference was observed in terms of reduction in anxiety and improvement in sleep quality in the co-supplementation compared to the other three groups (p < .05). There was also a significant difference between the group receiving both supplements and the group receiving only placebos in terms of reduction in depression and stress (p < .05).

Conclusion

Vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation improved depression, anxiety, and sleep quality in women of reproductive age with pre-diabetes and hypovitaminosis D. Therefore, these two supplements can be recommended for improving the mental health of this group of women.
