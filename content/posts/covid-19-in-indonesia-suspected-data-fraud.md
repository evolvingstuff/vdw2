#### Introduction

The authors see sufficient scientific plausibility that with a good vitamin D level, many corona deaths could still be alive today.<span style="color:<span style="color">#000000">The studies listed wrt the course of the disease, and the death rate in Covid-19 infections dependent on vitamin D level are evident, among others, in a study with 780 participants. That may be a factor of 12 smaller than a placebo-controlled double-blind study with 10,000 participants. The study is still significant because it shows that infections in groups with deficient vitamin D levels are 10 times more likely to end in death. <span style="color:#000000;">With a vitamin D supplementation to levels known from nature (East Africa: Massai/Hadza, Central Africa: wild chimpanzees) of 45 ng/ml, there is a good chance that Covid-19 would not have any worse effects than a severe wave of influenza. A lockdown would then be just as unnecessary as the justified fear of our elderly fellow citizens and the risk groups, which imposes an abnormal life on all of us. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Quite independently of Corona, it has been known and published for many years that vitamin D deficiency promotes the development of pneumonia - technically correct from ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Symptom) - as a result of viral infections. In addition, vitamin D stimulates the body's own synthesis of antiviral substances, which specifically block the spike protein necessary for the docking mechanism of covid-19 to the receptor protein ACE2. All this is well-researched, published information that clearly shows us that vitamin D deficiency patients are at high risk of getting pneumonia. </span>In today's society, many people suffer from a massive vitamin D deficiency - especially in winter (see chapter: What else you should know <span>[WHO vs. D-A- CH limits]</span>). <span style="color:#000000;">Statistics often assume that blood values of 20ng/ml are sufficient for vitamin D function. But these limits date back to the time when vitamin D was only studied for its effect on bone metabolism. The fact is - and studies in many European countries show this - that depending on the country, 20-40% of people do not even reach this value (20 ng/ml) even in summer. One reason for this is the recommendations for vitamin D substitution. It has been published for years that the official recommendations of 400-800 units of vitamin D per day are based on a calculation error by a factor of 10. Unfortunately, this has still not been included in the official recommendations, as they should be in the range of 5,000 international units per day. Necessary for a stable immune system are blood values of 40- 50ng/ml. But only a few people have reached this level.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The data presented in this article show that up to 90% of deaths could be avoided. This means that the current situation could also be symbolically described as a "vitamin D deficiency pandemic." Unfortunately, in Germany, neither the family doctor nor hospitalized patients routinely measure the blood level of vitamin D, even though all relevant organisati­ons, such as the DGE, BfR, RKI, and WHO, repeatedly report that our population suffers from vitamin D deficiency that also causes other health problems. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The present study from Indonesia shows exactly the result that must be expected based on the scientific background described above. At vitamin D concentrations below 20 ng/ml, a very large number of patients succumb to pneumonia triggered by Covid-19, whereas at vitamin D concentrations >30 ng/ml, the majority of patients survive, and this with a statistically very good correlation. </span>Large medical studies are very expensive. Someone has to raise the necessary funds in the hope that there will be revenue if the results are positive. Given the low market price of vitamin D, this simple economic constraint explains why there are relatively few studies on vitamin D. Lorenz Borsche has been trying for a few weeks now to find partners in the medical field in Germany who, with his financial support, carry out purely observational ex-post studies (vitamin D testing of infected persons/course of the disease), unfortunately without any success so far. The three studies presented here were initiated by ordinary doctors (MD/GP) and financed from their own resources and with considerable personal commitment<sup>(</sup><sup>[1]</sup><sup>}</sup>. One must, therefore, not apply the same standard as in large-scale double-blind studies. Nevertheless, the results are so overwhelmingly clear that they should be examined. <span style="color:#000000;">The rapid increase of vitamin D levels in covid-19 infected patients with vitamin D deficiency (< 30ng/ml), as well as vitamin D supplementation in doctors, nursing staff, and risk patients to a healthy blood level of 40-50ng/ml, is - in the authors' view - the only conceivable solution to effectively contain the corona pandemic. One then could most likely allow the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread, and people could survive the infection like a wave of influenza. Apart from the social and economic benefits, this would also be much more economical than any other measure and might cost a fraction of what the lockdown has cost and will cost us - in money and in human lives.</span>#000000: **''

#### The latest studies on Covid-19 and vitamin D

2 May, the authors received a [publication from Indonesia](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3585561). Prabowo Raharusuna and his team examined 780 covid-19 patients for their vitamin D levels. This study is neutral and independent; it was neither sponsored nor has any other conflicts of interest.~~** The result: Depressingly clear!<span style="color:
~~__The result;">After correction for age, sex, and previous illnesses, the risk of death is 10 times higher for people with vitamin D deficiency. Insufficient vitamin D status is still 7 times higher than sufficient, good vitamin D levels. </span><span style="color:#000000;">In order to make the evaluation transparent and easy to interpret even for non-scientists, Sadiah Priambada, a statistician in the team, prepared the data in such a way that the three comparison groups with vitamin D levels of <20, 20-30, and >30 ng/ml can be assessed on the basis of an equal age average and an equal number of cases. This more easily readable evaluation leads to practically the same results as the original data, which proves not only the stability of the data but also the correctness of the previously chosen statistical approach to the calculation of the influencing factors of age, sex, and previous fluctuations.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The authors could not standardize the comorbidity (pre-existing conditions); too few cases would have remained. One should, therefore, not compare the percentage of deaths and attribute everything to vitamin D, as this would result in too high a ratio, here about 30:1 instead of 10:1. Every simplification has its limits. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The data show that pre-existing conditions have an influence on the course of infections. It is not possible to say with certainty to what extent the Covid-19 infection or the previous illness is responsible for the occurrence of death. However, the available data suggest that the mortality rate is significantly lower even in the presence of pre-existing conditions when vitamin D levels are sufficient. Whether pre-existing conditions may also result from decades of vitamin D deficiency will have to be proven in future studies. </span>The  **o** ri **ginal data** (table, 780 cases) is available[here as PDF ](https://borsche.de/res/Indo_1.pdf)with detailed explanations of the  **data reduction** and  **comments** by  **Sadiah P** r **iambada** . There is also the contact of the zero line below at approx. 34 ng/ml is explained, what it is based on, and what it means.

<span style="color:#000000;">The above graph clearly shows the dependence of the death rate in hospitalized Covid-19 infected patients on the measured vitamin D concentration in the blood. The data are based on the same data reduction as the above table but with finer granulation - in 20 groups. The procedure is the same as explained in the PDF above; the same data set was used. </span> **There is a very sha** r **p d** r **op in the death rate in the range of b** l **ood levels between 27 and 32 ng/ml vitamin D (ma** r **ked area)** . At vitamin D levels above 32 ng/ml, the death rate determined in this study is a factor of 10 lower than at vitamin D levels below 27 ng/ml. <span style="color:#000000;">What else you should know (WHO vs. D-A-CH limits): </span><span style="color:#000000;">The Indonesians use the international guidelines of the WHO for the vitamin D level: 20 ng/ml is already considered "deficient," i.e., a deficiency, 20-30 is "insufficient," i.e., insufficient, and only more than 30 ng/ml is considered "normal." In Germany, outdated and significantly lower values apply: Above 20 ng/ml is already "normal," 10-20 ng/ml is borderline, and only below 10 ng/ml is a deficiency worthy of treatment established. In most cases, however, this is not treated because far too few tests are carried out. The test has to be paid for by the patient himself and is in the order of 30 Euros. </span>German healthy seniors have over 80% "German" normal values, i.e., more than 20 ng/ml. 80% of sick seniors (geriatric patients), on the other hand, have insufficient, and half of them values, which even in Germany are classified as  **deficiency** (<10 ng/ml, among others [s here)](https://www.heise.de/tp/features/Schuetzt-Vitamin-D-vor-Covid-19-4704193.html). From the data of the RKI [(Vitamin D status in Germany](https://T1p.de/2jde), p.36, 2016), it can be calculated that  **30%**  **of** all Germans between 18 and 79 must have far less than 10 ng/ml in the winter quarter (Dec/Feb):

<span style="color:#000000;">The data can be summarised as follows (abstract translated). </span><span style="color:#000000;">For each increase by one standard deviation of serum 25(OH)D, the probability of a mild clinical outcome instead of a severe one was approximately 7.94 times (OR = 0.126, p <0.001), while interestingly, the chances of a critical outcome instead of a mild one were 19.61 times higher (OR = 0.051, p <0.001). </span><span style="color:#000000;">The following vitamin D levels were used: </span><span style="color:#000000;">The mean serum vitamin D level was 23.8 ng/ml. Serum vitamin D levels in mild cases were 31.2 ng/ml, 27.4 ng/ml for normal, 21.2 ng/ml for severe, and 17.1 ng/ml for critical. </span><span style="color:#000000;">From the available data, it follows that only 4.3% of the patients who had a mild course had vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml. In contrast, 95.8% of the patients with vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml had a severe or even fatal course. Unfortunately, no further data, such as age and BMI, were collected. </span><span style="color:#000000;">In Germany, the average vitamin D level over the year is only 18.8 ng/ml. Seniors with comorbidities are almost half that level and often even below 10 ng/ml, especially in winter. According to the available studies, it follows that especially our elderly fellow citizens do not have sufficient protection against Covid-19 infections. Conversely, the data suggest that the vast majority of Covid-19 patients with vitamin D levels above 30 ng/ml would survive the infection unscathed. </span><span style="color:#000000;">At this point, it should be noted that nature has provided humans with a vitamin D level in the range of 45 ng/ml. This results from the values measured in primitive peoples (Massai/Hadza). Many people nowadays do not reach this value due to our modern lifestyle, especially since we hardly ever move unprotected in the sun at the relevant times of the day. </span><span style="color:#000000;">In case anyone wonders why even the Filipino patients examined do not have more than 24 ng/ml vitamin D on average when there is much more sunshine? That's exactly why it is so hot there that they usually avoid the sun. This is a bit like the situation in nursing homes, except that in this country, there is too little sunshine instead of too much, and the senior citizens stay indoors because it is cold.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">A study from England also fits the picture:</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The Role of Vitamin D in the Prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection and Mortality</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The researchers around Petre Cristian Ilie have tested the number of Covid-19 deaths per 1 million inhabitants against the vitamin D level in 20 European countries and come to the following conclusion:</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The mean vitamin D level in the countries studied (mean 22.4 ng/ml, StDev ±4.24) correlates strictly with the number of Covid-19 infected per million population (mean 295.95, StDev ±298.73, p=0.004) and with mortality (mean 5.96, StDev 15.13,</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">p<0.00001)</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">The death rates in Spain and Italy are much higher than in Scandinavia. The researchers explain this with the statistically significant higher vitamin D level among the inhabitants of the Nordic countries: </span><span style="color:#000000;">The study shows that in older people, the average blood vitamin D level in Spain is 10.4 ng/ml, in Italy, 11.2 ng/ml, while in the Scandinavian countries, it is 18 ng/ml. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The northerners obviously have a better vitamin D level, although the sun is not as intense there as in the south. This could either be because they are more active outdoors or because they get more vitamin D from food, e.g., fish, or both. Fat sea fish contains a lot of vitamin D., And southerners tend to spend their midday hours in the shade or indoors. Shadow, window glass, and a longer way through the atmosphere (morning/evening, autumn/spring) reduce UVB radiation much more than UVA.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Another study from the USA (2016) shows that high supplementation with vitamin D can still help even after the emergency has already occurred, i.e., in patients who need to be ventilated. </span><span style="color:#000000;">High dose vitamin D administration in ventilated intensive care unit patients: A pilot double-blind randomized controlled trial</span><span style="color:#000000;">In the study, patients with vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/ml) were divided into three groups: A placebo group and two groups that were given different doses of vitamin D. The single administration of 250,000 IU of vitamin D was compared with the single administration of 500,000 IU of vitamin D by injection. In addition, the vitamin D levels were increased to 45 and 55 ng/ml, respectively. While the length of stay of the placebo group at the ICU was 36 days, the 250,000 IU group averaged 25 days, and the 500,000 IU group averaged 18 days. This is a smooth halving and means that vitamin D is useful in prevention and acute cases. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Another very recent study is by El James Glicio, a retired general practitioner and author from New Delhi:</span>[Vitamin D Level of Mild and Severe Elderly Cases of COVID-19“](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3593258). <span style="color:#000000;">Although the study is relatively small, it provides comparable results. Most (84.6%) of COVID-19 patients with critical course had vitamin D deficiency. Among those under 75 years of age, this was even 100% of critical cases. </span><span style="color:#000000;">In the following figure, the data are divided according to the international vitamin D level groupings (<20: deficiency, 20-30: insufficient, >30 sufficient/good). </span><span style="color:#000000;">One can see very clearly that the severe cases are mostly due to vitamin D deficiency. In mild cases, patients with good vitamin D levels predominate. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Finally, a small study in ventilated patients from Iran 2018:</span>Effect of High-Dose Vitamin D on Duration of Mechanical Ventilation in ICU Patients [(MirMohammad Miri et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31531088))

The intervention<span style="color:#000000;">was carried out intramuscularly with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. Instead of 28 days, only 18 days mechanical ventilation, instead of 29, only 19 in ICU, instead of 61% deaths, only 36%.</span><span style="color:#000000;">__.'' </span>

#### 'What we could do

To sum it all up: If all people, especially the seniors, had a vitamin D level significantly above 30 ng/ml rather than 40 ng/ml, there would be a high probability that we would not have to fear Covid-19. At 45 ng/ml, as found in native, traditional living peoples near the equator, we should hope to lose practically no one because of Covid-19 unless the comorbidities are so severe that it would have been a matter of days or weeks anyway. <span style="color:#000000;">From the Indonesian study with 780 participants, it follows that the risk of death would only be 1/10 if all of them had vitamin D levels of just over 30 ng/ml. Whether there would have been any deaths at all at 45 ng/ml is difficult to answer; the highest measured value was below 34 ng/ml. There were no deaths despite hospitalization above 33 ng/ml (only women, all without comorbidities). </span><span style="color:#000000;">From the Philippine study, it follows that people with poor vitamin D levels have an 8 times higher risk of having a "critical" course. So that is the same again. The Iranian "ventilator study" shows a reduction of mortality under artificial respiration by half when vitamin D is administered intramuscularly with 300,000 IU. The American study sees reduced time spent in intensive care units from 36 to 18 days at 500,000 IU. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Only every tenth person is still on intensive care, half of which can be saved with high-dose Vitamin D. A lethality rate of 2-4% currently assumed would result in 0.1-0.2% or less, a figure that even severe flu would reach (2018: 25,000 deaths among perhaps 15­20 million infected persons). </span><span style="color:#000000;">Apart from this, it is highly plausible that people with comorbidities would also benefit significantly from a better D-level, indeed the entire population as a whole.</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, the above studies suggest that a corresponding high-dose intervention would be indicated at the time of hospitalization, not at the time of transfer to the ICU. Which could save even more lives and turn severe courses into mild ones.</span>

 **[** And how much does  **]** it cost? <span style="color:#000000;">For a healthy level of more than 45 ng/ml at 70 kg body weight, 5,000 IU vitamin D3 + 200 mcg of vitamin K2, which costs about 7 cents per day, is sufficient. The authors explicitly state that each vitamin D supplementation must be accompanied by sufficient vitamin K2. This certainly prevents the rise of the calcium level in the blood, which is often seen as a risk for the supply of vitamin For</span><span style="color:#000000;">people who are not infected with Covid-19, e.g., hospital staff and high-risk patients, corresponding studies show that the vitamin D level can be raised relatively quickly to the "healthy" range if two to three times the amount is administered for two to three weeks (10,000 - 20,000 IU depending on weight). In Covid-19 patients who are hospitalized, the level can be raised immediately to sufficient values with the 500,000 IU syringe mentioned above. </span><span style="color:#000000;">From the authors' point of view, this should mean that we no longer need another partial lockdown or special protective measures. The Covid 19 pandemic would continue, but we could safely wait until herd immunity is established if vaccination is unavailable first. In addition, we would save many billions in costs and avoid social disruption. </span><span style="color:#000000;">These assumptions are supported by the clinical studies listed and published basic studies: They investigated how and where vitamin D intervenes in the relevant metabolic pathways. Without going into too much detail, the so-called renin/angiotensin system (RAS) is particularly important. The misregulation of this system in vitamin D deficiency contributes decisively to the development of ARDS and the triggering of a cytokine storm. </span><span style="color:#000000;">A very good summary with quotations from important publications has been compiled by Dr. Renu Mahtani, an American physician of Indian descent (see especially the second half of the lecture). She impressively proves that a sufficient supply of vitamin D is sufficient to keep Covid-19 largely in check. It should be noted that Mrs. Mahtani does not mention the parallel supply of vitamin K2, which is absolutely necessary in the authors' view, when supplementing with vitamin D.</span><span style="color:#000000;">Since 20.5.2020, the Red Cross of Poona has been distributing vitamin D3 to senior citizens "in an effort to boost their immunity" according to Dr. Mahtani's protocol.</span>[Here is the link ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WzUBa3ie7-mBuUzszH0HqaP0238U5xve/view?usp=drive_web)to Renu Mahtani's very convincing presentation (in English)<span style="color:#000000;">__ </span>

#### <span style="color:#000000;">Afterword</span>

<span style="color:#000000;">It is undisputed that Germany and many other countries have prevented many Covid-19 infections and, thus, many deaths through their measures. </span><span style="color:#000000;">How many more people could have been saved if the information on vitamin D presented here had been known and implemented? Could we perhaps even have avoided the lockdown with all its consequences for our economy and social interaction? The authors have great hopes that this article will help ensure that vitamin D will, in the future, have the place it deserves in treating Covid-19 infections and that we can at least prevent the "second wave" that is already on everyone's lips about it.</span><span style="color:#000000;">Heidelberg/Tubingen, Lorenz Borsche, Dr. Bernd Glauner, May 2020</span> **[** Author's info: **]** <span style="color: ;background-color:#FFFFFF;"></span> ,#FFFFFF: **Dr. Bernd Glauner** studied biochemistry in Tubingen and, after a phase as an independent software developer, was responsible for the development and worldwide distribution of the cell counting device "CASY" for many years - first at 'Scharfe System', then at 'Innovatis' and 'Roche' and finally at 'OMNI Life Science.'
