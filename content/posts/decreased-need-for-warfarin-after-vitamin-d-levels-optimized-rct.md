Despite the known role of vitamin D deficiency in development of thrombosis, no studies have evaluated the impact of treating of vitamin D deficiency on the markers of thrombosis. A pilot randomized clinical trial was done on 40 vitamin D-deficient patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The intervention group received an oral dose of 50,000 IU vitamin D3 every week for 8 weeks, followed by 1 pearl every 2 weeks for 4 weeks (a total of 3 months), while the control group did not receive vitamin D. Then, P-selectin and hs-CRP were measured at baseline and 1 and 3 months after the intervention. 

There was no significant decrease in hs-CRP in either group after 1 month (P = .955) or after 3 months (P = .525). 

Likewise, there was no significant decrease in P-selectin between the 2 groups after 1 month (P = .921) or 3 months (P = .795). 

The results indicated that treatment of vitamin D deficiency had no significant effect on hs-CRP or P-selectin after 3 months among DVT/PE patients. 

However, treatment of vitamin D deficiency in these patients resulted in the control of the international normalized ratio (INR) with the lower doses of warfarin. 

This observation is the first clinical report of enhancement of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin by the supplementing of vitamin D. Larger trials are needed to clearly show the effect of treating of vitamin D deficiency on thrombosis.

* “Thromboembolisms affect approximately 900,000 people and are responsible for up to 100,000 American deaths each year in the treatments for thromboembolisms involve anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin or vasodilators.”

* “Research has found that vitamin D deficiency is extremely prevalent among patients with thrombosis. In fact, research suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease.”
