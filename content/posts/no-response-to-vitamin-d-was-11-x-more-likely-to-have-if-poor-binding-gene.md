#### Variability in response to vitamin D supplementation according to vitamin D metabolism related gene polymorphisms in healthy adults

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of polymorphisms in some key gene actors of the vitamin D (vitD) metabolic pathway on supplementation efficacy.

Methods

In total, 245 healthy participants were recruited from occupational medicine service in Sahloul University Hospital with vitD deficiency [25(OH)D ≤ 30 ng/ml](25(OH)D ≤ 30 ng/ml). After giving an informed consent, all participants were asked to complete a generalized questionnaire and to follow a detailed personalized supplementation protocol. Genetic study was performed by PCR-RFLP for 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonging to DBP, CYP2R1, CYP27B14, CYP24A1 and VDR genes. Statistical study was carried out with SPSS23.0.

Results

Among the studied SNPs, non-response was significantly associated with variant alleles of

* rs4588 (OR* = 11.51; p < 0.001), 

* rs10766197 (OR* = 6.92; p = 0.008) and 

* rs12794714 (OR* = 5.09; p = 0.004). 

These three SNPs contributed in 18.8% in response variability with rs4588 being the most influential (10.3%). There was a significant linear negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D and post supplementation 25(OH)D concentration (r = −0.437; p < 0.001) as well as a linear negative association between the increase in 25(OH)D concentration and GRS (GRS: genetic risk score = the sum of risk alleles) (r = −0.149; p = 0.033).

Conclusions

DBP-rs4588, CYP2R1-rs10766197 and (CYP2R1)-rs12794714 variants are associated with variations in serum 25(OH)D concentrations and efficacy of response to vitD supplementation in Tunisian adults. Taking into account these variations can help to better adapt vitD intake to ensure a higher response to supplementation.
