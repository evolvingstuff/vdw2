#### Observations by VitaminDWiki

1. Vitamin D has a half life measured in weeks( vs days or months), so it is not surprising that blood levels of vitamin D decreased three weeks after getting a single dose.

1. If a person is taking such a low dose of vitamin D that they need a 50,000 IU does less than once every 2 weeks they can just add the vitamin D powder to food consumed over a weeks of so – example – adding it to jam, fruit juice, . . .
