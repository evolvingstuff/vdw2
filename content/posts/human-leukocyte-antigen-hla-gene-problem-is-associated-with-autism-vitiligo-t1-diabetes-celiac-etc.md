#### Inheritance of HLA-Cw7 Associated With Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) – Sept 2019

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined disorder that is now thought to affect approximately 1 in 69 children in the United States. In most cases, the etiology is unknown, but several studies point to the interaction of genetic predisposition with environmental factors. The immune system is thought to have a causative role in ASD, and specific studies have implicated T lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and certain cytokines. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is involved in the underlying process for shaping an individual’s immune system, and specific HLA alleles are associated with specific diseases as risk factors. In this study, we determine whether a specific HLA allele was associated with ASD in a large cohort of patients with ASD. Identifying such an association could help in the identification of immune system components which may have a causative role in specific cohorts of patients with ASD who share similar specific clinical features. Specimens from 143 patients with ASD were analyzed with respect to race and ethnicity. Overall, HLA-Cw7 was present in a much greater frequency than expected in individuals with ASD as compared to the general population. Further, the cohort of patients who express HLA-Cw7 shares specific immune system/inflammatory clinical features including being more likely to have allergies, food intolerances, and chronic sinusitis as compared to those with ASD who did not express HLA-Cw7. HLA-Cw7 has a role in stimulating NK cells. Thus, this finding may indicate that chronic over-activation of NK cells may have a role in the manifestation of ASD in a cohort of patients with increased immune system/inflammatory features.

#### HLA-B and Autism in Thailand – 2017

 **Significant Association of HLA-B Alleles and Genotypes in Thai Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Case-Control Study** 

Disease Markers, Volume 2015, Article ID 724935, 7 pages. http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/724935  FREE PDF 

Apichaya Puangpetch,1,2 Pongwut Suwannarat,1,2 Montri Chamnanphol,1,2 Napatrupron Koomdee,1,2 Nattawat Ngamsamut,3 Penkhae Limsila,3 and Chonlaphat Sukasem1,2

Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Many susceptible causative genes have been identified. Most of the previous reports showed the relationship between the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene and etiology of autism. In order to identify HLA-B alleles associated with autism in Thai population, we compared the frequency of HLA-B allele in 364 autistic subjects with 952 normal subjects by using a two-stage sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe system (PCR-SSOP) method based on flow- cytometry technology. HLA-B'13:02 (P = 0.019, OR = 2.229), HLA-B'38:02 (P = 0.049, OR = 1.628), HLA-B'44:03 (P = 0.016, OR = 1.645), and HLA-B'56:01 (P = 1.78 x 10-4, OR = 4.927) alleles were significantly increased in autistic subjects compared with normal subjects. Moreover, we found that the HLA-B' 18:02 (P = 0.016, OR = 0.375) and HLA-B'46:12 (P = 0.008, OR = 0.147) alleles were negatively associated with autism when compared to normal controls. Both alleles might have a protective role in disease development. In addition, four HLA-B genotypes of autistic patients had statistically significant relationship with control groups, consisting of HLA-B'3905/'5801 (P = 0.032, OR = 24.697), HLA-B'2704/'5801 (P = 0.022, OR = 6.872), HLA-B'3501/'4403 (P = 0.021, OR = 30.269), and HLA-B' 1801/'4402 (P = 0.017, OR = 13.757). This is the first report on HLA-B associated with Thai autism and may serve as a marker for genetic susceptibility to autism in Thai population.
