Objective: The objective of the study was to examine changes of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) and PTH blood levels 4 and 20 wk after low-calorie diet-induced weight loss.

Methods: Forty-four obese women [aged 40.6 ± 11.4 yr, body mass index (BMI) 36.7 ± 4.9 kg/m2](aged%2040.6%20±%2011.4%20yr,%20body%20mass%20index%20(BMI)%2036.7%20±%204.9%20kg/m2) and 25 controls (BMI 22.9 ± 1.5 kg/m2) were examined. Anthropometric and cardiometabolic parameters and 25OHD and PTH levels were determined at baseline and 4 and 20 wk after a low-calorie diet.

Results: At baseline, 25OHD levels were lower in obese compared with control subjects (17 ± 6.0 vs. 23.8 ± 8.7 ng/ml, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were found in PTH levels. In all women, a negative correlation was found between 25OHD levels and body weight (BW) (r –0.32, P < 0.001), BMI (r –0.37, P < 0.001), waist circumference (r –0.26, P < 0.05), and percent fat mass (r –0.38, P = 0.001) as determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. 

The  **4-wk low-calorie diet**  (n = 37) reduced BW and led to significant improvements in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and lipid levels. 

The  **20-wk low-calorie diet**  (n = 26) resulted in reduction of BW and BMI by 10%, HOMA index (4.7 ± 3.8 vs. 3.10 ± 1.7, P < 0.01), and lipids levels (except high density lipoprotein cholesterol) and increase in 25OHD (15.4 ± 6.0 vs. 18.3 ± 5.1 ng/ml, P < 0.05), compared with baseline. PTH levels were unchanged. The increase of 25OHD levels was associated with the reduction of insulin levels and HOMA index (r –0.43, P < 0.05).

Conclusions: Blood 25OHD levels were low in obese women and correlated inversely with severity measures of obesity.  **Weight loss of 10% after low-calorie diet increased 25OHD levels, and this increase was mainly associated with improvement of insulin resistance.**
