The vitamin D receptor system is widely expressed in the human body, including immune system cells and epithelial cells (1). The enzyme responsible for the second hydroxylation step in the production of active vitamin D, 1alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp27B), is not just expressed in the kidneys, as previously thought (2). 

Primary lung epithelial cells have been shown to activate vitamin D (3). The focus of recent vitamin D research has been to test the effect of the active form of vitamin D in vitro (4-6) and this has led to increased knowledge about the role of active vitamin D in the immune system and in antimicrobial defence. The picture that has emerged from studies strongly suggests that active vitamin D has an important function in regulating inflammation and infection, including in cystic fibrosis (5-6).
