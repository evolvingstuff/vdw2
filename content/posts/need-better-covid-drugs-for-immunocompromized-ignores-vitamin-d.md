#### More on Mutant SARS-CoV-2:  Evade Pfizer’s Paxlovid & Gilead’s Remdesivir & Need for Better Drugs for Immunocompromised

 **[TrailSiteNews](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/more-on-mutant-sars-cov-2-evade-pfizers-paxlovid-gileads-remdesivir-need-for-better-drugs-for-immunocompromised-4704530b)** 

* "While people with working immune systems can typically clear SARS-CoV-2 within days, those who are immunocompromised may continue to harbor and  **shed the virus for longer, even without symptoms. They also often receive multiple antiviral treatments over time, which may lead to the emergence of drug-resistant variants.**  This represents a big problem for society as they can become places for the virus to mutate and grow and spread."
