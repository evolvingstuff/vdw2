#### Is Sunlight Exposure Enough to Avoid Wintertime Vitamin D Deficiency in United Kingdom Population Groups?

Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2018 Aug 1;15(8). pii: E1624. [doi: 10.3390/ijerph15081624.](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15081624.)

 **The UK government continues to mistakenly believe that <span style="color:#F00;">10 ng</span> is enough** 

 **Most of the rest of the world believes than at least <span style="color:#F00;">30 ng</span> is needed** 

* [Is 50 ng of vitamin D too high, just right, or not enough](/posts/is-50-ng-of-vitamin-d-too-high-just-right-or-not-enough)

Note a major mistake in the study.

They used UVR sensors which most liekly measure the total of UVA + UVB

Only UVB generates Vitamin D in the skin.

UVA greatly exceeds UVB after about 3PM, when a high UVR reading generates no Vitamin D.

Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is required for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, and experimental studies have indicated the levels of sun exposure required to avoid a vitamin D deficient status. Our objectives are to examine the sun exposure behaviours of different United Kingdom sectors and to identify if their exposure is enough to maintain winter circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D above deficiency (>25 nmol/L). Data are from a series of human studies involving >500 volunteers and performed using the same protocols in Greater Manchester, UK (53.5° N) in healthy white Caucasian adolescents and working-age adults (skin type I⁻IV), healthy South Asian working-age adults (skin type V), and adults with photodermatoses (skin conditions caused or aggravated by cutaneous sun exposure). Long-term monitoring of the spectral ambient UVR of the Manchester metropolitan area facilitates data interpretation. The healthy white populations are exposed to 3% ambient UVR, contrasting with ~1% in South Asians. South Asians and those with photodermatoses wear clothing exposing smaller skin surface area, and South Asians have the lowest oral vitamin D intake of all groups. Sun exposure levels prevent winter vitamin D deficiency in 95% of healthy white adults and 83% of adolescents, while 32% of the photodermatoses group and >90% of the healthy South Asians were deficient. The latter require increased oral vitamin D, whilst their sun exposure provides a tangible contribution and might convey other health benefits.
