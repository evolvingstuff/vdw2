Epidemiological studies suggest that serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels are inversely related to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cuban-Americans have a high prevalence of diabetes despite residing in a solar rich environment. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of vitamin D with diabetes status in Cuban-Americans residing in South Florida. Serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels (nmol/L), vitamin D intake and BMI were measured in 112 subjects with T2D and 71 controls. Subjects with diabetes had lower serum vitamin D levels (65.9±20.0) as compare to subjects without diabetes (95.0±29.2) (p<.001). However, vitamin D intake (IU) was higher in subjects with diabetes (496.1±365.3) than subjects without diabetes (391.3±302.3) (p<.05). After adjusting for age, gender, BMI and vitamin D intake, the relationship was still significant (p=0.002) between low serum vitamin D levels and T2D. Prevalence of suboptimal serum 25-OH-vitamin D (< 75 nmol/L) was more common in subjects with diabetes as compared to controls (75% vs. 23%). Based on our results we conclude that Cuban-Americans with diabetes have low 25-OH-vitamin D levels despite residing in region with abundant sunshine and higher vitamin D intake. This warrants for prospective studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the inverse association between vitamin D levels and T2D. Supported by a grant from NIH/SCORE.
