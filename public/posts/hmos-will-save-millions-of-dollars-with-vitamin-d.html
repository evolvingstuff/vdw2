Most HMOs today do not fit neatly into one form; they can have multiple divisions, each operating under a different model, or blend two or more models together.</p><p>In the <strong>staff model</strong> , physicians are salaried and have offices in HMO buildings. In this case, physicians are direct employees of the HMOs. This model is an example of a closed-panel HMO, meaning that contracted physicians may only see HMO patients. Previously this type of HMO was common, although currently it is nearly inactive.<sup>[5]</sup></p><p>In the <strong>group model</strong> , the HMO does not employ the physicians directly, but contracts with a multi-specialty physician group practice. Individual physicians are employed by the group practice, rather than by the HMO. The group practice may be established by the HMO and only serve HMO members (&ldquo;captive group model&rdquo;). Kaiser Permanente is an example of a captive group model HMO rather than a staff model HMO, as is commonly believed. An HMO may also contract with an existing, independent group practice (&ldquo;independent group model&rdquo;), which will generally continue to treat non-HMO patients. Group model HMOs are also considered closed-panel, because doctors must be part of the group practice to participate in the HMO - the HMO panel is closed to other physicians in the community.<sup>[6]</sup></p><p>If not already part of a group medical practice, physicians may contract with an independent practice association (IPA), which in turn contracts with the HMO.</p><p>This model is an example of an open-panel HMO, where a physician may maintain their own office and may see non-HMO members.</p><p>In the <strong>network model,</strong> an HMO will contract with any combination of groups, IPAs (Independent Practice Associations), and individual physicians.</p><p>Since 1990, most HMOs run by managed care organizations with other lines of business (such as PPO, POS and indemnity) use the network model.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/bone.html><span class=tag>bone</span></a>
