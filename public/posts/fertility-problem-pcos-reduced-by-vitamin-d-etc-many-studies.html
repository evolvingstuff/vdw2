To date, numerous researchers have found that fertility nutrient supplements may benefit female reproductive health, but their direct impact on polycystic ovary syndrome risk remains unclear.</p><p>Methods: Our research employs Mendelian Randomization to assess how fertility nutrients affect PCOS risk. Initially, we reviewed 49 nutrients and focused on 10: <strong>omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, dehydroepiandrosterone, vitamin D, betaine, D-Inositol, berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, and metformin.</strong> Using methodologies of Inverse Variance Weighting and Mendelian Randomization-Egger regression, we examined their potential causal relationships with PCOS risk.</p><p>Results: Our findings indicate omega-3 fatty acids reduced PCOS risk (OR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.94, P=0.016), whereas betaine increased it (OR=2.60, 95% CI: 1.09-6.17, P=0.031). No definitive causal relations were observed for calcium, dehydroepiandrosterone, vitamin D, D-Inositol, and metformin (P>0.05). Drug target Mendelian Randomization analysis suggested that increased expression of the berberine target gene BIRC5 in various tissues may raise PCOS risk (OR: 3.00-4.88; P: 0.014-0.018), while elevated expressions of curcumin target gene CBR1 in Stomach and epigallocatechin gallate target gene AHR in Adrenal Gland were associated with reduced PCOS risk (OR=0.48, P=0.048; OR=0.02, P=0.018, respectively).</p><p>Conclusions: Our research reveals that specific fertility nutrients supplementation, such as omega-3 fatty acids, berberine, and curcumin, may reduce the risk of PCOS by improving metabolic and reproductive abnormalities associated with it.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/pcos-mendelian-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=pcos-treatment-needs-about-3000-iu-of-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-sept-2024>PCOS treatment needs about 3,000 IU of Vitamin D - meta-analysis Sept 2024</h4><p>Optimizing vitamin D status in polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis</p><p>Nutr Rev. 2024 Sep 1;82(9):1176-1186. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuad117>doi: 10.1093/nutrit/nuad117</a> PDF behind paywall</p><p>Kelsey M Cochrane 1 2, Jeffrey N Bone 2 3, Brock A Williams 1 2, Crystal D Karakochuk 1 2</p><p>Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age.

<img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/pcos-ovarian.jpg alt=image width=800><p>Recent literature has stressed the importance of vitamin D (VD) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS are deficient in VD, particularly those with a higher weight. Hypovitaminosis is a risk factor for glucose intolerance, and reduced levels of VD is associated with insulin resistance and increased diabetes risk. Since women with PCOS and hirsutism seem to have lower levels of VD than women with PCOS without hirsutism, a correlation between VD deficiency and hyperandrogenism may be suggested. Interestingly, VD is crucial for many human physiological functions, including to counteract inflammation and oxidative stress. Some studies evaluated effects of VD supplementation on glucose homeostasis variables, hormonal status, lipid concentrations, and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress among VD-deficient women. Moreover, VD has been shown to play a role in egg quality and fertility. This review aims to show the relationship between VD and the endocrine and metabolic profile of PCOS patients, as well as its implications for their fertility. The supplement of VD to the common therapy can lead to an improvement of the insulin resistance and lipid metabolism, a reduction of circulating androgens, as well as a better response to the induction of ovulation in PCOS women.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/pcos-physiopathology-and-vitamin-d-deficiency-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=pcos---menstrual-frequency-improved-by-50000-iu-vitamin-dweek--low-calorie-diet---rct-may-2018>PCOS - menstrual frequency improved by 50,000 IU Vitamin D/week & low calorie diet - RCT May 2018</h4><p><strong>The effect of vitamin D supplementation in combination with low-calorie diet on anthropometric indices and androgen hormones in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial</strong></p><p>.J Endocrinol Invest. 2018 May;41(5):597-607. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-017-0785-9.>doi: 10.1007/s40618-017-0785-9.</a> Epub 2017 Nov 6.</p><p>Jafari-Sfidvajani S1,2, Ahangari R3, Hozoori M4, Mozaffari-Khosravi H2,5, Fallahzadeh H6, Nadjarzadeh A7,8.</p><p>PURPOSE:</p><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is known as the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive age women.

Elevated antimüllerian hormone in PCOS plays a key role in ovulatory dysfunction. The epidemic of vitamin D deficiency affects reproductive potential. Vitamin D3 therapy has been suggested to improve the metabolic disturbances observed in women with PCOS. We hypothesized that vitamin D3 supplementation improves follicular health in vitamin D-deficient women with PCOS, as reflected by normalization of the abnormally elevated antimüllerian hormone serum levels.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>Fifty-seven women without PCOS and 20 with PCOS diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency (less than 20 ng/mL) were either treated with <strong>50,000 IU of vitamin D3 once weekly for 8 weeks</strong> (n=16 PCOS, 45 non-PCOS) or not treated (n=4 PCOS, 12 non-PCOS). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (ng/mL) and antimüllerian hormone concentrations (ng/mL) were measured before and after 8 weeks of supplementation in the treated group and 8 weeks apart in the control group. Paired t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used as appropriate.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Compared with women in a control group, antimüllerian hormone concentration of women with PCOS significantly dropped after vitamin D3 supplementation (from 5.3±0.6 to 3.9±0.5, P=.003). Vitamin D3 supplementation did not alter antimüllerian hormone levels in non-PCOS women (P=.6). All participants showed a negative correlation between age and antimüllerian hormone (P&lt;.05). As the body mass index of participants increased, there was a smaller elevation in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D after supplementation (P&lt;.05).</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>In vitamin D-deficient women with PCOS, appropriate vitamin D3 supplementation seems to improve follicular development and ovarian health as reflected by normalization of serum antimüllerian hormone. Additionally, obese women require higher doses of vitamin D3 supplementation.

One randomized controlled trial found an increased endometrial thickness in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) receiving vitamin D during intrauterine insemination cycles. Further, vitamin D supplementation had a beneficial effect on serum lipids in PCOS women. Vitamin D treatment improved endometriosis in a rat model and increased vitamin D intake was related to a decreased risk of incident endometriosis. Vitamin D was also favorably associated with primary dysmenorrhea, uterine leiomyoma, and ovarian reserve in late reproductive aged women.</p><p>SUMMARY: In women undergoing in-vitro fertilization, a sufficient vitamin D level <strong>(≥30 ng/ml)</strong> should be obtained.</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation might improve metabolic parameters in women with PCOS.</p><p>A high vitamin D intake might be protective against endometriosis.</p><hr><h4 id=pcos-may-be-due-to-being-overweight---turkey-which-also-has-low-vit-d-oct-2014>PCOS may be due to being overweight - Turkey (which also has low Vit D) Oct 2014</h4><p><strong>Intrinsic factors rather than vitamin D deficiency are related to insulin resistance in lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome.</strong></p><p>Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2014 Oct;18(19):2851-6.</p><p>Sahin S1, Eroglu M, Selcuk S, Turkgeldi L, Kozali S, Davutoglu S, Muhcu M.</p><p>1Zeynep Kamil Woman&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Disease Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. <a href=mailto:drsadiksahin@gmail.com>drsadiksahin@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>To investigate the correlation between insulin resistance (IR) and serum 25-OH-Vit D concentrations and hormonal parameters in lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</p><p>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</p><p>50 lean women with PCOS and 40 body mass index (BMI) matched controls were compared in terms of fasting insulin and glucose, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 25-OH-Vit D, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and Ferriman-Gallway (FG) scores.

Because a strong association between hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism exists in lean women with PCOS, it is advisable for this population of patients to be screened for metabolic disturbances, especially in whom chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism are observed together.</p><hr><h4 id=wikipedia-highlights-on-pcos>Wikipedia highlights on PCOS</h4><ul><li><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female endocrine disorders.</p></li><li><p>PCOS produces symptoms in approximately 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age</p></li><li><p>It is thought to be one of the leading causes of female subfertility</p></li><li><p>Common symptoms of PCOS include:</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Menstrual disorders</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>High levels of masculinizing hormones</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Metabolic syndrome</p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=pcos-decreased-by-magnesium-zinc-calcium-and-200-iu-of-vitamind---march-2018>PCOS decreased by Magnesium, Zinc, Calcium, and 200 IU of VitaminD - March 2018</h4><ul><li><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28668998>Magnesium-Zinc-Calcium-Vitamin D Co-supplementation Improves Hormonal Profiles, Biomarkers of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.</a> <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-017-1085-0>doi: 10.1007/s12011-017-1085-0</a></li></ul><blockquote><p>100 mg magnesium, 4 mg zinc, 400 mg calcium plus 200 IU vitamin D for 12 weeks</p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=pcos-treatment-by-vitamin-d-is-aided-by-metformin---meta-analysis-feb-2024>PCOS treatment by Vitamin D is aided by Metformin - meta-analysis Feb 2024</h4><p><a href=https://doi.org/10.29063/ajrh2024/v28i2.4>doi: 10.29063/ajrh2024/v28i2.4</a> PDF is behind a paywall</p><p>Our meta-analysis of nine trials demonstrates significant reductions in insulin resistance, BMI, and testosterone levels, along with increased serum vitamin D levels and improved menstrual cycle regulation after Metformin and vitamin D treatment.
