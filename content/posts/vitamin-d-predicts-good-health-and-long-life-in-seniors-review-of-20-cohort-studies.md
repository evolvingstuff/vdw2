 **Cardiovascular, Coronary, and Cardiometabolic Events** 

These events were observed in five articles reporting on negative associations between 25(OH)D and CV or coronary events. The risk of CV events increased with declining vitamin D levels at baseline. Liu et al. <sup>[69]</sup> reported a 2-time higher risk of death from heart failure for the lowest tertile in comparison with the highest one, while Brondum-Jacobsen et al. <sup>[74]</sup> showed a >50% higher risk of the lowest 25(OH)D category, which was up to 110% for fatal events. In three studies, evidence of a protective effect for the highest vitamin D levels was found <sup>[56,59,68]</sup>, with a nearly 50% risk reduction between the highest and lowest quartile <sup>[56]</sup> and with a HR = 0.71 for every increase of a SD in vitamin D level <sup>[59]</sup>. Finally, 25(OH)D was not associated with CV mortality <sup>[63]</sup> nor with nonfatal CV events <sup>[74]</sup>. Al-Khalidi et al. showed an inverse association with cardiometabolic causes of mortality (i.e., heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus), concluding that total levels of serum vitamin D <30 nmol/L were predictive of high lifetime risk of cardiovascular and metabolic death, even without weight loss or BMI modifications <sup>[77]</sup>. By contrast, 25(OH)D was not associated with CV mortality <sup>[63]</sup>, non-fatal CV events <sup>[74]</sup>, or insulin resistance <sup>[70]</sup>.

 **Conclusions** 

Conclusively, 25(OH)D status acts as a worthy biomarker to predict all-cause mortality, pulmonary events, and lung function, cardiovascular/coronary events, hip fractures, early and/or premature death, and sarcopenia incidence. Conversely, no association was found with the risk of falls, as well as with bone mineral density, cognitive function, cardiometabolic, and cancer events in adult populations who were apparently healthy at baseline. As far as 1,25(OH)2D is concerned, its associations with all-cause mortality and respiratory events do not seem to be of relevant clinical value.

There is a clear limited scientific evidence on the role of vitamin D metabolites in the multidimensional process of ageing, since the studies analyzed by our review deal with a limited spectrum of markers of healthy ageing, and markers such as social participation, social function, as well as subjective dimensions related to self-perception of own status and resources <span>[95-98]</span> were missing. For this reason, we cannot draw definitive conclusions on vitamin D as a reliable predictor of the healthy ageing process for all dimensions herein investigated. Nevertheless, we are inclined to consider the robust results on relevant markers such as longevity and incidence of disease, as a strong support to consider vitamin D as a multidimensional predictor of ill health in the ageing process. Further well-designed controlled trials to investigate whether vitamin D supplement results in superior outcomes are warranted in the future.
