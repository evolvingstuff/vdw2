<p>The goal of this  volume is to comprehensively cover a highly readable overview on our  present knowledge of positive and negative effects of UV-exposure, with a  focus on <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a> and  <a href="http://skincancer.researchtoday.net/">skin cancer</a>. Topics  that are discussed in-depth by leading researchers and clinicians range  from the newest findings in endocrinology, <a href="http://epidemiology.researchtoday.net/">epidemiology</a>,  histology, photobiology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular  pathology to new concepts for prophylaxis and treatment. Experts in the  field as well as health care professionals not intimately involved in  these specialized areas are provided with the most significant and  timely information related to these topics. It is the aim of this book  to summarize essential up-to-date information for every clinician or  scientist interested in how to balance between positive and negative  effects of UV-exposure to minimize the risks of developing <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a> deficiency and <a href="http://skincancer.researchtoday.net/">skin cancer</a>.</p>

<br /><p><img src="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/images/vitamind-0309063507.jpg" alt="Dietary" width="105" height="160"> 		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0309063507/research-20"><b>Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium, Phosphorus,  Magnesium, Vitamin D, and Fluoride</b></a> Since 1941, Recommended  Dietary Allowances (RDAs) has been recognized as the most authoritative  source of information on nutrient levels for healthy people. Since  publication of the 10th edition in 1989, there has been rising awareness  of the impact of nutrition on chronic disease. In light of new research  findings and a growing public focus on nutrition and health, the expert  panel responsible for formulation RDAs reviewed and expanded its  approach - the result: "Dietary Reference Intakes". This new series of  references greatly extends the scope and application of previous  nutrient guidelines. For each nutrient the book presents what is known  about how the nutrient functions in the human body, what the best method  is to determine its requirements, which factors (<a href="http://caffeine.researchtoday.net/">caffeine</a> or exercise, for  example) may affect how it works, and how the nutrient may be related to  chronic disease. The first volume of "Dietary Reference Intakes"  includes calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a>, and <a href="http://fluoride.researchtoday.net/">fluoride</a>. The second book  in the series presents information about thiamin, riboflavin, niacin,  vitamin B6, folate, <a href="http://vitaminb12.researchtoday.net/">vitamin  B12</a>, pantothenic acid, biotin, and choline.  Based on analysis of  nutrient metabolism in humans and data on intakes in the U.S.  population, the committee recommends intakes for each age group - from  the first days of life through childhood, sexual maturity, midlife, and  the later years. Recommendations for pregnancy and lactation are also  made, and the book identifies when intake of a nutrient may be too much.  Representing a new paradigm for the nutrition community, "Dietary  Reference Intakes" encompasses: Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) -  these are used to set Recommended Dietary Allowances. Recommended  Dietary Allowances (RDAs), and intakes that meet the RDA are likely to  meet the nutrient requirement of nearly all individuals in a life-stage  and gender group; Adequate Intakes (AIs) - these are used instead of  RDAs when an EAR cannot be calculated, and both the RDA and the AI may  be used as goals for individual intake; Tolerable Upper Intake Levels  (ULs) - intakes below the UL are unlikely to pose risks of adverse  health effects in healthy people. This new framework encompasses both  essential nutrients and other food components thought to pay a role in  health, such as dietary fiber.  It incorporates functional endpoints and  examines the relationship between dose and response in determining  adequacy and the hazards of excess intake for each nutrient.</p>

<p>In July the Washington  Post reported* that -One Billion People Don't Get Enough <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">Vitamin D</a>-, could you be  one of them? The Post article said, -There is evidence that people who  live at higher latitudes -- where the angle of the sun's rays is not  sufficient to produce adequate amounts of <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a> in the skin --  are more likely to develop and die of Hodgkin's lymphoma, colon,  pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, breast and other cancers. And there is an  association between low levels of <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a> and increased  risk for type 1 <a href="http://diabetes.researchtoday.net/">diabetes</a>,  <a href="http://multiplesclerosis.researchtoday.net/">multiple  sclerosis</a>, <a href="http://crohnsdisease.researchtoday.net/">Crohn's  disease</a>, <a href="http://hypertension.researchtoday.net/">hypertension</a>  and cardiovascular disease-.<br /><br />

The paper quoted Dr. Holick as  saying that -the current recommended adequate intake for <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a> needs to be  increased to 800 to 1,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 per  day. However, one cannot obtain these amounts from most dietary sources  unless one is eating oily fish frequently. Thus, sensible sun exposure  (or UVB radiation) and/or supplements are required to satisfy the body's  <a href="http://vitamind.researchtoday.net/">vitamin D</a>  requirement,"<br /><br />

Clearly, this is something we need to know more  about.</p>
