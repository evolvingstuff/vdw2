(50,000 IU retinyl palmitate)  to new infants

A decade later the girls had increased risk of reaction to skin prick test

VitaminDWiki wonders if this is due to Vitamin A blocking Vitamin D receptors

Background

Neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) is  **currently being considered as policy in countries at risk of deficiency** . A previous study suggested that NVAS may be associated with increased atopy. We examined the effect of NVAS on atopy by conducting long-term follow-up of a previous randomised controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau.

Methods

In 2002-2004, we randomised 4345 normal birth weight neonates to NVAS (50,000 IU retinyl palmitate) or placebo together with their Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination. In 2013, we visited the 1692 (39%) children now aged 8-10 years who were still living in the study area, and 1478 (87%) were found at home. Provided consent, a skin prick test was performed, and history of allergic symptoms was recorded. Associations of NVAS and atopy (defined as skin prick test reaction of ≥3mm) were analysed using binomial regression.

Results

Of the 1430 children with a valid  **skin prick test** , 228 (16%) were positive (more boys (20%) than girls (12%), p-value<0.0001). NVAS did not increase the overall risk of atopy (RR 1.10 <span>[95% CI 0.87-1.40]</span>). However, NVAS was associated with significantly increased risk among females (RR 1.78 <span>[1.17-2.72]</span>) but not among males (0.86 <span>[0.64-1.15]</span>, p-value for interaction between NVAS and gender=0.005). Furthermore, NVAS was associated with increased risk of wheezing among females (RR 1.80 <span>[1.03-3.17]</span>, but not among males, p-value for interaction=0.05).

Conclusion

The study corroborated previous observations; NVAS was associated with increased risk of atopy and wheezing, in this study only among females. Further studies on NVAS and atopy are warranted.
