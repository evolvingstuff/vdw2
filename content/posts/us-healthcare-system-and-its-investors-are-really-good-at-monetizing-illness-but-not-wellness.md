## [23andMe (and You, and Everyone Else)](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/23andme/%20)

 **Freakonomics Podcast with transcript** 

* “Wojcicki realized that the  **U.S. healthcare system — and its investors — were really good at monetizing illness. What about wellness? Not so profitable.** ”

* … M.I.T. Technology Review predicts that by 2021, more than 100 million people will be part of commercial genetic databases”

* “One thing that drives me crazy in health care is that there’s always this assumption that you and I — the individuals, the lay people, the non-Ph.D.’s, the non-M.D.’s — that we are incapable of taking care of ourselves”

 **I (founder of VitaminDWiki) was an early customer of 23andMe   
I found their work to be excellent  
But, they unfortunately do not mention the fact that the genes can be changed  
Your genes are NOT your destiny  
Gene activation is REDUCED by many health problems, such as cancer (see below).   
Gene activation is INCREASED by such things as Magnesium, Resveratrol, etc.  
My wife and I found via 23andMe that we both had poor vitamin D receptor genes  
I now use 8 methods (see table below) to improve my receptor  
My wife also has a high level of vitamin D, but poor health.  
She found that all she needed was Resveratrol to greatly improve her health**
