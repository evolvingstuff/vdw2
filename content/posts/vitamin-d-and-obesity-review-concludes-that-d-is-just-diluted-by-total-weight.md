## Abstract

Obesity is a significant health problem world-wide, particularly in developed nations. Vitamin D deficiency is pandemic, and has been implicated in a wide variety of disease states. This paper seeks to examine the consistently reported relationship between obesity and low vitamin D concentrations, with reference to the possible underlying mechanisms. The possibility that vitamin D may assist in preventing or treating obesity is also examined, and recommendations for future research are made. There is a clear need for adequately-powered, prospective interventions which include baseline measurement of 25D concentrations and involve adequate doses of supplemental vitamin D. Until such studies have been reported, the role of vitamin D supplementation in obesity prevention remains uncertain.

## A Much Simpler Explanation (clipped from section 2.5 of PDF)

Despite the hypotheses and findings outlined above, an elegant study of 686 community-dwelling individuals showed that a volumetric dilutional model accounted for essentially all the variability in serum 25D concentrations attributable to obesity.

Even though the factors described above may be operative, they are effectively "captured" by body weight. 

Once serum 25D concentrations in obese individuals are adjusted for body size, there is no longer a difference between obese and non-obese individuals <sup>[30]</sup>. 

The authors concluded that in obese individuals, vitamin D dosing for the treatment of deficiency  **should be based upon body weight** ,

and calculated that an input of  **<span style="color:#00F;">70-80 IU/kg/day </span>**  would be expected to produce serum 25D concentrations in the 75-100 nmol/L range.
