#### Hypercalcemia can be avoided in at least 6 ways

1 )Take less than 750 mg of Calcium

&nbsp; [1200 mg is too much Calcium for seniors if take 4,000 IU of vitamin D – Oct RCT 2018](/posts/1200-mg-is-too-much-calcium-for-seniors-if-take-4000-iu-of-vitamin-d-oct-rct-2018)

2) Take organic instead of rock Calcium (Calcium Carbonate)

&nbsp; [Plant-based Calcium probably better than rock-based](/posts/plant-based-calcium-probably-better-than-rock-based)

3) Take Magnesium to balance out the excess Calcium

&nbsp; [Calcium to Magnesium Ratio - many studies](/posts/calcium-to-magnesium-ratio-many-studies)

4) Take Vitamin K2 to decrease Calcium in blood and put it into the bones

&nbsp; [Calcium supplements go to muscle, not bone, unless have enough Vitamin K – Feb 2019](/posts/calcium-supplements-go-to-muscle-not-bone-unless-have-enough-vitamin-k)

5) Drink more water

6) Take less Vitamin D - which causes many health problems
