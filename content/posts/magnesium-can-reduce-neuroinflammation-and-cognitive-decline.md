Neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline, are a significant concern for the aging population. Neuroinflammation, a shared characteristic of these diseases, is implicated in their pathogenesis. This article briefly summarizes the role of magnesium, an essential mineral involved in numerous enzymatic reactions and critical for neuronal bioactivity, in the context of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. The potential neuroprotective effects of magnesium, including the mechanisms of neuroprotection by magnesium through maintaining neuronal ion homeostasis, reducing inflammation, and preventing excitotoxicity, are also described. Additionally, we discuss the impact of inadequate magnesium on neuroinflammation and its potential as a therapeutic agent for attenuating cognitive decline to improve neurodegenerative conditions.
