**[From Press Release](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2019/smd/vitamin-d-helps-treat-lethal-drug-resistant-tb.html)** 

10.0 million people developed active tuberculosis worldwide in 2017,

Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB.occurred in ~500,000 cases. (5%)

* "Lead researcher Professor Adrian Martineau from Queen Mary University of London said: "Multi-drug resistant TB is on the rise globally. It's notoriously difficult to treat, and it carries a much worse prognosis than standard TB."

* "By adding vitamin D to antibiotic treatment, we can boost the immune system to help the body to clear TB bugs, rather than relying on antibiotics on their own to kill the bacteria directly"

Background Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adjunctive vitamin D in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) treatment have yielded conflicting results. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis could identify factors explaining this variation.

Methods We meta-analysed IPD from RCTs of vitamin D in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy for PTB. Primary outcome was time to sputum culture conversion. Secondary outcomes were time to sputum smear conversion, mean 8-week weight and incidence of adverse events. Pre-specified sub-group analyses were done according to baseline vitamin D status, age, sex, drug-susceptibility, HIV status, extent of disease, and vitamin D receptor genotype.

Results IPD were obtained for 1850 participants in 8 studies. Vitamin D did not influence time to sputum culture conversion overall (aHR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91–1.23), but it did accelerate sputum culture conversion in participants with multidrug-resistant PTB ( **aHR 13.44** , 95% CI 2.96–60.90); no such effect was seen in those whose isolate was sensitive to rifampicin and/or isoniazid (aHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88–1.19; Pinteraction=0.02). Vitamin D accelerated sputum smear conversion overall (aHR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01–1.31), but did not influence other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions Vitamin D did not influence time to sputum culture conversion overall, but it accelerated sputum culture conversion in patients with multidrug-resistant PTB.
