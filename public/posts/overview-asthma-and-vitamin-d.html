Some add-on therapies such as vitamin D supplements have been recommended for this subgroup of patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-utility of vitamin D supplementation in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma in Colombia.</p><p>Methods A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. The model was analyzed probabilistically, and a value of information (VOI) analysis was conducted to inform the value of conducting further research to reduce current uncertainties in the evidence base. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) value of US$5180.</p><p>Results The mean incremental cost of vitamin D supplementation versus no supplementation is USD $44.60. The mean incremental benefit of vitamin D supplementation versus no supplementation is 0.05 QALY. This position of absolute dominance (vitamin D supplementation has lower costs and higher QALYs than no supplementation) is unnecessary to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Our base-case results were robust to variations in all assumptions and parameters.</p><p>Conclusion <strong>Add-on therapy with vitamin D supplementation is a cost-effective strategy for patients between 6 and 17 years of age with mild to moderate asthma in Colombia.</strong></p><hr><h4 id=adult-asthma-was-somewhat-helped-by-5000-iu-daily-for-3-months-takes-5-months-for-response-to-plateau---rct-may-2024>Adult Asthma was somewhat helped by 5,000 IU daily for 3 months (takes 5 months for response to plateau) - RCT May 2024</h4><p>**Reminder: Asthmatics need 2X more vitamin D to get the same response as non-asthmatics</p><p><a href=10.1017/S0007114524000953>FREE PDF</a></p><hr><h4 id=4400-iu-of-vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-did-reduce-asthma-viddart---oct-2023-span-stylecolor00funfortunately-the-pdf-is-behind-a-paywallspan--prenatal-vitamin-d-supplementation-to-prevent-childhood-asthma-15-year-results-from-the-vitamin-d-antenatal-asthma-reduction-trial-vdaart-j-allergy-clin-immunol--2023-oct-16s0091-67492301254-x-doi-101016jjaci202310003httpsdoiorg101016jjaci202310003>4,400 IU of vitamin D during pregnancy did reduce Asthma (VIDDART) - Oct 2023** <span style=color:#00f>Unfortunately, the PDF is behind a paywall</span> **** Prenatal Vitamin D Supplementation to Prevent Childhood Asthma: 15-Year Results from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) **J Allergy Clin Immunol . 2023 Oct 16:S0091-6749(23)01254-X. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2023.10.003>doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2023.10.003</a></h4><p>Scott T Weiss, Hooman Mirzakhani, Vincent J Carey, George T O&rsquo;Connor, Robert S Zeiger, Leonard B Bacharier, Jeffrey Stokes, Augusto A Litonjua</p><p>This article provides an overview of the findings obtained from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) spanning a period of 15 years. The review covers various aspects, including the trial&rsquo;s rationale, study design, initial intent-to-treat analyses, and an explanation of why those analyses did not achieve statistical significance. Additionally, the article delves into the post-hoc results obtained from stratified intent-to-treat analyses based on maternal vitamin D baseline levels and genotype stratified analyses.</p><p>These results demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in asthma among offspring aged 3 and 6 years when comparing vitamin D supplementation** (4400 IU/day) **to the standard prenatal multivitamin with vitamin D (400 IU/day). Furthermore, these post-hoc analyses found that vitamin D supplementation led to a decrease in total serum IgE levels and improved lung function in children, in comparison to those whose mothers received a placebo alongside the standard prenatal multivitamin with vitamin D. Lastly, the article concludes with recommendations regarding the optimal dosing of vitamin D for pregnant women to prevent childhood asthma, as well as suggestions for future trials in this field.</p><hr><h4 id=see-asthma-and-vitamin-d-on-the-web>See asthma and Vitamin D on the web</h4><ul><li><p>[There’s No ‘One Size Fits All’ Treatment for Asthma](<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/15/well/live/theres-no-one-size-fits-all-treatment-for-asthma.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/15/well/live/theres-no-one-size-fits-all-treatment-for-asthma.html</a>) NYT Feb 2021 <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/there-s-no-one-size-fits-all-treatment-for-asthma---the-new-york-times.pdf>NYT PDF</a></p><ul><li>A wide variety of triggers and treatments <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/asthma-guidelines.pdf>56 page guidelines PDF</a> The word VITAMIN does not occur once</li></ul></li></ul><p>*** Asthmatics exhale better if higher level of Vitamin D - 2018 **> Correlation between the vitamin D levels and asthma attacks in children: Evaluation of the effects of combination therapy of atomization inhalation of budesonide, albuterol and vitamin D supplementation on asthmatic patients.</p><blockquote><p>MEF25 = Maximal Expiratory Flow at 25% of Forced Vital Capacity</p></blockquote><blockquote><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/mef25-percent.jpg alt=image width=400></blockquote><blockquote><p>** <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/asthma-2018.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a> *** [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=asthma+&amp;recr=&amp;rslt=&amp;type=&amp;cond=&amp;intr=%22vitamin+d%22&amp;outc=&amp;spons=&amp;lead=&amp;id=&amp;state1=&amp;cntry1=&amp;state2=&amp;cntry2=&amp;state3=&amp;cntry3=&amp;locn=&amp;gndr=&amp;rcv_s=&amp;rcv_e=&amp;lup_s=&amp;lup_e=|** Clinical Trials **] 70 Vitamin D intervention trials for Asthma of Nov 2020, including</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04117581?term=asthma&amp;recrs=abdf&amp;intr=%22vitamin+d%22&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=4">Adults 5,000 IU daily</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03686150?term=asthma&amp;recrs=abdf&amp;intr=%22vitamin+d%22&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=5">Children: 50,000 IU loading + 10,000 IU daily</a></p></li><li><p><a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/health/evidence-mounts-linking-acetaminophen-and-asthma.html>Studies Suggest an Acetaminophen-Asthma Link</a> NYT Dec 2011 - NOT vitamin D</p><ul><li><p>The sharp worldwide increase in childhood asthma over the past 30 years has long perplexed researchers,</p></li><li><p>Doctors stopped giving aspirin to children with fevers, opting instead for acetaminophen.

The level of 25(OH)D3 was used as a continuous variable to analyze its correlation with the risk of asthma using the Cox proportional regression model. In addition, subjects were divided into four groups according to their 25(OH)D3 quartiles, and the first quantile group was used as a reference to analyze the risk of asthma in the other groups. Further subgroup analysis was conducted according to the patient&rsquo;s gender and birth season.</p><p>Results: Among the 1,534 subjects included, there were 107 cases in the asthma-affected group and 1,427 cases in the normal control group. Compared with the control group, the level of 25(OH)D3 in the asthma group was significantly lower (P=0.03), the mother&rsquo;s education level was lower (P=0.002), but the preterm birth rate, cesarean section rate, and parental asthma prevalence rate were significantly higher (all P&lt;0.05). When the neonatal 25(OH)D3 was divided into quartiles to perform a categorical variable analysis, we found that compared with the first quantile (Q1, 0.0-25.1 mmol/L), the risk of asthma in Q4 was reduced by 50% (HR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.38-0.76). The second quantile group (Q2) and the third quantile group (Q3) showed no significant difference in the risk of disease compared with Q1 but showed a trend of decreasing risk as the quantile group increased (the trend P values were both &lt;0.05). This correlation was still valid when a stratified analysis was made based on gender and birth season.</p><p>Conclusions: There is a significant correlation between a reduced vitamin D level in newborns and the subsequent risk of asthma in children aged 3-9 years. Moreover, the level of vitamin D is an independent risk factor for childhood asthma.</p><hr><h4 id=the-worse-the-asthma-in-children-the-lower-their-vitamin-d-level---feb-2019>The worse the asthma in children, the lower their vitamin D level - Feb 2019</h4><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/asthma-feb-2019.jpg alt=image width=500><p><strong>Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D in asthmatic children and its relation to disease severity</strong></p><p>International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health, DOI: <a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20185510>http://dx.doi.org/10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20185510</a></p><p>Ihab Hafez El Sawy, Passant Al-Said Moaz, Ghada Mohamed Farouk El Deriny, Mohamed Sami Abd El Moniem El Kholy</p><p>Background: Asthma is a chronic immunological disorder of the lungs. Vitamin D has several effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems. Little is known about vitamin D level and its impact on severity of asthma in children. This study aimed to determine vitamin D levels in asthmatics versus control children; studying the relation if any between these levels and asthma severity.</p><p>Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 60 asthmatic children and 20 apparently healthy children as controls. Asthma patients were divided into 3 groups (mild, moderate, severe; 20 each). Asthma severity was based on GINA criteria. Vitamin D level was measured to all study group.</p><p>Results: The difference between the mean values of vitamin D level in control and asthmatic patients was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). This difference between control group and each asthma subgroup and between asthma subgroups versus each other were statistically significant being highest in control and lowest in patients with severe asthma (p&lt;0.001). Differences in vitamin D status in control and all asthmatic patients were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). The difference between control group and each asthma subgroup according to vitamin D status were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

Then you release the medication from the inhaler by pressing the canister down, breathe in slowly and deeply through the spacer (for spacers with a whistle, you do not want to hear the whistle), and hold your breath for 10 seconds.
