**Sun ==> Skin** 

More people who have dark skins (4X less Vitamin D if dark skin)

More seniors (4X less Vitamin D from the sun per minute, also more clothes, outdoors less)

Outdoors less - smog, 

Outdoors less - not feel comfortable outdoors (dark skin, overweight, safety)

Outdoors less - cannot see video screens in the bright noonday light

Outdoors less - avoid skin cancer

Use screen blocking before getting Vitamin D

Less Cholesterol  in diet ==> less Vitamin D generated by the sun

 **Food ==> Gut** 

Less fat in diet ==> Less Vitamin D absorbed from gut (unless using a gut-friendly form of Vitamin D)

Less vitamin D in farmed fish (4X less)

Less vitamin D in meat - raised indoors

Less vitamin D in eggs - raised indoors

Fewer people drinking milk (more dark-skinned people who are lactose intolerant)

Fewer people dring whole milk (Vitamin D in low-fat milk is XX less available)

More people with diabetes or poor gut

More seniors (4X less Vitamin D from the gut)

 **Blood Vitain D not activated or is consumed** 

Fatty tissue (Obesity) removes Vitamin D from the blood

Magnesium is needed by vitamin D in 8 places

&nbsp; &nbsp; Less Mg in food 

Toxins: DDT, PCB, Roundup

Salt  ==> reduces Calcium in body ==> consumes more Vitamin D to restore the lost Calcium

Drugs which block Vitamin D(especially seniors)

 **Blood ==> Cells**   some also in gut group

Low Magnesium

Omega-3 is needed to get Vitamin D into cells

&nbsp; &nbsp; Less Omega-3 in food

&nbsp; &nbsp;  Benefits of Omega-3 are reduced with the increased Omega-6

&nbsp; &nbsp; Note: 7 things reduce blocking by the Vitamin D Receptor
