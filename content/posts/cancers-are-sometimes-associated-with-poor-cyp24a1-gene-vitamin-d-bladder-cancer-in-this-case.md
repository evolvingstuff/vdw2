#### Association Between CYP24A1 Polymorphisms and Bladder Cancer Risk in the Chinese Han Population

In this cohort of 217 bladder cancer patients and 484 healthy controls, we explored the association between CYP24A1 variants (rs2762934, rs1570669, rs6068816, rs2296241) and bladder cancer risk in the Chinese Han population. Utilizing the Agena MassARRAY system, we genotyped four selected CYP24A1 polymorphisms. Logistic regression revealed a significant association of rs2762934 and rs1570669 with elevated bladder cancer risk, while rs6068816 exhibited a protective effect. Bioinformatics analysis of CYP24A1 expression in normal and cancerous bladder tissues indicated higher expression in normal tissue. 

In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential role of CYP24A1 variants in bladder cancer susceptibility.
