In order to provide a comprehensive and updated review, we conducted this meta-analysis to further investigate the relationship between vitamin D concentrations and DFUs occurrence. The following databases, including Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed, CBM, CNKI, WANFANG DATA and VIP Database, were systematically searched for studies published up to Dec. 20th, 2023. The combined estimation was calculated using both fixed-effects and random-effects models. The overall effect size was reported as a weighted mean difference (WMD) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Data analysis was performed utilizing Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 14. The Protocol has been registered in PROSPERO CRD42024503468. This updated meta-analysis, incorporating thirty-six studies encompassing 11,298 individuals with or without DFUs, demonstrated a significant association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and an elevated risk of DFUs occurrence (&lt; 25 nmol/L, <strong>OR 3.28</strong> , P &lt; 0.00001; &lt; 50 nmol/L, OR 2.25, P &lt; 0.00001; &lt; 75 nmol/L, OR 1.67, P = 0.0003). Vitamin D concentrations were significantly lower in individuals with DFUs compared to those without DFUs (P &lt; 0.00001). Subgroup analyses consistently demonstrated this trend among the older population (> 50 years, P &lt; 0.00001), individuals with long duration of diabetes (> 10 years, P &lt; 0.00001), and those with poor glycemic control (mean HbA1c 8%-9% and > 9%, P &lt; 0.00001).</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/diabetic-foot-ulcers-sept-2024-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=association-between-vitamin-d-deficiency-and-diabetic-foot-ulcer-wound-in-diabetic-subjects-a-meta-analysis---may-2022>Association between vitamin D deficiency and diabetic foot ulcer wound in diabetic subjects: A meta-analysis - May 2022</h4><p>Int Wound J . 2022 May 14. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.13836>doi: 10.1111/iwj.13836</a></p><p>Juan Lin 1, Xinxin Mo 1, Yejun Yang 2, Chao Tang 1, Jia Chen 3</p><p>A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between vitamin D deficiency and diabetic foot ulcer wounds in diabetic subjects. A systematic literature search up to March 2022 incorporated 7586 subjects with diabetes mellitus at the beginning of the study; 1565 were using diabetic subjects with foot ulcer wounds, and 6021 were non-ulcerated diabetic subjects. Statistical tools like the dichotomous and contentious method were used within a random or fixed-influence model to establish the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the influence of vitamin D deficiency in managing diabetic foot ulcer wound. Diabetic subjects with foot ulcer wounds had significantly lower vitamin D levels (MD, -6.48; 95% CI, -10.84 to -2.11, P &lt; .004), higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (&lt;50 nmoL/L) (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.32-2.52, P &lt; .001), and higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency (OR, <strong>2.53</strong> ; 95% CI, 1.65-3.89, P &lt; .001) compared with non-ulcerated diabetic subjects. Diabetic subjects with foot ulcer wounds had significantly lower vitamin D levels, higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, and higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency compared with non-ulcerated diabetic subjects.

Pubmed, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge, last updated in July 2018, were searched. We assessed eligible studies for the association between vitamin D deficiency and DFU in diabetic patients. The mean difference (MD) or the odds ratio (OR) was calculated for continuous or dichotomous data respectively. Data were analyzed by using the Cochrane Collaboration’s RevMan 5.0 software. Seven studies that involved 1115 patients were included in this study.

Some reports stated that vitamin D deficiency is also associated with diabetic foot ulcer and/or infection. Knowing the beneficial effect of vitamin D on wound healing, a quantitative evidence synthesis is needed to look for such association. Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched for from inception. The outcomes were set to be either the serum 25(OH)D level or the prevalence of patients with 25(OH)D with severe deficiency. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria with 1,644 patients; 817 diabetic patients with foot ulcers and 827 patients having diabetes without foot complications. The weighted mean differences was -0.93 (95% CI = -1.684 to -0.174, I2 = 97.8%, p = 0.01). The odds ratio of having severe vitamin D deficiency was <strong>3.6</strong> (95% CI = 2.940 to 4.415, I2 = 40.9%, p &lt; 0.0001), in favor of the foot group. The quality of the included studies was found to be good to excellent. Diabetic foot complications are associated with significantly lower levels of vitamin D. Patients with diabetic ulcers or diabetic infection are at higher risk of bearing severe vitamin D deficiency. Knowing the beneficial effect of vitamin D on wound healing, it is likely that recognizing and supplementing with vitamin D could prevent or improve the outcomes of diabetic foot complications.</p><hr><h4 id=diabetic-foot-ulcers-healed-14-x-better-with-vitamin-d-7-studies--meta-analysis-aug-2024>Diabetic foot ulcers healed 1.4 X better with vitamin D (7 studies) – meta-analysis Aug 2024</h4><p><strong>Effects of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic foot ulcer healing: a meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Postgrad Med J 2024 Aug 31:qgae107. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1093/postmj/qgae107>doi: 10.1093/postmj/qgae107</a> PDF behind $42 paywall</p><p>Xiaokun Wu 1, Jinchan Zeng 2, Xuemei Ye 3, Mengmiao Peng 3, Yutao Lan 4, Shuyao Zhang 5, Haiyan Li 6</p><p>Purpose: To systematically review the effect of vitamin D supplementation on diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing.</p><p>Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, Science direct, Ebsco host, CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM databases were electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the impact of vitamin D supplementation on DFUs from inception to 19 November 2022.
