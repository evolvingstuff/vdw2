#### Vitamin D and Parkinson's Disease - March 2022

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid, traditionally considered a key regulator of bone metabolism, calcium and phosphorous homeostasis. Its action is made possible through the binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), after which it directly and indirectly modulates the expression of thousands of genes. Vitamin D is important for brain development, mature brain activity and associated with many neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). High frequency of vitamin D deficiency in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to control population was noted nearly twenty years ago. This finding is of interest given vitamin D's neuroprotective effect, exerted by the action of neurotrophic factors, regulation of nerve growth or through protection against cytotoxicity. Vitamin D deficiency seems to be related to disease severity and disease progression, evaluated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale, but not with age of PD onset and duration of disease. Additionally, fall risk has been associated with lower vitamin D levels in PD. However, while the association between vitamin D and motor-symptoms seems to be possible, results of studies investigating the association with non-motor symptoms are conflicting. In addition, very little evidence exists regarding the possibility to use vitamin D supplementation to reduce clinical manifestations and disability in patients with PD. However, considering the positive balance between potential benefits against its limited risks, vitamin D supplementation for PD patients will  **probably be considered in the near future** , if further confirmed in clinical studies

#### Still unsure  about vitamin D dose and VDR to fight Parkinson's Disease - June 2022

 **Vitamin D Status and Parkinson’s Disease**

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex and progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability. Furthermore, PD is associated with a wide spectrum of non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. In recent years, some investigations, from basic science to clinical applications, have focused on the role of vitamin D in PD, often with controversial findings. Vitamin D has widespread effects on several biological processes in the central nervous system, including neurotransmission in dopaminergic neural circuits. Various studies have recorded lower levels of vitamin D in PD patients than in healthy controls. Low vitamin D status has also been correlated with the risk for PD and motor severity, whereas less is known about the effects vitamin D has on cognitive function and other non-motor symptoms. This review aims to better characterize the correlation between vitamin D and PD, clarify the role of vitamin D in PD prevention and treatment, and discuss avenues for future research in this field.

#### Dr. Coimbra treating autoimmune diseases with high-dose vitamin D

Dr. Coimbra 15 years ago has used high-dose vitamin D to successfully treat Parkinson Disease

He went on to treating many auto-immune diseases with high-dose vitamin D

He has focused on high-dose vitamin D for Multiple Sclerosis, another auto-immune disease

#### As with many other health problems, more than Vitamin D will likely be needed

Additional items needed can predicted by looking at [succesful high-dose studes](/posts/comparing-high-dose-vitamin-d-therapies)

Omega-3

Magnesium

Vitamin K

B vitamins - example: [activators of the Vitamin D Receptor](/tags/activators-of-the-vitamin-d-receptor.html), such as__

[resveratrol](/posts/resveratrol-improves-health-vitamin-d-receptor-etc-many-studies)
