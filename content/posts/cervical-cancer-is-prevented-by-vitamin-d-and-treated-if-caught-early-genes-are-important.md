#### The Preventive Role of the Vitamin D Endocrine System in Cervical Cancer

Int J Mol Sci. 2023 May 12;24(10):8665. [doi: 10.3390/ijms24108665.](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24108665.)

Vitamin D along with its active metabolite calcitriol and its metabolic and signaling system, known as the vitamin D endocrine system, have been widely recognized as a pivotal regulator of calcium homeostasis in addition to non-calcemic antitumoral effects in a variety of human cancers, including cervical cancer. Several studies have found an inverse relationship between the incidence of cervical neoplasia and vitamin D levels. 

This narrative review updates the current evidence supporting the notion that the vitamin D endocrine system has a preventive role on cervical cancer, mainly in the early phases of the disease, acting at the level of 

* suppressing cell proliferation, 

* promoting apoptosis, 

* modulating inflammatory responses, and 

* probably favoring the clearance of human papillomavirus-dependent cervical lesions. 

Although an optimal vitamin D status helps in the prevention and regression of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix, it appears that vitamin D alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents has little effectivity once advanced cervical cancer is established. These observations suggest that an optimal vitamin D status might exert beneficial actions in the early phases of cervical cancer by preventing its onset and progression.
