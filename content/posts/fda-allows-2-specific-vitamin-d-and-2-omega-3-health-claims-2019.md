#### [FDA Announces New Qualified Health Claim for Omega-3s!](http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102722411090&ca=9f9eadd5-99d1-490c-8ff3-30d5a3b1756d) Grasssroots Health

* On June 19, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced "that it does not intend to object to the use of certain qualified health claims stating that consuming eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) omega-3 fatty acids in food or dietary supplements may reduce the risk of  **hypertension and coronary heart disease** .”

* “While the FDA did not find evidence for the claim to meet the "significant scientific agreement" standard necessary to include an authorized health claim, it did meet the  **"credible evidence"**  standard that allows for a qualified health claim.”

#### It seems feasible to make similar claims for Vitamin D – there is a lot of <span style="color:#00F;">“credible evidence”</span>

 **Would be nice to have a Vitamin D group which would benefit from FDA approving “credible claims”  
<span style="color:#00F;">Would probably need >$30,000 to petition the FDA</span>  
Unfortunately, unaware of a group that would benefit**
