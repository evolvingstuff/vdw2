 **Calcitriol, the fully activated form of Vitamin D, is typically only available by prescription.** 

 **This study only has statistics for Yes/No, taking any amount of Calcitriol.** 

 **The charts appear to indicate death rates when COVID-19 came to the region.** 

 **It appears that  there was an increased death rate of <span style="color:#F00;">9X</span> for low vs high Calcitriol  ( 0.18 / 0.02)** 

 **No indication of death rate for zero vs high Calcitriol** 

 **Suspect that the Calcitriol was given daily**
