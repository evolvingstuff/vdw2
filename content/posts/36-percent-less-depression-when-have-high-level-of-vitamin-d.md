# Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with depression in an adult Norwegian population.

Kjærgaard M, Joakimsen R, Jorde R.

Psychiatry Res. 2011 Jul 22. 

Observational and intervention studies have suggested an association between low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and depressive symptoms in several subgroups of disease and age. This study tests the hypothesis in a general population. Our data are based on 10,086 persons who participated in the sixth Tromsø study carried out in 2007-2008. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using Hopkins Symptoms Check List 10 (SCL-10) based on answers from a questionnaire. 

Results were adjusted for known confounders such as age, gender, BMI, physical exercise, alcohol, education, marital status, kidney function and chronic disease. 

Results are presented for smokers (N=1966) and non-smokers (N=8120) separately as our immunoassay seems to overestimate 25(OH)D levels for smokers. 

Low serum 25(OH)D levels were found to be a significant predictor of depressive symptoms in both smokers and non-smokers (P<0.01). 

The association seemed to be stronger in women. 

Odds ratio for depression in the highest 25(OH)D quartile was 

* 0.59 (0.39-0.89) in smokers and 

* 0.74 (0.58-0.95) in non-smokers 

compared to the lowest quartile. 

However, no conclusions with regard to causality can be drawn due to the cross-sectional design of the study.

## Smokers had 36% increased chance of depression

#### (Smokers 41% less X 1966 + Non-smokers 25% less X 8120)/2 X (1966+8120)

## Even more for women - wonder how much

## Wish that the abstract stated the vitamin D levels
