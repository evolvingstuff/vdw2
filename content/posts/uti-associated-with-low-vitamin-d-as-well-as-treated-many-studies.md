Introduction and hypothesis

Vitamin D receptors are found in skeletal and smooth muscle cells throughout the body, specifically in the bladder detrusor muscle. We reviewed the current literature on the association between vitamin D deficiency and urinary incontinence (UI), and whether vitamin D supplementation plays a role in the treatment of UI symptoms.

Methods

We performed a scoping review of all available studies. PubMed, Google Scholar, and PEDro databases were searched from inception until August 2020 with the keywords “urinary incontinence,” “pelvic floor disorders,” “lower urinary tract symptoms,” “overactive bladder,” and various terms for vitamin D. No language restrictions were imposed. The reference lists of all retrieved articles were also searched.

Results

The search revealed 12 studies of different research methodologies after elimination. In 6 out of the 7 cross-sectional studies reviewed, a significant association between vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and the onset and severity of UI was found. In 2 out of the 3 prospective studies included, no association between vitamin D intake and UI was found; however, both randomized controlled trials that were reviewed found that vitamin D supplementation is effective for the treatment of UI.

Conclusions

The existing literature supports an association between low levels of serum vitamin D and UI. Initial evidence regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on UI is accumulating, yet additional, comprehensive research is warranted to establish these findings.

#### Lower UTI helped by 20,000 IU twice a week - RCT Oct 2017

 **High dose vitamin D may improve lower urinary tract symptoms in postmenopausal women.** 

J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2017 Oct;173:28-32. [doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2017.03.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2017.03.013)

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in postmenopausal women, and have been reported inversely associated with vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. The aim of this study was to investigate if high dose vitamin D supplementation would affect LUTS in comparison to standard dose. In a randomized controlled study including 297 postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density, the participants were allocated to receive capsules of 20 000IU of vitamin D3 twice a week (high dose group) or similar looking placebo (standard dose group). In addition, all the participants received 1g of calcium and 800IU of vitamin D daily. A validated questionnaire regarding LUTS was filled in at baseline and after 12 months. At baseline, 76 women in the high dose group and 82 in the standard dose group reported any LUTS. Levels of serum 25(OH)D increased significantly more in the high dose group (from 64.7 to 164.1nmol/l compared to from 64.1 to 81.8nmol/l, p<0.01). No differences between the groups were seen regarding change in LUTS except for a statistically significant reduction in the reported severity of urine incontinence in the high dose group as compared to the standard dose group after one year (p<0.05). The results need confirmation in a study specifically designed for this purpose.

#### UTIs becoming resistant to antibiotics - July 2019

 **[Urinary Tract Infections Affect Millions. The Cures Are Faltering](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/health/urinary-infections-drug-resistant.html)** 

* "For generations, urinary tract infections, one of the world’s most common ailments, have been easily and quickly cured with a simple course of antibiotics"

* ampicillin used to be the gold standard but is no longer used

* 1/3 of UTIs in NYC now resistant to Bactrim

* "Resistance to antibiotics has become one of the world’s most pressing health issues. Overuse of the drugs in humans and livestock has caused germs to develop defenses to survive, rendering a growing number of medicines ineffective in treating a wide range of illnesses — a phenomenon that is playing out worldwide with U.T.I.s."

#### Alternatives to antibiotics to treat UTI - Vitamin D, etc. 2016

 **Novel Strategies in the Prevention and Treatment of Urinary Tract Infections** 

* :"Urinary tract infections belong to the most common infections worldwide; more than 50% of women will experience at least one UTI during her lifetime"

* "The cumulative incidence during the first six years of life however is almost 7% in girls and close to 2% in boys"

"Several clinical studies have demonstrated the importance of  **sufficient vitamin D levels**  for

the protection of the urinary tract against infection. In children with UTI, serum vitamin D was

significantly lower compared to healthy controls who never had a UTI <sup>[101]</sup>; moreover, vitamin D

levels correlated with the severity of the infection. Similarly, in premenopausal women, low levels of

serum vitamin D were associated with a higher risk for recurrent UTI <sup>[102]</sup>. In an experimental study,

we could show that oral vitamin D supplementation was able to increase CAMP production in the

human bladder epithelium in response to E. coli <sup>[100]</sup>. Together, these studies clearly demonstrate that

vitamin D supplementation provides a potent alternative in the protection against UTI in vulnerable

patient groups"

#### 20,000 IU vitamin D weekly greatly reduced UTI - RCT June 2018

 **Note: average vitamin D level reached 110 nmol (44 ng/ml) in 1 year** 

 **Note: Many dropouts due to Type Ii Diabetes (Suspect 20,000 IU weekly vitamin D was not enough)** 

[Prediabetes and Diabetes proved to be prevented and treated by about 3X more Vitamin D](https://VitaminDWiki.com/Prediabetes+reduced+by+weekly+60%2C000+IU+of+Vitamin+D+%E2%80%93+RCT+Jan+2021#Diabetes_and_non-daily_intervention)

Background: In observational studies vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of infections, whereas the effect of vitamin D supplementation in randomized controlled trials is non-conclusive.

Methods: Five hundred and eleven subjects with prediabetes were randomized to vitamin D3 (20,000 IU per week) versus placebo for five years. Every sixth month, a questionnaire on respiratory tract infections (RTI) (common cold, bronchitis, influenza) and urinary tract infection (UTI) was filled in.

Results: Mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level was 60 nmol/L. Two hundred and fifty-six subjects received vitamin D and 255 placebo. One hundred and sixteen subjects in the vitamin D and 111 in the placebo group completed the five-year study. Eighteen subjects in the vitamin D group and 34 subjects in the placebo group reported UTI during the study (p < 0.02), whereas no significant differences were seen for RTI. The effect on UTI was most pronounced in males. The effect of vitamin D on UTI was unrelated to baseline serum 25(OH)D level.

Conclusion: Supplementation with vitamin D might prevent UTI, but confirmatory studies are needed.

#### UTI in women shows up as sexual intercourse pain - Sept 2023

 **[This symptom signals UTI in 83% of cases](https://www.mdedge.com/obgyn/article/265650/menopause/symptom-signals-uti-83-cases?ecd=WNL_EVE_230929_mdedge) MD Edge** 

Dyspareunia is a major indicator of urinary tract infections, being present in 83% of cases. 

The symptom is especially accurate at identifying UTIs in nonmenopausal women, researchers have found.

Eighty percent of women of reproductive age with dyspareunia had an undiagnosed UTI.
