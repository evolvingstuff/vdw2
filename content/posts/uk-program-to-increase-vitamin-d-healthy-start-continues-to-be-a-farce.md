### [Healthy Start website](http://www.healthystart.nhs.uk/)

### Amazingly UK continues to claim that 10ng vitamin D is enough

Many regulatory agencies around the world consider  **30 ng**  to be the minimum

[VitaminDWiki is very conservative and recommends __40 ng__](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

<a href="/posts/is-50-ng-of-vitamin-d-too-high-just-right-or-not-enough" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Is 50 ng of vitamin D too high, just right, or not enough">Many groups and studies believe that__ 50 ng__ is optimum</a>

A doctor who got all of his patients to  **80 ng**  found that they were FAR healthier

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  They needed medical care only 1/4 as often as before

### People have to qualify to get the Healthy Start vouchers.

They claim that there are 3 qualifications - but only #1 is on the website

1) low income, 2) dark skin, 3) low access to light 

NIH does not define how dark is dark

NIH does not define exactly how little light (# of hours?)

 **Example groups at high risk for vitamin D deficiency (not considered by NIH) include** 

Obese, patients (Cancer, etc), gut problems, liver problems, kidney problems, red hair, extensive burn, shift worker, smoker (-9 ng), live far North (Scotland),  gall bladder removed, live a long ways from a public park, heavy clothing, , . . . . 

### A packet of vouchers is sent every 4 weeks (page 34)

I could find no indication in the PDF as to how often one must apply to re-qualify to get the vouchers.

Monthly?, Quarterly?, Annually?

### What they provide can be Vitamin D2 instead of Vitamin D3 (page 36)

<a href="/posts/overview-veterinary-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Veterinary and vitamin D">Over 15 years ago veterinarians decided to never use Vitamin D2 on any mammal</a>

Also - veterinarians give about 5X more vitamin D3 to mammals than Healthy Start provides

Also -veterinarians give vitamin D based on body weight, 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Healthy Start gives 400 IU if weigh 100 lbs or 400 lbs

### 0 IU vitamin D from age 0-1 month (page 32)

### <a href="/posts/too-little-vitamin-d-for-infants-to-even-prevent-rickets" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 4231">Too little vitamin D for infants to even prevent rickets</a>

340 IU ==> age 6 months

280 IU 6 months to age 5

Note: [one country GAVE 400 IU of vitamin D to EVERY child and got a 60X reduction in rickets](/posts/rickets-reduced-60x-lessons-learned-by-turkey-2011)

Note:could not figure out difference in vitamin D with Health start for breast feeding vs bottle feeding

### Too little vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation

400 IU for women during pregnancy and lactation 

<a href="/posts/overview-pregnancy-and-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Pregnancy and vitamin D">2000 IU is an absolute minimum</a> some organizations recommend 6,000 IU during pregnancy and lactation

### ZERO vitamin D for ages 5-65 unless pregnant or lactating or one of only 2 high risk categories

Many regulatory agencies are arguing about 600 vs 800 IU

Most research studies find that >3,000 IU is needed by normal weight adults

### They suggest 400 IU if dark skin or away from the sun - but do not provide it

No place on the website for those few high risk conditions

### They suggest 400 IU for seniors - which is far too little

Note: <a href="/posts/half-of-seniors-got-zero-response-to-1600-iu-daily-for-a-year" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2618">Half of seniors got ZERO response to 1600 IU daily for a year</a>

I will guess that 80% of UK seniors will get ZERO response to 400 IU

### Summary of hassele

You must fill out a form online or be interviewed to qualify

&nbsp; &nbsp; You must prove that you have low income or dark skin or stay out of the sun

Voucher is sent to you monthly

You have to physically go to a limited number of places to exchange the voucher for the month's supply of vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp;  not available at grocery store, pharmacy, etc.

 **Far far easier to just buy a bottle of vitamin D which can be used for many years** 

Bio-Tech 50,000 IU capsule is the lowest cost vitamin D available (Nov 2014)

A $17 bottle has 100 capsules which have a total of 5,000,000 IU

This bottle would provide 12,500 person days if you assumed that a generous UK amount (400 IU) was acceptable

Most people can get to an optimal level of vitamin D (40 ng) with 3,700 IU

Then a Bio-Tech bottle would last only 1300 person days = 3.5 person years

 **PDF is difficult to read - the internal hyperlinks do not appear to work**
