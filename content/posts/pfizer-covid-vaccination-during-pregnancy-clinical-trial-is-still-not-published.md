#### EXCLUSIVE: Whatever happened to Pfizer's covid vaccine trial in pregnant women?

 **[Substack - Feb 23](https://maryannedemasi.substack.com/p/exclusive-whatever-happened-to-pfizers)** 

Trial with **<span style="color:#F00;">pregnant rats</span>:** 

""The study found the vaccine led to a  **statistically significant <span style="color:#F00;">doubling</span> in fetal loss** (9.77% mRNA vs 4.09% saline), but Pfizer concluded that the difference between the two groups was “not biologically meaningful.”

* "Unlike Pfizer, Moderna kept its pregnant rodents alive to test the embryos. Documents accessed by Judicial Watch, showed a “statistically significant” number of rats were born with skeletal variations after being injected with Moderna’s mRNA vaccine."

* "But Moderna concluded that the "Skeletal variations are structural changes that do not impact development or function of a developing embryo” and therefore “not considered adverse.”
