BACKGROUND: Insufficient levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) influence the knee joint cartilage and lead to development and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of this study was to determine the status of serum 25-OHD levels in patients with knee OA compared with controls. 

METHODS: A total of 148 patients with knee OA and 150 controls were studied. Serum 25-OHD was measured by the ELISA method and concentrations?<20 ng/ml were considered as deficient levels. Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons of means and logistic regression analysis with calculation of odds ratio (OR) was applied to determine association. 

RESULTS: The mean ages of patients and controls were 60.2?±?12.9 and 60.1?±?10.2 years, respectively (P?=?0.23). In the entire population the mean serum 25-OHD in OA patients was not significantly lower than controls (P?=?0.28), but in subgroup analysis the mean 25-OHD in OA patients aged?<60 years was significantly lower than controls (23.8?±?18.8 vs. 34.5.?±?29.6 ng/ml, P?=?0.01). In this age group knee OA was significantly associated with serum 25-OHD deficiency which remained significant after adjusting for age and sex (adjusted OR?=?2.26, 95% CI 1.15-4.4, P?=?0.018). A greater association was observed in patients aged **?<?55 years**  (OR?=?2.63, 95% CI 1.16-5.95, P?=?0.01); whereas the association between OA and serum 25-OHD deficiency in patients aged ?60 years did not reach a significant level. 

CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a significant association between serum 25-OHD deficiency and knee OA in patients aged?<?60 years and suggest serum 25-OHD measurement in any patient with symptoms suggestive of knee OA particularly at the initial stage of disease.
