#### Only Vitamin D was found to treat post-partum depression - Meta-analysis April 2023

 **Dietary interventions for perinatal depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials** 

Am J Clin Nutr. 2023 Apr 3;S0002-9165(23)46315-0. [doi: 10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.03.025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.03.025) PDF is behind a paywall

Background: Dietary interventions are a widely available intervention for depression and anxiety among pregnant and/or postpartum (i.e., perinatal) persons but their effectiveness is not well known.

Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions for the treatment of perinatal depression and/or anxiety.

Design: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science from their inception to November 2, 2022. Studies were included if they were available in English and examined the effectiveness of a dietary intervention for perinatal depression and/or anxiety in a randomized controlled trial.

Results: Our search identified 4,246 articles, 36 of which were included and 28 were eligible for meta-analysis. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. 

* Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not found to improve symptoms of perinatal depression compared to control conditions (SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.04). These results did not change when examined during pregnancy or the postpartum period separately, nor did they vary according to fatty acid ratio. 

* Elemental metals (iron, zinc, and magnesium) were also not found to be superior to placebo (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -1.05 to 0.21), though, 

* vitamin D yielded a small to medium effect size improvements (SMD, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.20) in postpartum depression. 

* Iron may help in those with confirmed iron deficiency. Narrative synthesis was performed for studies ineligible for meta-analyses.

Conclusions: Despite their widespread popularity, PUFAs and elemental metals do not appear to effectively reduce perinatal depression. Vitamin D taken in doses of 1800 to 3500 International Units (IU) per day may have some promise. Additional high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the true effectiveness of dietary interventions on perinatal depression and/or anxiety.

#### Omega-3 typically fights postpartum depression (ignores Omega-6) Jan 2024

 **A Critical Look at Omega-3 Supplementation: A Thematic Review**

 Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 10-20% of women. Traditional treatments have raised concerns, but omega-3 fatty acids show potential as an alternative. This thematic review, sourced from databases like PubMed and Scopus between 1 February 2023 and 15 March 2023, seeks to delve into the various perspectives on omega-3 supplementation for PPD. The criteria included studies detailing depressive symptoms, social functioning, and neurobiological variables. The review includes research with women showing PPD symptoms, randomized clinical trials, and articles in Spanish, English, and French. Exclusions were studies lacking proper control comparisons and other interventions besides omega-3. Data extraction was performed independently. Two key studies provide contrasting findings on omega-3's impact on PPD symptoms. In the study comparing DHA supplementation to a placebo, significant differences were not found in the EPDS scale, but differences were observed in the BDI scale. In contrast, another study recorded a significant decrease in depression scores in all dose groups, with reductions of 51.5% in the EPDS scale and 48.8% in the HRSD scale. Other studies, encompassing both prenatal and postpartum periods, underscore the differentiation between prenatal depression and PPD. Despite shared diagnostic criteria, PPD presents unique symptoms like restlessness, emotional lability, and baby-related concerns. It is crucial to address biases and obtain specific results, recommending exclusive PPD-focused studies. This review emphasizes the need for continuous exploration of omega-3's relationship with PPD to enhance the life quality of pregnant women and their families.

#### FDA announced fast-acting Zurzuvae pill for postpartum depression - Aug 2023

 **[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/08/04/fda-approves-postpartum-depression-drug-zurzuvae/?utm_campaign=wp_the7&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_the7)** 

* "The FDA warned that the drug’s side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, diarrhea, urinary tract infection and nasopharyngitis (the common cold)."

*  A persion "cautioned that Zurzuvae is not a “magic pill” for broadly solving postpartum depression."

#### To be fast acting, Vitamin D needs to start with a loading dose (otherwise it takes many months)

Millions of people have all successfully use Vitamin D loading doses.

There are an extremely wide variety of loading dose protocols, all of which work

50,000 IU of vitamin D daily for a week is one example

Hundreds of studies are compared at <a href="/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Loading of vitamin D">Overview Loading of vitamin D</a>

!!!!Only Vitamin D was found to treat post-partum depression - Meta-analysis April 2023
__Dietary interventions for perinatal depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials__
Am J Clin Nutr. 2023 Apr 3;S0002-9165(23)46315-0. doi: 10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.03.025 PDF is behind a paywall

Background: Dietary interventions are a widely available intervention for depression and anxiety among pregnant and/or postpartum (i.e., perinatal) persons but their effectiveness is not well known.

Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions for the treatment of perinatal depression and/or anxiety.

Design: We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science from their inception to November 2, 2022. Studies were included if they were available in English and examined the effectiveness of a dietary intervention for perinatal depression and/or anxiety in a randomized controlled trial.

Results: Our search identified 4,246 articles, 36 of which were included and 28 were eligible for meta-analysis. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. 
*Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were not found to improve symptoms of perinatal depression compared to control conditions (SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.04). These results did not change when examined during pregnancy or the postpartum period separately, nor did they vary according to fatty acid ratio. 
*Elemental metals (iron, zinc, and magnesium) were also not found to be superior to placebo (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -1.05 to 0.21), though, 
*vitamin D yielded a small to medium effect size improvements (SMD, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.20) in postpartum depression. 
*Iron may help in those with confirmed iron deficiency. Narrative synthesis was performed for studies ineligible for meta-analyses.
Conclusions: Despite their widespread popularity, PUFAs and elemental metals do not appear to effectively reduce perinatal depression. Vitamin D taken in doses of 1800 to 3500 International Units (IU) per day may have some promise. Additional high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine the true effectiveness of dietary interventions on perinatal depression and/or anxiety.

!!!!To be fast acting, Vitamin D needs to start with a loading dose (otherwise it takes many months)
Millions of people have all successfully use Vitamin D loading doses.
There are an extremely wide variety of loading dose protocols, all of which work
50,000 IU of vitamin D daily for a week is one example
Hundreds of studies are compared at ((Overview Loading of vitamin D))
