 **CF patients should greatly benefit from 1 or more of the following:** 

1) Gut-friendly vitamin D (more adsorbable) 

2) Topical or buccal Vitamin D (bypass many poor Vitamin D genes)

3) Infrequent Vitamin D dosing (weekly, bi-weekly)

4) Addition of Magnesium (has been found to help CF)

5) Addition of Omega-3 (has been found to help CF)

6) Inhaled Vitamin D (bypass many poor Vitamin D genes)

7) Addition of probiotic or prebiotic (reduce gut inflammation and improve Vit. D absorption)

8) Addition of vitamin D from the sun or UVB (which bypasses poor genes and poor gut)

#### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis

J Health Popul Nutr . 2024 Jan 17;43(1):11. [doi: 10.1186/s41043-024-00499-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41043-024-00499-2)

Aim: Vitamin D is a prominent modulator of immunity and respiratory function. It plays a vital role in respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). S. However, there is a dearth of information on patients with CF. The purpose of the meta-analysis is to highlight the importance of following the existing guidelines regarding maintenance of Vitamin D serum levels in patients with CF.

Methods: The systematic search was conducted without utilizing any time or language limitations in original database from the beginning until March 2022. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was determined by I2 statistics and Cochrane Q test.

Results: Pooled analysis using the random-effects model of the 8 case-control studies with 13 effect sizes revealed that the serum 25-OH-vitamin D in participants with cystic fibrosis was significantly lower than controls in pediatrics and adolescents (WMD: - 3.41 ng/ml, 95% CI - 5.02, - 1.80, p = < 0.001) and adults (WMD: - 2.60 ng/ml, 95% CI - 4.32, - 0.89, p = 0.003). Based on data from 12 studies (21 effect sizes) with a total of 1622 participants, the prevalence of vitamin D levels of 20-30 ng/ml in CF patients was 36% among pediatrics/adolescents and 63% among adults. In addition, 27% of pediatric/adolescent CF patients and 35% of adult CF patients had vitamin D levels of below 20 ng/ml.

Conclusions: As a result, according to the existing guidelines, our results proved the need to pay attention to the level of vitamin D in these patients.
