Cheng, M.D., Ph.D.</strong></p><h4 id=abstract>Abstract</h4><p>Vitamin D resistance, a condition where the body inadequately responds to vitamin D, can manifest in both hereditary and acquired forms. This paper examines the complexities of vitamin D resistance, highlighting the multifactorial nature of the condition, which involves genetic predispositions, lifestyle factors, infections, hormonal imbalances, and micronutrient deficiencies. Hereditary forms, though rare, typically involve mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR), while acquired resistance is increasingly common and often associated with chronic illnesses and environmental factors.</p><p>The paper underscores the importance of understanding these diverse contributing factors to effectively address vitamin D resistance. The concept of whole-cell nutrition, which emphasizes the synergy between various nutrients, is presented as a crucial approach to mitigating vitamin D resistance. Furthermore, the paper advocates for integrative orthomolecular medicine, which optimizes health through precise nutrient balance, lifestyle modifications, detoxification, and advanced treatments such as bioidentical hormonal balance, photo-biomodulation therapy and stem cell transplantation. Through a holistic and integrative approach, it is possible to enhance the body&rsquo;s ability to utilize vitamin D effectively, leading to improved health outcomes in conditions ranging from osteoporosis to autoimmune diseases.</p><h5 id=1-introduction>1. Introduction</h5><p>Vitamin D is essential for numerous biological functions, including calcium homeostasis, bone health, immune function, and cellular regulation. However, some individuals experience vitamin D resistance, where the body fails to respond adequately to normal or even elevated levels of vitamin D. This resistance can be categorized into two primary forms: hereditary and acquired. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and contributing factors is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment.</p><h5 id=1-vitamin-d-resistance-hereditary-and-acquired>1. Vitamin D Resistance, hereditary and acquired</h5><p>While hereditary forms of vitamin D resistance, such as those caused by mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR), are rare, acquired vitamin D resistance is increasingly recognized and can be more common. This acquired form of resistance is often linked to chronic health conditions, lifestyle factors, and immune system dysregulation. Research suggests that a significant portion of individuals might not respond adequately to standard doses of vitamin D supplementation. Studies have shown that about 25% of individuals may be &ldquo;low responders&rdquo; to vitamin D, requiring higher or more individualized doses to achieve the desired physiological effects <a href="https://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=8d3bba7425e7c98c50f52ca1b52d3735.329&amp;s=d462d372f832379613fcdf0907c3a212#Ref1">(1)</a>.</p><h4 id=1-1-hereditary-vitamin-d-resistance>1. 1 Hereditary Vitamin D Resistance</h4><p>Hereditary vitamin D resistance, also known as Hereditary Vitamin D-Resistant Rickets (HVDRR), is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. These mutations lead to a reduced ability of the VDR to bind to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D, or impair the receptor&rsquo;s function, resulting in clinical manifestations such as rickets, hypocalcemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. HVDRR typically presents in early childhood, with symptoms including skeletal deformities, growth retardation, and in some cases, alopecia. Treatment usually involves high doses of calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) and calcium supplements to overcome the resistance <a href="https://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=8d3bba7425e7c98c50f52ca1b52d3735.329&amp;s=d462d372f832379613fcdf0907c3a212#Ref2">(2-7)</a>.</p><h4 id=1-2-acquired-vitamin-d-resistance>1. 2 Acquired Vitamin D Resistance</h4><p>Acquired vitamin D resistance occurs later in life and is not caused by genetic mutations. Instead, it results from a variety of external and internal factors that impair the body&rsquo;s ability to utilize vitamin D effectively. This form of resistance is often associated with chronic illnesses, certain medications, or conditions that affect vitamin D metabolism. Recent research indicates that lifestyle factors including diet, sleep, exercise, toxins, nutrition and even hormonal imbalance can all contribute to vitamin D resistance. Examples of acquired vitamin D resistance include chronic kidney disease, which impairs the conversion of vitamin D to its active form, and certain autoimmune conditions, where inflammation and immune dysregulation can alter vitamin D metabolism and receptor function.</p><h4 id=1-3-diagnosis-of-vitamin-d-resistance>1. 3 Diagnosis of Vitamin D Resistance</h4><p>Vitamin D resistance is a diagnosis of exclusion and involves a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests (including serum levels of 25(OH)D and PTH) and monitoring the response to vitamin D supplementation. Elevated PTH levels in conjunction with sufficient vitamin D status are particularly indicative of resistance <a href="https://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=8d3bba7425e7c98c50f52ca1b52d3735.329&amp;s=d462d372f832379613fcdf0907c3a212#Ref1">(1)</a>.</p><ul><li><p>Clinical Symptoms: Patients may present with symptoms indicative of vitamin D deficiency or resistance, such as bone pain, muscle weakness, or signs of rickets or osteomalacia.</p></li><li><p>Medical History: A comprehensive medical history should include an evaluation of dietary vitamin D intake, sun exposure, and any chronic illnesses such as oral/dental infections, chronic kidney disease or gastrointestinal disorders. Other lifestyle factors that may adversely affect vitamin D metabolism should also be considered.</p></li><li><p>Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) Levels: Measure serum levels of 25(OH)D to determine vitamin D status. Low levels may indicate deficiency, but not necessarily resistance.</p></li><li><p>Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Levels: Elevated PTH levels despite adequate or high levels of 25(OH)D are a hallmark of acquired vitamin D resistance.

Conclusion</h5><p>Vitamin D resistance is a complex condition that can arise from a combination of genetic, physiological, and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor dietary habits (such as diets high in carbohydrates, seed oils rich in omega-6 fats, and ultra-processed foods), inadequate sleep, lack of exercise and sun exposure, certain prescription medications, exposure to heavy metals and chemical toxins, vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, and chronic infections. Understanding and addressing these interconnected factors is essential for overcoming vitamin D resistance and ensuring optimal vitamin D status for health.</p><p>Vitamin D resistance, whether hereditary or acquired, is influenced by a myriad of factors. This paper emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach that considers the complex interactions between vitamin D and other essential nutrients. The concept of whole-cell nutrition, which highlights the synergy between various vitamins, minerals, and nutrients, is critical in addressing and potentially mitigating vitamin D resistance. Integrative orthomolecular medicine, which focuses on optimizing health through precise nutrient balance, as well as incorporating healthy diets, other lifestyle factors and hormonal balance, presents a promising strategy for managing vitamin D resistance. By adopting a comprehensive, integrative approach, we can enhance the body&rsquo;s ability to utilize vitamin D effectively, leading to improved health outcomes.</p><p>The causes of vitamin D resistance discussed in this paper are also key contributors to many other chronic health conditions. Vitamin D resistance is just one mechanism through which these underlying issues can impair health. Achieving optimal health requires a comprehensive approach that includes recognizing, identifying, and managing these root causes, in addition to the intermediary mechanisms and their clinical manifestations.</p><p>Integrative orthomolecular medicine should include not only optimal nutrition but also essential interventions such as lifestyle modifications, detoxification, hormonal balance, and advanced treatments like stem cell transplantation and other biological therapies.</p><p>With this holistic approach, we have developed an Integrative Orthomolecular Medicine Protocol <a href="https://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=8d3bba7425e7c98c50f52ca1b52d3735.329&amp;s=d462d372f832379613fcdf0907c3a212#Ref126">(126)</a> and have successfully managed a wide range of diseases. Our protocol includes regular testing and vitamin D supplementation, along with a healthy lifestyle that emphasizes a balanced diet low in carbohydrates, omega-6 seed oils, and ultra-processed foods, as well as intermittent fasting, exercise, sun exposure, and quality sleep. We also prioritize optimal nutrition, hormonal balance, detoxification, correction of other root causes, and the application of advanced therapies such as near-infrared photo-biomodulation therapy (PBMT), methylene blue, and stem cell transplantation.</p><p>Through this approach, we have observed significant improvements and, in many cases, complete reversal of chronic diseases, including osteoporosis, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer, autoimmune diseases, mood disorders, and psychiatric conditions.</p><h3 id=126-references-on-line>126 References on-line</h3></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384352"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384352",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384352"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384352"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384352"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384352"></script></body></html>
