Otherwise your body has to somehow increase the vitamin D in the donated blood

 **Typically low level** 

African-American

Obese

People with many health problems

Might be advisable to supplement with vitamin D if the donated blood has a low vitamin D level

Perhaps future blood will not only be checked for type but also vitamin D level

Do not expect this to happen until vitamin D test time and costs are both significantly reduced
