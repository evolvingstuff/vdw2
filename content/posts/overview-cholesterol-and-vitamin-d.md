#### The Great Cholesterol Scam and The Dangers of Statins - substack June 2024

 **[MidWesternDoctor](https://www.midwesterndoctor.com/p/the-great-cholesterol-scam-and-the?utm_campaign=email-post&r=ofo3r&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** 

* "My primary issue with the statins is not the fact we waste billions each year on a useless therapy (approximately 25 billion per year in America alone). Rather, it’s the fact that they have a  **very high rate of injury** . For example, the existing studies find between a 5-30% rate of injuries, and Dr. Malhotra, having gone through all the existing evidence estimates that 20% of statin users are injured by them."

* "Likewise, statins are well known for having a high percentage of patients discontinue the drugs due to their side effects (e.g., one large study found 44.7% of older adults discontinue the drugs within a year of starting them, while another large study of adults of all ages found  **47% discontinued within a year** )."

#### Vitamin D + Omega-3  reduces Cholesterol and LDL - meta-analysis Feb 2024

 **The effects of vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation on lipid profile in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Mohammad Zamani, Zahra Sohrabi, Ladan Aghakhani, Kimia Leilami, Saeed Nosratabadi, Zahra Namkhah, Cain Clark, Neda Haghighat, Omid Asbaghi, Fatemeh Fathi 

Nutrition & Food Science [https://doi.org/10.1108/NFS-11-2022-0387](https://doi.org/10.1108/NFS-11-2022-0387) PDF is behind $37 paywall

Previous research indicates that vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation may benefit overall health, but current evidence regarding its effects on lipid profile remains unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation on lipid profile (total cholesterol <span>[TC]</span>, low-density lipoprotein <span>[LDL]</span>, triglyceride <span>[TG]</span> and high-density lipoprotein <span>[HDL]</span>) in adults.

Design/methodology/approach

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, relevant studies were obtained by searching the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases (from inception to January 2022). Weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were estimated via a random-effects model. Heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were reported using standard methods.

Findings

Pooled analysis of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed that vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation yielded significant reductions in TG (p = 0.631). A pooled analysis of five trials indicated a significant association between omega-3 and vitamin D treatment and reductions in TC (p = 0.001) and LDL (p = 0.001). Although, pooled analyses of omega-3 and vitamin D did not significantly affect HDL.

Originality/value

The findings suggest that vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation lowers TG, TC and LDL in adults. Future, large-scale, RCTs on various populations are needed to elucidate further beneficial effects of vitamin D and omega-3 co-supplementation on lipid profile and establish guidelines for clinical practice.

* "The study,18 conducted from 1968 to 1973, included 9,423 participants between the ages of 20 and 97, making it the largest trial of its kind."

* "For every 30-point drop in total cholesterol, there was a 22 percent increased chance of death."

* Statins continue to be prescribed (to lower cholesterol) even though:

> "100 people need to take a statin as a primary preventive for five years in order for one or two people to avoid a heart attack, and none will actually live longer."

#### Quote on Cholesterol and vitamin D from Vitamin D Council

Our most important hormones depend upon adequate reserves of cholesterol for their production, and nowhere is this more important than as the precursor substance for the synthesis of Vitamin D, known also as calcitriol. Researchers in this field are sufficiently concerned from the results of their studies to pronounce that we are in the midst of an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency of immense proportion ~ Duane Graveline MD MPH, former NASA Astronaut, former USAF flight surgeon, and retired family doctor.'

#### [What Is the Connection Between Vitamin D and Cholesterol?](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-connection-between-vitamin-d-and-cholesterol.htm) WiseGeek

Vitamin D and cholesterol are closely linked, both in bodily processes as well as in nutrition. One important role of cholesterol is that is plays a vital part in the synthesis of vitamin D in the body. In the diet, vitamin D is found in foods that have high levels of cholesterol, such as cod liver oil and eggs. Studies have been done to see if there is a correlation between the levels of vitamin D a person has and their cholesterol levels, but the results are inconclusive.

There is a close connection in the body between Vitamin D and cholesterol. One of the biggest sources of vitamin D for individuals is contact with sunlight; upon exposure to sunlight, the body can synthesize its own vitamin D. Cholesterol is involved in the process of synthesizing vitamin D from sunlight, and without cholesterol, vitamin D synthesis would be impossible.

Dietary sources also provide a connection between Vitamin D and cholesterol. There is typically a correlation between foods that are rich in vitamin D and cholesterol — that being, foods that are high in vitamin D are often also high in cholesterol. For example, cod liver oil is an excellent source of vitamin D, but it is also very high in cholesterol. Other foods that are high in vitamin D are lard and eggs, two foods that are notorious for being high in cholesterol.

Many scientists are researching a possible correlation between an individual’s levels of vitamin D and cholesterol. High cholesterol, also known as hypercholesterolemia, affects many individuals and increases o! one’s risk for heart disease and stroke. It is important to keep cholesterol levels under control in order to stay healthy, which is why many are searching to see if there is a correlation between these two nutrients.

Studies seem to show that individuals with higher levels of vitamin D have lower cholesterol levels and are generally healthier overall than individuals with low levels of vitamin D. Yet; these studies do not show a direct correlation between the two. For example, vitamin D is involved in calcium absorption, so having higher levels of vitamin D may mean that more calcium is being absorbed and that calcium is the nutrient actually causing an effect on cholesterol. Individuals with high levels of vitamin D also may have these high levels because they spend a lot of time outdoors in the sunlight doing physical activities, which is one way to reduce cholesterol. Although studies indicate that individuals with high levels of vitamin D have lower cholesterol, it is unknown whether or not this result is directly related to vitamin D.

There are many benefits of vitamin D, such as helping to regulate levels of calcium, preventing osteoporosis, and improving moods. If one chooses to take vitamin D supplements to help lower cholesterol or to gain any of the many benefits of this nutrient, they should choose their supplements carefully. Two popular types of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is naturally occurring and easy for the body to process. Vitamin D2 is difficult for the body to process and may result in toxicity. Vitamin D3 is the safer supplement to choose from, and daily recommended dosages should always be followed.

#### The gene which lowers cholesterol levels results in 88% less heart disease

* " About 1 in 40 African Americans have a mutation that drops their LDL cholesterol from around 130 down toward more optimal levels. Now, this group didn’t eat healthily to get achieve that drop. It’s just in their genes. More than half had high blood pressure, and there were a lot of smokers and diabetics in the group, yet those with genetically low LDL levels still had a significant reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease even in the presence of all those other risk factors. How significant? How much less heart disease? A remarkable 88 percent of heart disease was simply gone."
