#### Might long-covid symptoms be reduced by corticosteroids?  Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024

 **[Detailed Answer](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/might-long-covid-symptoms-be-r-VGr5PU8VRc.4rAXBH24zZg)  short answer, probably** 

* "Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. The theory is that steroids may counter the chronic inflammatory response in long-COVID and prevent progression to a late, immune-mediated stage of disease."

* "Long-COVID is accompanied by immunological alterations characterized by inflammation and reduced immune regulation. Corticosteroids may help revert these immune alterations"

#### 64% of Brazilians had Long-COVID symptoms 1 year after hospital discharge (wonder why) – July 2024

 **Long COVID among Brazilian Adults and Elders 12 Months after Hospital Discharge: A Population-Based Cohort Study**

The persistence of symptoms for more than three months following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is referred to as “Long COVID”. To gain a deeper understanding of the etiology and long-term progression of symptoms, this study aims to analyze the prevalence of Long COVID and its associated factors in a cohort of Brazilian adults and elders, twelve months after hospital discharge. An observational, prospective, and follow-up study was performed with a cohort of adults and older adults diagnosed with COVID-19 in 2020 in the State of Paraná, Brazil. Twelve months after hospital discharge, patients answered a  **phone questionnaire**  about the persistence of symptoms after three levels of exposure to COVID-19’s acute phase (ambulatory, medical ward, and intensive care unit). According to the characteristics of participants, the prevalence of Long COVID-19 was calculated, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. We analyzed data from 1822 participants (980 adults <span>[≥18–<60 years]</span> and 842 older people <span>[≥60 years]</span>) across three exposure levels.  **The overall Long COVID prevalence was 64.2%.**  Long COVID was observed in 646 adults (55%; of which 326 were women) and 523 older people (45%; of which 284 were women). Females had a higher prevalence of long-term symptoms (52%) compared with men. The most common post-COVID-19 conditions in the 12-month follow-up were neurological (49.8%), followed by musculoskeletal (35.1%) and persistent respiratory symptoms (26.5%). Male individuals were less likely to develop Long COVID (aOR = 0.50). Other determinants were also considered risky, such as the presence of comorbidities (aOR = 1.41). Being an adult and having been hospitalized was associated with the development of Long COVID. The risk of developing Long COVID was twice as high for ward patients (aOR = 2.53) and three times as high for ICU patients (aOR = 3.56) when compared to non-hospitalized patients. Presenting clinical manifestations of digestive (aOR = 1.56), endocrine (aOR = 2.14), cutaneous (aOR = 2.51), musculoskeletal (aOR = 2.76) and psychological systems (aOR = 1.66) made adults more likely to develop Long COVID. Long COVID was present in a large proportion of people affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presence of Long COVID symptoms displayed a dose–response relationship with the level of disease exposure, with a greater prevalence of symptoms associated with the severe form in the acute period.

##### Vitamin D was the only statistically significant factor

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/long-covid-risk.png" alt="image" width="600">

Context

Long COVID is an emerging syndrome affecting 50% to 70% of COVID-19 survivors that still lacks predicting factors.

Objective

Due to the extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, we retrospectively assessed the association between 25(OH) vitamin D levels and long COVID in COVID-19 survivors 6 months after hospitalization.

Methods

Long COVID was defined according to NICE guidelines. Fifty long COVID and 50 non–long-COVID subjects matched on a 1:1 basis were enrolled from an outpatient clinic post-COVID cohort seen from August to November 2020. Therapies/comorbidities affecting calcium/vitamin D/bone metabolism, and/or admission to the intensive care unit during hospitalization were exclusion criteria. 25(OH) Vitamin D was measured at hospital admission and 6 months after discharge.

Results

We observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels, evaluated at follow-up, in subjects with long COVID than those without (20.1 vs 23.2 ng/mL, P = .03). Regarding the affected health areas evaluated in the entire cohort, we observed lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels in those with neurocognitive symptoms at follow-up (n = 7) than those without (n = 93) (14.6 vs 20.6 ng/mL, P = .042). In patients presenting vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), both at admission and at follow-up (n = 42), those affected by long COVID (n = 22) presented lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels at follow-up than those not affected (n = 20) (12.7 vs 15.2 ng/mL, P = .041). In multiple regression analyses, lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels at follow-up were the only variable significantly associated with long COVID in our cohort (P = .008, OR 1.09, CI 1.01-1.16).

Conclusion

COVID-19 survivors with long COVID have lower 25(OH) vitamin D levels than matched patients without long COVID. Our data suggest that vitamin D levels should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. The role of vitamin D supplementation as a preventive strategy of COVID-19 sequelae should be tested in randomized controlled trials.

#### Long-COVID 100% gone in 29% of long-COVID patients after histamin treatment (mast cells) - March 2024

 **[LONG COVID, MAST CELL ACTIVATION, AND FINDING A WAY OUT](https://impactofvitamind.com/long-covid-mast-cell-activation-and-finding-a-way-out/) Eugene Hayden** 

* In the treatment of MCAD, to calm down the inappropriate activation of the mast cell, the drug montelukast (Singular) could be added to the regime.  (see Sumantri and Rengganis, 2023)  This measure just might be effective in the treatment of my Long COVID.  What would I have to lose?"

* "And, of course, there are things I could do on my own that may give me an edge. I could add quercetin, vitamin C, and curcumin to the treatment plan—all compounds known to bring calm to the mast cell.  (see  Hamilton, 2018)  Medical supervision required.  Additionally, a gluten-free diet may be of help, as gluten has been shown to stimulate the mast cell (Hamilton, 2024)."

* "lost income would be more than $50 billion annually"

* "costs have been estimated for similar conditions. If treatment of long COVID is similar to treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome), these estimated costs could be about $9000 per person annually"

* "In an October 2020 analysis, we estimated9 the then-nascent COVID-19 pandemic might result in $2.6 trillion of cost as a result of long COVID."

 **Founder of VitaminDWiki has low-level Long-COVID  (first time in my life to have pollen allergy) and suspects that perhaps 1 billion people have low-level Long-COVID** 

 **Timelines (Clipped from PDF)** 

The onset and time course of symptoms differ across individuals and by symptom type. Neurological symptoms often have a delayed onset of weeks to months: among participants with cognitive symptoms, 43% reported a delayed onset of cognitive symptoms at least 1 month after COVID-19, with the delay associated with younger age 83. Several neurocognitive symptoms worsen over time and tend to persist longer, whereas gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms are more likely to resolve, 74,142. Additionally, pain injoints, bones, ears, neck and back are more common at 1 year than at 2 months, as is paresthesia, hair loss, blurry vision and swelling of the legs, hands and feet143. Parosmia has an average onset of 3 months after the initial infection144; unlike other neurocognitive symptoms, it often decreases over time143.

 **Few people with long COVID demonstrate full recovery** , with one study finding that 85% of patients who had symptoms 2 months after the initial infection reported symptoms 1 year after symptom onset 143. Future prognosis is uncertain, although diagnoses of ME/CFS and dysautonomia are generally lifelong.

1. postexertional malaise and fatigue; 

1. brain fog, postexertional malaise, and fatigue; 

1. fatigue, postexertional malaise, dizziness, brain fog, gastrointestinal issues, and palpitations.

<span style="color:#00F;">Blue line = not hospitalized</span>

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to postacute sequelae in multiple organ systems, but evidence is mostly limited to the first year postinfection. We built a cohort of 138,818 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 5,985,227 noninfected control group from the US Department of Veterans Affairs and followed them for 2 years to estimate the risks of death and 80 prespecified postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) according to care setting during the acute phase of infection. The increased risk of death was not significant beyond 6 months after infection among nonhospitalized but remained significantly elevated through the 2 years in hospitalized individuals. 

Within the 80 prespecified sequelae, 69% and 35% of them became not significant at 2 years after infection among nonhospitalized and hospitalized individuals, respectively. 

Cumulatively at 2 years, 

* PASC contributed 80.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 71.6–89.6) and  **642.8**  (95% CI: 596.9–689.3) disability-adjusted life years  **(DALYs) per 1,000 persons**  among nonhospitalized and hospitalized individuals; 25.3% (18.9–31.0%) and 21.3% (18.2–24.5%) of the cumulative 2-year DALYs in nonhospitalized and hospitalized were from the second year. 

In sum, while risks of many sequelae declined 2 years after infection, the substantial cumulative burden of health loss due to PASC calls for attention to the care needs of people with long-term health effects due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

##### Personal experience - recovering from about 20 years of lost respiratory capacity - founder of VitaminDWiki

 **2020:**  I routinely biked up a 1-mile hill 3 times with 36 lbs attached to my bike   
    My last vaccination was about 60 years ago   
 At no time did I have symptoms of COVID infection (Vitamin D level currently 180 ng) - perhaps had asymptomatic COVID   
 Note: [Long-Haul COVID-19 occurred to 1 in 20 who had been asymptomatic (a study of 2 million with COVID-19) – June 2021](/posts/long-haul-covid-19-occurred-to-1-in-20-who-had-been-asymptomatic-a-study-of-2-million-with-covid-19)   
  **2021:**  I could not get up the 1-mile hill once with only 12 lbs attached to my bike   
 Strongly felt it was due to reduced inhalation capacity   
 Had a lung function test and was using Albuterol for about a month   
 My doctor wanted to prescribe an Albuterol alternative for the rest of my life. I refused.   
 I purchased and am using a l[ung exercise device](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FE8N7Y4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) **** Sept 2022: **Recovering - after 2 weeks I am now able to bike up the hill twice with 12 lbs   
 Have ceased using Albuterol   
 Looking forward to using more weight on my bike and/or going up the hill more times

Notes

* Might not have been Long-COVID, but instead a long-term adverse reaction to Sudafed (Pseudoephedrine)

* I have been using (Inhaled Vitamin D) before intense exercise since about 2017

A Scottish population cohort of 33,281 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 62,957 never-infected individuals were followed-up via 6, 12 and 18-month questionnaires and linkage to hospitalization and death records. Of the 31,486 symptomatic infections,1,856 (6%) had not recovered and 13,350 (42%) only partially. No recovery was associated with hospitalized infection, age, female sex, deprivation, respiratory disease, depression and multimorbidity. Previous symptomatic infection was associated with poorer quality of life, impairment across all daily activities and 24 persistent symptoms including

* breathlessness (OR 3.43, 95% CI 3.29

* chest pain (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.96–2.23), and

* confusion (OR 2.92, 95% CI 2.78–3.07).

Asymptomatic infection was not associated with adverse outcomes.   
 Vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of seven symptoms.

The Institute of Medicine estimates that it affects 836,000 to 2.5 million people in the U.S. alone, but is so misunderstood and stigmatized that about 90 percent of people who have it have never been diagnosed. "

* "Many cases of long COVID are effectively ME/CFS by another name. The exact number is hard to define, but past studies have shown that 5 to 27 percent of people infected by various pathogens, including Epstein-Barr virus and the original SARS, develop ME/CFS.** Even if that proportion is 10 times lower for SARS-CoV-2, the number of Americans with ME/CFS would still have doubled in the past three years. **"

* "American ME/CFS patients may outnumber the population of 15 individual states, but ME/CFS specialists couldn’t fill a Major League Baseball roster." (26 doctors)

* "The hallmark symptom of ME/CFS—post-exertional malaise, or PEM—means even light physical or mental exertion can trigger major crashes that exacerbate every other symptom. Doctors who are unfamiliar with PEM, including many now running long-COVID clinics, can unwittingly hurt their patients by encouraging them to exercise."** See in VitaminDWiki **** [Overview Fibromyalgia or Chronic Fatigue and vitamin D](/posts/overview-fibromyalgia-or-chronic-fatigue-and-vitamin-d) **large doses of vitamin D reduced CFS/Fibromyalgia in > 10 studies** ((Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and long-haul COVID-19) **---

It wasn’t even included in the list of possible COVID symptoms when the coronavirus pandemic first began. But 20 to 30 percent of patients report brain fog three months after their initial infection, as do 65 to 85 percent of the long-haulers who stay sick for much longer. "

* "At its core, Hellmuth said, it is almost always a disorder of “executive function”—the set of mental abilities that includes focusing attention, holding information in mind, and blocking out distractions."

* "That specific constellation of problems also befalls many people living with HIV, epileptics after seizures, cancer patients experiencing so-called chemo brain, and people with several complex chronic illnesses such as fibromyalgia. It’s part of the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS—a condition that Davis and many other long-haulers now have."

##### Perhaps brain fog could be treated by brain plasticity (opinion of the founder of VitaminDWiki)

If I had brain fog, I would use my computer program which has greatly improved brain plasticity for me for over a decade.   
 About 1/3 of BrainHQ exercises can be used for free. https://www.brainhq.com/   
 I would use it for at least 30 minutes a day and would anticipate noticeably reduced fog in less than a week.

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/long-covid-symptoms.jpg" alt="image" width="600">   
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystem illness caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can manifest with a multitude of symptoms in the setting of end-organ damage, though it is predominantly respiratory. However, various symptoms may remain after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this condition is referred to as “Long COVID” (LC). Patients with LC may develop multi-organ symptom complex that remains 4–12 weeks after the acute phase of illness, with symptoms intermittently persisting over time. The main symptoms are fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and limitation of functional capacity. Pediatric patients developed the main symptoms of LC like those described in adults, although there may be variable presentations of LC in children. The underlying mechanisms of LC are not clearly known, although they may involve pathophysiological changes generated by virus persistence, immunological alterations secondary to virus–host interaction, tissue damage of inflammatory origin and hyperactivation of coagulation. Risk factors for developing LC would be female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnea, previous psychiatric disorders, and alterations in immunological, inflammatory and coagulation parameters. There is currently no specific treatment for LC, but it could include pharmacological treatments to treat symptoms, supplements to restore nutritional, metabolic, and gut flora balance, and functional treatments for the most disabling symptoms. In summary, this study aims to show the scientific community the current knowledge of LC.
