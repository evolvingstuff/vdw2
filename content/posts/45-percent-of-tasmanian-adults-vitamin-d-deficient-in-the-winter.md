Objective:? This study aims to describe the life-time picture of vitamin D deficiency, as measured by serum 25(OH)D concentration, in Tasmania ( **latitude 43°S** ). 

Methods:? Five cross-sectional studies were used: A sample of primary school children (n=201, aged 7-8 years), two samples of adolescents (sample 1: n=374, aged 15-18 years; sample 2: n=136, aged 16-19 years), a sample of young to middle aged adults (n=262, aged 19-59 years), and a sample of older adults (n=1092, aged 50-80 years). 

Results:? In winter/spring, approximately two third of the adolescents and adults (young, middle-aged and older) had 25(OH)D levels ?50 nmol/L and around 10% had 25(OH)D levels ?25 nmol/L. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was much lower for primary school children (11.5% <50 nmol/L, 0.5% ?25 nmol/L). In summer/autumn, approximately one third of the adolescents and adults had 25(OH)D levels ?50 nmol/L, and very few had 25(OH)D levels ?25 nmol/L. For the adolescents and adults, even among those who reported the highest category of sun exposure, approximately 45% had 25(OH)D levels ?50 nmol/L in winter/spring. 

Conclusions:? Vitamin D deficiency was uncommon among our sample of primary school children, but increased substantially during the teenage years, and seemed to remain high throughout the rest of life suggesting mild vitamin D deficiency is endemic in Tasmania apart from in the very young.

### Vitamin D decreases with how old the child is in school

In the US (and perhaps Tasmania) children the first years of school get many recess hours outdoors - thus getting lots of vitamin D

As the child gets older the # of outdoor hours decrease, so less vitamin D
