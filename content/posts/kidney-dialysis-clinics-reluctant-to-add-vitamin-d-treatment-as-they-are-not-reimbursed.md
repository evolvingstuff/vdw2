#### A cost effective complement to managing the vitamin D deficient and anemic dialysis patient in the bundled world.

Vitamin D deficiency is a common health complication in patients with chronic kidney disease and can be treated with an abundance of classical and advanced pharmaceutics. However, the impact of bundling in dialysis clinics limits the use of the most optimal therapeutics and desired efficacy targets in end-stage renal disease patients.

To address this issue, we investigated the benefits of adding a cost-effective antioxidant and vitamin D nutraceutical (MV-ONE, Nephrian Inc.) to patient regiments. This nutraceutical was used in an attempt to replete vitamin D levels and decrease inflammation that dialysis patients experience. Additionally, we investigated the potential of this therapy to reduce the need for erythropoietin-stimulating agents.

Results indicate MV-ONE caused:

* (1) increases in 25-OH vitamin D (p = 0.0058),

* (2) decreases in ESA dose (p = 0.0475), and

* (3) no change in C-reactive protein (p = 0.3290).

Overall, this suggests the addition of MV-ONE does benefit the vitamin D deficiency and anemia observed in ESRD patients.
