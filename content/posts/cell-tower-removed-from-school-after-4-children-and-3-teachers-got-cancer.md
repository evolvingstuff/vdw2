* German study fo 1000 people found a 3X increase in newly diagnosed cancers in those living within 400 meters of a cell tower

* ‘“Significantly, the residents not only developed cancer at a higher rate – but they developed it at younger ages”

* “You can also make use of special shielding – including window films, mesh curtains, EMF-resistant paints, and metal foils”

#### Comment by founder of VitaminDWiki

Many stressors are known to cause health problems

Vitamin D allows the body to fight many stressors, such as

* [Toxins](/posts/low-vitamin-d-is-one-of-the-causes-of-oxidative-stress-and-aging)

* [Heavy Metals](/posts/low-vitamin-d-is-one-of-the-causes-of-oxidative-stress-and-aging)

* Some Drugs, most Chemo

* [Smoking](/posts/smoking-reduces-vitamin-d-many-studies)

* [Air Pollution](/posts/low-vitamin-d-is-one-of-the-causes-of-oxidative-stress-and-aging)

* [Glyphosate](/posts/investigation-on-roundup-glyphosate-at-vitamindwiki)

* [Antibiotics](/posts/antibiotics-probiotics)

* [Excessive sugar](/posts/the-startling-link-between-sugar-and-alzheimers)

* [DNA damage resulting excessive sun/UV](/posts/vitamin-d-protects-dna-against-uv-skin-damage-5-studies-2012-2013)

 **Suspect that Vitamin D also can reduce stress from excessive radio frequencies** 

* Would be interesting to know how low the vitamin D levels were in the children and teachers who got cancer
