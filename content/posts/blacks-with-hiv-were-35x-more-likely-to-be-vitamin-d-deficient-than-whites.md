We evaluated the prevalence of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> deficiency and the risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in HIV-infected patients in the South-Central United States. The study consisted of a cross-sectional assessment of vitamin D levels in HIV-infected patients receiving routine clinical care from a private practice in Houston, Texas (latitude 29°N). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25(OH)D less than 20?ng/ml (<50?nmol/liter). Two-hundred enrolled patients were surveyed with a vitamin D questionnaire to determine daily supplemental vitamin D intake, dietary vitamin D intake, and average sunlight exposure (minutes/day). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Median 25(OH)D was 15.5?ng/ml (interquartile range 10.9-24.6) for the total population (n=200). 

Approximately, two-thirds (64%) of patients had vitamin D deficiency and 20.5% had severe vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D <10?ng/ml or <25?nmol/liter](25(OH)D%20<10?ng/ml%20or%20<25?nmol/liter). In univariate analysis, African-American race, current tobacco use, increased body mass index (BMI), lower serum calcium level, no supplemental vitamin D use, and low daily supplemental and total daily vitamin D intake were significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. 

In multivariate analysis, African-American race <span>[adjusted odds ratio (AOR) __3.53__ (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83-6.82)]</span>, higher BMI <span>[AOR 1.07 (95% CI 1.002-1.139)]</span>, and low daily vitamin D supplemental intake <span>[AOR 0.997 (95% CI 0.996-0.999)]</span> were significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. No HIV factors including antiretroviral class use were significantly associated with either vitamin D deficiency or severe vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency and severe vitamin D deficiency were highly prevalent in this HIV population. In the HIV population, African-Americans or patients with a high BMI may benefit from vitamin D supplementation.
