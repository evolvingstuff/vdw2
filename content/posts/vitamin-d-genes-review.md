Vitamin D is essential for good health. Dermal vitamin D production is dependent on environmental factors such as season and latitude, and personal factors such as time spent outdoors and genetics. Varying heritability of vitamin D status by season has been reported, suggesting that  **gene-environment interactions (<span style="color:#F00;">GxE</span>)**  may play a key role. Thus, understanding GxE might significantly improve our understanding of determinants of vitamin D status. The objective of this review was to survey the existing methods in GxE on vitamin D studies and report on GxE effect estimates. We searched the Embase, Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science (Core Collection) databases. We included only primary research that reported on GxE effects on vitamin D status using 25-hydroxyvitamin D as a biomarker. 

Sun exposure was the only environmental exposure identified in these studies. The quality assessment followed the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Seven studies were included in the final narrative synthesis. We evaluate the limitations and findings of the available GxE in vitamin D research and provide recommendations for future GxE research. The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021238081).
