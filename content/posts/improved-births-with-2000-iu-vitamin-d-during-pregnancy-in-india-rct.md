### Role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of preterm labour

Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol. 2015; 4(1): 86-93[doi: 10.5455/2320-1770.ijrcog20150217](https://doi.org/10.5455/2320-1770.ijrcog20150217)

Background: Although vitamin D insufficiency is increasingly recognized as a health problem across the world, inadequate vitamin D status appears to be particularly prevalent in certain populations such as the elderly and pregnant women. With respect to the latter, impaired vitamin D status during gestation is associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy such as preterm birth and poor neonatal outcome. 

Methods: A total of 100 healthy, pregnant women in Sawangi, Meghe, Wardha, were recruited in 2012. Of these, 50 were randomised to receive either  **2000 IU**  (study group) of vitamin D3 per day from 12-16 weeks of gestation of pregnancy. The remaining 50 pregnant women, who formed the control group were not supplemented with any drug. 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> in maternal blood was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay, at recruitment and at the time of delivery and a serum 25(OH)D level <30 nmol/l was defined as deficiency. 

Results: Patients had deficiency of vitamin D at baseline (80.00%) was converted into sufficient level (76.00%) in cases after vitamin D supplementation. It was statistically significant at 5% level as P value <0.05 and there was also evidence in reduction of preterm birth. 

Conclusions: Maternal vitamin D deficiency is associated with significant increase risk for premature birth with P = 0.001. Maternal serum vitamin D sufficiency can be achieved by supplementing pregnant women with 2000 IU vitamin D supplements.
