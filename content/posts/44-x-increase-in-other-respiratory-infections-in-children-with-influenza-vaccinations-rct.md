#### Increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infections associated with receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine

Randomized Controlled Trial Clin Infect Dis. 2012 Jun;54(12):1778-83. [doi: 10.1093/cid/cis307](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis307)

We randomized 115 children to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or placebo. Over the following 9 months, TIV recipients had an increased risk of virologically-confirmed non-influenza infections (relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8). Being protected against influenza, TIV recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses.
