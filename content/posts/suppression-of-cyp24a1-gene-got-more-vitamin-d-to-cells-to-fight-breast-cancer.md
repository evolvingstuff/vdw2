Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the human body not only for the metabolism of calcium but also for homeostasis. Vitamin D contributes to cell fate decisions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and viability. Accumulated epidemiological data suggest a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and carcinogenesis in numerous organs. Furthermore, it is known that the expression of the vitamin D metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 family 24 subtype A1  **(CYP24A1), is increased in different types of human malignancy including breast carcinoma.**  However, the pathological relevance of elevated CYP24A1 expression level requires further clarification. In the present study, it was demonstrated that CYP24A1 promoted the oncogenic property of breast carcinoma cells. Consistent with previous reports, it was demonstrated that the expression of CYP24A1 was elevated in invasive breast carcinoma and significantly decreased the overall survival of patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Importantly, suppression of CYP24A1 expression significantly enhanced cell death sensitivity to two anticancer drugs with pharmacologically different modes of action, cisplatin and gefitinib. The results of the present study suggest the possibility of CYP24A1inhibiting therapy as a novel therapy in breast cancer with overexpression of CYP24A1.

##### Note: Various Cancers have learned to protect themselves by activating the CYP24A1 gene

##### How CYP24A1 was deactivated (by Perplexity AI)

* The CYP24A1 enzyme was deactivated using specific small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. 

* In the study, MCF7 breast cancer cells were transfected with two different CYP24A1-specific shRNA-expressing lentivirus plasmids. 

* These shRNAs, identified as CYP24A1 shRNA #1296 and CYP24A1 shRNA #1016, were used to suppress the expression of CYP24A1 in the cells.

* The transfected cells were then selected using puromycin, and the reduction in CYP24A1 expression was confirmed through immunofluorescent assays and reverse transcription-PCR analysis

!!!!Suppression of the vitamin D metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 provides increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in breast cancer
Oncology Reports  https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2023.8522

Vitamin D is an essential nutrient for the human body not only for the metabolism of calcium but also for homeostasis. Vitamin D contributes to cell fate decisions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and viability. Accumulated epidemiological data suggest a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and carcinogenesis in numerous organs. Furthermore, it is known that the expression of the vitamin D metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 family 24 subtype A1 __(CYP24A1), is increased in different types of human malignancy including breast carcinoma.__ However, the pathological relevance of elevated CYP24A1 expression level requires further clarification. In the present study, it was demonstrated that CYP24A1 promoted the oncogenic property of breast carcinoma cells. Consistent with previous reports, it was demonstrated that the expression of CYP24A1 was elevated in invasive breast carcinoma and significantly decreased the overall survival of patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Importantly, suppression of CYP24A1 expression significantly enhanced cell death sensitivity to two anticancer drugs with pharmacologically different modes of action, cisplatin and gefitinib. The results of the present study suggest the possibility of CYP24A1inhibiting therapy as a novel therapy in breast cancer with overexpression of CYP24A1.

!!!!!Note: Various Cancers have learned to protect themselves by activating the CYP24A1 gene
!!!!!How CYP24A1 was deactivated (by Perplexity AI)
*The CYP24A1 enzyme was deactivated using specific small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. 
*In the study, MCF7 breast cancer cells were transfected with two different CYP24A1-specific shRNA-expressing lentivirus plasmids. 
*These shRNAs, identified as CYP24A1 shRNA #1296 and CYP24A1 shRNA #1016, were used to suppress the expression of CYP24A1 in the cells.
*The transfected cells were then selected using puromycin, and the reduction in CYP24A1 expression was confirmed through immunofluorescent assays and reverse transcription-PCR analysis
