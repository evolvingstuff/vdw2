BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cross-sectional studies indicate vitamin D to be of importance for glucose tolerance, blood pressure and serum lipids, but whether supplementation with vitamin D would improve cardio-vascular risk factors is not known. 

DESIGN AND SETTING: The study was a 1 year, double blind placebo-controlled intervention trial performed at the University Hospital of North Norway from November 2005 to October 2007. Subjects. A total of 438 overweight or obese subjects, 21-70 years old, were included and 330 completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: The subjects were randomized to vitamin D (cholecalciferol, vitamin D(3))  **40 000 IU per week**  (DD group), vitamin D 20 000 IU per week (DP group), or placebo (PP group). All subjects were given 500 mg calcium daily. 

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fasting serum lipids and blood pressure were measured and an oral glucose tolerance test performed at start and end of the study. 

RESULTS: At baseline the mean serum 25(OH)D levels were  **58**  nmol L(-1) (all subjects) and increased to  **140**  and 101 nmol L(-1) in the DD and DP groups, respectively. No significant differences were found between the three groups regarding change in measures of glucose metabolism or serum lipids. In the DP group, there was a slight but significant increase in systolic blood pressure compared with the placebo group. 

CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support a positive effect of vitamin D on glucose tolerance, blood pressure or serum lipids. Further studies in subjects with low serum 25(OH)D levels combined with impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension or dyslipidaemia are needed. PMID: 20141565
