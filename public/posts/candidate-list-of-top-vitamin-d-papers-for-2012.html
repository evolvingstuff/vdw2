One of the recently identified target areas of VD is male reproductive function. The VD receptor (VDR) and the VD metabolizing enzyme expression studies documented the presence of this system in the testes, mature spermatozoa, and ejaculatory tract, suggesting that both systemic and local VD metabolism may influence male reproductive function. However, it is still debated which cell is the main VD target in the testis and to what extent VD is important for sex hormone production and function of spermatozoa. This review summarizes descriptive studies on testicular VD metabolism and spatial distribution of VDR and the VD metabolizing enzymes in the mammalian testes and discusses mechanistic and association studies conducted in animals and humans. The reviewed evidence suggests some effects of VD on estrogen and testosterone biosynthesis and implicates involvement of both systemic and local VD metabolism in the regulation of male fertility potential.</p><p>J Hum Lact. 2012 May;28(2):159-66. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/0890334411434802.>doi: 10.1177/0890334411434802.</a></p><h3 id=vitamin-d-status-among-4-month-old-infants-in-new-england-a-prospective-cohort-study>Vitamin D status among 4-month-old infants in New England: a prospective cohort study.</h3><p>Merewood A, Mehta SD, Grossman X, Chen TC, Mathieu J, Holick MF, Bauchner H.</p><p>Source</p><p>Division of General Pediatrics, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA. <a href=mailto:anne.merewood@bmc.org>anne.merewood@bmc.org</a></p><p>Abstract</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>Concerns over vitamin D deficiency in infants and children recently prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to recommend increased supplementation.

However, epidemiological evidence supporting their individual associations with incident cerebrovascular disease is scarce. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, published before February 2012 and sought from MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS and the Science Citation Index databases, and reported cerebrovascular disease (defined as any fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack) by circulating vitamin D (25-hydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> as active metabolite) and calcium levels. Two independent investigators abstracted information on 25(OH)D and calcium, cerebrovascular outcomes and other characteristics from selected studies. Relative risks (RRs) were pooled by both random and fixed effects meta-analyses and were further examined under different study-level characteristics. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger&rsquo;s asymmetry test. From 5,778 initial references, nine unique prospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. Seven studies (involving 47,809 participants and 926 cerebrovascular events) focused on circulating 25(OH)D and 3 reported on circulating calcium (22,577 participants and 727 events). For 25(OH)D, in a comparison of individuals in the top third versus those in the bottom third at baseline, the combined RR for cerebrovascular disease, adjusted for several conventional risk factors, was 0.60 (95 % CI 0.48, 0.72). The corresponding RR in the prospective studies that reported on baseline circulating calcium levels for cerebrovascular disease was 1.40 (95 % CI 1.19, 1.64). There was no apparent evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias among included studies. Available data indicate that higher circulating level of vitamin D is associated with a decreased risk of cerebrovascular disease.

Although their metastatic potential is generally low, they can and do metastasize, especially in the immune compromised host, and their surgical treatment is often quite disfiguring. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) as occurs with sunlight exposure is generally regarded as causal for these malignancies, but UVR is also required for synthesis in the skin. Based on our own data and that reported in the literature, we hypothesize that the produced in the skin serves to suppress UVR epidermal tumor formation. In this review we will first discuss the evidence supporting the conclusion that the receptor (VDR), with or without its ligand 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, limits the propensity for cancer formation following UVR. We will then explore three potential mechanisms for this protection: inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of differentiation, immune regulation, and stimulation of DNA damage repair (DDR).</p><p>Photochem Photobiol Sci. 2012 Nov 19;11(12):1837-47. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1039/c2pp25202c.>doi: 10.1039/c2pp25202c.</a></p><h3 id=1α25-dihydroxyvitamin-d3-enhances-cellular-defences-against-uv-induced-oxidative-and-other-forms-of-dna-damage-in-skin>1α,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D(3) enhances cellular defences against UV-induced oxidative and other forms of DNA damage in skin.</h3><p>Gordon-Thomson C, Gupta R, Tongkao-On W, Ryan A, Halliday GM, Mason RS.</p><p>Source</p><p>Department of Physiology, The Bosch Institute, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. <a href=mailto:rebeccam@physiol.usyd.edu.au>rebeccam@physiol.usyd.edu.au</a>.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation is the key initiator for skin carcinogenesis since mutations may arise from the photoproducts and it also contributes to photoimmune suppression. The active vitamin D hormone, 1α,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) reduces thymine dimers, the major photoproduct found in human skin after UV exposure, and suppresses the accumulation of nitric oxide derivatives that lead to more toxic reactive nitrogen species (RNS). We examined whether other forms of DNA damage are reduced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and hypothesized that photoprotection by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is, in part, due to the suppression of various forms of promutagenic DNA damage, including thymine dimers, through a reduction of genotoxic RNS. Different forms of UV-induced DNA damage were investigated in irradiated skin cells treated with or without 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), or inhibitors of metabolism and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Keratinocytes were also treated with nitric oxide donors in the absence of UV light. DNA damage was assessed by comet assay incorporating site specific DNA repair endonucleases, and by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to thymine dimers or 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2&rsquo;-deoxyguanosine, and quantified by image analysis. Strand breaks in T4 endonuclease V, endonuclease IV and human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase digests increased more than 2-fold in UV irradiated human keratinocytes, and were reduced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment after UV exposure, and also by low temperature, sodium azide and an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Conversely, nitric oxide donors induced all three types of DNA damage in the absence of UV. We present data to show that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) protects skin cells from at least three forms of UV-induced DNA damage, and provide further evidence to support the proposal that a reduction in RNS by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is a likely mechanism for its photoprotective effect against oxidative and nitrative DNA damage, as well as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.</p><h3 id=maternal-vitamin-d-levels-and-the--phenotype-among-offspring>Maternal Vitamin D Levels and the Phenotype Among Offspring.</h3><p>Whitehouse AJ, Holt BJ, Serralha M, Holt PG, Hart PH, Kusel MM.</p><p>Source</p><p>Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, 100 Roberts Road, Subiaco, West Perth, WA, 6008, Australia, <a href=mailto:awhitehouse@ichr.uwa.edu.au>awhitehouse@ichr.uwa.edu.au</a>.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>We tested whether maternal vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is related to the phenotype.

The DASS21 depression scale was used to screen for depression, and serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and PTH were measured by radioimmunoassay. Multiple logistic regression models were used to explore the association between serum 25(OH)D and PTH levels and depression. The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) decreased linearly with increasing quartiles of serum 25(OH)D (P(trend) = 0.00). The OR for having depression was significantly higher among individuals in the first and second quartiles (OR = 1.4, 1.23, respectively) than among those in the fourth quartile (P values = 0.00 and 0.03, respectively). This relationship remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, marital status, education, BMI, serum creatinine, number of chronic diseases (OR = 1.39 and 1.21 and P values = 0.00 and 0.05, respectively) and after further adjustment for exercise, altitude, and smoking (OR = 1.48 and 1.24, respectively, and P values = 0.00 and 0.03, respectively). No significant association was found between serum PTH levels and depression.

Evidence of a relationship between intake and the development of RA and between serum levels and RA activity was studied by summarizing published results using a meta-analysis approach. Three cohort studies including 215,757 participants and 874 incident cases of RA were considered in this meta-analysis, and eight studies on the association between serum levels and RA activity involving 2,885 RA patients and 1,084 controls were included. Meta-analysis showed an association between total intake and RA incidence (relative (RR) of the highest vs. the lowest group = 0.758, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.577-0.937, p = 0.047), without between-study heterogeneity (I (2) = 0 %, p = 0.595). Individuals in the highest group for total intake were found to have a 24.2 % lower of developing RA than those in the lowest group. Subgroup meta-analysis also showed a significant association between supplement intake and RA incidence (RR 0.764, 95 % CI 0.628-0.930, p = 0.007), without between-study heterogeneity. All studies, except for one, found that levels are inversely associated with RA activity. One study found no correlation between levels and disease activity among 85 RA patients, but these patients had a high incidence of deficiency, which might have influenced the study outcome. Meta-analysis of 215,757 participants suggests that low intake is associated with an elevated of RA development. Furthermore, available evidence indicates that level is associated with RA activity.</p><p>Neurology. 2012 Sep 25;79(13):1397-405.</p><h3 id=cognition-and-dementia-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis>cognition, and dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</h3><p>Balion C, Griffith LE, Strifler L, Henderson M, Patterson C, Heckman G, Llewellyn DJ, Raina P.</p><p>Source</p><p>Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. <a href=mailto:balion@hhsc.ca>balion@hhsc.ca</a></p><p>Abstract</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>To examine the association between cognitive function and dementia with concentration in adults.</p><p>METHODS:</p><p>Five databases were searched for English-language studies up to August 2010, and included all study designs with a comparative group.

The effect of vitamin D supplementation, however, has not been well studied. We examined the associations between vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation, and patient outcomes in a large cohort. Serum vitamin D measurements for 5 years and 8 months from a large academic institution were matched to patient demographic, physiologic, and disease variables. The vitamin D levels were analyzed as a continuous variable and as normal (≥30 ng/ml) or deficient (&lt;30 ng/ml). Descriptive statistics, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazard modeling were performed. Of 10,899 patients, the mean age was 58 ± 15 years, 71% were women (n = 7,758), and the average body mass index was 30 ± 8 kg/m(2). The mean serum vitamin D level was 24.1 ± 13.6 ng/ml. Of the 10,899 patients, 3,294 (29.7%) were in the normal vitamin D range and 7,665 (70.3%) were deficient. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with several cardiovascular-related diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes (all p &lt;0.05). Vitamin D deficiency was a strong independent predictor of all-cause death (odds ratios 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.901 to 3.662, p &lt;0.0001) after adjusting for multiple clinical variables. Vitamin D supplementation conferred substantial survival benefit (odds ratio for death 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.277 to 0.534, p &lt;0.0001).

Our current clothing habits and reduced time spent outdoors put us at risk of many insufficiency-related diseases that are associated with calcaemic and non-calcaemic functions of vitamin D. Populations with traditional lifestyles having lifelong, year-round exposure to tropical sunlight might provide us with information on optimal vitamin D status from an evolutionary perspective. We measured the sum of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and D3 (25(OH)D) concentrations of thirty-five pastoral Maasai (34 (sd 10) years, 43 % male) and twenty-five Hadzabe hunter-gatherers (35 (sd 12) years, 84 % male) living in Tanzania. They have skin type VI, have a moderate degree of clothing, spend the major part of the day outdoors, but avoid direct exposure to sunlight when possible. Their 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations of Maasai and Hadzabe were 119 (range 58-167) and 109 (range 71-171) nmol/l, respectively. These concentrations were not related to age, sex or BMI. People with traditional lifestyles, living in the cradle of mankind, have a mean circulating 25(OH)D concentration of 115 nmol/l.

Estimated erythemal UVR exposure from satellite Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data from NASA was linked to the US Census Bureau 2000 census tract (centroid) of baseline residence for each subject. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for multiple potential confounders to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for quartiles of UVR exposure. Restricted cubic splines examined nonlinear relationships. Over 9 years of follow-up, UVR exposure was inversely associated with total cancer risk (N = 75,917; highest versus lowest quartile; HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-0.99; p-trend &lt; 0.001). In site-specific cancer analyses, UVR exposure was associated with increased melanoma risk (highest versus lowest quartile; HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.13-1.32; p-trend &lt; 0.001) and decreased risk of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.74-0.92) and colon (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82-0.96), squamous cell lung (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75-0.98), pleural (HR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.38-0.84), prostate (HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.88-0.95), kidney (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.73-0.94) and bladder (HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.81-0.96) cancers (all p-trend &lt; 0.05).

This review summarises current evidence pertaining to the evolution of these attributes. The biggest changes in the integument occurred during the course of human evolution in equatorial Africa, under regimes of high daytime temperatures and high ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Loss of most functional body hair was accompanied by the evolution of an epidermis with a specialised stratum corneum and permanent, protective, eumelanin pigmentation. The main reason for the evolution of dark pigmentation was to protect against folate deficiency caused by elevated demands for folate in cell division, DNA repair, and melanogenesis stimulated by UVR. Dispersal out of tropical Africa created new challenges for human physiology especially because of lower and more seasonal levels of UVR and ultraviolet B (UVB) outside of the tropics. In these environments, the challenge of producing a vitamin D precursor in the skin from available UVB was met by natural selection acting on mutations capable of producing varying degrees of depigmentation. The range of pigmentation observed in modern humans today is, thus, the product of two opposing clines, one favoring photoprotection near the equator, the other favoring vitamin D photosynthesis nearer the poles. Recent migrations and changes in lifestyle in the last 500 years have brought many humans into UVR regimes different from those experienced by their ancestors and, accordingly, exposed them to new disease risks, including skin cancer and vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2012 Mar 19;367(1590):785-92. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0308.>doi: 10.1098/rstb.2011.0308.</a></p><h3 id=human-skin-pigmentation-migration-and-disease-susceptibility>Human skin pigmentation, migration and disease susceptibility.</h3><p>Jablonski NG, Chaplin G.</p><p>Source</p><p>Department of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. <a href=mailto:ngi2@psu.edu>ngi2@psu.edu</a></p><p>Abstract</p><p>Human skin pigmentation evolved as a compromise between the conflicting physiological demands of protection against the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthesis of UVB-dependent vitamin D(3). Living under high UVR near the equator, ancestral Homo sapiens had skin rich in protective eumelanin. Dispersals outside of the tropics were associated with positive selection for depigmentation to maximize cutaneous biosynthesis of pre-vitamin D(3) under low and highly seasonal UVB conditions. In recent centuries, migrations and high-speed transportation have brought many people into UVR regimes different from those experienced by their ancestors and, accordingly, exposed them to new disease risks. These have been increased by urbanization and changes in diet and lifestyle. Three examples-nutritional rickets, multiple sclerosis (MS) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM)-are chosen to illustrate the serious health effects of mismatches between skin pigmentation and UVR. The aetiology of MS in particular provides insight into complex and contingent interactions of genetic and environmental factors necessary to trigger lethal disease states. Low UVB levels and vitamin D deficiencies produced by changes in location and lifestyle pose some of the most serious disease risks of the twenty-first century.</p><p>J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2012 Nov 16. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span></p><h3 id=maternal-serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-measures-of-newborn-and-placental-weight-in-a-us-multicenter-cohort-study>Maternal Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Measures of Newborn and Placental Weight in a U.S. Multicenter Cohort Study.</h3><p>Gernand AD, Simhan HN, Klebanoff MA, Bodnar LM.</p><p>Source</p><p>Department of Epidemiology (A.D.G.), University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, and Departments of Epidemiology and Obstetrics and Gynecology (L.M.B.), University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261; Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (H.N.S.), Magee-Womens Hospital and Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213; and Departments of Pediatrics and of Obstetrics and Gynecology (M.A.K.), Ohio State University College of Medicine and The Research Institute, Nationwide Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio 43210.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Context:Inconsistent associations between maternal vitamin D status and fetal size have been published in small studies.Objective:Our objective was to examine the association between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and measures of newborn and placental weight.Design and Setting:We measured maternal 25(OH)D in mothers from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, an observational cohort conducted in 12 U.S. medical centers from 1959 to 1965.Participants:Women delivering singleton, term, live births with 25(OH)D measured at a gestation of 26 wk or less (n = 2146).Main Outcome Measures:Birth weight, ponderal index, placental weight, the placental to fetal weight ratio, and small for gestational age were measured.

Increased mortality in patients with low serum concentrations of S-25(OH)D has been described, though no causal relationship has been shown. The aim of this cohort study was to investigate the possible association between S-25(OH)D status and all-cause mortality in 5,147 patients attending a university hospital in Denmark from 2003-2008. Methods. Serum was analyzed for ionized calcium (S-Ca(2+)), parathyroid hormone (S-PTH) and S-25(OH)D. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze the association between S-25(OH)D quartiles, S-PTH-quartiles and all-cause mortality. Cox regression analyzed associations of age, gender, concentrations of ionized calcium, S-PTH and S-25(OH)D with all-cause mortality. Results. Log rank tests for both S-25(OH)D and S-PTH quartiles showed a significant difference across the quartiles. The Cox regression analysis showed a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01; 1.03) for S-PTH per pmol/L increase, 1.07 (95% CI: 1.05; 1.10) for S-25(OH)D per 10 nmol/L decrease and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.24; 1.20) for S-Ca(2+) per mmol/L increase. Discussion. This study supports growing evidence, that low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D are associated with an increased all-cause mortality; however the nature of the study prevents the finding of a causal relationship. In the Cox regression analysis S-25(OH)D concentrations in the blood were inversely associated with all-cause mortality. Prospective controlled studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship between low S-25(OH)D concentrations and mortality.</p><p>Eur J Nutr. 2012 Aug 12. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span></p><h3 id=vitamin-d-metabolism-functions-and-needs-from-science-to-health-claims>Vitamin D metabolism, functions and needs: from science to health claims.</h3><p>Battault S, Whiting SJ, Peltier SL, Sadrin S, Gerber G, Maixent JM.</p><p>Source</p><p>Équipe de Biologie Moléculaire Marine, PROTÉE, Université du Sud Toulon-Var, BP 20132, Avenue de l&rsquo;Université, 83957, La Garde Cedex, France.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>BACKGROUND:</p><p>Vitamin D is a nutrient long considered as essential for skeletal health but is now attracting interest from medical and nutritional communities as knowledge emerges of its biological function and its association with decreased risk of many chronic diseases.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>A question emerges: How much more vitamin D do we need for these new functions of vitamin D?

Premature death was defined all-cause death at &lt;75 years of age. Results indicated that during an average 8-year follow-up, there were 3,266 deaths (24.9%) including 101 deaths from HF, 1,451 from CVD, and 1,066 premature all-cause deaths. Among HF deaths, 37% of decedents had serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;20 ng/ml, whereas only 26% of those with non-HF deaths had such levels (p &lt;0.001). Multivariate-adjusted Cox model indicated that subjects with serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;20 ng/ml had 2.06 times higher risk (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 4.25) of HF death than those with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥30 ng/ml (p &lt;0.001). In addition, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for premature death from all causes were 1.40 (1.17 to 1.68) in subjects with serum 25(OH)D levels &lt;20 ng/ml and 1.11 (0.93 to 1.33) in those with serum 25(OH)D levels of 20 to 29 ng/ml compared to those with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥30 ng/ml (p &lt;0.001, test for trend).

Evidence addressing this hypothesis is limited, especially for African Americans who have a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. The authors conducted a nested case-control study within the prospective Southern Community Cohort Study to relate baseline serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) with subsequent mortality. Cases were 1,852 participants who enrolled from 2002 to 2009 and died >12 months postenrollment. Controls (n = 1,852) were matched on race, sex, age, enrollment site, and blood collection date. The odds ratios for quartile 1 (&lt;10.18 ng/mL) versus quartile 4 (>21.64 ng/mL) levels of 25(OH)D were 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 2.14) for African Americans and 2.11 (95% CI: 1.39, 3.21) for non-African Americans. The effects were strongest for circulatory disease death, where quartile 1 versus quartile 4 odds ratios were 2.53 (95% CI: 1.44, 4.46) and 3.25 (95% CI: 1.33, 7.93) for African Americans and non-African Americans, respectively. The estimated odds of total mortality were minimized in the 25(OH)D range of 35-40 ng/mL. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that vitamin D status may have an important influence on mortality for both African Americans and non-African Americans.</p><p>Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2012 Nov 1;5(6):819-29. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.112.967604.>doi: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.112.967604.</a> Epub 2012 Nov 13.</p><h3 id=circulating-25-hydroxy-vitamin-d-and-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-a-meta-analysis-of-prospective-studies>Circulating 25-hydroxy-vitamin d and risk of cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.</h3><p>Wang L, Song Y, Manson JE, Pilz S, März W, Michaëlsson K, Lundqvist A, Jassal SK, Barrett-Connor E, Zhang C, Eaton CB, May HT, Anderson JL, Sesso HD.</p><p>Source</p><p>Division of Preventive Medicine.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Background- Vitamin D status has been linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the optimal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>-vitamin D) levels for potential cardiovascular health benefits remain unclear. Methods and Results- We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 through February 2012 for prospective studies that assessed the association of 25(OH)-vitamin D concentrations with CVD risk. A total of 24 articles met our inclusion criteria, from which 19 independent studies with 6123 CVD cases in 65 994 participants were included for a meta-analysis. In a comparison of the lowest with the highest 25(OH)-vitamin D categories, the pooled relative risk was 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.77) for total CVD, 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.71) for CVD mortality, 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.57) for coronary heart disease, and 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.10) for stroke. These associations remained strong and significant when analyses were limited to studies that excluded participants with baseline CVD and were better controlled for season and confounding. We used a fractional polynomial spline regression analysis to assess the linearity of dose-response association between continuous 25(OH)-vitamin D and CVD risk. The CVD risk increased monotonically across decreasing 25(OH)-vitamin D below ≈60 nmol/L, with a relative risk of 1.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.06) per 25-nmol/L decrement in 25(OH)-vitamin D. Conclusions- This meta-analysis demonstrated a generally linear, inverse association between circulating 25(OH)-vitamin D ranging from 20 to 60 nmol/L and risk of CVD. Further research is needed to clarify the association of 25(OH)-vitamin D higher than 60 nmol/L with CVD risk and assess causality of the observed associations.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/asthma.html><span class=tag>asthma</span></a>
