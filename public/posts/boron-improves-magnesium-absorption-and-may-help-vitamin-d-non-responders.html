For the last 4 years I have been using Boron myself in a practice focused on pain mainly due to Arthritis, scarring, collagen thickening etc. The subject has been totally and positively ignored by the medical societies and lay publications, for reasons that I can only assume are due to the fact that it is not patentable or profitable. I hate to even think of the idea of the Borax Conspiracy by Dr. Last however over the last few years I have tried to stimulate enthusiasm, support, double-blind studies etc. with a total blockade.</p><p>In passing it is important to note that Boron is not alone, the N.I.H. carried out a large study of 77,000 people and found that Glucosamine increases longevity, reduces cancer, and many other maladies. Did this hit the headlines? No! for the same reasons- no patent and no profit.</p><p>I became attracted to the literature on the use of Boron after reading the work of Dr. Rex Newnham based on the work from 1965 in Australia. A well-known story of how he observed this as a plant, he evaluated it positively, informed the government who informed Big Pharma, and 2 days later it was declared a poison! He was extruded from Australia. Since the work of Newnham, a number of small double-blind studies have proven the effectiveness of Boron in a range of illnesses from atopic eczema, arthritis, memory improvement, and a possible reduction in certain cancers.</p><p>There have been no reports of side-effects if taken within the recommended dose and this is a normal part of dietary intake, being found in a vast array of foods and water supplies.</p><p>I have tried many angles to get support or interest in this subject, ranging from Arthritis societies that showed no interest or it was below their radar screen, to companies who have to answer to shareholders and would not fund studies. What is disheartening is the fact that paramedical papers, lay journals have totally ignored this. I can see it from their point of view that if one or even more of the positive actions described in “Nothing boring about Boron” was true, it could cause significant financial hardship to drug companies. I have also tried to play the angle to Ministers of Health of the potential savings, the cost of a large double-blind study most likely equals less than a hundred joint replacements.</p><p>The paper deserves close reading as it puts together the majority of actions of Boron that have been described, particularly the effect it has on inflammatory biomarkers. These changes in inflammatory biomarkers firstly mean that this a specific mineral acting as an anti-inflammatory, it explains it’s positive effect working with the body rather than many modern drugs which seem to work in a non-physiological way.</p><p>The spectrum of action of Boron which is an essential micronutrient may open even further indications as this may be a universal non-toxic natural agent that acts as an active agent in many “wear and tear” disorders, chronic inflammatory disorders for which at present the treatments are not without significant side effects and in some cases expensive. Boron is very inexpensive.</p><p>One is always fearful of side effects in agents that have not been tested by large studies however as mentioned in the paper, Boron is found naturally in fruit and water. In actual fact areas with high Boron have positive actions on health.</p><p>This is a must read paper and perhaps I hope it will act as the chink in the blockade to overcome the conspiracy of silence.</p><p><strong>Other by Dr. Russell</strong></p><p><a href=https://ca.linkedin.com/in/alan-russell-aa8a8b41>Boron could kill your practice</a> on Linkedin</p><p><a href=/posts/vitamin-d-and-boron>Vitamin D and Boron</a> on VitaminDWiki</p><hr><h4 id=notes-from-pdf>Notes from PDF</h4><ul><li><p>39% increase in vitamin D levels when going from low Boron diet to boron replete diet</p><ul><li>3 mg of Boron/day for 49 days</li></ul></li><li><p>Speculation that Boron helps vitamin D non-responders is on page 38</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Boron significantly improves magnesium absorption and deposition in bone&rdquo; pg 38</p></li><li><p>Osteo Arthritis incidence (page 39)</p><ul><li><p>0% - 10% if Boron intake 3-10 mg</p></li><li><p>20% to 70% if Boron intake &lt; 1 mg</p></li></ul></li><li><p>To benefit from Boron need > 3 mg/day</p></li><li><p>Boron Increases Half-life . . . of Vitamin D&rdquo;</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>perhaps by suppressing the activity of 24-hydroxylase</p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=observation-and-action-by-henry-lahore--vitamindwiki>Observation and action by Henry Lahore @ VitaminDWiki</h4><p>For the past 5 years I have wondered about the benefits of Boron</p><p>I have been taking 3 mg Boron daily (along with Silicon and Magnesium) to have healthy teeth and bones.</p><p>This article indicates that Boron has synergistic benefits with both vitamin D and Magnesium</p><p>       Provided that more than 3 milligrams of Boron are taken daily</p><p>       Hmmm!
