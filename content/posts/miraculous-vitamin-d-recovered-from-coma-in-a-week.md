* Algerian boy was very sick and got injections of amoxicillin and Solumedrol, got hemiplegia 

* Went to hospital and then fell into a coma

* His father, who is a Naturopathy student, recommended Vitamin D

* After 6 days of Vitamin D injections (1,157,000 IU total) he became fully conscious

> Note: injections were probably needed since the naso-gastric probe was not already set up (installed).

* The paralysis  was quickly eliminated by a diet which was high in protein 

> Used organic eggs or organic egg yokes (which also have Omega-3)

> Both of which have >3X higher levels of vitamin (as D3 and semiactivated) and Vitamin K2

* The boy left the hospital 30 days after entering

* pg 20, 21: the optimal dose of vitamin d for each comatose patient ( as example : see the given table).

* pg 26, 27: more scientific evidences about effictiveness of vitamin d3 in strokes (paragraph14).

* pg 32: how can we do rehabilitation for a paralysed patient with completely affected (injered) limbs.

* pg 41: addition of 02 points in paragraph 28 about creation of a new  assessment  reference  system and ensurance  of  effective  and  broad  spectrum  coverage ...(see also the footnote 99).

<div class="border" style="background-color:#F8E0E6;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:600px">

Because D3 vitamin is for sure now a guarantee for health and life insurance (see the above study); and in order to deprive comatose patients of this so-called life insurance, researchers are requested - during their studies and clinical experiments on this vitamin in coma case 

- to proceed as follows :

* Cancel the placebo group.

* Test with good amounts of D3 vitamin and predict a complement for the metabolism of the medication, (if medication is heavy).

* Inject preferably massive doses (50,000 IU or more) and periodically (every 6 or 8 hours) during the first day to reach quickly the ideal range of disease curing (83-130 ng / ml) and, therefore, to shorten greatly the awakening duration.

* Give good stimulation of the placebo effect, especially for comatose whose GCS ≤ 8.

* Compare results only with earlier statistics (Previous months, previous year ...), and draw conclusions towards the end!

* I also call for solidarity, unity and cooperation of all: officials, conventional doctors, natural doctors, owners and managers of pharmaceutical firms, researchers, journalists, ... to spreading out this study unto all hospitals, for a work headed by a senior official, such as a minister or even of higher rank in the country, to give a big impetus to this study against death and time!

* It is with this approach that I strongly hope to see the progress of this scientific study going forward!

#### [Coma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma#Prognosis) Wikipedia Jan 2017

* “Comas can last from several days to several weeks. In more severe cases a coma may last for over five weeks, while some have lasted as long as several years. After this time, some patients gradually come out of the coma, some progress to a vegetative state, and others die”

* “People may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention.  **Recovery usually occurs gradually—patients acquire more and more ability to respond** . Some patients never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness.[21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma#cite_note-21) Regaining consciousness is not instant: in the first days, patients are only awake for a few minutes, and duration of time awake gradually increases.”
