An increasing number of studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes in mothers, neonates and children. 

There are no representative country data available on vitamin D status of pregnant women in Europe. 

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Belgian pregnant women and to assess the determinants of vitamin D status in the first and third trimester of pregnancy. The women were selected via a multi-stage proportionate-to-size sampling design. Blood samples were collected and a questionnaire was completed face-to-face. 

55 obstetric clinics were randomly selected and 1311 pregnant women participated in the study. 

The median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25-(OH)D]</span> concentration was significantly lower in the first trimester (20.4 ng/ml) than in third trimester (22.7 ng/ml). Of all women, 74.1% (95%CI = 71.8–76.5%) were vitamin D insufficient (25-(OH)D <30 ng/ml), 44.6% (95%CI = 41.9–47.3%) were vitamin D deficient (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml), while 12.1% (95%CI = 10.3–13.8%) were severely vitamin D deficient (25-(OH)D <10 ng/ml). 

Of all women included, 

* 62.0% reported taking vitamin D-containing multivitamins, of which 

* only 24.2% started taking those before pregnancy. 

The risk of vitamin D deficiency (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml) was significantly higher for  **less educated women and women who reported not going on holidays to sunny climates** . 

The risk of severe vitamin D deficiency (25-(OH)D <10 ng/ml)  **decreased**  for women who 

* reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy, decreased with 

* more frequent use of sunscreen lotion and 

* increased for smokers and women who reported 

* preference for shadow. 

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women in Belgium and this raises concerns about the health consequences for the mother and the offspring. A targeted screening strategy to detect and treat women at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency is needed in Belgium and in Europe.
