Background: Given the sparse data on vitamin D status in pediatric COVID-19, we investigated whether vitamin D deficiency could be a risk factor for susceptibility to COVID-19 in  **Egyptian children and adolescents.**  We also investigated whether vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI polymorphism could be a genetic marker for COVID-19 susceptibility.

Methods: One hundred and eighty patients diagnosed to have COVID-19 and 200 matched control children and adolescents were recruited. Patients were laboratory confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by real-time RT-PCR. All participants were genotyped for VDR Fok1 polymorphism by RT-PCR. Vitamin D status was defined as sufficient for serum 25(OH) D at least 30 ng/mL, insufficient at 21-29 ng/mL, deficient at <20 ng/mL.

Results: Ninety-four patients (52%) had low vitamin D levels with 74 (41%) being deficient and 20 (11%) had vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with 2.6-fold increased risk for COVID-19 (OR = 2.6; <span>[95% CI 1.96-4.9]</span>; P = 0.002. The FokI FF genotype was significantly more represented in patients compared to control group (OR = 4.05; <span>[95% CI: 1.95-8.55]</span>; P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and VDR Fok I polymorphism may constitute independent risk factors for susceptibility to COVID-19 in Egyptian children and adolescents.

Impact: Vitamin D deficiency could be a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19 in children and adolescents because of its immune-modulatory action. To our knowledge, ours is the first such study to investigate the VDR Fok I polymorphism in Caucasian children and adolescents with COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency and the VDR Fok I polymorphism may constitute independent risk factors for susceptibility to COVID-19 in Egyptian children and adolescents. Clinical trials should be urgently conducted to test for causality and to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 taking into account the VDR polymorphisms.

##### Case definition

One hundred and eighty patients aged <19 years who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 at the study hospitals were recruited. All patients were laboratory confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

Patients' COVID-19 illness severity was categorized into moderate, severe, and critical subgroups according to the recently published classification by Chen et al.20

No asymptomatic or mild cases were seen among our cohort.

* (I)	Moderate: included (134) cases presented with pneumonia (lower respiratory symptoms plus fever >38 Â°C and age-specific tachypnea);

* (II)	Severe COVID-19: included (31) cases who rapidly develop dyspnea, hypoxia (arterial oxygen saturation <93%), dehydration with feeding difficulty, elevated liver enzymes, disturbed consciousness, coagulation dysfunction;

* (III)	Critically ill cases: included (15) patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring for acute respiratory failure (ARF), mechanical ventilation (partial arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2](PaO2/FiO2) ratio <300 despite oxygen therapy), septic shock, or organ failure.

Patients were admitted within 72 h from onset of fever and cough. Pulmonary high-resolution computed tomographic images were routinely performed for all patients and evaluated by two experienced radiologists (S.F.O. and A.S.M.) who were blinded to the patients' clinical data.

##### Control group

Two hundred healthy children and adolescents of matched age, sex, and season at enrollment who underwent pre-operative assessment for elective surgery at the study hospitals were enrolled as a control group (all tested negative for SARS-Cov2 by RT-PCR and had negative anti-N antibodies test for SARS-Cov2).

All patients and control subjects belong to the same ethnic group: African Caucasian.

##### Exclusion criteria

Patients with obesity, malnutrition, immunodeficiency, congenital heart disease, malignancy, metabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, or any chronic debilitating disease were excluded. Those who received vitamin D, calcium, multi-vitamin, or mineral supplementation during the previous 6 months were also excluded.
