Over the last decades, epidemiology and functional studies have started to reveal a pivotal role of vitamin D in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Acting through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), vitamin D regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic islets and insulin sensitivity in multiple peripheral metabolic organs. In vitro studies and both T1D and T2D animal models showed that vitamin D can improve glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin secretion, reducing inflammation, reducing autoimmunity, preserving beta cell mass, and sensitizing insulin action. 

Conversely, vitamin D deficiency has been shown relevant in increasing T1D and T2D incidence. While clinical trials testing the hypothesis that vitamin D improves glycemia in T2D have shown conflicting results, subgroup and meta-analyses support the idea that raising serum vitamin D levels may reduce the progression from prediabetes to T2D.

In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of vitamin D in insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and immunity, as well as the observational and interventional human studies investigating the use of vitamin D as a treatment for diabetes.

#### 6 Reasons that medical professionals do not prescribe Vitamin D for Diabetes

1. No profit for Big Pharma

> [Diabetes - A Lucrative Disease April 2023](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/diabetes-a-lucrative-disease-86c7b78c)

1. Less income for doctors or hospitals if stop diabetes

1. The Vitamin D dose needed often varies by 4X between individuals for many health problems

> Doctors prefer using a single dose of a drug for all patients

1. Doctors are unaware that small doses of vitamin D  gut-friendly can be used

> [Gut-Friendly Vitamin D](/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d) is available on Amazon, but not in pharmacies, nor by prescription

> they are uncomfortable prescribing 4,000+ IU of vitamin D

> in many countries, doctors can only prescribe D2 (which does not work as well), not D3

1. Doctors are unaware that adding Magnesium helps prevent/treat Diabetes

> they often just want to use  a monotherapy

1. Doctors are unaware that sometimes the Vitamin D Receptors also need to be activated
