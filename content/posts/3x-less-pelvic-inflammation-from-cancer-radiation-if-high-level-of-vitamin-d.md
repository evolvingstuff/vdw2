Purpose

Radiation-induced injury to the normal tissues is a common complication of radiotherapy in cancer patients. Considering the role of vitamin D in mucosal barrier hemostasis and inflammatory responses, we investigated whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of radiation-induced acute proctitis in cancer patients.

Methods and Materials

This prospective observational study was conducted on cancer patients referred for pelvic radiotherapy. Serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured before radiotherapy. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of <35 nmol/L and <40 nmol/L in males and females patients, respectively, based on available normative data. Acute proctitis was assessed after five weeks of radiotherapy (total received radiation dose of 50 Grays) and graded from 0 to 4 using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) classification.

Results

Ninety eight patients with mean age of 62.8 ± 9.1 years (57.1% male) were studied. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 57 (58.1%) patients. Symptoms of acute proctitis were occurred in 72 (73.4%) patients after radiotherapy. The RTOG grade was significantly higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency than normal cases (median <span>[interquartile range]</span> of 2 <span>[0. 5 to 3]</span> vs. 1 <span>[0 to 2]</span>, P=0.037). 

Vitamin D deficiency was associated with RTOG grade of ≥2 independently from possible confounding factors; odds ratio <span>[95% confidence interval]</span> =  **3.07**  <span>[1.27 to 7.50]</span>, P=0.013.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased severity of radiation-induced acute proctitis. Investigating the underlying mechanisms of this association and evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D therapy in preventing radiation-induced acute proctitis is warranted.
