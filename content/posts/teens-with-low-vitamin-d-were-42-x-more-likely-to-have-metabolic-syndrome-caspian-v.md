#### Association of vitamin D status and cardio-metabolic risk factors in children and adolescents: the CASPIAN-V study

BMC Nutr. 2021 Nov 17;7(1):71. [doi: 10.1186/s40795-021-00477-5.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40795-021-00477-5.)

Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) starts from early life and is one of the important underlying factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. Controversial evidence exists on the role of vitamin D deficiency in increasing the risk of pediatric MetS.

Objective: This study aimed to assess the relationship between vitamin D level with MetS and its components in children and adolescents.

Methods: This nationwide cross-sectional study was performed as part of a surveillance program in Iran. Participants were 2596 students, aged 7 to 18 years, living in 30 provinces. In addition to filling questionnaires, a physical examination was conducted, and blood samples were collected. The serum concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured using the direct competitive immunoassay chemiluminescence method.

Results: 2596 students with a mean age of 12.2 y (55.1% boys) were recruited. Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in participants was 10.6% (n = 276), and 60.5% (n = 1570), respectively. The prevalence of MetS was higher in the vitamin D deficient group. Students with deficient vitamin D levels had higher odds of 

* MetS (OR: 4.25, 95%CI: 2.26-7.98), 

* abdominal obesity (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.61-3.12), 

* low HDL-C (OR: 1.65, 95%CI: 1.18-2.30) and 

* high fasting blood sugar (OR: 2.56, 95%CI: 1.43-4.57) 

in comparison to those with sufficient level of vitamin D.

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased odds of MetS and its components in the Iranian pediatric population. These findings underscore the importance of prevention and control of vitamin D deficiency in preventative programs against NCDs.
