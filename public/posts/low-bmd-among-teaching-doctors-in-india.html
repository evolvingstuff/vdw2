Based on Caucasian normative data, osteopenia was noted in 104 (59.7%) males and 27 (67.5%) females. Thirty-two (18.39%) males and five (12.5%) females had osteoporosis. The BMD values of males were 0.947±0.086, 0.911±0.129 and 1.016±0.133 at lumbar spine, femur neck and total hip while those in females were 0.981±0.092, 0.850±0.101 and 0.957±0.103 respectively. BMD of our cohort was lesser by 12.5-18.2% and 4.2-14.5% than the Caucasian and available Indian figures, respectively. BMD had significant positive correlation with weight, height, BMI, physical activity, and dietary calcium phosphorus ratio. 25-(OH)D levels were insufficient in 175 (87.5%) subjects but had no correlation with BMD. <strong>Conclusions</strong> : Young healthy resident doctors had significantly lower BMD, contributors being lower BMI, lower height, reduced bioavailability of dietary calcium and inadequate physical activity.
