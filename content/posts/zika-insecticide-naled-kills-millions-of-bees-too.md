#### [Aimed at Zika Mosquitoes, Spray Kills Millions of Honeybees](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/us/south-carolina-pesticide-kills-bees.html?_r=0) New York Times

Dorchester County (S.C.)  employee failed to mention the spaying to commercial and amateur beekeepers

* " . .federal officials have said the chemical can be harmful to honeybees while also posing brief risks to aquatic invertebrates and terrestrial wildlife."

* "“If you’re killing honeybees, you’re killing a lot of other non-honeybee pollinators, too, and those populations could take a long time to recover.”"

 **Note: The Zika mosquito is not flying while the planes are spraying Naled. It naps during the day, flying and biting only in morning and evening. Bees. however, fly during the day**

> "Those most at risk to its effects are pregnant women, Sass said, meaning Naled would damage the neurological development of fetuses. Sass added that recent studies have shown spraying pesticides in the same chemical class as Naled, even at “legally allowed exposure” levels, is “definitely not safe during early brain development.”"

> Duet contains two  **pyrethroid**  pesticides, Sumithrin and Prallethrin, plus a synergistic compound called piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which boosts the effectiveness of the former two. Sumethrin is an endocrine disruptor, neurotoxin and likely carcinogen, and PBO has been shown to be harmful to the fetal brain, causing "profound developmental defects in children exposed in utero."
