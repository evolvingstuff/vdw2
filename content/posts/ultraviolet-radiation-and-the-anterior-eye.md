Eye Contact Lens. 2011 Jun 10. 

Coroneo M.

From the Department of Ophthalmology, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.

The eye is on the one hand dependent on visible light energy and on the other hand can be damaged by these and the contiguous ultraviolet (UV) and infrared wavelengths. 

Diseases of the eye in which sunlight has been implicated have been termed the ophthalmohelioses, and these conditions pose a significant problem to the eye health of many communities. The ophthalmohelioses have a tremendous impact on patients' quality of life and have significant implications on the cost of health care. 

Although cataract is not entirely caused by insolation, it now seems certain that sunlight plays a contributory role –  **cataract extraction is one of the, if not the most, commonly performed surgical procedures in many societies** . 

Pterygium, typically afflicting a younger population, adds a tremendous burden, both human and financial, in many countries. We review evidence that peripheral light focusing by the anterior eye to the sites of usual locations of pterygium and cataract plays a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Recognition of the light pathways involved with foci at stem cell niches has directed our investigations into inflammatory and matrix metalloproteinase-related pathophysiologic mechanisms. An understanding of the intracellular mechanisms involved has provided some insight into how medical treatments have been developed for the effective management of ocular surface squamous neoplasia. 

The concept of peripheral light focusing has also provided direction in the prevention of these diseases. 

 **This has resulted in improved sunglass design and the further development of UV-blocking contact lenses.**  

With the development of ocular UV fluorescence photographic techniques, we have been able to demonstrate preclinical ocular surface evidence of solar damage. Evidence that diet may play a role in the development of certain conditions is reviewed. 

The conundrum of the public health message about solar exposure is also reviewed, and in this context, the  **potential role of vitamin D deficiency**  is summarized. The eye may play a role in the development of individualized assessment techniques of solar damage, perhaps allowing us to provide better advice to both individuals and populations.

## Definitions

* A pterygium is a non-cancerous growth of the clear, thin tissue that lays over the white part of the eye (conjunctiva)

* The anterior segment is the front third of the eye
