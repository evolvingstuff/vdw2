#### [Hopes of Covid breakthrough as Australian scientists develop antiviral injection to kill 99.9% of the virus in the lungs of mice – but it won't be ready for humans until 2023](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9589611/Queensland-researchers-huge-Covid-19-breakthrough-way-kill-99-9-virus.html)

 **“The new therapy has been designed for people who are already severely ill with Covid, for whom the vaccines are too late. “**

 **I was unaware of this class of therapy - looks promising** 

 **Hopefully the injection will can kill virus in other portions of the body than just the lungs**
