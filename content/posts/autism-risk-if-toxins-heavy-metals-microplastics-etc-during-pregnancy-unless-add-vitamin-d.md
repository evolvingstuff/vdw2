Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) belongs to the group of neurodevelopmental disorders, and has a high prevalence, affecting 1 in 100 children according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO). To be diagnosed with ASD, the child must have persistent deficits in communication and social interactions, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Despite its prevalence, the etiology of ASD is still uncertain, with multifactorial characteristics, including those associated with the gestational period, where maternal exposure to biological, chemical, or physical hazards occurs, some of which have already been proposed as causes of ASD outcomes. Since pregnancy requires a balance between the maternal–fetal binomial, the breakdown of this balance caused by such environmental hazards can lead to altered fetal neurodevelopment, including ASD. With this firmly in mind, this review aims to compile the most recent data on the gestational causes that may be associated with the development of ASD to help health professionals identify risk factors and act for the prevention and management of ASD.
