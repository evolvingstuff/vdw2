OBJECTIVE:

Recently, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risks for preeclampsia and diagnosis of early-onset, severe preeclampsia (EOSPE). The purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between vitamin D levels and  **small-for-gestational age (SGA)**  in patients with EOSPE.

STUDY DESIGN:

Patients with EOSPE were recruited, and demographics, outcomes, and plasma were collected. We assessed 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) by radioimmunoassay and reported our findings in nanograms per milliliter. Results were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation and were reported as median (Q1-Q3).

RESULTS:

In patients with EOSPE (n = 56), 25(OH)D was lower in patients with SGA (16.8 ng/mL; range, 8.9-23 ng/mL) vs normal fetal growth (25.3 ng/mL; range, 16-33 ng/mL; P = .02).  **25(OH)D was correlated significantly with percentile growth at delivery (? = 0.31; P = .02).** 

CONCLUSION:

Vitamin D is lower among patients with SGA in EOSPE than those without growth retardation. We suspect that vitamin D may impact fetal growth through placental mechanisms.
