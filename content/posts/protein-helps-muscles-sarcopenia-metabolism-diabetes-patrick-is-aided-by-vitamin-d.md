#### Is there any association between protein and "vitamin d"? - asked [Perplexity AI Dec 2024](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-any-association-betwe-sgoTfl_oQKCi3rcdPaCOuQ)

There is indeed a significant association between protein and vitamin D, particularly in the context of muscle health and function. This relationship has been the subject of numerous studies, revealing several important connections:

 **Muscle Protein Synthesis** 

Dietary protein intake, especially when rich in leucine (an amino acid abundant in whey protein), combined with vitamin D, plays a crucial role in muscle protein synthesis&nbsp;[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9183069/)&nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35684089/)

This combination is particularly important for maintaining and building muscle mass.

 **Supplementation Effects** 

Research has shown that combining whey protein and vitamin D supplementation can have beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength:

* A 6-week study on healthy, untrained males found that supplementing with 25g of whey protein and 4000 IU of vitamin D3, either before bedtime or after sleeping, resulted in significant improvements in muscle mass and associated blood hormones compared to a control group &nbsp;[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9183069/)&nbsp;[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35684089/)

* Co-supplementation of whey protein and vitamin D has been shown to enhance lean mass gains, muscle strength, and physical function, particularly in healthy older adults&nbsp;[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334153/)

 **Vitamin D Status and Protein Utilization** 

The relationship between protein and vitamin D extends beyond simple co-supplementation:

* Vitamin D status may influence the efficacy of protein supplementation. Normalizing circulating vitamin D concentrations from deficient or insufficient to replete levels may be critical in determining the effectiveness of protein supplementation &nbsp;[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334153/)

* Low vitamin D status is often associated with systemic low-grade inflammation, as reflected by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels &nbsp;[4](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/52/1/260/6586699?login=false)

This inflammation could potentially impact protein metabolism and muscle health.

 **Implications for Specific Populations** 

The protein-vitamin D association appears to have particular relevance for certain groups:

* In older adults, especially those with overweight or obesity, there's often an inadequate intake of both protein and vitamin D&nbsp;[3](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.718658/full)

This deficiency can contribute to age-related muscle loss and decreased function.

* For sarcopenic or frail older adults, whey protein supplementation alone has shown improvements in lean mass and physical function&nbsp;[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334153/)

In conclusion, the association between protein and vitamin D is multifaceted, involving their combined effects on muscle synthesis, strength, and overall function. This relationship is particularly important in the context of aging and muscle health, suggesting that considering both nutrients together may be more beneficial than focusing on either one alone.

#### Founder of VitaminDWiki has been taking Pea & Rice protein daily, and is adding muscle at age 78 - Dec 2024

 **[Orgain 76 cents/ounce](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J074W7Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1?tag=vdw-20)** 

It tastes great. Have been taking it for 60 days so far. (age 78), average 30 g/day

Apparently should have >80 grams TOTAL per day (>1 gram/kg  @ 80 kg) 

I am also doing very intense exercise for 15 minutes daily
