#### Osteoporosis in persons with HIV: a future epidemic?

J La State Med Soc. 2012 May-Jun;164(3):127-30.

Clark R.

Given the aging of the American population with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the high prevalence of suboptimal 25(OH)D (vitamin D) levels, osteoporosis is likely to be a growing concern among clinicians caring for this population. HIV infection has been shown to be a strong predictor for an abnormal dual X-ray absorptionmetry testing and is potentially a risk for fractures at older ages. This paper reviews management issues for osteoporosis specific to the population with HIV, including both prevention and treatment strategies.
