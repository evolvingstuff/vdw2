#### Are Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Deficiency and Insufficiency Risk Factors for the Incidence of Dynapenia?

Epidemiological evidence showing the association between low 25(OH)D and age-related reduction in neuromuscular strength (dynapenia) is a paucity and controversial and, to date, the effect of osteoporosis and vitamin D supplementation on these associations has not been measured. Thus, we analyze whether serum 25(OH)D deficiency and insufficiency are risk factors for the incidence of dynapenia in individuals aged 50 or older and whether osteoporosis or vitamin D supplementation modify these associations. For that, 3205 participants of the ELSA study who were non-dynapenic at baseline were followed for 4 years. Vitamin D was measured at baseline by the serum concentration of 25(OH)D and classified as sufficient (> 50 nmol/L), insufficient (≥ 30 and ≤ 50 nmol/L) or deficient (< 30 nmol/L). The incidence of dynapenia was determined by a grip strength < 26 kg for men and < 16 kg for women at the end of the 4-year follow-up. Poisson regression models were adjusted by sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and biochemical characteristics. Serum 25(OH)D deficient was a risk factor for the incidence of dynapenia (IRR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.04-2.79). When only individuals without osteoporosis and those who did not use vitamin D supplementation were analyzed, both serum 25(OH)D deficiency (IRR = 1.78; 95% CI 1.01-3.13) and insufficiency (IRR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.06-2.94) were risk factors for the incidence of dynapenia. 

In conclusion, a serum level of 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L is a risk factor for the incidence of dynapenia. Among individuals without osteoporosis and those who do not take vitamin D supplementation, the threshold of risk is higher (≤ 50 nmol/L).
