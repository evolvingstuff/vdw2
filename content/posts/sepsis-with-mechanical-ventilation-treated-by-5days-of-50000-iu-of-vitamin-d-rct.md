Background: Critically ill patients with sepsis have a high incidence of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D promotes the synthesis of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, a precursor of LL-37, which is a part of the innate immune system. This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of the early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D3 in comparison with low-dose vitamin D3 in patients with sepsis requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). 

Methods: Eighty adult patients with sepsis requiring MV with known vitamin D deficiency were randomly assigned to receive either an enteral 50 000 IU (Group I) or 5000 IU (Group II) vitamin D supplementation. Clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated at baseline and on days 4 and 7 between the study groups. The change in serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels on day 7 was the primary outcome, while the change in serum LL-37 levels on day 7,  **changes in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA)**  score, and clinical pulmonary infection score on day 7, MV duration, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were the secondary outcomes. 

Results: The (day 7-day 0) change in serum PCT and LL-37 levels and SOFA score were significantly different in Group I (P = .010, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). The SOFA score was significantly different on days 4 and 7 in Group I (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively). The incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia was significantly different between both treatment groups (P = .025). The hospital LOS was shorter in Group I (P < .001). No 25-hydroxyvitamin-D toxicity was observed in either group. 

Conclusions: Early enteral administration of high-dose vitamin D3 in critically ill patients with sepsis requiring MV along with standard treatment for sepsis decreased serum procalcitonin levels, increased serum LL-37 levels, and ameliorated illness severity scores.

#### My 102 year-old father-in-law was in ICU with Sepsis, I gave him 200,000 IU, he was kicked out of ICU 3 days later

His doctors wondered how he recovered to quickly.  I never told them.
