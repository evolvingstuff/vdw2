The US Institute of Medicine made 4 Vitamin D math mistakes in 2010

The IoM finally agreed that they made math mistakes in 2017

Instead of RDA = 600 IU, it should have been 8,800 IU (14X higher)

However, an IoM panel did not want to be embarrassed by publicly admitting mistakes.

The world copied the US mistake of 600 IU

 **$1 trillion math** 

* [Global health spending for 2018](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240017788) =  $8.3 trillion

* [__75%__ reduction in office visits in patients taking lot of vitamin D](/posts/dr-who-got-patients-to-vitamin-d-level-of-80-ng)

* Assume reduce all medical care costs by half

* Assume only half of the people would take lots of vitamin D

* Thus, decrease in health care costs =12%  = half X half X 75%

   * 12% of $8.3 trillion = $1.2 trillion

#### The IOM Miscalculated Its RDA For Vitamin D - GrassrootsHealth March 2024

##### The 2nd panel did not want to publicly admit IoM mistake (or were bribed)

Costs: 

* Medical care

   * [__75%__ reduction in office visits in patients taking ~8,000 IU daily](/posts/dr-who-got-patients-to-vitamin-d-level-of-80-ng)

   * [Global health spending for 2018](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240017788) =  $8.3 trillion

   * Extremely conservative estimate of savings of  **12%**  due to 8,000 IU daily =  **<span style="color:#F00;">$1 trillion</span>** 

* 2X increased incidence of many diseases 

   * Early-onset Cancers, Obesity, MS, Diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc

* Reduced productivity

* Reduced IQ and income, etc.

* Reduced viral infections, such as COVID

   * 8,000 IU would have prevented more than half of the COVID hospitalizations, disabilites, and deaths
