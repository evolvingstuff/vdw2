Background: Vitamin D and its metabolites are believed to impede carcinogenesis by stimulating cell differentiation, inhibiting cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis. Certain pesticides have been shown to deregulate vitamin D's anti-carcinogenic properties. We hypothesize that certain pesticides may be linked to prostate cancer via an interaction with vitamin D genetic variants. 

Methods: We evaluated interactions between 41 pesticides and 152 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine vitamin D pathway genes among 776 prostate cancer cases and 1,444 male controls in a nested case-control study of Caucasian pesticide applicators within the Agricultural Health Study. We assessed interaction P-values using likelihood ratio tests from unconditional logistic regression and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple comparisons. 

Results: Five significant interactions (P<0.01) displayed a monotonic increase in prostate cancer risk with individual pesticide use in one genotype and no association in the other. 

 **These interactions involved parathion and terbufos use and three vitamin D genes (VDR, RXRB and GC)** . The exposure-response pattern among participants with increasing parathion use with the homozygous CC genotype for GC rs7041 compared to unexposed participants was noteworthy (

* low versus no exposure: odds ratio (OR)=2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.07-6.25; 

* high versus no exposure: OR=3.09, 95%CI=1.10-8.68; P-interaction=3.8x10-3). 

Conclusions: In this study, genetic variations in vitamin D pathway genes, particularly  **GC rs7041** , a SNP previously linked to lower circulating vitamin D levels modified pesticide associations with prostate cancer risk. Impact: Because our study is the first to examine this relationship, additional studies are needed to rule out chance findings.
