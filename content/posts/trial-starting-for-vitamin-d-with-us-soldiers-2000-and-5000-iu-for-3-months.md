 **Update: Study Results [5,000 IU Vitamin D daily resulted in many benefits after 3 months (US soldiers) – RCT March 2019](/posts/5000-iu-vitamin-d-daily-resulted-in-many-benefits-after-3-months-us-soldiers-rct)** 

 **<span style="color:#F00;">This Randomized Controlled Trial has many problems</span>** 

1. They are not permitting the soldiers to take >400 IU of vitamin D during the trial

> Many soldiers will probably refuse to take part in the study, as they will not want to decrease their vitamin D intake

1. Three months is barely long enough to restore vitamin D levels

> It will be difficult to notice benefits which might only start in the last few weeks

1. The study will also look at vitamin D levels 9 months after stopping the vitamin D supplementation

> Since the half-life of vitamin D is approximately 2 months there will be ZERO effect 9 months later.

> Note: many doctors still incorrectly feel that once the vitamin D levels are restored that no more is needed
