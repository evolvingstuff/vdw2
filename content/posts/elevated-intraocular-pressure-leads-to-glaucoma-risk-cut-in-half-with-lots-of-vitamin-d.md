Elevated intraocular pressure (EIOP)  **is the only major modifiable risk factor of glaucoma** . While low serum vitamin D levels are considered a potential risk factor for glaucoma, there is conflicting evidence on the relationship between vitamin D and EIOP despite the possible linkage between vitamin D and intraocular pressure through oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to verify the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and EIOP using data from 15,338 individuals who visited the health promotion center of an education hospital. The cubic spline curve revealed an inverse dose-dependent association between serum 25(OH)D level and EIOP. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the EIOP of the serum 25(OH)D per increment was 0.97 (0.96-0.990). 

The fully adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for the EIOP of the 25(OH)D insufficiency and 25(OH)D sufficiency groups, compared to 25(OH)D deficiency group, were 

* 0.72 (0.56-0.92) and 

* 0.51 (0.34-0.78), respectively. 

The relationship remained significant in male and young age subgroups. In conclusion, the clinical assessment of intraocular pressure may prove helpful when treating patients with 25(OH)D deficiency, which may be a preventive strategy against the development of glaucoma.
