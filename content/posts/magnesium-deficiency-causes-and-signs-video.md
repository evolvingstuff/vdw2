3:56 Signs of a magnesium deficiency

4:59 The earliest sign of a magnesium deficiency 

Today, I’m going to share 22 signs of a magnesium deficiency. Sixty percent of magnesium is in the bone, 20% is in the muscle, 19% is in the soft tissue, and 1% is in the blood.

Magnesium deficiency is the most overlooked deficiency because it cannot be detected by a blood test. 

 **The top <span style="color:#00F;">causes</span> of magnesium deficiency include:** 

• Consumption of sugar and refined carbs

• Alcohol consumption 

• Cirrhosis of the liver

• NPK fertilizer leads to crops that are low in magnesium

• Malabsorption from gut inflammation 

• Diuretics 

• PPIs 

• Gastric bypass surgery

• Low vitamin D 

• Inflammation

Diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease are all associated with low magnesium. 

The best sources of magnesium are leafy greens, almonds, and dark chocolate, but some of these foods contain oxalates. Oxalates block the absorption of magnesium. Meat, cheese, and shellfish contain magnesium and do not contain oxalates. 

 **Here are 22 surprising<span style="color:#00F;">signs</span> of magnesium deficiency:** 

• Anxiety

• Insomnia

• Depression

• Migraines

• Restless legs syndrome

• Muscle cramps 

• Fatigue 

• Tourette's syndrome

• Oxidative cholesterol

• High homocysteine levels 

• High blood pressure

• Calcification of the arteries 

• Arrhythmias 

• Stroke

• Metabolic syndrome

• Polycystic ovarian syndrome 

• Kidney stones

• Higher levels of calcium in the blood

• Inflammation

• Nystagmus 

• Asthma 

 **Neuromuscular excitability, or tetany, is the <span style="color:#00F;">number 1 earliest sign</span> of a magnesium deficiency.   
Tetany is a twitching of the muscles, often affecting the left eye.** 

* Magnesium is required for proper nerve function. When you’re deficient, the nerves become more excited, leading to faster nerve impulses.
