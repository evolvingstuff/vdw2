### Recall that the recommended level is often like the minimum wage - just enough to live on

#### Notice how some items have decreased with time and others have increased with time

#### RDA often assumes a healthy Caucasian, of normal weight, who gets exercise, does not smoke, does not have Cancer, eats good food, etc. etc.
