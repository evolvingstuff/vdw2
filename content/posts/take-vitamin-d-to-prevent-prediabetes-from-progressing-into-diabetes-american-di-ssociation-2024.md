#### Vitamin D efficacy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes

Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism  April 2024 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00774-024-01509-3

Tetsuya Kawahara, Yosuke Okada & Yoshiya Tanaka 

It is well known that vitamin D has a profound effect on calcium and bone metabolism, but its influence on other organs (extraskeletal effect) has been proposed. Consistently, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased incidence of various diseases, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as reported by many observational studies. However, there has been no consensus on whether vitamin D deficiency is a causative factor in the incidence of diabetes mellitus. There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at preventing the onset of type 1 diabetes with vitamin D intake. In addition, the results of RCTs evaluating the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation on type 2 diabetes development have been inconsistent. The recent observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses are confirming that vitamin D or active vitamin D administration is effective in preventing the incident of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

##### Conclusion

Observational studies have shown that vitamin D/cod liver oil intake in the infancy period may be effective in prevent­ing the onset of type 1 diabetes. In addition, vitamin D used as adjunctive therapy with insulin may be associated with a protective immunologic effect and slow decline of residual beta cell function in patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes.

RCTs and meta-analyses showed that vitamin D/active vitamin D administration is slightly effective in prevent­ing type 2 diabetes development. Based on these results, the  **American Diabetes Association guidelines 2024 have adopted a policy of “recommending vitamin D and active vitamin D administration for patients with prediabetes to prevent type 2 diabetes development’'** . The results of RCT in prediabetes adults with reduced basal insulin secre­tion, which may provide additional vitamin D benefits, are warranted.

However, prescribing of vitamin D/active vitamin D with delusive belief should be avoided. After prescribing them, we must follow up patients with attention to the appearance of side effects.
