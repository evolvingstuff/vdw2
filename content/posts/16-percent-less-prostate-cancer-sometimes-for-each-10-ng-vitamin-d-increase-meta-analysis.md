OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed literature examining associations of vitamin D (dietary intake, circulating 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D (25(OH)D), and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D (1,25(OH)(2)D) concentrations) with prostate cancer.

METHODS: We searched over 24,000 papers from seven electronic databases (to October 2010) for exposures related to vitamin D. We conducted dose-response random-effects meta-analyses pooling the log odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per change in natural units of each exposure. The I(2) statistic quantified between-study variation due to heterogeneity.

RESULTS: Twenty-five papers were included. In prospective studies, the 

OR per 1,000 IU increase in dietary intake was 1.14 (6 studies; CI: 0.99, 1.31; I (2) = 0%) for total prostate cancer and

0.93 (3 studies; 0.63, 1.39; I (2) = 25%) for aggressive prostate cancer. 

Five case-control studies examined dietary intake, but there was a high degree of inconsistency between studies (I (2) = 49%). 

The OR per 10 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D was 1.04 (14 studies; 0.99, 1.10; I (2) = 0%) for total prostate cancer and 

0.98 (6 studies; 0.84, 1.15; I (2) = 32%) for aggressive prostate cancer. 

The OR per 10 pg/mL increase in 1,25(OH)(2)D was 1.00 (7 studies; 0.87, 1.14; I (2) = 41%) for total prostate cancer and 

0.86 (2 studies; 0.72, 1.02; I (2) = 0%) for aggressive prostate cancer.

CONCLUSION: Published literature provides little evidence to support a major role of vitamin D in preventing prostate cancer or its progression. PMID: 21203822

* In a total of six studies, the OR for a finding of aggressive prostate cancer was  **0.84 for each 10 ng/ml**  increase in dietary intake of 25-hydroxy vitamin D.
