 **Osteomalacia definitions** 

* [Osteomalacia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomalacia) Wikipedia

> "Osteomalacia in children is known as  **rickets** , and because of this, use of the term "osteomalacia" is often restricted to the milder, adult form of the disease"

* Mayo Clinic: Osteomalacia refers to a marked softening of your bones, most often caused by severe vitamin D deficiency

* [Arthritis UK](https://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/conditions/osteomalcia.aspx) Osteomalacia often develops because of a lack of vitamin D. 

> It can cause bone pain and muscle weakness. 

> In children it used to be called rickets, but nowadays it more often affects adults

With the widespread use of measurement of bone mineral density to detect, diagnose, and monitor therapy in the management of osteoporosis, bone histomorphometry has largely been relegated to research settings and academic pursuits. However, bone density measurement cannot distinguish between osteoporosis and other metabolic bone disorders such as different types of osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa, renal osteodystrophy, hypophosphatasia, and Paget's disease of bone. Furthermore, bone density test cannot tell us anything about microarchitecture of bone, tissue level dynamics, bone cellular activity, bone mineralization and bone remodeling, understanding of which is essential to make a specific diagnosis of a suspected metabolic bone disease, to evaluate beneficial (or adverse) effects of various therapies, treatment (medical or surgical) decisions in hyperparathyroid states. As a research tool, bone histomorphometry contributed immensely to our understanding of bone biology, revolutionized the study of the mechanism of actions of various therapies, and provided crucial understanding of the adverse effects of drugs.

#### A few of the occurrences of  **Vitamin D**  in the PDF

* “The history is highly suggestive of osteomalacia due to  **vitamin D**  deficiency considering the poor intake of calcium and  **vitamin D** …”

* “Although the biochemical findings are suggestive of severe  **vitamin D**  deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism, no specific cause for  **vitamin D**  deficiency was found.”

* “A diagnosis was made of severe nutritional  **vitamin D**  deficiency osteomalacia due to poor calcium and  **vitamin D**  intake and the lack of sunlight exposure because of progressive debility.”

* “The dose of  **vitamin D**  was progressively reduced as her serum alkaline phosphatase and PTH levels returned towards normal and serum 25-hydroxy **vitamin D**  levels increased. Within 2-3 months, her symptoms improved dramatically and she was able to ambulate without a cane”

* “Fourth, if  **vitamin D**  deficiency osteomalacia is not detected early, there is irreversible cortical bone loss (Parfitt et al., 1985a) and increased life-time fracture risk”

* “Worldwide, nutritional  **vitamin D**  deficiency remains the most common cause of osteomalacia, numerically the most frequent, and occurs almost exclusively in parts of the world where  **vitamin D**  deficiency is endemic (Bhan et al., 2010; Basha et al., 2000a)”

* “The two principle mechanisms by which osteomalacia develops are:  **vitamin D**  deficiency (nutritional or malabsorption), as adequate  **vitamin D**  is required for mineralization of newly laid down matrix….”

* “fter the discovery of  **vitamin D** , it became obvious that almost all “bone softening” conditions were due to  **vitamin D**  deficiency, and by implication, osteomalacia became synonymous with any condition that could be cured by  **vitamin D**  but not necessarily caused by its deficiency.”

* “Nutritional  **vitamin D**  deficiency osteomalacia, as defined, occurs only when the serum 25-hydroxy **vitamin D**  level falls below 10ng/ml,…”

* “Distinction between different types of osteomalacia is important since not all varieties respond to  **vitamin D**  therapy”

* “All patients with  **vitamin D**  deficiency osteomalacia have serum 25-hydroxy **vitamin D**  levels < 10ng/ml, but not all with low 25-hydroxy **vitamin D**  levels have osteomalacia”
