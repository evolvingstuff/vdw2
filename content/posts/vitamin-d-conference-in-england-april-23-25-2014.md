## [Vitamin D and Human Health: From the Gamete to the Grave](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/vitamind/)

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/london-d.jpg" alt="image">

This conference will bring together international experts in the vitamin D field to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest clinical evidence relating to the effects of vitamin D on human health throughout the life course.

Our meeting has two aims.

 **First** , we will create a forum for  **<span style="color:#00F;">clinical trialists, epidemiologists and health services researchers</span>**  to meet and forge new collaborations, with the potential to advance the field by the establishment of new consortia for individual patient data meta-analysis.

 **Second,**  we will provide  **<span style="color:#00F;">practicing clinicians, public health professionals, nutritionists and policy-makers</span>**  with a state-of-the-art overview of the latest findings from clinical research in this rapidly evolving field to inform their day-to-day practice.

We anticipate that this event will attract a large international audience of vitamin D researchers and interested clinicians: our venue will accommodate 400 delegates.

### Request for Abstracts Aug 31, 2013

Dear Colleague,

I am writing to let you know that registration for the London meeting on Vitamin D and Human Health is open, and that we are now accepting abstracts for oral and poster presentation.

All abstracts will be reviewed by the Programme Committee, and those ranked highest in terms of scientific merit, originality and interest to a clinical audience will be promoted for oral presentation. 

The meeting will have a strong clinical focus, and priority will be given to abstracts which present data from clinical studies involving human subjects.

Abstracts submitted by trainees (i.e. undergraduates, PhD students, post-docs or clinical trainees) will be eligible to enter the competition for New Investigator Awards. 

The number and value of these awards is dependent on our success in obtaining sponsorship, but we anticipate that several awards of £1,000 will be made.

The deadline for abstract submission, and for the early-bird discount on the registration fee, is  **6<sup>th</sup> December 2013** 

Further details about the meeting, including the conference programme and social events, are available at [http://www.qmul.ac.uk/vitamind/](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/vitamind/).

The abstract submission form can be downloaded from [http://www.qmul.ac.uk/vitamind/files/113164.pdf](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/vitamind/files/113164.pdf).
