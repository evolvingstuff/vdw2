It appears that about **1 person in 300** people has an allergic-type reaction to vitamin D within days.

(Have no specific reference - it is just an impression from reading 12,000+ articles on vitamin D)

The allergic reaction may include itchy skin, hives, and intestinal upset.

#### The reaction is real, and the cause varies

 **Possible reasons and solutions** 

1. The reaction is typically due to a lack of Magnesium - Mg is required by Vitamin D

> Solution take [Magnesium supplement](/tags/magnesium-supplement.html) for a week and try again

1. It might be similar to [reaction to the sun](/posts/photosensitivity-sun-allergy-and-vitamin-d) - probably previously known

> [Red-heads](/posts/redhead-red-hair-vitamin-d) and others - try a smaller dose initially

> See also [Photosensitivity (sun allergy) and vitamin D](/posts/photosensitivity-sun-allergy-and-vitamin-d)

1. Does size too big - at least initially

> Perhaps we need to start with a smaller dose, say 1000 IU, and get used to vitamin D for a week or so

1. Might be a reaction to Vitamin D2 [Vets determined that D2 should not be given to any mammals](/posts/overview-veterinary-and-vitamin-d)

> Solution - use Vitamin D3, not D2

1. The reaction by the gut

> Try a  **[sublingual](/posts/sublingual-vitamin-d)** form

> Try a  **[gut friendly or topical](/posts/low-cost-vitamin-d-including-liquid-and-bulk)**  form

> Try a vitamin D patch on the skin

> Try a processed form (calcitriol, etc.) - click on the chart below for details

> Try an injection (lasts longer) - click on the chart below for details

1. Reaction to the fillers (oil, etc.), additives, coloring, the gelatin capsule

> Try a pure and clean form such as by [Bio-Tech Pharmacal](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

1. [Rare reaction to Wool/Lanolin](/posts/perhaps-wool-allergy-is-the-cause-of-some-vitamin-d-allergy)

> Try a [plant form of D3](/posts/vitamin-d3-for-vegans-many-studies)

1. Extremely rare reaction to Vitamin D3 in regular/processed forms

> Use sun or UV bulb to generate Vitamin D in your skin - click on the chart below for details

1. [Interaction of vitamin D with a prescription drug](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=59&sort_mode=created_desc) is very rare to have a drug reaction

#### Perspective: 3X more likely to be allergic to Aspirin than to Vitamin D

The reaction by the gut

Reaction to additives, fillers, colors, etc.

Rare reaction to Wool

Extremely rare reaction to Vitamin D in any form
