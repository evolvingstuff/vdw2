Background/Aim: This paper reviews ecological studies of the ultraviolet-B (UVB)–vitamin D–cancer hypothesis based on geographical variation of cancer incidence and/or mortality rates. 

Materials and Methods: The review is based largely on three ecological studies of cancer rates from the United States; one each from Australia, China, France, Japan, and Spain; and eight multicountry, multifactorial studies of cancer incidence rates from  **more than 100 countries** . 

 **Results:** 

This review consistently found strong inverse correlations with solar UVB for 15 types of cancer: 

* bladder, 

* breast, 

* cervical, 

* colon, 

* endometrial, 

* esophageal, 

* gastric, 

* lung, 

* ovarian, 

* pancreatic, 

* rectal, 

* renal, and 

* vulvar cancer; and 

* Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

 **Weaker evidence**  exists for nine other types of cancer: 

brain, gallbladder, laryngeal, oral/pharyngeal, prostate, and thyroid cancer; leukemia; melanoma; and multiple myeloma. 

Conclusion: The evidence for the UVB–vitamin D–cancer hypothesis is very strong in general and for many types of cancer in particular.
