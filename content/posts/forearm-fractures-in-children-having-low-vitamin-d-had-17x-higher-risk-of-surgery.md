 **| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vitamin D  | Operation | Needed <br>operative management |
| < 20 ng | 50 % | 29 % |
| 20-30 ng | 17 % | 7 % |** 

 **Note - would be far fewer if child had vitamin D level > 40 ng.** 

 **Many children having a good level of vitamin D would not even get a fracture**
