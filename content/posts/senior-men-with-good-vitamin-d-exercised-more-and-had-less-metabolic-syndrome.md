Objective: Older people are more prone to vitamin D deficiency than younger populations. Individual lifestyle factors have been associated with vitamin D status. We examined the influence of a combination of lifestyle factors on vitamin D status in older men.

Participants and measurements: In a population-based cohort study of older men (age ≥65 years), a lifestyle score was calculated from eight prudent health-related behaviours (smoking, exercise, alcohol, fish and meat consumption, adding salt, milk choices and obesity) collected via questionnaire at baseline. Blood samples were collected 5 years afterwards to measure plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels. Associations between lifestyles and the likelihood of having plasma 25OHD levels of ≥75 versus <75 nmol/L and ≥50 versus <50 nmol/L were tested using logistic regression models.

Results: Of the 2717 men analysed, mean plasma 25OHD was 69.0 ± 23.5 nmol/L, with 20.7% having plasma 25OHD <50 nmol/L. Men engaging in ≥4 healthy lifestyle behaviours had 20% higher odds of plasma 25OHD ≥75 nmol/L (adjusted OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) compared to those with <4 healthy behaviours. No association was found for 25OHD ≥50 nmol/L. 

Higher physical activity was the only individual component significantly associated with vitamin D sufficiency (highest vs. lowest quintiles of physical activity, adjusted OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.47-2.74 for 25OHD ≥50 nmol/L, adjusted  **OR = 2.35** , 95% CI: 1.81-3.06 for 25OHD ≥75 nmol/L).

Conclusion: Multiple healthy lifestyle behaviours are associated with better vitamin D status in older men. Further work is needed to determine the effects of promoting healthy lifestyle behaviours, including physical activity, on vitamin D sufficiency.
