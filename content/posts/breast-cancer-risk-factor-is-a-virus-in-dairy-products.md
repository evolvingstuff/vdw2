#### Bovine Leukemia Virus as a Cause of Breast Cancer - Dr. Greger March 2022

 **[As many as<span style="color:#F00;">37 percent</span> of breast cancer cases may be attributable to exposure to bovine leukemia virus](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/bovine-leukemia-virus-as-a-cause-of-breast-cancer/?mc_cid=2710b228e7&mc_eid=b95641625a%20) YouTube** 

* 40 years ago'''"only about 1 in 10 U.S. dairy cows were infected, but now it’s closer to half"

* "We’ve long known that countries with the highest milk consumption also had the highest breast cancer incidence. "

* "Individual women who are lactose intolerant and consume less dairy also seem to have decreased risk of breast cancer. "

* " But it wasn’t until 2015 that we learned infection rates were highest in cancerous breast tissue, so much so that as many as 37 percent of breast cancer cases may be attributable to exposure to the bovine leukemia virus."

##### Bovine Leukemia Virus as a Cause of Breast Cancer part 2

 **[March 9](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/breast-cancer-and-the-bovine-leukemia-virus-in-meat-and-dairy/?mc_cid=0694635b6a&mc_eid=b95641625a)** 

* "All in all, six of the eight studies performed to date found the virus in human breast tissues, which suggests strongly that BLV does infect humans, and breasts can be targets of infection. Four of the five studies that were able to compare infection rates in cancerous tissue versus normal breast tissue found the odds of finding the virus in the tumors was, on average, four times higher."

* " If you go on hormone replacement for five years, you can bump up your breast cancer risk 30 percent. If you take the pill for more than a dozen years, your risk may go up 40 percent. If you’re obese when you’re older, your risk can go up 60 percent. Having a first-degree relative with breast cancer may double your risk.  **But having your breast infected with bovine leukemia virus may quadruple your risk.**  "

* "Researchers also discovered that the virus comes first, present in some breast tissues 3 to 10 years before cancer was diagnosed"

* "Twenty-one nations have eradicated BLV from their dairy cattle. In contrast, in the  **U.S. the BLV prevalence just keeps going up.** "
