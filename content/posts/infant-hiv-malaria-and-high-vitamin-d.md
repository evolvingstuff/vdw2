High mortality if > 30 ng of vitamin D + HIV + Malaira

 **What caused the vitamin D levels to be so high?** 

Very unlikely to be due to supplementation or food

Does some medicine increases vitamin D levels?

Is there a problem with low Iron? See web

Studies have shown that vitamin D treats both HIV and Malaira separately

BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator, but its impact on morbidity and mortality among infants remains unclear.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of the study was to prospectively assess the association of vitamin D status with mortality, morbidity, and growth during the first 2 y of life.

METHODS:

A prospective cohort of 253 HIV-infected and 948 HIV-exposed Tanzanian infants enrolled in a randomized trial of multivitamins (not including vitamin D) was studied. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations were measured at 5-7 wk of age and infants were followed at monthly clinic visits until 24 mo. Physicians performed a clinical exam every 3 mo or when an illness was noted.

RESULTS:

Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were (means ± SDs) 18.6 ± 10.3 ng/mL and 18.1 ± 9.2 ng/mL for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants, respectively. Unexpectedly, serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥30 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher mortality as compared to the 20-29.9 ng/mL reference for HIV-infected (HR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.13, 5.44; P = 0.02) and HIV-exposed (HR: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.67, 9.58; P < 0.01) infants after multivariate adjustment. We found no statistically significant association between 25(OH)D concentrations <10 ng/mL and mortality for HIV-infected (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 0.74, 2.78; P = 0.29) and HIV-exposed (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.60, 4.03; P = 0.36) infants. Among HIV-exposed infants, 25(OH)D concentrations ≥30 ng/mL were significantly associated with clinical <span>[incidence ratio rate (IRR): 1.34; 95% CI: 1.06,1.70; P = 0.02]</span> and confirmed (IRR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.71; 1.15, 2.54; P < 0.01) malaria diagnoses, whereas concentrations of <10 ng/mL were associated with oral candidiasis (IRR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.00-2.15; P = 0.046) and wasting (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.43; P < 0.01).

CONCLUSION:

The observational design of this study does not allow for causal interpretation; however, the results indicate a strong need for additional studies of vitamin D among HIV-infected and -exposed children, particularly in malaria-endemic settings. The parent trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00197730.
