 **Highlights** 

•We review studies using rodent models of vitamin D deficiency.

•Prenatal vitamin D deficiency alters brain development.

•Adult vitamin D deficiency alters behaviour.

Vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as an environmental risk factor for several neurological disorders. To investigate the biological plausibility of this risk factor, vitamin D (DVD) deficiency rodent models have been used to examine the impact of DVD deficiency on neurobiology and behaviour. The majority of these studies have taken a developmental stance and examined the impact of vitamin D deficiency during gestation on the adult behaviour of the  **offspring** . 

In the  **rat** , the most constant behavioural phenotypes include 

* hyperlocomotion in response to novelty, 

* psychostimulant sensitively, 

* impulsivity, and 

* augmented motivation. 

However, in the  **mouse**  

* increased exploratory behaviour and 

* motivational alterations are observed. 

Researchers have also examined the affect of  **adult**  vitamin D deficiency in rodents. 

The resultant behavioural alterations include 

* increased exploratory activity and 

* impulsivity in the  **rat** , 

While 

* increased hyperlocomotion and 

* sensory sensitivity is observed in the  **mouse** . 

Thus, both the developing and adult brain are sensitive to dietary vitamin D status. However, the behavioural alterations are  **subtle**  and influenced by factors such as species, strain, sex, and age. This illustrates the amenability and complexity of neurobiological systems that are influenced by vitamin D status. Nonetheless, with increasing evidence for epidemiological associations between neuropathological disorders and vitamin D, carefully designed rodent models are well placed as a tool to explore the neurobiological and behavioural domains that may be sensitive to vitamin D.
