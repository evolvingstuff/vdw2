In this study, we used information from 337,484 UK Biobank participants and performed PheWAS using schizophrenia genetic risk score on 1135 disease outcomes. Signals that passed the false discovery rate threshold were further analyzed for evidence of the causality of the association. We extended the analysis to 30 serum, four urine, and six neuroimaging biomarkers to identify biomarkers that could be affected by schizophrenia.

However, we did not find association with any of the brain imaging markers. Our analyses confirmed the co-existence of schizophrenia with other mental health disorders but did not otherwise suggest strong effects on disease risk. Biomarker analyses reflected associations which could be explained by unhealthy lifestyles, suggesting patients with schizophrenia may benefit from screening for and managing broader health aspects.</p><hr><h5 id=2-related-mental-health-studies>2 related mental health studies</h5><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/anxiety-depression-and-suicide-have-recently-surged-note-vitamin-d-omega-3-and-magnesium-help style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Anxiety, depression, and suicide have recently surged (Note: Vitamin D, Omega-3, and Magnesium help) – May 2022">Anxiety, depression, and suicide have recently surged (Note: Vitamin D, Omega-3, and Magnesium help) – May 2022</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/bipolar-disorder-may-be-related-to-cellular-not-blood-vitamin-d style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Bipolar Disorder may be related to cellular, not blood Vitamin D">Bipolar Disorder may be related to cellular, not blood Vitamin D</a></p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=season-of-birth-increased-risk-of-schizophrenia-by-5---meta-analysis-feb-2023>Season of birth increased risk of Schizophrenia by 5% - Meta-analysis Feb 2023</h4><p><strong>Systematic review and meta-analysis: Season of birth and schizophrenia risk</strong></p><p>Schizophrenia Research Volume 252, February 2023, Pages 244-252 <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2022.12.016>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2022.12.016</a></p><p>Samantha M.

Major hypotheses regarding the potential etiological risk factors for schizophrenia such as vitamin D deficiency and virus exposure in utero are predicated based on the observation that risk of schizophrenia is higher in children born in winter months.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the association between season and month of birth and risk of schizophrenia. We further investigated this relationship stratified by hemisphere.</p><p>Results</p><p>Forty-three studies spanning 30 countries and territories and 440,039 individuals with schizophrenia were included in this meta-analysis. Winter births were associated with a small but statistically significant increased risk of schizophrenia (OR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.03–1.07, p &lt; 0.0001) and summer births were associated with a small but statistically significant decreased risk of schizophrenia (OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.94–0.98, p = 0.0001). Stratified subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant difference between hemispheres in the risk of schizophrenia for either winter or summer births.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Analysis using birth month data demonstrated a clear seasonal trend towards increased risk of schizophrenia being associated with winter birth months and decreased risk of schizophrenia in summer-to-fall months in the Northern but not Southern Hemisphere. These data suggest a small-but-substantial increased risk of schizophrenia in winter birth month. Further research needs to examine potential etiologic causes for this association.</p><hr><h4 id=prenatal-vitamin-d-might-decrease-schizophrenia-incidence-by-30---2019>Prenatal Vitamin D might decrease Schizophrenia incidence by 30% - 2019</h4><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/prenatal-vitamin-d-for-schizophrenia.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=nac-treats-schizophrenia-slightly-better-than-vitamin-d-review-of-17-rct--may-2022>NAC treats Schizophrenia slightly better than vitamin D (review of 17 RCT) – May 2022</h4><p><strong>The efficacy of nutritional supplements for the adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Psychiatry Research, May 2022, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114500>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114500</a> $36 paywall</p><p>XianrongXua#GeShaoab#XuZhangaYanHuaJiaHuangcYousongSucMinZhangcYiyunCaidHuipingZhoue</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul><li><p>Compared with placebo, N-acetyl cysteine supplement was associated with a significant reduction in PANSS score in schizophrenia patients, but this association was not found in schizophrenia patients treated with folic acid or vitamin B12, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid and vitamin D.</p></li><li><p>The results from network meta-analysis indicated that N-acetyl cysteine supplement was significantly more efficacious than folic acid or vitamin B12 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in the term of PANSS score changes.</p></li><li><p>The estimated ranking probabilities of treatments showed that NAC might be the most effective intervention overall nutritional supplements.</p></li></ul><p>Nutritional supplementations have been widely used as adjunctive treatments for schizophrenia.

The orderly cascade of brain development may be disrupted by exposure to suboptimal concentrations of a range of biological substrates and micronutrients. We hypothesized that those exposed to vitamin D deficiency during early life have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. The hypothesis was based on the link between an increased risk of schizophrenia in (a) those born in winter and spring, when vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent, and (b) the offspring of dark-skinned migrants living in cold climates, who have a markedly increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>In this review, we summarize evidence from analytic epidemiology related to this hypothesis. Two case-control studies based on Danish neonatal dried blood spots have found that neonatal vitamin deficiency is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. However, recent genetic analyses have also suggested that common variants linked to schizophrenia may lead to lower vitamin D concentrations (possibly mediated via reduced outdoor activity). We summarize the limitations of the current evidence and outline suggestions that can guide future research. Based on currently available data, there is insufficient evidence to support public health recommendations related to this topic.</p><p>However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the provision of vitamin D supplementation to pregnant women and/or offspring in groups vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency may subsequently reduce the incidence of schizophrenia in the offspring.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/low-d-when-young-may-lead-to-schiz.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=the-relationship-between-symptom-severity-and-low-vitamin-d-levels-in-patients-with-schizophrenia--oct-2016>The Relationship between Symptom Severity and Low Vitamin D Levels in Patients with Schizophrenia.- Oct 2016</h4><p>PLoS One. 2016 Oct 27;11(10):e0165284. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165284.>doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0165284.</a> eCollection 2016.</p><p>Doğan Bulut S1, Bulut S2, Görkem Atalan D3, Berkol T4, Gürçay E5, Türker T6, Aydemir Ç7.</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/plos-schiz.jpg alt=image>

In our study, the similarity of vitamin D levels, despite large statistical differences between our schizophrenia patient group and controls in relation to smoking and obesity, supports the idea that sunlight is a very important factor.

The aim of our study was to analyze the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a 1-year cohort of adult inpatients with schizophreniform and autism spectrum syndromes in a naturalistic inpatient setting in Germany.</p><p>PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS:</p><p>Our study was comprised of 60 adult schizophreniform and 23 adult high-functioning autism spectrum patients who were hospitalized between January and December of 2015. We compared our findings with a historical German reference cohort of 3,917 adults using Pearson&rsquo;s two-sided chi-squared test. The laboratory measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2/3 <span>[25(OH)vitamin D]</span> were obtained using a chemiluminescence immunoassay.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>In the schizophreniform group, we found decreased (&lt;20 ng/ml) 25(OH)vitamin D levels in 48/60 (80.0%) of the patients.</p><p>In the autism spectrum group, decreased levels were detected in 18/23 (78.3%) of the patients.</p><p>25(OH)vitamin D deficiencies were found in 57.3% of the historical control group.</p><p>Particularly, severe deficiencies (&lt;10 ng/ml) occurred much more frequently in the schizophreniform (38.3%) and autism spectrum groups (52.2%),</p><p>when compared to the control group (16.3%).</p><p><strong>The recommended 25(OH)vitamin D values of >30 ng/ml were observed in only 5% of the schizophreniform patients, 8.7% of the autism spectrum patients, and 21.9% of the healthy controls.</strong></p><p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>We found very high rates of 25(OH)vitamin D deficiencies in both patient groups and have discussed whether our findings might be related to alterations in the immunological mechanisms. Irrespective of the possible pathophysiological links between vitamin D deficiency and schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorders, more frequent measurement of vitamin D levels seems to be justified in these patient groups. Further prospective, controlled, blinded, and randomized research should be conducted to analyze the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation on the improvement of psychiatric symptoms.</p><p>DOI: 10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00168 <strong>full free PDF online</strong></p><hr><h4 id=association-between-serum-levels-of-bioavailable-vitamin-d-and-negative-symptoms-in-first-episode-psychosis---sept-2016>Association between serum levels of bioavailable vitamin D and negative symptoms in first-episode psychosis - Sept 2016</h4><p>Psychiatry Res. 2016 Sep 30;243:390-4. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2016.07.003>doi: 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.07.003</a></p><p>Yee JY1, See YM2, Abdul Rashid NA2, Neelamekam S2, Lee J3.</p><p>1 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore. <a href=mailto:jie_yin_yee@imh.com.sg>jie_yin_yee@imh.com.sg</a>.</p><p>2 Research Division, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.</p><p>3Office of Clinical Sciences, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore; Department of General Psychiatry 1, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.</p><p>Total vitamin D levels had been commonly reported to be lowered in patients with chronic psychotic illnesses in countries from the higher latitudes.

In this study we investigated serum concentrations of total and bioavailable vitamin D levels in FEP patients compared to healthy controls and the association between symptom severity and vitamin D components. A total of 31 FEP patients and 31 healthy controls were recruited from Institute of Mental Health, Singapore. FEP patients were identified using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID-1) and severity symptoms were assessed using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Sera from participants were analyzed for total vitamin D, vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and bioavailable vitamin D. Linear regressions were performed to examine the associations between serum total and bioavailable vitamin D and the PANSS subscales. Current study noted a significantly lower bioavailable vitamin D was in the FEP group and an association between bioavailable vitamin D and negative symptoms in FEP patients in a population with a consistent supply of sun exposure throughout the year.</p><p>DOI: 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.07.003 <strong>Free PDF online</strong></p><hr><h4 id=low-vitamin-d-might-be-an-effect-rather-than-a-cause-of-schizophrenia---may-2016>Low Vitamin D might be an effect rather than a cause of schizophrenia - May 2016</h4><p><strong>Note: This study considers vitamin D blood levels, not cell levels (3 genes can block cell levels and not be seen by blood tests)</strong></p><p><strong>Investigating causality in the association between 25(OH)D and schizophrenia</strong></p><p>Sci Rep. 2016 May 24;6:26496. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep26496.>doi: 10.1038/srep26496.</a></p><p>Taylor AE1,2,3, Burgess S1,4, Ware JJ1,2,5, Gage SH1,2,3, Richards JB6,7,8, Davey Smith G1,5, Munafò MR1,2,3.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. However, it is not known whether this association is causal or what the direction of causality is. We performed two sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with serum 25(OH)D to investigate the causal effect of 25(OH)D on risk of schizophrenia, and SNPs robustly associated with schizophrenia to investigate the causal effect of schizophrenia on 25(OH)D. We used summary data from genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses of schizophrenia and 25(OH)D to obtain betas and standard errors for the SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations. These were combined using inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analyses. In 34,241 schizophrenia cases and 45,604 controls, there was no clear evidence for a causal effect of 25(OH)D on schizophrenia risk. The odds ratio for schizophrenia per 10% increase in 25(OH)D conferred by the four 25(OH)D increasing SNPs was 0.992 (95% CI: 0.969 to 1.015). In up to 16,125 individuals with measured serum 25(OH)D, there was no clear evidence that genetic risk for schizophrenia causally lowers serum 25(OH)D. These findings suggest that associations between schizophrenia and serum 25(OH)D may not be causal. <strong>Therefore, vitamin D supplementation may not prevent schizophrenia.</strong></p><p>PMID: 27215954 PMCID: PMC4877705 DOI: 10.1038/srep26496 <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/investigating-causality-in-the-association-between-25-oh-d-and-schizophrenia.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=97-of-schizophrenia-patients-were-vitamin-d-deficient-and-associated-small-brain-volumes---june-2015>97% of Schizophrenia patients were vitamin D deficient, and associated small brain volumes - June 2015</h4><p>Psychiatry Res. 2015 Jun 24. pii: S0925-4927(15)30013-5. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.06.006>doi: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.06.006</a></p><p>Serum vitamin D and hippocampal gray matter volume in schizophrenia.</p><p>Shivakumar V1, Kalmady SV2, Amaresha AC2, Jose D2, Narayanaswamy JC2, Agarwal SM2, Joseph B2, Venkatasubramanian G3, Ravi V4, Keshavan MS5, Gangadhar BN6.</p><p>Disparate lines of evidence including epidemiological and case-control studies have increasingly implicated vitamin D in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

Objective: We aimed to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis of observational studies to summarize the available data on the association between serum vitamin D levels and schizophrenia. Methods: A systematic research on all published articles until October 2013 was conducted in PubMed, ISI (Web of science), SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. All observational studies that had measured serum vitamin D levels in schizophrenic patients were included in the systematic review. After considering exclusion criteria, we had 19 studies for the systematic review that were included in three separate meta-analyses: 1) a meta-analysis on mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> (n = 13); 2) a meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (n = 8); 3) a meta-analysis on odds ratios (n = 8). Results: Findings from a meta-analysis on means revealed that the overall mean difference in serum 25(OH)D levels between schizophrenic patients and control participants was -5.91 ng/mL <span>[95% confidence interval (CI) -10.68, -1.14]</span>. Subgroup analyses based on study design, the patient&rsquo;s hospitalization status, study quality, and study location did not explain between-study heterogeneity; however, type of biomarker assessed <span>[25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 vs 25OH)D)]</span> could account for some degree of heterogeneity. Results from the meta-analysis on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency indicated that the overall prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in schizophrenic patients was 65.3% (95% CI 46.4%-84.2%).</p><p>Findings from the meta-analysis on odds ratios indicated that vitamin D-deficient persons were <strong>2.16 times</strong> (95% CI 1.32, 3.56) more likely to have schizophrenia than those with vitamin D sufficiency. No evidence of heterogeneity was detected. Conclusion: We found a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and schizophrenia.

Vitamin D is crucial not only for bone health but for proper brain development and functioning. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with depression, seasonal affective disorder, and schizophrenia in adults but little is known about vitamin D and mental health in the pediatric population.</p><p>METHODS: One hundred four adolescents presenting for acute mental health treatment over a 16-month period were assessed for vitamin D status and the relationship of 25-OH vitamin D levels to severity of illness, defined by presence of psychotic features.</p><p>RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D levels &lt;20 ng/ml) was present in 34%; vitamin D insufficiency (25-OH D levels 20-30 ng/ml) was present in 38%, with a remaining 28% in the normal range.</p><p>Adolescents with psychotic features had lower vitamin D levels (20.4 ng/ml vs. 24.7 ng/ml; p=0.04, 1 df).</p><p>The association for vitamin D deficiency and psychotic features was substantial (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4-8.9; p &lt;0.009).</p><p>Race was independently associated with vitamin D deficiency and independently associated with psychosis for those who were Asian or biracial vs. white (OR=3.8; 95% CI 1.113.4; p&lt;0.04). Race was no longer associated with psychosis when the results were adjusted for vitamin D levels.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are both highly prevalent in adolescents with severe mental illness. The preliminary associations between vitamin D deficiency and presence of psychotic features warrant further investigation as to whether vitamin D deficiency is a mediator of illness severity, result of illness severity, or both. Higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency but no greater risk of psychosis in African Americans, if confirmed, may have special implications for health disparity and treatment outcome research.</p><p><strong><a href=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/12/38/abstract%20>~~#00F:CLICK HERE</a> for PDF online~~</strong></p><hr><h4 id=association-between-first-episode-schizophrenia-and-low-vitamin-d---feb-2014-includes-pdf>Association between first-episode schizophrenia and low vitamin D - Feb 2014, includes PDF</h4><p><strong>Relationship of low vitamin D status with positive, negative and cognitive symptom domains in people with first-episode schizophrenia.</strong></p><p>Early Interv Psychiatry. 2014 Feb 24. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.12122.>doi: 10.1111/eip.12122.</a></p><p>Graham KA1, Keefe RS, Lieberman JA, Calikoglu AS, Lansing KM, Perkins DO.</p><p>AIM: Deficient vitamin D levels are very common among Americans of all ages and ethnicities, but little is known about its prevalence or associated problems among those with schizophrenia.</p><p>METHODS: Stored plasma from 20 recent onset schizophrenia subjects and 20 matched healthy comparison subjects were analysed for 25 OH vitamin D, and related to measures of symptom severity and neurocognition.</p><p>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mean 25 OH vitamin D between the schizophrenia and the healthy comparison subjects (28.2 standard deviations (SD) 12.6 ng mL-1 vs. 29.9 SD 14.3 ng mL-1 ), and about half the subjects in each group had insufficient levels (&lt;30 ng mL-1 ).
