**FACT:**  Taking more vitamin D usually provides more benefits

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this report grouped all of the studies together: 200 IU to 4,000 IU

 **FACT:**  [Vitamin D3 works better than Vitamin D2](/tags/vitamin-d3-works-better-than-vitamin-d2.html)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this report grouped all of the studies together

 **FACT:**  The body reacts differently to daily, monthly, and annual doses of vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this report grouped all of the studies together

 **FACT:**  Closely spaced pregnancies result in even lower vitamin D levels

 **FACT:**  [Twins require even more vitamin D](/tags/twins-require-even-more-vitamin-d.html)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this report grouped singles and multiples together

 **FACT:**  All pregnancies should have at least some vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this report discarded an RCT because it had 400 IU in the control arm

 **FACT:**  [Dark skinned women](/tags/dark-skinned-women.html) are at high risk of being vitamin D deficient, so need more vitamin D than whites

 **OBSERVATION:**  After ignoring the facts, this report was unable to notice a statistical significance of the benefit of vitamin D during pregnancy

# Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy.

Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Feb 15;2:CD008873.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is thought to be common among pregnant women. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has been suggested as an intervention to protect against adverse gestational outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To examine whether supplements with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to women during pregnancy can safely improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2011), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 October 2011), the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (28 October 2011) and also contacted relevant organisations (8 April 2011).

SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials with randomisation at either individual or cluster level, evaluating the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with other micronutrients for women during pregnancy.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria ii) extracted data from included studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were checked for accuracy.

MAIN RESULTS: The search strategy identified 34 potentially eligible references. We included six trials assessing a total of 1023 women, excluded eight studies, and 10 studies are still ongoing. Five trials involving 623 women compared the effects of vitamin D alone versus no supplementation/placebo and one trial with 400 women compared the effects of vitamin D and calcium versus no supplementation.Only one trial with 400 women reported on pre-eclampsia: women who received 1200 IU vitamin D along with 375 mg of elemental calcium per day were as likely to develop pre-eclampsia as women who received no supplementation (average risk ratio (RR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 1.35). Data from four trials involving 414 women consistently show that women who received vitamin D supplements had higher concentrations of vitamin D in serum at term than those women who received no intervention or a placebo; however the magnitude of the response was highly heterogenous. 

Data from three trials involving 463 women suggest that women who receive vitamin D supplements during pregnancy less frequently had a baby with a birthweight below 2500 grams than those women receiving no treatment or placebo;  **statistical significance**  was borderline (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.01). 

In terms of other conditions, there were  **no significant differences**  in adverse side effects including 

* nephritic syndrome (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; one trial, 135 women); 

* stillbirths (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; one trial, 135 women) or 

* neonatal deaths (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; one trial, 135 women) 

between women who received vitamin D supplements in comparison with women who received no treatment or placebo. 

No studies reported on preterm birth, maternal death, admission to neonatal intensive care unit/special nursery or Apgar scores.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation in a single or continued dose during pregnancy increases serum vitamin D concentrations as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D at term. The clinical significance of this finding and the potential use of this intervention as a part of routine antenatal care are yet to be determined as the number of high quality trials and outcomes reported is too limited to draw conclusions on its usefulness and safety. Further rigorous randomised trials are required to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy.
