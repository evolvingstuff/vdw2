&lt;p>Vitamin D is a known modulator of inflammation. Native dietary vitamin D3 is thought to be bio-inactive, and beneficial vitamin D3 effects are thought to be largely mediated by the metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3.

&lt;p>Some recent studies have proposed an important role for vitamin D in reducing the risk of infection by assisting in the suppression of viruses and by controlling the inflammatory response. A low vitamin D state may have a detrimental effect on the immune system&amp;rsquo;s ability to produce activated CD8+ T cells, and it may increase the inflammatory reaction to Epstein Barr virus. The aim of this chart review was to see if serum 25 OH vitamin D3 levels in service members with acute pharyngitis were lower in those who had positive rather than negative monospot tests. A retrospective chart review was conducted on the medical records of service members who presented to sick call at Camp Lejeune, NC with acute pharyngitis from October 8, 2010 until June 30, 2011. Serum 25 OH vitamin D3 levels were compared between those with positive and negative monospot test results. Of the 25 records that were reviewed, there were 9 (36%) service members with positive results, and they were found to have lower vitamin D levels (Median = 20.80 ng/ml, Interquartile range = 10.15) than those with negative test results (Median = 30.35 ng/ml, Interquartile range = 17.05), Mann-Whitney U = 41, p = .039. Only 1 of the 9 with positive test results had a normal serum 25 OH vitamin D3 level (30 ng/ml or greater) compared with 9 of the 16 with negative test results. Optimal vitamin D stores may play a significant role in reducing the risk of developing acute mononucleosis but larger, prospective studies will be needed to verify these findings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Metadichol (Policosanol) supplement appears to improve health in many ways - multiple studies</title><link>/posts/metadichol-policosanol-supplement-appears-to-improve-health-in-many-ways-multiple-studies.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/metadichol-policosanol-supplement-appears-to-improve-health-in-many-ways-multiple-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#00F;">Is avaiable in capsules and nanoemulsion spray&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Vitamin D plays key roles in bone, infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases. As most people get inadequate sun exposure for sufficient vitamin D status, they need adequate intake of dietary vitamin D. Many studies see optimizing vitamin D status as a public health priority. It is thus vital to gain deeper insight into vitamin D intestinal absorption. It was long assumed that vitamin D intestinal absorption is a &lt;strong>passive process&lt;/strong> , but new data from our laboratory showed that it is actually far more complex than previously thought.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When to take Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/when-to-take-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/when-to-take-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Take vitamin D before/during largest meal of the day&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Because the current interferon (IFN)-based treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has a therapeutic limitation and side effects, a more efficient therapeutic strategy is desired. Recent studies show that supplementation of vitamin D significantly improves sustained viral response via IFN-based therapy. However, mechanisms and an active molecular form of vitamin D for its anti-HCV effects have not been fully clarified. To address these questions, we infected HuH-7 cells with cell culture-generated HCV in the presence or absence of vitamin D(3) or its metabolites.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is the Iranian Revolution to Blame for the Increasing Incidence of Multiple Sclerosis in Iran</title><link>/posts/is-the-iranian-revolution-to-blame-for-the-increasing-incidence-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-iran.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/is-the-iranian-revolution-to-blame-for-the-increasing-incidence-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-iran.html</guid><description>&lt;p>There are two items on this page&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological disorder most likely caused by gene–environment interactions. There is a latitudinal gradient of MS prevalence and vitamin D deficiency has been strongly implicated in MS aetiology. Iran is a country of high levels of sunshine which has previously been considered a low–risk MS region. However, Iran has recently observed an &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#F00;">8.3–fold rise in the incidence of MS between 1989–2006&lt;/span>.&lt;/strong> 1 Previous studies have indicated a genetic predisposition to MS in the Iranian population but genetic changes are unlikely to account for the substantial rise in MS over the last few decades. Thus, we aimed to develop a novel hypothesis to explain the identification of Iran as a high–risk MS region. We believe that the influence of decreased sunshine exposure and vitamin D levels on MS risk needs to be strongly considered in the context of Iran&amp;rsquo;s history. In 1979 the Iranian Revolution took place and a country previously under great Western influences became an Islamic republic. It became a government requirement for women to wear loose–fitting clothing and the veil in public; it has previously been shown that veiled women have lower vitamin D levels compared to unveiled women. This significant cultural shift would not only potentially explain the observed increase in MS but notably, it would account for the increasing female preponderance of MS in Iran. Given that the average age of MS onset is 30 years old and that MS incidence in Iran just over 30 years following the revolution is the highest so far recorded, an association with the Iranian revolution and reduced subsequent vitamin D levels in particularly pregnant women is likely. Lifestyle changes such as urbanization and use of sunscreen may to some extent have contributed to increased vitamin D deficiency, but these are unlikely to contribute to the particularly high increase in MS observed in Iran as these changes occurred across the developed world and there is no evidence to suggest that they were particularly great in Iran. &lt;strong>A similar high incidence of MS has been observed among Iranian immigrants in countries at high latitude such as Sweden&lt;/strong> where Iranian immigrants have a reported greater prevalence of MS compared to the general population, &lt;strong>despite wearing a veil not being a requirement.&lt;/strong> Instead it is well–known that UVB exposure is lower in countries at high latitude and thus, a similar effect of increased MS incidence due to vitamin D deficiency may be observed among those in Iran wearing the veil and those resident in countries at high latitude, even if they are not wearing the veil. Therefore, vitamin D repletion is a critical public health issue for Iranians both within and outside Iran, and could help prevent an emerging MS epidemic in this population. More generally, this region is highly interesting for MS research and highlights that regions of exception to the latitudinal gradient of MS prevalence are an under–appreciated and very useful resource in evaluating MS aetiology.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Just mark your calendar for vitamin D days</title><link>/posts/just-mark-your-calendar-for-vitamin-d-days.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/just-mark-your-calendar-for-vitamin-d-days.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Could be once a week, once every few days, or even once every two weeks.&lt;/p>
