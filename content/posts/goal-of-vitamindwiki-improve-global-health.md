### Moving toward the goal of improving global health in 2015

 **1) Use social media to inform the public about Vitamin D:** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; Our 5 minute video: [Does Less Sun Mean More Disease?](/posts/does-less-sun-mean-more-disease)

 **2) Directly advertise to individuals the benefits of Vitamin D**  

&nbsp; &nbsp;- via Google AdWords - which is free for non-profits

&nbsp; &nbsp; search keywords ==> advertisement ==> 70+ specific VitaminDWiki pages

 **3) Encourage [Health Maintenance Organizations](/posts/hmos-will-save-millions-of-dollars-with-vitamin-d) (HMOs) to PROFIT from vitamin D supplementation** 

(We expect that when 1+ HMOs embrace Vitamin D that momentum will be created for HMOs, hospitals, employers, etc)

Pregnancy should provide a large and quick Return on Investment

Profit by reducing % of [preterm births](/posts/vitamin-d-webinar-cost-of-pre-term-birth-etc-baggerly)

&nbsp; &nbsp; Each preterm birth costs an HMO an additional $33,000

&nbsp; &nbsp;10% of births are normally preterm, but only 5% are preterm if high vitamin D

&nbsp; &nbsp;One fewer preterm birth if give 20 women vitamin D: (total cost = $3,000?)

&nbsp; &nbsp;HMO savings= $30,000  (Return On Investment = 10X )

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **$1 million savings**  resulting from fewer preterm births in 330 pregnancies

Additional profit (to be computed) from reduction in [C-section](/posts/caesarean-birth-much-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-many-studies)

Extremely low risk experment for an HMO. 

 **4) Support Vitamin D for pregnancy: by advertising, etc.** 

Project by [GrassrootsHealth](http://www.grassrootshealth.net/): 500 women in South Carolina.

Extend by VitaminDWiki to some of the other 99.9999% of pregnant women

In addition to the HMO benefits mentioned above, will add benefits to:

 **Mother:**    Decreased labor pains, depression, tooth loss, bacteria vaginosis, . . .

 **Child:**  Decreased asthma, colds, flu, ear infection, . . 

Recommend augmenting prenatal vitamins with vitamin D - once every two week: capsule or powder on food

Recommend continuing with same vitamin D dose after birth.
