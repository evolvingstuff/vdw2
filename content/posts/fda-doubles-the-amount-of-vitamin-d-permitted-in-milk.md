#### [FDA Update](http://www.fda.gov/food/newsevents/constituentupdates/ucm510556.htm)

 **Manufacturers are now Permitted (not required) to 2X the amount of Vitamin D** 

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Category of food  | Maximum levels in food <br>(as served) |
| Breakfast cereals  | 350 IU/100 grams  |
| Grain products and pasta  | 90 IU/100 grams |
| Milk  | 42 IU/100 grams<br> 84 IU as of July 2016 |
| Milk products  | 89 IU/100 grams |

* “ . .  **allow**  manufacturers to voluntarily add up to 84 IU/100g of vitamin D3 to milk, 

> 84 IU/100g of vitamin D2 to plant-based beverages intended as milk alternatives, and 

> 89 IU/100g of vitamin D2 to plant-based yogurt alternatives.”

#### Notes by VitaminDWiki

 **Since many people now drink low fat or non-fat milk (which provide litte vitamin D to the body) this FDA change will not make much difference** 

 **&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps increase the population level of vitamin D by 2 nanograms** 

 **&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anticipate 5+ nanograms in next few years due to increased supplementation and sunshine** 

 **[FDA decided to double vitamin D in milk after talking 4 times with by Dr. Matthews – July 2016](/posts/fda-decided-to-double-vitamin-d-in-milk-after-talking-4-times-with-by-dr-matthews)** 

1. Manufacturers are allowed to add up to 84 IU/100 grams

> Since there are 3924 grams/gallon

> ~3300 IU/gallon (200 IU/cup)

1. As a non-manufacturer, you may add as much vitamin D3 as you want.

> 10,000 IU, 20,000 IU, 30,000 IU? – per gallon

> Recommend a water-soluable form of Vitamin D3 so that you get the benefits

> even if the fluid does not contain fat (low fat milk, plant mil, fturi juices, etc)
