Vitamin D before, during, and after pregnancy&nbsp; &nbsp;=alternate name

The more vitamin D for mom, the more benefits for both of them

* The benefits to mom start about 2,000 IU daily average (2000 IU costs less than $15 per year)

* Substantial benefits proven for 4,000 IU taken during pregnancy (fewer complications, lower cost)

* Best benefits at 6,000 IU - this much is also needed if breast feeding without supplementing the infant

* Taking > 2,000 IU raises the cost, primarily due to cost of [Cofactors](/posts/low-cost-cofactors-for-vitamin-d).

#### Summary of Pregnancy page by Chat-GPT as of Feb 28, 2025

Vitamin D plays a critical role in pregnancy and fetal development. The VitaminDWiki page provides a comprehensive overview of how adequate vitamin D before, during, and after pregnancy benefits both mother and child. It compiles research findings, dosage recommendations, and outcomes related to vitamin D status in pregnancy. Overall, higher vitamin D intake is associated with better pregnancy outcomes (fewer complications) and improved infant health, while vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women is widespread and linked to various risks.

 **Optimal Vitamin D Intake During Pregnancy** 

A higher daily vitamin D dose is recommended for expecting mothers than standard prenatal guidelines typically suggest. Key recommendations from the page include:

*  **2,000 IU/day**  – Considered a baseline intake that begins to provide benefits for the mother. This amount is very affordable (estimated at under $15 per year).

*  **4,000 IU/day**  – Demonstrated in studies to yield substantial benefits during pregnancy, including fewer complications for the mother. This dose has been proven safe and more effective than lower doses in improving outcomes.

*  **6,000 IU/day**  – Identified as an optimal level for maximizing health benefits for both mother and baby. Importantly, ~6,000 IU daily is needed for breastfeeding mothers to ensure their breast milk contains enough vitamin D for the infant (if the baby isn’t receiving vitamin D drops separately).

These suggested intake levels greatly exceed many current official recommendations but are supported by research on pregnancy outcomes. The page notes that taking above ~2,000 IU/day may slightly increase costs (mainly due to adding  **cofactors** —other nutrients that support vitamin D’s effects). It advises that women using higher doses ensure they get those cofactors (e.g. magnesium, vitamin K₂, etc.) and not too much calcium (keep supplemental calcium < 750 mg/day) for optimal balance. It’s also suggested to test vitamin D blood levels in high-risk pregnant women about 6 weeks after starting supplementation to confirm they’ve reached adequate levels.

 **Health Benefits for Mothers** 

Adequate vitamin D during pregnancy has been linked to a wide range of maternal health benefits. The page highlights research showing that mothers with higher vitamin D levels or supplementation have:

*  **Reduced risk of pregnancy complications:**  Higher vitamin D is associated with significantly lower rates of  **preeclampsia**  (high blood pressure in pregnancy) and  **gestational diabetes** . For example, women taking around 4,000 IU daily had far lower odds of developing preeclampsia, and vitamin D supplementation has been shown to cut gestational diabetes incidence by roughly 30–60% in multiple studies. Sufficient vitamin D also correlates with fewer infections during pregnancy (such as bacterial vaginosis) and better immune function.

*  **Lower chance of cesarean section:**  Vitamin D sufficiency appears to reduce the likelihood of needing a C-section. One summary on the page noted that women with higher vitamin D had about 4 times fewer unplanned Cesarean deliveries compared to those with low levels.

*  **Improved fertility and lower miscarriage risk:**  The overview cites evidence that adequate vitamin D helps with conception and maintaining pregnancy. Women with good vitamin D status were less likely to experience infertility issues or early miscarriages (one observational finding was a 2.5-fold reduction in miscarriage rates with higher vitamin D).

*  **Better maternal health and wellness:**  Sufficient vitamin D supports the mother’s overall health. It contributes to stronger bones for the mother (preventing the loss of bone density during pregnancy), and even dental health appears better – one study listed found women taking ~2,000 IU had half the dental problems during pregnancy. Some evidence suggests vitamin D may improve sleep quality in the second trimester and reduce the risk of postpartum depression. In one trial, women given vitamin D had about a 40% lower rate of postnatal depression.

 **Health Benefits for Infants and Children** 

Getting enough vitamin D during pregnancy doesn’t just benefit the mother – it has lasting impacts on the baby’s health as well. The VitaminDWiki page outlines numerous benefits for infants and children when the mother’s vitamin D status is high:

*  **Higher birth weight and full-term births:**  Mothers with ample vitamin D are less likely to have preterm or low-birth-weight babies. Studies in the review showed that sufficient vitamin D intake (e.g. 2,000 IU in a trial in India) led to fewer premature births, higher newborn weights, and even better APGAR scores at birth. Conversely, low maternal vitamin D was linked to a higher chance of preterm labor. (One cited study found that having vitamin D < 20 ng/mL made preterm delivery about 3 times more likely, and another noted a 7-fold higher risk of low-birth-weight babies when the mother was very deficient.) Ensuring adequate vitamin D through pregnancy appears to support carrying to term and delivering a healthier-weight infant.

*  **Lower risk of childhood illnesses:**  Maternal vitamin D sufficiency has been associated with reduced risks of various childhood conditions. For example, taking around 4,400 IU/day during pregnancy was found to cut the risk of  **asthma or wheezing in the child**  by about 50%. Adequate prenatal vitamin D also resulted in fewer childhood  **respiratory infections and ear infections** , as vitamin D supports the developing immune system. There is evidence that children born to vitamin D–replete mothers have a lower chance of developing allergies (one trial showed a 5-fold reduction in dust-mite allergy in kids when moms supplemented). Additionally, infants whose mothers had high vitamin D had a much lower incidence of  **infantile rickets**  and better bone development.

*  **Neurodevelopment and long-term outcomes:**  The vitamin D status of the mother can influence the child’s brain development and long-term health. Research summarized on the page found that children of mothers with higher vitamin D scored better on tests of language and motor skill development in early childhood. For instance, one study noted 2× fewer language delays by age 5 when moms took adequate vitamin D. There are also indications that sufficient prenatal vitamin D might reduce the risk of  **autism**  in the child (especially in families with a history) – one intervention reported a 4-fold reduction in autism in subsequent siblings when high-dose vitamin D was given to pregnant mothers and infants. Moreover, an intriguing association is noted between maternal vitamin D and the child’s risk for  **multiple sclerosis**  or other autoimmune diseases decades later. Ensuring the mother has healthy vitamin D levels during pregnancy could impart long-term protective effects for the offspring.

 **Scientific Studies and Evidence** 

The webpage backs up these benefits with a large collection of scientific studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and meta-analyses. In total, dozens of studies are referenced, and their findings converge on the conclusion that vitamin D is crucial for a healthy pregnancy. Some notable research highlights include:

*  **Safe and effective high-dose trials:**  Multiple RCTs led by vitamin D researchers (such as Dr. Bruce Hollis and Dr. Carol Wagner) have tested daily doses like 4,000 IU and even higher, finding significant benefits with no safety issues. A landmark trial showed that 4,000 IU/day for pregnant women was safe and more effective than 400 IU or 2,000 IU in achieving sufficient blood levels and improving outcomes. Follow-up studies and others in different populations (including a 2023 Mongolian RCT) have consistently reported that ~4,000 IU daily optimizes maternal and neonatal vitamin D status and reduces complications. A 2020 study demonstrated that 6,400 IU/day postpartum (for breastfeeding mothers) safely raised both mom and baby’s vitamin D. These high-dose regimens have not shown adverse effects and are increasingly considered both safe and necessary to reach target vitamin D levels (usually around 40–50 ng/mL) for health.

*  **Reduced preterm birth and complications:**  An important 2017 trial (GrassrootsHealth cohort analysis) found that raising pregnant women’s vitamin D levels was associated with dramatically lower preterm birth rates – up to 50-70% reduction in preterm births for women who achieved around 40 ng/mL vs those around 20 ng/mL. Similarly, a 2018 randomized trial reported a 7-fold drop in preeclampsia rates in the high-dose vitamin D group (~4,000 IU/day) compared to controls. Many other intervention studies summarized on the page echo these findings: vitamin D supplementation tends to lower the incidence of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and infections. Even recurrence of preeclampsia in high-risk women was cut in half in a trial using 50,000 IU every two weeks. In contrast, trials using low doses (like 800 IU/day or 1,000 IU/day) often showed minimal improvement, underlining that dose matters – effective results often require several thousand IU daily.

*  **Infant and childhood health trials:**  Research extending to infants after birth supports maternal vitamin D supplementation benefits. For example, one RCT (published in 2016) gave pregnant women 5,000 IU/day and their newborns 1,000 IU/day, and observed a fourfold reduction in autism in later offspring of families at risk. Other trials indicated that infants whose mothers took high vitamin D or who were given vitamin D supplements themselves had stronger immunity (fewer wheezing illnesses) and needed fewer antibiotics in their first year. On the other hand, infants who received only the standard 400 IU had relatively modest increases in blood levels, whereas higher doses led to optimal vitamin D status (one study showed infants needed around 1,600 IU daily to achieve healthy levels).

*  **Meta-analyses and reviews:**  The page references systematic reviews that compile data from many studies. A 2012 meta-analysis cited found that low maternal vitamin D was significantly associated with various problems, including a 60% higher risk of having a low-birth-weight baby. Reviews in 2013 concluded that about 4,000 IU daily is an optimal and safe dose in pregnancy, and highlighted that many groups of pregnant women (such as those with darker skin, living in northern latitudes, or with limited sun exposure) are at particularly high risk for deficiency. The consensus emerging from the scientific literature is that current standard prenatal vitamin D recommendations (often just 400–600 IU) are far too low to achieve the blood levels needed for these health benefits.

The breadth of studies compiled on the page shows consistent trends:  **Vitamin D sufficiency leads to healthier pregnancies and babies.**  Many of the positive findings (fewer preterm births, less asthma in children, etc.) were observed specifically when mothers attained serum 25(OH)D levels around 40–50 ng/mL, which typically requires supplementation in the thousands of IU. In contrast, vitamin D inadequacy is common and associated with poorer outcomes.

 **Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnancy** 

One of the striking points made is how widespread vitamin D deficiency is among pregnant women worldwide, even in sunny regions. Several studies are mentioned that illustrate this problem:

* In a study of pregnant women in South Carolina (32°N latitude, a sun-rich environment), 48% of women were outright deficient (<20 ng/mL) and an additional 37% had insufficient levels (<32 ng/mL) at their first prenatal visit. African American women had the lowest levels – in that study, 94% of Black mothers had insufficient vitamin D. This highlights that lifestyle, skin pigmentation, and other factors can lead to deficiency even where sunlight is abundant.

* In the United States, overall vitamin D status in women of childbearing age is poor. CDC data (from around 2010) showed roughly 1 in 3 American women have levels below 20 ng/mL. The prevalence is even higher in certain groups: among women with less than a high school education it was ~55%, and among Black women it was about 78% who were below 20 ng/mL. This deficiency epidemic contributes to racial and socio-economic disparities in pregnancy outcomes (for example, the page notes the higher preterm birth rate in U.S. Black women – about 17% vs 11% in white women – which could be partly linked to lower vitamin D).

* Deficiency is extremely common in regions with less sun or cultural practices of covering skin. Cited figures include 80% of South Asian women in the UK having vitamin D levels under 10 ng/mL in winter, and around 90% of pregnant women in India (and their newborn infants) under 20 ng/mL. In some developing countries, severe deficiencies (<5 ng/mL) are seen in children. Such low levels contribute to health problems like rickets in infants and osteomalacia in mothers.

* The page also mentions that in 62 out of 65 countries analyzed, preterm birth rates have been rising, and it implies vitamin D deficiency may be a contributing factor. For instance, one note suggests that in very hot climates with high UV (like parts of the US South or Middle East), people stay indoors (often in air conditioning) to avoid the heat, but this also means they avoid sun exposure and can become deficient despite the sunlight available. This could paradoxically lead to higher rates of preterm birth in those high-UV regions due to low vitamin D.

These findings collectively raise concern that current nutritional guidelines are not preventing deficiency in pregnant women. The page essentially argues that improving vitamin D status on a population level could reduce many of these adverse outcomes and should be a public health priority.

 **Vitamin D Supplementation for Infants** 

Another aspect the webpage covers is vitamin D in infants – both how much infants need and how maternal vitamin D impacts the baby after birth. Key points include:

*  **Standard infant recommendations:**  In the US, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 400 IU/day of vitamin D for infants (particularly breastfed infants, since breast milk normally contains little vitamin D unless the mother supplements heavily). Many infants, however, do not even receive this amount. The page notes fewer than 40% of infants actually get the advised 400 IU. In fact, a 2010 study found many children did not even get 200 IU per day from all sources, and essentially no children in that cohort exceeded 480 IU/day intake. This indicates poor adherence and possibly the need for alternative strategies to ensure infants get enough vitamin D.

*  **Higher needs for infants:**  Emerging research suggests 400 IU might be too low for optimal infant health. A 2013 JAMA randomized trial found that infants may require around  **1,600 IU daily**  to achieve vitamin D blood levels in the desired range. Other countries sometimes recommend more than 400 IU; for example, Poland has recommended about 100 IU of vitamin D per kilogram of body weight for infants (so a 5 kg baby would get 500 IU). France’s pediatric society even suggested that breastfed infants receive 1,000–1,200 IU/day. These higher infant doses have been used and were well-tolerated, resulting in better vitamin D status (some German infants given 250 IU/day reached robust levels around 56 ng/mL, and those given 500 IU/day reached ~60 ng/mL without issues). Importantly, one long-term Finnish study showed that infants supplemented with 2,000 IU/day not only grew to normal height but also had a dramatically lower incidence of type 1 diabetes as they got older, with no adverse effects – highlighting potential lifelong benefits of higher vitamin D in infancy.

*  **Maternal vs infant supplementation:**  There are two ways to ensure an infant gets enough vitamin D – either give the infant drops directly or have the breastfeeding mother take a high enough dose that her milk is enriched with vitamin D. Research supports the latter approach: if a lactating mother takes about  **6,000 IU/day** , her breast milk will contain ample vitamin D to meet the baby’s needs (equivalent to the baby getting 400–800 IU or more just from nursing). This was demonstrated in an RCT where 6,400 IU to mothers was as effective as giving 300 IU to the baby directly. This approach can be easier for families (avoiding the need for infant drops) but it relies on the mother’s compliance with a higher dose. The page does caution against certain practices like extremely infrequent large dosing for infants; one study tried giving infants 50,000 IU every two months (which averages ~833 IU/day) and noted that such a long interval between doses is not ideal for maintaining steady levels. Regular daily dosing (for infant or mother) is preferable.

*  **Preventing rickets and bone issues:**  Ensuring infants get enough vitamin D is critical to prevent rickets, a disease of bone weakening. The category “Rickets/Battered Child/Weak bones” is mentioned, pointing out that infants with severe vitamin D deficiency can present with bone fractures that mimic signs of child abuse. In fact, some cases of suspected abuse have turned out to be undiagnosed rickets. Proper vitamin D supplementation of infants (or high-dose supplementation of the mother while breastfeeding) can prevent rickets entirely. Historically, some countries provided very high doses to infants to curb rickets – the page notes Finland once recommended a dose about 20× higher than the current US standard (likely an older practice of a few thousand IU daily) to ensure babies had enough. While that level is no longer used, it underlines the safety margin of vitamin D in infants when monitored, and that the pendulum has perhaps swung too far to low dosing in recent decades.

 **Global Guidelines and Calls to Action** 

The overview also touches on how different health organizations and countries handle vitamin D in pregnancy, often highlighting a mismatch between research findings and official recommendations:

* In the UK, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as of 2012 was still recommending only 400 IU/day for pregnant women – a level the page calls “amazingly low” given the evidence for higher doses. Many experts consider such low dosing insufficient to prevent deficiency.

* France takes a different approach: the French Pediatric Society’s guideline (2012) for pregnant women was to give a single oral dose of 80,000–100,000 IU vitamin D at the beginning of the 7th month of pregnancy. This is essentially a one-time high-dose “loading” strategy. VitaminDWiki’s commentary on this is that giving that much all at once is “too much all at once” – implying a preference for spreading the dose – but it illustrates that some national guidelines do acknowledge the need for higher total vitamin D intake during pregnancy (just delivered in a bolus form).

* Researchers like Dr. Michael Holick have called for action to increase vitamin D intake in pregnancy. A 2019 “call to action” cited on the page advocates for allowing loading doses and generally raising target levels for pregnant women, given the clear benefits and safety profile. Similarly, multiple conferences and publications (including a 2013 workshop and a 2015 GrassrootsHealth analysis) have pushed for recognizing vitamin D as a key factor in reducing preterm births and other poor outcomes.

* The compilation on VitaminDWiki also includes many “overview” papers by experts. For example, summaries of work by Hollis and Wagner from 2010–2013 consistently conclude that  **4,000 IU/day is the optimal dose**  in pregnancy for safety and efficacy. They emphasize starting vitamin D early (even before conception, if possible) to ensure the mother enters pregnancy with a healthy vitamin D status. In fact, one section is titled  **“Ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby – take Vitamin D before conception”** , underscoring that women trying to become pregnant (and even fathers, for sperm quality) might benefit from raising their vitamin D levels pre-pregnancy to improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes.

There is also mention of a  **“Vitamin D Intervention clinical trials – 75 as of July 2017”**  which indicates the rapidly growing scientific attention: by 2017 there were at least 75 clinical trials investigating vitamin D in pregnancy. This number has likely grown, reflecting global interest in resolving optimal dosing and confirming all the benefits. The overall direction of these efforts is to incorporate the research findings into standard care – increasing recommended vitamin D supplementation for pregnant women and infants to improve health outcomes.

 **In conclusion** , the VitaminDWiki overview of pregnancy and vitamin D presents compelling evidence that maintaining high vitamin D status is essential for maternal health, successful pregnancy, and the child’s development. Key takeaways are that  **most pregnant women are not getting enough vitamin D under current guidelines, and this deficiency is linked to higher risks of complications and suboptimal infant health** . By contrast,  **supplementation with adequate doses (on the order of thousands of IU per day) dramatically improves outcomes**  – reducing preterm births, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, infections, and ensuring infants develop strong bones and healthy immune systems. The page’s summary of dozens of studies makes a strong case for revising public health recommendations to encourage higher vitamin D intake before, during, and after pregnancy for the benefit of both mothers and their children.

* "However, it’s important not to exceed the recommended daily intake during pregnancy, as higher doses of certain vitamins and minerals may be harmful to the fetus (e.g., iron, folic acid, zinc)"

* "These may encompass vitamins vitamin B1, vitamin B2, B3, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, C, D, E, and K, along with folic acid, iodine, magnesium, iron, copper, zinc, selenium, and sometimes additional components like omega-3."

#### Placenta

 **[The Placenta, an Afterthought No Longer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/health/placenta-pregnancy-health.html) New York Times Dec 2018** 

* "An ephemeral organ, long dismissed merely as afterbirth, increasingly is viewed as critical to understanding the health and course of pregnancy."

* "Ninety percent of the placenta is made up of cells not from the mother but from the fetus."

* "As the placental beachhead grows, its cells specialize to do the work of heart, lungs, liver and kidneys until the fetus can fend for itself. Groups of cells exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide; provide nutrients and hormones; protect the fetus from harmful stress, germs and chemicals; and remove waste"

* "Male fetuses typically are larger than females throughout gestation, but they also have higher rates of spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, premature birth and neurodevelopmental conditions."
