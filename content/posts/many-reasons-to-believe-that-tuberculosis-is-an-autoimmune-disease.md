Tuberculosis remains a common and dangerous chronic bacterial infection worldwide. It is long-established that pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases is mainly promoted by inadequate immune responses to bacterial agents, among them Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a multifaceted process having many different outcomes and complications. Autoimmunity is one of the processes characteristic of tuberculosis; the presence of autoantibodies was documented by a large amount of evidence. The role of autoantibodies in pathogenesis of tuberculosis is not quite clear and widely disputed. They are regarded as: 

* (1) a result of imbalanced immune response being reactive in nature, 

* (2) a critical part of TB pathogenicity, 

* (3) a beginning of autoimmune disease, 

* (4) a protective mechanism helping to eliminate microbes and infected cells, and 

* (5) playing dual role, pathogenic and protective. 

There is no single autoimmunity-mechanism development in tuberculosis; different pathways may be suggested. It may be excessive cell death and insufficient clearance of dead cells, impaired autophagy, enhanced activation of macrophages and dendritic cells, environmental influences such as vitamin D insufficiency, and genetic polymorphism, both of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and host.
