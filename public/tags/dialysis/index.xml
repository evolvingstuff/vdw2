Background Hypovitaminosis D is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D replenishment in CKD are not well described.

Methods An 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel intervention study was conducted in haemodialysis (HD) and non-HD CKD patients. Treatment consisted of 40 000 IU of cholecalciferol orally per week. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-diOHD), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum phosphate, ionized serum calcium and serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) were analysed. We also investigated biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease (plasma D-dimer, plasma fibrinogen, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, plasma interleukin 6, plasma C-reactive protein, blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, aortic pulse wave velocity and 24-h urinary protein loss). Objective and subjective health variables were assessed (muscle function tests, visual analogue scores and Health Assessment Questionnaire).

Results Fifty-two CKD patients with 25-OHD &amp;lt;50 nmol/L at screening were included. Cholecalciferol supplementation led to a significant increase to a median of 155 nmol/L 25-OHD (interquartile range 137–173 nmol/L) in treated patients (n = 25, P &amp;lt; 0.001). 

In non-HD patients, we saw a significant increase in 1,25-diOHD (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and a lowering of PTH (n = 13, P &amp;lt; 0.001). 

This was not observed in HD patients. Cholecalciferol supplementation caused a significant increase in serum calcium and FGF-23.

Conclusions 25-OHD replenishment was effectively obtained with the employed cholecalciferol dosing. In non-HD patients, it had favourable effects on 1,25-diOHD and PTH. Vitamin D-supplemented patients must be monitored for hypercalcaemia. 

The present study could not identify significant pleiotropic effects of 25-OHD replenishment.

!!Summary by author for VitaminDWiki
*40,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for just 8 weeks to 25 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease and hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D levels below 20 nanograms/mL) , placebo to 24 matched controls 
*Active treatment corrected hypovitaminosis in all patients with final average vitamin D levels of 62 nanograms/mL versus 9 nanograms/mL in the placebo group. 
+Note: Vitamin D levels would probably have been much higher if the trial had lasted longer 
+Vitamin D half-life is 4-8 weeks.
*Beneficial effects on bone metabolism were seen in the subgroup of patients who were NOT undergoing dialysis, but not in patients undergoing dialysis

│ full_match: `. We investigated the relationship between serum calcifediol levels and vertebral fractures (VF), vascular calcifications (VC) and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Within a multicenter, cross-sectional study in 18 hospital based dialysis centers in Italy, we included 387 hemodialysis patients (143 F, 37% ; 244 M, 63%), mean age 64±14 (SD) years, median dialytic age 49 months, BMI 25± 4 Kg/m2. We determined total 25(OH)D using the LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D kit (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater MN, USA). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis of scanned L-L vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of &amp;gt; 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). Fracture severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20–25%, 25–40% or &amp;gt;40%, respectively). VC assessments were also centralized. Witteman’s method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe &amp;gt;10 cm). We also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe &amp;gt;5cm).

!!!ASSOCIATION OF CALCIFEDIOL LEVELS WITH VERTEBRAL FRACTURES, VASCULAR CALCIFICATIONS AND MORTALITY.

The best biomarker of Vitamin D status is calcifediol [25(OH)D]. We investigated the relationship between serum calcifediol levels and vertebral fractures (VF), vascular calcifications (VC) and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Within a multicenter, cross-sectional study in 18 hospital based dialysis centers in Italy, we included 387 hemodialysis patients (143 F, 37% ; 244 M, 63%), mean age 64±14 (SD) years, median dialytic age 49 months, BMI 25± 4 Kg/m2. We determined total 25(OH)D using the LIASON® 25 OH Vitamin D kit (DiaSorin Inc., Stillwater MN, USA). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis of scanned L-L vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of &amp;gt; 20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). Fracture severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20–25%, 25–40% or &amp;gt;40%, respectively). VC assessments were also centralized. Witteman’s method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe &amp;gt;10 cm). We also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe &amp;gt;5cm). Any differences in VC were resolved by consensus. Follow up was 2.7±0.5 years. 

Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L and median PTH 244 pg/ml. We found a median 25(OH)D level of 28.9 ng/ml. Nine ( 2.3%) patients had vitamin D deficiency (&amp;lt;10 ng/ml), 198 (51.2%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency (between 10-29.9 ng/ml) and 180 (46.5%) patients had normal levels ( &amp;gt;30 ng/ml). We found that 55% of patients had VF and 30.9% of patients had BF. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and 55,1% in the iliac arteries. Males had more VF than Females (60% versus 48%, P=0.019).

No associations were found between VF and biochemical parameters including calcifediol levels (p=0.662), 
while we found an association between low calcifediol levels and a higher prevalence of severe aortic calcifications (36.8 vs 28.2, p=0.0044). 

Furthermore, we found a __OR 1.85__ (1.04-3.29 CI, p=0.0367) for Aortic Calcification in patients with calcifediol levels lower than the median value of 29 ng/ml. 

During follow-up (2.7±0.5 years) mortality was of 19.9%. 

No association was found between mortality and calcifediol levels (p=0.5394). 

In conclusion, despite good control of bone and mineral metabolism parameters, hemodialysis patients showed high prevalence of VF and VC. Our study suggests that high calcifediol levels could be protective against progression of severe aortic calcification
