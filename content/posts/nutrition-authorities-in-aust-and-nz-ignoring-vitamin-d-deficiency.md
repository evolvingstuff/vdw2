## [Nutrition authorities ignoring vitamin D deficiency](http://scepticalnutritionist.com.au/?p=272)

blog post by Sceptical Nutritionist

 **A few highlights** 

* Professor Caryl Nowson stated that Australia has one of the most restrictive food regulations in the world with respect to the amount of vitamin D permitted in the food supply.

* average estimated dietary intake for adults is only 2–3 μg/day

* When I read the draft Australian Dietary Guidelines I expected to find at least a brief review of Australia’s vitamin D deficiency problem, recommendations on how it could be addressed in the context of the current food supply and prospects for future action. 

* But don’t bother looking – there wasn’t a single literature review conducted on vitamin D and any aspect of health
