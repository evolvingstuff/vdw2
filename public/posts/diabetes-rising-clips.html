Fast forward to the 21st century and the number is as high as 24. Each year, scientists estimate that the number of deaths among children due to type 1, or juvenile, diabetes increases by three percent with no signs of slowing down.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes, the kind most often associated with obesity and excessive sugar consumption, is often referenced in media reports and medical journals as increasing at a dangerously high rate, but type 1 is rarely addressed despite the fact that it is rising at a similar rate.</p><p><strong>Dan Hurley</strong> , an investigative journalist who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1975, is compiling a report on his findings about the disease, noting that it is much more prevalent than people have been led to believe. Evidence is showing that, despite the widespread belief that type 1 diabetes is rare and develops from a genetic predisposition, juvenile diabetes is probably being triggered by environmental or lifestyle factors in a similar manner as type 2.</p><p>In his book, Hurley outlines five potential causes of the disease and its rapid increase. These include a lack of natural sunlight exposure, the destruction of natural skin pathogens that create immunity, exposure to cow’s milk at a young age, persistent exposure to pollutants and carcinogens, and the accelerated production of insulin-producing beta cells due to overall growth in height and weight averages among children.</p><p>Hurley believes that a comprehensive, national tracking system of type 1 diabetes cases will help researchers to determine the causes of the disease.</p><p><strong>Comments by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger</strong> Someday western medicine will catch up to the truth that the natural health community already knows: That drinking pasteurized, processed cow&rsquo;s milk can promote autoimmune disorders such as type-1 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency, meanwhile, is an epidemic in our western world, and if you take a vitamin D deficient population and pump all the people full of vaccines and dairy products, it shouldn&rsquo;t be a big surprise to start seeing a huge rise in autoimmune disorders like type-1 diabetes. But conventional medicine, as usual, remains entirely clueless about the real causes of type-1 diabetes (or even cancer or diabetes, for that matter). And because the medical system refuses to acknowledge the fact that environmental influences (chemicals, dietary choices, etc.) can cause these conditions, it is unable to offer any solutions for patients. So patients are simply put on a lifetime regimen of dangerous pharmaceutical chemicals instead of being taught real solutions for avoiding autoimmune disorders altogether.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just another day in the U.S. sick-care system, it seems…</p><p><strong>Author’s web site</strong> <a href=http://hstrial-dhurley.homestead.com/>==http://hstrial-dhurley.homestead.com/==</a> <span>[mailto:hurleydan@aol.com]</span></p><h1 id=incidence-of-type-1-diabetes-doubles-in-20-years-continues-rising-at-3-percent-per-year----but-why>Incidence of type 1 diabetes doubles in 20 years, continues rising at 3 percent per year &ndash; but why?</h1><p>Eureka Alert Contact: Jessica Jonap <span>[mailto:Jessica@JonapPR.com]</span> 305-864-5521 Kaplan Publishing</p><p>Book investigates leading scientific hypotheses to explain mysterious increase</p><p>NEW YORK&ndash;The incidence of type 1 diabetes is now twice as high among children as it was in the 1980s, and 10 to 20 times more common than 100 years ago, according to peer-reviewed research uncovered in a new book from Kaplan Publishing.</p><p>While rising levels of type 2 diabetes are well known (and typically linked to increasing obesity), the corresponding rise in type 1, or &ldquo;juvenile,&rdquo; diabetes has rarely if ever been described in the news media, despite a substantial body of scientific evidence. While widely accepted by leading diabetes researchers, the increase in type 1 has as yet received scant attention from leading diabetes advocacy organizations.</p><p>Now veteran medical journalist Dan Hurley has gathered the evidence from published studies and investigative reporting in DIABETES RISING: How A Rare Disease Became A Modern Pandemic, And What To Do About It. Hurley, an award-winning reporter who has written often for the &ldquo;Science Times&rdquo; section of The New York Times, cites studies and analysis by some of the top researchers in the field documenting the long-term and ongoing rise.</p><p>Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1975, when he was an 18-year-old college freshman, Hurley knew nobody else at the time with the disease, which was then remarkably rare. &ldquo;Now I know three other people with the disease who live in my own neighborhood,&rdquo; Hurley says. &ldquo;As both a person with type 1 diabetes and a reporter who has specialized in medical journalism for more than 20 years, I was shocked to learn in the course of researching this book that type 1 appears to be rising just as fast as type 2. I think the media has given so little coverage to the rise of type 1 because it simply doesn&rsquo;t fit with the conventional wisdom that it&rsquo;s supposed to be a super-rare disease caused by a genetic predisposition. Obviously, genes haven&rsquo;t changed, so something in our environment or lifestyle has.&rdquo;</p><p>Seeking to explain the mysterious rise in type 1, the book examines five leading scientific hypotheses that offer an explanation:</p><ul><li><p>The &ldquo;accelerator hypothesis,&rdquo; which asserts that the rising weight and height of children over the past century has &ldquo;accelerated&rdquo; their tendency to develop type 1 by putting the insulin-producing beta cells in their pancreases under stress.</p></li><li><p>The"sunshine hypothesis," which holds that the increased time spent indoors is reducing children&rsquo;s exposure to sunlight, which in turn reduces their level of vitamin D (the &ldquo;sunshine vitamin&rdquo;). Reduced levels of vitamin D, and reduced exposure to sunshine, have each been linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;hygiene hypothesis,&rdquo; which holds that lack of exposure to once-prevalent pathogens results in autoimmune hypersensitivity, leading to destruction of the body&rsquo;s insulin-producing beta cells by rogue white blood cells.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;cow&rsquo;s milk hypothesis,&rdquo; which holds that exposure to cow&rsquo;s milk in infant formula during the first six months of life wreaks havoc on the immune system and increases the risk to later develop type 1.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;POP hypothesis,&rdquo; which holds that exposure to persistent organic pollutants increases the risk of both types of diabetes. "</p></li></ul><p>The book cites recent studies which show that back in 1890, the reported annual death rate from diabetes for children under the age of 15 was 1.3 per 100,000 children in the United States. &ldquo;Because any death due to diabetes in those days had to be caused by what we now call type 1, researchers consider the 1.3 per 100,000 figure to be a rough estimate of the yearly incidence of new cases at that time,&rdquo; Hurley writes. &ldquo;In Denmark, the rate was fairly similar, about 2 per 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. From that baseline, things took off. By the mid-1980s, the yearly incidence of new cases of type 1 had jumped to 14.8 per 100,000 children in Colorado. By the opening years of the 21st century, the incidence rate in six geographic areas of the United States, as measured in a new study run by the CDC, had climbed to 23.6 per 100,000 among non-Hispanic white children. The rates were 68 percent higher than those reported in Colorado in the 1980s, and more than twice as high as reported in Philadelphia in the 1990s.&rdquo;</p><p>The book quotes Dr. Pina Imperatore, chief epidemiologist in the diabetes division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as noting that it&rsquo;s important to recognize that reported rates in the past are subject to uncertainties. But, she said, &ldquo;It seems the trend we&rsquo;re seeing in the United States today is similar to what has been reported in Europe and worldwide, about a 3 percent increase annually in the incidence of type 1.&rdquo;</p><p>While the CDC is now tracking the incidence of type 1 diabetes in six communities around the country, no national study is tracking rates as they occur elsewhere, Hurley notes. He cites a 2007 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association which called for &ldquo;a coordinated approach for childhood diabetes surveillance (i.e. mandated case-reporting). Only then can society respond effectively to the serious and increasing challenge of diabetes in youth.&rdquo;</p><p>The book cites numerous peer-reviewed studies and editorials, including:</p><ul><li><p>Edwin A.M.

Medical journalist Dan Hurley explores why a once rare disease is exploding around the world, and why doctors focus so much on treatment, rather than cures or prevention.</p><p>You know, it seems we&rsquo;ve set up a world that is perfect for creating diabetes in so many ways. It&rsquo;s not just the food. It&rsquo;s the lack of time we spend outside in sunshine, Vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin. It increases your protection against developing diabetes. Persistent organic pollutants that are everywhere, they&rsquo;re ubiquitous in the culture, they&rsquo;ve been found to have a 37-fold increase - that&rsquo;s 37 times likelier - to develop Type 2 diabetes. So the world we&rsquo;ve living in is a diabetes machine.</p><h3 id=npr-selected-comments>NPR selected comments</h3><p>Doctors have really struggled for years how to distinguish between the two types, basically, and they finally gave up and just came up with these blank-sounding terms, Type 1 and Type 2.</p><p>Type 1 usually occurs when you&rsquo;re young. I got it when I was 18. Usually the oldest a person would get it would be into their 20s. A lot of kids will develop it, if they get it. And you need insulin. Basically your immune system has attacked the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas, kills them. You&rsquo;ve got no insulin. You will die if you don&rsquo;t get insulin, and there&rsquo;s no diet that will save you except, you know, you do want to follow a healthy diet.</p><p>Type 2 is slower-forming. It&rsquo;s usually in later life. It&rsquo;s usually associated with being overweight, but as I&rsquo;ve said, it&rsquo;s happening much more often in younger kids. It&rsquo;s being seen in the teens and the 20s, even in people that are not necessarily very overweight, and although everyone likes to seem to think that you could diet your way out of Type 2, it is, it is really tough to do that.</p><p>Caller after the NPR show was concerned that HFCS was brushed aside</p><p>My disagreement comes with his idea that technology is &ldquo;the cure.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m less sure. I have a machine attached to me 24/7 that measures my glucose every 5 minutes. It is called a CGMS. I also have another one attached 24/7 that continuously injects insulin. It is called an insulin pump. According to the story, data from the first can be used and communicated to the second to &ldquo;act&rdquo; like a normal pancreas. Not so. There is a 30 minute lag between what the blood glucose is and what the CGMS &lsquo;reads.&rsquo; There is another 20-30 minute lag between what insulin is injected into the body until it takes effect. Together that is an hour. My glucose can jump up to 200 points in that time.</p><p>I hate to see this fight between T1&rsquo;s and T2&rsquo;s, but I think the reason some T1&rsquo;s feel the need to comment that T2&rsquo;s caused their own disease are a few: one, because SO much more attention is given to T2 because it is so common, and we kind of want to be like, &ldquo;Hey, pay attention to us, those people who got a more serious disease completely at random!&rdquo;; two, because T2 IS often preventable and curable.</p><p>Now, I ALWAYS say that T2 is MORE dffcult because I know, as a T1, that any and all insulin I&rsquo;ve got in me I gave to myself. Also, T1 relies a lot less on dieting. I mean, yes, it&rsquo;s helpful to eat low fat since fat takes FOREVER to absorb and just makes your blood sugar go high repeatedly until it&rsquo;s all done, but really, us T1&rsquo;s can eat what we want as long as we give ourselves insulin for it. But T2&rsquo;s make some insulin, take crazy pills I don&rsquo;t understand, have to diet, exercise. So, certainly, I&rsquo;m not trying to minimize it.</p><p>It sure was refreshing to hear this on Talk of the Nation today. Type 1 so rarely gets discussed. Plus, to hear someone mention the dangers of low blood sugar (which I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of close calls with) and explain that this is a problem that HEALTHY diabetics have was so very validating!</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Why has the rate of Type I increased by 5 times in 65 years? I&rsquo;m not up to date, but last I knew, it was conceptualized as an autoimmune disorder. Has that changed? Did it used to be that more babies were lost prenatally, or for other reasons, such as malnutrition, and so not counted as diabetic? Why should an autoimmune disorder increase so dramatically? If there are actually more cases, it can&rsquo;t be just genetics. Is it a virus? Does this have any implications for Type II, which wasn&rsquo;t conceptualized as simply, primarily autoimmune? Are there any other autoimmune disorders with such dramatic changes in incidence?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>I too, am a type 1 diabetic. I was diagnosed at age 13 and have subsequently become a clinical pharmacist due to the vast amount of knowledge it takes to control this disease and also to help others who struggle with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, I was only able to listen to a small piece of this program but I was very disturbed by the way type 1 diabetes could be misunderstood by listeners who may generally think of diabetes in terms of type 2 diabetes. These are in fact, very different diseases that happen to result in the same symptom of high blood sugar.</p><p><strong>There are 4 types of diabetes:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Type 1: is an autoimmune disorder in which the body&rsquo;s immune system attacks and destroys insulin producing cells so that the body cannot produce insulin.</p></li><li><p>Type 2: Is a problem of insulin resistance. Cellular receptors mutate and cannot recognize the insulin being made, in response to this the body makes more and more insulin to overcome the resistance and eventually the insulin producing cells &ldquo;give out.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Gestational diabetes: Is a form of insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy</p></li><li><p>Diabetes insipidus: Is not associated with insulin or blood sugar regulation and occurs due to hormonal imbalances that affect fluid regulation.</p></li></ol><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Comment in a Natural News item by <strong>TedHutchinson</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>The University conducting this research is at latitude 40S but for several reasons the sun shines brighter, there is more UVB present in the Southern hemisphere than at the equivalent latitude in the Northern hemisphere so in practice 40S it is equivalent to latitude 32N. The point is that if at that latitude South Asian women taking 4000iu/daily/D3 fail to get 25(OH)D above 80 to 119 nmol/L (32ng/ml~ 48ng/ml) then we will have to use MORE vitamin D3 daily to achieve the 55ng/ml<del>70ng/ml that will provide a more adequate reserve of stored vitamin D3 to deal with inflammation. Human skin NATURALLY creates 10,000</del>20,000iu D3 given a relatively short, full body, midday, non burning, prone, sun exposure. Levels around 1000iu/daily/D3 for each 25lbs you weigh should be regarded as the basis for supplementing with D3. There is plenty of research showing amounts up to 10,000iu/daily are absolutely safe even in area&rsquo;s where effective, sunshine is available throughout the year. Regular postal 25(OH)D testing is relatively cheap and easily available from &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href=http://www.grassrootshealth.net/daction%22&amp;gt;Grassrootshealth>http://www.grassrootshealth.net/daction"&amp;gt;Grassrootshealth</a> D action&lt;/a> What is so frustrating about this issue is that we know that using 2000iu/daily Vitamin D3 in the first year of life prevented 80% of Type One Diabetes Incidence.
