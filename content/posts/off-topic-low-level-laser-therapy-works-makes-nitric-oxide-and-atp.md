I designed and built an [LLLT system for my Wife's Lymphodemia](http://www.henrylahore.com/Health/LLLT.html)

It worked extremely well

Found it also works on [Knee Osteoarthritis](/posts/i-needed-more-than-vitamin-d-to-treat-my-knee-osteoarthritis) and many other health problems

Helped me with reducing the pain of [Wisdom Tooth removal](/posts/wisdom-tooth-3rd-molar-extraction-helped-by-vitamin-d-loading-dose-rct)

It puts out less than 1/100 of the wattage needed to be able to sense a temperature difference.

But, it is definitely sensed by cells which need an energy boost - slight burning sensation 10-30 minutes later

Soon after the discovery of lasers in the 1960s it was realized that laser therapy had the potential to improve wound healing and reduce pain, inflammation and swelling. In recent years the field sometimes known as photobiomodulation has broadened to include light-emitting diodes and other light sources, and the range of wavelengths used now includes many in the red and near infrared. The term “low level laser therapy” or LLLT has become widely recognized and implies the existence of the biphasic dose response or the Arndt-Schulz curve. This review will cover the mechanisms of action of LLLT at a cellular and at a tissular level and will summarize the various light sources and principles of dosimetry that are employed in clinical practice. The range of diseases, injuries, and conditions that can be benefited by LLLT will be summarized with an emphasis on those that have reported randomized controlled clinical trials. Serious life-threatening diseases such as stroke, heart attack, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury may soon be amenable to LLLT therapy.

 **[45 LLLT (Low-Level Laser Therapy) & Photobiomodulation Benefits + Devices](https://selfhacked.com/blog/my-review-of-lllt/) Self-Hacked** 

 **The following is just the Table of Contents, online has hyperlinks to details, how to use, etc.** 

1. In general, lowering inflammation where ever applied (R, R2). Specifically, by reducing levels of PGE(2), Cox 2, IL-1b, TNF, neutrophil cell influx and oxidative stress (R)

1. Wound healing/Tissue growth and repair (R)

1. Depression (R)

1. Anxiety (R)

1. Pain relief in various syndromes (R, R2, R3)

1. Arthritis (R, R2)

1. Back pain (R), neck pain (R)

1. Autoimmune conditions like thyroiditis (R) and others

1. Traumatic brain injuries (R), strokes (R) and other brain injuries (R)

1. Tooth repair (R, R2), pain from orthodontics (R)

1. Hair growth and male pattern baldness (R) – different wavelength and power are required.

1. Smoking Cessation (R)

1. Laryngitis/Hoarseness (R) Laryngitis can be hoarseness, globus, chronic cough, voice fatigue, throat pain, and dysphagia. 

1. Some migraines and headaches (R) – may make them worse too if you have vasodilatory headaches.

1. Weight loss? (R) – probably with infrared sauna (have not used).

1. Peptic ulcers (R), Venous Leg Ulcers (R), Pressure ulcers (R), Oral Mucositis (R) Aphthous stomatitis (R)

1. Edema (R, R2)

1. Lung inflammation (R), COPD (R)

1. Alcohol addiction (R)

1. Narcolepsy based on theory (R).  Narcolepsy is likely an autoimmune disorder (R)

1. Oral Lichen Planus (R)

1. Cancer: Various tumors, when used with a photosensitizer (R)

1. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes (R, R2/R2) “It should be well noted that the common thought, that it is impossible for the pancreas to restore its function and morphology in case of diabetes mellitus, has definitely come to an end in the history of this disease and mankind…….Secondly, it has been ascertained from this study that the quantum energy of laser rays is capable of  **stimulating and causing the regeneration of pancreatic tissues** , including the B-cells of the Islets of Langerhans, even in advanced disease states.”  I can’t find these studies in any journal, but it’s quite intriguing.  Skepticism is always advised, although I don’t see the harm in trying it on the pancreas.

1. Based on the mechanism’s involved I’d expect it to help for cognitive-based disorders like Autism, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar disorders.  Autism, for example, is in part a result of mitochondrial dysfunction (R) and inflammation (R).  Deficiencies in the cells’ ability to fuel brain neurons might lead to some of the cognitive impairments associated with autism and higher levels of free radicals also might contribute to autism severity (R).  Mitochondrial abnormalities also occur in bipolar and schizophrenia (R), as well as inflammation (R, R)

1. It should also help with inflammatory gut problems like Crohn’s and Colitis.

#### LLLT generated Nitric Oxide in 1 minute - RCT 2013

 **Low-level laser treatment with near-infrared light increases venous nitric oxide levels acutely: a single-blind, randomized clinical trial of efficacy** 

Randomized Controlled Trial Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 2013 Feb;92(2):151-6. [doi: 10.1097/PHM.0b013e318269d70a.RCT](https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0b013e318269d70a.RCT)

Objective: The use of near-infrared light in the form of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has become more popular in the treatment of a variety of conditions where increased peripheral blood flow is desired. The hypothesis behind its working mechanism is its purported ability to generate nitric oxide (NO) in the treated area. We tested the hypothesis that the efficacy of near-infrared light lies in its ability to generate NO at the treatment site.

Design: We conducted a single-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to measure NO, by its metabolites nitrite and nitrate, in venous blood draining from tissue receiving LLLT. Fifteen healthy subjects received LLLT to the forearm, and blood samples were taken immediately before treatment; at 1, 5, 15, and 30 mins; as well as 15 mins after the treatment to check for NO content.

Results: We found a significant treatment effect (F = 15.75, P = 0.003). A post hoc test showed that minutes 1, 5, and 15 were different compared with the baseline measures (P's < 0.05). The area under the treatment curve was significantly larger than the area under the sham treatment curve (t = 2.26, P = 0.037). A limitation of this study was that the data were collected from healthy subjects.

Conclusions: LLLT increased NO levels in venous blood draining from the treatment site in healthy subjects. The peak increase in NO occurred 5 mins into the treatment, after which it slowly waned. Further research is necessary to assess NO increases with LLLT in patients with pathologie
