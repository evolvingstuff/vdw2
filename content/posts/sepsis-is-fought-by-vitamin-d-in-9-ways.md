Vitamin D is an important immune modulator that is linked to infection susceptibility. It has been suggested that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in sepsis and septic shock because vitamin-D-related pathways are associated with various immunological, endocrine, and endothelial functions. Previous research has yielded inconclusive results regarding the link between mortality and vitamin D deficiency in sepsis patients. In patients with sepsis and severe vitamin D deficiency, an adequate vitamin D concentration may reduce mortality. Randomized controlled trials to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes in sepsis patients with vitamin D deficiency are uncommon. We will provide an overview of the current knowledge about the relationship between vitamin D and sepsis in this review, as well as consider the potential value of vitamin D supplementation in this situation.
