#### Sickness absence and disability pension days in patients with cluster headache and matched references

Christina Sjöstrand, MD, PhD, Kristina Alexanderson, PhD, Pontus Josefsson, MSc, and Anna Steinberg, MD, PhD

Neurology May 26, 2020 94 (21) e2213-e2221 https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000009016

To determine whether patients with cluster headache have more sickness absence and disability pension days compared to matched references and possible associations with sociodemographic characteristics.

Methods

We performed a registry study of all patients who had received specialized health care for cluster headache (ICD-10 code G44.0) aged 16–64 years and living in Sweden in 2010 (n = 3,240; 34% women) and matched references from the total population (n = 16,200) regarding their sickness absence and disability pension days in 2010.

Results

Mean number of sickness absence days in 2010 was  **16.13**  (95% confidence interval, 14.05–18.20) among patients with cluster headache and  **6.54**  (5.97–7.11) among references. When combining sickness absence and disability pension days, patients with cluster headache had 63.15 (58.84–67.45) days, references 34.08 (32.59–35.57) days. Among patients, women had twice as many sickness absence days than men: 23.71 (19.36–28.06) vs 12.41 (10.19–14.63). 

When adding disability pension days, those numbers were  **83.71**  (75.57–91.84) vs  **52.56**  (47.62–57.51). Patients with cluster headache had significantly more sickness absence days in all ages compared to the reference group. Patients with elementary education had more sickness absence/disability pension days (85.88 <span>[75.34–96.42]</span>) compared to those with high school (64.89 <span>[58.82–70.97]</span>) and college/university (41.42 <span>[34.70–48.15]</span>) education.

Conclusion

This nationwide study shows that patients with cluster headache have significantly more sickness absence and disability pension days compared to matched references. Furthermore, among patients, women had more sickness absence and disability pension days than men.

!!!!Sickness absence and disability pension days in patients with cluster headache and matched references
Christina Sjöstrand, MD, PhD, Kristina Alexanderson, PhD, Pontus Josefsson, MSc, and Anna Steinberg, MD, PhD
Neurology May 26, 2020 94 (21) e2213-e2221 https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000009016

To determine whether patients with cluster headache have more sickness absence and disability pension days compared to matched references and possible associations with sociodemographic characteristics.

Methods
We performed a registry study of all patients who had received specialized health care for cluster headache (ICD-10 code G44.0) aged 16–64 years and living in Sweden in 2010 (n = 3,240; 34% women) and matched references from the total population (n = 16,200) regarding their sickness absence and disability pension days in 2010.

Results
Mean number of sickness absence days in 2010 was __16.13__ (95% confidence interval, 14.05–18.20) among patients with cluster headache and __6.54__ (5.97–7.11) among references. When combining sickness absence and disability pension days, patients with cluster headache had 63.15 (58.84–67.45) days, references 34.08 (32.59–35.57) days. Among patients, women had twice as many sickness absence days than men: 23.71 (19.36–28.06) vs 12.41 (10.19–14.63). 
When adding disability pension days, those numbers were __83.71__ (75.57–91.84) vs __52.56__ (47.62–57.51). Patients with cluster headache had significantly more sickness absence days in all ages compared to the reference group. Patients with elementary education had more sickness absence/disability pension days (85.88 [75.34–96.42]) compared to those with high school (64.89 [58.82–70.97]) and college/university (41.42 [34.70–48.15]) education.

Conclusion
This nationwide study shows that patients with cluster headache have significantly more sickness absence and disability pension days compared to matched references. Furthermore, among patients, women had more sickness absence and disability pension days than men.

**&quot;Even in remission, nine times as many episodic patients rated their health as poor/very poor compared to controls (9% vs 1%, p = 0.002). For chronic patients, __the odds of rating health as good/very good were ten times lower compared to controls__ (OR:10.10, 95%CI:5.29–18.79. p &lt; 0.001) and three times lower compared to episodic patients in remission (OR:3.22, 95%CI:1.90–5.47, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, chronic cluster headache patients were 5 times more likely to receive disability pension compared to episodic (OR:5.0, 95%CI:2.3–10.9, p &lt; 0.001). The mean direct annual costs amounted to 9,158€ and 2,763€ for chronic and episodic patients, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). &quot;
