35 Objective: It has been suggested that vitamin D may play a role in the pathogenesis of several

36 endocrine diseases such as hyperparathyroidism, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune

37 thyroid diseases, Addison's disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome. In this review, we debate

38 the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of endocrine diseases.

39 Methods: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the current evidence retrieved

40 from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts.

41 Results: Evidence from basic science supports a role for vitamin D in many endocrine

42 conditions. In humans, inverse relationships have been reported between not only blood 25

43    hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations but also with risk of type 1

44 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. There is less evidence for an

45 association with Addison's disease or autoimmune thyroid disease. Vitamin D

46 supplementation may have a role for prevention of type 2 diabetes, but the available evidence

47 is not consistent.

48 Conclusions: Although observational studies support a potential role of vitamin D in

49 endocrine disease, high quality evidence from clinical trials does not exist to establish a place

50 for vitamin D supplementation in optimizing endocrine health. Ongoing randomized

51 controlled trials are expected to provide insight into the efficacy and safety of vitamin D in

52 the management of endocrine disease.

### Introduction

64

65 The main physiologic role of vitamin D is to regulate calcium and phosphorus homeostasis

66 and to promote bone health. However, accumulating evidence from animal and human studies

67 suggests that vitamin D may also be important for a variety of non-skeletal actions that may

68 be important in the pathogenesis of several endocrine diseases. The increased appreciation of

69 the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D and the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in the

70 general healthy population has generated very high interest in vitamin D among researchers,

71 clinicians and the lay public. Vitamin D has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several

72 endocrine conditions, including primary hyperparathyroidism, type 1 diabetes (1), type 2

73 diabetes (2,3), autoimmune thyroid (4) adrenal diseases (5) and polycystic ovary syndrome

74 (PCOS). The present review focuses on the reported association between vitamin D status and

75 endocrine diseases and the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of

76 endocrine diseaser

### Vitamin D homeostasis

78

79 Humans derive vitamin D from cutaneous synthesis (in the form of cholecalciferol <span>[D3]</span>), from

80 diet (in the form of D3) and from nutritional supplements in the form of D3 or ergocalciferol

81 <span>[D2]</span> (6).6 Upon exposure to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB), 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin is

82 converted to pre-vitamin D3, which is immediately converted to vitamin D3 in a heat-

83 dependent process.  After ingestion or synthesis, vitamin D is hydroxylated in the liver to

84 form 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D2 or 25 (OH)D3), its major circulating form, which has

85 little biological activity.  25(OH)D is converted in the kidney by 25(OH)D-1alpha-

86 hydroxylase (CYP27B1), to its bioactive hormonal metabolite 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D

87 (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D or calcitriol). The primary action of 1,25(OH)2D is through the nuclear vitamin

88 D receptor, which heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and binds to vitamin D

89 responsive elements near target genes (6,7). The primary action of 1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D is to enhance

90 intestinal calcium absorption and to promote osteoclast function, thereby maintaining calcium

91 and phosphorus homeostasis and bone health. However, the discovery that nearly all tissues in

92 the body express the vitamin D receptor and that several tissues also express CYP27B1,

93 thereby allowing for local production of 1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D with a paracrine effect, has provided

94 important insights into the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D and its potential role in a variety of

95 extra-skeletal tissues (7), including many that affect endocrine disease.

96

### Classification of vitamin D status and vitamin D intake requirements

98

99 Blood concentration of 25OHD is the biomarker used by clinicians and researchers to

100 determine vitamin D status. However, there is no consensus on the 25OHD thresholds for

101 defining vitamin D adequacy. The guidelines by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the

102 Endocrine Society differ on classification of vitamin D status (8,9). These differences are 

103 explained by the populations targeted by the guidelines and how the evidence was

104 synthesized. Specifically, the IOM guidelines concentrated on the general healthy population

105 and considered only trials and concluded that blood concentration of 25OHD > 20 ng/mL is

106 consistent with favourable skeletal outcomes. In contrast, the Endocrine Society clinical

107 practice guidelines concentrated on people at high risk for vitamin D deficiency and

108 considered both trials and observational (epidemiologic) studies in concluding that blood

109 concentration of 25OHD > 30 ng/mL is desirable for optimal skeletal outcomes without any

110 upper limit that would be concerning for safety. Both guidelines agreed that recommendations

111 will require reconsideration in the future as additional data from on-going randomized trials

112 become available. Variability in vitamin D-binding protein and bioavailable 25OHD

113 concentration may also be important when assessing vitamin D status, especially in certain

114 populations, such as African-Americans. (10)

115

116 The recommended intakes by the two guidelines also differ. The IOM report on dietary

117 reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D recommends 600 international units per day of

118 vitamin D for individuals 9-70 years and 800 international units for those older than 70 years

119 as the recommended dietary allowance (RDA), which is defined as the intake that meets the

120 needs of 97.5% of the healthy population. In contrast, the Endocrine Society clinical practice

121 guidelines conclude that to raise the blood level of 25OHD consistently above 30 ng/mL,

122 intakes of 1500 to 2000 IU/day are required. The IOM report recognized the lack of trials

123 with vitamin D supplementation for non-skeletal outcomes as a major hurdle in establishing

124 recommendations,   while  the  Endocrine   Society   guidelines   applied  evidence from

125 observational studies to develop its recommendations and considered blood 25OHD

126 concentration as a clinically important surrogate outcome that correlates with health and

127 disease. 128

### Vitamin D and Primary Hyperparathyroidism

130

131 Ionized calcium is the most tightly regulated analyte in the circulation. This fine regulation is

132 achieved through an interplay between parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin and

133 1,25(OH)2D.   Parathyroid hormone is the major stimulator of renal CYP27B1, which

134 increases biosynthesis of 1,25(OH)2D. In turn, PTH is down-regulated both by 1,25(OH)2D

135 and ionized calcium.

136

137 The seemingly inactive vitamin D metabolite, 25(OH)D, is an important regulator within

138 parathyroid tissue. Parathyroid cells take up vitamin D binding protein along with its

139 25(OH)D, which is the mechanism that provides parathyroid tissue with better access to

140 circulating 25(OH)D than most other tissues. Furthermore, the parathyroid glands possess the

141 enzyme, CYP27B1, which produces 1,25(OH)2D for local paracrine regulation. The

142 combined effect of efficient access to circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D plus the local

143 production of 1,25(OH)2D is suppression of both PTH secretion and parathyroid cell

144 proliferation (11). 145

146 Larger parathyroid adenomas respond poorly to feedback by calcium or 1,25(OH)2D;

147 consequently, in primary hyperparathyroidism, 1,25(OH)2D levels often correlate positively

148 with   circulating   25(OH)D   (12).      If  vitamin  D   supply   is   low,   then primary

149 hyperparathyroidism    can    remain    latent,    known    as    "normocalcemic primary

150 hyperparathyroidism" (13).    Hypercalcemia develops once the 25(OH)D concentration

151 increases and elevated PTH stimulates renal CYP27B1 relentlessly, which generates

152 1,25(OH)2D in proportion to the supply of 25(OH)D.    This relationship highlights a

153 fundamental aspect of the vitamin D system: its operation under first-order reaction kinetics,

154 namely, the yield of the product (1,25<span>[OH]</span>2D) is proportional to the supply of the substrate

155 (25<span>[OH]</span>D). Therefore, the enzymes of the vitamin D system need to modify their function

156 according to the supply of 25(OH)D. Depending on severity, primary hyperparathyroidism

157 can disrupt the adaptation, resulting in elevated 1,25(OH)2D and increased intestinal calcium

158 absorption.   While this form of hypercalcemia, promoted by the underlying parathyroid

159 adenoma, is not strictly a manifestation of vitamin D toxicity, it is a form of hypersensitivity

160 to higher doses of vitamin D that is important to consider, given how common parathyroid

161 adenomas are (14). 162

163 In healthy persons, the reference (normal) range for serum PTH is known to decline as serum

164 25(OH)D levels increase. Therefore, the theoretical plateau in PTH, as 25(OH)D increases,

165 can be used as a determinant in establishing adequacy of vitamin D status. That relationship

166 breaks down in primary hyperparathyroidism, because with disease progression, PTH

167 becomes an unregulated driver of 25(OH)D metabolism into 1,25(OH)2D, a powerful

168 hypercalcemic hormone. Ongoing research (table 1) will further clarify the effect of vitamin

169 D supplementation on hyperparathyroidism.

170

### Vitamin D and type 1 diabetes (T1DM)

172

173 Type 1 diabetes is one of the first endocrine disorders where a potential role for vitamin D

174 was reported. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by an autoimmune destruction of the insulin

175 producing pancreatic islet beta-cells, rendering patients dependent on insulin administration

176 for survival (15). Potential effects of vitamin D deficiency on T1DM are multiple, including

177 alterations in the innate immune system, such as impaired macrophage function, but also

178 dysfunction of the beta-cell itself (16). Caution, however, is warranted when postulating a

179 direct effect of vitamin D deficiency on immune or beta-cell function in vivo, as vitamin D

180 deficiency leads to decreased calcium concentration, with calcium being a crucial ion both for

181 immune function and insulin secretion. In non obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the principal

182 animal model of T1DM, severe vitamin D deficiency increases the risk for developing

183 diabetes (17), but absence of any effect on T1DM presentation in vitamin D receptor

184 knockout NOD mice suggests a redundancy of the vitamin D system in the pathogenesis of

185 T1DM (18). In vitro, the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D, directly protects beta-cells

186 from the destructive effects of inflammatory cytokines and limits the inflammatory profile of

187 macrophages (19,20).

188

189 In NOD mice, administration of high doses of 1,25(OH)2D from early life onwards lowers

190 incidence of T1DM (21, 22), highlighting vitamin D as a promising intervention in preventing

191 T1DM. To replicate the immune and metabolic effects of the active form of vitamin D seen in

192 the mouse model, very high doses are required that would induce hypercalcemia and

193 hypercalciuria and potentially bone decalcification (23). Synthetic analogues of 1,25(OH)2D

194 with immune modulatory function but lesser effects on calcium and bone have been

195 developed to overcome such an obstacle. In NOD mice, such analogues can prevent

196 progression of the disease (24,25), which has been postulated to be due to the direct beta-cell

197 protective effects of 1,25(OH)2D combined with the blocking of inflammation, together with

198 the regulator T lymphocytes, which may be partly a direct effect on T lymphocytes, but also

199 via an effect on the central antigen presenting cells, the dendritic cells (26). In vitro, the

200 presence of 1,25(OH)2D or an analogue results in the generation of dendritic cells with

201 specific characteristics, such as less IL12 secretion, less CD80/CD86 expression, less MHC II

202 expression and most importantly less stimulation of effector T cells and specific generation of

203 regulator T cells (27, 28). Thus, a second possible avenue to exploit the potential beneficial

204 immune modulatory effects of vitamin D is the auto-transfer of ex vivo 1,25(OH)2D (or

205 analogue) -exposed dendritic cells generated from peripheral blood monocytes from patients

206 with T1DM. Upon transfer back into patients, these dendritic cells should be able to induce

207 regulator T cells and shift the immune system from attack towards tolerance towards the beta-

208 cell. Clinical trials exploring this potential therapeutic avenue are underway.

209

210 In population-based studies, low vitamin D concentration especially in early life, has been

211 associated with a higher risk for T1DM (1). Lower concentrations of 25(OH)D were reported

212 in North Indian (29), Italian (30), Swedish (31), and British (32) children or young adults

213 with newly diagnosed T1DM compared to controls. An increased prevalence of vitamin D

214 deficiency in children and adolescents with T1DM compared with non-diabetic individuals

215 was also observed in American (33), Australian (34) and Qatari (35) populations. Of interest,

216 there are also reported associations between polymorphisms of genes involved in the vitamin

217 D system and metabolism and type 1 diabetes risk islet autoimmunity risk (36,37).

218

219 Several observational studies have found that supplementation (based on self-reported data)

220 with vitamin D in early life is associated with a lower risk of T1DM in later life (38,39). In a

221 retrospective case-control study in Norway, intake of cod-liver oil by children during infancy

222 did not prevent T1DM, though there was a trend towards an inverse association (40). More

223 recently, the ABIS study in Sweden reported that the use of vitamin D-containing

224 supplements during pregnancy was associated with reduced development of autoantibodies to

225 GAD or IA-2A in offspring of T1DM parents at 1 year, but not at 2.5 years (41). In small

226 intervention studies, data on the effect of vitamin D supplements in patients with established

227 T1DM have been disappointing. For example, a study in Europe showed that administration

228 of 0.25 |ig 1,25(OH)2D3 was safe but failed to reduce loss of beta-cell function,  even in

229 patients with high C-peptide at diagnosis (42).

230

231 In summary, based on observational studies, vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25OHD < 12

232 ng/mL) should probably be avoided in individuals at high risk for developing T1DM,

233 specifically in early life. However, whether supplementation with high dose vitamin D or its

234 analogs have a therapeutic role in prevention or treatment of T1DM is presently under

235 investigation (Table 2).

236

### Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)

238

239 Among the multiple associations that have been reported between vitamin D status and

240 chronic diseases, the link between vitamin D and T2DM stands as one of the most promising

241 ones. The potential effect of vitamin D on glycemia appears to be mediated by direct and

242 indirect effects on three different pathways: insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and systemic

243 inflammation. A direct effect of vitamin D on insulin secretion may be mediated by activation

244 of vitamin D receptors in the pancreatic beta cells. Vitamin D receptor is expressed in

245 pancreatic cells and mice lacking vitamin D receptor have impaired insulin secretion (43). In

246 addition, the direct effect of vitamin D on insulin synthesis is supported by the presence of the

247 vitamin D response element in the human insulin gene promoter (44). Importantly, pancreatic

248 beta cells express CYP27B1, thereby generating 1,25(OH)2D locally, which allows for a

249 paracrine effect of vitamin D. A direct effect of vitamin D on insulin sensitivity may be

250 mediated by stimulating the expression of insulin receptors in peripheral insulin target cells.

251 In addition, vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased fat infiltration in skeletal

252 muscle, independent of body mass, which is thought to contribute to decreased insulin action.

253 Vitamin D may also decrease the effects of systemic inflammation, known to play an

254 important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM, in several ways, which include directly

255 modulating the expression and activity of cytokines in addition to several other non-cytokine

256 related immune-modulating effects (45). Finally, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity are

257 both calcium dependent processes (46,47); therefore, vitamin D could affect both pathways

258 indirectly, through alteration in calcium concentration and flux through the cell membranes of

259 the pancreas and insulin responsive tissues. 260

261 The data from observational studies strongly support an association between low vitamin D

262 status and incident T2DM. Recently, two meta-analyses of observational studies were

263 published with nearly identical results. Song et al. reported a 38% lower risk of developing

264 T2DM in the highest reference category of 25OHD compared to the lowest one (relative risk

265 0.62 <span>[95% CI 0.54-0.70]</span> (48) while Afzal et al. (49) reported an odds ratio for T2DM of 1.5

266 (95% CI 1.33-1.70) for the bottom versus top reference category of 25OHD.

267

268 Randomized studies have shown inconsistent results. In trials that included participants with

269 normal glucose tolerance or established diabetes at baseline, vitamin D supplementation had

270 no effect on glycemic measures or incident diabetes. It is crucial to note, however, that most

271 studies were underpowered or were post-hoc analyses of completed trials. In addition, the

272 results differed based on the adherence to vitamin D supplementation. For example, in a post-

273 analysis of the RECORD study, while supplementation with 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 did not

274 change the risk of self-reported type 2 diabetes, there was a notable trend towards reduction in

275 T2DM risk with vitamin D3 (odds ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.40-1.16) among study participants

276 who were highly compliant with supplementation (50).

277

278 Vitamin D supplementation appears to be more promising in patients who are at risk for

279 diabetes. In the Calcium and Vitamin D for type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CaDDM) study, a 2x2

280 factorial design trial in participants with pre-diabetes, vitamin D supplementation improved

281 disposition index, a measured of beta cell function (51). However, in another trial of non-

282 Caucasians, very high dose vitamin D supplementation had no effect on insulin secretion,

283 insulin sensitivity or incident diabetes in a population with impaired fasting glycemia or

284 impaired glucose tolerance and low vitamin D levels (52).

285

286 In summary, vitamin D appears to have no role in prevention of T2DM in the general

287 population; however, there might be a role for vitamin D for treatment of established T2DM

288 or prevention of T2DM in persons at risk, although the evidence from available trials is

289 inconsistent. There are several ongoing large randomized trials in well-defined populations

290 (D2d <span>[NCT01942694]</span>, VITAL <span>[NCT01633177]</span>, DDM2 <span>[NCT01736865]</span>, Table 2) to test the

291 hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency is a contributor to the pathogenesis of T2DM and to

292 define its role in prevention or therapy of T2DM.

293

### Vitamin D and Addison's disease

295

296 Addison's disease is a rare condition resulting from autoimmune mediated destruction of the

297 adrenal cortex and may present as either isolated adrenal deficiency or part of an autoimmune

298 polyendocrine syndrome.   Although the etiology of Addison's disease is largely elusive,

299 current concepts point to environmental factors acting as triggers in a background of genetic

300 susceptibility leading to destructive CD8-T-lymphocytic infiltration of the adrenal cortex and

301 characteristic 21-OHase antibody production (53). Although the main genetic susceptibility is

302 identified at the HLA locus (54), other susceptibility genes have been described, including in

303 the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (55) and CYP27B1 (56,57), similarly to other autoimmune

304 endocrine diseases (e.g., T1DM) (32). This shared genetic association led to the assumption

305 that the vitamin D system may be involved in critical pathophysiologic pathways in these

306 immune  mediated  inflammatory   disorders   since   active   1,25(OH)2D  may suppress

307 steroidogenesis by down-regulating CYP21A2 and up-regulating CYP11A1 and CYP17A1.

308 In an adrenal cell model  (NCI-H295R line) (58), vitamin D acts not only on the immune

309 system but also on the adrenal tissue itself.

310

311 Whether 25(OH)D concentrations differ between patients with autoimmune Addison's

312 disease and controls is not known and is currently under investigation. However, there is

313 evidence of interaction between vitamin D status and predisposing gene loci, similar to

314 findings in T1DM (34). In summary, preliminary evidence suggests that vitamin D may be

315 important in modifying genetic susceptibility in Addison's disease; however, much remains to

316 be studied on its functional and clinical relevance in humans.

317

### Vitamin D and Hashimoto's thyroiditis

319

320 Hashimoto's thyroiditis is predominantly a disease of cell-mediated immunity that is

321 manifested by a genetic defect in suppressor T-cell function. Th1 cells secrete various

322 cytokines  such  as  interferon  (IFN)-y which  induces thyrocytes  to  express major

323 histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) surface HLA-DR antigens and renders them

324 susceptible to immunologic attack. Although HLA-DR antigens are not physiologically

325 expressed on thyrocytes, in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the thyrocytes present HLA-DR antigens

326 on their surface, which may trigger autoimmune process. Activated by T lymphocytes, B

327 lymphocytes produce autoantibodies that react to thyroid antigens (59-62).

328 In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the autoimmune process may be suppressed at various stages by

329 1,25(OH)2D. At first, vitamin D might suppress dendritic cell-dependent T cell activation,

330 then, it might decrease proliferation of Th1 cells and the synthesis of Th 1 cell cytokines such

331 as IFN-y. Vitamin D may also inhibit expression of MHC II surface HLA-DR antigens on

332 thyrocytes by inhibiting the synthesis of IFN-y, which induces thyrocytes to express those

333 antigens. Furthermore, after being activated by T cells, B cells' ongoing proliferation may be

334 suppressed and B cell apoptosis may be induced by 1,25(OH)2D. In this way, vitamin D might

335 decrease autoantibodies that react with thyroid antigens (59-61).

336 Recently, studies have suggested that low vitamin D concentrations and other conditions

337 which may result with reduced vitamin D function (e.g., certain VDR gene polymorphism,

338 pathologies of vitamin D binding protein and its gene) may increase risk of Hashimoto's

339 thyroiditis (61,63-67). However, additional data are needed to clarify whether there is a link

340 between  vitamin  D   status   and  Hashimoto's  thyroiditis   and  whether  vitamin D

341 supplementation might reduce the risk of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

### Vitamin D and Graves' Disease

343 Graves' disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder in which TSH receptor autoantibodies

344 cause hyperthyroidism. Given the increasing interest in the role of vitamin D role in

345 determining susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, it has been hypothesized that Graves'

346 disease may also be affected by vitamin D, based upon its ability to modulate the immune

347 system by suppressing the proliferation of activated T cells and enhancing the phagocytic

348 ability of macrophages (68,69).

349

350 Polymorphism in the VDR gene and vitamin binding protein gene have been reported to be

351 associated to Graves' disease's etiology (70,71) probably via a reduction in vitamin D

352 function, which may have an inhibitory effect on regulatory steps within the immune system.

353 The reported effects appear to differ markedly among different ethnicities, e.g. ApaI, BsmI

354 and FokI polymorphisms in the VDR gene are associated with highersusceptibility to Graves'

355 disease in Asian populations, but do not appear to play a role in Caucasian population (72).

356 Further, Feng et al. (73), recently reported that BsmI and TaqI polymorphisms are

357 significantly associated with autoimmune thyroid disorder risk, while the ApaI or FokI

358 polymorphisms are not Women with new onset Graves' disease have decreased 25(OH)D concentration, which is

361 also associated with thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography (74). Furthermore, it has

362 been reported that 25(OH)D concentration is higher in patients who achieve remission

363 compared to those who do not (75). The current evidence to support a role of vitamin D in

364 Graves' disease is preliminary but is worth investigating further in observational and

365 intervention studies.

### Vitamin D and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

368

369 Accumulating evidence from several studies suggest that vitamin D may be involved in

370 several features of PCOS, such as infertility, hirsutism, insulin resistance and cardiovascular

371 risk (76,77). Wehr et al reported that women with normal ovulation had higher vitamin D

372 levels than women with PCOS (77). In addition, 25(OH)D deficiency was found to be

373 associated with lower rates of follicle development and pregnancy after stimulation in PCOS

374 women (78). Vitamin D supplementation may improve reproductive function in women with

375 PCOS by restoring normal menstrual cycles (79,80). Women with PCOS and hirsutism have

376 lower 25(OH)D levels than BMI matched controls (77, 81), which may be explained by an

377 association of vitamin D with androgens or SHBG (82,83). Vitamin D deficiency seems to

378 also have an impact on insulin sensitivity in PCOS women, as evaluated by HOMA-IR

379 (76,77,80). However, a more accurate evaluation of insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic

380 euglycemic clamp in PCOS women did not confirm such an association (84). In addition to

381 insulin resistance, vitamin D deficiency in PCOS women has been associated with

382 cardiovascular risk factors, such as high total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood

383 pressure, C reactive proteins and triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol (77). Small

384 uncontrolled intervention studies of vitamin D supplementation in women with PCOS have

385 shown improvements in fasting and stimulated glucose and dyslipidemia (triglycerides and

386 HDL) (80,85).

387 An inverse association between vitamin D status and metabolic and hormonal disturbances

388 has been reported in PCOS. However, due to the variability of the PCOS phenotype and the

389 heterogeneity of available studies, it is difficult to draw any conclusions. Ongoing randomized

390 trials in well-defined populations will help define the role of vitamin D in PCOS (Table 1).

391

### Limitations in the study of vitamin D

393

394 The inverse association between vitamin D status and endocrine disease in observational

395 studies may be confounded by several factors. Most importantly, good vitamin D status is

396 generally a marker of good health, as high 25(OH)D concentration is associated with young

397 age, normal body weight and a healthy lifestyle, including good dietary and exercise habits.

398 Similarly, a lower vitamin D status may reflect chronic illness, which prevents outdoor

399 activities and sun exposure. Importantly, vitamin D is rarely ingested in isolation, more often,

400 it is ingested as part of a specific food (e.g. milk), a food group (e.g. dairy) or as part of a

401 health dietary pattern (e.g. Mediterranean diet). Therefore, additional nutrients co-ingested

402 with vitamin D (e.g. fish or fortified dairy products) may have independent or synergistic

403 effects on cardiometabolic disease or, alternatively, foods rich in vitamin D may replace other

404 foods that increase risk of cardiometabolic disease (e.g. fortified milk replacing soda). Nearly

405 all available observational studies used single measurements of blood 25(OH)D as a proxy of

406 vitamin D status, which may not reflect vitamin D status over long periods as risk factors for

407 vitamin D deficiency increase with time (aging, declining physical activity, etc). Therefore,

408 inaccurate assessment of the exposure (vitamin D status) and uncontrolled or residual

409 confounding may explain the results of the observational studies, which needs to be

410 confirmed in controlled trials. An additional challenge in the study of vitamin D is that there

411 is no consensus on the 25(OH)D thresholds for vitamin D adequacy.

412

### Conclusions

415 Several observational studies have reported an association of low 25(OH)D concentration

416 with endocrine diseases. However, due to paucity of intervention studies, a causal link

417 between vitamin D deficiency and endocrine diseases is far from proven, thus no guidance

418 can be provided for or against recommending vitamin D supplementation for prevention or

419 therapy of endocrine conditions, outside of the current recommendations by the Institute of

420 Medicine for the general populations (600 to 800 IU/day depending on age and gender).

421 Ongoing and future trials are expected to provide answers to whether vitamin D

422 supplementation holds promise for endocrine health and disease.
