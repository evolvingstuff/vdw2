BACKGROUND:

Two vitamin D pregnancy supplementation trials were recently undertaken in South Carolina: The NICHD (n=346) and Thrasher Research Fund (TRF, n=163) studies. The findings suggest increased dosages of supplemental vitamin D were associated with improved health outcomes of both mother and newborn, including risk of preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation). How that risk was associated with 25(OH)D serum concentration, a better indicator of vitamin D status than dosage, by race/ethnic group and the potential impact in the community was not previously explored. While a recent IOM report suggested a concentration of 20 ng/mL should be targeted, more recent work suggests optimal conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D takes place at 40 ng/mL in pregnant women.

OBJECTIVE:

Post-hoc analysis of the relationship between 25(OH)D concentration and preterm birth rates in the NICHD and TRF studies with comparison to Charleston County, South Carolina March of Dimes (CC-MOD) published rates of preterm birth to assess potential risk reduction in the community.

METHODS:

Using the combined cohort datasets (n=509), preterm birth rates both for the overall population and for the subpopulations achieving 25(OH)D concentrations of ≤20 ng/mL, >20 to <40 ng/mL, and ≥40 ng/mL were calculated; subpopulations broken down by race/ethnicity were also examined. Log-binomial regression was used to test if an association between 25(OH)D serum concentration and preterm birth was present when adjusted for covariates; locally weighted regression (LOESS) was used to explore the relationship between 25(OH)D concentration and gestational age (weeks) at delivery in more detail. These rates were compared with 2009-2011CC-MOD data to assess potential risk reductions in preterm birth.

RESULTS:

Women with serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥40 ng/mL (n=233) had a  **57% lower risk of preterm birth**  compared to those with concentrations ≤20 ng/mL <span>[n=82; RR=0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.22,0.83]</span>; this lower risk was essentially unchanged after adjusting for covariates (RR=0.41, 95% CI=0.20,0.86). The fitted LOESS curve shows gestation week at birth initially rising steadily with increasing 25(OH)D and then plateauing at ∼40 ng/mL. Broken down by race/ethnicity, there was a 

*  **79% lower risk of preterm birth among Hispanic women**  with 25(OH)D concentrations ≥40 ng/mL (n=92) compared to those with 25(OH)D concentrations ≤20 ng/mL (n=29; RR=0.21, 95% CI=0.06,0.69) and a 

*  **45% lower risk among Black women**  (n=52 and n=50; RR=0.55, 95% CI=0.17,1.76). 

There were too few white women with low 25(OH)D concentrations for assessment (n=3). Differences by race/ethnicity were not statistically significant with 25(OH)D included as a covariate.

Fig. 1. 25(OH)D concentration within 6 weeks of delivery by gestational age (weeks) at birth (NICHD & TRF, N = 509). 

Term birth is 37 weeks of gestation; late preterm birth is 34 to <37 weeks; moderately preterm is 32 to <34 weeks; and very preterm is <32 weeks. 

 **White circles**  represent women assigned to the control group (400 IU/day); 

 **gray triangles**  represent women assigned to the 2000 IU/day treatment group; and 

 **solid black squares**  represent women assigned to the 4000 IU/day treatment group.
