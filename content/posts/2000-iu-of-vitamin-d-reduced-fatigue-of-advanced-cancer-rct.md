Background: Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of patients diagnosed with cancer. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in oncology patients. We conducted a prospective vitamin D (cholecalciferol) supplementation study to analyse the response to oral D3 supplementation on fatigue in this population of chemo-naïve patients. 

Methods: Eligibility critera included life expectancy  6 months, ECOG PS 0-3, low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 at the time of diagnosis (using cutoff value of 32 ng/mL), and normal serum calcium level. Cancer related fatigue was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue module (FACT-F). Patients were randomized to receive oral supplementation with **2,000 IU of Vitamin D3**  daily for 3 months with standard cancer treatment or to continue standard treatment without vit D3 supplementation. Primary endpoint was changes in the FACT-F scale. Secondary endpoints was improvement of vitamin D serum levels and safety. 

Results: 69 vit D deficient patients enrolled in the this study between November 2009 and November 2011 returned a baseline FACT-F. The mean serum 25(OH)D levels were  **18.7 ng/ml (SD = 7.4) at baseline** . Patients in experimental arm showed marked improvement from baseline in fatigue (p<0.05) and vitamin D serum levels after 3 months (p<0.001). There were significant difference in fatigue score in patients with experimental arm and control arm after 3 months of treatment (p< 0.001). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation resulted in a significant increase in Fatigue score and serum 25(OH)D levels in vitamin D deficient patients. Fatigue improve rapidly but remain worse in control arm. The safety profile of vitamin D  **in combination with chemotherapy or BSC**  was acceptable.
