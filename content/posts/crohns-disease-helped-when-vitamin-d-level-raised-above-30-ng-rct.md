* 8 of the 12 participants got to a level > 30 ng in 3 months in winter

* Many disease trials using vitamin D supplementation find 40 ng benefits are much better than those at 30 ng

* PDF noted that results were better at 40 ng, but they did not have enough participants getting to that level to make statistically significant conclusions

* Probably have gotten much better results if get > 40 ng by one or more of the following

1. Used a form of <a href="/posts/gut-friendly-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Gut-Friendly Vitamin D">vitamin D designed for use with poor gut function</a>

1. Used more IU/day - say >3,000 IU

1. Used a <a href="/posts/overview-loading-of-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Overview Loading of vitamin D">loading dose</a>

1. Used <a href="/posts/low-cost-cofactors-for-vitamin-d" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This post/category does not exist yet: Low cost cofactors for vitamin D">cofactors</a> – such as Vitamin K2

1. Trial lasting more than 3 months

Background Vitamin D (vitD) supplementation may prolong remission in Crohn’s disease (CD); however, the clinical efficacy and mechanisms are unclear.

Aim To determine changes in intestinal permeability (IP), antimicrobial peptide (AMP) concentrations and disease markers in CD, in response to vitD supplementation.

Methods In a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled study, we assigned 27 CD patients in remission to  **2000 IU/day vitD**  or placebo for 3 mos. We determined IP, plasma cathelicidin (LL-37 in ng/mL), human-beta-defensin-2 (hBD2 in pg/mL), disease activity (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)), C-reactive protein (CRP in mg/L), fecal calprotectin (µg/g), Quality of Life (QoL) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D in nmol/L) at 0 and 3 mos.

Results At 3 mos., 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly higher in those whom were treated (p < 0.001). Intra-group analysis showed increased LL-37 concentrations (p = 0.050) and maintenance of IP measures in the treated group. In contrast, in the placebo group, the small bowel (p = 0.018) and gastro-duodenal permeability (p = 0.030) increased from baseline. 

At 3 mos., patients with 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/L had significantly 

* lower CRP (p = 0.019), 

* higher QoL (p = 0.037), 

* higher LL-37 concentrations (p < 0.001) 

and non-significantly lower CDAI scores (p = 0.082), compared to those with levels <75 nmol/L.

Conclusion Short-term treatment with 2000 IU/day vitD significantly increased 25(OH)D levels in CD patients in remission and it was associated with increased LL-37 concentrations and maintenance of IP. Achieving 25(OH)D ≥ 75 nmol/l was accompanied by higher circulating LL-37, higher QoL scores and reduced CRP. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01792388).
