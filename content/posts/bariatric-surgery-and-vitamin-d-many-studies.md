#### Most people need >2,000 IU of vitamin D before and after Bariatric Surgery - meta-analysis Sept 2023

 **Vitamin D status and supplementation before and after Bariatric Surgery: Recommendations based on a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Rev Endocr Metab Disord. 2023 Sep 4. [doi: 10.1007/s11154-023-09831-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-023-09831-3)

Bariatric surgery is associated with a postoperative reduction of 25(OH) vitamin D levels (25(OH)D) and with skeletal complications. Currently, guidelines for 25(OH)D assessment and vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients, pre- and post-surgery, are still lacking. The aim of this work is to analyse systematically the published experience on 25(OH)D status and vitamin D supplementation, pre- and post-surgery, and to propose, on this basis, recommendations for management. 

Preoperatively, 18 studies including 2,869 patients were evaluated. Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency as defined by 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) was 85%, whereas when defined by 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was 57%. The median preoperative 25(OH)D level was 19.75 ng/mL. 

After surgery, 39 studies including 5,296 patients were analysed and among those undergoing either malabsorptive or restrictive procedures, a lower rate of vitamin D insufficiency and higher 25(OH)D levels postoperatively were observed in patients treated with high-dose oral vitamin D supplementation, defined as ≥ 2,000 IU/daily (mostly D3-formulation), compared with low-doses (< 2,000 IU/daily). 

Our recommendations based on this systematic review and meta-analysis should help clinical practice in the assessment and management of vitamin D status  **before and after bariatric surgery.**  Assessment of vitamin D should be performed pre- and postoperatively in all patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Regardless of the type of procedure, high-dose supplementation is recommended in patients after bariatric surgery.

Vitamin D status affects the clinical and corporal outcomes of postoperative patients who undergo a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adequate vitamin D serum concentrations on thyroid hormones, body weight, blood cell count, and inflammation after an RYGB. A prospective observational study was conducted with eighty-eight patients from whom we collected blood samples before and 6 months after surgery to evaluate their levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D, thyroid hormones, and their blood cell count. Their body weight, body mass index (BMI), total weight loss, and excess weight loss were also evaluated 6 and 12 months after surgery. After 6 months, 58% of the patients achieved an adequate vitamin D nutritional status. Patients in the adequate group showed a decrease in the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.01 vs. 2.22 pUI/mL, p = 0.017) with lower concentrations than the inadequate group at 6 months (2.22 vs. 2.84 pUI/mL, p = 0.020). Six months after surgery, the group with vitamin D adequacy showed a significantly lower BMI compared with the inadequate group at 12 months (31.51 vs. 35.04 kg/m2, p = 0.018). An adequate vitamin D nutritional status seems to favor a significant improvement in one's thyroid hormone levels, immune inflammatory profile, and weight loss performance after an RYGB.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adequate vitamin D serum concentrations on thyroid hormones, body weight, blood cell count, and inflammation after an RYGB. A prospective observational study was conducted with eighty-eight patients from whom we collected blood samples before and 6 months after surgery to evaluate their levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D, thyroid hormones, and their blood cell count. Their body weight, body mass index (BMI), total weight loss, and excess weight loss were also evaluated 6 and 12 months after surgery. After 6 months, 58% of the patients achieved an adequate vitamin D nutritional status. Patients in the adequate group showed a decrease in the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.01 vs. 2.22 pUI/mL, p = 0.017) with lower concentrations than the inadequate group at 6 months (2.22 vs. 2.84 pUI/mL, p = 0.020). Six months after surgery, the group with vitamin D adequacy showed a significantly lower BMI compared with the inadequate group at 12 months (31.51 vs. 35.04 kg/m2, p = 0.018).

__Vitamin D status and supplementation before and after Bariatric Surgery: Recommendations based on a systematic review and meta-analysis__

Bariatric surgery is associated with a postoperative reduction of 25(OH) vitamin D levels (25(OH)D) and with skeletal complications. Currently, guidelines for 25(OH)D assessment and vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients, pre- and post-surgery, are still lacking. The aim of this work is to analyse systematically the published experience on 25(OH)D status and vitamin D supplementation, pre- and post-surgery, and to propose, on this basis, recommendations for management. 
Preoperatively, 18 studies including 2,869 patients were evaluated. Prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency as defined by 25(OH)D &lt; 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) was 85%, whereas when defined by 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was 57%. The median preoperative 25(OH)D level was 19.75 ng/mL. 
After surgery, 39 studies including 5,296 patients were analysed and among those undergoing either malabsorptive or restrictive procedures, a lower rate of vitamin D insufficiency and higher 25(OH)D levels postoperatively were observed in patients treated with high-dose oral vitamin D supplementation, defined as ≥ 2,000 IU/daily (mostly D3-formulation), compared with low-doses (&lt; 2,000 IU/daily). 
Our recommendations based on this systematic review and meta-analysis should help clinical practice in the assessment and management of vitamin D status __before and after bariatric surgery.__ Assessment of vitamin D should be performed pre- and postoperatively in all patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Regardless of the type of procedure, high-dose supplementation is recommended in patients after bariatric surgery.

Vitamin D status affects the clinical and corporal outcomes of postoperative patients who undergo a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adequate vitamin D serum concentrations on thyroid hormones, body weight, blood cell count, and inflammation after an RYGB. A prospective observational study was conducted with eighty-eight patients from whom we collected blood samples before and 6 months after surgery to evaluate their levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH)D, thyroid hormones, and their blood cell count. Their body weight, body mass index (BMI), total weight loss, and excess weight loss were also evaluated 6 and 12 months after surgery. After 6 months, 58% of the patients achieved an adequate vitamin D nutritional status. Patients in the adequate group showed a decrease in the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.01 vs. 2.22 pUI/mL, p = 0.017) with lower concentrations than the inadequate group at 6 months (2.22 vs. 2.84 pUI/mL, p = 0.020). Six months after surgery, the group with vitamin D adequacy showed a significantly lower BMI compared with the inadequate group at 12 months (31.51 vs. 35.04 kg/m2, p = 0.018). An adequate vitamin D nutritional status seems to favor a significant improvement in one&#39;s thyroid hormone levels, immune inflammatory profile, and weight loss performance after an RYGB.
