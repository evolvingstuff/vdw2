 **They were relucaant to state suspecitions  
and wanted to only state known facts  
unfortunately, the facts turned out to be only a faction of the airborne transmission** 

* "Early in the pandemic, the World Health Organization stated that SARS-CoV-2 was not transmitted through the air. That mistake and the prolonged process of correcting it sowed confusion and raises questions about what will happen in the next pandemic."

* " On 23 December(2021), the World Health Organization (WHO) uttered the one word it had previously seemed incapable of applying to the virus SARS-CoV-2: ‘airborne’."

* "The seemingly uncontroversial statement marked a clear shift for the Switzerland-based WHO, which had tweeted categorically early in the pandemic,  **“FACT: #COVID19 is NOT airborne,”**  casting the negative in capital letters as if to remove any doubt"

* The WHO was presented with information about airborne transmission in April 2020, but chose to ignore it as it disagreed with their expert's consensus

 **Airborne transmission.**  Research shows that the virus can live in the air for up to 3 hours. It can get into your lungs if someone who has it breathes out and you breathe that air in. Experts are divided on how often the virus spreads through the airborne route and how much it contributes to the pandemic.
