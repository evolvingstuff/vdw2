One obvious next step is finding the optimum scenario that provides maximum net health gains.</p><p>Aim: This paper aims to show a method for finding the optimum scenario that provides maximum net health gains.</p><p>Methods: A multiple scenario simulation. The method is presented using vitamin D intake in Denmark as an example. In addition to the reference scenario, several alternative scenarios are simulated to detect the scenario that provides maximum net health gains. As a common health metric, Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) has been used to project the net health effect by using the QALIBRA (Quality of Life for Benefit Risk Assessment) software.</p><p>Results: The method used in the vitamin D example shows that it is feasible to find an optimum scenario that provides maximum net health gain in health risk-benefit assessment of dietary exposure as expressed by serum vitamin D level. With regard to the vitamin D assessment, a considerable health gain is observed due to the reduction of risk of other cause mortality, fall and hip fractures when changing from the reference to the optimum scenario.</p><p>Conclusion: The method allowed us to find the optimum serum level in the vitamin D example. Additional case studies are needed to further validate the applicability of the approach to other nutrients or foods, especially with regards to the uncertainty that is usually attending the data.</p><p><strong>Equation</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/qol-equation.jpg alt=image width=700><p><strong>Data - 400-850 IU</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/qol-data.jpg alt=image width=700><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/51-optimum-risk-benefit-vit-d-berjia.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki.</a></strong></p><hr><h3 id=qol-systematic-review--jan-2015>QoL Systematic Review – Jan 2015</h3><p><strong>Vitamin D Supplementation and Health-Related Quality of Life: A Systematic Review of the Literature.</strong></p><p>J Acad Nutr Diet. 2015 Jan 6. pii: S2212-2672(14)01604-9. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2014.10.023.>doi: 10.1016/j.jand.2014.10.023.</a> <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span></p><p>Hoffmann MR, Senior PA, Mager DR.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are highly prevalent worldwide and thought to potentiate a variety of chronic disease states, including diabetes, cancer, and depression. Routine vitamin D supplementation is often needed to meet vitamin D requirements. Little is known regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on quality of life. The purpose of this article was to systematically review the literature regarding quality-of-life outcomes from vitamin D supplementation in healthy and clinical populations. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, where quality-of-life outcomes were reported, were selected from Medline and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were English language articles available online (published between 1950 and May 2014), primary research articles, studies conducted on human beings, and treatment/supplementation with vitamin D. Articles were excluded if they involved topical vitamin D application or implicit cotreatment with other vitamins (eg, multivitamins). Articles selected for review were examined for process and methodologic quality using validated methodologies. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria for review. Interventions were highly variable in terms of study population (eg, healthy/diseased, children/elderly, and baseline vitamin D status) vitamin D dose, and duration of follow-up. Vitamin D supplementation ranged from 400 IU/day for an average of 7.1 years, to a single 300, 000 IU dose. The main tools used to capture quality of life were adaptations of validated, questionnaires (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item questionnaire and EuroQOL five dimension questionnaire). Vitamin D supplementation was not associated with significant changes in quality of life. Studies that reported changes in quality of life as a result of vitamin D supplementation were in clinical populations on short-term vitamin D. Most articles reviewed displayed poor methodologic quality (eg, no randomization/blinding, dropout description, or vitamin D assessment). <strong>Current evidence indicates that vitamin D supplementation may have a small to moderate effect on quality of life when used on a short-term basis in diseased populations</strong> . However, the evidence for a beneficial effect of long-term vitamin D supplementation on health-related quality of life is lacking.</p><p>PMID: 25573654</p><hr><h3 id=elderly-qol-2x-better-if-high-vitamin-d-sept-2014>Elderly QoL 2X better if high vitamin D Sept 2014</h3><p><strong>Associations of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations with quality of life and self-rated health in an older population.</strong></p><p>J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2014 Sep;99(9):3136-43. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2013-4431.>doi: 10.1210/jc.2013-4431.</a> Epub 2014 Jun 2.</p><p>Rafiq R1, Swart KM, van Schoor NM, Deeg DJ, Lips P, de Jongh RT.</p><p>1Department of Internal Medicine and Endocrinology (R.R., P.L., R.T.d.J.), VU University Medical Center, and Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics (K.M.A.S., N.M.v.S., D.J.D., P.L.), EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, VU University Medical Center, VU University Medical Center, 1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p><p>CONTEXT:</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with impaired physical functioning, depression, and several chronic diseases and might thereby affect quality of life and self-rated health.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess relationships of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> with quality of life and self-rated health and to examine whether physical performance, depressive symptoms, and number of chronic diseases mediate these relationships.</p><p>DESIGN:</p><p>We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, an ongoing population-based cohort study of older Dutch individuals.</p><p>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D was classified into the following categories: less than 25, 25-50, and 50 nmol/L or greater.

Vitamin D level at the start of the study and the total HRQoL score of the patients showed significant correlation (r=0.2599, p-value = 0.0234).</p><p>But when analyzed separately, only PWB showed significant correlation with Vitamin D levels at the start of the study (r= 0.2241, p-value of=0.0561). The results after 8 weeks showed significant correlation in the improvement of Vitamin D level in percent change from baseline, with regards to the improvement in PWB, SFWB, and total HRQoL (r = 0.2310, p-value = 0.0447; r = 0.3643, p-value= 0.0012; r= 0.2560, p-value = 0.0256, respectively). However, EWB did not show correlation with improvement in Vitamin D level while FWB showed negative correlation ( r= 0.0034, p-value of 0.1342, r= -0.1734, p-value 0.9764, respectively).</p><p>CONCLUSION: This study showed that when Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was corrected, there was indeed a positive effect on physical, social and family well-being and overall HRQoL of patients. The result of this study suggests benefit in achieving a normal Vitamin D level in improving quality of life of patients.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li><p>Holick, et al.

There was little data regarding insufficient vitamin D status and its adverse effect on health of elderly Chinese people. So we selected 686 subjects (310 men and 376 women) aged 60 to 89 years to explore the correlation between vitamin D status and their life quality in a community-based osteoporosis prevention study at Qianfoshan Hospital of Shandong University from 2009 to 2010.</p><p>All subjects were divided into three groups: vitamin D</p><ul><li><p>adequacy <a href=serum%2025(OH)D%20%E2%89%A7%2075%20nmol/L>serum 25(OH)D ≧ 75 nmol/L</a>,</p></li><li><p>hypovitaminosis D (50–74.9 nmol/L), and vitamin D</p></li><li><p>insufficiency (&lt; 50 nmol/L).</p></li></ul><p>Participants were requested to complete <strong>SF–36 health survey</strong> .
