"We know estrogen protects against bone loss, but does it protect against skin wrinkles?" 

"The link between the two could be collagen, . . . "

They (endocrinologists) are considering estrogen therapy for skin - which apparently works for bones

#### [WebMD](http://women.webmd.com/news/20110607/facial-wrinkles-linked-to-lower-bones-density)

"Pal thinks the connection may be a protein called type 1 collagen, a building block of skin and bone tissue, which is lost with age. 

It is thought that this loss may be accelerated during menopause, when hormone levels drop."

Certain wrinkles were more predictive of lower bone density than others.

"The strongest association of the facial wrinkles with the bone was between the eyebrows," 

"When we looked at the effects of sun exposure on skin, we did not see that women who had more sun exposure had worse skin wrinkles," Pal says.
