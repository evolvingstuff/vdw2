There are several studies in which a correlation between maternal vitamin D deficiency and serum mineral disorders in the mother and the newborn has been reported. The present randomised clinical trial was designed to investigate the effect of vitamin D administration on maternal and fetal Ca and vitamin D status. The trial was carried out on 160 pregnant women. Vitamin D-deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 30 ng/ml) pregnant women were recruited at 26-28 weeks of pregnancy. In the control group, a multivitamin supplement containing 400 IU vitamin D3/d was given. Patients in the treatment group were treated with  **50 000 IU vitamin D3 weekly for a total duration of 8 weeks** . At delivery, maternal and fetal Ca and 25(OH)D levels in both groups were compared. 

In total, 81 % of pregnant women were vitamin D deficient. At the time of delivery, Ca and vitamin D levels were higher in the treatment group compared with the control group (92 (sd 3) v. 85 (sd 4) mg/l, respectively, P= 0·001 for serum Ca; 47·8 (sd 11·1) v. 15·9 (sd 6·6) ng/ml, respectively, P< 0·001 for vitamin D). 

At the time of delivery, 32·7 % of women in the control group had hypocalcaemia, while  **no hypocalcaemic case was detected in the vitamin D-treated group** . 

Mean neonatal serum 25(OH)D was higher in the treatment group compared with the control group (27·7 (sd 5·2) v.10·9 (sd 4·4) ng/ml, respectively, P< 0·01). 

The neonatal Ca level in the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the control group (99 (sd 3) v. 91 (sd 3) mg/l, respectively, P< 0·001). The administration of vitamin D to pregnant women with vitamin D deficiency improves both maternal and neonatal Ca levels.

 **Effect of treatment of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency during pregnancy on fetal growth indices and maternal weight gain: a randomized clinical trial.**

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment of low serum vitamin D in pregnant women improves fetal growth indices.

STUDY DESIGN: In this open-label randomized clinical trial, 130 Iranian pregnant women (24-26 weeks of gestation) with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency [25(OH)D <30ng/ml](25(OH)D%20<30ng/ml) were divided at random into an intervention group and a control group. The control group received 200mg calcium plus a multivitamin (containing vitamin D3 400U) each day, and the intervention group received 200mg calcium plus a multivitamin (containing vitamin D3 400U) each day, plus vitamin D3 (50,000U) each week for 8 weeks. At delivery, maternal and cord blood 25(OH)D levels, maternal weight gain, neonatal length, neonatal weight and neonatal head circumference were compared between two groups. Serum vitamin D was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to examine the independent effect of maternal vitamin D level on fetal growth indices.

RESULTS: Mean (±standard deviation)

* length (intervention group: 49±1.6cm; control group: 48.2±1.7cm; p=0.001), 

* head circumference (intervention group: 35.9±0.7cm; control group: 35.3±1.0cm; p=0.001) and 

* weight (intervention group: 3429±351.9g; control group: 3258.8±328.2g; p=0.01) 

were higher in the intervention group compared with the control group. 

Mean  **maternal weight gain**  was higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (13.3±2.4kg vs 11.7±2.7kg; p=0.006). 

Multivariate regression analysis for 

* maternal weight gain, 

* neonatal length, 

* neonatal weight and 

* neonatal head circumference 

showed an independent correlation with maternal vitamin D level.

CONCLUSION: Treatment of low serum vitamin D during pregnancy improves fetal growth indices and maternal weight gain.
