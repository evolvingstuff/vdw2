#### Prevalence of diabetes has risen or at best remained unchanged in virtually every part of the world over the last three decades

   * had been 8.3 per cent of men, 9.8 per cent of men = 350 million in 2008

   * biggest rise appears to be those equatorial areas which have gotten air conditioning since the study began (1980)

Diabetes has taken off most dramatically in Pacific Island nations, which now have the highest diabetes levels in the world. 

In the 

* Marshall Islands, one in three women and one in four men have diabetes. 

Glucose and diabetes were also particularly high in 

* south Asia, 

* Latin America, the 

* Caribbean, 

* Central Asia, 

* North Africa and the 

* Middle East.

Background

Data for trends in glycaemia and diabetes prevalence are needed to understand the effects of diet and lifestyle within populations, assess the performance of interventions, and plan health services. No consistent and comparable global analysis of trends has been done. We estimated trends and their uncertainties in mean  **fasting plasma glucose (FPG)**  and diabetes prevalence for adults aged 25 years and older in 199 countries and territories.

Methods

We obtained data from health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (370 country-years and 2·7 million participants). We converted systematically between different glycaemic metrics. For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean FPG and its uncertainty by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally, subnationally, or community representative.

Findings

In 2008, global age-standardised mean FPG was 5·50 mmol/L (95% uncertainty interval 5·37—5·63) for men and 5·42 mmol/L (5·29—5·54) for women, having risen by 0·07 mmol/L and 0·09 mmol/L per decade, respectively. Age-standardised adult diabetes prevalence was 9·8% (8·6—11·2) in men and 9·2% (8·0—10·5) in women in 2008, up from 8·3% (6·5—10·4) and 7·5% (5·8—9·6) in 1980. The number of people with diabetes increased from 153 (127—182) million in 1980, to 347 (314—382) million in 2008. 

We recorded almost no change in mean FPG in east and southeast Asia and central and eastern Europe. 

Oceania had the largest rise, and the highest mean FPG (6·09 mmol/L, 5·73—6·49 for men; 6·08 mmol/L, 5·72—6·46 for women) and diabetes prevalence (15·5%, 11·6—20·1 for men; and 15·9%, 12·1—20·5 for women) in 2008. 

Mean FPG and diabetes prevalence in 2008 were also high in south Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and central Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East. 

Mean FPG in 2008 was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and high-income Asia-Pacific. 

In high-income subregions, western Europe had the smallest rise, 0·07 mmol/L per decade for men and 0·03 mmol/L per decade for women; North America had the largest rise, 0·18 mmol/L per decade for men and 0·14 mmol/L per decade for women.

Interpretation

Glycaemia and diabetes are rising globally, driven both by population growth and ageing and by increasing age-specific prevalences. 

Effective preventive interventions are needed, and health systems should prepare to detect and manage diabetes and its sequelae.
