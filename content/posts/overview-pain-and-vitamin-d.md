#### Vitamin D and Chronic Pain - Nov 2013

 **[The health Haven](http://thehealthyhavenblog.com/2013/11/22/vitamin-d-and-chronic-pain/)** 

* People with inadequate vitamin D blood levels will need to take twice as much narcotic pain medication as those with adequate vitamin D for pain relief. So, while vitamin D does not cure chronic pain, it is an important adjuvant therapy to use in pain treatment management.

* Research studies on vitamin D have shown that many types of fatigue and chronic pain are linked to vitamin D deficiency, including chronic musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia syndrome, osteoarthritis, migraine headaches, rheumatic pain and hyperesthesia.

* 'For patients who do not respond to other therapy, vitamin D supplementation is recommended to alleviate or perhaps even resolve chronic fatigue and pain issues

#### Pain relievers can extend duration of back pain - and sometimes turning it into a chronic pain - May 2022

 **[Common Medications Can Prolong Back Pain, Study Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/health/medications-back-pain-overuse.html) New York Times** 

* "Guidelines from professional medical societies already say that people with back pain should start with nondrug treatments like exercise, physical therapy, heat or massage. Those measures turn out to be as effective as pain-suppressing drugs, without the same side effects."

* Biobank stiudy found  ...2,163 people with acute back pain, 461 of whom went on to have chronic pain. Those taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory had  **nearly double the chance of developing chronic back pain**  as those taking other drugs or no drugs, the researchers found.

* "An analysis of randomized clinical trials found that these drugs had almost no benefit over placeboes in reducing low back pain."

#### Pain Factoids from the Body by Bill Bryson, 2019

* Chronic pain has no purpose. It’s just a system gone wrong, in the same way that cancer is a system gone wrong. We now believe that many types of chronic pain are diseases in their own right, something quite separate from acute pain.”

* The International Classification of Headache Disorders recognizes fourteen categories of headaches—migraine, trauma-induced headache, infection-induced headache, disorder of homeostasis, and so on.

* According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, about 40 percent of adult Americans—100 million people—are experiencing chronic pain at any given moment.

* Altogether chronic pain affects more people than cancer, heart disease, and diabetes combined.

* Andrew Rice, a pain researcher at Imperial College London, told Nature in 2016, “The drugs we have relieve 50 percent of pain in somewhere between one in four and one in seven of the patients we treat. That’s for the best drugs.” In other words, some 75 percent to 85 percent of people get no benefit at all from even the best pain drugs, and those who do get benefit don’t usually get much.
