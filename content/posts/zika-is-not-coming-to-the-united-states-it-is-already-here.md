#### Peak of Ebola in the US was perhaps 10 people, Zika already has least 300

* [At least 292 pregnant women in the US now have Zika](/posts/of-us-pregnant-women-who-were-tested-for-zika-279-were-positive-how-many-are-actually-infected)

* That is probably a vast undercount 

> - the CDC is not saying how they determin whom to test, nor how many pregnant women fail the test

> Note: The test only detects Zika infection during previous several weeks, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- ignoring ealier infections which could have resulted in birth defects

* Unknown number of US adults have Zika - which could be spread if bitten by the Zika mosquito

>  **And, the mosquito season is just about to start.** .

* "It is not a question of whether babies will be born in the United States with Zika-related microcephaly — it is a question of when and how many"

* Includes a nice 3 minute video summary of Zika

> >1,000,000 confirmed cases of Zika infection so far in Brazil

> >7,000 cases of microcephaly in Brazil, 944 confirmed

> Does not mention the huge number of other Zika birth defects - virtually undetectable in the womb
