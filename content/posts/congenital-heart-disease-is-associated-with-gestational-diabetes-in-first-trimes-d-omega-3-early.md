* 19,107 mothers,, 811 babies with congenital heart disease.(4%)

* “[The study, in The Journal of Pediatrics](http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(17)31457-9/fulltext%20), found that for each 10 milligrams per deciliter increase in plasma glucose, there was an 8 percent increase in the risk for giving birth to a baby with heart defects”

* NYT article recommends 1 hour of exercise daily during pregnancy to reduce gestational diabetes

* No mention in NYT of the reduction of Gestational Diabetes by both Vitamin D and Omega-3

> "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common types of birth defects, "

> "CHDs affect nearly 1% of―or about 40,000―births per year in the United States."

> "About 20% to 30% of people with a CHD have other physical problems or developmental or cognitive disorders"

> "In 2005, for a privately insured population in the Unites States, the estimated medical care costs for an average infant with any CHD was about $23,000, and costs were higher for infants with a severe CHD"

 **Thus, on average, we would only save $230 in average medical birth costs if totally eliminated Congenital heart defects  
Preventing premature births is far more cost effective than preventing CHD**
