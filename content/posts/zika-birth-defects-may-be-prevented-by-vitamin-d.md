 **<span style="color:#00F;">SUSPECT: Asymptomatic people have  more vitamin D in the cells</span>** 

* Note: Many [genes](/categories/genetics), such as [Vitamin D Receptor](/categories/vitamin-d-receptor) restrict vitamin D in blood from from being used

* Note: Taking more Vitamin D resuls in having more vitamin D in cells independant of genes

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Attempting to get data: Email sent to 30 scientists and doctors around the world on June 5</span>** 

 **You may be able to prevent thousands of Zika related birth defects.** 

* We are writing to you because we believe that supplementing with sufficient Vitamin D may be able to strengthen immune systems in pregnant women enough to prevent Zika birth defects.

* Vitamin D has been studied and proven to effectively counter similar viruses.

* If healthy vitamin D levels can protect pregnant mothers and their unborn babies against Zika then a very low cost treatment program would be available for millions at risk.

* We are looking for data to prove or disprove this hypothesis.

* We need Vitamin D measurements for at least 100 symptomatic plus 100 asymptomatic adults of either sex that have tested positive for Zika.

* We’re asking for your help, in three possible ways:

> 1) You can provide that data from your own research

> 2) You know of a study or studies which have that data

> 3) You know someone else who might have that data

* If you can help, please respond or forward this email to someone who might have the data.

* Time is of the essence. Thank you.

 **<span style="color:#00F;">UPDATE June 9:  Vitamin D might increase a protein (IFITM) which stops viral diseases like Zika</span>** 

* See [Virus (Zika, etc.) replication is restricted by IFITM proteins – June 2016](/posts/virus-zika-etc-replication-is-restricted-by-ifitm-proteins)

> with email from VitaminDWiki to the author at the bottom of the page

 **<span style="color:#00F;">CONCLUSION: Increased Vitamin D will greatly reduce Zika birth defects</span>** 

* Strong maternal and placenta immune systems will prevent fetus from being infected by Zika virus

* Note: Vitamin D supplementation might eliminate viral symptoms in adults (both Zika and Dengue)
