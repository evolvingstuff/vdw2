#### Vitamin D in Foot and Ankle Fracture Healing: A Literature Review and Research Design.

Foot Ankle Spec. 2015 May 11. pii: 1938640015585958. <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

Vitamin D is a generic name for a group of essential vitamins, or secosteroids, important in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Specifically, efficacy of vitamin D with regard to bone healing is in question. A literature review was performed, finding mostly large studies involving vitamin D effects on prevention of fractures and randomized animal model studies consisting of controlled fractures with vitamin D interventions. The prevention articles generally focus on at-risk populations, including menopausal women and osteoporotic patients, and also most often include calcium in the treatment group. Few studies look at vitamin D specifically. The animal model studies often focus more on vitamin D supplementation; however the results are still largely inconclusive. While recent case reports  **appear promising** , the ambiguity of results on the topic of fracture healing suggests a need for more, higher level research. A novel study design is proposed to help determine the efficacy on vitamin D in fracture healing.
