Objective: One of the factors implicated in increased risk of developing MS is low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). MS, on the other hand, may affect the quality of life of the patients’ including physical and social functioning among others. The aim of this study was to investigate 25(OH)D levels and to assess health related quality of life of patients by giving emphasis to possible correlations between these variables.

Material and methods: Fifty MS patients and 30 controls were enrolled in the study. Gender and age of patients, duration of disease, MS subtypes, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and duration of sunlight exposure were recorded, 25(OH)D levels and bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were all performed. All the subjects in both groups were administered Short Form-36 (SF-36) for the assessment of quality of life.

Results: 25(OH)D levels were found to be significantly decreased in MS patients (p < 0.05). BMD values including L1–L4 t score, L1–L4 z score, femur neck t and z scores were significantly reduced in the patient group (p < 0.05). All SF-36 subscale scores were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in MS group and all SF-36 subscale scores except bodily pain were significantly correlated with the EDSS scores.

Conclusion: 25(OH)D and BMD screening should be considered as a routine procedure in the assessment of MS patients. In the long term treatment and follow-up of patients with MS, functional outcomes and quality of life issues should be kept in mind by all the physicians engaged in MS.

Highlights: 

* In this study our aim was to investigate 25(OH)D levels and quality of life of MS patients. 

* 25(OH)D levels and bone mineral density (BMD) values were significantly decreased in MS patients. 

* All SF-36 subscale scores were significantly lower in the MS group. 

* We conclude that 25(OH)D, BMD screening and quality of life issues are very important for MS patients.
