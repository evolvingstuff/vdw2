Let’s talk about the best nutrient for autoimmune conditions. This information is based on an interesting protocol developed by Dr. Coimbra.

According to Dr. Coimbra, “all or nearly all patients with an autoimmune disease have an increased resistance to the effects of vitamin D.”

So, someone with an autoimmune disease may have not only a deficiency of vitamin D but also a resistance to vitamin D. This means that to raise the vitamin D levels in patients with an autoimmune condition, they may require a much higher dose than the average person without an autoimmune disorder.

In general, the medical health care system recommends taking only 600 IU of vitamin D per day. However, other credible sources discuss taking at least 10,000 IU of vitamin D with no risks.

The chemistry of vitamin D is very similar to steroid hormones. With an autoimmune condition, your immune system is out of control and is attacking itself. But, one of the incredible functions of vitamin D is its ability to act as an immune regulator. Vitamin D can also help reduce inflammation, which is common in autoimmune conditions. The more resistant you are to vitamin D, the higher your risk is for autoimmune disease and other conditions.

Other potential causes of resistance to vitamin D:

* Vitamin D polymorphism

* Darker skin

* Metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance 

* Obesity

* Age

* A lack of vitamin D in the diet

* A lack of sun exposure

Keep in mind that it’s very important to find a doctor that is experienced with the Coimbra protocol to work with you while doing the protocol. This protocol determines the vitamin D dosage by measuring your parathyroid hormone.

The goal of this protocol is to drop your parathyroid hormone into the lower level of the normal range. The amount of vitamin D that someone would take could range from 40,000 IU per day to 200,000 IU per day. To minimize the main potential side effect of this protocol (hypercalcemia), you would want to avoid calcium and drink 2.5 liters of fluid per day. Contact a doctor who is experienced in the Coimbra protocol to get started. Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 57, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.
