### <span style="color:#F00;">Humans need more vitamin D</span>

### Notes

* IU is typically per kilogram of feed

> It seems that a human adult eats about 2 kg of dry food/day, so might multiply by 2X for adult 

* They often also use HyD â€“ a semi-activated form of Vitamin D

* They also use vitamin K3 

> "Menadione is metabolized by the human body into K2"  [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menadione)

> In the United States, menadione supplements are banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because of their potential toxicity in human use. Low-dose menadione is still used as an inexpensive micronutrient for livestock in many countries. Forms of menadione are also included in some pet foods in developed countries as a source of vitamin K. These doses have yielded no reported cases of toxicity from menadione in livestock or pets.
