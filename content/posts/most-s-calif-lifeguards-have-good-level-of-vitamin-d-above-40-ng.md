 **GrassrootsHealth tested the vitamin D serum levels of a group of Southern California Beach Lifeguards at the end of summer.  As shown in the chart below, the majority of the lifeguards (69%) had 25(OH)D concentrations ≥40 ng/ml.  All of the lifeguards reported not taking any vitamin D supplements.**
