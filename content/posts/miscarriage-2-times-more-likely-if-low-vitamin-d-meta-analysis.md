*  **Note Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy often does not start until second trimester â€“ which is too late to reduce miscarriages**

BACKGROUND: he association between vitamin D deficiency and early spontaneous pregnancy loss (SPL) is unclear.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and SPL.

SEARCH STRATEGY: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for relevant papers published before February 20, 2016, using search terms including "vitamin D" and "pregnancy loss."

SELECTION CRITERIA: Case-control and cohort studies investigating the relationship of maternal serum 25(OH)D and SPL were included.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted original data from the selected papers. The DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed by calculating I2 .

MAIN RESULTS: Five studies, including 10 630 pregnant women, met the inclusion criteria. There was no significant association between a low 25(OH)D level and an increased risk of SPL. 

In a subgroup analysis, an extremely low 25(OH)D level (<20 ng/mL) was significantly associated with an increased risk of SPL in the first trimester (relative risk **2.24** , 95% confidence interval 1.15-4.37); the heterogeneity across studies was not significant (I2 =0.0%, P=0.355).

CONCLUSIONS: Severe Vitamin D deficiency could be detrimental to early embryonic development and increase the risk of early SPL
