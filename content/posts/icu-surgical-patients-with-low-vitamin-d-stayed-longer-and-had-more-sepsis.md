Background: The incidence of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients is reported to be up to 50%, with a  **3-fold increase in predicted mortality** , but limited data exist concerning vitamin D deficiency in critically ill surgical patients.

Methods Sixty-six adult surgical intensive care unit patients who had 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels evaluated from January 2010 to February 2011 were prospectively identified. Patients were divided into groups according to vitamin D level (<20 vs ?20 ng/mL).

Results Of the 66 patients evaluated, 49 (74%) had vitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL, and 17 (26%) had vitamin D levels >20 ng/mL. 

 **Patients with vitamin D levels < 20 versus >20 ng/mL had longer lengths of hospital stay.** 

Lengths of intensive care unit stay were clinically longer, although not significant. 

Infection rates tended to be higher (P = .09), and a higher incidence of sepsis was seen in the patients with vitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL.

Conclusions Vitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL have a significant impact on length of stay, organ dysfunction, and infection rates. 

More data are needed on the value of supplementation to improve these outcomes.
