Older people are prone to frailness, present poor adherence to pharmacotherapy, and often have adverse drug effects. Therefore, it is important to develop effective and safe interventions to mitigate the burden of anxiety and depression disorders in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the anxiety and depression status of elderly people with prediabetes. Participants were randomly assigned a weekly dose of vitamin D3 of 25,000 IU (n = 45, mean age 73.10 ± 7.16 years) or nothing (n = 45, mean age 74.03 ± 7.64 years), in addition to suggested lifestyle measures. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory subscales (STAI-T and STAI-S) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression levels, respectively, at baseline, 6, and 12 months. 

A total of 

* 92.68% of the participants in the vitamin D group and 

* 97.14% of the controls exhibited vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) at baseline. 

Mean STAI-T scores were lower in supplemented individuals than in the control group at 6 (38.02 ± 9.03 vs. 43.91 ± 7.18, p = 0.003) and 12 months (32.35 ± 7.77 vs. 44.97 ± 7.78, p < 0.001). The same pattern was evident for STAI-S scores at 6 (37.11 ± 7.88 vs. 43.20 ± 9.33, p = 0.003) and 12 months (32.59 ± 6.45 vs. 44.60 ± 9.53, p < 0.001). Supplemented participants demonstrated lower mean PHQ-9 scores compared to controls at 6 (15.69 ± 6.15 vs. 19.77 ± 8.96, p = 0.021) and 12 months (13.52 ± 5.01 vs. 20.20 ± 8.67, p < 0.001). Participants with deficiency and insufficiency at baseline experienced equal benefits of supplementation in terms of anxiety and depression scores. 

 **In conclusion, in a high-risk population, a weekly vitamin D supplementation scheme was effective in alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms.**  More studies are needed to elucidate the relevant mechanisms.
