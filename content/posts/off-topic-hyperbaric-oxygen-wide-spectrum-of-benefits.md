 **Video and Transcript - and the follwoing highlights** 

* "There’s a wide range of conditions for which HBOT can be beneficial, including autoimmune conditions, neurological conditions, musculoskeletal injuries, mitochondrial dysfunction-driven conditions, ailments involving damaged microcirculation, chronic infections, subacute infections and cancer co-management"

* "While HBOT can speed healing of any inflammatory condition, in the U.S., there are only 14 conditions for which insurance will pay, one of which is diabetic neuropathy, and typically only after other conventional treatments have failed. There are over 100 internationally recognized indications for hyperbaric use"

* "There are two primary types of HBOT chambers: hard shell and soft shell. Hard-shell versions are available in two types — the kind you find in hospitals and the kind you typically find in private clinics or can purchase for home use."

* "Soft chambers are limited in terms of the pressure you can achieve. "In the U.S., you're only allowed to go to 1.3 atmospheres (ATA), which is about a relative 9 feet underwater. It's considered mild HBOT. It's about 4 to 4.25 pounds of force per square inch (psi)," Sonners says."

* "Still, it will allow you to absorb quite a bit more oxygen than you could normally, so it still offers very meaningful benefits. You may need to use it more frequently, and for longer duration though."

* "Sonners has also written a book, "Under Pressure: How One Unexpected Tool Is Revolutionizing Health," which you can preorder..."

#### [Hyperbaric Oxygen: A Spectrum of Emerging Treatments](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/2013/06/28/hyperbaric-oxygen-a-spectrum-of-emerging-treatments/%20) Scientific American June 2013

By Nathalie Sami and Janice Wong

Certified scuba divers are familiar with the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for decompression sickness treatment. However, in the past 50 years, researchers have revealed HBOT’s broad applications to human physiology and medicine. The outlook for HBOT applications for treating wounds, neurological diseases, and even certain cancers appears promising. What once seemed relevant only for scuba divers has now been discovered to benefit members of the general population.

### The health problems discussed

Wounds

Cholesterol Crystal Embolism (CCE)

Bone Healing

Surgery

Cancers

Breast and Prostate Cancer

Neurological Diseases

Vascular Diseases

Vascular Dementia

Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

Arterial gas embolisms and stroke

Insulin Sensitivity

## Clips from [WikiPedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine)

HBOT is recognized by Medicare in the US for 14 UHMS "approved" conditions.

U.S. physicians may lawfully prescribe HBOT for "off-label" conditions such as stroke, and migraine.

## [Dr. Dranton](http://drcranton.com/hbo.htm) has the following

 **MECHANISMS OF ACTION FOR BENEFIT OF HBOT** 

• Increased circulating of stem cells,

• Promotion of DNA transcription and DNA signaling,

• Increased messenger RNA,

• Increased expression of hormones and other proteins

• Increased anti-inflammatory hormones,

• Increased growth & repair genes and hormones,

• Up regulation of hormone receptors,

• down regulated inflammation,

• decreased cell death (apoptosis),

• angiogenesis (in growth of new blood vessels),

• epithelialization, increased epithelial formation of cells,

• enhanced bacterial killing by white blood cells,

• inhibition of bacterial toxin production,

• Increased healing,

• fibroblast proliferation,

• increased bone density,

• increased bone fracture healing,

• increased oxygen concentration in hypoxic or ischemic tissue.

The healing process may actually be caused by withdrawal from the intermittently elevated oxygen stimulus rather than from the oxygen itself – this is still unknown.

(Note by VitaminDWiki admin: My experiments with [Low Level Laser Therapy](http://www.henrylahore.com/Health/LLLT.html) around 2008 were similar; having the light turn on/off was far more important than total time on)

 **[Very long list of conditions treated](http://drcranton.com/hbo/conditions_treated.htm)** 

 **Seems like there is a significant overlap with the diseases prevented/treated by Vitamin D**

 **Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy gives people a level of Oxygen which nature cannot provide.** 

 **Wonder what would happen when people get to a level of vitamin D which nature cannot provide (excessive UVB to get hyperdose of vitamin D would greatly increase cancer)**

[The Most Overlooked, Effective Prescription Drug](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/most-overlooked-effective-prescription-drug-1) GreenMedical Information Sept 2013

Excellent review by a Dr. who used it for 4 years, and is now using normobaric oxygen

* The risk benefit ratio is more favorable by far than for any pill I can prescribe

* In my current practice, I treat ME or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (aka CFIDS or CFS), a neuroimmune illness with pathophysiological similarities to autism, Gulf War Illness, chronic Lyme Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.

* HBOT, no matter how useful, is difficult and expensive to access, though portable chambers are fairly cost effective over time and can be shared by families. High dose pulsed normobaric oxygen, while probably somewhat less effective over the short run than HBOT, can be continued long term and, for responders, the effects may be additive.
