#### Take Magnesium AND Vitamin D. To Avoid Vitamin D Side Effects

go to the original page to get the hyperlinks http://www.easy-immune-health.com/magnesium-and-vitamin-d.html

If you are taking Vitamin D, it's important that you understand the Magnesium and Vitamin D connection in order to avoid vitamin D side effects and maximize absorption.

Nutrients don't work alone, and when it comes to taking vitamin D, it's important that you take magnesium and vitamin D together and not JUST vitamin D alone in large doses as this can lead to what people BELIEVE are vitamin D side effects, but are really just magnesium deficiency symptoms that have been induced because of how vitamin d 'uses up' magnesium in its conversion to its 'active form' in the bloodstream from supplements and sunlight.

This is a BIG problem because as more and more people, and their doctors, begin to realize the amazing health benefits that Vitamin D has to offer and to understand the seriousness of the long-term Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency, more people are taking vitamin D with the effect of there being an increase in people having these so-called 'vitamin d side effects'.

But what is Not being addressed by health care practitioners, however, is that many of these 'Vitamin D Side Effects' are not problems with the vitamin d, but are problems with not getting enough magnesium! There would be a significant reduction in problems with taking vitamin D if only people would take magnesium and vitamin D were taken TOGETHER.

Part of this problem is that nearly as many people have undiagnosed magnesium deficiencies as do people with vitamin D deficiencies. And unfortunately, blood Magnesium Levels are virtually worthless, and can't tell you if you really are magnesium deficient!

In fact, Signs of Magnesium Deficiency are SO prevalent that Dr. Carolyn Dean calls this problem an 'Epidemic.' And if you have even a MILD unrecognized magnesium deficiency, your Signs of Magnesium Deficiency are going to be amplified greatly when vitamin d is taken- particularly in the large doses commonly used for vitamin d deficiency treatment. And this is creating some uncomfortable Side Effects of Vitamin D that are actually NOT problems with taking vitamin D itself, but symptoms of an induced magnesium deficiency!

Some of the problems being experienced by those taking vitamin D are:

* Headaches

* Insomnia

* Jitteriness

* Muscle Cramps

* Anxiety

* Heart Palpitations

* Constipation

 **All of which is exactly the same as Signs of Magnesium Deficiency!!** 

While certainly there are always going to be those who simply can't tolerate taking Vitamin D Supplements for one reason or another, the good news is that the vast majority of these problems can be cleared up or easily prevented by being sure to take magnesium, in a dosage that is outlined on the Magnesium Dosage page, along with your vitamin d. This is equally true of those who get their vitamin D from the sun as well.

#### Vitamin D Absorption Problems How Magnesium and Vitamin D Work Together

Since magnesium is required for the conversion of vitamin D into its active form, it's also true that taking vitamin D may not raise Vitamin D Blood Levels in those who are magnesium deficient!! Be sure that you read this again and understand this magnesium and vitamin D interrelationship:

* Magnesium is 'Used Up' when Vitamin D is converted into its active form in the blood

* Magnesium is 'Required' to convert Vitamin D into its active form in the blood

It works BOTH ways. Magnesium is not JUST depleted, but you won't convert vitamin D unless you have enough magnesium in order to allow vitamin D to BE converted!! In many cases where large doses of vitamin D are taken but the vitamin D level does not come up, both the person deficient and their doctor believe that they are having Vitamin D Absorption problems.

This ends up causing:

1) A lot of fear that an underlying serious medical problem exists

2) Unnecessarily high dosages of Vitamin D are often taken, causing worsening of the magnesium deficiency

3) Thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of dollars are spent in unnecessary medical testing to find the 'absorption' problem

4) The underlying magnesium deficiency is often never found and addressed because testing for magnesium levels is not a useful test to determine the need for that nutrient

Unlike drugs, nutrients are 'synergistic' and interconnected with each other.

Especially in the case of Magnesium and Vitamin D, it's EXTREMELY important that you take magnesium if you are taking vitamin D on a regular basis.

Another reason for this is that magnesium helps calcium absorption as well, and many women who take Vitamin D and Calcium 'For My Bones' don't end up taking magnesium along with these two nutrients- and this can impair the bone building effectiveness of the vitamin d and calcium.

So, don't get caught taking vitamin D without taking both magnesium and vitamin D together! It's really THAT important! Keep reading to find out what OTHER factors can affect vitamin D absorption...
