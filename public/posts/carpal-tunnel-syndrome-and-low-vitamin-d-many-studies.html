Although there are several etiologies, idiopathic is the most prevalent origin, and among the forms of treatment for CTS, conservative is the most indicated. However, despite the high prevalence in and impact of this syndrome on the healthcare system, there are still controversies regarding the best therapeutic approach for patients. Therefore, noting that some studies point to vitamin D deficiency as an independent risk factor, which increases the symptoms of the syndrome, this study evaluated the role of vitamin D supplementation and its influence on pain control, physical examination and response electroneuromyography to conservative treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. For this, the sample consisted of 14 patients diagnosed with CTS and hypovitaminosis D, who were allocated into two groups. The control group received corticosteroid treatment, while the experimental group received corticosteroid treatment associated with vitamin D. Thus, from this study, it can be concluded that patients who received vitamin D, when compared to those who did not receive it, showed improvement in the degree of pain intensity, a reduction in symptom severity and an improvement in some electroneuromyographic parameters.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-june-2024-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=cts-worse-if-low-vitamin-d-treated-by-vitamin-d-supplementation--may-2023>CTS worse if low vitamin D, treated by Vitamin D supplementation – May 2023</h4><p><strong>The role of Vitamin D in carpal tunnel syndrome risk and supplementation outcomes: A systematic review</strong></p><p>Curr Rheumatol Rev. 2023 May 5. <a href=https://doi.org/10.2174/1573397119666230505101443>doi: 10.2174/1573397119666230505101443</a> PDF is behind paywall</p><p>Shahin Asgari Savadjani 1, Catherine Mt Sherwin 2, Saeid Heidari-Soureshjani 3, Mohammad Darvishi 4, Mehdi Mohammadian Amiri 5</p><p>Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a debilitating neuropathy that accompanies pain and other physical limitations and disrupts the normal functioning of the victims&rsquo; lives.</p><p>Objective: We aimed to investigate Vitamin D&rsquo;s preventive and therapeutic effects on the occurrence and remission of CTS symptoms.</p><p>Methods: In this systematic review the PRISMA statement has been designed primarily.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of 25 (OH) D deficiency with electrophysiological findings and severity of pain in patients with mild CTS.</p><p>METHOD:</p><p>The consecutive patients admitted to our laboratory with the symptoms of CTS between May 2016 and August 2016 were enrolled in this study. According to their electrophysiological examination results, only the patients with normal conduction results and ones with mild grade CTS were included. Demographic data, the results of the electrophysiological studies, vitamin D levels (our laboratory normal is > 20 ng / mL), duration of pain and pain intensity due to CTS which was assessed with visual analog scale were collected.</p><p>RESULTS:</p><p>Totally, 76 patients (36 patients with mild CTS and 40 without CTS) were included. In the mild CTS patients, vitamin D levels were significantly lower than those electrophysiologically normal patients (p = 0.003). The relationship between gender, duration of pain and vitamin D levels were evaluated in the normal and mild CTS group. There was no significant relationship between the pain and vitamin D levels in the normal group, while <strong>vitamin D level was significantly lower in the mild CTS group</strong> (p = 0.730 and p = 0.002; respectively).</p><p>DISCUSSION:</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency increases the pain intensity in patients with CTS. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in these patients may play a role in pain relief. Further studies involving analyses of post-Vitamin D replacement therapy are warranted to confirm the association between vitamin D deficiency and pain due to CTS.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/cts-2017.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><p><strong>Note that CTS pain decreases with increased Vitamin D</strong></p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/cts-pain.jpg alt=image><hr><h4 id=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-triggered-by-low-vitamin-d---march-2016>Carpal tunnel syndrome triggered by low vitamin D - March 2016</h4><p><strong>Does vitamin D deficiency trigger carpal tunnel syndrome?</strong></p><p>J Back Musculoskelet Rehabil. 2016 Mar 31.</p><p>Tanik N1, Balbaloğlu Ö2, Ucar M2, Sarp U3, Atalay T4, Çelikbilek A1, Göçmen AY5, Inan LE1.</p><p>1Department of Neurology, Bozok University Medical School, Yozgat, Turkey.</p><p>2Department of Physical Treatment and Rehabilitation, Bozok University Medical School, Yozgat, Turkey.</p><p>3Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Yozgat State Hospital, Yozgat, Turkey.</p><p>4Department of Neurosurgery, Bozok University Medical School, Yozgat, Turkey.</p><p>5Department of Biochemistry, Bozok University Medical School, Yozgat, Turkey.</p><p>OBJECTIVE:</p><p>Vitamin D deficiencies are associated with a variety of chronic diseases.

All patients underwent nerve conduction studies and completed Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BQ) symptom severity and functional status scales to quantify symptom severity, pain status and functional status. There were 57 patients with electrophysiological confirmed CTS (EP+ group) and 51 electrophysiological negative symptomatic patients (EP− group). 25(OH) D deficiency (25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/ml) was found in 96.1 % of EP− group, in 94.7 % of EP+ group and in 73.8 % of control group. 25(0H) D level was found significantly lower both in EP+ and EP− groups compared to control group (p = 0.006, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Although mean vitamin D level in EP− group was lower than EP+ group, statistically difference was not significant between EP+ and EP− groups (p = 0.182). BQ symptom severity and functional status scores and BQ pain sum score were not significantly different between EP+ and EP− groups. We found no correlation with 25(OH) D level for BQ symptom severity, functional status and pain sum scores. 25(OH) D deficiency is a common problem in patients with CTS symptoms. As evidenced by the present study, assessment of serum 25(OH)D is recommended in CTS patients even with electrophysiological negative results.</p><p><strong>References are online, free</strong></p><p><strong>95% of people with CTS had Vitamin D &lt;20 ng (vs 74% of people without CTS)</strong></p><hr><h4 id=somewhat-better-recovery-from-ct-surgery-if-take-a-paltry-1000-iu-of-vitamin-d-daily---april-2019>Somewhat better recovery from CT Surgery if take a paltry 1,000 IU of Vitamin D daily - April 2019</h4><p><strong>The Effect of Vitamin D Deficiency Correction on the Outcomes in Women After Carpal Tunnel Release</strong></p><p>The Journal of Hand Surgery. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2019.03.008>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2019.03.008</a></p><p>Purpose</p><p>Studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation improves myelination and recovery after nerve injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether correction of vitamin D level leads to better surgical outcomes in women with both carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and vitamin D deficiency.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We retrospectively reviewed 84 vitamin D–deficient women with CTS who underwent carpal tunnel release and then received daily vitamin D supplementation of <strong>1,000 IU vitamin D for 6 months</strong> . We also reviewed 35 control patients who were vitamin D–nondeficient at baseline and thus did not receive the supplementation. At baseline and 6 months after surgery, we measured serum vitamin D levels, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, motor conduction velocity, and grip and pinch strengths. We compared the outcomes of CTS related to vitamin D levels. We also correlated baseline and follow-up vitamin D levels with the assessed parameters.</p><p>Results</p><p>At 6 months, 59 patients became vitamin D–nondeficient (≥ 20 ng/mL) and 25 were still vitamin D–deficient (&lt; 20 ng/mL). Patients who became vitamin D–nondeficient had subtle but better DASH scores than patients who were still vitamin D–deficient or the control patients. Vitamin D levels at 6 months were found to have significant correlation with the DASH score at 6 months. Vitamin D levels at 6 months did not have significant correlation with motor conduction velocity or grip and pinch strengths.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Women with CTS and vitamin D deficiency showed subtle but better DASH scores after surgery when vitamin D deficiency was corrected by supplementation.</p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/autoimmune.html><span class=tag>autoimmune</span></a>
