 **Compliance = take at least 4 out of 7 days** 

 **Note: Study did not even consider the increased compliance from** 

1. Less frequent dosing

1. Starting with a loading dose so the benefits can be felt in days instead of months

1. Recommending that could take missed pills in a single day

> Example - put 30 pills in a cup at the beginning of each month and just be sure that there are none at the end of the month

1. Not really have to swallow pills - alternately use liquid, powder, topical, inhaled, etc,
