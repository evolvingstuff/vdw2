1. [Download](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6QlVt2c5Ow) a copy of the script  (closed captions) in English

> Below the video, select TRANSCRIPT, then select ALL (typically cntrl-A), then COPY (cntrl-C), 

> then PASTE (cntrl-V) into a word processing program

> The start of the transcript section should look like

> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color:#00F;">0:00Have you ever wondered why we are seeing</span>

> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color:#00F;">0:02dramatic increases in health problems</span>

> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="color:#00F;">0:04since our great-grandparents time?</span>

> &nbsp;

1. Download a copy of closed captions with Google translation of the target language

> &nbsp; similar to above, but after select TRANSCRIPT you select the LANGUAGE

> &nbsp; 

1. Re-do the Google translation to make the script you wish to record onto the video

> &nbsp;

1. Download a copy of the video using [any of the many services, browser add-ons, or programs which you can download to your computer](https://www.google.com/search?num=20&q=download+youtube+videos+top+free&oq=download+youtube+videos+top+free&gs_l=serp.3..0i22i30l10.13058.15349.0.18088.9.8.0.1.1.0.167.725.7j1.8.0....0...1c.1.43.serp..0.9.736.TgDr_yOaMAc)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Or just download a copy from [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/92747342)

> &nbsp;

1. Practice doing a voice-over while watching the video with closed captions in English or target language

> Notice the points in the video where voice-over takes too long in your language

> &nbsp;

1. Load the video into video editing software 

> [Microsoft Movie Maker](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker#t1=overview) or other free ones [1](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/software/applications/best-free-video-editing-software-9-top-programs-you-should-download-1136264), [2](http://www.akascope.com/2011/07/15/free-video-editing-software/), and [3 which appears that the software is online](http://www.webhostingreviewboard.com/development/top-10-free-online-video-editors-for-editing-making-videos-online/)

> &nbsp;

1. Play the video while recording your voice

> Play it back and make corrections and perhaps freeze frame the video or slow the video to extend time needed (10% slower seems to work)

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Most software will you allow to re-do just a small portion, rather than the entire 5 minutes)

> &nbsp;

1. Upload to a video sharing site such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

> OR Video creators  at [Ample Earth](http://ampleearth.com/) can upload it for you if you wish. 

> Send your video to  <span>[Harry@AmpleEarth.com]</span> via  [http://www.wetransfer.com](http://www.wetransfer.com), or just a link to your video on the web.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will check that the voice-over sounds good and keeps to the script before linking to it on VitaminDWiki

> 

>  **Update May 20 - as a possibility instead of steps 6 & 7 & 8** 

> It may be possible for you to just record an MP3 file which we would then intergrate with the video

> The possibly tricky part is the synchronization of the audio with the video.

> If you can be sure that your voice rarely extends into the next scene there should not be a problem."
