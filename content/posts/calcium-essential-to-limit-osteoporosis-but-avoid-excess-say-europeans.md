#### Calcium in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis: EMAS clinical guide

 **Summary from PDF** 

* An adequate intake of calcium as a mainstay in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis remains a universal recommendation in guidelines.

* It is important to get an assessment, even approximate, of the individual’s intake of calcium. 

> Supplementation may be recommended, where levels are or seem to be insufficient.

* Women should be warned that calcium intakes above the recommended levels may be useless, 

>  **or may even entail some harm** , though this remains uncertain.

* Dietary interventions may be advantageous, but this also  **lacks strong evidence and is not universally agreed.** 

* Women who do not wish to take supplements and who have problems in maintaining a diet sufficiently rich in calcium should be reassured that this is  **unlikely to affect adversely their fracture risk** .Other measures, like physical activity and vitamin D supplements may help to maintain bone health.

 **Also clipped from PDF** 

* " The possibility that repeated calcium peaks have deleterious health effects has some experimental support <sup>[27]</sup>. To  reduce this effect, a maximum of 500 mg of elemental calcium is recommended per dose"

* "Furthermore, a recent expert consensus meeting of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) and the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) concluded that  **supplementation with calcium alone for fracture reduction is not supported by current evidence**
