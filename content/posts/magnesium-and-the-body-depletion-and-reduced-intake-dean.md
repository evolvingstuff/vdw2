### Dr. Carolyn Dean posted an article: Magnesium Burn Rate

#### Magnesium depleted by:

1. Athletic performance causes sweat loss of magnesium.

1. Alcohol causes magnesium depletion due to its diuretic effect.

1. Acid rain is high in nitric acid, which draws calcium and magnesium out of the soil to try and neutralize the acid- ity and consequently depletes the soil of these minerals.

1. Caffeine causes magnesium depletion with its diuretic effect. It also stimulates the adrenal glands, causing adrenaline surges and magnesium loss.

1. Most drugs cause magnesium depletion; this is especially true of drugs containing fluorine atoms such as Lipitor, Prozac, and Ciprofloxacin <span>[Cipro]</span>.

1. Herbicides such as Roundup bind with magnesium, making it unavailable for plants to utilize for decades.

1. Junk foods, especially sugar products, drain magnesium. The liver needs twenty-eight atoms of magnesium to process one molecule of glucose. Fructose requires fifty- six atoms of magnesium.

1. Low potassium levels can increase urinary magnesium loss.

1. High-protein diets can decrease magnesium absorption and require more magnesium for digestion and assimilation.

1. Sauna therapy for weight loss, to detox, or just to stay healthy can cause enough mineral loss through sweating to create magnesium deficiency symptoms.

1. Tannins in tea bind and remove minerals, including magnesium.

1. Trans fatty acids and mineral deficiency alter cell wall integrity, making the cell walls more rigid, which affects receptor site function and prevents the flow of nutrients in or out of cells.

#### Magnesium reduced intake (some of which are in the past few decades)

1. Antacids counteract stomach acid, decreasing magnesium absorption.

1. Fertilizers do not replace necessary minerals but are high in phosphorous, potassium, and nitrogen. Excess potassium and phosphorus are preferentially absorbed into plants, inhibiting magnesium absorption.

1. Fluoride and fluorine in water, from dental procedures, in toothpaste, and in drugs bind magnesium, making it unavailable to the body. Magnesium fluoride (MgF2), called sellaite, is an insoluble compound and replaces magnesium in bone and cartilage with a brittle, unstable crystalline substance.

1. Food processing and cooking decrease magnesium levels.

1. Pesticides kill worms and bacteria and thus their function of processing the soil and breaking down minerals is lost, which means fewer minerals are absorbed by plants.

1. Intestinal disease, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), leaky gut, gluten and casein sensitivities, funguses, and parasites, interferes with magnesium absorption.

1. Meat from animals eating magnesium-depleted food is low in magnesium.

1. Oxalic acid (found in rhubarb, spinach, and chard) and phytic acid (found in cereal grains and soy) block absorption of magnesium.

1. Refining grains, especially rice and wheat, reduces magnesium.

1. Soil on farmland is woefully depleted of magnesium.

1. Soil erosion makes it easier for heavy rain or irrigation to wash away soil, leading to a loss of minerals, including magnesium.

1. Stress or trauma of any type—physical, mental, emotional, environmental—can cause magnesium deficiency.

1. Stomach acid deficiency due to stress results in decreased absorption of magnesium.

1. Water softening treatment reduces magnesium.
