**[Hartford Hospital Study: Pepcid, a Heartburn Medication, Helped Some COVID-19 Patients](https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleid=28305&publicId=395#.X5L7M1WcMmk.twitter) Sept 2, 2020** 

Pepcid = calcium carbonate +famotidine+  **magnesium**  hydroxide

Apparently famotidine blocks Magnesium, so Pepcid adds Magnesium

Magnesium is essential to process Vitamin D in 8 stages (see below)

Suspect that people would have a similar COVID-19 benefit by just taking Magnesium

&nbsp; &nbsp; Oral, injection, topical,. . . 

And an even more benefit by taking Vitamin D

 **Antacids** 

* "Most antacids contain at least one of these key ingredients: calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide and/or sodium bicarbonate. "

 **[Zinc (which increases vitamin D in tissues) may both prevent and treat COVID-19](/posts/zinc-which-increases-vitamin-d-in-tissues-may-both-prevent-and-treat-covid-19)** 

* "Antacids that contain both magnesium and aluminum — like Maalox and Mylanta — are less likely to cause diarrhea or constipation than products containing just magnesium or aluminum, since the effects of these two ingredients tend to balance each other out."
