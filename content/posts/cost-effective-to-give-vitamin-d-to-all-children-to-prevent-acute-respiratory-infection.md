#### Cost-utility of vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections in children

Cost Eff Resour Alloc. 2023 Apr 6;21(1):23. [doi: 10.1186/s12962-023-00433-z.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12962-023-00433-z.)

Introduction: Increasing evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections in children. More economic evaluations incorporating the new evidence and in the pediatric population are needed to know the efficiency of this treatment. This study aimed to determine the cost-utility of vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory infections in pediatric patients.

Methods: A decision tree model was used to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of vitamin D supplementation in healthy school children between 1 and 16 years. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) value of $19,000.

Results: The base-case analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation was associated with lower costs and higher QALYs than strategy without this supplementation. The QALYs per person estimated in the model for those treatments were 0,99 with vitamin D supplementation and 0,98 without vitamin D supplementation. The total costs per person were US$ 1354 for vitamin D supplementation and US$ 1948 without vitamin D supplementation. This position of absolute dominance of vitamin D supplementation makes it unnecessary to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

Conclusion: In conclusion, our study shows that Vitamin D supplementation is a cost-effective strategy to prevent ARI in pediatric patients, from a societal perspective.
