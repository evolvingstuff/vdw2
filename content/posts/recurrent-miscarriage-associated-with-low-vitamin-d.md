STUDY QUESTION Do women with recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) and low vitamin D have increased prevalence of auto- and cellular immune abnormalities when compared with women with RPL who have normal vitamin D, and does vitamin D have any effect on cellular immunity in vitro?

SUMMARY ANSWER A high proportion of women with RPL have vitamin D deficiency and the risk of auto- and cellular immune abnormalities is increased in women with RPL and vitamin D deficiency.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Vitamin D deﬁciency in pregnant women is associated with increased risk of obstetrical complications such as pre-eclampsia, bacterial vaginosis associated preterm delivery, gestational diabetes mellitus and small-for-gestational age births.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A retrospective cross-sectional study of 133 women with RPL who were enrolled in a 2-year period, together with laboratory experiments.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS  **Women with three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions**  prior to 20 weeks of gestation who were enrolled at the University clinic. Serum vitamin D level, cellular activity and autoimmune parameters in vivo and in vitro were measured.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Sixty-three out of 133 women (47.4%) had low vitamin D (<30 ng/ml). The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibody (APA) was significantly higher in low vitamin D group (VDlow) (39.7%) than in the normal vitamin D group (VDnl) (22.9%) (P< 0.05) and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for APA in VDlow was 2.22 with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.0–4.7. The prevalence of antinuclear antigen antibody (VDlow versus VDnl; 23.8% versus 10.0%, OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.1–7.4), anti-ssDNA (19.0% versus 5.7%, OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.1–12.4) and thyroperoxidase antibody (33.3% versus 15.7%, OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.2–6.1) was significantly higher in VDlow than those of VDnl (P < 0.05 each). Peripheral blood CD19+ B and CD56+ NK cell levels and NK cytotoxicity at effector to target cell (E:T) ratio of 25:1 were significantly higher in VDlow when compared with those of VDnl (P < 0.05 each). Reduction (%) of NK cytotoxicity (at E:T ratio of 50:1 and 25:1) by IgG (12.5 mg/dl) was significantly lower in VDlow than those of VDnl (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). There were no differences in Th1/Th2 ratios between VDlow and VDnl. When vitamin D3 was added in NK cytotoxicity assay in vitro, NK cytotoxicity at E:T ratio of 50:1 was significantly suppressed with 10 nMol/L (nM) (11.9 ± 3.3%) and 100 nM (10.9 ± 3.7%) of vitamin D3 when compared with controls (15.3 ± 4.7%) (P < 0.01 each). TNF-α/IL-10 expressing CD3+/4+ cell ratios were significantly decreased with 100 nM of vitamin D3 (31.3 ± 9.4, P < 0.05) when compared with controls (40.4 ± 11.3) in vitro. Additionally, INF-γ/IL-10 expressing CD3+/4+ cell ratio was significantly decreased with 100 nM of vitamin D3 (12.1 ± 4.0, P < 0.05) when compared with controls (14.8 ± 4.6). IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion from NK cells were significantly decreased (P < 0.01 each), and IL-10, IL-1β, vascular endothelial growth factor and granulocyte colony stimulating factor levels were significantly increased (P < 0.01 each) with vitamin D3 100 nM when compared with those of controls.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in women with RPL in this study is open to a possible type I error since women with vitamin D supplementation were excluded from this study.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Assessment of vitamin D level is recommended in women with RPL. Vitamin D supplementation should be explored further as a possible therapeutic option for RPL.
