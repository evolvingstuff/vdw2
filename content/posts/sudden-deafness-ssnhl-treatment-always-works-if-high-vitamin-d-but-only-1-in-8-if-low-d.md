Background

Due to high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the possible association with Sudden Sensory-Neural Hearing Loss (SSNHL) finding the main causes and appropriate treatments are highly essential. This study aimed to investigate vitamin D levels in patients suffering SSNHL and its effect on response to treatment.

Materials and methods

This cross-sectional study was performed on two groups of case (34 SSNHL patients) and control (34 healthy subjects without risk of hearing loss). All patient information such as age, sex, audiogram illustration of hearing frequency and the level of vitamin D were recorded at baseline. Patients with SSNHL received routine treatments such as 10 days of 1 mg/kg/day steroid and the response or lack of complete response to treatment was recorded and analyzed according to the audiometry.

Results

Vitamin D level in SSNHL group with a mean of 19.28 ± 9.56 ng/ml was significantly less than the control group (25.71 ± 11.21 ng/ml; P value < 0.001). After treatment, 76.5% were completely recovered and 23.5% did not recover completely. Factors such as age, sex and level of initial hearing loss did not have a significant effect on the response to treatment, but the level of vitamin D in these patients had a significant relationship with the response to treatment (P value = 0.004); so that  **all patients with sufficient vitamin D level had completely recovered, versus 87.5% of patients with vitamin D deficiency and 12.5% of insufficient vitamin D had no response to treatment.** 

Conclusion

According to the results of the present study, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with SSNHL was more than healthy people. SSNHL patients with deficient vitamin D had the highest percentage of no response

* “The current standard treatment for sudden hearing loss is a tapered course of oral high-dose corticosteroids to increase circulation to the inner ear”

* “Estimates of incidence typically range from 2 to 20 per 100,000 people per year <span>[1-3]</span>. SSNHL can occur at any age but most commonly affects patients 43 to 53 years of age”
