#### Vitamin D is associated with visual memory in young northern adolescents

Background: Vitamin D status has been linked to visual memory in adults. We hypothesized a similar association in young adolescents.

Methods: Participants were 9-13 years. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Task (ROCF), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), Digit Span (Forward, Backward), and verbal fluency task assessed visual and verbal learning/memory, attention/working memory, and executive functioning/language, respectively.  **An at-home, mail-in blood spot test assessed 25(OH)D levels** .

Results: Participants (N = 56) were 10.7 ± 1.3 years, 61% females, 25(OH)D levels 84.2 ± 25 nmol/L(39.9 - 167.2 nmol/L) and 41% had insufficient vitamin D status (<75 nmol/L). 

Only measures of visual memory (ROCF-Recall, -%Recall of Copy) were significantly correlated with 25(OH)D, r = .34, p < .01 and r = .33, p < .01, respectively, and 25(OH)D remained a significant independent predictor on multiple regression analyses, which included age and sex.(ROCF-Recall overall model: Adj R2 = .24, p < .001; for 25(OH)D: p = .009; ROCF-%Recall of Copy overall model: Adj R2 = .20 p < .002; for 25(OH)D: p = .01). Individuals with sufficient vitamin D performed significantly better only on these measures (t-tests; ROCF-Recall, p = .016, d = 0.68; ROCF-%Recall of Copy, p = .022, d = 0.64). Despite moderate effect sizes (d = 0.4-0.5) in the Younger Age Group (9-10 years), only in the Older Age Group (11-13 years) was 25(OH)D significantly correlated with ROCF-Recall, r = .64, p = .0001 and ROCF-%Recall of Copy, r = .64, p = .0001, as well as working memory (Digit Span-Backward), Spearman's r = .46, p = .013. Similarly, those in the Older Age Group with sufficient vitamin D performed significantly better on ROCF-Recall, p = .01, d = 1.07; and ROCF-%Recall of Copy, p = .009, d = 1.08.

Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency was common in young adolescents.  **Similar to adults, visual memory was better among participants with higher 25(OH)D**  and those with sufficient levels. This effect was especially pronounced among older participants, suggesting possible time- and/or age-related implications of vitamin D status on cognition.
