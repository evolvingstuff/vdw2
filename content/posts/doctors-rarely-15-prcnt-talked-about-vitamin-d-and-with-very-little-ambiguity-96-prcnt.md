&nbsp; &nbsp;  **<span style="color:#00F;">so only 6% of CAM visits discussed vitamin D and the immune system ( 15% X 40%)</span>** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  **but NONE of the conventional doctors vitamin D and the immune system** 

BACKGROUND: Little is known about how providers communicate recommendations when scientific uncertainty exists.

OBJECTIVES: To compare provider recommendations to those in the scientific literature, with a focus on whether uncertainty was communicated.

DESIGN: Qualitative (inductive systematic content analysis) and quantitative analysis of previously collected audio-recorded provider-patient office visits.

PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-one providers and a socio-economically diverse convenience sample of 603 of their patients from outpatient community- and academic-based primary care, integrative medicine, and complementary and alternative medicine provider offices in Southern California.

MAIN MEASURES:

Comparison of provider information-giving about vitamin D to professional guidelines and scientific information for which conflicting recommendations or insufficient scientific evidence exists; certainty with which information was conveyed.

RESULTS:

Ninety-two ( **15.3 %** ) of 603 visit discussions touched upon issues related to vitamin D testing, management and benefits. 

* Vitamin D deficiency screening was discussed with 23 (25 %) patients, the 

* definition of vitamin D deficiency with 21 (22.8 %), the 

* optimal range for vitamin D levels with 26 (28.3 %), 

* vitamin D supplementation dosing with 50 (54.3 %), and 

* benefits of supplementation with 46 (50 %). 

For each of the professional guidelines/scientific information examined, providers conveyed information that deviated from professional guidelines and the existing scientific evidence. Of 166 statements made about vitamin D in this study, providers conveyed 160 ( **96.4 %) with certainty** , without mention of any equivocal or contradictory evidence in the scientific literature. No uncertainty was mentioned when vitamin D dosing was discussed, even when recommended dosing was higher than guideline recommendations.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

Providers convey the vast majority of information and recommendations about vitamin D with certainty, even though the scientific literature contains inconsistent recommendations and declarations of inadequate evidence. Not communicating uncertainty blurs the contrast between evidence-based recommendations and those without evidence. Providers should explore best practices for involving patients in decision-making by acknowledging the uncertainty behind their recommendations.
