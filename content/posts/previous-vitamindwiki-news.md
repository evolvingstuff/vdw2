## Notes by Henry Lahore on Vitamin D Workshop June 2013,

* 3-epi-25 hydroxyvitamin D form may make up 20 ng of vitamin d in infants < 1 year old

> Not known what 3-ep1 form does. Some testers (Mass spec) include it, some ignore it.

* Decrease of vitamin D with time: probably linear rather than exponential

* 200 IU recommendation by WHO and intravenous feeding are both very out of date

* How much vitamin D can the body process per day: some feel 10,000, others feel 50,000

* The study which found sun last longer than supplements might have been for D2, not D3

* Wonder how soon till infant/fetus is able to convert vitamin D into what the body can use ?

* Some preemies need supplementation with active form of vitamin D  –

* Magnesium – yes, this orphan element might be a source of problems with vitamin D

* Magneiusm bio-availability unclear

* Epigenetics, twin study Vietnam  perhaps 65% vitamin D variation is inherited

* What happens when vitamin D is not taken daily – is something activated to decrease level

* Might seniors need vitamin D more frequently than weekly?

* Vitamin D should provide a great return on investment in Workplace Wellness

* Pharacists like to sell Vitamin D3 instead of D2 – far more profit

* Hypothesis: evolution would have arrived at > 50 ng of vitamin D  if not had pesky skin cancer

* Alzheimer's increase from 1% to 7% of Japanese adjusted for the same age, but there no concurrent increase in % of vascular cognitive decline! 

* To be effective need 2mg of sunscreen per square cm = about 1 tube per application

* Why do meat eaters seem to have higher level of vitamin D than vegetarians?
