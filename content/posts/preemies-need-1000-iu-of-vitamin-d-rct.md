 **Highlights** 

* There is no consensus regarding the adequate dose of supplementation for preterm infants.

* Vitamin D supplementation of 1000 IU/d in very preterm infants effectively decreases the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

* The clinical importance of biochemically sufficient levels of vitamin D need to be further assessed.

Background

Preterm newborns are born with lower vitamin D stores. Although vitamin D supplementation is recommended there is no consensus regarding the adequate dose of supplementation for preterm infants.

Aims

To assess the effect of three different doses of vitamin D supplementation (400, 800 and 1000 IU/d) in preterm infants ≤ 32 weeks gestation on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and 25(OH) D levels at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).

Study design: Prospective randomized trial.

Subjects: 121 preterm infants with gestational age of 24–32 weeks were randomly allocated to receive 400, 800 or 1000 IU/d vitamin D.

Outcome measures

Serum concentration of 25(OH) D and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency at 36 weeks PMA. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH) D concentrations < 20 ng/ml.

Results

Of the 121 infants 72% had deficient vitamin D levels before supplementation. The average 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations at 36 weeks PMA were significantly higher in 800 IU (40 ± 21.4 ng/ml) and 1000 IU group (43 ± 18.9 ng/ml) when compared to 400 IU group (29.4 ± 13 ng/ml). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (2.5 vs 22.5; RR: 0.09; CI:0.01–0.74) and insufficiency (30 vs 57.5; RR:0.32; CI:0.13–0.80) was significantly lower in 1000 IU group when compared to 400 IU group at 36 weeks PMA.

Conclusion

1000 IU/d of vitamin D supplementation in preterm infants ≤ 32 weeks gestation age effectively decreases the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and leads to higher concentrations of 25(OH) vitamin D at 36 weeks PMA

Trial registration Clinical Trials.gov: NCT02941185.
