The aging process affects all organs, including the kidneys. As part of this process, progressive scarring and a measurable decline in renal function occur in most people over time. The improved understanding of the processes that can lead to and/or hasten scarring and loss of renal function over time parallels advances in our understanding of the aging process. Clinical factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, abnormal lipid levels and vitamin D deficiency, have been associated with increasing renal sclerosis with age. In addition, tissue factors such as angiotensin II, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress and Klotho are associated with renal aging. These associations and possible interventions, including the control of blood pressure, blood sugar, weight, diet and calorie restriction might make renal aging more preventable than inevitable.
