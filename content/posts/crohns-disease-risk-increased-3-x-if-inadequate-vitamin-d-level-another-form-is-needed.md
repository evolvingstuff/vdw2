We determined the association between vitamin D status as 25hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and disease activity in a cohort of 201 Crohn’s Disease (CD) patients in Saskatoon, Canada over three years. The association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and 25(OH)D and several disease predictors were evaluated by the generalized estimating equation (GEE) over three time-point measurements. A GEE binary logistic regression test was used to evaluate the association between vitamin D status and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). The deficient vitamin D group (≤29 nmol/L) had significantly higher mean hs-CRP levels compared with the three other categories of vitamin D status (p < 0.05). CRP was significantly lower in all of the other groups compared with the vitamin D-deficient group, which had Coef. = 12.8 units lower (95% CI −19.8, −5.8), Coef. 7.85 units (95% CI −14.9, −0.7), Coef. 9.87 units (95% CI −17.6, −2.0) for the vitamin D insufficient, adequate, and optimal groups, respectively. The vitamin D status was associated with the HBI active disease category. 

However, the difference in the odds ratio compared with the reference category of deficient vitamin D category was only significant in the insufficient category ( **odds ratio = 3.45** , p = 0.03, 95% CI 1.0, 10.8). Vitamin D status was inversely associated with indicators of disease activity in Crohn’s disease, particularly with the objective measures of inflammation.
