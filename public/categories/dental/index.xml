&lt;p>In a randomized controlled trial, a daily Oral Vitamin D supplementation was given in dose of 2000 IU for Group A, 1000 IU for Group B , 500 IU for Group C and placebo for Group D over 3 months period to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin D on gingivitis at various doses. The changes in gingival scores were measured at the period of 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd month.

&lt;p>MATERIAL AND METHODS:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Subjects comprised 406 female subjects (55-74 years old) who agreed to participate in a baseline examination and a follow-up examination after 5 years. Serum cystatin C levels were used to assess renal function. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between tooth loss and change in serum cystatin C levels over 5 years. Tooth loss over 5 years (0: no, 1: yes) was used as the dependent variable. Seven variables were used as independent variables, including change in serum cystatin C levels over 5 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dental caries cut in half by vitamin D, review of 24 old clinical trials</title><link>/posts/dental-caries-cut-in-half-by-vitamin-d-review-of-24-old-clinical-trials.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dental-caries-cut-in-half-by-vitamin-d-review-of-24-old-clinical-trials.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-and-dental-caries-in-controlled-clinical-trials-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis">Vitamin D and dental caries in controlled clinical trials: systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/h4>

Background: Maternal periodontal disease is found in ?40% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. 

Vitamin D deficiency may play a role in periodontal disease and tooth loss, and insufficient vitamin D status is common among pregnant women. 

The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between maternal vitamin D status and periodontal disease. 

Methods: A case-control study was conducted. Cases were defined as pregnant women with clinical moderate to severe periodontal disease; controls were pregnant women who were periodontally healthy. Maternal data were chart abstracted and serum was collected between 14 and 26 weeks of gestation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[OH]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;D) levels were measured using liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Median serum 25(OH)D levels and prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (defined as &amp;lt;75 nmol/l) were compared between cases and controls. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for moderate to severe periodontal disease among women with vitamin D insufficiency was calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for maternal race, season of blood draw, and other potential confounders. 

Results: A total of 117 cases were compared to 118 controls. 

Cases had lower median 25(OH)D levels than controls (59 versus 100 nmol/l; P &amp;lt;0.001) and were more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency (65% versus 29%; P &amp;lt;0.001). 

The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for moderate to severe periodontal disease among women with vitamin D insufficiency was **2.1** (0.99 to 4.5). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;[OH]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;D &amp;lt;75 nmol/l) is associated with maternal periodontal disease during pregnancy. Vitamin D

&lt;p>I have a lot of admiration for Drs. Edward and May Mellanby. A husband-and-wife team, **** they discovered vitamin D, and determined that rickets is caused by poor calcium (or phosphorus) status, typically due to vitamin D deficiency. They believed that an ideal diet is omnivorous, based on whole foods, and offers an adequate supply of fat-soluble vitamins and easily absorbed minerals. They also felt that grain intake should be modest, as their research showed that unsoaked whole grains antagonize the effect of vitamins D and A.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
