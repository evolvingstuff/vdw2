Background: In 2013, the group of Cicero Coimbra, Brazil, reported the clinical efficacy of high doses of vitamin D3 in patients suffering from autoimmune skin disorders (“Coimbra protocol”, CP). However, hypercalcemia and the subsequent impaired renal function may be major concerns raised against this protocol. 

Methods: We report for the first time for a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases in 319 patients (mean age (±SD) 43.3 ± 14.6 years, 65.5% female, 34.5% male) safety data for high doses of orally applied vitamin D3 (treatment period: up to 3.5 years) accompanied by a strict low-calcium diet and regular daily fluid intake of at least 2.5 L. 

Results: Mean vitamin D3 dose was 35,291 ± 21,791 IU per day. The measurement of more than 6100 single relevant laboratory parameters showed all mean values (±SD) within the normal range for total serum calcium (2.4 ± 0.1 mmol/L), serum creatinine (0.8 ± 0.2 mg/dL), serum creatinine associated estimated GFR (92.5 ± 17.3 mL/min), serum cystatin C (0.88 ± 0.19 mg/L), serum TSH (1.8 ± 1 mIU/L), and for 24 h urinary calcium secretion (6.9 ± 3.3 mmol/24 h). We found a very weak relationship between the dosage of oral vitamin D3 and the subsequent calcium levels, both in serum and in urinary excretion over 24 h, respectively. 

Conclusions: Our data show the reliable safety of the CP in autoimmune patients under appropriate supervision by experienced physicians.

75% had mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 

74% has 4+ mutations in nine different genes 

5% had mutations in all genes investigated

#### Coimbra protocol appears to have not tried 8+ things

1. Infrequent dosing, perhaps once every 3 days - a good way to get past the VDR

1. Activation of Vitamin D receptors by Resveratrol and 14 other methods

1. Glutathione etc, which activate many vitamin D genes

1. Other forms of Vitamin D – which are more bioavailable – especially if poor gut

1. The use of probiotics to improve the gut microbiome

1. Water-soluble Vitamin D, Omega-3 - so that fat is not required concurrently 

1. Loading dose to speedup the treatment by several months

1. Plant-based Calcium for those who must have Calcium
