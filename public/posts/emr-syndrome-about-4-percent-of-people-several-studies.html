We have recently extended and confirmed our previous observation showing that EHS and MCS share clinically identical symptoms and may co-exist as a unique, common, sensitivity-related neurologic syndrome in 25% of the cases. There is presently no published biological study of these disorders, except the one we have previously published as preliminary. In the present study, we show that EHS and MCS and the combined syndrome share identical biochemical changes. More precisely, by measuring levels of peripheral blood and urine molecular biomarkers in a cohort of 2,018 consecutive cases, we show that both disorders and the combined syndrome can be objectively characterized, in about 90% of the cases, by a decrease in the production of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate in urine, while in 30-50% they are characterized by increased levels of histamine and of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and/or 70, and of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine in the peripheral blood. Increased levels of histamine and HSP are indicators of low grade inflammation while increased levels of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine are indicators of blood-brain barrier disruption/opening. In addition, we show that in about 15% of the cases anti-myelin autoantibodies can be detected in the peripheral blood, accounting for the occurrence of an autoimmune response. Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the biochemical tests are discussed, as well as the role of these indicators used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. We also discuss cases with undetectable biological change for which they can be nevertheless diagnosed by cerebral neurotransmitters analysis in urine and brain imaging. On the basis of these biological data it is suggested that EHS and/or MCS are new brain disorders, generated via a common etiopathogenic mechanism.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/molecular-biomarkers-in-electrohypersensitivity.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=3-to-7-of-people-have-electromagnetic-hypersensitivity>3% to 7% of people have Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity</h4><p><strong>Prevalence of Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Comprehensive Analysis</strong></p><p><strong><a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/approximately-what-of-the-popu-yPBLZC8gT1.py1YCPHGx.g>Perplexity AI - Deep Research April 2025</a></strong></p><p>The prevalence of electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) and related conditions varies significantly across populations, studies, and terminology.

#### Hypersensitivity to man-made electromagnetic fields (EHS) correlates with immune responsivity to oxidative stress: a case report - Aug 2024

There is increasing evidence that exposure to weak electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by modern telecommunications or household appliances has physiological consequences, including reports of electromagnetic field hypersensitivity (EHS) leading to adverse health effects. Although symptoms can be serious, no underlying mechanism for EHS is known and there is no general cure or effective therapy. Here, we present the case study of a self-reported EHS patient whose symptoms include severe headaches, generalized fatigue, cardiac arrhythmia, attention and memory deficit, and generalized systemic pain within minutes of exposure to telecommunications (Wifi, cellular phones), high tension lines and electronic devices. Tests for cerebral, cardiovascular, and other physiological anomalies proved negative, as did serological tests for inflammation, allergies, infections, auto-immune conditions, and hormonal imbalance. However, further investigation revealed deficits in cellular anti-oxidants and increased radical scavenging enzymes, indicative of systemic oxidative stress. 

Significantly, there was a large increase in circulating antibodies for oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDLox), byproducts of oxidative stress accumulating in membranes of vascular cells. Because a known primary effect of EMF exposure is to increase the concentration of cellular oxidants, we propose that pathology in this patient may be causally related to a resulting increase in LDLox synthesis. This in turn could trigger an exaggerated auto-immune response consistent with EHS symptoms. This case report thereby provides a testable mechanistic framework for EHS pathology with therapeutic implications for this debilitating and poorly understood condition.

#### Electrohypersensitivity as a Newly Identified and Characterized Neurologic Pathological Disorder: How to Diagnose, Treat, and Prevent It - March 2020

Since 2009, we built up a database which presently includes more than 2000 electrohypersensitivity (EHS) and/or multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) self-reported cases. 

This database shows that EHS is associated in 30% of the cases with MCS, and that  **MCS precedes the occurrence of EHS in 37% of these EHS/MCS-associated cases** . EHS and MCS can be characterized clinically by a similar symptomatic picture, and biologically by low-grade inflammation and an autoimmune response involving autoantibodies against O-myelin. 

Moreover,  **80% of the patients with EHS present with one, two, or three detectable oxidative stress biomarkers in their peripheral blood, meaning that overall these patients present with a true objective somatic disorder.** 

Moreover, by using ultrasonic cerebral tomosphygmography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we showed that cases have a defect in the middle cerebral artery hemodynamics, and we localized a tissue pulsometric index deficiency in the capsulo-thalamic area of the temporal lobes, suggesting the involvement of the limbic system and the thalamus. 

Altogether, these data  **strongly suggest that EHS is a neurologic pathological disorder which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented** . Because EHS is becoming a new insidious worldwide plague involving millions of people, we ask the World Health Organization (WHO) to include EHS as a neurologic disorder in the international classification of diseases.

* &quot;This suggests that chemical exposure induces a more frequent deficiency in vitamin D than exposure to EMF does.&quot;

Electrohypersensitivty (EHS) and multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) are new worldwide emerging neurologic disorders in the framework of sensitivity-related environmental pathology. We have recently extended and confirmed our previous observation showing that EHS and MCS share clinically identical symptoms and may co-exist as a unique, common, sensitivity-related neurologic syndrome in 25% of the cases. There is presently no published biological study of these disorders, except the one we have previously published as preliminary. In the present study, we show that EHS and MCS and the combined syndrome share identical biochemical changes. More precisely, by measuring levels of peripheral blood and urine molecular biomarkers in a cohort of 2,018 consecutive cases, we show that both disorders and the combined syndrome can be objectively characterized, in about 90% of the cases, by a decrease in the production of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate in urine, while in 30-50% they are characterized by increased levels of histamine and of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and/or 70, and of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine in the peripheral blood. Increased levels of histamine and HSP are indicators of low grade inflammation while increased levels of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine are indicators of blood-brain barrier disruption/opening. In addition, we show that in about 15% of the cases anti-myelin autoantibodies can be detected in the peripheral blood, accounting for the occurrence of an autoimmune response. Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the biochemical tests are discussed, as well as the role of these indicators used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. We also discuss cases with undetectable biological change for which they can be nevertheless diagnosed by cerebral neurotransmitters analysis in urine and brain imaging. On the basis of these biological data it is suggested that EHS and/or MCS are new brain disorders, generated via a common etiopathogenic mechanism.

#### 3% to 7% of people have Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity

 **Prevalence of Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Comprehensive Analysis** 

 **[Perplexity AI - Deep Research April 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/approximately-what-of-the-popu-yPBLZC8gT1.py1YCPHGx.g)** 

The prevalence of electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) and related conditions varies significantly across populations, studies, and terminology. This report examines current research on the prevalence of this controversial condition, exploring geographical differences, demographic patterns, and the scientific consensus.

  1. Understanding Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity

Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), also known by various other terms (electrohypersensitivity, electromagnetic sensitivity, Wi-Fi allergy, etc.), refers to a claimed sensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), to which adverse symptoms are attributed. It&#39;s important to note that EHS has no established scientific basis and is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by major health organizations, although the symptoms experienced by individuals are acknowledged as real &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

The condition is characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms, including headaches, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin sensations, concentration problems, and various other complaints that sufferers attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields from sources such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and power lines &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.

  1. Global Prevalence Estimates

The reported prevalence of EHS varies considerably across countries and studies:

    1. General Population Studies

- **Global Range**: Between 3% and 10% in developed countries, with higher reports in Scandinavian nations &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **United Kingdom**: A 2007 survey of 20,000 randomly selected people found a prevalence of 4% for symptoms self-attributed to EMF exposure &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Japan**: Recent research found self-reported EHS rates of 5.3% overall (3.4% in men and 6.1% in women) &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Sweden (1997)**: 1.5% of respondents in Stockholm County reported hypersensitivity to electric or magnetic fields &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Taiwan**: Rates declined from 13% in 2007 to 5% in 2013 &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Netherlands**: Prevalence decreased from 7% in 2009 to 4% in 2011 &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Germany**: Rates declined from 10% in 2009 to 7% in 2013 &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

    1. Specialized Studies

- **Occupational Medical Centers**: Much lower estimates of &quot;a few individuals per million in the population&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Self-help Groups**: These sources yield significantly higher estimates than clinical observations &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Severe Cases**: Approximately 10% of reported cases of EHS were considered severe, according to WHO data &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

  1. Demographic Patterns

    1. Gender Differences

A consistent finding across multiple studies is a higher prevalence of EHS among women compared to men:

- In the Japanese study, EHS was reported by 6.1% of women versus 3.4% of men &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

- Overall gender patterns show approximately two-thirds of EHS patients are women, and this ratio increases to three-quarters among those who also report multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) &lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;

    1. Age Distribution

- Higher prevalence is observed among older individuals &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

- Mean and median ages of EHS sufferers were around 48 years in database analysis &lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;

- In one study, prevalence was highest in the 60-69 year age group &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

  1. Comorbidity with Other Conditions

A significant finding is the frequent co-occurrence of EHS with other conditions:

- **Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)**: EHS is associated with MCS in approximately 30% of cases &lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Sequential Development**: MCS precedes the occurrence of EHS in 37% of EHS/MCS-associated cases &lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;

- **Depression**: Correlation between depression and EHS has been observed in several studies &lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;

  1. Geographical Variations

There are notable geographical differences in both the prevalence and the nature of reported symptoms:

- Higher reported incidence in Sweden, Germany, and Denmark compared to the United Kingdom, Austria, and France &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

- VDU-related symptoms were more prevalent in Scandinavian countries and more commonly related to skin disorders than elsewhere in Europe &lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;

  1. Scientific Consensus and Controversy

Despite the self-reported prevalence figures, the scientific consensus remains that EHS lacks a proven causal relationship with electromagnetic field exposure:

- Multiple blinded provocation studies have found that individuals claiming to have EHS cannot detect the presence of electromagnetic fields any better than chance would predict &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

- People reporting EHS are as likely to report symptoms following sham exposure as they are following genuine EMF exposure, suggesting a potential nocebo effect &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

- No specific symptom profile distinguishes the EHS group from the general population, though they report all symptoms at higher rates &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;

- As of 2005, the WHO recommended that claims of EHS be clinically evaluated to determine and rule out alternative diagnoses &lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

  1. Conclusion

Based on the available research, the prevalence of self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity appears to generally fall between 1% and 10% of the population, with most studies indicating figures in the  **3-7% range** . 

 **However, these figures vary significantly by country, age group, gender, and research methodology.** 

It&#39;s important to note that while these percentages represent people who attribute their symptoms to electromagnetic field exposure, the scientific consensus  **does not support a causal relationship between EMF exposure and these symptoms** . Nevertheless, the symptoms themselves are acknowledged as real and can significantly impact quality of life for affected individuals.

The ongoing controversy surrounding EHS highlights the complex interplay between physical symptoms, psychological factors, and environmental concerns in modern society.

Here, we present the case study of a self-reported EHS patient whose symptoms include severe headaches, generalized fatigue, cardiac arrhythmia, attention and memory deficit, and generalized systemic pain within minutes of exposure to telecommunications (Wifi, cellular phones), high tension lines and electronic devices. Tests for cerebral, cardiovascular, and other physiological anomalies proved negative, as did serological tests for inflammation, allergies, infections, auto-immune conditions, and hormonal imbalance. However, further investigation revealed deficits in cellular anti-oxidants and increased radical scavenging enzymes, indicative of systemic oxidative stress. \n\nSignificantly, there was a large increase in circulating antibodies for oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDLox), byproducts of oxidative stress accumulating in membranes of vascular cells. Because a known primary effect of EMF exposure is to increase the concentration of cellular oxidants, we propose that pathology in this patient may be causally related to a resulting increase in LDLox synthesis. This in turn could trigger an exaggerated auto-immune response consistent with EHS symptoms. This case report thereby provides a testable mechanistic framework for EHS pathology with therapeutic implications for this debilitating and poorly understood condition.\n`

We have recently extended and confirmed our previous observation showing that EHS and MCS share clinically identical symptoms and may co-exist as a unique, common, sensitivity-related neurologic syndrome in 25% of the cases. There is presently no published biological study of these disorders, except the one we have previously published as preliminary. In the present study, we show that EHS and MCS and the combined syndrome share identical biochemical changes. More precisely, by measuring levels of peripheral blood and urine molecular biomarkers in a cohort of 2,018 consecutive cases, we show that both disorders and the combined syndrome can be objectively characterized, in about 90% of the cases, by a decrease in the production of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate in urine, while in 30-50% they are characterized by increased levels of histamine and of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and/or 70, and of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine in the peripheral blood. Increased levels of histamine and HSP are indicators of low grade inflammation while increased levels of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine are indicators of blood-brain barrier disruption/opening. In addition, we show that in about 15% of the cases anti-myelin autoantibodies can be detected in the peripheral blood, accounting for the occurrence of an autoimmune response. Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the biochemical tests are discussed, as well as the role of these indicators used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. We also discuss cases with undetectable biological change for which they can be nevertheless diagnosed by cerebral neurotransmitters analysis in urine and brain imaging. On the basis of these biological data it is suggested that EHS and/or MCS are new brain disorders, generated via a common etiopathogenic mechanism.\n`

!!!!Hypersensitivity to man-made electromagnetic fields (EHS) correlates with immune responsivity to oxidative stress: a case report - Aug 2024
Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology Volume 17, 2024 - Issue 1 https://doi.org/10.1080/19420889.2024.2384874

There is increasing evidence that exposure to weak electromagnetic fields (EMFs) generated by modern telecommunications or household appliances has physiological consequences, including reports of electromagnetic field hypersensitivity (EHS) leading to adverse health effects. Although symptoms can be serious, no underlying mechanism for EHS is known and there is no general cure or effective therapy. Here, we present the case study of a self-reported EHS patient whose symptoms include severe headaches, generalized fatigue, cardiac arrhythmia, attention and memory deficit, and generalized systemic pain within minutes of exposure to telecommunications (Wifi, cellular phones), high tension lines and electronic devices. Tests for cerebral, cardiovascular, and other physiological anomalies proved negative, as did serological tests for inflammation, allergies, infections, auto-immune conditions, and hormonal imbalance. However, further investigation revealed deficits in cellular anti-oxidants and increased radical scavenging enzymes, indicative of systemic oxidative stress. 

Significantly, there was a large increase in circulating antibodies for oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDLox), byproducts of oxidative stress accumulating in membranes of vascular cells. Because a known primary effect of EMF exposure is to increase the concentration of cellular oxidants, we propose that pathology in this patient may be causally related to a resulting increase in LDLox synthesis. This in turn could trigger an exaggerated auto-immune response consistent with EHS symptoms. This case report thereby provides a testable mechanistic framework for EHS pathology with therapeutic implications for this debilitating and poorly understood condition.

!!!!Electrohypersensitivity as a Newly Identified and Characterized Neurologic Pathological Disorder: How to Diagnose, Treat, and Prevent It - March 2020
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21(6), 1915; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21061915

Since 2009, we built up a database which presently includes more than 2000 electrohypersensitivity (EHS) and/or multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) self-reported cases. 
This database shows that EHS is associated in 30% of the cases with MCS, and that __MCS precedes the occurrence of EHS in 37% of these EHS/MCS-associated cases__. EHS and MCS can be characterized clinically by a similar symptomatic picture, and biologically by low-grade inflammation and an autoimmune response involving autoantibodies against O-myelin. 
Moreover, __80% of the patients with EHS present with one, two, or three detectable oxidative stress biomarkers in their peripheral blood, meaning that overall these patients present with a true objective somatic disorder.__
Moreover, by using ultrasonic cerebral tomosphygmography and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we showed that cases have a defect in the middle cerebral artery hemodynamics, and we localized a tissue pulsometric index deficiency in the capsulo-thalamic area of the temporal lobes, suggesting the involvement of the limbic system and the thalamus. 
Altogether, these data __strongly suggest that EHS is a neurologic pathological disorder which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented__. Because EHS is becoming a new insidious worldwide plague involving millions of people, we ask the World Health Organization (WHO) to include EHS as a neurologic disorder in the international classification of diseases.

!!!!Molecular biomarkers in Electrohypersensitivity and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity: How They Can Help Diagnosis, Follow-Up, and in Etiopathologic Understanding - Jan 2024

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;22477&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;}
*&quot;This suggests that chemical exposure induces a more frequent deficiency in vitamin D than exposure to EMF does.&quot;
Electrohypersensitivty (EHS) and multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) are new worldwide emerging neurologic disorders in the framework of sensitivity-related environmental pathology. We have recently extended and confirmed our previous observation showing that EHS and MCS share clinically identical symptoms and may co-exist as a unique, common, sensitivity-related neurologic syndrome in 25% of the cases. There is presently no published biological study of these disorders, except the one we have previously published as preliminary. In the present study, we show that EHS and MCS and the combined syndrome share identical biochemical changes. More precisely, by measuring levels of peripheral blood and urine molecular biomarkers in a cohort of 2,018 consecutive cases, we show that both disorders and the combined syndrome can be objectively characterized, in about 90% of the cases, by a decrease in the production of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate in urine, while in 30-50% they are characterized by increased levels of histamine and of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and/or 70, and of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine in the peripheral blood. Increased levels of histamine and HSP are indicators of low grade inflammation while increased levels of protein S100B and nitrotyrosine are indicators of blood-brain barrier disruption/opening. In addition, we show that in about 15% of the cases anti-myelin autoantibodies can be detected in the peripheral blood, accounting for the occurrence of an autoimmune response. Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the biochemical tests are discussed, as well as the role of these indicators used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. We also discuss cases with undetectable biological change for which they can be nevertheless diagnosed by cerebral neurotransmitters analysis in urine and brain imaging. On the basis of these biological data it is suggested that EHS and/or MCS are new brain disorders, generated via a common etiopathogenic mechanism.

!!!!3% to 7% of people have Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity 
{FONT(size=&quot;18&quot;)}__Prevalence of Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Comprehensive Analysis    __{FONT}
__[https://www.perplexity.ai/search/approximately-what-of-the-popu-yPBLZC8gT1.py1YCPHGx.g|Perplexity AI - Deep Research April 2025]__
The prevalence of electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) and related conditions varies significantly across populations, studies, and terminology. This report examines current research on the prevalence of this controversial condition, exploring geographical differences, demographic patterns, and the scientific consensus.
 ## Understanding Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), also known by various other terms (electrohypersensitivity, electromagnetic sensitivity, Wi-Fi allergy, etc.), refers to a claimed sensitivity to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), to which adverse symptoms are attributed. It&#39;s important to note that EHS has no established scientific basis and is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by major health organizations, although the symptoms experienced by individuals are acknowledged as real [1].
The condition is characterized by a variety of non-specific symptoms, including headaches, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin sensations, concentration problems, and various other complaints that sufferers attribute to exposure to electromagnetic fields from sources such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and power lines [1].
 ## Global Prevalence Estimates
The reported prevalence of EHS varies considerably across countries and studies:
 ### General Population Studies
- **Global Range**: Between 3% and 10% in developed countries, with higher reports in Scandinavian nations [9]
- **United Kingdom**: A 2007 survey of 20,000 randomly selected people found a prevalence of 4% for symptoms self-attributed to EMF exposure [1]
- **Japan**: Recent research found self-reported EHS rates of 5.3% overall (3.4% in men and 6.1% in women) [5]
- **Sweden (1997)**: 1.5% of respondents in Stockholm County reported hypersensitivity to electric or magnetic fields [3]
- **Taiwan**: Rates declined from 13% in 2007 to 5% in 2013 [1]
- **Netherlands**: Prevalence decreased from 7% in 2009 to 4% in 2011 [1]
- **Germany**: Rates declined from 10% in 2009 to 7% in 2013 [1]
 ### Specialized Studies
- **Occupational Medical Centers**: Much lower estimates of &quot;a few individuals per million in the population&quot; [7]
- **Self-help Groups**: These sources yield significantly higher estimates than clinical observations [7]
- **Severe Cases**: Approximately 10% of reported cases of EHS were considered severe, according to WHO data [7]
 ## Demographic Patterns
 ### Gender Differences
A consistent finding across multiple studies is a higher prevalence of EHS among women compared to men:
- In the Japanese study, EHS was reported by 6.1% of women versus 3.4% of men [5]
- Overall gender patterns show approximately two-thirds of EHS patients are women, and this ratio increases to three-quarters among those who also report multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) [11]
 ### Age Distribution
- Higher prevalence is observed among older individuals [5]
- Mean and median ages of EHS sufferers were around 48 years in database analysis [11]
- In one study, prevalence was highest in the 60-69 year age group [1]
 ## Comorbidity with Other Conditions
A significant finding is the frequent co-occurrence of EHS with other conditions:
- **Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS)**: EHS is associated with MCS in approximately 30% of cases [11]
- **Sequential Development**: MCS precedes the occurrence of EHS in 37% of EHS/MCS-associated cases [11]
- **Depression**: Correlation between depression and EHS has been observed in several studies [5]
 ## Geographical Variations
There are notable geographical differences in both the prevalence and the nature of reported symptoms:
- Higher reported incidence in Sweden, Germany, and Denmark compared to the United Kingdom, Austria, and France [7]
- VDU-related symptoms were more prevalent in Scandinavian countries and more commonly related to skin disorders than elsewhere in Europe [7]
 ## Scientific Consensus and Controversy
Despite the self-reported prevalence figures, the scientific consensus remains that EHS lacks a proven causal relationship with electromagnetic field exposure:
- Multiple blinded provocation studies have found that individuals claiming to have EHS cannot detect the presence of electromagnetic fields any better than chance would predict [1]
- People reporting EHS are as likely to report symptoms following sham exposure as they are following genuine EMF exposure, suggesting a potential nocebo effect [1]
- No specific symptom profile distinguishes the EHS group from the general population, though they report all symptoms at higher rates [3]
- As of 2005, the WHO recommended that claims of EHS be clinically evaluated to determine and rule out alternative diagnoses [1]
 ## Conclusion
Based on the available research, the prevalence of self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity appears to generally fall between 1% and 10% of the population, with most studies indicating figures in the __3-7% range__. 
__However, these figures vary significantly by country, age group, gender, and research methodology.__
It&#39;s important to note that while these percentages represent people who attribute their symptoms to electromagnetic field exposure, the scientific consensus __does not support a causal relationship between EMF exposure and these symptoms__. Nevertheless, the symptoms themselves are acknowledged as real and can significantly impact quality of life for affected individuals.
The ongoing controversy surrounding EHS highlights the complex interplay between physical symptoms, psychological factors, and environmental concerns in modern society.
