#### Some vitamin D capsules can be twisted open and put the tastless powder on food, in drinks, or directly on your tongue

Example [Bio-Tech Pharmacal](http://www.biotechpharmacal.com/) tiny 5,000 IU and 50,000 IU capsules contain water-soluble powder

#### Some vitamin D is available as liquid, spray, topical, injection (monthly), etc

#### You do not even have to remember to take vitamin D on a regular basis

* Just put all the the vitamin D for a month in a  cup

* As you remember to do so during the month, take the vitamin D from the cup

* If needed, toward the end of the month take remaining capsules at a faster rate.

* Note: It is actually OK to take the vitamin D only twice a month, daily is not needed.

* Note: Some people (taking 50,000 IU capsules) would just take one capsule at the beginning of the month and put one capsule in the cup to be taken weeks later 

#### Can get Vitamin D from the sun and/or UVB lamps

#### Can fortify your entire family with vitamin D

At the beginning of the month put enough vitamin D for the entire family into some food/beverage which will be consumed over 2-4 weeks.

* Example month of fortification:100,000 IU for each adult, 15,000 IU for each child

> 2 adults and 4 children = 200,000 + 60.000 = 260,000 IU

> Stir into jam, fruit juice, butter,  . . . 

> Note - this assumes that each person eats the fortified food-stuff in proportion to their body weight

* Example: make fortified bread, pancakes, etc for the entire family on a weekly basis.

* “A teenager can have just as many problems as a 5-year-old. It likely has to do with anxiety and the negative associations with swallowing a pill.”

* "Many never outgrow the problem. Harris Interactive reported that [40 % of American adults have difficulty swallowing pills](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/40%25+of+American+Adults+Report+Experiencing+Difficulty+Swallowing...-a0112187875)"
