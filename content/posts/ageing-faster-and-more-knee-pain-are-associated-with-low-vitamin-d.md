Objectives

To examine the relationship between Vitamin D status and pain intensity and disability in individuals with and without knee pain, and to examine the role of epigenetics in this relationship.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of data from the UPLOAD-2 study (Understanding Pain and Limitations in OsteoArthritic Disease-2).

Participants

189 individuals aged 45–65 years and older.

Measurements

Serum Vitamin D levels, pain related interference and characteristic pain intensity measures, and the epigenetic clock GrimAge derived from blood analyses.

Results

Lower Vitamin D was associated with advanced epigenetic aging (AgeAccelGrim), greater pain and disability and that (AgeAccelGrim) mediated the relationship between Vitamin D status and self-reported pain (ab = -0.0799; CI <span>[-0.1492, -0.0237]</span>) and disability (ab = -0.0669; CI <span>[-0.1365, -0.0149]</span>) outcomes.

Conclusion

These data support the notion that lifestyle factors such as nutrition status play a key role in aging process, as well as the development and maintenance of age-related diseases such as pain. Modifying nutrition status could help promote healthy aging and reduce pain.
