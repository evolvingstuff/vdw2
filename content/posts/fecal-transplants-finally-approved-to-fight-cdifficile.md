#### Clostridium difficile treatment by Fecal Transplant finally approved by the FDA - July 2024

#### Fecal transplants could prevent 12,000 C.difficile deaths a year, but one person died, so lets wait – July 2019

 **Fact:**  15,000 people are dying each year in US hospitals  due to Clostridioides difficile

 **Fact:**  Fecal Transplants have been found to prevent at least 80% of Clostridioides difficile deaths

 **Fact:**  One person died one year of Fecal Translant (the donor had a deadly infection)

 **Conclusion:**  Let 11,999 people die each year until we agree on how to inspect the fecal transplants for infections

   * But strong regulation is a must to protect patient safety

   * “An estimated 15,000 deaths are directly attributable to C. diff infections.”
