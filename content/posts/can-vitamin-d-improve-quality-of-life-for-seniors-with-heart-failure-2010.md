Although early research on vitamin D focused on the effects of vitamin D deficiency on bone metabolism, more recent work has found a vast variety of roles for vitamin D throughout the body.1 Studies suggest that too little vitamin D might increase the risk for conditions as diverse as cardiovascular disease, cancer, autoimmune disease, and depression.1 The optimal level of vitamin D is not known, but there is general agreement that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) represents deficiency.1 However, some researchers have suggested that levels >80 nmol/L may be required for optimal health.2

Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with heart failure,3 and adequate vitamin D may reduce disease progression and symptom severity through suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system,3 suppression of parathyroid hormone,3 reduction of cardiac remodeling,4 and improvement in muscle strength.1 As an adjunct to pharmacological treatment of heart failure, vitamin D supplementation is appealing. Vitamin D can be obtained from sun exposure, over-the-counter dietary supplements, and prescription formulations. It has several potential additional benefits, including reducing the risk for falls, and few known adverse effects until high serum concentrations are reached (25-hydroxyvitamin D ?374 nmol/L).1

In this issue of Circulation: Heart Failure, Witham et al5 present the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the hypothesis that intermittent vitamin D supplementation improves physical function, as assessed with a 6-minute walk test, in older patients with systolic heart failure. Secondary outcomes include the timed up-and-go test, the Functional Limitation Profile, . . .
