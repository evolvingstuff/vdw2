Nursing Standard. 29, 46, 18-19. http://dx.doi.org/10.7748/ns.29.46.18.s21, 

A community nursing team in Surrey led by Pauline Bigwood was recognised in the 2015 Nursing Standard Nurse Awards for an innovative campaign to increase vitamin D awareness among parents and clinicians. The aim of the campaign is to improve child health by implementing Department of Health recommendations for vitamin D supplementation.

### Unfortunately recommends 5X to 10X less vitamin D than others

#### || |Recommends|Most other groups recommend

Pregnancy|400 IU| 3,000 â€“ 8,000 IU

Infants < 6 months| 0?   
Similar to WHO| 400 IU

Infants (> 6 months) | 320 IU|1600 IU

Elderly   
or get little sunshine| 400 IU| 4,000 IU||

Totally fails to mention increased need for vitamin D if darker skin, obese, etc, etc.
