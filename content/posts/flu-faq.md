#### I already have the flu - might vitamin D help?

Yes – a single 50,000 IU dose of vitamin D typically stops the flu

[It is the Vitamin D Hammer for the flu](/posts/influenza-prevented-by-40-ng-levels-or-treated-with-vitamin-d-hammer-50000-iu)

&nbsp; &nbsp;“The results are dramatic, with complete resolution of symptoms in 48 to 72 hours”

#### How quickly can I defend myself against the flu?

Loading doses will restore Vitamin D levels in 3-10 days

Over a million people have had Vitamin D loading doses

400,000 IU is generally needed for most people to achieve the 40 ng level needed

Example: 50,000 IU daily for 8 days 

Without a loading dose 2-10 months are needed to restore Vitamin D levels

#### Why does my doctor not know that Vitamin D can stop the flu?

#### What are the side effects I should be aware of?

About 1 in 300 people will have a side-effect of itchy skin within 2 days

This slight itching is typically due to the Vitamin D depleting your Magnesium stockpile

The rare itching is far less of a nuisance than the flu

#### Do you have a recommended supplier?

Bio-Tech Pharmacal has an excellent low-cost product

Their 50,000 IU bottle contains 100 capsules and costs only $20

It has enough capsules to protect 10 people in the flu season ($2/person)

#### My local store only has 2,000 IU of vitamin D - what should I do?

Twenty five 2,000 IU capsules will provide 50,000 IU

Note – a bottle containing 200 capsules of 2,000 IU has a total of 400,000 IU

#### How long will the loading dose protection last

Approximately 1 month.  

Taking 50,000 IU every two weeks is a good way to maintain the vitamin D level
