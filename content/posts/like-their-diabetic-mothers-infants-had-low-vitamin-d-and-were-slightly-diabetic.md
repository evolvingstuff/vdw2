OBJECTIVE:

To investigate the relationship between adipokines (visfatin, adiponectin) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and markers of insulin sensitivity in  **large for gestational age (LGA) infants** .

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

Forty LGA infants (25 LGA born to diabetic mothers and 15 LGA born to non-diabetic mothers) and 34 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants were recruited.

RESULTS:

FGIR, QUICK-I, adiponectin and 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in LGA with diabetic mother group than AGA and LGA with non-diabetic mother group. 

HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, visfatin and parathormone (PTH) levels were significantly higher in LGA with diabetic mother group than AGA and LGA with non-diabetic mother group.

CONCLUSION:

Based on the findings of this study, visfatin, adiponectin and 25(OH)D levels can be used as specific markers for insulin sensitivity and may help advance new therapies for glucose intolerance spectrum.
