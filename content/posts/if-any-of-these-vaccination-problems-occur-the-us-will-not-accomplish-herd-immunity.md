**1. Many adults will remain vaccine-hesitant**  (currently 30% of adults, might drop to 15%)

 **2. Many children (24% of the population) may not get vaccinated**  - various reasons

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No trials are currently underway for those under age 12

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Child vaccine trials may not get emergency approval 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if approved, 1/3 of parents surveyed refuse to have their children vaccinated 

 **3. Vaccine immunity may wear off too soon**  (1 year is typical for influenza vaccine)

 **4. Vaccines may not as effective against new variants**  - including those new variants generated by the vaccines

 **5. Vaccines might not actually stop asymptomatic infection** 

 **There is no contingency plan in case we do not achieve herd immunity with just vaccines** 

 **A good immune system can deal with varients. Vitamin D can improve the immune system**
