### <a href="/posts/vitamin-d-workshop-for-seniors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1912">Vitamin D Workshop for Seniors</a> contains the following summary chart

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

Assumes

* 2X more minutes going to Seattle, which is at a higher latitude (47 instead of 32)

* 3X more for seniors instead of youth

* 2X more for standing than lying down

* All items multiply

 **Incorrectly assumed that all skin produces the same amount of vitamin D** 

 **This is wrong - the table needs to be recomputed** 

Does not include

* Obese (2X more minutes)

* Black Skin (5X more minutes)

* Early morning or late afternoon sun (2X more minutes)

* Sun during Spring or Fall ( shoulder season >2X more minutes)

* Urban haze - perhaps 2X or 4x more minutes

* Light clouds

 **Vitamin D lasts in your body for about a month**

 **If you can't sunbathe all year, consider taking supplements, using a sunbed, or getting your <a href="/posts/own-uvb-lamp" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 3154">own UVB lamp</a>**

#### A study was published in May 2011 on the amount of sun needed to get 20 ng/ml of vitamin D

 **Mote: <a href="/posts/many-recommend-much-more" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1293">many recommend much more</a>: 30, 40, and even 50 ng/ml** 

*

   * [Air pollution reduces UV and thus vitamin D - Aug 2010](/posts/air-pollution-reduces-uv-and-thus-vitamin-d)

* Got sun/UV 3 times per week for 6 weeks

   * The danger of skin cancer if all tanning is done just once per week instead of spread over three times

* Assumed 30% of skin exposed (shorts and T-shirt)

* Assumed summer sun intensity

   * There is such a thing as a vitamin D winter

   * Very little vitamin D when your shadow is longer than you are

#### For white, thin youth living more than 30 degrees away from the equator

* 20–40 minutes if STANDING

* 10-20 minutes if LYING DOWN

#### But 20 ng/ml only prevents Rickets

 **If want to achieve, say 36ng/ml, then about 2X longer is needed** 

 **Standing – but be aware that any time over 30 minutes may cause skin cancer** 

* 1 hour of white, young, and thin

* 3 hours if white, elderly, and thin

* 5 hours if dark, young, and thin

* 30 hours if dark, elderly, and obese

   * totally impossible - longer than a day

   * Perhaps the factors do not multiply - we have no data

#### Tables from the paper - which assumes 3 times per week

* Vertical = standing

* Horizontal = lying down

* Better still would be on a slant board - to place the body perpendicular to the rays of the sun.

#### The vitamin D debate: translating controlled experiments into reality for human sun exposure times.

Photochem Photobiol. 2011 May;87(3):741-5. [doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.2011.00898.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2011.00898.x.) Epub 2011 Feb 14.

Exposure to sunlight, specifically ultraviolet radiation, has both positive and negative health effects. Maximizing the benefits (vitamin D synthesis) while minimizing the damage is a multifaceted problem in which many of the elements are poorly quantified. Here we show how rigorously conducted large sample-size laboratory studies of the effect of ultraviolet radiation dose on vitamin D status can be applied to real-life situations. This was achieved by modeling the radiation incident on different surfaces for different solar locations and equating it with the controlled exposures in laboratory studies.

Results from both model and experimental data show that relatively short exposures of a modest amount of unprotected skin to summer sunlight in northern climes, on a regular basis during lunchtime hours, increases vitamin D to sufficiency status (?20?ng?mL(-1) ) in the white Caucasian population. While both sun exposure conditions and human skin responses are variable in real life, these quantitative findings provide a guide for authorities devising sunlight exposure recommendations.

#### Vitamin D sun time suggestions condensed from [Translated German website](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.vitamindelta.de/&ei=gDmaTcTsKcWgtwePraCMDA&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQ7gEwAA&prev=/search?q=vitamin+delta&hl=en&prmd=ivns)

 **Time vs. skin type (on each side of the body – in Southern Europe/US, June-August, 11 – 2 PM)** 

* Type 1 may get 5 minutes per day.

* Type 2 can get 10 minutes per day.

* Type 3 may get 15 minutes per day.

* Type 4 should get 20 minutes per day.

* Type 5 should get 25 minutes per day.

* Type 6 should get 30 minutes per day.

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image">

#### Add 5 minutes if in Northern Europe/US

#### 2X times in shoulder seasons = March-May, September

#### 2X times in non-noon = 10-11 AM or 3-5 PM

#### 3X times if both shoulder season and non-noon (not 4X)

#### Tips:

* When first tanning, reduce the following times by half.

* Lie down so that you get into a shadow at the time allocated.

* Always take a short time with the sun.

* Do not exceed these times; it will redden your skin and cause skin damage and sunburn

#### Added by VitaminDWiki

* Increase times 3X if elderly

* Increase times 2X if overweight

* Increase times 3X if cloudy or you are in the shade

* Increase times 2X if hazy

* Increase times 2X if standing

* Add 10 minutes? if very far from the equator: Alaska/Finland

* Decrease times ( 1/2 ?) if near equator

* The times above assume

   * % of body exposed to the sun - we guess 30% = shorts and T-shirt

   * Daily? Rather than 3 days a week
