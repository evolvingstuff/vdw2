In infants receiving intermittent high dose vitamin D prophylaxis (600,000 IU ergocalciferol per dose orally) every 3-5 mo, the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites, calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) were determined before and 2 wk after each dose. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D (OHD) concentrations increased to well above normal but the values returned to the normal range before each subsequent dose. The 24,25- and 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D (<span>[OH]</span>2D) levels followed a pattern similar to that of 25-OHD, and both were closely related to the latter (r = 0.85, p less than 0.005, and r = 0.84, p less than 0.005, respectively). The 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations did not vary in a consistent pattern and remained largely within the normal range. All infants had normal Ca levels before the first dose but 14 infants (34%) later had one or both Ca values above the upper normal limit of 2.80 mmol/L (2.81-3.32 mmol/L), indicating that the vitamin D doses were excessive despite the lack of accumulative increases in serum vitamin D concentrations.
