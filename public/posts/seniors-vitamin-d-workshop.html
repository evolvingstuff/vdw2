The little stripe on the card turns purple when it is exposed to UV – the deeper the purple, the stronger the ultraviolet light. I bought it to confirm that the UVB bulb which I use in the winter actually works. A zero cost way to determine if there is enough UV is to just look at the length of your shadow. No shadow = virtually no UV, If your shadow is as long as you are tall then you will get about 1/2 of the UV that you would at noon on a sunny summer day. During the winter your shadow will be pretty long even at noon, indicating how little UV/vitamin D might get then. (Exception – you will get more UV with reflections from snow, water, and other reflective surfaces. This is one of the reasons you can get a sunburn when skiing in the winter. The other reason is that there is more UV at higher altitudes)</p><p>{IMG(fileId=&ldquo;1637&rdquo; max=&ldquo;400&rdquo;)}{IMG}</p><h3 id=i-suggest-that-every-senior-in-western-washington-supplement-with-at-least--span-stylecolor0904000-iuspan---of-vitamin-d>I suggest that EVERY senior in Western Washington supplement with at least <strong><span style=color:#090>4,000 IU</span></strong> of vitamin D</h3><p><strong><span style=color:#090>4,000 IU</span></strong> is the upper limit of what is currently the US recommendation. (suspect it will go higher within a few years). Many scientific groups recommend much more than <strong><span style=color:#090>4,000 IU</span></strong> , especially to groups at high risk of being vitamin D deficient. The Institute of Medicine has rather conservative amounts, but their recommendations are much larger now than before (1997).</p><p>The upper limit (at the top of the graph) for all adults they very conservatively put at <strong><span style=color:#090>4,000 IU</span></strong> of vitamin D per day. Just a year and a half ago I was unsure if I should take any more than 2,000 IU – which was their previous upper limit. After extensive study, I have found that virtually everyone can take 10,000 IU daily forever, especially if they balance their diet with co-factors.</p><p>The <strong><span style=color:#090>4,000 IU</span></strong> amount is actually a very conservative upper limit for adults, and provides some amazing disease prevention benefits. I suggest that everyone in our park (senior citizens living in Western Washington) take that much of vitamin D daily. I happen to personally take much more, but 4,000 is nice. (Note: the upper limit for children aged 1-4 is 500 IU and children aged 4-8 is 3,000 IU). The lower limits - at the bottom of the graph is 600 IU up until age 71, at which point it goee up to 800 IU. This &ldquo;minimum wage&rdquo; is enough to stop rickets, but not enough to live on.</p><p>By way of reference: people getting a good amount of sun in a day, without getting burned, will get 20,000 IU of vitamin D – which is 5X more than what the Institute of Medicine says is the upper limit.</p><p>Go figure!</p><p>{IMG(fileId=&ldquo;1337&rdquo; max=&ldquo;400&rdquo;)}{IMG}</p><p><strong><span style=color:#090>4,000 IU</span></strong> will raise the level of vitamin D in the blood to 40, which we can see on this graph is the level beyond which the magic starts to happen.</p><p>The horizontal axis is the level of vitamin D in the blood, not just in amount of the supplement.</p><p>The vertical axis shows the incidence of the disease compared to normal.</p><p>The top of the graph would be normal, whereas near to the bottom of the graph the incidence is only 20 percent of normal, that is, the incidence is 5X less.</p><p>This chart packs the results of many studies into an easy-to-read chart.</p><p>When vitamin D levels are higher than 40, many studies have found substantial reductions in heart attacks, falls, fractures, MS, Breast Cancer, Renal Cancer, All Cancers, and type 1 Diabetes.</p><p>(You can click on the slide to get more detail as well as have the text in the chart available for translation.)</p><p>In the lower left of the chart you can see that if you have a vitamin D level in your body of more than 20 you will greatly decrease the chance of getting rickets.</p><p>Unfortunately, it had been found that most elderly living in regions from the equator, such as Washington State, have vitamin D levels less than 20 – and so get none of the benefits shown on the right side of the graph.</p><img src=/attachments/d3.mock.jpg alt=image width=500px><h3 id=example-4x-decrease-in-cancer-when-take-just-1100-iu-of-vitamin-d>Example: 4X decrease in Cancer when take just 1100 IU of vitamin D</h3><h4 id=one-of-many-vitamin-d-random-controlled-trials>one of many Vitamin D Random Controlled Trials</h4><h3 id=1200-women-were-in-a-vitamin-d-clinical-trial-for-4-years>1200 Women were in a vitamin D clinical trial for 4 years,</h3><p>Those women in the trial branch which took <strong><span style=color:#00f>1100 IU of vitamin D and Calcium</span></strong> had <strong>four times less incidence of all kinds of Cancer</strong> .</p><p>These women were in their mid 60’s.</p><p>The <strong><span style=color:red>middle line </span></strong>shows some reduction in all forms of Cancer for those women who just got just Calcium with no vitamin D.</p><p>This study is as good as it gets – it was a randomized, double blind, <strong><span style=color:#090>placebo controlled </span></strong>clinical trial.</p><p>Chart was shown at <a href=/posts/cdc-grand-rounds style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 774">CDC Grand Rounds Aug 2010</a></p><p>Full details of the trial can be found <a href=/posts/here style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1659">HERE</a>.</p><p><strong>This clinical trial used only 1100 IU of vitamin D.</strong></p><p>It turns out that as you get more and more vitamin D that you get less and less Cancer.</p><p>The results are not in yet for clinical trials with 4,00 IU of vitamin D, but I suspect that they will find significantly more than a 6X reduction in Cancer.</p><p><a href=/posts/click-here style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1331">CLICK HERE</a> for a glance at the many high dose vitamin D clinical trials.</p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1750249976"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1750249976",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1750249976"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1750249976"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1750249976"></script></body></html>
