The primary purpose of this study was to identify if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations predict muscular weakness after intense exercise. We hypothesized that pre-exercise serum 25(OH)D concentrations inversely predict exercise-induced muscular weakness. Fourteen recreationally active adults participated in this study. Each subject had one leg randomly assigned as a control. The other leg performed an intense exercise protocol. Single-leg peak isometric force and blood 25(OH)D, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, albumin, interferon (IFN)-γ, and interleukin-4 were measured prior to and following intense exercise. Following exercise, serum 25(OH)D concentrations increased (p < 0.05) immediately, but within minutes, subsequently decreased (p < 0.05). Circulating albumin increases predicted (p < 0.005) serum 25(OH)D increases, while IFN-γ increases predicted (p < 0.001) serum 25(OH)D decreases. Muscular weakness persisted within the exercise leg (p < 0.05) and compared to the control leg (p < 0.05) after the exercise protocol. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations inversely predicted (p < 0.05) muscular weakness (i.e., control leg vs. exercise leg peak isometric force) immediately and days (i.e., 48-h and 72-h) after exercise,  **suggesting the attenuation of exercise-induced muscular weakness with increasing serum 25(OH)D prior to exercise** . Based on these data, we conclude that pre-exercise serum 25(OH)D concentrations could influence the recovery of skeletal muscle strength after an acute bout of intense exercise.

In experimental rats, vitamin D treatment accelerated the recovery in muscular strength after Injury. see VitaminDWiki [Deadly amount of vitamin D speeds up recovery of crushed muscles in rats – Dec 2012](/posts/deadly-amount-of-vitamin-d-speeds-up-recovery-of-crushed-muscles-in-rats)

 **Conclusions** 

Muscle weakness hinders millions of people worldwide every year and is mediated by a variety of conditions, including  aging, disease, inactivity,  limb  immobilization, repetitive use, and intense or  unaccustomed exercise. In the present investigation, we reveal that muscular weakness after an intense  exercise bout is abrogated with increasing  serum 25(OH)D concentration  prior to exercise.  However,  this was apparent immediately and several days (2-day  and  3-day), but not 1-day, after intense  exercise.  Additionally,  IFN-γ and albumin predicted serum 25(OH)D concentration fluctuations, and due on these fluctuations, we recommend caution when interpreting serum 25(OH)D concentrations  immediately  after intense exercise and/or during an acute inflammatory response.  We conclude that maintaining an adequate  serum 25(OH)D  concentration could attenuate muscular weakness after  intense exercise.  Given the feasibility of increasing 25(OH)D  concentrations in the blood, future  research  investigating  the influence of  diverse  vitamin D  interventions on the alleviation of muscular  weakness after muscular insult are encouraged in humans.
