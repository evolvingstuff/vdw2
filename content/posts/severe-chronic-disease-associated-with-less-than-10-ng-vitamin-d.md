Background and aims. Hypovitaminosis D is associated with adverse health outcomes including several bone and non-bone chronic diseases. It remains unclear whether hypovitaminosis D leads to more numerous or more severe chronic diseases. Our objective was to determine whether there was an association between the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (i.e., 25OHD -25nmol/L) and, respectively, the number and the severity of chronic diseases assessed with the  **Kaplan-Feinstein index (KFI)**  among geriatric inpatients. 

Methods. Two hundred forty older Caucasian adults admitted between December 2008 and September 2009 to the geriatric acute care unit of Angers University Hospital, France (mean, 84.6±0.4years; 68.8% women) were included in this cross-sectional study. Serum 25OHD, KFI score and the number of chronic diseases (i.e., diseases lasting at least 3 months or running a course with minimal change, whatever their nature or site) were assessed. 

Subjects were divided into 2 groups according to 25OHD concentration (either deficient for 25OHD< 25nmol/L, or non-deficient for 25OHD>25nmol/L). Age, gender, the use of vitamin D supplements, the number of chronic diseases, serum parathyroid hormone and season tested were used as potential confounders. 

Results. Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 35.2±1.7nmol/L. The 102  **(42.5%) subjects with 25OHD deficiency had higher KFI compared to their counterparts (P=0.008).** 

Vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated with the number of chronic diseases (adjusted ?=- 0.37 with P=0.216), but with KFI (unadjusted ?=1.33 with P=0.008; adjusted ?=1.37 with P=0.010). 

Conclusions. Irrespective of the number of chronic diseases, 25OHD deficiency was associated with the severity of chronic diseases.
