# Multiple sclerosis, a cause of secondary osteoporosis? What is the evidence and what are the clinical implications?

Acta Neurol Scand Suppl. 2011;(191):44-9. [doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2011.01543.x.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0404.2011.01543.x.)

Background?-  Both women and men with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. Methods?-  A non-systematic review of the prevalence, pathogensis and treatment of osteoporosis in patients with multiple sclerosis. 

Results?-  MS and osteoporosis share aetiological risk factors such as smoking and hypovitaminosis D, as well as pathegenetic players such as osteopontin and osteoprotegerin. Recently, low bone mineral density (BMD) values have been measured shortly after diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome and MS and in fully ambulatory persons with MS below 50?years of age. Studies consistently show that BMD at the femoral neck decreases with increasing MS-related disability. Osteoporosis-related fractures cause increased morbidity and mortality and add to the burden of having MS. 

Conclusion?-  We argue that MS, like a number of other chronic diseases, is a cause of secondary osteoporosis. Therefore, bone health assessment should be a part of the integral management of persons with MS. 

We suggest that BMD be measured shortly after diagnosis, that BMD measurements be repeated depending on BMD values and individual osteoporosis risk profile, and that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D be monitored. All persons with MS should receive bone health advice.
