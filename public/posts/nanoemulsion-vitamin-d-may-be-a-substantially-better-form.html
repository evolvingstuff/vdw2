<img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/liver-problems-f7.jpg alt=image width=300><p>Background</p><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with hyperlipidemia, obesity and type II diabetes. Due to increasing prevalence of these diseases globally, NAFLD is considered as a common form of chronic liver diseases. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin with reported anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and immune modulating activity. Hypovitaminosis D often coexists with NAFLD and various studies reported beneficial role of vitamin D in modulating NAFLD. However, variable oral bioavailability, poor water solubility, and chemical degradation hinder the clinical application of vitamin D.</p><p>Purpose: We evaluated the potential protective effect of Vitamin D nanoemulsion (developed by sonication and pH-Shifting of pea protein isolate and canola oil) compared to conventional vitamin D against liver injury in rats fed with high fat diet (HFD).</p><p>Methods: We analyzed liver function enzymes, lipid profile, lipid metabolism, levels and histopathology of inflammation and fibrosis in rat liver tissues.</p><p>Results</p><p>HFD fed rats exhibited deterioration of liver function, poor lipid profile, decreased fatty acid oxidation and up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix deposition. Vitamin D administration reduced elevated liver enzymes, improved lipid profile, enhanced fatty acid oxidation and attenuated liver inflammation and fibrosis. Interestingly, vitamin D nanoemulsion was superior to conventional vitamin D with remarkable hepatoprotective effect against HFD-induced liver injury.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This study demonstrated vitamin D nanoemulsion as a more efficient formulation with more prominent hepatoprotective effect against HFD-induced liver injury compared to conventional oral vitamin D.</p><p><strong>From the PDF</strong></p><ul><li><p>“Currently, there is no approved therapy for NAFLD”</p></li><li><p>“Nanoemulsions are liquid dispersions in which the size of droplets ranges from (50 to 500 nm) <sup>[19]</sup>.

Although it can be synthesized through sun exposure and obtained from fortified foods, VD inadequacy is epidemic worldwide. Therefore innovative strategies are necessary for improving VD status. The present study examined VD absorption via nanoscale delivery systems.</p><p>METHODS AND RESULTS: We examine the physical characteristics and in vitro bioaccessibility of cholecalciferol (VD3 ) in nanoemulsion using a <strong>simulated gastrointestinal tract system</strong> .</p><p>To evaluate the in vivo bioavailability, we orally administer three groups of mice with</p><ul><li><p>VD3 nanoemulsion,</p></li><li><p>VD3 coarse emulsion, or</p></li><li><p>vehicle nanoemulsion without VD3,</p></li></ul><p>and the serum 25(OH)D3 is measured using radioactive immunoassay. The nanoemulsion-based delivery system increases the in vitro bioaccessibility by 3.94-folds (p &lt; 0.05), as indicated by the concentration of vitamin D3 in micelles.</p><p>Our animal study shows that, when compared to the vehicle group, the coarse emulsion numerically increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 36%, whereas the nanoemulsion statistically significantly increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by <strong>73%</strong> (p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a nanoemulsion-based delivery system is a promising approach to improve VD bioavailability, and further studies are warranted to determine its efficacy in humans.</p><p><strong>References of interest</strong></p><ul><li><p>Nanocarriers based delivery of nutraceuticals for cancer prevention and treatment: A review of recent research developments</p></li><li><p>Evaluation of vehicle substances on vitamin D bioavailability: A systematic review – 2010</p></li><li><p>Nanoemulsion delivery systems for oil-soluble vitamins: Influence of carrier oil type on lipid digestion and vitamin D3 bioaccessibility</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;..the measured <strong>bioaccessibility of vitamin D3</strong> decreased in the following order: corn oil ≈ fish oil > orange oil > mineral oil > MCT.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/types-of-oil.pdf>Download the type of oil PDF from Sci-Hub via VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></blockquote><hr><h4 id=technical-details-for-making-vit-d-nanoemulsion--2015>Technical details for making Vit.

SE relies on the formation of small oil droplets when an oil/surfactant mixture is titrated into an aqueous solution.</p><p>The influence of oil phase composition (vitamin D and MCT), surfactant-to-oil ratio (SOR), surfactant type (Tween 20, 40, 60, 80 and 85), and stirring conditions on the initial particle size of vitamin D nanoemulsions was studied. Nanoemulsions with small droplet diameters (d&lt;200 nm) could be formed using Tween 80 at SOR⩾1 at high stirring speeds (800 rpm).</p><p>These systems were relatively stable to droplet growth at ambient temperatures (&lt;10% in diameter after 1 month storage), but unstable to heating (T>80°C). The <strong>thermal stability</strong> of the nanoemulsions could be improved by adding a cosurfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)). The spontaneous emulsification method is simple and inexpensive to carry out and therefore has great potential for forming nanoemulsion-based delivery systems for food, personal care, and pharmaceutical applications.</p><h4 id=vitamin-e-nanoemulsion--2016>Vitamin E nanoemulsion – 2016</h4><p><strong>The influence of droplet size on the stability, in vivo digestion, and oral bioavailability of vitamin E emulsions</strong></p><p>Food & Function, 7(5), 2294-2302, 2016, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1039/c5fo01517k>https://doi.org/10.1039/c5fo01517k</a></p><p>S.

Anandharamakrishnan - Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, Central Food Technological Research Institute</p><p>Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is a nutraceutical compound, which has been shown to possess potent antioxidant and anticancer activity. However, its biological activity may be limited by its poor bioavailability. Colloidal delivery systems have shown wide applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries to deliver lipophilic bioactive compounds. In this study, we have developed conventional and nanoemulsions of vitamin E from food grade ingredients (sunflower oil, saponin, and water) and showed the nanoemulsion formulation increased the oral bioavailability when compared to the conventional emulsion.</p><p><strong>The mean droplet diameters in the nano and conventional emulsions were 0.277 and 1.285 μm, respectively.</strong> The stability of the emulsion formulation after thermal processing, long-term storage at different temperatures, mechanical stress and in plasma was determined. The results showed that the saponin coated nanoemulsion was stable to droplet coalescence during thermal processing (30-90 °C), long-term storage and mechanical stress when compared to the conventional emulsion. The biological fate of the emulsion formulations were studied using male Wistar rats as an animal model. The emulsion droplet stability during passage through the gastrointestinal tract was evaluated by their introduction into rat stomachs. Microscopy was used to investigate the structural changes that occurred during digestion. Both the conventional emulsion and nanoemulsion formulations showed strong evidence of droplet flocculation and coalescence during in vivo digestion. The in vivo oral bioavailability study revealed that vitamin E in a nanoemulsion form showed a <strong>3-fold increase in the AUC</strong> when compared to the conventional emulsion. The information reported in this study will facilitate the design of colloidal delivery systems using nanoemulsion formulations.</p><hr><h4 id=nanoencapsulation-of-vitamin-d-in-fish-oil--90-day-shelf-life--2017>Nanoencapsulation of Vitamin D in fish oil – 90 day shelf life – 2017</h4><p><strong>Fish oil based vitamin D nanoencapsulation by ultrasonication and bioaccessibility analysis in simulated gastro-intestinal tract</strong></p><p>Ultrasonics Sonochemistry, 39, 623-635, 2017, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.05.021>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultsonch.2017.05.021</a></p><p>Niharika Walia - Vellore Institute of Technology University, University of Alberta</p><p>Nandita Dasgupta - Vellore Institute of Technology University</p><p>Shivendu Ranjan - Vellore Institute of Technology University, Research Wing, Veer Kunwar Singh Memorial Trust, Chapra, India, Xpert Arena Technological Services Pvt. Ltd., Chapra, India</p><p>Recently, nanoemulsions have been employed for different applications including food and drug industries for efficient nutrient delivery system. In this study, vitamin D (a lipophilic molecule) was encapsulated in fish oil for higher oral bioavailability. The oil-in-water nanoemulsion was formulated by ultrasonication technique with a droplet size range of 300-450nm and a <strong>shelf life of more than 90 days</strong> . The influence of oil, water and surfactant concentration was investigated by phase diagram. The formulated nanoemulsion had encapsulation efficiency in the range of 95.7-98.2%. Further, nanoemulsion passed through simulated gastro-intestinal tract revealed an <strong>increased bioavailability than non-encapsulated vitamin</strong> . Thus, the formulation can be used as a drug delivery vehicle for various lipophilic compounds. Till date, no one have fabricated an efficient nano-vehicle for the delivery of vitamin D as well as analyzed the efficient delivery system in simulated GI-tract, this is first of its kind study in this regard. This can be scaled up further after analyzing the safety aspects.</p><h4 id=review-of-vitamin-nanoemulsions--2018>Review of Vitamin Nanoemulsions – 2018</h4><p><strong>Research Updates on Different Vitamins Based Nanoemulsions and Characterization of Nanoemulsions</strong></p><p>In: An Introduction to Food Grade Nanoemulsions.

Phase diagram was constructed to investigate the influence of oil, water and surfactant concentration.</p><p>Vitamin D encapsulated cinnamon oil NE was fabricated by wash out method followed by ultrasonication in similar fashion. The hydrodynamic size of cinnamon oil NE and vitamin D encapsulated cinnamon oil NE was observed as 40.52 and 48.96 nm in complete DMEM F12 media respectively.

Both the NEs arrested the cell cycle progression in G0/G1 phase, showed increased expression of Bax, capase-3 and caspase-9 and decrease expression of BcL2 proteins along with significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in apoptotic cell population and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. NEs were also evaluated for bactericidal efficacy against E. coli. Thus, both NEs have cytotoxic, genotoxic and antibacterial potential and hence can also be used in food industry with cinnamon oil as carrier for lipophilic nutraceutical like vitamin D.</p><p>PMID: 29631227 DOI: 10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.03.041</p><hr><h4 id=liposome-1000-nm-of-both-curcumin-and-vitamin-d3---april-2018>Liposome (1000 nm) of both curcumin and vitamin D3 - April 2018</h4><p>Structural characterization of multilamellar liposomes coencapsulating curcumin and vitamin D3</p><p>Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects, online 9 April 2018, <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.04.018>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.04.018</a></p><p>Matheus Andrade Chavesa, , Pedro Leonidas Oseliero Filhob, , Camila Garcia Jangea, 1, , Rita Sinigaglia-Coimbrac, , Cristiano Luis Pinto Oliveirab, , Samantha Cristina Pinhoa, ,</p><p>This study aimed the production of multilamellar liposomes coencapsulating two hydrophobic bioactives, curcumin and vitamin D3, which present antioxidant and nutraceutical properties. Liposomes were produced by proliposomes hydration and stabilized with a mixture of xanthan and guar gums. Proliposomes were produced by coating of micronized sucrose method. Physicochemical properties of the dispersions were evaluated over 42 days of refrigerated storage. Microstructural characterization were performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small deformation rheological analyses. Liposomes showed spherical and near-spherical shapes and presented hydrodynamic diameters in the 680-1580 nm range. Curcumin and cholecalciferol were loaded into the same vesicles, with preservation efficiencies ranging from 89.6 to 93.3% and from 88.3 to 91.3%, respectively, after 42 days of storage. SAXS data showed that the lipid bilayer of liposomes produced in the presence of curcumin, vitamin D3, or a mixture of both, are very similar. Also, higher amounts of vitamin D3 did not affect negatively the stability of phospholipid vesicles. Overall, it was demonstrated that the coencapsulation of curcumin and vitamin D3 by liposomes is feasible and high contents of bioactives were retained throughout the storage time.</p><hr><h4 id=activated-vitamin-d-in-nanoemulsion---mice-june-2019>Activated Vitamin D in nanoemulsion - mice June 2019</h4><p><strong>Polymeric Nanoparticles Containing Both Antigen and Vitamin D3 Induce Antigen-Specific Immune Suppression</strong></p><p>Found it difficult to understand the study</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/active-vitamin-d-in-nanoemulsion.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=covid-19-fought-by-vitamin-d-nanoemulsion>COVID-19 fought by Vitamin D nanoemulsion</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/covid-19-defeated-3x-faster-by-420000-iu-vitamin-d-nanoemulsion-rct>COVID-19 defeated 3x faster by 420,000 IU Vitamin D nanoemulsion – RCT Nov 12, 2020</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/covid-19-inflammation-extinguished-by-60000-iu-of-vitamin-d-nanoemulsion-daily-for-a-week-rct>COVID-19 inflammation extinguished by 60,000 IU of vitamin D nanoemulsion daily for a week – RCT May 2021</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/vitamin-d-nanoemulsion-with-comments-on-covid-19>Vitamin D nanoemulsion, with comments on COVID-19 – June 2, 2020</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>shortURL = is.gd/NanoD</strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><a href=/tags/asthma.html><span class=tag>asthma</span></a>
