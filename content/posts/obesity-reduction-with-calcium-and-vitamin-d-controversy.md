#### Calcium and vitamin D in obesity

Nutr Res Rev. 2012 May 16:1-12.

New and more effective nutritional measures are urgently needed for the prevention of obesity. 

The role of Ca and vitamin D in obesity has been recently implicated. 

Low Ca intake and low vitamin D status have been linked with an increased risk of obesity in epidemiological studies; however, clinical intervention trials designed to test this association have produced  **controversial results** . 

The suggested anti-obesity mechanisms of Ca and vitamin D include the regulation of 

* adipocyte death (apoptosis), 

* adipogenesis and 

* lipid metabolism. 

Dietary Ca has been also shown to increase faecal fat excretion. 

The potential role of Ca and vitamin D in shifting energy balance towards a more negative state is an area of considerable interest. 

Ultimately, a review of recent research findings does not allow the reaching of a definitive conclusion that increasing Ca intake and rising vitamin D status will influence fat mass and body weight or decrease the risk of obesity and overweight.

#### Notes:

* Elsewhere we have seen that Calcium and Vitamin D reduces weight in only about 1/3 of the women. Weight loss may be due to differences in genes (human or non-human genes)

* Obesity has been increasing around the world at the same time that vitamin D has been decreasing

* It seems that obesity is NOT increasing in those countries which have high levels of vitamin D

> From a list of countries with low levels of obesity Brunei, Sri Lanka, Gambia, Central African Republic, Cambodia, East Timor, Bhutan
