Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal; Volume 40, Issue 3, pages 229–240, March 2012

The purpose was to develop a vitamin D screening tool for use in community health/wellness settings. Fifty-four healthy Caucasian women of normal weight (body mass index = 18–24.9) and obese weight (body mass index ?30) had anthropometrics measured, and completed three-day food records, vitamin D screening tools, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D tests. Findings provided evidence of usefulness of three specific screening tool items (sunscreen use, obesity, dairy consumption) and indicated need for more precision about sunscreen use. 

### Odds for vitamin D inadequacy were

* 5 times lower with sunscreen use, 

* 6 times higher with low dairy consumption, and 

* 10 times higher with self-reported obesity, X2 (5, n = 54) = 43.24, P <.01. 

The study provided initial verification of self-report items useful in assessing vitamin D inadequacy. Following refinement and testing with larger, less homogeneous samples, the instrument can serve as a useful, cost-effective vitamin D screening tool in community health/wellness settings.

## Possible reasons for reported use of sunscreen associated with increased vitamin D (unexpected)

1. did not apply enough sunscreen

1. did not re-apply sunscreen often enough

1. participants were outdoors various times when not using any sunscreen

> Confusion about how often is "regularly apply"
