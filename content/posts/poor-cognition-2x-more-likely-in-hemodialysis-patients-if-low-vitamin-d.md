Objective: Vitamin D insufficiency and the cognitive function decline are both common in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). The present study evaluated the relation between cognitive function and circulating vitamin D levels in HD patients in Wannan Medical College Affiliated Yijishan Hospital, China.

Methods: This study was conducted in 80 patients receiving HD in Wannan Medical College Affiliated Yijishan Hospital. To measure cognitive function, Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) Chinese Version was used. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span>, which is applied to assess vitamin D status, was tested. One-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test, and the correlation and regression analysis were used in this study.

Results: Based on the MoCA-B, cognitive function decline (the scores below 26) was present in 28 HD patients, accounting for 35% (28/80). The mean age of these patients is 50.5 ± 10.9 years old. The mean level of 25(OH)D was 16.1 ± 7.3 ng/ml in 80 HD patients. In univariate analysis, there was a significant relationship between MoCA-B score and serum 25(OH)D level (p < 0.05). The level of 25(OH)D was positively correlated with MoCA-B score (r = 0.312, p = 0.023), and the association was independent of demographic and clinical features.

Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to cognitive function decline in HD patients. Serum level of 25(OH)D is an independent protective factor of cognitive function in the HD patients.
