#### Dynamic Evaluation of Vitamin D Metabolism in Post-Bariatric Patients

J Clin Med. 2023 Dec 19;13(1):7. [doi: 10.3390/jcm13010007.](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13010007.)

Background: findings from the previously conducted studies indicate altered regulatory mechanisms of calcium and vitamin D metabolism in obese patients and a role for bariatric surgery in regulating vitamin D metabolism; however, the available data is controversial and does not provide an adequate understanding of the subject.

Methods: we evaluated serum parameters of vitamin D and mineral metabolism (vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D3, 25(OH)D2, 1,25(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3, and 24,25(OH)2D3), vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), free 25(OH)D, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), parathyroid hormone (PTH), total calcium, albumin, phosphorus, creatinine, magnesium) in 30 patients referred for bariatric surgery in comparison with 30 healthy volunteers of similar age, sex and baseline 25(OH)D3. Patients were also followed up with repeated laboratory assessments 3 months and 6 months after surgery. During the first 3 months, patients were prescribed high-dose cholecalciferol therapy  **(50,000 IU per week)** , with subsequent correction based on the results of the 3-month visit examination.

Results: Preoperatively, patients with morbid obesity were characterized by a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (median 25(OH)D3 level  **11.9**  (6.8; 22.2) ng/mL), significantly lower levels of active vitamin D metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3 (20 (10; 37) vs. 39 (33; 50) pg/mL, p < 0.001), lower serum albumin-adjusted calcium levels (2.24 (2.20; 2.32) vs. 2.31 (2.25; 2.35) mmol/L, p = 0.009) and magnesium levels (0.79 (0.72; 0.82) vs. 0.82 (0.78; 0.85) mmol/L, p = 0.043) with simultaneous similar PTH levels (p = 0.912), and higher DBP levels (328 (288; 401) vs. 248 (217; 284) mg/L, p < 0.001). The 25(OH)D3 levels remained suboptimal ( **24.5**  (14.7; 29.5) ng/mL at the 3-month visit and  **17.9**  (12.4; 21.0) ng/mL at the 6-month visit, p = 0.052)  **despite recommended high-dose cholecalciferol supplementation** . Patients also demonstrated an increase in 1,25(OH)2D3 levels (38 (31; 52) pg/mL at the 3-month visit and 49 (29; 59) pg/mL at the 6-month visit, p < 0.001) without a change in PTH or calcium levels during the follow-up.

Conclusion: our results of a comprehensive laboratory evaluation of vitamin D status and mineral metabolism in patients undergoing bariatric surgery highlight the importance of improving current
