* Most of the health benefits of the sun are due to the UVB production of Vitamin D  around noon.

* However, the authors point out in detail, the additional non-noon benefits of the sun, due to UVA production of Nitric Oxide in the skin

* Previous to this book I was only enjoying the sun at noon in the summer (Seattle)

>  **<span style="color:#00F;">This book made be be aware of the non-noon and non-summer benefits of the sun, which I had wondered about for years</span>** 

* UVA can get through windows, but UVB cannot

* Blue or bright light decreases depression

#### The Headlines

Voluminous research in the past few years has proved the truth about the remarkable health benefits of the Sun. Why haven't you read these Headlines?

* Sun exposure in the U.S. has been reduced by 90% in the last 70-100 years, while the risk of melanoma has increased by at least 3,000%. Then how can anyone believe sun exposure causes melanoma?

* As in the US, while sun exposure in Europe has profoundly decreased, there has been a spectacular increase in melanoma.

* Many melanomas occur on the parts of the body that seldom or never see the sun, including inside and around sex organs, in the armpits, in the mouth, on the soles of the feet and on areas nearly always covered by clothing.

* Women who completely avoid the sun have an increased risk of breast cancer of 1,000%, compared to those regularly exposed to sun.

* Women in Spain who actively seek the sun have a reduced risk of hip fracture of 91%.

* Sunbathing can often reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure within an hour, and the effect lasts for about two more hours.

* Multiple Sclerosis is most prevalent in the northern part of the Northern hemisphere, but its prevalence virtually disappears in sunny equatorial climes.

* Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) such as Prozac work by keeping serotonin in circulation. Sun exposure can increase the amount of serotonin in the circulation by 800% in one day without toxic side effects, and the sun is free.

* Regular, habitual sun exposure without sunscreens REDUCES the risk of melanoma.

* Outdoor workers obtain 3-10 times the annual sunlight exposure as indoor workers, yet they have lower incidences of melanoma. Why?

* Women with active sunbathing habits live longer.

* Women who avoid sun exposure have twice the risk of allcause death over 20 years, compared to those who are actively in the sun.

* Chronic sun exposure is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.

* Regular exposure to UV leads to an almost complete disappearance of DNA damage where skin cancer has been initiated.

* There are 324 deaths associated with diseases of low sun exposure for every 1 death related to diseases of high sun exposure.

* UV radiation, from sunlight, is the best natural source of vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements alone are not an effective substitute for adequate sun exposure.

* Public health messages in the past 50 years, urging avoidance of sun exposure and the use of chemical sunscreens, have likely contributed to the rise in melanoma incidence.

* Chemical sunscreens have unbalanced Mother Nature, which is one reason why melanoma has INCREASED exponentially, accompanying the exponential increase in sunscreen sales during the past 30 years.

* DNA damage is reduced with a tan.

* Low blood levels of vitamin D are a major indicator of sunlight deficiency.

* If sunscreen is not re-applied every hour it creates more skin damage than if one used nothing at all.

* Women who used sunbeds for 20 years had a 23% decrease in the risk for all-cause death.
