#### Vitamin D Metabolism Is Dysregulated in Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Am J Respir Crit Care Med.  2020 Mar 18, DOI: 10.1164/rccm.201909-1867OC

<div class="border" style="background-color:#FFFAE2;padding:15px;margin:10px 0;border-radius:5px;width:800px">

 **Stimulus:**  120,000 IU of Vitamin D every 2 months for a year

 **Response:**  asthmatics  8 ng, COPD  9 ng, controls 16 ng

 **This has been seen many times: takes 2 to 3X more vitamin D to treat a disease than to prevent it** 

 **Possible reasons include** 

1. The disease actually consumes Vitamin D

1. Poor Vitamin D genes ==> both disease and need for higher doses

1. Poor liver processing

1. Poor gut processing

Note: #3 and #4 could be checked by by-passing the gut and liver

Rationale: Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with asthma and COPD. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) levels may represent a cause or a consequence of these conditions.

Objective: To determine whether vitamin D metabolism is altered in asthma or COPD.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in 186 adults to determine whether the 25(OH)D response to  **six oral doses of 3 mg vitamin D3, administered over one year** , differed between those with asthma or COPD vs. controls. Serum concentrations of vitamin D3, 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25<span>[OH]</span>2D3) were determined pre- and post-supplementation in 93 adults with asthma, COPD or neither condition, and metabolite-to-parent compound molar ratios were compared between groups to estimate hydroxylase activity. Additionally, we analyzed fourteen datasets to compare expression of 1α,25<span>[OH]</span>2D3-inducible gene expression signatures in clinical samples taken from adults with asthma or COPD vs. controls.

Measurements and main results: 

The mean post-supplementation 25(OH)D increase in participants with 

* asthma (20.9 nmol/L) and 

* COPD (21.5 nmol/L) was lower than in 

* controls (39.8 nmol/L; P=0.001). 

Compared with controls, patients with asthma and COPD had lower molar ratios of 25(OH)D3-to-vitamin D3 and higher molar ratios of 1α,25(OH)2D3-to-25(OH)D3 both pre- and post-supplementation (P≤0.005). Inter-group differences in 1α,25<span>[OH]</span>2D3-inducible gene expression signatures were modest and variable where statistically significant.

Conclusions: Attenuation of the 25(OH)D response to vitamin D supplementation in asthma and COPD associated with reduced molar ratios of 25(OH)D3-to-vitamin D3 and increased molar ratios of 1α,25(OH)2D3-to-25(OH)D3 in serum, suggesting that vitamin D metabolism is dysregulated in these conditions.

#### 4 studies of Asthma and gut (Bifidobacterium infantis 35,624  helps - it is on Amazon)

 **The Role of the Microbiome in Asthma: The Gut–Lung Axis - Dec 2018** 

Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan; 20(1): 123 online 2018 Dec 30. [doi: 10.3390/ijms20010123](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20010123) FREE PDF

Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide. It affects all ages but frequently begins in childhood. Initiation and exacerbations may depend on individual susceptibility, viral infections, allergen exposure, tobacco smoke exposure, and outdoor air pollution. The aim of this review was to analyze the role of the gut–lung axis in asthma development, considering all asthma phenotypes, and to evaluate whether microbe-based therapies may be used for asthma prevention. Several studies have confirmed the role of microbiota in the regulation of immune function and the development of atopy and asthma. These clinical conditions have apparent roots in an insufficiency of early life exposure to the diverse environmental microbiota necessary to ensure colonization of the gastrointestinal and/or respiratory tracts. Commensal microbes are necessary for the induction of a balanced, tolerogenic immune system. The identification of commensal bacteria in both the gastroenteric and respiratory tracts could be an innovative and important issue. In conclusion, the function of microbiota in healthy immune response is generally acknowledged, and gut dysbacteriosis might result in chronic inflammatory respiratory disorders, particularly asthma. Further investigations are needed to improve our understanding of the role of the microbiome in inflammation and its influence on important risk factors for asthma, including tobacco smoke and host genetic features.

A type-2 immune response usually sustains wheezing and asthma in children. In addition, dysbiosis of digestive and respiratory tracts is detectable in patients with wheezing and asthma. Probiotics may rebalance immune response, repair dysbiosis, and mitigate airway inflammation. As a result, probiotics may prevent asthma and wheezing relapse. There is evidence that some probiotic strains may improve asthma outcomes in children. In this context, the PROPAM study provided evidence that two specific strains significantly prevented asthma exacerbations and wheezing episodes. Therefore, oral probiotics could be used as add-on asthma therapy in managing children with asthma, but the choice should be based on documented evidence.

"Very recently,  **Bifidobacterium infantis 35,624**  has been positively tested in asthmatic adults <sup>[16]</sup>. This study provided interesting results, as evidenced that this probiotic significantly improved asthma control in the subgroup of patients with initial uncontrolled asthma."
