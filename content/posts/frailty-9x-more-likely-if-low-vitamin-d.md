OBJECTIVE:

Since vitamin D is an important regulator of muscle function, the effect of vitamin D deficiency on frailty syndrome has been recently studied. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the association between 25(OH)-vitamin D levels and frailty status in Mexican community-dwelling elderly.

METHODS:

Sample of 331 community-dwelling elderly aged 70 or older, a subset of those included in the "Coyoacán cohort" were included. 25(OH)-vitamin D assay and frailty status were measured.

RESULTS:

Mean age was 79.3 years and 54.1% were women. Those classified as frail were more likely to have 

* lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (p = 0.015), 

* more disability for instrumental activities of daily living (p < 0.001) 

* and for activities of daily living (p < 0.001). 

Serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels were lower in the frail subgroup when compared with the non-frail one (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between intermediate tertile <span>[odds ratios (OR) = 4.13; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.00-8.56]</span> or insufficient tertile (OR = 8.95; 95% CI 2.41-33.30) of vitamin D levels and frailty even after adjusting for potential confounders.

CONCLUSION:

These results suggest that older adults with low 25(OH)-vitamin D levels are associated with the probability to being frail compared with those with sufficient vitamin D levels.
