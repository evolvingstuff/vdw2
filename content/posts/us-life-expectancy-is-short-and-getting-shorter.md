*Also, [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2802602|a paper] in the Journal of the American Medical Association %%% ~hs~~hs~ found __rising mortality rates among U.S. children and adolescents.__
*&quot;American __children are less likely to live to age 5__ than children in other high-income countries,&quot; the authors write on the second page. It goes on: &quot;Even Americans with healthy behaviors, 
**for example, those who are not obese or do not smoke, appear to have higher disease rates than their peers in other countries.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;If you add up the excess deaths that have occurred in the United States because of this unfolding problem, it dwarfs what happened during COVID-19,...&quot;
* However, &quot;the United States has higher survival after age 75 than do peer countries,...&quot;
__Reminder: in the US Big Pharma just has to show that a new drug is better than a placebo. %%%In many other countries a new drug must be more cost-effective than the existing drug.__
