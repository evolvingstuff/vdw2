 **Highlights** 

* Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to the progression of lethal prostate cancer.

* Vitamin D plays a complex role in prostate health and cancer, influencing cell growth, inflammation, and tumor progression.

* Evidence suggests a significant link between low vitamin D and aggressive, lethal prostate cancer, particularly in Black men.

* Black men face a double disparity: an elevated risk of both vitamin D deficiency and lethal forms of prostate cancer.

* Limitations in study design contribute to inconsistent results, potentially masking protective effects of vitamin D in prostate cancer.

Epidemiological data from as early as the 1930s documented a dramatic racial disparity in prostate cancer incidence, survival, and mortality rates among Black menâ€”a trend that persists to this day. Black men are disproportionately burdened by prostate cancer, developing the disease at younger ages, facing more aggressive and lethal forms, and ultimately experiencing double the mortality rate of men of European descent. Investigating the multifactorial contributors to this racial disparity has been extensive, but results have often been inconsistent or inconclusive, making it difficult to pinpoint clear correlations. However, there is strong evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with lethal forms of prostate cancer. This is particularly important given that Black men are at a higher risk for both vitamin D deficiency and developing aggressive, lethal prostate cancer, presenting a double disparity. The disparity in prostate cancer and vitamin D extends to Black men outside the US, but most of the studies have been done in African American men. Understanding the available evidence on vitamin D deficiency and its influence on prostate cancer biology may reveal new opportunities for prevention and therapeutic intervention.

#### Perplexity [Black Prostate Cancer](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-increased-risk-of-r72.gPQYSvG0AVsfVp8M5w) statistics

* 1 in 4 Black men developing prostate cancer - double the risk compared to other men.

* Black men have 60% higher incidence rates compared to white Americans

* Black men have a 44-75% higher risk of progression to metastatic disease

* Black men develop prostate cancer at a younger age, with diagnosis occurring approximately 3 years earlier than white men

* Black men are advised to begin PSA screening between ages 40 and 45
