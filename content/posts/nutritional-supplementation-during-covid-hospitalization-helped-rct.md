The COVID-19 evolution depends on immunological capacity. The global hospital mortality rate is 15-20%, but in México it is 46%. There are several therapeutic protocols, however, integral nutrition is not considered. In this study, a Nutritional Support System (NSS) was employed to increase survival and reduce mortality in patients with stage III COVID-19. A randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial was performed. Eighty patients (aged 30 to 75 years, both sexes) were assigned to (1) "Control Group" (CG) hospital diet and medical treatment or (2) "Intervention Group" (IG) hospital diet, medical treatment, and the NSS (vitamins, minerals, fiber, omega-3, amino acids, B- complex, and probiotics). IG significantly increased survival and reduced mortality compared to CG (p = 0.027).

IG 

* decreased progression to Mechanical Ventilation Assistance (MVA) by 10%, 

* reduced the intubation period by 15 days, and 

* inicreased survival in intubated patients by 38% compared to CG.

IG showed improvement compared to CG in 

* decrease in supplemental oxygen (p = 0.014), the 

* qSOFA test (p = 0.040), constipation (p = 0.014), the 

* PHQ-9 test (p = 0.003), and 

* in the follow-up, saturation with oxygen (p = 0.030). 

The NSS increases survival and decreases mortality in patients with stage III COVID-19.

The IG received the NSS, which consists in:

* (1) B-complex: 10 mg of cyanocobalamin, 100 mg of thiamin, and 100 mg of pyridoxine administered intramuscularly every 24 h for the first 5 days.

* ((2) NSS powder: one envelope orally after morning meals and another after evening meals, diluted in 400 mL of water each, during the whole intervention for a maximum of 21 days. Each envelope contained: 

   * Spirulina Maxima 2.5 g, folic acid 5 mg,glutamine 5 g, vegetable protein 10 g, constituted by two foods without processing or fragmenting in amino acids, 

   * brewer’s yeast, and 

   * amaranth, ascorbic acid 1 g, 

   * zinc 20 mg, 

   * selenium 100 mcg, 

   * cholecalciferol 2000 IU, 

   * resveratrol 200 mg

   * Omega-3 fattyacids 1 g

   * L-Arginine 750 mg, inulin 20 g, and

   * magnesium 400 mg.

* (3) Probiotics: Saccharomyces boulardii (SB) 500 mg daily for 6 days orally
