Context: There is still controversy over the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone health.

Objective: The effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone turnover, as well as the dose-response relationship between vitamin D3 and bone health in adults, were evaluated.

Data sources: The PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and AGRIS databases were searched for articles published through April 30, 2022. Thirty-nine of the 6409 records identified met the inclusion criteria.

Data extraction: Data were extracted from articles by 2 authors, and data extraction was cross-checked independently. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size and the associated 95%CI for the effect of vitamin D3 for each outcome. A one-stage random-effects dose-response model was used to estimate the dose-response relationship between vitamin D3 supplementation and BMD.

Data analysis: Results of meta-analysis showed a beneficial effect of vitamin D3 at the

* lumbar spine (standardized mean difference <span>[SMD]</span> = 0.06; 95%CI, 0.01-0.12) and 

* femoral neck (SMD = 0.25; 95%CI, 0.09-0.41). 

Dose-response analysis revealed a linear relationship between vitamin D3 supplementation doses and 

* BMD at the femoral neck,

* lumbar spine, and 

* total hip sites. 

No significant effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on whole-body or total hip BMD was observed (P > 0.05). Vitamin D3 supplementation significantly decreased BMD at both proximal and distal forearm (SMD = -0.16; 95%CI, -0.26 to -0.06). The variables of ethnicity, age, baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D), menopause status, vitamin D3 dosing frequency, and bone health status (P interaction = 0.02) altered the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on BMD. Additionally, a nonlinear relationship between vitamin D3 supplement doses and markers of bone turnover was found.

Conclusion: A protective effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip is implicated.

Introduction

The association between serum vitamin D levels and bone mineral density (BMD) varies by race and gender. This study aimed to evaluate this relationship between serum vitamin D levels and BMD, and changes of BMD over time in Korean women.

Materials and methods

We analyzed data from 586 generally healthy Korean women aged 29–79 who underwent health check-ups at Seoul National University Gangnam Center between 2010 and 2011 (baseline measurement) and 2015–2016 (follow-up). Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D) level measurements were conducted. We assessed the association between serum 25OH-D levels and BMD, as well as changes in BMD over time.

Results

The mean age of participants was 51.3 ± 7.9 years, with a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 ± 0.7 years, and mean serum 25OH-D level of 20.6 ± 8.5 ng/ml. Baseline serum 25OH-D levels did not correlate with BMD values at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total femur, nor with changes in BMD over time. A significant negative association was found between perimenopausal status and BMD changes at all sites, and between premenopausal status and lumbar bone mass, compared to postmenopausal status in the 25OH-D < 20 ng/ml group. This association was not observed in women with higher serum 25OH-D levels.

Conclusions

Serum 25OH-D levels did not correlate with BMD levels or changes in BMD overall. However, in late reproductive-aged and perimenopausal women with serum 25OH-D insufficiency, there was a significant association with accelerated bone loss.
