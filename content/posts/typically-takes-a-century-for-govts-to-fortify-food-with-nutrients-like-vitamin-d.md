#### Phases seem to typically be:

1. Detect association between nutrient and a health problem

1. Determine that the lack of the nutrient is a major cause of the health problem

1. Individuals and companies supplement with the nutrient

1. Government recommends a minimum daily amount (RDA) of the nutrient

1. Government sometimes then fortifies food (milk, salt, bread, . . ) with a bare minimum amount of the nutrient

1. Government increases the amount of fortification a half century later due to one or more of the following

> Decreased use of the food (e.g. milk, salt) - note: Switzerland is the only country to have recently increased the amount of Iodine in salt

> Decrease in other sources of the nutrient (less sunshine ==> less Vitamin D)

> Decrease in cofactors needed with the nutrient (Magnesium)

#### Unfortunately uniform fortification ends using so little as to only partially help about 20% of the population

 **Often there is a concern that too much fortification will caused problems with some drugs (increase or decrease potency), or rare health problems** 

 **Very difficult to have one-size-fits all for anything: fortification, clothing, seats, shoes, eye glass intensity, size of print, calories, hearing aids, etc.**

> Currently, the federal government requires that manufacturers enrich cereal-grain products with five nutrients—iron and the vitamins thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), and folate (B9). The total cost to U.S. consumers of adding calcium and vitamin D to the list should be no more than about $19 million a year, Harold L. Newmark of Rutgers University and his colleagues report in the August American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 

> Calcium and Vitamin D would add an estimated 6 to 10 cents to the cost of food per person per year—or collectively some $19 million. 

> The team contrasts that amount with the annual savings of averting some 300,000 fractures ($2 billion) and preventing some 27,000 cases of colon cancer (more than $1 billion).
