#### Changes in choroidal tissue post-supplementation with vitamin D in pediatric patients who are deficient in vitamin D

Int Ophthalmol . 2023 Jul 3. [doi: 10.1007/s10792-023-02787-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-023-02787-y)

 **3 months after a single oral dose of 300,000 IU = 7.5 milligrams** 

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

Purpose: To quantitatively assess the choroidal structural parameters of patients in the pediatric age group who were deficient in vitamin D <span>[Vit-D]</span> pre- and post-treatment.

Design: Prospective, case-control study.

Methods: Choroidal structural parameters, including the choroidal thickness (CT) at five points,

1.  total choroidal area (TA), 

1. luminal choroidal area (LA), 

1. stromal choroidal area (SA), and

1.  choroidal vascular index (CVI), 

in patients in the pediatric age group who were deficient in Vit-D, in Group 1, and those who were not, in Group 2, were compared. The patients were divided into 3 different groups according to how deficient in Vit-D they were. This was re-evaluated after treatment.

Results: Group 1 consisted of 83 patients and group 2 consisted of 85 patients. CT at all five points, and the TA, SA, LA, and CVI, were lower in Group 1. And for all of these, a significant increase was seen post-treatment. While a significant increase was observed in all of the values in the group with the most severe deficiency in Vit-D, significant changes were observed in the TA, LA, SA, and CVI values in the group that was mildly deficient in Vit-D. There was no significant post-treatment value in the CT values (except for the Temporal 1500 CT <span>[P = 0.012]</span>).

Conclusion: Decreases in the CT, TA, LA, SA, and CVI were among the structural changes that were seen to occur in the pediatric patient group that was deficient in Vit-D. Moreover, thinning of the choroid and a decrease in the CVI were the most significant in the group with the greatest Vit-D deficiency.

!!!!Changes in choroidal tissue post-supplementation with vitamin D in pediatric patients who are deficient in vitamin D

__3 months after a single oral dose of 300,000 IU = 7.5 milligrams__
{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;19742&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;}

Purpose: To quantitatively assess the choroidal structural parameters of patients in the pediatric age group who were deficient in vitamin D [Vit-D] pre- and post-treatment.

Design: Prospective, case-control study.

Methods: Choroidal structural parameters, including the choroidal thickness (CT) at five points,
# total choroidal area (TA), 
#luminal choroidal area (LA), 
#stromal choroidal area (SA), and
# choroidal vascular index (CVI), 
in patients in the pediatric age group who were deficient in Vit-D, in Group 1, and those who were not, in Group 2, were compared. The patients were divided into 3 different groups according to how deficient in Vit-D they were. This was re-evaluated after treatment.

Results: Group 1 consisted of 83 patients and group 2 consisted of 85 patients. CT at all five points, and the TA, SA, LA, and CVI, were lower in Group 1. And for all of these, a significant increase was seen post-treatment. While a significant increase was observed in all of the values in the group with the most severe deficiency in Vit-D, significant changes were observed in the TA, LA, SA, and CVI values in the group that was mildly deficient in Vit-D. There was no significant post-treatment value in the CT values (except for the Temporal 1500 CT [P = 0.012]).

Conclusion: Decreases in the CT, TA, LA, SA, and CVI were among the structural changes that were seen to occur in the pediatric patient group that was deficient in Vit-D. Moreover, thinning of the choroid and a decrease in the CVI were the most significant in the group with the greatest Vit-D deficiency.
