#### Off-label uses of topical vitamin d in dermatology: a systematic review - 2014

J Cutan Med Surg. 2014 Mar 1;18(2):91-108.

Wat H, Dytoc M.

Background:Topical vitamin D is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of psoriasis but is also used off-label in the treatment of a variety of cutaneous diseases despite a lack of evidence-based guidelines.

Objective:The objective of this study was to provide evidence-based clinical guidelines for the off-label use of topical vitamin D in the treatment of dermatologic disease.Methods:A systematic literature review was conducted via the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases for off-label uses of topical vitamin D analogues in the treatment of dermatologic disease other than psoriasis. The data were synthesized, and evidence-based recommendations were rendered according to the highest level of evidence available.

Results:A total of 165 articles met the inclusion criteria. 

A moderate to strong recommendation was given for the use of 

* topical vitamin D in combination with corticosteroids and phototherapy in vitiligo and as 

* monotherapy for various 

> ichthyoses, <span>[dry, scaling skin that may be thickened or very thin]</span>

> morphea,  <span>[ isolated patches of hardened skin]</span>

> pityriasis alba, <span>[dry, fine-scaled, pale patches on the face]</span>

> prurigo nodularis, <span>[(itchy) nodules which usually appear on the arms or legs]</span> and  

> polymorphous light eruption. <span>[itchy rash caused by sun exposure in people who have developed a sensitivity to sunlight]</span>

There is evidence showing that topical vitamin D is  **ineffective**  in the treatment of 

* actinic keratosis, 

* seborrheic keratosis, <span>[premalignant condition of thick, scaly, or crusty patches of skin.]</span>

* lichen planus, 

* seborrheic dermatitis, 

* alopecia areata, c

* hemotherapy-induced alopecia, and 

* hypertrophic scars.

Conclusion:Topical vitamin D analogues have an important role in the off-label treatment of dermatologic disease, but higher quality studies are still required.

 **Note: For some people the vitamin D levels were DECREASED** 

 **Note: Vitamin D levels can be decreased for oral Vitamin D supplementation as well for some people**

OBJECTIVE: The intent of this study was to test the effect of Top-D, a topical Vitamin D preparation, in delivering vitamin D.

METHODS:

Five hundred and fifty healthy patients, with vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were recruited after written informed consent. Demographic data was recorded, adequate history and clinical examination was done to rule out any metabolic diseases. Complete blood picture, serum calcium, phosphorous, Parathormone and 25 Hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25OHD) was carried out before enrollment of the patients. Patients were divided randomly into two groups 350 in study group and 200 in the control group. Patients in the study group were given Top-D (Vitamin D3 gel made from proniosomal technology) to apply daily on the skin. Top-D 1 g contained 5000 IU of vitamin D3. The control group was given 1 g of Aloe vera gel to be applied every day. The two groups had no knowledge to which group they belong. After 4 months serum 25OHD was tested again.

RESULTS: Three hundred and forty five patients in study group and 192 in control group completed the study. The mean age of the patients in the both the groups was 42 years (18-80 years). The pretreatment 25OHD level in the study group was 11.03 ± 4.57 (2-12) ng/l compared to the control group 10.36 ± 4.09 (2-21) and post treatment the levels were 37.17 ± 6.04 (12-54) ng/ml and 10.51 ± 3.5 (2-19) ng/ml (p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that transdermal route of vitamin D is potentially, safe and can give desired results to raise the vitamin D levels. This route is an alternate route for supplementation of vitamin D which should be utilized.

#### Seborrheic Keratoses treated by topical Vitamin D, etc. - Nov 2017

 **Managing Seborrheic Keratoses: Evolving Strategies for Optimizing Patient Outcomes.** 

J Drugs Dermatol. 2017 Nov 1;16(11):1064-1068. PMID: 29141054

Ranasinghe GC, Friedman AJ.

The seborrheic keratosis is the most common benign skin tumor of middle-aged and elderly adults, affecting nearly 83 million individuals in the US alone. Although these are benign lesions, many patients still undergo some form of treatment. Clinicians are frequently presented with a challenge when determining whether to remove a seborrheic keratosis, and which treatment modality to use when doing so. The most commonly used method of removal is cryotherapy, however there are numerous other options that can be employed with varying degrees of efficacy. In this article, we highlight the use of topical keratolytics, vitamin D analogues, and lasers, to name a few. We also address potential side effects associated with these treatment options, as well as discuss patients' preferences and concerns. We conclude with the most recent advances in topical treatments currently under clinical investigation, and offer treatment strategies aimed at maximizing patient satisfaction.

Vitamin D deficiency has high prevalence worldwide. Vitamin D3, the active form of vitamin D, exhibits array of roles in body, from calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization to cancer, neurological disorders, immunomodulatory action, and cardiac health. Current approaches for supplementing vitamin D3 are restricted to oral and parenteral routes. This review highlights recent research in the field of transdermal delivery of vitamin D, its active form and analogues with the aid of penetration enhancers and novel carrier system as nutritional supplement in case of vitamin D deficiency. The penetration of vitamin D3 is challenging; however, by means of  **reducing hydrophobicity of the active and encapsulating vitamin D3 in a suitable carrier system, penetration is achieved** . The results show that penetration of vitamin D3 through skin is feasible. Further clinical trials could strengthen these results. However, the present research till date shows transdermal vitamin D3 a promising way of supplementation.
