#### 50 IU of Vitamin D per pound of dog (helps blood in this study) - May 2024

 **A study on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on hematological parameters and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D in healthy dogs** 

BMC Vet Res . 2024 May 24;20(1):221. [doi: 10.1186/s12917-024-04080-1.](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-024-04080-1.)

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/50iu-per-kg-of-dog.webp" alt="image" width="400">

Background: Limited studies are available on vitamin D supplementation in dogs. This study evaluates the effect of a commercial vitamin D3 supplement on serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D as well as selected biochemical and hematological parameters in healthy dogs. Eight intact male adult dogs with a mean body weight of 20 kg from mixed breeds were included in the study. After adaptation period, dogs received vitamin D3 supplement at the dose of 50 IU/kg body weight per day. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 14, 28 and 42 of supplementation. Food was used for analysis of vitamin D3 content.

Results: Significant increase in serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was detected since day 14 of supplementation.

Changes in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 concentration during time showed an upward significance (p < 0.05).

Vitamin D3 content of the food was 2900 IU/kg dry matter.

Changes in serum phosphorus levels were upward significant.

No dog showed calcium or phosphorus levels above the highest reference level.

Liver and kidney parameters remained in the reference range during the experiment.

A gradual significant increase was observed in hemoglobin and hematocrit which was started from day 14. Vitamin D3 supplementation had no significant effect on neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes percent during the study.

Conclusions: Vitamin D3 supplementation at 50 IU/kg BW daily, increases serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in healthy dogs fed with a diet containing proper amount of this vitamin. It also increases hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in a time dependent manner without inducing adverse effects.

#### Might vitamin D improve the health and life of pet cats? - asked Perplexity AI June 2024

Based on the search results, vitamin D appears to play an important role in the health of pet cats. Here are some key points about how vitamin D may improve the health and life of cats:

1. Cats cannot synthesize vitamin D through sun exposure like humans can, so they are entirely dependent on dietary sources of vitamin D. This makes ensuring adequate vitamin D intake through diet crucial for cats.

1. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health in cats. A deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets in kittens.

1. Beyond bone health, vitamin D has been linked to various other health benefits in cats:

   * It may help prevent heart disease and congestive heart failure

   * It supports immune function and may help prevent infectious diseases

   * It may play a role in cancer prevention

   * It's important for muscle function and strength

1. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and other health issues in cats.

1. Supplementing vitamin D in appropriate amounts may help prevent or manage some of these health conditions. However, the optimal levels are not well established for adult cats.

1. Commercial cat foods are formulated to provide adequate vitamin D, but homemade diets may increase the risk of deficiency.

1. Vitamin D status can be assessed through blood tests, and supplementation should be done under veterinary guidance to avoid toxicity.

In summary, ensuring cats receive appropriate levels of vitamin D through diet or supplements under veterinary supervision may improve their overall health, bone strength, immune function, and potentially reduce the risk of certain diseases. However, more research is needed to fully understand optimal vitamin D levels and supplementation strategies for adult cats.

 **[The Offbeat Reason Why Cats and Dogs Lay In The Sun and Lick Their Fur](https://antranik.org/the-offbeat-reason-why-cats-and-dogs-lay-in-the-sun-and-lick-their-fur/%20)** 

* "Dogs and cats secrete the same oily cholesterol from their skin, just like us.  When they lay in the sun, that oil is, again, converted to Vitamin D3.  The difference, however, is that because they have so much hair, the vitamin ends up on their fur and doesn’t get absorbed through their skin."

* " Oh and by the way, I mention cats and dogs, but this info applies to ALL furry mammals and also to birds."

#### Vitamin D in Health and Disease in Dogs and Cats Nov 2020

 **Key points** 

* 25-hydroxyvitamin D is not a sensitive indicator of vitamin D status in dogs and cats.

* Food intake and food ingredient analysis are often absent in studies on vitamin D in dogs and cats.

* 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the most potent vitamin D metabolite with the greatest binding affinity to the vitamin D receptor.

* Determination of other vitamin D metabolites rather than 25-hydroxyvitamin D in vitamin D studies will provide better insight in cause-effect relationships.
