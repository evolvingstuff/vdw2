#### Story at-a-glance

* Members in the European Parliament (MEPs) announced that Monsanto officials would no longer be able to meet MEPs or attend committee meetings, essentially banning them from parliament

* The blow came after the biotech giant refused to attend a hearing over allegations that Monsanto inappropriately influenced studies into the safety of glyphosate

* A ruling over whether or not to relicense glyphosate in the EU is expected by the end of 2017, which means the ban could not have come at a more inopportune time for Monsanto

 **Clipps from the article** 

* “Widespread Monsanto Manipulation Coming to the Surface”

* “You Can Find Out How Much Glyphosate Is in Your Body”

> “The analysis revealed glyphosate in levels of 76 μg/L to 166 μg/L in women's breast milk. As reported by The Detox Project, this is  **760 to 1,600 times higher than the EU-permitted level in drinking water** ”

> “In the study, 15 percent of the administered glyphosate reached the fetal compartment”

* “In the case of glyphosate, it’s also wise to avoid desiccated crops like wheat and oats”

> Note: [Crops desiccated with Glyphosate are allowed to be called organic](http://non-gmoreport.com/articles/grim-reaper-many-food-crops-sprayed-with-weed-killer-before-harvest/)

   * [Desiccation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_desiccation) Maize, Cereals, Oilseed rape, Legumes, Sunflower. Potatoes. etc

   * Organic = Non GMO crops, and no herbicides were used while  **growing** 

   * Lobbing money is very powerful!
