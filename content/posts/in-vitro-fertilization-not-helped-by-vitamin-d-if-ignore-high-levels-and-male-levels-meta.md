VitaminDWiki bought the PDF (~$40) to find out how they disagreed with all previous studies

1. The study decided ahead of time that 20 nanograms should be enough 

> (China believes that 20 ng is enough for anything, but really need a minimum of 30 ng)

1. The study ignored male vitamin D levels – which are similarly important

1. 4 of the 5 studies chosen showed a significant benefit with higher vitamin D

> But: 1 study did not show a benefit 

> it had 10 times fewer controls than the other studies (and is behind a paywall)

OBJECTIVE:

To assess the correlation between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> status and outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in infertile women through review systematically.

METHODS:

We used Embase, Pubmed, and Cochrane database to identify all studies that assessed the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and IVF outcomes in infertile women up until 30 June 2015, with the restricted language of English. We included studies that compared IVF outcomes between infertile women vitamin D <20 ng/ml and vitamin D ≥20 ng/ml. The results were summarized using Stata 12.0 software. For studies reported dichotomous outcomes (clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate), we pooled the relative risks ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) in a random effects model.

RESULTS:

Our search resulted in the retrieval and screening of 134 studies. Of those, five studies were included in our meta-analysis. The risk for lower clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly increased in the deficient group (RR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.69-1.11). Lower vitamin D status was associated with lower live birth rate (RR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.61-0.93).

CONCLUSION:

There is no significant correlation between deficient serum vitamin D level and lower clinical pregnancy rate in infertile woman undergoing in vitro fertilization. On the other hand, deficient vitamin D level was related to lower live birth rate.
