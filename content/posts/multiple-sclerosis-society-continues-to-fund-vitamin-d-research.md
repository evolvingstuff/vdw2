"A team led by Anne-Louise Ponsonby at the Australian National University was also given support. These researchers will examine how the environment — including exposure to sunlight, vitamin D, and infections — might impact genes and possibly trigger disease onset."

Anne-Louise Ponsonby, PhD, The Australian National University. Canberra, Australia

Award: Research Grant Term: 10/1/18-9/30/21 Funding:  **$555,546** 

Title: Identifying epigenetic factors involved in MS onset: utilizing population-based studies with genetic and environmental measures. Summary: Researchers at the Australian National University are studying a link between the environment and how genes are turned on and off to trigger the onset of MS.

Background: The cause of MS is complex and not fully understood, but is thought to involve the interaction between an individual’s genes and environmental factors, such as exposure to sunlight,  **vitamin D**  or infections. This research will take advantage of a large population study (the Australian-based Ausimmune Study) that was established to track MS triggering factors.
