# Snips

## Protects against cancer by

* Increasing the self-destruction of mutated cells (which, if allowed to replicate, could lead to cancer)

* Reducing the spread and reproduction of cancer cells

* Causing cells to become differentiated (cancer cells often lack differentiation)

* Reducing the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, which is a step in the transition of dormant tumors turning cancerous

## Protect Against Sunburn with 2 mg daily of astaxanthin

^~~#090:Note:A quick search on internet found many such claims, as well as a patent, but not a single scientific study. 

There was not, for example, a single hit in PubMed for astaxanthin and sunscreen or sunburn.

Noticed that Mercola sells an astaxanthin product (1900 hits on the internet)

Did find mention of its being an effective internal sunscreen – wonder if it blocks the creation of vitamin D as well

I have been taking astaxanthin for years to protect against eye damage. ~~^

## How much to take?

Readers Digest 1,000 IU

Many experts say 35 IU’s of vitamin D per pound of body weight

## Has a clickable list of diseases prevented by Vitamin D:
