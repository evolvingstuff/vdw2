Background: 

There is accumulating evidence that Vitamin D deficiency contributes to the occurrence of stroke, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. However, the relationship between Vitamin D levels and the risk of hemorrhage stroke was less conclusive.

Aim: 

This prospective study is aimed for relationship between Vitamin D status and specific nonlobar hemorrhagic stroke in a Taiwanese cohort.

Methods: 

A prospective study of 44 adult patients (32 males and 12 females; 27 aged <65 years and 17 ≥65 years) with acute nonlobar spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) was undertaken for 24 months (December 2017–November 2019) in a general reference teaching hospital. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) level was examined within 1 day of the stroke. The associations between Vitamin D status, age, low-density lipoprotein levels, and hemorrhagic stroke were analyzed using the Chi-squared test for comparisons. Statistical significance was set atP< 0.05.

Results: 

The mean serum concentration of (25(OH) D) was 20.30 ng/ml. There were 14 patients with Vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/ml), and 23 with Vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml). There was no age dependence to the Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in patients with acute nonlobar sICH. We also found no significant correlation between Vitamin D deficiency and low-density lipoprotein concentration.

Conclusion: 

A particularly high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency was found in Taiwanese patients with specific hemorrhagic stroke, acute nonlobar sICH, and this was independent of age or serum low-density lipoprotein levels.
