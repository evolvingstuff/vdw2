Beau is a Border Collie Cross, 17 years old, weighing in at 20kg.</p><p>He is living in Iligan City, Philippines where I was a service volunteer for 8 years.</p><p>Unfortunately he can never leave, govt regulations.</p><p>In 2008, I Robert Powrie, Beaus owner was helping the local university reduce their power consumption. We were also improving air quality using Ionizers.</p><p>These were normally fitted to out-flowing air on A/C, however we fitted units to fans in our house to clean our air up.</p><p>The first thing we noticed was Beau, who was showing signs of respiratory difficulty, was always near the fan that had an ioniser fitted.</p><p>Any problems he had were non-existent when it was on, the ioniser certainly helped his breathing.</p><p>However as time progressed his breathing progressively got worse with the ioniser being of a minor help.</p><p>When I came back to the Philippines in April 2011, his condition was much worse. I had bought whilst in NZ, a supplement to assist his breathing. It was no help, but I had used Vitamin D to help local asthmatics. The city vet had diagnosed Beaus condition as asthma & suggested I get him an inhaler, but seeing you have to hold your breath to make an inhaler work properly, I considered that was impossible to administer one effectively. Plus he still had big teeth & I am always wary of any dogs bite, different things can set them off. I had with me some VitD3 that I was personally using & sharing with others nearby. I decided to try the VitD.</p><p>Initially the tablets didn’t work, mainly thru the capsules not dissolving in his stomach. I then released the powder into his bowl, mixing a little milk so he could drink it. I found that to actually work, <strong>4000 iu</strong> had to be administered. Any less and the attack did not stop. <strong>4000 iu</strong> provided him with nearly 24 hours protection. The attacks normally came at about 8pm, when temperatures had dropped about 5-6 deg C. Sometimes the attack came after midnight when I was asleep & Beau would wake me seeking help. Every time 4000iu improved his breathing.</p><p>Without the Vitamin D assistance I’m sure he would be dead. The attacks stop almost as soon as he has finished drinking the mix, it is truly amazing.</p><p>We have continued a Vitamin D supplement of 4000iu per day. I approached a New York company & they made me a water soluble VitD3 mix to my specs which he is given daily, sprayed onto his food. We monitor him closely, he truly is a family friend.</p><p>Other things happened to him. He was becoming very lazy, getting him outside to the toilet was very difficult, he slept nearly all the time. His hearing & sense of smell was non-existent. He was already blind from cataracts & his coat looked like a worn out rug. It was time, we thought to put him down.</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>But things slowly changed. His coat started to look good again, he can hear again & his sense of smell is back</span>.</strong></p><p>We know about his smell, he knows where cats are. He has regained his energy, he’s first to the kitchen when food is about.</p><p>He wants my nephews to take him for walks, it’s like he’s a new dog.</p><p>His coat is all lush now, no-one believes he is over 18 years old, 19 in August (2012).</p><p>Many friends have asked for some of the VitD mix I was sent from NY.</p><p>I’m currently talking with them & will be able to supply others. I will tell you when I have more.</p><hr><h3 id=notes>Notes</h3><ul><li><p>Cows are routinely given 30 IU per kilogram (which would be 4,000 IU for a 60 lb dog)</p></li><li><p>Can probably add vitamin D drops to the pet food</p></li><li><p>Probably should not continue to give 4000 IU - It is OK for a loading dose daily amount for several months, but not longer.</p></li></ul><hr><h4 id=on-the-web-may-18-2012>On the web May 18 2012</h4><p>Do you have any thoughts on the effect of keeping animals totally out of the sun?</p><p>I’m talking about our cats and dogs who are kept indoors “for their protection”.</p><p>This story isn’t over yet, but my cat seemed intent on dying <span>[not eating, trips to the vet ($500+)]</span>,</p><p>so just because he seemed to enjoy it, we started spending a lot of time outdoors.</p><p>I was so sure he was close to death, we prepared his grave a week ago.</p><p>Now he’s greatly improved, but still on shaky ground</p><p>– after all he ate nothing for two weeks!</p><p>But could this possibly be from simply taking him outside?</p><p>(Vitamin D from the sun helps too)</p><hr><h4 id=see-also-vitamindwiki>See also VitaminDWiki</h4><ul><li><a href=/posts/dog-cancer-4x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d>Dog Cancer 4X more likely if low Vitamin D – Nov 2015</a></li></ul><blockquote><blockquote><p>Includes vitamin D level in blood vs brand of dog food</p></blockquote></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/rickets-increasing-in-dogs>Rickets increasing in dogs</a></p></li><li><p><a href=http://pandemicsurvivor.com/2012/04/23/vitamin-d-for-your-dog-a-beagles-happy-days/>Vitamin D for Your Dog – A Beagle’s Happy Days</a> April 2012 by Vitamin D Survivor</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Dog age 10 was in some pain and moving slowly</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>20 to 40 IU per pound of body weight per day</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Clinical symptoms of vitamin D toxicity in dogs have been found as low as 3 mg/kg or 1.3 mg/lb.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Played with the new puppy and enjoyed another happy 5 years.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/companion-animals-dog-cats-need-vitamin-d-too>Companion animals (dog, cats) need vitamin D too – March 2016</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/dogs-like-humans-need-vitamin-d-for-many-reasons>Dogs, like humans, need vitamin D for many reasons – Jan 2018</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/dogs-with-cancer-have-low-vitamin-d-same-as-humans>Dogs with Cancer have low vitamin D, same as humans – Sept 2017</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/dog-cancer-hemangiosarcoma-is-rare-if-more-than-100-ng-of-vitamin-d>Dog Cancer (hemangiosarcoma) is rare if more than 100 ng of vitamin D – July 2014</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/half-of-dogs-now-get-cancer-it-used-to-be-just-1-percent-probably-low-vitamin-d>Half of dogs now get cancer, it used to be just 1 percent (probably low Vitamin D)</a></p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>asthma</span>
