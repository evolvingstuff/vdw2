#### NASAFYTOL® supplementation in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection: results from an exploratory open-label randomized controlled trial

Front. Nutr. 10:1137407. [doi: 10.3389/fnut.2023.1137407](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1137407)

Jean Gérain1, Melanie Uebelhoer2*, Bérénice Costes2, Julie Herman2, Sandra Pietri2, Anne-Françoise Donneau3, Justine Monseur3 and Yves Henrotin2   Belgium

#####  <span style="color:orange;">25 people got Curcumin (42 mg), Quercetin (65 mg), Vitamin D (90 IU) daily</span>

<img src="/attachments/d3.mock.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

Objectives: The effect and safety of Nasafytol®, a food supplement combining curcumin, quercetin, and Vitamin D, on hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients as support to standard of care were to be assessed.

Methods: This exploratory, open-label, randomized, controlled trial was carried out among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection. Participants were randomly assigned to receive Nasafytol® or Fultium® control. The improvement of the clinical condition and occurrence of (serious) adverse events were evaluated. The study was registered on clincaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT04844658.

Results: Twenty-five patients received Nasafytol®, and 24 received Fultium®. Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the groups. On day 14 (or at hospital leave if <14days), no difference was observed between groups regarding their clinical condition, fever, or the need of oxygen therapy. 

At day 7, however, 

* 19 participants had been discharged from the hospital in the Nasafytol® arm compared to 

* 10 participants in the Fultium® arm. 

* No participants were transferred to the ICU or died in the Nasafytol® arm, vs. 

* 4 transfers and 1 death in the Fultium® arm. 

The clinical condition of participants in the Nasafytol® arm had improved, as evidenced by a decrease in the COVID-19 WHO score. Interestingly, five SAEs occurred with Fultium®, while no SAE was observed with Nasafytol®.

Conclusion: Supplementation with Nasafytol®, in addition to standard-of-care treatment, led to a faster discharge from the hospital, improved clinical conditions of participants, and a reduced risk of serious outcomes, including transfer to the intensive care unit or death, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

!!!!NASAFYTOL® supplementation in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 infection: results from an exploratory open-label randomized controlled trial
Front. Nutr. 10:1137407. doi: 10.3389/fnut.2023.1137407

!!!!!~~#00F:25 people got Curcumin (42 mg), Quercetin (65 mg), Vitamin D (90 IU) daily~~
{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;19694&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;}
Objectives: The effect and safety of Nasafytol®, a food supplement combining curcumin, quercetin, and Vitamin D, on hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients as support to standard of care were to be assessed.

Methods: This exploratory, open-label, randomized, controlled trial was carried out among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection. Participants were randomly assigned to receive Nasafytol® or Fultium® control. The improvement of the clinical condition and occurrence of (serious) adverse events were evaluated. The study was registered on clincaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT04844658.

Results: Twenty-five patients received Nasafytol®, and 24 received Fultium®. Demographic characteristics were well balanced between the groups. On day 14 (or at hospital leave if &lt;14days), no difference was observed between groups regarding their clinical condition, fever, or the need of oxygen therapy. 
At day 7, however, 
*19 participants had been discharged from the hospital in the Nasafytol® arm compared to 
*10 participants in the Fultium® arm. 

*No participants were transferred to the ICU or died in the Nasafytol® arm, vs. 
*4 transfers and 1 death in the Fultium® arm. 
The clinical condition of participants in the Nasafytol® arm had improved, as evidenced by a decrease in the COVID-19 WHO score. Interestingly, five SAEs occurred with Fultium®, while no SAE was observed with Nasafytol®.

Conclusion: Supplementation with Nasafytol®, in addition to standard-of-care treatment, led to a faster discharge from the hospital, improved clinical conditions of participants, and a reduced risk of serious outcomes, including transfer to the intensive care unit or death, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
