 **Observation by Henry Lahore, Boeing comany Systems Engineer (retired) and Founder of VitaminDWiki** 

This is a good first step by one systems thinker

 **This model might need to consider many other parameters - such as** 

* Skin Color

* Season

* Cormodidities (Hypertension, Diabetes, etc) 

* Asymptomatic, Symptoms, Long Haul

* Evolution of the virus

* Mask use which benefits the wearer

* Limitation of resources: testing, hospital, vaccination, 

* Different age groups: aged, children

* Superspreaders

 **Next steps** 

* Decide where additional parameters might go on the diagram

* Make next version

* Assign some importance to each node and link

   * Example: larger font size or line width

* Make a simplified model for people

* Founder of VitaminDWiki believes that Causal Modeling will replace many RCTs in the future

   * BIG DATA is far faster and lower cost than  RCTs while being able to consider far more interactions

* Model A: 16 predictions match observed data; 3 predictions cannot be determined.

Clearly these charts can get far too complex to understand
