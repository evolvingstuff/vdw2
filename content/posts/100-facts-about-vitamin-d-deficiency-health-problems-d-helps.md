65|A recent study published in the "Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism" showed that of   
216 Covid-19 patients, 82.2% of them had too little vitamin D.

67|Those with low vitamin D are more likely to have high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity ,   
said Dr. Hans Konrad Biesalski, professor at the University of Hohenheim who compiled information about vitamin D and Covid-19.

68|The undersigned went with Professor Bruce W. Hollis from the Medical University of South Carolina, USA on 10OCT18 to a meeting with the National Medical Board in Iceland, which was invited by the National Medical Board .  
(has many e-mails to confirm this meeting and various e-mails to and from them.)  
The meeting lasted over an hour.   
There , the professor pointed out an error of more than 1000% on the website of the National Health Service regarding vitamin D. He instructed them to fix this.   
It still hasn't been done today, almost 3 years later (23APR21).   
The Department of Health is conducting a double-blind study that the professor was in charge of and pointed out .  
on 22APR21 can be seen when looking up on the Internet:  
[https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/frettir/frett/item21468/Nyir-radlagdir-dagskammtar-(RDS)-fyrir-vitamin-og-steinefni](https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/frettir/frett/item21468/Nyir-radlagdir-dagskammtar-(RDS)-fyrir-vitamin-og-steinefni)Iceland has adopted the Nordic recommended daily intake (RDS) for vitamins and minerals with the only exception that values for vitamin D are..."  
There is incorrect information on the website of the National Health Service that does not seem to be corrected .  
Among the things that Professor Bruce W. Hollis has researched specifically, is the vitamin D requirement of pregnant women, where it is stated, among other things, that the guidelines of the  **IOM** (  **Institute** of Medicine  **) and** the National Medical Board are wrong - and need to be corrected as soon as possible!   
If you follow the advice of the  **National Health Service** , 76% of the mothers will be included  
Vitamin D deficiency and 81% of the children are born .   
This needs to be corrected and immediately   
This was first pointed out to the National Health Service on 24MAÍ18 .  
Repeated 31JUL18 10 OCT 19 and 10 OCT 20 ,  
but has not yet been corrected on its website .  
(5 questions were asked, but not answered.)  
%However, they offered to meet with me / us after they were informed that this would be published in the media.  
   
From the website of the National Health Service:  
 ***                                                 * ***   
 **Table 1. Recommended daily allowances (RDS) for vitamin D**   
*From 1-2 weeks of age, it is recommended to give to infants  
Vitamin D drops (10 μg/day).  
   
In a section called "Diet during pregnancy" it says:  
Recommended Daily Allowance  **(RDS) for pregnant and lactating women is 15 micrograms (µg) (600**   **international units) per day** and is therefore recommended to eat as well  
Vitamin D-rich products, eg fatty fish and vitamin D-fortified milk.  
   
 **Pregnant women are advised not to take higher doses** than RDS except in consultation with a doctor. So if fish oil is taken as a food supplement, there is no need to take it at the same time  
Vitamin D in tablet form.  
 ***                                                 * ***   
Incorrect information or lack of knowledge must be corrected.  
   
It is safe to say that Professor Hollis is one of the four leaders in this field in the world today.  
 ****   
 **example**  **, it has been found that pregnant women do NOT need 600 IU as recommended by the above-mentioned authorities, but at least 6400 IU**  **.**   
   
For example, the recommended daily dose of vitamin D for 71 years and older is 800  
IU  
   
Ask yourself now:  
   
Why does Antony Fauci, the US Epidemiologist take 6000 IU of vitamin D daily or approx. 750% more than the National Health Service's recommended daily dose?  
(he takes as much as a pregnant woman needs).  
   
Should he not be in danger according to National doctor?  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqZLMoLvhgk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqZLMoLvhgk)Professor Michael F. Holick, who has studied vitamin D for more than 40 years , also takes 6000 IU daily and has done for years.  
   
He's not dead yet because of this vitamin D.  
   
Isn't the professor a little strange not to follow the recommendations of the National Health Service in Iceland?  
   
Isn't it normal and self-evident that the National Medical Examiner himself, Alma Dagbjört Möller, sent him a warning letter about a far too high dose of  
Vitamin D?  
   
Isn't it also obvious that Alma sent the US epidemiologist a warning letter about his excessive intake of vitamin D - because of course Alma knows much more about vitamin D than this American epidemiologist and this world-famous Professor Michel F. Holick - because he has only studied D -vitamins for “only” 40 years+”?  
   
Can't we trust that Alma will send them a warning letter, especially now that she has been alerted to this dangerous intake of these scientists?  
   
Will she not be able to save their lives when she sends them the warning letters?  
   
It is worth noting that Icelandic doctor Guðmundur Karl Snæbjörnsson has publicly stated on Facebook that he takes 6000-8000 IU of vitamin D daily .  
   
I don't think Alma will strip him of his medical license if she sees that he takes approx. 1000% more than Alma says is the recommended daily allowance? (she can see this on Facebook)  
   
It is planned that the above facts will be published regularly on Facebook, but a copy of this will be sent by e-mail to the National Medical Board so that Alma can now save these American scientists from excessive vitamin D consumption and send them a clipping from the National Medical Board's website so that they do not to hell  
   
In particular, it should be noted that the National Health Service still advises Icelanders to:  
 1)Wash and/or sanitize your hands2)Keep a distance of at least 2 meters from other people.3)Wear face masks.  
   
Has the Director of Health or his staff advised Icelanders to take vitamin D, when it is known that 100% of Icelandic children have too little vitamin D and a study from 2004 shows that all Icelanders also have too little vitamin D?  
   
(Wasn't the Swedish Transport Agency or the Traffic Council advertising: "buckle your seat belts"? Has the Swedish National Health Service advertised something similar?)  
   
Doctor Guðmundur Karl Snæbjörnsson has pointed out the importance of vitamin D due to Covid-19 to the National Health Service - BUT - yes BUT what?  
   
The examples show that even though one of the most respected professors in the US went to a meeting of the National Health Service and pointed out the importance of vitamin D and false information on the National Health Service website, it has no effect!  
   
The question is what causes?  
   
Does anyone know?  
   
In the end, it should be pointed out that Professor Michael F. Holick said in one of his talks that was published and is on YouTube that he had published a number of articles in the most prestigious Medical Journals in the world - - - - BUT almost no response.   
However, when an article about his research was published in a gossip magazine in Hollywood, he had received more than 20,000 written inquiries and phone calls with 5 sec. interval.  
( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiGBVDcbFVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiGBVDcbFVk)<span style="color:#000000;"> </span>  
See from 53 min + 40 sec. and until 55 min. + 23 sec.)   
He pointed out in his lecture that there was no point in bringing this knowledge to medical journals or doctors, it would be much better to educate the public!  
The general public passes on this knowledge, but NOT THE LAND MEDICAL DOCTORS AT ALL - maybe because those at the Landlækk know everything better?

then do not walk out of his doctor's office, but run!

The above researchers are without a doubt among those who have emerged with the most knowledge about vitamin D after a tremendous amount of selfless work and thought. I'm really surprised that they haven't won the Nobel Prize in Medicine yet.

{ANAME()}_GoBack{ANAME} **AT THE END** :  **===DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH VITAMIN D?===** 

You need to take 6201 IU of vitamin D3 daily to be fairly certain to reach a concentration of 75 nmol/L in the blood and 9122 IU to be fairly certain to reach 100 nmol/L .

Here it is based on adults and calculated by 2 mathematics professors in Canada, Paul J. Veugelers and John Paul Ekwaru.

The rule of thumb is this: Approx. 90 IU daily for each kg, i.e. an 80 kg person needs 80 x 90 = 7200 IU daily

(IU = International  **===Units ===** = AE  **==== International ===** Units  **===) ===** .

Since there is no risk of vitamin D poisoning (up to 15000 IU/day), this number can also be simplified and aimed at 100 instead of 90. That is 80 kg. you therefore need 80 x 100 = 8000 IU daily. 40 kg. a child therefore needs 40 x 100 = 4000 IU daily. Fat people can need up to 3 x more!

It is also completely safe for adults to take 10000 IU daily.

 **The main thing is just to have the vitamin D measured after, for example, 6 months after the daily intake of the same amount** .

(you decide where you start, for example you can start with 6000 IU for 6 months and then have it measured.

You can just as well start with any number between 6000 and 10000, just always take the same amount daily and measure after 6 months)

There is no sure way to tell how much each person should take.

The only safe way is to have the level measured in the blood after taking the same daily dose, for example, for 6 months.

After that, it is possible to estimate whether it is necessary to increase or decrease the daily dose that has been taken.

 **Today's leaders in the field of vitamin D recommend that everyone stays between 100 – 150 nmol/L. Today, 100 nmol/L = minimum**  **.** 

In particular, women are advised to be as close as possible to 150 nmol/L to significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer .
