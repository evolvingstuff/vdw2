PURPOSE: We performed a single-day cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency as well as folate status in healthy young female volunteers well educated with respect to health information.

METHODS: We assessed dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium, serum concentrations of 25-OH-vitamin D(3), folate, red blood cell folate and other dietary, laboratory, and lifestyle parameters in 215 young healthy women (age 18-30 years) on a single day at the end of the winter months. Primary aim was to investigate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. Folic acid status was a secondary study aim.

RESULTS: Mean daily ingestion of vitamin D was 2.25 ?g/day with a daily calcium intake of 749 mg/day. 6.9% had hypovitaminosis D (25-OH-vitamin D(3) <30 nmol/L) and  **89.3% were vitamin D insufficient (<75 nmol/L)** . 

Preplanned subpopulation comparison (lower vs. upper quartile) revealed a significant negative correlation (P = 0.048) between plasma PTH and 25-OH-vitamin D(3) levels. 

Fifteen individuals (6.9%) were folic acid deficient (<140 ng/mL RBC folate). 

Only 9.3% reached RBC folate concentrations regarded as optimal for the prevention of fetal neural tube defects (>400 ng/mL).

CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in healthy young women trained in health care professions is low but 89.3% can be classified as vitamin D insufficient in spring. 

Folate status can also be considered not sufficient. 

Considering the emerging role of higher vitamin D plasma levels for many health conditions, a timely correction of vitamin D status in the general Austrian population appears appropriate.
