 **From “Immunity Debt” to “Immunity Theft”—How COVID-19 Might Be Tied to Recent Respiratory Disease Surges**

The "GREEN" person started with a high level of Vitammin D

This assumes no vitamin D supplementation by supplements, sun, etc.

#### Some Vaccine Types Linked to Increased Risk of Other Infections in girls - Jan 2024

 **[The Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccines-increase-risk-other-infections/?utm_source=luminate&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=defender&utm_id=20240119)** 

"*Researchers found that vaccines that do not contain a live or weakened pathogen, while effective against the targeted infection, may also raise the risk of non-targeted infections, particularly in girls."

* "Live vaccines reported to have more positive effects"

* "Non-live vaccines may enhance risk of other diseases, especially in girls"

* "The DPT vaccine has been a prime investigation target for NSEs since the 1980s when its connection to [increased all-cause mortality](https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/5868131) was established."
