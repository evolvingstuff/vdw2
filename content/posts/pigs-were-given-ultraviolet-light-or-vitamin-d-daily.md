 **Lots of Vitamin D found in skin (UV is similar to giving vitamin D topically)**

There is limited data on the effect of UV light exposure versus orally ingested vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism and health. A 4-week study with 16 pigs (as a model for human physiology) was conducted. The pigs were either supplemented with 20 Âµg/d vitamin D3 or exposed to UV light for 19 min/d to standardise plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Important differences were higher levels of stored vitamin D3 in skin and subcutaneous fat, higher plasma concentrations of 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and increases of cutaneous lumisterol3 in UV-exposed pigs compared to supplemented pigs. UV light exposure compared to vitamin D3 supplementation resulted in lower hepatic cholesterol, higher circulating plasma nitrite, a marker of the blood pressure-lowering nitric oxide, and a reduction in the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, plasma metabolome and stool microbiome analyses did not reveal any differences between the two groups. 

To conclude, the current data show important health relevant differences between oral vitamin D3 supplementation and UV light exposure. The findings may also partly explain the different vitamin D effects on health parameters obtained from association and intervention studies.
