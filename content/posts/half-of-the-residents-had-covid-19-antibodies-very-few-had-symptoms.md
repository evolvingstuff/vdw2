**A slum in India (which has a lot of sunshine)** 

[57% of slum-dwellers tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/29/asia/india-mumbai-slum-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html) CNN July 29

But only 0.05% of the slum-dwellers are dying of COVID-19.

Slum-dwellers cannot afford air conditioning, masks, cannot be socially distant

They are outdoors (in the sun) much more

Shacks are too hot to be in during the day, many have to leave their dwelling to use a shared toilet

 **Possible Reasons for fewer COVID-10 problems include** 

1. They get more Vitamin D from the sun

1. They have fewer seniors

1. They have strong immune systems

1. They have an excellent tracking system (which would not account for more antibodies)

Note: Other equatorial slums - Brazil, Nigeria - appear to also have few COVID-19 problems

Note: Unaware of Vitamin D studies of slum dwellers
