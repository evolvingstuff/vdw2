Maternal vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide and has a significant impact on newborns. However, whether vitamin D intake during pregnancy is related to small vulnerable newborns (SVN) has not been confirmed. Thus, we sought to examine the relationship between maternal vitamin D intake, including vitamin D supplementation and dietary intake, and the risk of SVN. A total of 2980 Chinese mother-infant pairs were included in this study. Information on vitamin D supplementation and dietary intake was prospectively collected through face-to-face interviews. The outcomes assessed included low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), and SVN (having LBW, PTB, or SGA). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of vitamin D intake with different types of SVN, and a restricted cubic spline function was modeled to explore their dose-response associations. 

Compared to the lowest total vitamin D intake in the first trimester, the highest total vitamin D intake was associated with a 50.0% decrease in the SGA risk (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.96) and a 41.0% decrease in the SVN risk (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.95). Similar protective results were observed between vitamin D supplementation in the first trimester and SGA and SVN risks. Moreover, a significant L-shaped relationship was identified for total vitamin D intake, vitamin D supplementation, and dietary intake with the risk of different types of SVN. In conclusion, higher total vitamin D intake and supplementation in the first trimester were associated with a reduced risk of SGA and SVN.
