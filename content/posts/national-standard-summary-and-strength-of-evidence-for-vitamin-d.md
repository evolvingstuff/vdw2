## Background

   * Vitamin D is found in many dietary sources such as fish, eggs,  fortified milk, and cod liver oil. The sun also contributes  significantly to the daily production of vitamin D, and as little as 10  minutes of exposure is thought to be enough to prevent deficiencies. The  term "vitamin D" refers to several different forms of this vitamin. Two  forms are important in humans: ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and  cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Vitamin D2 is synthesized by plants.  Vitamin D3 is synthesized by humans in the skin when it is exposed to  ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays from sunlight. Foods may be fortified with  vitamin D2 or D3.

   * The major biologic function of vitamin D is  to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D  aids in the absorption of calcium, helping to form and maintain strong  bones. Recently, research also suggests vitamin D may provide protection  from osteoporosis, hypertension (high blood pressure), cancer, and  several autoimmune diseases.

   * Rickets and osteomalacia are  classic vitamin D deficiency diseases. In children, vitamin D deficiency  causes rickets, which results in skeletal deformities. In adults,  vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, which results in muscular  weakness in addition to weak bones. Populations who may be at a high  risk for vitamin D deficiencies include the elderly, obese individuals,  exclusively breastfed infants, and those who have limited sun exposure.  Also, individuals who have fat malabsorption syndromes (e.g., cystic  fibrosis) or inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease) are at  risk.

# <span style="color:#F00;">Scientific Evidence</span>

These uses have been tested in humans or animals. Safety and  effectiveness have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are  potentially serious, and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare  provider.
| | |
| --- | --- |
| Uses | <span style="color:#F00;">Grade</span> |
|  **Familial hypophosphatemia**  |
| Familial hypophosphatemia (low blood levels of phosphate in the blood)  is a rare inherited disorder that consists of impaired phosphate  transport in the blood and diminished vitamin D metabolism in the  kidneys. Familial hypophosphatemia is a form of rickets. Taking  calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol by mouth along with phosphate  supplements is effective for treating bone disorders in people with  familial hypophosphatemia. Management should be under medical  supervision. | A |
|  **Fanconi syndrome-related hypophosphatemia**  |
| Fanconi syndrome is a defect of the proximal tubules of the kidney, and  is associated with renal tubular acidosis. Taking ergocalciferol orally  is effective for treating hypophosphatemia associated with Fanconi  syndrome. | A |
|  **Hyperparathyroidism due to low vitamin D levels**  |
| Some patients may develop secondary hyperparathyroidism due to low  levels of vitamin D. The initial treatment for this type of  hyperparathyroidism is vitamin D. For patients with primary or  refractory hyperparathyroidism, surgical removal of the parathyroid  glands is commonly recommended. Studies also suggest that vitamin D  supplementation may reduce the incidence of hypoparathyroidism following  surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism (partial or total removal of  the parathyroid glands). | A |
|  **Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism**  |
| Hypoparathyroidism (low blood levels of parathyroid hormone) is rare,  and is often due to surgical removal of the parathyroid glands. High  oral doses of dihydrotachysterol (DHT), calcitriol, or ergocalciferol  can assist in increasing serum calcium concentrations in people with  hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism. | A |
|  **Osteomalacia (adult rickets)**  |
| Adults with severe vitamin D deficiency lose bone mineral content  ("hypomineralization") and experience bone pain, muscle weakness, and  osteomalacia (soft bones). Osteomalacia may be found among elderly  patients with vitamin D-deficient diets, individuals with decreased  absorption of vitamin D, individuals with inadequate sun exposure (such  as those living in latitudes with seasonal lack of sunlight), patients  with gastric or intestinal surgery, patients with aluminum-induced bone  disease, patients with chronic liver disease, or patients with kidney  disease with renal osteodystrophy. Treatment for osteomalacia depends on  the underlying cause of the disease and often includes pain control and  orthopedic surgical intervention, as well as vitamin D and phosphate  binding agents. | A |
|  **Psoriasis**  |
| A  number of different approaches are used in the treatment of psoriasis  skin plaques. Mild approaches include light therapy, stress reduction,  moisturizers, or salicylic acid to remove scaly skin areas. For more  severe cases, treatments may include UV-A light, psoralen plus UV-A  light (PUVA), retinoids such as isotretinoin (Accutane),  corticosteroids, or cyclosporine (Neoral®, Sandimmune®). The synthetic  vitamin D3 analog calcipotriene (Dovonex®) appears to control skin cell  growth and is used for moderately severe skin plaques, particularly for  skin lesions resistant to other therapies or located on the face.  Vitamin D3 (tacalcitol) ointment has been reported as being safe and  well-tolerated. High doses of becocalcidiol (a vitamin D analog) used on  the skin may be beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. | A |
|  **Rickets**  |
| Rickets develop in children with vitamin D deficiency due to a vitamin  D-deficient diet, a lack of sunlight, or both. Infants fed only breast  milk (without supplemental vitamin D) may also develop rickets. Although  now rare, partially due to the availability of vitamin D-fortified  milk, there has been a recent increase in rickets among children in  latitudes with periodic, seasonal lack of sunlight. Ergocalciferol or  cholecalciferol is effective for treating vitamin D deficiency rickets.  Calcitriol should be used in patients with renal (kidney) failure.  Treatment should be under medical supervision. | A |
|  **Muscle weakness/pain**  |
| Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with muscle weakness and pain  in both adults and children. Limited research has reported vitamin D  deficiency in patients with low-back pain, and supplementation may  reduce pain in many patients. | B |
|  **Osteoporosis (general)**  |
| Without sufficient vitamin D, inadequate calcium is absorbed and the  resulting elevated parathyroid (PTH) secretion causes increased bone  resorption. This may weaken bones and increase the risk of fracture.  Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to slow bone loss and reduce  fracture, particularly when taken with calcium. | B |
|  **Renal osteodystrophy**  |
| Renal osteodystrophy is a term that refers to all of the bone problems  that occur in patients with chronic kidney failure. Oral calcifediol or  ergocalciferol may help manage hypocalcemia and prevent renal  osteodystrophy in people with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis. | B |
|  **Anticonvulsant-induced osteomalacia**  |
| Supplementation with vitamin D2 has been reported to reduce seizure  frequency in initial research. Further study is needed to confirm these  results. | C |
|  **Breast cancer prevention**  |
| High-dose vitamin D supplementation may be associated with a slightly  reduced risk of developing breast cancer. Additional study in this area  is warranted. | C |
|  **Cancer prevention**  |
| Limited research suggests that synthetic vitamin D analogs may play a  role in the treatment of human cancers. However, it remains unclear if  vitamin D deficiency raises cancer risk, or if an increased intake of  vitamin D is protective against some cancers. Until additional trials  are conducted, it is premature to advise the use of regular vitamin D  supplementation to prevent cancer. | C |
|  **Colorectal cancer**  |
| Data from a meta-analysis suggest that supplemental vitamin D may  prevent the development of colorectal cancer. More research is needed in  this area. | C |
|  **Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis**  |
| Some evidence implies that steroids may impair vitamin D metabolism,  further contributing to the loss of bone and development of osteoporosis  associated with steroid medications. There is limited evidence that  vitamin D may be beneficial to bone strength in patients taking  long-term steroids. | C |
|  **Diabetes (type 1/type 2)**  |
| Type 1 diabetes : It has been reported that infants given calcitriol  during the first year of life are less likely to develop type 1 diabetes  than infants fed lesser amounts of vitamin D. Other related studies  have suggested using cod liver oil as a source of vitamin D to reduce  the incidence of type 1 diabetes. There is currently insufficient  evidence to form a clear conclusion in this area. Type 2 diabetes : In  recent studies, adults given vitamin D supplementation were shown to  improve insulin sensitivity. Further research is needed to confirm these  results. | C |
|  **Fall prevention**  |
| Multiple trials have found conflicting results for the effects of  vitamin D in the prevention of falls. More studies are needed. | C |
|  **Hepatic osteodystrophy**  |
| Metabolic bone disease is common among patients with chronic liver  disease, and osteoporosis accounts for the majority of cases. Varying  degrees of calcium malabsorption may occur in patients with chronic  liver disease due to malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency. Oral or  injected vitamin D may play a role in the management of this condition. | C |
|  **High blood pressure (hypertension)**  |
| Low levels of vitamin D may play a role in the development of high  blood pressure. It has been noted that blood pressure is often elevated  under the following conditions: during the winter season, at a further  distance from the equator, and in individuals with dark skin  pigmentation (all of which are associated with lower production of  vitamin D via sunlight). However, evidence is not clear, and a  comparison with more proven methods to reduce blood pressure has not  been conducted. Patients with elevated blood pressure should be managed  by a licensed healthcare professional. | C |
|  **Hypertriglyceridemia**  |
| There is insufficient evidence in this area. | C |
|  **Immunomodulation**  |
| Preliminary human evidence suggests that vitamin D and its analogues,  such as alfacalcidol, may act as immunomodulatory agents. More studies  are needed to confirm these results. | C |
|  **Mortality reduction**  |
| Intake of vitamin D may be associated with a reduction in total  mortality. Additional evidence is needed to confirm this association. | C |
|  **Multiple sclerosis (MS)**  |
| Scientists have detected MS rates to be lower in areas with greater  sunlight and higher consumption of vitamin D rich fish. Preliminary  research suggests that long-term vitamin D supplementation decreases the  risk of MS; however, additional research is necessary before a firm  conclusion can be reached. | C |
|  **Myelodysplastic syndrome**  |
| There is insufficient evidence in this area. | C |
|  **Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)**  |
| OI is a genetic disease that consists of unusually fragile bones that  break easily, often under loads that normal bones bear daily due to a  malfunction in the body's production of collagen. Proper calcium and  vitamin D intake is essential to maintaining strong bones. | C |
|  **Osteoporosis (cystic fibrosis patients)**  |
| Osteoporosis is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (due to fat  malabsorption, which leads to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins such  as vitamin D). Oral calcitriol administration appears to increase the  absorption of calcium and decrease parathyroid concentrations. | C |
|  **Proximal myopathy**  |
| There is insufficient evidence in this area. | C |
|  **Rickets (hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant)**  |
| There are insufficient data to support a role of vitamin D in this condition. | C |
|  **Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)**  |
| Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that occurs  during the winter months, possibly due to reduced exposure to sunlight.  In one study, vitamin D was found to be better than light therapy in the  treatment of SAD. Further studies are necessary to confirm these  findings. | C |
|  **Senile warts**  |
| In early study, senile warts have been treated with topical vitamin D3. | C |
|  **Skin pigmentation disorders (pigmented lesions)**  |
| Application of vitamin D3 ointment on the skin, in combination with  intense pulsed-radio frequency, may be beneficial in the treatment of  pigmented lesions associated with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). | C |
|  **Tooth retention**  |
| Oral bone and tooth loss are correlated with bone loss at non-oral  sites. Research suggests that intake levels of calcium and vitamin D  aimed at preventing osteoporosis may have a beneficial effect on tooth  retention. | C |
|  **Vitamin D deficiency (infants and nursing mothers)**  |
| High-quality clinical trial evidence suggests that high doses of  supplemental vitamin D provided to breast feeding mothers may improve  the vitamin D status of both mother and child. More research is needed  to confirm these findings. | C |
|  **Weight gain (postmenopausal)**  |
| Vitamin D supplementation (in combination with calcium) may have an  effect on post-menopausal weight gain. Evidence suggests this may be  particularly true in women consuming inadequate calcium and warrants  further study. | C |
|  **Muscle strength**  |
| Oral cholecalciferol does not appear to increase muscle strength or  improve physical performance in healthy older men who are not vitamin D  deficient. | D |
|  **Prostate cancer**  |
| There is preliminary evidence based on laboratory and human studies that  high-dose vitamin D may be beneficial in the treatment of prostate  cancer. However, the induction of hypercalcemia at the doses required to  inhibit cancer proliferation have impeded its use in clinical trials.  This treatment, including the development of non-calcemic analogs,  remains under active investigation; however, clear evidence of benefit  is not yet available. | D |

## Dosing

The below doses are based on scientific research, publications,  traditional use, or expert opinion. Many herbs and supplements have not  been thoroughly tested, and safety and effectiveness may not be proven.  Brands may be made differently, with variable ingredients, even within  the same brand. The below doses may not apply to all products. You  should read product labels, and discuss doses with a qualified  healthcare provider before starting therapy.

 **Adults (over 18 years old)** 

   * Vitamin D is included in most multivitamins, usually in strengths from  50 IU to 1,000 IU as softgels, capsules, tablets, and liquids. The  Adequate Intake (AI) levels have been established by the U.S. Institute  of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Recommendations are: 5  micrograms (200 IU or International Units) daily for all individuals  (males, female, pregnant/lactating women) under the age of 50 years-old.  For all individuals from 50-70 years-old, 10 micrograms daily (400 IU)  is recommended. For those who are over 70 years-old, 15 micrograms daily  (600 IU) is suggested. Some authors have questioned whether the current  recommended adequate levels are sufficient to meet physiological needs,  particularly for individuals deprived of regular sun exposure. The  upper limit (UL) for vitamin D has been recommended as 2,000 IU daily  due to toxicities that can occur when taken in higher doses.

   * Not all doses have been found effective for conditions that have been  studied. However, ergocalciferol has been used in an oral dose of 400 to  800 IU per day (sometimes higher doses are used in conjunction with  calcium) for osteoporosis prevention and treatment.

   * Calcitriol  has been used in an initial oral dose of 0.25 micrograms per day;  dosing may be increased by 0.25 micrograms per day at four to eight week  intervals in patients with hypocalcemia from chronic dialysis.

   * Dihydrotachysterol has been used in an oral initial dose of 750  micrograms (0.75 milligrams) to 2.5 milligrams per day for several days  for the treatment of hypoparathroidism. A maintenance dose is typically  200 micrograms (0.2 milligrams) to 1 milligram per day. Ergocalciferol  has also been used in an oral dose of 50,000 to 200,000 IU units daily  concomitantly with calcium lactate 4 grams, six times per day.

   * Rickets may be treated gradually over several months or in a single  day's dose. Gradual dosing may be 125-250 micrograms (5,000-10,000 IU)  taken daily for two to three months, until recovery is well established  and alkaline phosphatase blood concentration is close to normal limits.  Single-day dosing may be 15,000 micrograms (600,000 IU) of vitamin D,  taken by mouth divided into four to six doses. Intramuscular injection  is also an alternative for single-day dosing. For resistant rickets,  some authors suggest a higher dose of 12,000 to 500,000 IU per day,  although this has not yet been proven effective.

 **Children (under 18 years old)** 

   * Adequate Intake (AI) levels have been established by the U.S. Institute  of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. The recommendation  from birth until 50 years old is 5 micrograms per day (200 IU or  International Units per day). Children older than one year should not  exceed the "upper limit" (UL) of 50 micrograms (2,000 IU) per day;  children younger than one year should not exceed the UL of 25 micrograms  (1,000 IU) per day. Vitamin D is possibly unsafe when used orally in  excessive amounts, with adverse effects including hypercalcemia (high  blood calcium levels). Some authors have questioned whether the current  recommended adequate levels are sufficient to meet physiological needs,  particularly for individuals deprived of regular sun exposure. A 2008  review recommends 400 IU per day for all infants and children, including  adolescents, based on evidence from new clinical trials and the  historical precedence.

   * Not all doses have been found effective  for conditions that have been studied. However, for hypoparathyroidism,  ergocalciferol has been used orally in an initial dose of 8,000 units  per kilogram per day for one to two weeks. For maintenance, a dose of  2,000 units per kilogram per day has been used.

   * Rickets may be  treated gradually over several months or in a single day's dose. Based  on one clinical trial, a single dose of 600,000 IU of oral vitamin D3  was comparable to a dose of 20,000 IU per day of oral vitamin D3 for 30  days. Gradual dosing may be 125-250 micrograms (5000-10,000 IU) taken  daily for two to three months, until recovery is well established and  alkaline phosphatase blood concentration is close to normal limits.  Single-day dosing may be 15,000 micrograms (600,000 IU) of vitamin D,  taken by mouth divided into 4-6 doses. Intramuscular injection is also  an alternative for single-day dosing. For resistant rickets, some  authors suggest a higher dose of 12,000 to 500,000 IU per day.

## Safety

Many complementary techniques are practiced by healthcare professionals  with formal training, in accordance with the standards of national  organizations. However, this is not universally the case, and adverse  effects are possible. Due to limited research, in some cases only  limited safety information is available.

 **Allergies** 

   * Avoid or use caution with known hypersensitivity to vitamin D or any of its analogues and derivatives.

 **Side Effects and Warnings** 

   * Vitamin D is generally well tolerated in recommended "Adequate Intake  (AI)" doses. One study found a greater likelihood of daytime sleepiness  for patients given vitamin D analogues.

   * Vitamin D toxicity can  result from regular excess intake of this vitamin, and may lead to  hypercalcemia and excess bone loss. Individuals at particular risk  include those with hyperparathyroidism, kidney disease, sarcoidosis,  tuberculosis, or histoplasmosis. Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to  serious or even life-threatening complications, and should be managed by  a physician. Early symptoms of hypercalcemia may include nausea,  vomiting, and anorexia (appetite/weight loss), followed by polyuria  (excess urination), polydipsia (excess thirst), weakness, fatigue,  somnolence, headache, dry mouth, metallic taste, vertigo, tinnitus (ear  ringing), and ataxia (unsteadiness). Kidney function may become  impaired, and metastatic calcifications (calcium deposition in organs  throughout the body) may occur, particularly affecting the kidneys.  Treatment involves stopping the intake of vitamin D or calcium, and  lowering the calcium levels under strict medical supervision, with  frequent monitoring of calcium levels. Acidification of urine and  corticosteroids may be necessary.

 **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding** 

   * The recommended adequate intake for pregnant women is the same as for  non-pregnant adults. Some authors have suggested that requirements  during pregnancy may be greater than these amounts, particularly in  sun-deprived individuals, although this has not been clearly  established. Due to risks of vitamin D toxicity, any consideration of  higher daily doses of vitamin D should be discussed with a physician.

   * Vitamin D is typically low in maternal milk, and to prevent deficiency  and rickets in exclusively breastfed infants, supplementation may be  necessary, starting within the first two months of life.

## Interactions

 **Interactions with Drugs** 

   * Hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium levels) may develop when  magnesium-containing antacids are used concurrently with vitamin D,  particularly in patients with chronic renal failure.

   * Decreased  vitamin D effects may occur with the use of certain anti-seizure drugs,  as they may induce hepatic microsomal enzymes and accelerate the  conversion of vitamin D to inactive metabolites.

   * Based on mechanism of action, use of vitamin D and calcium together may alter inflammatory response.

   * Intestinal absorption of vitamin D may be impaired with the use of  these agents. Patients on cholestyramine or colestipol should be advised  to allow as much time as possible between the ingestion of these drugs  and vitamin D.

   * Use of corticosteroids can cause osteoporosis  and calcium depletion with long-term administration. This calcium  depletion creates a greater need for both supplemental calcium and  vitamin D (which is necessary for calcium absorption).

   * Vitamin  D should be used with caution in patients taking digoxin, because  hypercalcemia (which may result with excess vitamin D use) may  precipitate abnormal heart rhythms.

   * Intestinal absorption of vitamin D may be impaired with the use of mineral oil.

   * Orlistat (an obesity drug) can reduce vitamin D levels. Patients should  consider taking a multivitamin with fat-soluble vitamins at least two  hours before or after orlistat or at bedtime.

   * Rifampin  increases vitamin D metabolism and reduces vitamin D blood levels. The  need for vitamin D supplementation with rifampin has not been thoroughly  studied, although additional supplementation may be necessary.

   * Stimulant laxatives can reduce dietary vitamin D absorption. Stimulant  laxatives should be limited to short-term use if possible.

   * Concurrent administration of thiazide diuretics and vitamin D to  hypoparathyroid patients may cause hypercalcemia, which may be transient  or may require discontinuation of vitamin D. Examples of thiazide  diuretics include chlorothiazide (Diuril®), chlorthalidone (Hygroton®,  Thalitone®), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ®, Esidrix®, HydroDIURIL®, Ortec®,  Microzide®), indapamide (Lozol®), and metolazone (Zaroxolyn®).

 **Interactions with Herbs and Dietary Supplements** 

   * Based on mechanism of action, the use of vitamin D and calcium together may alter inflammatory response.

   * Vitamin D should be used with caution in patients taking herbs with  similar properties on the heart as digoxin, because hypercalcemia (which  may result with excess vitamin D use) may precipitate abnormal heart  rhythms.

   * Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption. Vitamin D is often included in calcium supplement products.
