Background

Bariatric patients often suffer from vitamin D deficiency (VDD), and both, morbid obesity and VDD, are related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, limited data are available regarding best strategies for treating VDD, particularly, in bariatric patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass (OLGB). Therefore, we examined the efficacy and safety of a forced vitamin D dosing regimen and intervention effects in liver fibrotic patients.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 50 vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing OLGB were randomly assigned to receive, in the first month postoperatively, oral vitamin D3 (=3 doses of 100,000 IU; intervention group) or placebo as loading dose (control group) with subsequent maintenance dose (3420 IU/day) in both groups until 6-month visit.

Results

Compared with control group, higher increase of 25(OH)D (67.9 (21.1) vs. 55.7 nmol/L (21.1); p = 0.049) with lower prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (10 vs. 24 %; p = 0.045) was observed in intervention group. No (serious) adverse events related to study medication were found.  **The loading dose regimen was more effective in increasing 25(OH)D in patients with significant liver fibrosis**  while this was not the case for conventional supplementation (placebo with maintenance dose) (71.5 (20.5) vs. 22.5 nmol/L (13.8); p = 0.022; n = 14).

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that a high vitamin D3 loading dose, in the first month postoperatively, with subsequent maintenance dose is effective and safe in achieving higher vitamin D concentrations in OLGB patients. Unexpectedly, it is more effective in patients with significant liver fibrosis which is of potentially high clinical relevance and requires further investigation.
