Great advances in neonatal intensive care have improved survival rates of infants who once had little chance for survival such as preterm babies <sup>[1, 2]</sup>. Organ system immaturity in preterm infants is connected with long term complications that have both clinical and public health importance <sup>[1]</sup>. Severe hypoxia occurs in most preterm infants leading to cell death which may be necrotic or apoptotic <sup>[1]</sup>. Significant elevation of apoptotic activity has been shown to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of several diseases associated with prematurity such as renal dysfunction <sup>[1]</sup>. In the kidneys of preterm infants, apoptosis has been described in tubular epithelial cells <sup>[1]</sup>. Renal tubular cell apoptosis has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute renal failure <sup>[3]</sup>. The consequences of premature birth or low birth weight on nephrogenesis, final nephron number and long-term kidney function are still not well defined <sup>[2]</sup>.The kidney of low birth weight preterm infan . . .
