 **Doctors are still given extremely little nutrition & supplement instruction** 

60% of med schools surveyed said in 2006 that they teach  less than 25 hours of Nutrition and Life-Style

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: in 1985 25 hours was the recommended minimum - 60% not even achieving the minimum!

Ref: Adams, Kelly et al. 2006. Status of nutrition education in medical schools. American Society for Clinical Nutrition.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Update 2024 - ZERO hours on nutrition in many medical colleges

 **"Extremely Big Pharma" was not found by Google Search - this appears to be the first use of the phrase.** 

 **The goal of the Big Pharma is to indefinitely "manage" disease** 

&nbsp; &nbsp; curing a disease would destroy the market (Talk about a perverse incentive structure).

 **The prime directive of any individual or institution is self-preservation** 

 **[Big Pharma has made it illegal to claim that a supplement can treat a disease](http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/QADietarySupplements/ucm191930.htm#legal_market) FDA Website** 

". . a product sold as a dietary supplement and promoted on its label or in labeling* as a treatment, prevention or cure for a specific disease or condition would be considered an unapproved- - and thus illegal - drug"

* "The idea of allowing Americans to import drugs from Canada or other developed countries is strongly opposed by the powerful United States pharmaceutical industry"

* "Last fall, a new law in Maine began allowing residents to mail order prescription medicines from licensed pharmacies in Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand"

 **Observation by VitaminDWiki** 

US laws changed recently - Each drug company no longer has any competition and no longer has to justify their prices.

The US law states, for example, that Medicare is not allowed to look for a lower price for a drug inside nor outside of the US.

Doubt that the international price of drugs went up by even 20% during that same time period.
