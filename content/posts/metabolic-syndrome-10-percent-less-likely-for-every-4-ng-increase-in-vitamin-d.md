Increasing evidence suggests that 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). In 2010, we explored the association of serum 25(OH)D and PTH levels with MetS in 1,390 Chinese participants, aged 20-83 years. Anthropometric phenotypes, blood pressure, and the incidence of MetS were evaluated. In addition, serum lipids, 25(OH)D, and PTH were measured. The median concentration of 25(OH)D and PTH were 55.3 nmol/l and 2.8 pmol/l, respectively. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/l) was 39.9 %, with 34.5 % in men and 47.8 % in women. 

After accounting for confounding factors and serum PTH, a 10 nmol/l higher serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a 10 % lower risk of MetS (OR = 0.90, 95 % CI 0.84-0.96, P = 0.0007). 

Furthermore, participants with vitamin D sufficiency had a 35 % lower risk of MetS than those with vitamin D deficiency (OR = 0.65, 95 % CI 0.51-0.84, P = 0.0009). 

PTH was not associated with the risk of MetS after adjustment for confounding factors. These results were confirmed in both men and women. Thus in this cohort of Chinese individuals, vitamin D deficiency is common and optimal vitamin D level is inversely associated with MetS, independent of several confounders and PTH level. The clinical significance of these findings warrants further study.
