#### [Foods highest in Vitamin D](http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000102000000000000000-1.html?)

* The list is sorted by vitamin D content, not the name of the food

* per 200-calorie serving

* Note that the fish listed are wild.

> Farmed fish (60% of the type sold in the US) typically have only 1/4 as much vitamin D

* This is for US foods - which typically have a lot more vitamin D fortification than other foods around the world

* It probably does not include the 6X more vitamin D in meat, which was found in early 2014 (see below)
