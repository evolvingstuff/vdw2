Objectives: 

High prevalence of vitamin D deficiency mandates prescribing an appropriate form of vitamin D that allows attainment of sufficiency in a cost-effective manner. We aimed to compare vitamin D products in Indian market in terms of composition and cost in 2020 with 2013 to understand price dispersion over 7 years.

Methods: 

Constituents, formulations, and prices of ‘branded’ and generic vitamin D products were sourced from various drug information compendia and online sources. Price per defined daily dose (DDD), percentage cost variation, and change in prices over 7 years (2020 vs. 2013) was determined.

Results: 

There has been a disproportionate increase in the number of brands and cost variation of cholecalciferol and calcitriol in the last 7 years. The percentage cost variation increased almost 10 times for calcitriol and 4.4 times for alfacalcidiol tablets and cholecalciferol granules. An analysis of >1,100 products in 2020 showed that the predominant form was calcitriol which was combined with calcium in >90% of the products with huge cost variation (>3000%). Ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol were available in 22 and 15 different strengths respectively. Median price/unit of cholecalciferol (60,000IU) was lower for tablets/capsules compared to other formulations; but with >1000% cost variation.

Conclusion: 

A wide cost variation exists with the use of different vitamin D brands and preparations with conventional cholecalciferol tablets and capsules being a low-priced alternative. Quality control measures and strict enforcements of existing regulations are essential to ensure that competitive prices of branded generics are translated into availability and affordability for the population.
