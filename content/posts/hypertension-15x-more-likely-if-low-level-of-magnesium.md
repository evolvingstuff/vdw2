Those having enough Mg to excrete extra to urine had

* lower total cholesterol

* lower BMI

* lower blood pressure

Serum, plasma and dietary magnesium (Mg) have been reported to be inversely associated with cardiovasculardisease risk factors. We examined the associations between the 24-h urinary Mg/creatinine (Cre) ratio and cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), serum total cholesterol (TC) and prevalence of obesity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 4211 participants (49.7% women) aged 48-56 years in 50 population samples from 22 countries in the World Health Organization-coordinated Cardiovascular Diseases and Alimentary Comparison (CARDIAC) Study (1985-1994). 

In linear regression analyses, Mg/Cre ratio was inversely associated with 

* BMI, 

* systolic BP (SBP), 

* diastolic BP (DBP) and 

* TC (P for linear trend <0.001 for each). 

These associations were not markedly altered by adjustment for traditional risk factors, urinary markers or cohort effects. Multivariate-adjusted mean values for the subjects in the highest Mg/Cre ratio quintile were 6.3, 3.4, 5.3 and 4.6% lower than those for the subjects in the lowest quintile for BMI, SBP, DBP and TC (P<0.001, respectively). 

The prevalence of obesity,  **hypertension**  and hypercholesterolemia was 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.50, 2.95),  **1.55** (1.25, 1.92) and 2.06 (1.63, 2.62) times higher (P<0.001, respectively) among the subjects in the lowest Mg/Cre ratio quintile than in the subjects in the highest quintile. 

These associations were not appreciably altered by adjustment for potential confounding variables. In conclusion,  **higher 24-h urinary Mg/Cre ratio**  was associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk factors, including BMI, BP, TC, obesity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
