#### Trends in Self-reported Spontaneous Abortions: 1970–2000 - Aug 2012

* "After accounting for abortion availability and the characteristics of pregnant women, the rate of reported miscarriages increased by about 1.0% per year. "

 **Speculation by VitaminDWiki: Might the increased miscarriage rate be associated with decreased Vitamin D levels?**

* "A 2020 study found that one in six women who have a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy suffer from long-term post-traumatic stress. When you consider that anywhere from  **10-20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage** , that’s a lot of people who likely end up suffering privately at work, unable to take time off to recuperate."

Objective: To determine the association between vitamin D levels in the male partner and fertility outcomes in couples with mild male factor infertility.

Design: Secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial.

Setting: Nine fertility centers in the United States.

Patient(s): Men (n = 154) with sperm concentration between 5 and 15 million/mL, motility ≤40%, or normal morphology ≤4% were eligible. Female partners were ovulatory, ≤40 years old, and had documented tubal patency.

Intervention(s): Men provided semen and blood at baseline for semen analysis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. They were randomly assigned to receive a vitamin formulation including vitamin D 2,000 IU daily or placebo for up to 6 months. Couples attempted to conceive naturally during the first 3 months and with clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination of the female partner in months 4 through 6.

Main outcome measure(s): Primary: sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation at baseline. Secondary: cumulative pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates.

Result(s): Semen parameters and sperm DNA fragmentation were not statistically significantly different between men with vitamin D deficiency and men with 25(OH)D levels ≥20 ng/mL. In addition, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were similar. Male 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL was associated with a higher rate of pregnancy loss (adjusted odds ratio  **9.0** ; 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 61.3).

Conclusion(s): Vitamin D deficiency in the male partner did not significantly impact semen parameters or treatment outcomes. Further study is warranted to better characterize the rate of miscarriage in couples with male vitamin D deficiency.
