OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was an association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration and walking speed measured at usual and fast pace among older women. METHODS: Usual- and fast-pace walking speeds and 25OHD concentrations were assessed in 739 randomized older women (mean 80.2+/-3.5y) from EPIDOS study. Following 25OHD thresholds were used: 10ng/mL, 20ng/mL, 30ng/mL. Walking speed was dichotomized on being in the worst quintile or not. Age, body mass index, number of chronic diseases, physical activity, quadriceps strength, cognition, use of psychoactive drugs and serum parathormon were used as potential confounders. 

RESULTS: Ninety percent of subjects had 25OHD insufficiency. Only fast-pace walking speed was significantly different between groups (P=0.021) and decreased from normal serum 25OHD concentrations to severe insufficiency (P-trend=0.007). Serum 25OHD concentration was associated with walking speed at both usual and fast pace in the unadjusted linear regression (beta=0.16, P=0.027; beta=0.23, P=0.009, respectively). This association remained significant only for fast-pace walking after adjustment (Adjustedbeta=0.18, P=0.033) and was strengthened from a lower 25OHD value compared to usual pace (25OHD=27.15ng/mL for fast pace and 25OHD=38.65ng/mL for usual pace). Lastly, logistic regression showed a stronger association of serum 25OHD insufficiency with fast-pace walking speed whatever the 25OHD thresholds used (30-20ng/mL: AdjustedOR(AdjOR)=6.01, P=0.003; 20-10ng/mL: AdjOR=4.10, P=0.014; <10ng/mL: AdjOR=6.95, P=0.001), compared to usual pace (30-20ng/mL: AdjOR=3.79, P=0.022; 20-10ng/mL: AdjOR=3.76, P=0.016; <10ng/mL: AdjOR=5.44, P=0.003). 

 **CONCLUSIONS:** The findings show a stronger positive association between 25OHD concentrations and fast-pace walking speed which is a more sensitive marker of neuromuscular functioning compared to usual-pace. (c) 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. DOI: 10.1002/jbmr.80
