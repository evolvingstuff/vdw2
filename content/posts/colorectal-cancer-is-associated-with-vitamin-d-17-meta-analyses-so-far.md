This again has documented the association of Colorectal Cancer with Vitamin D

This study, like many of the previous ones, asks for trials to be run to see that is it more than an association

[Clinical trials are listed for Colorectal Cancer and Vitamin D](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Colorectal+Cancer&term=&type=&rslt=&age_v=&gndr=&intr=%22vitamin+d%22&titles=&outc=&spons=&lead=&id=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&locn=&strd_s=&strd_e=&prcd_s=&prcd_e=&sfpd_s=&sfpd_e=&lupd_s=&lupd_e=) 18 as of July 2018

Most of the trials deal with TREATMENT, not PREVENTION.

Most of the trials are still underway, and it appears that none of been published as of July 2018

 **I anticipate that someone will do a re-analysis of a long-term clinical trial which used high dose vitamin D for some other health problem. Suspect that they will be able to find a decrease in colorectal cancer in the elderly group which got high dose vitamin D for > 5 years.
