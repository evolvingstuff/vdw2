OBJECTIVE:

This study describes the trends in blood vitamin D levels in a regional population from 2009-2012 through a cross-sectional study design.

METHODS:

Over a four-year period (2009-2012), serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> have been measured using an automated enzyme immunoassay with a steadily increasing number of tests performed each year. A total of 54700 tests were performed during this period, with a 90% increase in annual tests ordered.

RESULTS:

Mean and median serum levels of 25(OH) D showed statistically significant increases during this period. Those with 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/mL represented  **1.45% of the subjects in 2009 and 0.3% in 2012** . The decrease in the proportion of subjects with 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/mL and below 30 ng/mL was greatest out of all the proportioned subjects. Mean and median 25(OH)D levels increased with age in males and females.

CONCLUSION:

 **These results likely reflect increased health awareness in Western Connecticut compared with national surveys showing a temporal decrease in 25(OH)D levels.**
