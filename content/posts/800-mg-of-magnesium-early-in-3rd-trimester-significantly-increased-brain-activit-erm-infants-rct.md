 **Key Points** 

* Question  Is magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) administered to women at risk of imminent preterm birth associated with increased functional connectivity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in infants at term-equivalent age?

* Findings  In this cohort study of 45 infants nested within a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 24 infants exposed to MgSO4 had greater voxelwise functional connectivity on MRI than 21 infants in the placebo group in the temporal and occipital lobes and deep gray matter structures. Exposure to MgSO4 was associated with significantly greater measures of functional segregation and integration.

* Meaning  These findings suggest that enhanced functional connectivity is a possible mechanism by which MgSO4 protects against cerebral palsy and death.

Importance  Understanding the effect of antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) treatment on functional connectivity will help elucidate the mechanism by which it reduces the risk of cerebral palsy and death.

Objective  To determine whether MgSO4 administered to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks is associated with increased functional connectivity and measures of functional segregation and integration in infants at term-equivalent age, possibly reflecting a protective mechanism of MgSO4.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cohort study was nested within a randomized placebo-controlled trial performed across 24 tertiary maternity hospitals. Participants included infants born to women at risk of imminent preterm birth at a gestational age between 30 and 34 weeks who participated in the MAGENTA (Magnesium Sulphate at 30 to 34 Weeks’ Gestational Age) trial and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. Ineligibility criteria included illness precluding MRI, congenital or genetic disorders likely to affect brain structure, and living more than 1 hour from the MRI center. One hundred and fourteen of 159 eligible infants were excluded due to incomplete or motion-corrupted MRI. Recruitment occurred between October 22, 2014, and October 25, 2017. Participants were followed up to 2 years of age. Analysis was performed from February 1, 2021, to February 27, 2024. Observers were blind to patient groupings during data collection and processing.

Exposures  Women received  **4 g of MgSO4**  or isotonic sodium chloride solution given intravenously over 30 minutes.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Prior to data collection, it was hypothesized that infants who were exposed to MgSO4 would show enhanced functional connectivity compared with infants who were not exposed.

Results  A total of 45 infants were included in the analysis: 24 receiving MgSO4 treatment and 21 receiving placebo; 23 (51.1%) were female and 22 (48.9%) were male; and the median gestational age at scan was 40.0 (IQR, 39.1-41.1) weeks. Treatment with MgSO4 was associated with greater voxelwise functional connectivity in the temporal and occipital lobes and deep gray matter structures and with significantly greater clustering coefficients (Hedge g, 0.47 <span>[95% CI, −0.13 to 1.07]</span>), transitivity (Hedge g, 0.51 <span>[95% CI, −0.10 to 1.11]</span>), local efficiency (Hedge g, 0.40 <span>[95% CI, −0.20 to 0.99]</span>), and global efficiency (Hedge g, 0.31 <span>[95% CI, −0.29 to 0.90]</span>), representing enhanced functional segregation and integration.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study, infants exposed to MgSO4 had greater voxelwise functional connectivity and functional segregation, consistent with increased brain maturation. Enhanced functional connectivity is a possible mechanism by which MgSO4 protects against cerebral palsy and death.
