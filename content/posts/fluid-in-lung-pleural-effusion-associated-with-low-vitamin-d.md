BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D and vitamin D dependent antimicrobial peptides such as  **Cathelicidin (LL-37)**  and ß-defensin 2 have an important role in innate and adaptative immunity, but their role in pleural effusions has not been studied before.

METHODS:

Serum and pleural fluid samples from 152 patients with pleural effusion were collected, corresponding to 45 transudates and 107 exudates, 51 infectious effusions (14 complicated and 37 non-complicated), 44 congestive heart failure effusions and 38 malignant effusions. The levels of 25 OH-vitamin D, 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D, Vitamin D Binding Protein (VDBP), LL-37 and ß-defensin 2, both in serum and pleural fluid were evaluated in this prospective study. Differences between groups were analysed using unpaired t tests or Mann-Whitney tests. Correlations between data sets were examined using Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Diagnostic accuracy was estimated using ROC curve analysis.

RESULTS:

 **Low serum 25 OH vitamin D levels were found in all groups** . Infectious effusions (IE) had higher serum and pleural fluid LL-37 levels compared to congestive heart failure or malignant effusions. Among IE, complicated had higher serum and pleural fluid LL-37 levels, and lower serum ß-defensin-2 levels. Positive correlations were found between serum 25 OH-vitamin D levels and serum or pleural 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D levels, and between 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D and LL-37 serum. Diagnostic accuracy of the different molecules was moderate at best.

CONCLUSIONS:

 **Hypovitaminosis D is highly prevalent in pleural effusions** . LL-37 is produced intrapleurally in IE. This production is higher in complicated IE. No evidence of pleural production of ß-defensin 2 was found in any of the groups. Diagnostic accuracy of the different molecules is at the best moderate for discriminating different types of effusions.

INTRODUCTION:

Growing evidence suggests a role of vitamin D in various cancers but the significance of vitamin D in malignant pleural disease remains unexplored. We sought to investigate the concentration and diagnostic role of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in malignant pleural effusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

Prospective study of consecutive treatment-naïve patients with a new diagnosis of pleural effusion.

RESULTS:

Seventy-eight patients were studied, 45 of whom had malignant pleural effusions. 

Concentration of 25(OH)D in pleural fluid was significantly higher than serum in both malignant (15.2 ng/ml (9.7, 25.6) versus 10.2 ng/ml (6.4, 17.7), p<0.001) and benign (11.4 ng/ml (8.4, 23.6) versus 7.9 (5.9, 16.1), p<0.001) pleural disease.

Pleural fluid 25(OH)D was almost significantly higher in exudates compared to transudates (p=0.050) but it did not differ significantly between malignant and benign effusions (p=0.217) and it was not diagnostic for malignant pleural disease (AUC 0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.71).

CONCLUSIONS:

In subjects with unselected pleural effusions, 25(OH)D in pleural fluid was not diagnostic for malignant pleural disease. 

 **The novel finding of convincingly and consistently higher 25(OH)D in pleural fluid than serum suggests a role for vitamin D in pleural disease and merits further research.**

#### Fluid on the lungs cleared by active vitamin D (mice, shows how) – Jan 2016

 **1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Enhances Alveolar Fluid Clearance by Upregulating the Expression of Epithelial Sodium Channels.** 

J Pharm Sci. 2016 Jan;105(1):333-8. [doi: 10.1016/j.xphs.2015.11.022.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2015.11.022.) Epub 2016 Jan 13.

Vitamin D is implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, acute lung injury, and other respiratory diseases. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3), the hormonal form of vitamin D, has been shown to reduce vascular permeability and ameliorate lung edema. Therefore, we speculate that 1,25(OH)2D3 may regulate alveolar Na(+) transport via targeting epithelial Na(+) channels (ENaC), a crucial pathway for alveolar fluid clearance. In vivo total alveolar fluid clearance was 39.4 ± 3.8% in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice, significantly greater than vehicle-treated controls (24.7 ± 1.9 %, n = 10, p < 0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 increased amiloride-sensitive short-circuit currents in H441 monolayers, and whole-cell patch-clamp data confirmed that ENaC currents in single H441 cell were enhanced in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells. Western blot showed that the expression of a-ENaC was significantly elevated in 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mouse lungs and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated H441 cells. These observations suggest that vitamin D augments transalveolar fluid clearance, and vitamin D therapy may potentially be used to ameliorate pulmonary edema.
