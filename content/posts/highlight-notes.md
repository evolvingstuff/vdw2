 **Notes on what might be added to [Overview of VitaminDWiki](/posts/overview-of-vitamindwiki)** 

* Vitamin D levels have fallen a lot in recent decades with people indoors more.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; and reductions of vitamin D in food and reductions in Omega-3 and Magnesium

* Now many people are deficient, which leads to increased health problems

* No one size dose of Vitamin D is best for everyone

> &nbsp; &nbsp; A basic dose of 4,000 IU daily or 50,000 IU every two weeks for a healthy adult.

> &nbsp; &nbsp;(I happen to take 10,000 IU daily and have 100 nanogram/mL vitamin D level)

* More if obese, dark skin, senior, ill, pregnant, having surgery  . . . . . 

* More to have a chance of treating a health problem– Multiple Sclerosis is a good example

* More if have a vitamin D related health problem, and you which to prevent additional problems

* More if health problem runs in family, since genes decrease benefit of vitamin D

* Daily dosing is probably best – but dosing once per 2 weeks seems perfectly OK, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; and costs only about 2 cents per day

* Can put vitamin D doses which you should take in a monthly container 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; No need to worry if you have forgotten to take some doses - just finish the amount by end of month

* Take with largest meal of the day (longest time to stay in the gut to be adsorbed)

* Many different forms are available: pill, powder, liquid, spray, topical, vegan, Halal, Kosher, etc.

* There are hundreds of suppliers of Vitamin D on the internet.

* Huge contention as to which vitamin D level is best: 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, 100, 150 nanograms/milliter

* [Cofactors](/posts/vitamin-d-cofactors-in-a-nutshell), such as  Magnesium, Omega-3, Vitamin K2, are desired, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; andare  required if Vitamin D level is greater than about 35 nanograms/mL. 

* An initial larger dose of vitamin D, such as 200,000 to 400,000 IU will give you a much faster responce - days instead of months.

> &nbsp; &nbsp; A loading dose is especially needed if:you

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are pregnant, have scheduled surgery, have medical emergency, 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you want to feel the benefit  before you stop taking the  vitamin D in a few months

* Loading dose  needs to followed up with maintenance dosing - probably for the rest of your life

> &nbsp; &nbsp; No worry about toxicity of Loading Doses - over 10,000,000 loading doses have been given without problems

* Toxicity is extremely rare 

* Hundreds of intervention trials and randomized controlled trials have proven the benefits of vitamin D

* Avoid Vitamin D2 - it should not be given to any mammal, but doctors continue to prescribe it.

* Test results  differences of 5 ng do not matter - e.g. anything in 40-50 nanogram/mL:range is fine
