Abstract

Background and aims

Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics.

Methods

205 CD patients of a referral hospital were enrolled between januari 1998-January 2010 when measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. 

 **In osteopenic patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500–1000 mg) were prescribed.** 

Results

Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 ± 0.16 gram/cm2 in lumbar spine and 0.87 ± 0.12 gram/cm2 in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4 years (IQR 3–6). A mean annual increase of + 0.76% (95%CI: ? 2.63%; + 3.87%) in lumbar spine and + 0.43% (95%CI: ? 2.65% ; + 1.11%) in total hip was observed.

Conclusions

Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment of CD.

Abstract
Background and aims
Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is common in Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) patients. This paper reports on the prevalence of decreased BMD in a referral cohort study of CD-patients next to the change of BMD over time in relation with CD-associated clinical characteristics.

Methods
205 CD patients of a referral hospital were enrolled between januari 1998-January 2010 when measurement of BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was available. Follow-up DXA scan was performed in subjects with known risk factors besides Crohn indicative for low BMD. Treatment of CD patients was according to a protocol which is comparable to the current (inter)national guidelines. 
__In osteopenic patients, supplemental vitamin D (800 IU) and Calcium (500–1000 mg) were prescribed.__

Results
Mean BMD at baseline was 0.97 ± 0.16 gram/cm2 in lumbar spine and 0.87 ± 0.12 gram/cm2 in the total hip. At baseline, higher age and low Body Mass Index (BMI), were negatively correlated with BMD. Eighty-four patients underwent a second BMD assessment with a median interval period of 4 years (IQR 3–6). A mean annual increase of + 0.76% (95%CI: ? 2.63%; + 3.87%) in lumbar spine and + 0.43% (95%CI: ? 2.65% ; + 1.11%) in total hip was observed.

Conclusions
Higher age, male sex, low BMI, and a higher age at diagnosis of CD were associated with low BMD. Follow-up of BMD in CD patients showed a contraintuitive small increase of BMD at lumbar spine and total hip in CD patients only using supplemental vitamin D and calcium next to strict treatment of CD.
