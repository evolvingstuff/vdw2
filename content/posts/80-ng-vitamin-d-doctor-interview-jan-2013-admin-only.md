This is a rough draft. There will be extensive re-writing, deleting, re-arranging

 **Recently retired Family Practice physician in Jan 2013 telephone interview by Henry Lahore of VitaminDWiki** 

He started a family practice which expanded to having 8,000 patients, most of whom now have vitamin D level 80 ng ± 10 ng. 

<a href="/posts/grassrootshealth" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 3614">Grassrootshealth</a> provided him with the target of 80 ng of vitamin D

He started with vitamin D in 2007 and wants to remain anonymous

Of the first 1,500 patients he tested, 40% began with vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL and 70% less than 35 ng/mL. Only 1% initially had values within his target range.

He found that to achieve a serum level of 80 ± 10 ng the dose varied a lot with the person. 

When combined with supplemental magnesium, vitamin D repletion has dramatically changed my practice quote from internet

(In order of frequency of use: Vitamin D, Magnesium, Iodine, Vitamin C)

### Typically they have 3 vitamin D blood tests per patient.

1. Initial, 

1. Mid-way to confirm that the dose is high enough, 

1. Final during ma intenance phase.

### Need >2,000 IU for quick positive feedback

He, like others, found few health benefits for <2,000IU of vitamin D

Patients found that there were very quick health benefits with a dose of 10,000 IU a day.  

Almost every patient noticed improvement within a few weeks

He found that patient compliance was high – due to the fast positive feedback.

### Loading dose in a few situations

He uses loading dose only in life threatening situations – example septic

Patients was on Steroids and had vitamin D level of 37 ng

Used a loading dose of 200,000 IU with 50,000 a day every 6 days , then 10,000 daily for 4 weeks.

Patient was able to achieve a vitamin D level of 90 ng

### Magnesium is very important – for Asthma, etc.

High dose vitamin D WITH Magnesium  was found to be very good for Asthma. 

Not only did he eliminate current asthma in his patients, but none of his patients developed asthma in the future. 

Thus asthma was both treated and prevented with 80 ng of vitamin D + Magnesium.

People with Asthma became wheeze free very quickly with Epson Salt Bath (Magnesium Sulfate).  Epson salt several times a week is very easy way to get Magnesium into the body.

### Dosing with 5,000 IU capsules

He changes Vitamin D dose frequency to change the average dose, rather than changing individual dose size (typically 5,000 IU)

The usual dose frequency is more often than once a week with 5,000 IU.

He usually avoids 50,000 IU capsules as he does not want too much oscillation in the vitamin D in the blood stream 

– primarily because he does not want to have a blood test be high or low due to how long it had been since the last dose.

### Extreme vitamin D deficiency in obese blacks

In only 12 of his 8,000 patients was the vitamin D level undetectable.  Generally undetectability was for obese blacks<span style="color:#00F;">{Note: these patients are in two of the high-risk categories}</span>

### Vitamin D and Magnesium treats sickle cell in blacks.

One African-American had 2-3 episodes of pain every week for all of his life.  He had gotten so bad that he had to drop out of the University and had a difficult time keeping his job.  This doctor gives a loading dose of vitamin D only in cases where the patient is very deficient.  This was one such case.  After a  50,000 IU vitamin D loading dose the patient had no pain in just 12 hours. 2 weeks later the patient still had no sickle cell episodes, which was the first 2 week pain free time in his life.  Sickel cell especially causes Magesium levels to go extremely low in the blood.  Later, when the patient forgot to take his maintenance dose of vitamin D for a few months, the pain returned. The pain went away again when he recommenced the vitamin D. {No comment on Magnesium followup}

### 100% of his Lupus patients were cured with Vitamin D.

With Lupus the blood marker easily shows the effect of the vitamin D.  

The Lupus blood marker has a 30 day half-life, so it was easy for him to estimate how much longer the Lupus would exist with the current dose level.

### Iodine especially important for skin, nails, and hair

He found that nails grew twice as fast with Iodine. Vitamin D, C, E also helped

Lupus skin helped with Vitamin D, help more with Iodine,   

### One patient needed a lot of Vitamin C.

He kept increasing the vitamin C dose. 12 grams total for the day was enough. 

Some underlining process was using up the Vitamin C. He needed to add it at least 3 times per day,

### Office visits from 4 per year to one per year with vitamin D and Magnesium

Most doctors have 2,000 _– 500 patients

He found that after recommending vitamin D, etc. that his office visits no longer filled.   **He noticed that patients visits dropped from 4 per year to about 1 per year.**  

He had to open his practice to new patients several times per year. {Unfortunately doctors are rarely paid by insurance, etc. for taking on a new patient, 

### US military and NASA still ignoring Vitamin D

He has noticed that the military seem to ignore the need for vitamin D – especially during basic training.  Example: Navy Seals – 1 femur fracture per class.  

They have months of training without being permitted supplements.  

It may even be a court martial offense to get a suntan during basic training {checked later: probably court martial offense to get a sunburn}. 

### He got the Coast Guard into Vitamin D

Coast Guard top medical professionals listened to Dr. M in two presentations. 

They measured 600 of their new recruits, and, no surprise, they were the same as civilians.  

The Coast Guard the added D and found great improvement, 

The Coast Guard then had all recruits to use vitamin D.  Results: Fewer on sick call, almost no flu. 

### Vitamin D reference ranges have risen in the past few years

QUEST in 2007: 12-50 ng, by 2008 the reference range was 20-80 ng. 

Just a year later, 2009, it was 30-100 ng. 

The next year, 2010, the range was still 30-100 ng, but with a note that < 50 ng was suboptimal

Note: in 2013 [Quest](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/BUOrderInfo.action?tc=17306X&labCode=QUL%20) states that <30 ng is suboptimal} [CLICK HERE](http://cclnprod.cc.nih.gov/dlm/testguide.nsf/Index/353F860EA5F1704585256BA700666862?OpenDocument%20) for history of reference ranges

### Hyperperathryoidism

He was careful with 1% of his patients who were determined to have <a href="/posts/hyperperathryoidism" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 956">hyperperathryoidism</a>.

<span style="color:#00F;">{There is a controversy that this disease causes Calcium levels in the urine to increase a lot with the addition of vitamin D.}.</span>

He tests Calcium levels of the patients, but excess Calcium due to vitamin D is rarely (1%?) a problem

### Wound healing

Generally use: Vitamin D, Vitamin C, and Magesium.

### Vitamin D only works under if:

1. Get it out of pharmacy

1. Get it out of the bottle, 

1. Get it into the body.

### Supplements are like a team sport.

They have to play together properly to win the game

### He is happy that Vitamin D is finally being discussed.

Example: Clinical Advisor is  a 1700 page book which costs $225 1700. 

Previous editions only mentioned rickets. Nothing about vitamins or even scurvy   

The 2013 edition of the book finally discusses nutrient deficiency and vitamin D

### It you take it on just one day a week, let it be SUNday

## It is mentioned in the Bible

In the old testament, Genesis. 

Let there be light. . . .  Said it is good.

### He had little direct experience with Pregnancy:

Due to the doubling of the cost of malpractice insurance if a doctor deals with pregnancies he transferred out any mothers-to-be out of his practice.  

He did notice, however, that the women had less preeclampsia and had healthier infants with Vitamin D & Magnesium.  

He was sad to find that some of the doctors dealing with the referred pregnancies dropped the mothers-to-be vitamin D doses to a 2,000 IU daily.

### He learned about nutrients in pharmacy, before Med School

He learned about the importance of nutrients, and not just nutrients as monotherapy

### National African-American Doctors Organization

The current president of the National Medical Association (a group concerned with health of African-Americans) is Dr. Rahn Bailey;  

He apparently had wanted to focus the group on vitamin D, but backed off , perhaps due to big pharma.  

However, Dr. Rahn Bailey has a special interest in reducing mental illness of African-Americans, so it might be possible to get his interested in Vitamin D from that viewpoint.

### OPKO vitamin D tester

OPKO is making a small vitamin D tester which can give the results in 10 minutes. 

The hope to have US approval of the blood tester in 2013

### Bird Flu .

Why the queston: Why never see flu in July?

Answer. Immune system intact during the summer

So as to minimize pushback he recommends vitamin D before the vaccine - to energize the immune system

### Vitamin C

Why does extra sugar cause the heart problems?  Diabetics pee out Vitamin D and Vitamin C.  

If you have low C the body is not able to repair (build colagen). 

Analogy: College student will use a can of spackle as a quick fix for a wall.  Cholesterol is like the spackle, a quick fix.  

But unfortunately Calcium re-inforces the Cholesterol, similar to re-bar in concrete. 

Guinee pig cannot make vitamin C, and will die in 2 weeks from scurvey from lack of vitamin C.   

Humans and primates also need vitamin C. 

Smoking 1/2 pack of cigarettes results in the loss of 250 milligrams of Vitamin C.  

Diabetics not heal well, Smokers not heal well.  Collagen uses vitamin C in 5 steps. 

### His target range of 80 ng is based upon several factors:

* A lifeguard study that found vitamin D levels in the 70 ng/mL range up to 100 ng/mL (nature’s level) were associated with no adverse effects;

* Data in patients with breast cancer showing a reduction in the incidence of new cancer with postulated 0 point at 80 ng/mL;

* Colon cancer data showing a reduction in the incidence of new cancer (linear) with postulated 0 point at 75 ng/mL;

* More than 200 polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor requiring higher D levels to attain same desired outcomes;

* When a patient misses dosing, an attained level of 80 ng/mL gives the patient an additional month of good levels off of vitamin D.

### Misc notes - each need to be augmented or deleted

UTI  Vitamin D + Iodine ==> urine concentration

Acne was helped with vitamins D & C

ZRT test  and full vitamin D for the year. < cost of vaccine

Vitamin D helps innate and additive immunity

Ophra is very positive about vitamin D – along with Montel Williams. 

Seattle MS highest in US

### Possible problem for doctors who get their patients on high level of vitamin D - fewer visits

The high level of vitamin D reduced patient visits from 4 per year to 1 per year. 

This is a big problem for doctors that are only for treatment.  

It causes doctors to have to add many new patients, and if the docotr is not in an HMO or a country which pays for all medical expenses, adding each new customer/patient causes loss of income for a doctor.

### Considering inteviewing many more doctors with the following topics

What is the target vitamin D level

How much IU needed to get to the level

% of time that Loading dose was needed

Maint dose range

Diseases I have found that it particularly works well with

How quickly patients feel the benefits (positive feedback)

Needed/prescribe cofactors

How many years have you been recommending vitamin D.

Has your target level for vitamin D gone up over time

Do you change the target level with season?

Comments on need of vitamin D for people with dark skins

Have you noticed a decrease in # of patient visits per year

Please describe any adverse effects, short term and long term

What are the risks (to patient, to doctor (reduced # of office visits), legal,  . . . )

Do you have a Web page on vitamin D

How many people, how long of time

Which other supplements do you typically use?

How often are tests needed?  Testing for Vitamin D, Magnesium, Calcium,  . . . 

How many other patients (other than your own) are you aware of that also have a high level of vitamin D

When can use vitamin D as a mono-therapy 

When to use vitamin D to augment conventional drugs

Any recommendation of UV, or sunshine?

### Dr Grant proposed the following questions

May I use your responses on my website?

What sources do you use and/or trust regarding the health benefits of vitamin D?

What is the age range of your patients?

Have you found that raising 25OHD levels late in life cannot reduce some of the adverse effects of vitamin D earlier in life such as osteoporosis?

Where is your practice located and how easy is it for your patients to get vitamin D from solar UVB?

Do you think your patients are typical of people living in your city/town?

Have you experienced any adverse comments regarding use of vitamin D in your practice?

### Goal of these future interviews – varies with the reader

* Doctors = MD, Nurse, Pharmacist, and other medical professionals

> In private practice, hospital, HMO, etc.

> IN US and in many other countries

* Doctors who already prescribe vitamin D

* Doctors who are considering prescribing vitamin D

* Doctors open to thinking about vitamin D

* Patients who are already taking lots of vitamin D

> both prevention and treatment

* Patients who are considering taking vitamin D

---

### Might post these questions and have any doctor send in their answers by email
