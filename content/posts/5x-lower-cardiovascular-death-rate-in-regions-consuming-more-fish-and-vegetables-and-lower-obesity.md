#### Global Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases and Risks, 1990-2022

J Am Coll Cardiol. 2023 Dec 19;82(25):2350â€“2473. [doi: 10.1016/j.jacc.2023.11.007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.11.007)

Age-standardized CVD mortality rates by region ranged from 

* 73.6 per 100,000 in High-income Asia Pacific to 

* 432.3 per 100,000 in Eastern Europe in 2022. 

Global CVD mortality decreased by 34.9% from 1990 to 2022. Ischemic heart disease had the highest global age-standardized DALYs of all diseases at 2,275.9 per 100,000. Intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke were the next highest CVD causes for age-standardized DALYs. Age-standardized CVD prevalence ranged from 5,881.0 per 100,000 in South Asia to 11,342.6 per 100,000 in Central Asia. High systolic blood pressure accounted for the largest number of attributable age-standardized CVD DALYs at 2,564.9 per 100,000 globally. Of all risks, household air pollution from solid fuels had the largest change in attributable age-standardized DALYs from 1990 to 2022 with a 65.1% decrease.

##### Note: Wild fatty fish have a lot of Omega-3. Farmed fish have far less

##### Note: Omega-6 in seed oils block Omega-3, US consumes  2X to 4X more seed oils than Japan

##### Note: Leading cause of deaths for decades: US: Cardiovascular  Japan: Cancer
