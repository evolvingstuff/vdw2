#### Oral vitamin D supplementation and body weight in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials

Eur J Pediatr. 2023 Mar 1. [doi: 10.1007/s00431-023-04889-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-023-04889-2)

This study was designed to ascertain whether oral vitamin D supplementation (oral supplementation and fortified foods) is associated with changes in body weight measures in children and adolescents, using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to October 28, 2022. The mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of interested outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Twenty-one RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and the results showed a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) following vitamin D supplementation in children and adolescents (n = 9 studies, 1029 participants; weighted mean difference: - 0.43 kg/m2, 95% CI: - 0.79, - 0.08; P = 0.02; I2 = 58.5%). Overall, oral vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on body weight and other anthropometric indices, including fat mass, lean mass, waist circumference, BMI Z-score, and height. Although results of body weight changed to significant after sensitivity analysis (WMD = 0.39 kg, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.78; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.71), we also found significant weight gain in healthy pediatric population, and when the dose of vitamin D supplementation was up to 600 IU/day, the certainty of evidence was very low for weight, moderate for height and BMI, and low for the remaining outcomes.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that vitamin D supplementation may lead to a statistically significant weight gain in children and adolescents, while BMI was reduced. Although no significant change was observed in height, it seems vitamin D supplementation may elicit these changes by increasing skeletal growth; however, this remains to be verified. Further high-quality RCTs, with longer duration and larger sample sizes, are needed to yield more certain evidence in this regard.

This study was designed to ascertain whether oral vitamin D supplementation (oral supplementation and fortified foods) is associated with changes in body weight measures in children and adolescents, using a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to October 28, 2022. The mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of interested outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Twenty-one RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, and the results showed a significant decrease in body mass index (BMI) following vitamin D supplementation in children and adolescents (n = 9 studies, 1029 participants; weighted mean difference: - 0.43 kg/m2, 95% CI: - 0.79, - 0.08; P = 0.02; I2 = 58.5%). Overall, oral vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on body weight and other anthropometric indices, including fat mass, lean mass, waist circumference, BMI Z-score, and height. Although results of body weight changed to significant after sensitivity analysis (WMD = 0.39 kg, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.78; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%, P-heterogeneity = 0.71), we also found significant weight gain in healthy pediatric population, and when the dose of vitamin D supplementation was up to 600 IU/day, the certainty of evidence was very low for weight, moderate for height and BMI, and low for the remaining outcomes.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that vitamin D supplementation may lead to a statistically significant weight gain in children and adolescents, while BMI was reduced. Although no significant change was observed in height, it seems vitamin D supplementation may elicit these changes by increasing skeletal growth; however, this remains to be verified. Further high-quality RCTs, with longer duration and larger sample sizes, are needed to yield more certain evidence in this regard.
