#### Vitamin K Intake in Chronic Stroke: Implications for Dietary Recommendations - Oct 2020

Nutrients 2020, 12(10), 3059; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12103059

Previous research has identified a possible association between vitamin K intake and cardiometabolic disease. This could mean that the assessment of vitamin K intake is a meaningful tool when monitoring individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Sixty chronic stroke survivors (men and women, body mass index (BMI) 30.36 ± 6.61 kg/m2, age 61.7 ± 7.2 years) completed food records which were analyzed for energy, macronutrient, micronutrient, and food group servings. Participants were divided into two groups: below vitamin K recommendation (BEL, n = 49) and met vitamin K recommendation (MET, n = 11). Energy and macronutrient intake did not differ between groups (all p > 0.127). Vegetable intake was higher in the MET group (p = 0.0001). Vitamin K intake was higher in the MET group (p = 0.0001). Calcium (p = 0.003), vitamin A (p = 0.007), and vitamin E (p = 0.005) intakes were higher in the MET group. There were no differences in sodium, potassium, vitamin D, vitamin C, and iron intakes between groups (all p > 0.212). In this sample of chronic stroke survivors, 82% reported consuming below the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin K. Given that the majority of this study population did not reach the DRI for vitamin K, it is advisable to promote the adequate intake of food rich in vitamin K. Further work is needed to determine the significance of low vitamin K intake in this population.

Due to vitamin K’s potential therapeutic interactions with various diseases, controlled supplementation may be indicated for individuals struggling to consume adequate amounts. Vitamin K supplementation should be considered as a potential adjuvant therapy to address atherosclerosis. Patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors and a desire to improve vascular condition should first discuss the benefits and risks of vitamin K supplementation with their medical care provider. These discussions are most relevant in patients on anticoagulants, such as warfarin or coumadin"

#### Vitamin K2—a neglected player in cardiovascular health: a narrative review - Oct 2021

Vitamin K2 serves an important role in cardiovascular health through regulation of calcium homeostasis. Its effects on the cardiovascular system are mediated through activation of the anti-calcific protein known as matrix Gla protein. In its inactive form, this protein is associated with various markers of cardiovascular disease including increased arterial stiffness, vascular and valvular calcification, insulin resistance and heart failure indices which ultimately increase cardiovascular mortality. Supplementation of vitamin K2 has been strongly associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes through its modification of systemic calcification and arterial stiffness. Although its direct effects on delaying the progression of vascular and valvular calcification is currently the subject of multiple randomised clinical trials, prior reports suggest potential improved survival among cardiac patients with vitamin K2 supplementation. Strengthened by its affordability and Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA)-proven safety, vitamin K2 supplementation is a viable and promising option to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

#### Quantifying dietary vitamin K and its link to cardiovascular health: a narrative review	- 2020

Claire R. Palmer,ab   Lauren C. Blekkenhorst,bc   Joshua R. Lewis,bcd   Natalie C. Ward, ORCID logo ce   Carl J. Schultz,cf   Jonathan M. Hodgson,bc   Kevin D. Croft ORCID logo a  and  Marc Sim ORCID logo *bc  

Food & Function Issue 4, 2020 DOI	https://doi.org/10.1039/C9FO02321F

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Recent work suggests a link between vitamin K insufficiency and deficiency with vascular calcification, a marker of advanced atherosclerosis. Vitamin K refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins important for blood coagulation, reducing inflammation, regulating blood calcium metabolism, as well as bone metabolism, all of which may play a role in promoting cardiovascular health. Presently, there is a lack of a comprehensive vitamin K database on individual foods, which are required to accurately calculate vitamin K1 and K2 intake for examination in epidemiological studies. This has likely contributed to ambiguity regarding the recommended daily intake of vitamin K, including whether vitamin K1 and K2 may have separate, partly overlapping functions. This review will discuss the presence of: (i) vitamin K1 and K2 in the diet; (ii) the methods of quantitating vitamin K compounds in foods; and (iii) provide an overview of the evidence for the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin K in observational and clinical trials.

!!!!Vitamin K Intake in Chronic Stroke: Implications for Dietary Recommendations - Oct 2020
Nutrients 2020, 12(10), 3059; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12103059

Previous research has identified a possible association between vitamin K intake and cardiometabolic disease. This could mean that the assessment of vitamin K intake is a meaningful tool when monitoring individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Sixty chronic stroke survivors (men and women, body mass index (BMI) 30.36 ± 6.61 kg/m2, age 61.7 ± 7.2 years) completed food records which were analyzed for energy, macronutrient, micronutrient, and food group servings. Participants were divided into two groups: below vitamin K recommendation (BEL, n = 49) and met vitamin K recommendation (MET, n = 11). Energy and macronutrient intake did not differ between groups (all p &gt; 0.127). Vegetable intake was higher in the MET group (p = 0.0001). Vitamin K intake was higher in the MET group (p = 0.0001). Calcium (p = 0.003), vitamin A (p = 0.007), and vitamin E (p = 0.005) intakes were higher in the MET group. There were no differences in sodium, potassium, vitamin D, vitamin C, and iron intakes between groups (all p &gt; 0.212). In this sample of chronic stroke survivors, 82% reported consuming below the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin K. Given that the majority of this study population did not reach the DRI for vitamin K, it is advisable to promote the adequate intake of food rich in vitamin K. Further work is needed to determine the significance of low vitamin K intake in this population.

&quot;More information is needed to better understand whether __vitamin K intake could be used as an easy predictive marker for a secondary stroke__. Due to vitamin K’s potential therapeutic interactions with various diseases, controlled supplementation may be indicated for individuals struggling to consume adequate amounts. Vitamin K supplementation should be considered as a potential adjuvant therapy to address atherosclerosis. Patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors and a desire to improve vascular condition should first discuss the benefits and risks of vitamin K supplementation with their medical care provider. These discussions are most relevant in patients on anticoagulants, such as warfarin or coumadin&quot;

!!!!Vitamin K2—a neglected player in cardiovascular health: a narrative review - Oct 2021
Open Heart - BMJ http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2021-001715

Vitamin K2 serves an important role in cardiovascular health through regulation of calcium homeostasis. Its effects on the cardiovascular system are mediated through activation of the anti-calcific protein known as matrix Gla protein. In its inactive form, this protein is associated with various markers of cardiovascular disease including increased arterial stiffness, vascular and valvular calcification, insulin resistance and heart failure indices which ultimately increase cardiovascular mortality. Supplementation of vitamin K2 has been strongly associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes through its modification of systemic calcification and arterial stiffness. Although its direct effects on delaying the progression of vascular and valvular calcification is currently the subject of multiple randomised clinical trials, prior reports suggest potential improved survival among cardiac patients with vitamin K2 supplementation. Strengthened by its affordability and Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA)-proven safety, vitamin K2 supplementation is a viable and promising option to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Recent work suggests a link between vitamin K insufficiency and deficiency with vascular calcification, a marker of advanced atherosclerosis. Vitamin K refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins important for blood coagulation, reducing inflammation, regulating blood calcium metabolism, as well as bone metabolism, all of which may play a role in promoting cardiovascular health. Presently, there is a lack of a comprehensive vitamin K database on individual foods, which are required to accurately calculate vitamin K1 and K2 intake for examination in epidemiological studies. This has likely contributed to ambiguity regarding the recommended daily intake of vitamin K, including whether vitamin K1 and K2 may have separate, partly overlapping functions. This review will discuss the presence of: (i) vitamin K1 and K2 in the diet; (ii) the methods of quantitating vitamin K compounds in foods; and (iii) provide an overview of the evidence for the cardiovascular health benefits of vitamin K in observational and clinical trials.
