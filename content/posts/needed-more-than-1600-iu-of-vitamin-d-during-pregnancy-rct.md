Introduction: The exact amount of vitamin D required for pregnant women to adequately supply the foetus during pregnancy is still unclear. This randomised trial attempted to determine the optimal dose of vitamin D necessary during pregnancy in order to attain a vitamin D level > 20 ng/mL in neonates. 

Methods: A total of 51 healthy, pregnant women in Yazd, Iran, were recruited in 2009. Of these, 34 were randomised to receive either 

* 50,000 IU (Group A ) or 

* 100,000 IU (Group B ) of vitamin D3 

per month from the second trimester of pregnancy. 

The remaining 17 pregnant women, who formed the third group 

* (Group C) and were found to have vitamin D deficiency, were initially treated with 200,000 IU of vitamin D3, 

> following which the dose was adjusted to 50,000 IU per month. 

25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) in cord blood was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay, and a serum 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL was defined as deficiency. 

Results: All the pregnant women had a vitamin D level < 30 ng/mL at the beginning of the second trimester. 

The neonates of 76% of women from Group A had sufficient levels of 25(OH)D. 

All the neonates born to women in Groups B and C had 25(OH)D > 20 ng/mL. 

No side effects were observed in our participants during the period of vitamin D supplementation. 

Conclusion: A vitamin D3 dose > 50,000 IU/month is required during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy for vitamin D-deficient pregnant women in order for their neonates to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels > 20 ng/mL. 

 **Supplementation with < 50,000 IU/month is insufficient to ensure a vitamin D level > 20 ng/mL in all neonates born to vitamin D-deficient pregnant women.**
