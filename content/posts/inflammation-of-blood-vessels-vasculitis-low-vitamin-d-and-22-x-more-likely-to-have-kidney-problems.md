#### Vitamin D levels in patients with small and medium vessel vasculitis

Reumatol Clin (Engl Ed) . 2022 Mar;18(3):141-146. [doi: 10.1016/j.reumae.2020.11.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reumae.2020.11.004) - behind paywall

Objectives: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with small and medium vessel systemic vasculitis.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D3 levels were measured in adult patients with systemic small and medium vessel vasculitis including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV), cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis (CryV), IgA vasculitis (IgAV) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), and age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (HS) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as control groups. 25OH vitamin D3 levels<30ng/ml and <20ng/ml were regarded as insufficiency and deficiency, respectively.

Results: Fifty-seven patients (42 AAV, 2 CryV, 8 IgA vasculitis, 5 PAN) with systemic vasculitis, 101 HS, and 111 RA patients were included. The mean 25OH vitamin D3 level was 

* 21.8±14.2ng/mL in patients with vasculitis, 

* 42.7±27.6ng/mL in HS (p<.001) and 

* 20.1±18.47ng/mL in patients with RA (p=.54). 

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were significantly higher in patients with systemic vasculitis compared to HS (75.4% vs 33.7%, p<.001; %50 vs 21.8%, p<.001, respectively). 

Vitamin D status was not different in patients with systemic vasculitis compared to RA. There was a negative correlation between vitamin D status and CRP levels (=-.364, p=.007). 

The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that renal involvement was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in patients with  **vasculitis (OR 22.5**  <span>[95% CI 1.6-128.9]</span>.

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are more frequent in patients with systemic small and medium vessel vasculitis and RA than HS. Renal involvement is one of the factors associated with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in patients with vasculitis.

 **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasculitis) March 2022** 

* "Vasculitis is a group of disorders that destroy blood vessels by inflammation.<sup>[2]</sup> Both arteries and veins are affected. Lymphangitis (inflammation of lymphatic vessels) is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis.<sup>[3]</sup> Vasculitis is primarily caused by leukocyte migration and resultant damage. Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins (phlebitis) or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities."

* According to the size of the vessel affected, vasculitis can be classified into:<sup>[7]</sup><sup>[8]</sup>

   * Large vessel: Takayasu's arteritis, Temporal arteritis

   * Medium vessel: Buerger's disease, Kawasaki disease, Polyarteritis nodosa

   * Small vessel: Behçet's syndrome, Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Cutaneous vasculitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, and microscopic polyangiitis.
