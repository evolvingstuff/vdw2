Minerals are essential nutrients that play critical roles in human health by regulating various physiological functions. Examples include bone development, enzyme function, nerve signaling, and the immune response. Both the deficiencies and toxicities of minerals can have significant health implications. Deficiencies in macrominerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphate can lead to osteoporosis (associated with falls and fractures), cardiovascular events, and neuromuscular dysfunction. Trace mineral deficiencies, such as iron and zinc. Selenium deficiency impairs oxygen transport, immune function, and antioxidant defenses, contributing to anemia, delaying wound healing, and increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases. Conversely, excessive intake of minerals can have severe health consequences. Hypercalcemia can cause kidney stones and cardiac arrhythmias as well as soft-tissue calcification, whereas excessive iron deposition can lead to oxidative stress and organ/tissue damage. Maintaining adequate mineral levels through a balanced diet, guided supplementation, and monitoring at-risk populations is essential for good health and preventing disorders related to deficiencies and toxicities. Public health interventions and education about dietary sources of minerals are critical for minimizing health risks and ensuring optimal well-being across populations. While a comprehensive analysis of all macro and micronutrients is beyond the scope of this article, we have chosen to focus on calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. We summarize the consequences of deficiency and the adverse events associated with the overconsumption of other minerals.

#### Perplexity AI summary Jan 2025

This comprehensive review article, published on January 26, 2025, 

examines the critical roles of minerals in human health, 

focusing on both deficiency and toxicity aspects. 

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Key Findings</span>** 

The study primarily focuses on three essential minerals:

*  **Calcium** : Critical for bone health, muscle contraction, and nerve signaling

*  **Magnesium** : Essential for enzyme function, cellular signaling, and vitamin D metabolism

*  **Phosphate** : Vital for ATP production, cell membranes, and bone mineralization

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Clinical Implications</span>** 

 **Mineral Deficiencies** 

* Iron deficiency affects over 25% of the global population

* Vitamin D deficiency impacts approximately 23% of children in Africa

* Zinc deficiency impairs wound healing and immune function

 **Optimal Balance** 

* The calcium-to-magnesium ratio should ideally be around 2.0

* Western diets typically have higher calcium and lower magnesium content

* Both deficiency and excess can lead to serious health complications

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Health Impact</span>** 

 **Deficiency Consequences** 

* Calcium: Osteoporosis, cardiovascular issues, neuromuscular dysfunction

* Magnesium: Muscle cramps, fatigue, irregular heartbeats

* Phosphate: Impaired ATP production, bone disorders

 **Toxicity Effects** 

* Excess calcium can cause kidney stones and cardiac arrhythmias

* High phosphate levels may lead to cardiovascular calcification

* Mineral toxicity particularly affects children under 6 years of age

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Prevention Strategies</span>** 

The study recommends:

* Maintaining adequate mineral intake through balanced diet

* Guided supplementation when necessary

* Regular monitoring of at-risk populations

* Public health interventions and education about dietary sources
