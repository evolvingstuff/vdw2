Background

Experimental studies have suggested potential detrimental effects of emulsifiers on gut microbiota, inflammation, and metabolic perturbations. We aimed to investigate the associations between exposures to food additive emulsifiers and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a large prospective cohort of French adults.

Methods

We analysed data from 104 139 adults enrolled in the French NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study from May 1, 2009, to April 26, 2023; 82 456 (79·2%) were female and the mean age was 42·7 years (SD 14·5). Dietary intakes were assessed with  **three 24 h dietary records collected over three non-consecutive days, every 6 months.**  Exposure to additive emulsifiers was evaluated through multiple food composition databases and ad-hoc laboratory assays. Associations between cumulative time-dependent exposures to food additive emulsifiers and the risk of type 2 diabetes were characterised with multivariable proportional hazards Cox models adjusted for known risk factors. The NutriNet-Santé study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03335644).

Findings

Of 104 139 participants, 1056 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during follow-up (mean follow-up duration 6·8 years <span>[SD 3·7]</span>). Intakes of the following emulsifiers were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes: total carrageenans (hazard ratio<span>[ [HR]</span> 1·03 <span>[95% CI 1·01–1·05]</span> per increment of 100 mg per day, p<0·0001), carrageenans gum (E407; HR 1·03 <span>[1·01–1·05]</span> per increment of 100 mg per day, p<0·0001), tripotassium phosphate (E340; HR 1·15 <span>[1·02–1·31]</span> per increment of 500 mg per day, p=0·023), acetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472e; HR 1·04 <span>[1·00–1·08]</span> per increment of 100 mg per day, p=0·042), sodium citrate (E331; HR 1·04 <span>[1·01–1·07]</span> per increment of 500 mg per day, p=0·0080), guar gum (E412; HR 1·11 <span>[1·06–1·17]</span> per increment of 500 mg per day, p<0·0001), gum arabic (E414; HR 1·03 <span>[1·01–1·05]</span> per increment of 1000 mg per day, p=0·013), and xanthan gum (E415, HR 1·08 <span>[1·02–1·14]</span> per increment of 500 mg per day, p=0·013).

Interpretation

We found direct associations between the risk of type 2 diabetes and exposures to various food additive emulsifiers widely used in industrial foods, in a large prospective cohort of French adults. Further research is needed to prompt re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of additive emulsifiers in the food industry for better consumer protection.

##### Research in context

Evidence before this study

We did a comprehensive literature search of PubMed from database inception to Sept 25, 2023, for studies published in English and French focusing on the potential effects of food additive emulsifiers on type 2 diabetes. The search terms were “(diabetes or type 2 diabetes or diabetes mellitus)” AND “(food additive emulsifiers or emulsifiers)”. A small number of experimental studies (in vitro, animal, and short-term randomised controlled trials) suggested adverse effects of some emulsifiers such as 

* gut microbiota dysbiosis, 

* inflammation, and 

* metabolic perturbations. 

   * <span style="color:#00F;">(all 3 of which are fought by vitamin D)</span>

Two cohort studies from our group showed associations between exposure to various food additive emulsifiers and 

an increased risk of 

* cardiovascular disease and 

* cancer. 

No such investigation has, to the best of our knowledge, yet been conducted to assess the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Added value of this study

The present study is the first to quantitatively assess exposure to food additive emulsifiers in a large-scale cohort (n=104 139), thereby providing novel insights into the association of emulsifiers with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Sparse details on the specific industrial food products consumed were available in previous epidemiological studies worldwide, but the variation in additive composition is huge for two different brands of the same food item (eg,  **a chocolate biscuit can contain zero to eight different additives** ). Thus, we evaluated the occurrence and dose of exposures to food additive emulsifiers by linking detailed dietary records from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (including commercial names and brands of industrial foods and beverages) to multiple food composition databases, ad-hoc laboratory assays, and dynamic matching to account for reformulations of industrial food items over time. We observed that higher intakes of seven individual emulsifiers (European codes: E407, E340, E472e, E331, E412, E414, and E415) and one emulsifier group (total carrageenans) were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

 **Implications of all the available evidence** 

These findings could have important public health implications given the ubiquitous nature of these food additives used in thousands of widely consumed ultra-processed products ingested daily by millions of children and adults globally. Although additional long-term observational epidemiological studies as well as short-term interventions (for ethical reasons) are needed to confirm these findings, they align with those of previous in-vitro and in-vivo experiments suggesting adverse effects of several emulsifiers.  **Altogether, the available evidence supports a re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of food additive emulsifiers by the food industry for a better consumer protection** . Indeed, current acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) were set up on the basis of classical cytotoxicity and genotoxicity criteria but neither included clinical epidemiological data on hard endpoints (which are missing so far) nor the latest experimental research (eg, on microbiota dysbiosis). As we advance our understanding of the potential role of additives in the development of diabetes, several public health authorities already recommend minimising the consumption of ultra-processed foods in order to lower exposure to controversial so-called cosmetic food additives.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no epidemiological study has quantified dietary exposures to a wide range of food additive emulsifiers and investigated their associations with the risk of type 2 diabetes. This research gap can be explained by the sparse details of specific industrial food products consumed in previous epidemiological studies. Emulsifier composition indeed varies greatly from one industrial product to another, for the same type of food. A chocolate biscuit, for example, could contain zero to eight different emulsifiers, depending on the brand. The NutriNet-Santé cohort has the potential to advance knowledge in this field, since it has collected extensive brand-specific dietary data through validated repeated 24 h dietary records since 2009. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between emulsifier exposure and type 2 diabetes risk in the NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study.

#### Asked Perplexity AI May 2024

##### Do food emulsifiers increase the risk of diabetes?

Based on the search results provided, there is evidence suggesting that consumption of certain food emulsifier additives may be associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The key findings are:

A large prospective cohort study of over 100,000 French adults from the NutriNet-Santé study found that higher intakes of the following emulsifiers were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes:

* Carrageenans (3% increased risk per 100 mg/day increment)

* Tripotassium phosphate (15% increased risk per 500 mg/day)

* Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters (4% increased risk per 100 mg/day)

* Sodium citrate (4% increased risk per 500 mg/day)

* Guar gum (11% increased risk per 500 mg/day)

* Gum arabic (3% increased risk per 1000 mg/day)

* Xanthan gum (8% increased risk per 500 mg/day)

These findings from a large epidemiological study add to previous experimental evidence from cell, animal and human studies suggesting that certain emulsifiers may disrupt the gut microbiota, increase inflammation, and lead to metabolic disturbances like insulin resistance, potentially increasing diabetes risk.

However, it's important to note that this is an observational study, so it cannot prove causation. The authors acknowledge the need for further research to establish causal links and understand the underlying mechanisms . Replication in other epidemiological studies is also needed to strengthen the evidence.

In summary, while not conclusive, this study provides initial epidemiological data indicating that chronic consumption of certain food emulsifier additives may be associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, likely mediated through effects on the gut microbiome and metabolic processes. But more research is still needed.

##### How do emulsifiers affect gut health?

Emulsifiers, commonly used in processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life, have been increasingly scrutinized for their potential impact on gut health. The evidence from various studies suggests that certain emulsifiers can negatively affect the gut microbiome, leading to inflammation and potentially contributing to metabolic and intestinal diseases.

 **Impact on Gut Microbiome** 

1.  **Disruption of Gut Microbiota** :

   * Emulsifiers like carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) have been shown to significantly alter the composition of gut bacteria. These changes often result in a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria.

   * Studies using artificial gut models and animal experiments have demonstrated that these emulsifiers can reduce the diversity of gut microbiota and promote the growth of harmful bacteria that can cross the gut lining, leading to inflammation.

1.  **Intestinal Inflammation** :

   * Emulsifiers can disrupt the protective mucus layer of the gut, making it more permeable and allowing bacteria to invade the gut lining. This can trigger an inflammatory response, which has been linked to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome.

   * In vitro studies have shown that emulsifiers can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 in gut cells, further supporting their role in promoting gut inflammation.

1.  **Metabolic and Chronic Diseases** :

   * There is emerging evidence that emulsifiers may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This is thought to be mediated through their impact on gut microbiota and the resulting low-grade inflammation.

   * Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between high intake of certain emulsifiers and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and other chronic diseases.

 **Specific Emulsifiers of Concern** 

1.  **Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and Polysorbate 80 (P80)** :

   * These emulsifiers have been consistently identified as having the most detrimental effects on gut health. They are associated with significant alterations in gut microbiota composition, increased intestinal permeability, and heightened inflammatory responses.

1.  **Carrageenan** :

   * Carrageenan has been linked to gut inflammation and has been shown to exacerbate conditions like IBD in animal models. Its use in infant formulas has been restricted in some regions due to concerns about its safety.

1.  **Other Emulsifiers** :

   * While not all emulsifiers have the same impact, some, like lecithin, appear to have minimal or no adverse effects on the gut microbiome. However, the overall impact of many emulsifiers remains under-researched, and more studies are needed to fully understand their effects.

 **Recommendations** 

*  **Dietary Choices** :

   * Reducing the intake of processed foods that contain harmful emulsifiers can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Opting for whole foods and checking ingredient labels for emulsifiers like CMC and P80 can be beneficial.

   * Some emulsifiers, such as gum arabic, may have prebiotic effects and could potentially benefit gut health, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.

 **Further Research** :

   * There is a need for more human studies to confirm the findings from animal and in vitro studies. Understanding the long-term effects of emulsifier consumption and identifying safe alternatives are crucial steps forward.

In conclusion, while emulsifiers play a crucial role in the food industry, their potential impact on gut health cannot be overlooked. Certain emulsifiers, particularly CMC and P80, have been shown to disrupt gut microbiota and promote inflammation, which may contribute to various chronic diseases. Reducing the intake of processed foods and opting for emulsifier-free or minimally processed options can help mitigate these risks.

Background
Experimental studies have suggested potential detrimental effects of emulsifiers on gut microbiota, inflammation, and metabolic perturbations. We aimed to investigate the associations between exposures to food additive emulsifiers and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a large prospective cohort of French adults.
Methods
We analysed data from 104 139 adults enrolled in the French NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study from May 1, 2009, to April 26, 2023; 82 456 (79·2%) were female and the mean age was 42·7 years (SD 14·5). Dietary intakes were assessed with __three 24 h dietary records collected over three non-consecutive days, every 6 months.__ Exposure to additive emulsifiers was evaluated through multiple food composition databases and ad-hoc laboratory assays. Associations between cumulative time-dependent exposures to food additive emulsifiers and the risk of type 2 diabetes were characterised with multivariable proportional hazards Cox models adjusted for known risk factors. The NutriNet-Santé study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03335644).
Findings
Of 104 139 participants, 1056 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during follow-up (mean follow-up duration 6·8 years [SD 3·7]). Intakes of the following emulsifiers were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes: total carrageenans (hazard ratio[ [HR] 1·03 [95% CI 1·01–1·05] per increment of 100 mg per day, p&lt;0·0001), carrageenans gum (E407; HR 1·03 [1·01–1·05] per increment of 100 mg per day, p&lt;0·0001), tripotassium phosphate (E340; HR 1·15 [1·02–1·31] per increment of 500 mg per day, p=0·023), acetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides and diglycerides of fatty acids (E472e; HR 1·04 [1·00–1·08] per increment of 100 mg per day, p=0·042), sodium citrate (E331; HR 1·04 [1·01–1·07] per increment of 500 mg per day, p=0·0080), guar gum (E412; HR 1·11 [1·06–1·17] per increment of 500 mg per day, p&lt;0·0001), gum arabic (E414; HR 1·03 [1·01–1·05] per increment of 1000 mg per day, p=0·013), and xanthan gum (E415, HR 1·08 [1·02–1·14] per increment of 500 mg per day, p=0·013).
Interpretation
We found direct associations between the risk of type 2 diabetes and exposures to various food additive emulsifiers widely used in industrial foods, in a large prospective cohort of French adults. Further research is needed to prompt re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of additive emulsifiers in the food industry for better consumer protection.

!!!!!Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a comprehensive literature search of PubMed from database inception to Sept 25, 2023, for studies published in English and French focusing on the potential effects of food additive emulsifiers on type 2 diabetes. The search terms were “(diabetes or type 2 diabetes or diabetes mellitus)” AND “(food additive emulsifiers or emulsifiers)”. A small number of experimental studies (in vitro, animal, and short-term randomised controlled trials) suggested adverse effects of some emulsifiers such as 
*gut microbiota dysbiosis, 
*inflammation, and 
*metabolic perturbations. 
**&#39;&#39;~~#00F:(all 3 of which are fought by vitamin D)~~&#39;&#39;
Two cohort studies from our group showed associations between exposure to various food additive emulsifiers and 
an increased risk of 
*cardiovascular disease and 
*cancer. 
No such investigation has, to the best of our knowledge, yet been conducted to assess the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Added value of this study
The present study is the first to quantitatively assess exposure to food additive emulsifiers in a large-scale cohort (n=104 139), thereby providing novel insights into the association of emulsifiers with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Sparse details on the specific industrial food products consumed were available in previous epidemiological studies worldwide, but the variation in additive composition is huge for two different brands of the same food item (eg, __a chocolate biscuit can contain zero to eight different additives__). Thus, we evaluated the occurrence and dose of exposures to food additive emulsifiers by linking detailed dietary records from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (including commercial names and brands of industrial foods and beverages) to multiple food composition databases, ad-hoc laboratory assays, and dynamic matching to account for reformulations of industrial food items over time. We observed that higher intakes of seven individual emulsifiers (European codes: E407, E340, E472e, E331, E412, E414, and E415) and one emulsifier group (total carrageenans) were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
__Implications of all the available evidence__
These findings could have important public health implications given the ubiquitous nature of these food additives used in thousands of widely consumed ultra-processed products ingested daily by millions of children and adults globally. Although additional long-term observational epidemiological studies as well as short-term interventions (for ethical reasons) are needed to confirm these findings, they align with those of previous in-vitro and in-vivo experiments suggesting adverse effects of several emulsifiers. __Altogether, the available evidence supports a re-evaluation of regulations governing the use of food additive emulsifiers by the food industry for a better consumer protection__. Indeed, current acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) were set up on the basis of classical cytotoxicity and genotoxicity criteria but neither included clinical epidemiological data on hard endpoints (which are missing so far) nor the latest experimental research (eg, on microbiota dysbiosis). As we advance our understanding of the potential role of additives in the development of diabetes, several public health authorities already recommend minimising the consumption of ultra-processed foods in order to lower exposure to controversial so-called cosmetic food additives.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no epidemiological study has quantified dietary exposures to a wide range of food additive emulsifiers and investigated their associations with the risk of type 2 diabetes. This research gap can be explained by the sparse details of specific industrial food products consumed in previous epidemiological studies. Emulsifier composition indeed varies greatly from one industrial product to another, for the same type of food. A chocolate biscuit, for example, could contain zero to eight different emulsifiers, depending on the brand. The NutriNet-Santé cohort has the potential to advance knowledge in this field, since it has collected extensive brand-specific dietary data through validated repeated 24 h dietary records since 2009. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between emulsifier exposure and type 2 diabetes risk in the NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study.

!!!!!Do food emulsifiers increase the risk of diabetes? 
Based on the search results provided, there is evidence suggesting that consumption of certain food emulsifier additives may be associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The key findings are:
 A large prospective cohort study of over 100,000 French adults from the NutriNet-Santé study found that higher intakes of the following emulsifiers were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes:
*Carrageenans (3% increased risk per 100 mg/day increment)
*Tripotassium phosphate (15% increased risk per 500 mg/day)
*Mono- and diacetyltartaric acid esters (4% increased risk per 100 mg/day)
*Sodium citrate (4% increased risk per 500 mg/day)
*Guar gum (11% increased risk per 500 mg/day)
*Gum arabic (3% increased risk per 1000 mg/day)
*Xanthan gum (8% increased risk per 500 mg/day)
 These findings from a large epidemiological study add to previous experimental evidence from cell, animal and human studies suggesting that certain emulsifiers may disrupt the gut microbiota, increase inflammation, and lead to metabolic disturbances like insulin resistance, potentially increasing diabetes risk.
However, it&#39;s important to note that this is an observational study, so it cannot prove causation. The authors acknowledge the need for further research to establish causal links and understand the underlying mechanisms . Replication in other epidemiological studies is also needed to strengthen the evidence.
In summary, while not conclusive, this study provides initial epidemiological data indicating that chronic consumption of certain food emulsifier additives may be associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, likely mediated through effects on the gut microbiome and metabolic processes. But more research is still needed.

!!!!!How do emulsifiers affect gut health? 
Emulsifiers, commonly used in processed foods to improve texture and extend shelf life, have been increasingly scrutinized for their potential impact on gut health. The evidence from various studies suggests that certain emulsifiers can negatively affect the gut microbiome, leading to inflammation and potentially contributing to metabolic and intestinal diseases.
__Impact on Gut Microbiome__
#__Disruption of Gut Microbiota__:
**Emulsifiers like carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate 80 (P80) have been shown to significantly alter the composition of gut bacteria. These changes often result in a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria.
**Studies using artificial gut models and animal experiments have demonstrated that these emulsifiers can reduce the diversity of gut microbiota and promote the growth of harmful bacteria that can cross the gut lining, leading to inflammation.
#__Intestinal Inflammation__:
**Emulsifiers can disrupt the protective mucus layer of the gut, making it more permeable and allowing bacteria to invade the gut lining. This can trigger an inflammatory response, which has been linked to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome.
**In vitro studies have shown that emulsifiers can increase the production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 in gut cells, further supporting their role in promoting gut inflammation.
#__Metabolic and Chronic Diseases__:
**There is emerging evidence that emulsifiers may contribute to the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This is thought to be mediated through their impact on gut microbiota and the resulting low-grade inflammation.
**Epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation between high intake of certain emulsifiers and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and other chronic diseases.
__Specific Emulsifiers of Concern__
#__Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and Polysorbate 80 (P80)__:
**These emulsifiers have been consistently identified as having the most detrimental effects on gut health. They are associated with significant alterations in gut microbiota composition, increased intestinal permeability, and heightened inflammatory responses.
#__Carrageenan__:
**Carrageenan has been linked to gut inflammation and has been shown to exacerbate conditions like IBD in animal models. Its use in infant formulas has been restricted in some regions due to concerns about its safety.
#__Other Emulsifiers__:
**While not all emulsifiers have the same impact, some, like lecithin, appear to have minimal or no adverse effects on the gut microbiome. However, the overall impact of many emulsifiers remains under-researched, and more studies are needed to fully understand their effects.
__Recommendations__
*__Dietary Choices__:
**Reducing the intake of processed foods that contain harmful emulsifiers can help maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Opting for whole foods and checking ingredient labels for emulsifiers like CMC and P80 can be beneficial.
**Some emulsifiers, such as gum arabic, may have prebiotic effects and could potentially benefit gut health, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.
__Further Research__:
**There is a need for more human studies to confirm the findings from animal and in vitro studies. Understanding the long-term effects of emulsifier consumption and identifying safe alternatives are crucial steps forward.
In conclusion, while emulsifiers play a crucial role in the food industry, their potential impact on gut health cannot be overlooked. Certain emulsifiers, particularly CMC and P80, have been shown to disrupt gut microbiota and promote inflammation, which may contribute to various chronic diseases. Reducing the intake of processed foods and opting for emulsifier-free or minimally processed options can help mitigate these risks.
