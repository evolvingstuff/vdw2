**<span style="color:#00F;">Less D in blood & Less D getting from the blood into tissues</span>** 

 **Less D from the SUN** 

Outdoors less for many reasons, such as [Air conditioning](/posts/air-conditioning-probably-has-decreased-vitamin-d)

Instructed to fear skin cancer from the sun

 **Less D from FOOD** 

Less D in chickens, eggs, pork (raised away from the sun)

Less D in fish (>50% of fish now are farmed)

Less D from [skim dairy products](/posts/skim-fat-milk-provides-3-percent-less-vitamin-d)

Less D due to Less cholesterol - which is required to generate Vitamin D from the sun

Less D due to Less Omega-3 in dairy, fish, etc - which decreases Vitamin D in  **tissues** 

Less D due to Less Magnesium in foods - which decreases Vitamin D in blood and   **tissues** 

Less D in  **tissues**  due to [Antibiotics](/tags/antibiotics.html) and [Vaccines](/tags/vaccines.html) allow  poor immune systems to be inherited.

 **Less D due to body restrictions** 

[Obesity](/posts/overview-obesity-and-vitamin-d) results in storing some vitamin D in fat, lowering the blood levels of vitamin D

[5 genes](/tags/5-genes.html) can restrict Vitamin D in blood from getting to  **tissues** 

Some diseases (i.e. [Breast Cancer](/posts/breast-cancer-death-18-x-more-likely-if-poor-vitamin-d-receptor) ) have learned how to de-activate Vitamin D Receptor genes,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thus protecing itself by reducing the amount ot Vitamin D getting to  **tissues**
