Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) remains a significant health challenge globally with its overwhelming effects on skeletal growth and varied associations with extra-skeletal diseases. The last decade has reported a high prevalence of VDD in all age-groups across all zones of India. Children and adolescents are most vulnerable to ill-effects of VDD as peak linear growth and bone mass accrual occurs during these years. Vitamin D deficiency in mothers predisposes their infants to have low serum vitamin D levels. Indians have increased susceptibility to develop VDD due to predominant vegetarian dietary habits, high melanin skin content, atmospheric pollution, modest tradition of clothing and limited availability of fortified foods. Vitamin D supplementation during infancy and childhood has emerged as an effective strategy to combat VDD. However, effects of vitamin D supplementation are transient and are not cost-effective as a maintenance strategy. Fortification of foodstuffs has been adopted by many developed countries globally which has emerged as a safe, efficacious and cost-effective strategy to control VDD. A strong political will and support is required to sustain food fortification in India. The current review focuses on strategies to prevent and control the epidemic of VDD in children.

 **Clipped from conclusion** 

In view of the Indian studies and available world literature documenting the safety and efficacy of vitamin D fortification of milk, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued a notification on 06th December 2016 calling for  **voluntary fortification**  of toned, double toned and skimmed milk with 550 IU of  **ergocalciferol**  per litre and vegetable oils with 4.4–6.4 IU (0.11–0.16μg) of vitamin D per gram of cooking oil <sup>[47]</sup>. It is proposed that this approach will ensure intake of at least 1/3 rd of RDA of vitamin D, assuming 400–500 ml of milk is consumed on daily basis
