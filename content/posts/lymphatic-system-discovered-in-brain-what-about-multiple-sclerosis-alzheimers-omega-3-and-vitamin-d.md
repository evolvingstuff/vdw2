 **“It is unclear what they do—but they likely play a central role in aging and disease."**

* “Doctors practicing today have been taught that there are no lymphatic vessels inside the skull.”

* Senior investigator Daniel Reich, who is very interested in Multiple Sclerosis, followed up on the discovery of lymph system in brains (glymphatic system) of mice in 2015

* “In a 2016 [study (free PDF)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27234656%20), also in mice, glymphatic dysfunction appeared to cause accumulation of Alzheimer-related amyloid proteins.”

* “The flow of glymphatic fluid can change based on a person’s intake of omega-3 fatty acids, a study showed earlier this year.”

> [ **Omega-3**  polyunsaturated fatty acids promote amyloid-β clearance from the brain through mediating the function of the glymphatic system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27789520) (mice) Jan 2017, PDF costs $20

* Long discussion about ALS

* “ALS and Parkinson’s appear to both be fundamentally a result of how tiny vesicles are transported in nerve cells.”

#### [Lymphatic drainage system of the brain: A novel target for intervention of neurological diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28903061) Sept 2017

* “Brain lymphatic drainage helps maintain water and ion balance of the ISF, waste clearance, and reabsorption of macromolecular solutes.”

* “ A second physiological function includes communication with the immune system modulating immune surveillance and responses of the brain”. 

* “The impairment and dysfunction of the brain lymphatic system has crucial roles in age-related changes of brain function and the pathogenesis of neurovascular, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory diseases, as well as brain injury and tumors”

 **Sections of the $36 PDF** 

* 2. Key components of the brain lymphatic drainage system

* 3. Physiological functions and regulatory factors of the brain lymphatic drainage system

* 4. Lymphatic drainage pathway-mediated communications between CNS and immune system

* 5. Pathological significance of dysfunction of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathways in neurologic diseases

* 6. Therapeutic or drug delivery strategies targeting key components of CNS lymphatic drainage pathways in neurological diseases
