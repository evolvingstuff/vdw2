#### Often people taking warfarin are told to reduce vitamin K intake  
!It appears that it exactly the opposite of what should be done

* [Medscape](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/518758) 2000

   * 100 ug of vitamin D appeared to stabilize warfarin use

* [Counadin.com on Vitamin K](http://www.coumadin.com/vitamin_k.aspx)

   * Lots of details of how much vitamin K in different food types

* [ClotCare 2004](http://www.clotcare.com/vitaminkandwarfarin.aspx)

   * Should not reduce vitamin K when taking warfarin – doing so causes problems

* [Linus Pauling Institute](http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminK/)

   * “Warfarin prevents the recycling of vitamin K by inhibiting two important reactions and creating a functional vitamin K deficiency”

   * “Large quantities of dietary or supplemental vitamin K can overcome the anticoagulant effect of vitamin K antagonists, so patients taking these drugs are cautioned against consuming very large or highly variable quantities of vitamin K in their diets (see Drug interactions). Experts now advise a reasonably constant dietary intake of vitamin K that meets current dietary recommendations (90-120 mcg/day) for patients on vitamin K antagonists like warfarin (9).”

* [Wikipedia on Vitamin K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_K)

   * Phylloquinone (K1) or menaquinone (K2) are capable of blocking the blood thinning action of anticoagulants like warfarin, which work by interfering with the action of vitamin K.  They also reverse the tendency of these drugs to cause arterial calcification in the long term.

* We are also not including Vitamin K as patients with CVD or HF often take warfarin for related medical conditions, and Vitamin K can antagonize the action of that medication resulting in harm.

* [Wellness Resources](http://www.wellnessresources.com/studies/entry/how_coumadin_affects_vitamin_k_function) How Coumadin Affects Vitamin K Function 2009?

   * “Doctors are in denial and are making millions of Americans unhealthy in the name of "preventing" a stroke.”
