&lt;p>Previous evidence suggests that higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25&lt;span>[OH]&lt;/span>D) levels are variably associated with lower breast cancer risk; however, prospective studies and clinical trials have been inconsistent, particularly between older and younger women of differing menopausal status. We conducted a quantitative nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies evaluating the association between circulating 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk, stratified by menopause. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE included studies published through May 2011.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer 2X more likely if have taken statins for 10 years</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-2x-more-likely-if-have-taken-statins-for-10-years.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-2x-more-likely-if-have-taken-statins-for-10-years.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="long-term-statin-use-and-risk-of-ductal-and-lobular-breast-cancer-among-women-55-74-years-of-age">Long-term statin use and risk of ductal and lobular breast cancer among women 55-74 years of age.&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>There were some case-control studies, nested case-control studies, and cohort studies with controversial results on the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> and breast cancer risk. Case-control studies are prone to selection bias, which limit the strength and quality of the evidence. To overcome the shortcoming of the case-control studies, the meta-analysis of prospective studies including nested case-control studies and cohort studies was conducted. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched, and the last retrieval date was March 24, 2013. For the highest versus the lowest level of serum 25(OH)D, the relative risks (RRs) and its 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from each study were used to estimate summary RR and its 95 % CI. Subgroup analyses by geographic region, menopausal status, and adjusted status of RR were also performed, respectively. A dose-response association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and breast cancer risk was assessed. Fourteen articles with 9,110 breast cancer cases and 16,244 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, serum 25(OH)D levels were inversely significantly associated with breast cancer risk (RR = 0.845, 95 % CI = 0.750-0.951). Inversely statistically significant associations were observed in North American studies, postmenopausal women, and studies with adjusted and unadjusted RR, respectively. No statistically significant associations were observed in European studies and premenopausal women, respectively.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer survival 2X more likely if vitamin D sufficient – meta-analysis</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-survival-2x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-sufficient-meta-analysis.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-survival-2x-more-likely-if-vitamin-d-sufficient-meta-analysis.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="the-relationship-between-serum-vitamin-d-levels-and-breast-cancer-prognosis-a-meta-analysis">The relationship between serum vitamin D levels and breast cancer prognosis: A meta-analysis.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2900 IU not enough vitamin D to deal with Breast Cancer</title><link>/posts/2900-iu-not-enough-vitamin-d-to-deal-with-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2900-iu-not-enough-vitamin-d-to-deal-with-breast-cancer.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wide variety of data on vitamin D and breast cancer, but still insufficient clinical data</title><link>/posts/wide-variety-of-data-on-vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-but-still-insufficient-clinical-data.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/wide-variety-of-data-on-vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-but-still-insufficient-clinical-data.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-are-we-ready-to-supplement-for-breast-cancer-prevention-and-treatment">Vitamin d: are we ready to supplement for breast cancer prevention and treatment?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Background: Vitamin D plays a role in cancer development and acts through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Although African-Americans have the lowest levels of serum vitamin D, there is a dearth of information on VDR gene polymorphisms and breast cancer among African-Americans and Hispanics. This study examines whether VDR gene polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer in these cohorts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer and long term vitamin D studies</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-and-long-term-vitamin-d-studies.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-and-long-term-vitamin-d-studies.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="long-follow-up-time-after-blood-draw-adversely-affected-this-nested-case-control-study">Long follow-up time after blood draw adversely affected this nested case-control study&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Abstract&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oestrogen and family history are two of the most important risk factors for breast cancer. However, these risk factors cannot explain the differences in the incidence and recurrence of breast cancer between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In this paper I propose that, in premenopausal women, an iron deficiency caused by menstruation stabilises hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha, which increases the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor. This mechanism results in premenopausal women being more susceptible to angiogenesis and, consequently, leads to a high recurrence of breast cancer. Conversely, increased concentrations of iron in postmenopausal women, as a result of menstrual cessation, contribute to a high incidence of breast cancer via oxidative-stress pathways. Although the focus of this Personal View is on iron, this by no means negates the roles of other known risk factors in breast-cancer development. Characterisation of the role of iron in breast cancer could potentially benefit patients by decreasing recurrence and incidence and increasing overall survival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If have breast cancer, should increase vitamin D to more than 30 ng</title><link>/posts/if-have-breast-cancer-should-increase-vitamin-d-to-more-than-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/if-have-breast-cancer-should-increase-vitamin-d-to-more-than-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-and-breast-cancer">Vitamin D and Breast Cancer&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D has also been reported to have anticancer activities against many cancer types, including breast cancer. The discovery that breast epithelial cells possess the same enzymatic system as the kidney, allowing local manufacture of active vitamin D from circulating precursors, makes the effect of vitamin D in breast cancer biologically plausible. Preclinical and ecologic studies have suggested a role for vitamin D in breast cancer prevention. Inverse associations have also been shown between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (25(OH)D) and breast cancer development, risk for breast cancer recurrence, and mortality in women with early-stage breast cancer. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation, however, have yielded inconsistent results. Regardless of whether or not vitamin D helps prevent breast cancer or its recurrence, vitamin D deficiency in the U.S. population is very common, and the adverse impact on bone health, a particular concern for breast cancer survivors, makes it important to understand vitamin D physiology and to recognize and treat vitamin D deficiency. In this review, we discuss vitamin D metabolism and its mechanism of action. We summarize the current evidence of the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer, highlight ongoing research in this area, and discuss optimal dosing of vitamin D for breast cancer prevention.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer chance decreased 16 percent for every extra ng of vitamin D</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-chance-decreased-16-percent-for-every-extra-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-chance-decreased-16-percent-for-every-extra-ng-of-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="higher-blood-25ohd-level-may-reduce-the-breast-cancer-risk">Higher Blood 25(OH)D Level May Reduce the Breast Cancer Risk:&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Calcitriol is the active form of Vitamin D3. Epidemiological data show that women with Vitamin D deficiency at the time of breast cancer diagnosis are 94% more likely to experience cancer spread and 73% more likely to die over the next 10 years, compared to women with adequate Vitamin D levels. Since vitamin D deficiency is especially common in African American and obese women, this observation may partially explain the relatively poor clinical outcome experienced by these patients &lt;sup>[2]&lt;/sup>. Although current treatments for IBC are very aggressive and include surgery and radiation, IBC is still the most deadly breast cancer and has a survival rate of only 40% past 5 years. Novel treatments are desperately needed &lt;sup>[3]&lt;/sup>. Current limitations for the use of calcitriol as a treatment for IBC and non-IBC breast cancer is that high concentrations of calcitriol must be delivered to the tumor. This is even more complicated for IBC, since the tumor rapidly metastasizes and disseminates trough the lymphatic system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3X increased chance of Breast Cancer if recent vitamin D levels were low</title><link>/posts/3x-increased-chance-of-breast-cancer-if-recent-vitamin-d-levels-were-low.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/3x-increased-chance-of-breast-cancer-if-recent-vitamin-d-levels-were-low.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="serum-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-breast-cancer-in-the-military-a-case-control-study-utilizing-pre-diagnostic-serum">Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and breast cancer in the military: a case-control study utilizing pre-diagnostic serum.&lt;/h3>

These links have been investigated in human tissue homogenates and cultured cell lines. We have used non-malignant, malignant and normal reduction mammoplasty breast tissues to investigate the biological and metabolic consequences of the application of vitamin D to intact ex vivo human breast tissue. Tissues were exposed to 1α,25(OH)(2)D(3) (1,25D; active metabolite) and 25(OH)D (25D; pre-metabolite).

&lt;p>Based on preclinical studies and early clinical observations, an association between vitamin D status and breast cancer incidence and outcome has been proposed. Against this background, information on vitamin D and breast cancer was reviewed with focused attention on emerging clinical studies in this area. Prospective cohort studies do not associate 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with breast cancer incidence. While case-control studies of this question are positive, they may be confounded by reverse causality as 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels are influenced by breast cancer presence and stage. Studies of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and subsequent breast cancer recurrence provide mixed results but strongest associations were seen in analyses uncontrolled for prognostic variables, cancer therapy, BMI and physical activity. The one full-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating calcium (1000 mg elemental calcium per day) and vitamin D supplementation (400 IU D3 per day) with 36,282 participants failed to demonstrate a supplement effect on lowering breast cancer incidence. Breast cancer patients not uncommonly have vitamin D deficiency but limited control populations in available reports preclude precise prevalence estimates. As breast cancer patients are at risk for bone loss and musculoskeletal complaints from cancer or associated therapies, monitoring 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and vitamin D3 supplementation in moderate dose (1,000- 1,500 IU D3 per day) can be recommended with expectation of mainly bone benefit. In women with breast cancer, future vitamin D supplementation studies need to be appropriately designed and powered to provide definitive assessments. However, a full-scale randomized trial evaluating the influence of vitamin D supplementation on breast cancer recurrence is likely not feasible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cancer - Breast</title><link>/posts/cancer-breast.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/cancer-breast.html</guid><description>&lt;nav id="TableOfContents">&lt;/nav></description></item><item><title>Big Pharma continues to seek a patentable form of vitamin D for Breast Cancer</title><link>/posts/big-pharma-continues-to-seek-a-patentable-form-of-vitamin-d-for-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/big-pharma-continues-to-seek-a-patentable-form-of-vitamin-d-for-breast-cancer.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Postmenopausal Breast cancer 63 percent more likely if low vitamin D</title><link>/posts/postmenopausal-breast-cancer-63-percent-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/postmenopausal-breast-cancer-63-percent-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>Breast Cancer incidence change by 40 percent with vitamin D receptor genes</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-incidence-change-by-40-percent-with-vitamin-d-receptor-genes.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-incidence-change-by-40-percent-with-vitamin-d-receptor-genes.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-receptor-gene-haplotypes-and-polymorphisms-and-risk-of-breast-cancer-a-nested-casecontrol-study">Vitamin D Receptor Gene Haplotypes and Polymorphisms and Risk of Breast Cancer: A Nested Case–Control Study&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, associated with diverse biological behaviours and clinical outcome. Although some molecular subgroups of breast cancer have a targeted therapy, the most aggressive tumours still lack a molecular target. Despite Vitamin D being classically associated with the physiological role of calcium regulation and phosphate transport in bone metabolism, several studies have been demonstrating a wide range of functions for this hormone, which are particularly important in the field of cancer. The mechanisms underlying the protective actions of Vitamin D in cancer development are only sparsely understood, but evidence shows that Vitamin D participates in cell growth regulation, apoptosis and cell differentiation. In addition, Vitamin D has been implicated in the suppression of cancer cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Most of Vitamin D biological actions are mediated by the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the synthesis and catabolism of this hormone are regulated by the enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24A1. In the present review we highlight research data concerning the function of this hormone in the mammary gland, with a special focus on breast carcinogenesis. Hence, and although the available data are controversial, we considered not only updated information on epidemiology of Vitamin D in breast cancer and its potential value as a therapeutic agent or prophylactic (with an emphasis on molecular mechanisms and effectors of Vitamin D action), but we included data on its role in other stages of breast cancer progression as well. Accordingly, we review data on the influence of Vitamin D in the development of normal breast and the expression of Vitamin D-related proteins (VDR, CYP27B1 and CYP24A21) in benign mammary lesions and ductal carcinomas in situ.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>85 percent less risk of death from Breast Cancer when vitamin D levels higher than 30 ng</title><link>/posts/85-percent-less-risk-of-death-from-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-levels-higher-than-30-ng.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/85-percent-less-risk-of-death-from-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-levels-higher-than-30-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="vitamin-d-status-at-breast-cancer-diagnosis-correlation-with-tumor-characteristics-disease-outcome-and-genetic-determinants-of-vitamin-d-insufficiency">Vitamin D status at breast cancer diagnosis: correlation with tumor characteristics, disease outcome and genetic determinants of vitamin D insufficiency&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Vitamin D regulates the flow of calcium into the bloodstream and is crucial for normal bone development. Vitamin D also has a role in regulating parathyroid, neuromuscular, immune, and insulin functions. Vitamin D has been found to be associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and age-related cognitive impairment, as well as Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and esophageal, lung, pancreatic, renal, colorectal, endometrial, prostate and ovarian cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>4X less Breast Cancer if have enough vitamin D</title><link>/posts/4x-less-breast-cancer-if-have-enough-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/4x-less-breast-cancer-if-have-enough-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-deficiency-is-correlated-with-poor-outcomes-in-patients-with-luminal-type-breast-cancer">Vitamin D deficiency is correlated with poor outcomes in patients with luminal-type breast cancer.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among United States (US) women. Established risk factors explain only about 13% of breast cancer incidence among women in the US. Thus, the cause of most cases of breast cancer remains unknown. In postmenopausal women, serum calcium (Ca) and serum magnesium (Mg) play an important role in skeletal health, cell proliferation and cancer. Mg is essential for DNA duplication and repair and Mg deficiency favors DNA mutations leading to carcinogenesis. Dietary intake of Mg in the US is less than the recommended amount, and the deficit is more pronounced in older individuals where gastrointestinal and renal mechanisms for Mg conservation are not as efficient. Furthermore, healthy postmenopausal women are frequently recommended to take supplemental Ca, but not Mg and vitamin D to maintain bone and overall health. Most women with hormone sensitive breast cancer are recommended to take aromatase inhibitors, which causes bone loss and thus are generally prescribed Ca and vitamin D, but not Mg. Although the association between serum Ca and breast cancer risk remains controversial, we hypothesize that this may be because Mg levels have not been accounted for. Mg level directly influences transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) related Ca influx, calcium-adenosine triphosphatase (Ca-ATP) levels, and cell proliferation, and thereby could lead to cancer. Thus a high serum Ca/Mg ratio is more appropriate and alterations in this ratio could lead to increased development of new and recurrent breast cancer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No association found between Calcium intake and risk of breast cancer</title><link>/posts/no-association-found-between-calcium-intake-and-risk-of-breast-cancer.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-association-found-between-calcium-intake-and-risk-of-breast-cancer.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vitamin-d-and-calcium-intakes-and-breast-cancer-risk-in-pre--and-postmenopausal-women">Vitamin D and calcium intakes and breast cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women.&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Preclinical investigations and selected clinical observational studies support an association between higher vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with lower breast cancer risk. However, the recently updated report from the Institute of Medicine concluded that, for cancer and vitamin D, the evidence was &amp;lsquo;inconsistent and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements&amp;rsquo;. Against this background, reports examining vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and breast cancer incidence and outcome were reviewed. Current evidence supports the pursuit of several research questions but not routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D monitoring and vitamin D supplementation to reduce breast cancer incidence or improve breast cancer outcome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer Chemotherapy initially decreases vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-chemotherapy-initially-decreases-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-chemotherapy-initially-decreases-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>two articles on this page, both published May 2012&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

In this pilot study, we recruited 10 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who planned to initiate AI therapy; women receiving chemotherapy were excluded. Women completed two 24 h inpatient calcium absorption study visits, the first prior to AI therapy and the second at least 6 weeks following onset of AI therapy. We calculated total fractional calcium absorption (TFCA) using the dose-corrected fractional recovery of two stable isotopes from 24 h urine collections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aromatase inhibitor chemotherapy after breast cancer not associated with vitamin D levels</title><link>/posts/aromatase-inhibitor-chemotherapy-after-breast-cancer-not-associated-with-vitamin-d-levels.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/aromatase-inhibitor-chemotherapy-after-breast-cancer-not-associated-with-vitamin-d-levels.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="effect-of-baseline-serum-vitamin-d-levels-on-aromatase-inhibitors-induced-musculoskeletal-symptoms-results-from-the-ibis-ii-chemoprevention-study-using-anastrozole">Effect of baseline serum vitamin D levels on aromatase inhibitors induced musculoskeletal symptoms: results from the IBIS-II, chemoprevention study using anastrozole&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Based upon recent clinical research findings, Vitamin D is the only remaining vitamin that may have significant cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention properties. Recent large-scale prospective randomized clinical research trials have not only failed to identify a cancer prevention role (beyond a healthy balanced diet) for Vitamin E, Vitamin C, folate, and beta-carotene (a member of the Vitamin A family) supplements, but data from these trials have strongly suggested an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, at least in some sub-groups of patients, with supplements of several of these vitamins.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast Cancer 5 year study will give free vitamin D tests for 1000 women</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-5-year-study-will-give-free-vitamin-d-tests-for-1000-women.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-5-year-study-will-give-free-vitamin-d-tests-for-1000-women.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Breast Cancer Prevention Month&amp;ndash;Action!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>October is now &amp;lsquo;Breast Cancer Prevention Month&amp;rsquo; and, GrassrootsHealth is providing &lt;strong>free vitamin D tests for 1000 women 60 and older during this month&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to initiate a &lt;strong>5 year study to truly prevent breast cancer&lt;/strong> . &amp;ldquo;Fully 75% of ordinary breast cancer could be prevented&amp;rdquo; says Cedric F. Garland, Dr. P.H., the principal investigator of this study. Donations are also needed to keep the project going for its 5 year span. &lt;a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=sskbw4cab&amp;amp;et=1108099925285&amp;amp;s=11329&amp;amp;e=0019PRJ6ZyEKD34y6Ib5tiE9MzaKqL3syo0mq-6DH9T17h_Yth4cpLiW0SCecXaoR2Brhba8BS2p4nr9Km5CcN-muqylcnaD-MlSz6NTVXgu5stlj0pUukTONPxc13rI5_p_Ru7TXnLlos="> &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color:#F00;">Donate Now&lt;/span>&lt;/strong> !&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Breast cancer and Vitamin D receptors, CP27B1, and CYP24A1</title><link>/posts/breast-cancer-and-vitamin-d-receptors-cp27b1-and-cyp24a1.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/breast-cancer-and-vitamin-d-receptors-cp27b1-and-cyp24a1.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="alterations-in-vitamin-d-signalling-and-metabolic-pathways-in-breast-cancer-progression-a-study-of-vdr-cyp27b1-and-cyp24a1-expression-in-benign-and-malignant-breast-lesions">Alterations in Vitamin D signalling and metabolic pathways in breast cancer progression: a study of VDR, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 expression in benign and malignant breast lesions&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Recent studies suggest that vitamin D may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk, but most studies have evaluated only dietary vitamin D intake. The associations among ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, factors related to cutaneous vitamin D production, and breast cancer risk were evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Ontario, Canada, between 2003 and 2004 (n = 3,101 cases and n = 3,471 controls).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No reduction in Breast Cancer when vitamin D less than 40 ng</title><link>/posts/no-reduction-in-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-less-than-40-ng.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/no-reduction-in-breast-cancer-when-vitamin-d-less-than-40-ng.html</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="plasma-25-hydroxyvitamin-d-and-risk-of-breast-cancer-in-the-nurses-health-study-ii">Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of breast cancer in the Nurses&amp;rsquo; Health Study II&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Introduction&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Experimental evidence indicates vitamin D may play an important role in breast cancer etiology but epidemiologic evidence to date is inconsistent. Vitamin D comes from dietary intake and sun exposure and plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are considered the best measure of vitamin D status.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dental and breast cancer might be linked by Vitamin D</title><link>/posts/dental-and-breast-cancer-might-be-linked-by-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dental-and-breast-cancer-might-be-linked-by-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="unfortunately-no-abstact-this-side-of-a-paywall">Unfortunately no abstact this side of a paywall&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span>[25(OH)D]&lt;/span> is the major circulating form of vitamin D and a standard indicator of vitamin D status. Emerging evidence in the literature suggests a high prevalence of suboptimal vitamin D (as defined by serum 25(OH)D levels of &amp;lt;32 ng/ml) as well as an association between lower serum levels and higher mortality in cancer. We investigated the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation as a means for restoring suboptimal levels to optimal levels in cancer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
