Vitamin D supplements are often recommended to restore sufficiency, although the adherence to treatment is low. This study assessed vitamin D status at different time intervals following the cessation of treatment. The database of Clalit-Health-Services (CHS), a not-for-profit HMO covering  **more than half of the Israeli population** , was retrospectively searched for all members with available serum 25OHD test results in 2009 (245,493). We then identified those who filled any cholecalciferol prescription in 2008-2009 (121,817). 

Subjects were included in the final analysis only if they started treatment in 2009, had serum 25OHD < 50 nmol/l before the first prescription in 2009, and had at least one additional test result after the last dated prescription in 2009 (5,461). 

Serum 25OHD increased from 32 ± 11 nmol/l at baseline to 58.6 ± 22.3 nmol/l after treatment (P < 0.001).

The proportion of subjects with sufficient vitamin D after treatment increased with increasing cholecalciferol daily dose and treatment duration (P < 0.001) and decreased with increasing time from cessation of treatment (P < 0.001). 

The effect of time from treatment cessation persisted after controlling for baseline serum 25OHD, daily cholecalciferol dose, treatment duration, seasonality, gender, age, ethnicity, and BMI; the ORs for sufficient vitamin D were 2.02 (95% CI 1.66-2.45), 1.67 (1.39-2.01), and 1.23 (1.04-1.47) for >30-60, 61-99, and 100-155 days compared to >155 days, respectively. Long-term vitamin D treatment is needed to maintain sufficient levels in those with baseline serum 25OHD below 50 nmol/l.
