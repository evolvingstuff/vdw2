 **less fatigue, but little reduction is Lupus disease activity** 

 **Note: Other Lupus studies have found that the Vitamin D Receptor needs activation  
 by [VDR activators](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) or [weekly](/posts/better-than-daily) instead of daily Vitamin D** 

Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and various clinical symptoms, with vitamin D deficiency suggested as a contributing factor. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on fatigue and disease activity in SLE patients.

Methods: Patients diagnosed based on EULAR/ACR 2019 criteria were divided into three groups: no supplementation, 4000 IU, and 8000 IU of vitamin D daily  **for six months** . Clinical assessments included serum complement levels (C3 and C4), 

* fatigue scores (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy ( **FACIT** )

* Fatigue and Fatigue Severity Scale ( **FSS** ), and 

* disease activity (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index ( **SELENA-SLEDAI** ).

Results: Results showed significant increases in vitamin D levels and serum complement levels in the supplementation groups. Serum complement levels and fatigue scores improved significantly in both the 4000 IU and 8000 IU groups. Additionally, there was a slight reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI scores in the treated groups, but without statistical significance.

Conclusions: The findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation positively affects fatigue and some parameters of disease activity in SLE patients, though its overall impact on disease activity needs further investigation.
