#### Vitamin D May Not Improve Lipid Levels: A Serial Clinical Laboratory Data Study.

Circulation. 2012 Jun 20.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and associated with dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The impact is unknown of correcting vitamin D deficiency on blood lipids, strong cardiovascular disease prognostic factors.

METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lipids, we analyzed 4.06 million de-identified patient laboratory test results from September 2009 through February 2011. 

We performed a cross-sectional study of this population to determine associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lipids across clinically defined strata. We also conducted a retrospective cohort study of vitamin D deficient patients to investigate how changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels relate to changes in lipid levels. 

After exclusions,  **108,711 patients**  with serial testing were selected for cross-sectional analysis. 

Compared to vitamin D deficient patients (<20 ng/ml), those with optimal levels (?30 ng/ml) had *lower mean total cholesterol (-1.9 mg/dl [95% CI (-1.2, -2.7 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(-1.2,%20-2.7%20mg/dl)); p <.0001), 

* lower LDL cholesterol (-5.2 mg/dl [95% CI (-4.5, -5.8 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(-4.5,%20-5.8%20mg/dl)); p <.0001), 

* higher HDL cholesterol (4.8 mg/dl [95% CI (4.5, 5.0 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(4.5,%205.0%20mg/dl)); p <.0001), and 

* lower triglycerides (-7.5 mg/dl [95% CI (-6.2, -8.7 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(-6.2,%20-8.7%20mg/dl)); p <.0001). 

For the retrospective cohort analysis, raising vitamin D levels from <20 ng/ml to ?30 ng/ml (n = 6,260), compared to those remaining <20 ng/ml (n = 2,332), was associated with a mean *increase in total cholesterol (0.77 mg/dl [95% CI (0.18, 1.36 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(0.18,%201.36%20mg/dl)); p = .01) 

* and HDL cholesterol (0.42 mg/dl [95% CI (0.08, 0.76 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(0.08,%200.76%20mg/dl)); p = 0.02), but 

* non-significant changes in LDL cholesterol (0.32 mg/dl [95% CI (-0.01, 0.66 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(-0.01,%200.66%20mg/dl)); p = .06) *and triglycerides (0.04 mg/dl [95% CI (-2.16, 2.23 mg/dl)](95%%20CI%20(-2.16,%202.23%20mg/dl)); p = .97)

CONCLUSIONS:

While vitamin D deficiency is associated with an unfavorable lipid profile in cross-sectional analyses, correcting for a deficiency might not translate into clinically meaningful changes in lipid concentrations, although data from intervention trials is required to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and associated with dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The impact is unknown of correcting vitamin D deficiency on blood lipids, strong cardiovascular disease prognostic factors.

METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lipids, we analyzed 4.06 million de-identified patient laboratory test results from September 2009 through February 2011. 

We performed a cross-sectional study of this population to determine associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lipids across clinically defined strata. We also conducted a retrospective cohort study of vitamin D deficient patients to investigate how changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels relate to changes in lipid levels. 

After exclusions, __108,711 patients__ with serial testing were selected for cross-sectional analysis. 
Compared to vitamin D deficient patients (&lt;20 ng/ml), those with optimal levels (?30 ng/ml) had *lower mean total cholesterol (-1.9 mg/dl [95% CI (-1.2, -2.7 mg/dl)]; p &lt;.0001), 
*lower LDL cholesterol (-5.2 mg/dl [95% CI (-4.5, -5.8 mg/dl)]; p &lt;.0001), 
*higher HDL cholesterol (4.8 mg/dl [95% CI (4.5, 5.0 mg/dl)]; p &lt;.0001), and 
*lower triglycerides (-7.5 mg/dl [95% CI (-6.2, -8.7 mg/dl)]; p &lt;.0001). 
For the retrospective cohort analysis, raising vitamin D levels from &lt;20 ng/ml to ?30 ng/ml (n = 6,260), compared to those remaining &lt;20 ng/ml (n = 2,332), was associated with a mean *increase in total cholesterol (0.77 mg/dl [95% CI (0.18, 1.36 mg/dl)]; p = .01) 
*and HDL cholesterol (0.42 mg/dl [95% CI (0.08, 0.76 mg/dl)]; p = 0.02), but 
*non-significant changes in LDL cholesterol (0.32 mg/dl [95% CI (-0.01, 0.66 mg/dl)]; p = .06) *and triglycerides (0.04 mg/dl [95% CI (-2.16, 2.23 mg/dl)]; p = .97)
CONCLUSIONS:
While vitamin D deficiency is associated with an unfavorable lipid profile in cross-sectional analyses, correcting for a deficiency might not translate into clinically meaningful changes in lipid concentrations, although data from intervention trials is required to confirm these findings.
