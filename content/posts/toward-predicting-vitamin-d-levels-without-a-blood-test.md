#### Many models have failed to predict vitamin D levels based on about 10 variables.

 **The problems appear to be due to:** 

1. Not enough variables in the model

1. Not enough subjects

1. Not powerful enough software/model

1. Large variance between vitamin D testers ( 5% to 10%)

1. Not record other health influences - emotional stress as a child, antibiotics as a child

#### VitaminDWiki is considering solving all of the above problems

* Might be able to predect vitamin D test results to be in one of the following ranges

> 0-20 15-25 20-30 25-35 30-50  40-60  50-70 60-80 70-100 80–100+

> Goal of model: less than 5% chance of being in an adjacent category

> Goal of model: 10X less chance (0.5%) of being off by 2 categories

> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Example: predicted 20-30 ng but was actually 30-50 ng

* Vast majortiy of the data samples will be in the range of 10-30 ng

* Age range: 18 ==> 100 – majority in the range of 30-80

* Data for training and testing the model might be crowd-sourced via the web

> People could fill in both the variables AND their vitamin D test results

> Rarely can we expect that all of the variables will be filled in

> Especially expect to lack the model of the tester

#### Variables/questions

Will need to quantize the details to train a model with the data

Might want to provide the user an indication of the importance of each question.

##### Age

##### Body

Weight, BMI, Muscular (compensates for BMI in-accuracy)

<a href="/posts/skin-color" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1064">Skin color</a>

<a href="/posts/red-hair" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1677">Red hair</a> (less likely to be out in the sun)

##### Have a disease/health problem which is strongly associated with low vitamin D

[Trauma, Surgery](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/Trauma+and+surgery)

plasma exchange – reduces vitami D level by 50% in a single day

Inflammation – including depression -which consumes vitamin D

Have infection

[Gut](/categories/gut), Kidney, liver poor

Low stomach acid ==> less Magnesium

Fatty liver disease

Sore bones

No gall bladder

Poor sleep

##### Female

On the pill

Currently pregnant or lactating

Pregnancy during past 12 months

Twins during past 12 months

Excessive clothing for reliigious reasons

##### What is consumed

Vitamin D supplements : e.g. 400 IU, 4,000 IU (more than 3 months)  D2 vs D3

Take Vitamin D3 supplements with evening meal or monsaturated fats

Magnesium supplements  > 300 mg of Mg increases vitamin D levels about 30%, Mag in hard water

Probiotics

Low cholesterol diet

HFCS, pop

Omega-3

Vitamin A

Low cholesterol diet

Does not drink fortified milk

Smoking

##### Drugs increase/decrease response

statins

##### Environment/access to sun in the middle of the day

Urban/rural

Season

Latitude

Recent suncation

Outdoor worker

Work second shift

Work long hours

Altitude (30% more UV at the altitude of Colorado)

Shut-in

Air pollution – reduces UVB and likelihood that person will go outdoors

Use air conditioing  (home, work, car)

Tanning bed use

Getting sunshine thru window > 3 hours a day for – UVA decreases vitamin D levels

Note: Vitamin D is not a constant  Canadian vitamin D levels fell by 6% in 2 years (2009-2011)
