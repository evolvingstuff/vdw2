 **Abstract** 

Childhood obesity accounts for several psychosocial and clinical consequences. Psychosocial consequences include lower self-esteem, social isolation, poor academic achievement, peer problems, and depression, whereas clinical consequences are cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cancer, autoimmune diseases, girls early polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), asthma, bone deformities, etc. A growing number of studies have uncovered the association of childhood obesity and its consequences with vitamin-D (vit-D) deficiency and vitamin-D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), e.g., TaqI, BsmI, ApaI, FokI, and Cdx2. Considering the impact of vit-D deficiency and VDR gene polymorphisms, identifying associated factors and risk groups linked to lower serum vit-D levels and prevention of obesity-related syndromes in children is of utmost importance. Previously published review articles mainly focused on the association of vit-D deficiency with obesity or other non-communicable diseases in children. The nature of the correlation between vit-D deficiency and VDR gene polymorphisms with obesity in children is yet to be clarified. Therefore, this review attempts to delineate the association of obesity with these two factors by identifying the molecular mechanism of the relationship.

Background: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present on adipocytes, and many studies were performed to investigate the association between polymorphisms in VDR gene with obesity. However, in the Arab Gulf populations, whereas obesity prevalence is increasing dramatically, only a few studies were addressed this relation with obesity based only on body mass index. This study aimed to find the association between three different VDR polymorphisms BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232) and TaqI (rs731236) BsmI, with the adiposity phenotypes (BMI, body fat BF% and waist circumference (WC) as a marker of visceral obesity.

Method: In this study, 142 young female subjects from Qatar University were recruited. The study subjects were classified into 88 control subjects (BMI <24.9 kg/m2) with a mean age of 21.65 years and 54 overweight/obese subjects (BMI >25 kg/m2) with a mean age of 22.79 years. Blood samples and anthropometric measurements were evaluated. TaqMan assay was used to examine the genotyping of the three SNPs BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI using RT-PCR. In addition, vitamin D and insulin levels were measured using ELISA kits. The adiposity phenotypes were evaluated by anthropometric measurements of body weight, height, waist circumference and BF% were assessed by Body composition analyzer.

Results: The results showed that 80.3% of the study subjects were vitamin D insufficient/deficient. The main finding of the current study revealed that the carrier for the minor allele (A) in the BsmI of VDR have significantly higher BMI, WC and BF% values with p-values of 0.009, 0.015 and 0.04, respectively. In addition, it was found that increased WC is associated with lower (suboptimal) vitamin D level with an odds ratio of  **3.12**  and 95% CI of (1.01-9.63) with a p-value of 0.048.

Conclusion: The adiposity phenotype indicators including BMI, WC, and BF% were significantly associated with the minor allele (A) for BsmI (rs1544410); suggesting the possible relation of VDR polymorphism with obesity in Qatar. Vitamin D deficiency could affect the BF% in overweight and obese subjects.

To explore the mechanisms underlying the suggested role of the vitamin D/vitamin D receptor (VDR) complex in the pathogenesis of obesity we performed genetic and immunologic analyses in obese and non-obese Saudi individuals without other concomitant chronic diseases. Genomic DNA was genotyped for gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VDR by allelic discrimination in 402 obese (body mass index -BMI$30 kg/m2) and 489 non-obese (BMK30 kg/ m2) Saudis. Q-PCR analyses were performed using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System. The inflammosome pathway was analysed by PCR, cytokines and plasma lipopolysaccaride (LPS) concentrations with ELISA assays. Results showed that the VDR SNPs rs731236 (G) (TaqI) and rs1544410 (T) (Bsm-I) minor allele polymorphisms are significantly more frequent in obese individuals (p = 0.009, b = 0.086 and p = 0.028, b = 0.072, respectively). VDR haplotypes identified are positively (GTA) (p = 0.008, b =1.560);or negatively (ACC) (p = 0.044, b = 0.766) associated with obesity and higher BMI scores. The GTA "risk" haplotype was characterized by an up-regulation of inflammosome components, a higher production of proinflammatory cytokines (p<0.05) and a lower VDR expression. Plasma LPS concentration was also increased in GTA obese individuals (p<0.05), suggesting an alteration of gut permeability leading to microbial translocation. Data herein indicate that polymorphisms affecting the vitamin D/VDR axis play a role in obesity that is associated with an ongoing degree of inflammation, possibly resulting from alterations of gut permeability and microbial translocation. These results could help the definition of VDR fingerprints that predict an increased risk of developing obesity and might contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic strategies for this metabolic condition.

#### Early-onset T2 Diabetes 4.6 X more likely in obese if poor Vitamin D Receptor - Aug 2001

#### Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms are associated with obesity in type 2 diabetic subjects with early age of onset

W Z Ye, A F Reis, D Dubois-Laforgue, C Bellanne-Chantelot, J Timsit, G Velho

European Journal of Endocrinology, Vol 145, Issue 2, Aug 2001, pg 181–186, https://doi.org/10.1530/eje.0.1450181

Objective

Allelic variations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene were reported to modulate insulin secretion in response to glucose. VDR was investigated as a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Method

Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 8 (BsmI, Tru9I, ApaI) and exon 9 (TaqI) of the VDR gene were examined in 309 unrelated French subjects with T2DM and 143 controls.

Results

The distribution of alleles and genotypes of the four SNPs was similar in patients and controls. However, in patients whose age at diagnosis of diabetes was < or =45 years, homozygous subjects for the T-allele of the TaqI SNP had a higher body mass index (BMI) (31.7+/-6.7 kg/m2, P=0.0058) and an increased prevalence of obesity (81%, P=0.005) with respect to heterozygous subjects (27.9+/-5.0 kg/m2; 46%) or homozygous subjects for the t-allele (27.7+/-5.0 kg/m2; 52%). Similar Results were observed for homozygous subjects for the b-allele of the BsmI SNP. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that TT homozygosity was independently associated with obesity in these subjects (odds ratio, 4.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.64-14.76; P=0.0056).

Conclusion

VDR is not a major gene for T2DM in French Caucasians. However, polymorphisms in the VDR gene are associated with the susceptibility to obesity in subjects with early-onset T2DM. The pathophysiological mechanisms of these associations remain unexplained, but they could be related to a direct effect of vitamin D in adypocyte differentiation and metabolism, or to an indirect effect by modulation of insulin secretion.

#### The association between vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and tissue-specific insulin resistance in human obesity - Jan 2021

International Journal of Obesity volume 45, pages818–827 (2021)

A. Pramono, J. W. E. Jocken, M. E. Adriaens, M. F. Hjorth, A. Astrup, W. H. M. Saris & E. E. Blaak 

Background/objectives

To investigate (1) the association of four VDR polymorphisms (TaqI/rs731236, ApaI/rs7975232, FokI/rs10735810, and Bsml/rs1544410) with markers of adiposity and tissue-specific insulin resistance at baseline, after weight loss and weight maintenance; (2) the effect of the VDR polymorphisms in the SAT transcriptome in overweight/obese Caucasians of the DiOGenes cohort.

Methods

We included 553 adult obese individuals (mean BMI 34.8 kg/m2), men (n = 197) and women (n = 356) at baseline, following an 8-week weight loss intervention and 26 weeks weight maintenance. Genotyping was performed using an Illumina 660W-Quad SNP chip on the Illumina iScan Genotyping System. Tissue-specific IR was determined using Hepatic Insulin Resistance Index (HIRI), Muscle Insulin Sensitivity Index (MISI), and Adipose Tissue Insulin Resistance Index (Adipo-IR). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was performed to determine the effect of SNPs on SAT gene expression.

Results

None of the VDR polymorphisms were associated with HIRI or MISI. Interestingly, carriers of the G allele of VDR FokI showed higher Adipo-IR (GG + GA 7.8 ± 0.4 vs. AA 5.6 ± 0.5, P = 0.010) and higher systemic FFA (GG + GA: 637.8 ± 13.4 vs. AA: 547.9 ± 24.7 µmol/L, P = 0.011), even after adjustment with age, sex, center, and FM. However, eQTL analysis showed minor to no effect of these genotypes on the transcriptional level in SAT. Also, VDR polymorphisms were not related to changes in body weight and IR as result of dietary intervention (P > 0.05 for all parameters).

Conclusions

The VDR Fokl variant is associated with elevated circulating FFA and Adipo-IR at baseline. Nevertheless, minor to no effect of VDR SNPs on the transcriptional level in SAT, indicating that putative mechanisms of action remain to be determined. Finally, VDR SNPs did not affect dietary intervention outcome in the present cohort.

#### 1.5 to 0.3 X risk of Obesity - depends on the VDR - meta-analysis Nov 2019

 **Vitamin D Receptor Polymorphisms Associated with Susceptibility to Obesity: A Meta-Analysis** 

Med Sci Monit. 2019; 25: 8297–8305  [doi: 10.12659/MSM.915678](https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.915678)

Xi Chen,1,A,B,C,E,F Wenjing Wang,2,B,C,F Yanyan Wang,1,B,F Xiao Han,1,D and Lei Gao corresponding author3,A,E

Background

Obesity has become a global public health problem. Obesity increases the risk of several lethal diseases. This study aimed to assess whether the obesity susceptibility was associated with genetic variation in vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene by conducting a meta-analysis.

Material/Methods

PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were screened for all relevant articles published up to October 2018. The pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using STATA 13.0 software for 4 polymorphisms in the VDR gene (ApaI, BsmI, FokI and TaqI).

Results

Seven case-control studies, including 1188 obese patients and 1657 healthy controls, were recruited. The pooled findings showed that there were no associations between obesity risk and the VDR polymorphisms in ApaI, BsmI and TaqI loci overall. However, VDR TaqI polymorphism was associated with the risk of obesity in Asian under homozygous <span>[TT versus tt: odds ratio (OR)=0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.14–0.49; P<0.001]</span>, heterozygous (Tt versus tt: OR=0.34, 95% CI=0.18–0.64; P=0.001), and dominant (TT+Tt versus tt: OR=0.30, 95% CI=0.17–0.52; P<0.001) models; FokI variant was related with increased risk of obesity only under dominant model (FF+Ff versus ff: OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.15–2.06; P=0.004).

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis results suggest that the T allele of TaqI may have a protective effect, while the F allele of FokI is proposed as a risk factor related to obesity.
