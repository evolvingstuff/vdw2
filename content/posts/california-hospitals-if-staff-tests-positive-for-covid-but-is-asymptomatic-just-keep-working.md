#### [As hospitals reel, California tells coronavirus-positive medical workers to stay on the job](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-12/california-to-covid-positive-healthcare-workers-keep-working) LA times Jan 12

* "State officials are attempting to address California’s staffing shortage through a sweeping policy change that allows asymptomatic healthcare workers who have tested positive for the coronavirus to return to work immediately. The policy, set to remain in place through Feb. 1, is designed to keep many healthcare workers on the job at a time when hospitals are expecting more patients."

* "According to the guidelines, hospitals should exhaust all other options before resorting to the new policy, and workers who have tested positive for the virus should “preferably be assigned to work with COVID-19 positive patients.” The workers must always wear N95 masks."

* "“As always, when addressing any changes to our expected practices, L.A. County Department of Health Services will make adjustments that follow data-driven science and uphold our responsibility to the well-being of our staff, patients and the communities we serve,” they said."

* * This IS NOT data driven science

* "California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said similarly Monday that the  **guidelines are not a requirement**  and asked healthcare systems to use the measure only if they’ve explored all other options."

*  **Virtually everyone disagrees with this way to keep staff on the job** 

*  **Note: A  fraction of people who test positive, but are asymptomatic, are actually just presymptomatic and are very infectious**
