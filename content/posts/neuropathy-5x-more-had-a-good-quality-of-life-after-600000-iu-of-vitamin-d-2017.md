OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on neuropathy specific quality of life (NeuroQoL) in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.

METHODS: This prospective, open label study was conducted between June 2012 and April 2013. Patients with symptomatic diabetic neuropathy were given a single dose of 600,000 IU intramuscular vitamin D, and NeuroQol was assessed at baseline and at five follow-up visits every 4 weeks.

RESULTS: Of 143 participants, 41.3% were vitamin D deficient (vitamin D < 20 ng/ml). Treatment with vitamin D resulted in a significant increase in 25(OH)D (P < 0.0001) and a significant improvement in the NeuroQoL subscale score for emotional distress (P = 0.04), with no significant change in the other NeuroQoL domains of painful symptoms and paresthesia, loss of temperature and touch sensation, unsteadiness, limitation in daily activities, and interpersonal problems. There was a significant reduction in patient perception about foot problems on QoL of "quite a lot" (P < 0.05) and "very much" (P < 0.0001) with a significant reduction in the baseline response of  **having a "poor" QoL from 5.2% to 0.7%**  (P < 0.0001) and an increase in the response of an  **"excellent QoL" from 1.5% to 7.4%**  (P < 0.0001).

CONCLUSION: Vitamin D is effective in improving quality of life in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.
