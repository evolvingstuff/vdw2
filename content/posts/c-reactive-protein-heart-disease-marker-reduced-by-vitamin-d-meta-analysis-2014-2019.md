#### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on the level of circulating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials - 2014

Nutrients. 2014 Jun 10;6(6):2206-16. [doi: 10.3390/nu6062206.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu6062206.)

Vitamin D might elicit protective effects against cardiovascular disease by decreasing the level of circulating high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an inflammatory marker. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the association of vitamin D supplementation with circulating hs-CRP level. A systematic literature search was conducted in September 2013 (updated in February 2014) via PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane library to identify eligible studies. Either a fixed-effects or a random-effects model was used to calculate pooled effects. The results of the meta-analysis of 10 trials involving a total of 924 participants showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly decreased the circulating hs-CRP level by 1.08 mg/L (95% CI, -2.13, -0.03), with the evidence of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis suggested a higher reduction of 2.21 mg/L (95% CI, -3.50, -0.92) among participants with baseline hs-CRP level ≥5 mg/L. Meta-regression analysis further revealed that baseline hs-CRP level, supplemental dose of vitamin D and intervention duration together may be attributed to the heterogeneity across studies. In summary, vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for the reduction of circulating hs-CRP. However, the result should be interpreted with caution because of the evidence of heterogeneity.

#### Effect of Vitamin K Supplementation on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis - 2019

Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets. 2019;19(1):13-25. [doi: 10.2174/1871530318666180703125007.](https://doi.org/10.2174/1871530318666180703125007.)

BACKGROUND:

Multiple cross sectional and longitudinal studies reported the benefits of vitamin K intake for management of cardiometabolic risk factors so as to minimize the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

OBJECTIVE: In present systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin K supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors.

METHODOLOGY:

A systematic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane central, Clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO and Scopus databases was done from inception to November, 2017. A total of 13 trials were selected for inclusion into the present systematic review to evaluate the effect of vitamin K supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy or in population at high risk of cardiovascular diseases.

RESULTS:

Significant beneficial effects of vitamin K supplementation were found only in case of Creactive protein (p = 0.01) and insulin sensitivity index (p <0.001), while no significant effects of vitamin K supplementation were found in case of total cholesterol (p=0.857), low density lipoprotein - cholesterol (p=0.964), high density lipoprotein - cholesterol (p=0.998), interleukin - 6 (p=0.766), systolic blood pressure (p=0.660), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.818), fasting plasma glucose (p=0.362), fasting plasma insulin (p=0.928) and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (p=0.672).

CONCLUSION:

Presently available evidence are insufficient to ascertain the beneficial effects of vitamin K supplementation for the management of cardiometabolic risk factors. In order to explore the true potential of vitamin K supplementation for management of cardiometabolic diseases, large randomized placebo controlled trials are required in population with disturbed cardiometabolic profile. Present systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42018084608).

> "CRP rises within two hours of the onset of inflammation, up to 50,000-fold, and peaks at 48 hours. Its half-life of 18 hours is constant, and therefore its level is determined by the rate of production and hence the severity of the precipitating cause. CRP is thus a marker for inflammation that can be used to screen for inflammation."
