 **Short 12 week trial using 50,000 IU of vitamin D bi-weekly  
In conjuction with 2 × 1000 mg/d ω-3 fatty acid (we assume the Omega-3 was daily)  
This was a radomized controlled trial of Vit D + Omega-3 vs placebo  
Nice to see trials like this starting to use more than monotherapy  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ( e.g. just Vitamin D OR just Omega-3)  
Would expect even more benefit if trial had lasted longer - say 6 months  
Would expect even more benefit if trial had used more vitamin D  
Note: MS has been cured in > 2,000 people with daily doses ranging from 20,000 - 140,000 IU  
&nbsp; &nbsp; = approximately 140,000 - 1,960,000 IU if given bi-weekly  
&nbsp; &nbsp; = <span style="color:#00F;">3X - 39X</span> more Vitamin D than used in this study**
