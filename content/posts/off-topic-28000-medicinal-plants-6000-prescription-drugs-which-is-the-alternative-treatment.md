 **Global numbers in each case** 

 **Wonder what fraction of prescription drugs are plants or derived from plants**

#### Snips from the 8 page PDF chapter

* fewer than 16% (4,478) OF THE SPECIES USED IN PLANT-BASED MEDICINES ARE CITED IN A MEDICINAL REGULATORY PUBLICATION.

* In Europe, there is also a trend towards using traditional plant-based (‘herbal’) medicines alongside pharmaceutical drugs; in Germany, for example, it is estimated that 90% of the population use herbal medicines<sup>[2]</sup>.

* In China, for example, 10,000-11,250 species (c.34% of the native flora) have documented medicinal uses™™, but only 563 are cited in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia

* Product labelling is frequently misleading, with the trade name ‘ginseng’, for example, referring to 15 different species of plant, each with its own particular chemistry and therapeutic properties.

* For this year’s State of the World’s Plants, we carried out an analysis of the families of 28,187 species

* Will the next lead come from one or more of the 1,200 species used to treat  **malaria** 1231?

* 143 databases and publications cite 415,180 unique names for plant-based medicines- an average OF 15 ALTERNATIVE NAMES FOR 'EACH 'SPECIES"

*  **Diabetes**  affects an estimated 422 million adults and is a global health and economic burden 48. One study documents  **656 flowering plant species**  used traditionally for diabetes, representing 437 genera and 111 families<sup>[49]</sup>. 

* Of 104 plants used for  **diabetes**  in seven Central American countries, 16 showed experimental evidence that could explain their traditional use<sup>[50]</sup>. In drug discovery, Galega officinalis (goat's rue) provided a useful compound for the design of the antidiabetic drug  **Metformin** <span>[49'50]</span>, while another plant used traditionally for diabetes,  **Stevia**  rebaudiana (sweetleaf), is a source of sweetener compounds used in the food industry<sup>[51]</sup>
