Increased Vitamin D to the brain might help prevent/treat:

&nbsp; &nbsp; strokes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Epilepsy, etc.

Normally the blood-brain barrier somewaht restricts Vitamin D from getting to the brain

The nose is directly connected to the brain – no blood-brain barrier

Founder of VitaminDWiki has been inhailing Vitamin D nanoemulsion through his nose and mouth since 2017

The nose, in addition to the lung, can activate Vitamin D locally.

A nose, surprisingly, has MORE square meters of surface area than a lung
