Context: Vitamin D deficiency is common among reproductive-aged women and has a role in female reproduction. 

Objective: This study evaluated the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vit D3) in ovarian follicular development and steroidogenesis by using a human granulosa cell (GC) model. 

Design, setting and participants: 54 women who underwent IVF were enrolled. Intervention: Follicular fluid (FF), mural and cumulus GCs were collected from small (SF) and large follicles (LF). In separate experiments, primary cumulus GCs were cultured with or without vit D3 followed by RT-PCR for mRNA expression levels. The effect of recombinant anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) on nuclear localization of phospho-Smad 1/5/8 was evaluated in the presence or absence of vit D3 by using immunofluorescence. 25 hydroxy-vitamin D (25 OH-D) levels in FF as well as cell culture media AMH, progesterone (P4), and estradiol (E2) concentrations were determined by ELISA and RIA. 

Main outcome measures: 

* 1) mRNA expression levels; 

* 2) 3-βHSD enzyme activity; 

* 3) FSH-induced aromatase mRNA and E2 production, and 

* 4) nuclear localization of phospho-Smad 1/5/8. 

Results: In multivariate analysis, 25 OH-D levels in FF negatively correlated with AMH and AMHR-II mRNA levels in cumulus GCs of SF. 

Compared to women with replete 25 OH-D levels in FF, those with insufficient/deficient levels had a  **two-fold increase**  in AMHR-II mRNA levels in cumulus GCs of SF (p=0.02). 

Treatment with vit D3 caused a decrease in AMHR-II and FSHR mRNA but an increase in 3-βHSD mRNA levels compared to control (p<0.05). 

Vit D3 enhanced 3-βHSD enzyme activity as assessed by increasing P4 release; 

* however, vit D3 did not affect FSH-induced aromatase mRNA and E2 production and 

* it decreased the phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and its nuclear localization. 

Conclusion: These data suggest that vit D3 alters AMH signaling and steroidogenesis in human cumulus GCs, possibly reflecting a state of GC luteinization potentiation.

### Female fertility for IVF needs at least 30ng of Vitamin D - no mention of vitamin D level of the sperm donor

 **Vitamin D and female fertility.**

PURPOSE OF REVIEW:

Apart from the well known effects of vitamin D on maintaining calcium homeostasis and promoting bone mineralization, there is some evidence suggesting that vitamin D also modulates human reproductive processes. We will review the most interesting and relevant studies on vitamin D and female fertility published over the past year.

RECENT FINDINGS:

In the past year, several observational studies reported a better in-vitro fertilization outcome in women with sufficient vitamin D levels (≥30 ng/ml), which was mainly attributed to vitamin D effects on the endometrium. One randomized controlled trial found an increased endometrial thickness in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) receiving vitamin D during intrauterine insemination cycles. Further, vitamin D supplementation had a beneficial effect on serum lipids in PCOS women. Vitamin D treatment improved endometriosis in a rat model and increased vitamin D intake was related to a decreased risk of incident endometriosis. Vitamin D was also favorably associated with primary dysmenorrhea, uterine leiomyoma, and ovarian reserve in late reproductive aged women.

SUMMARY:

In women undergoing  **in-vitro fertilization, a sufficient vitamin D level (≥30 ng/ml) should be obtained.** 

Vitamin D supplementation might improve metabolic parameters in women with PCOS. 

A high vitamin D intake might be protective against endometriosis.
