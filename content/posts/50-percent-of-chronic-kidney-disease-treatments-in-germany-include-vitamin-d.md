Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is gaining increasing medical and economical importance, but little information exists about treatment variation and the impact of routine clinical treatments on survival, quality of life, and cost. We demonstrate the first results of a national electronic registry of nephrology clinic data that will serve as a resource for the prospective observation of CKD patients in Germany. A large network of German nephrologist practices is currently joining the project. Routinely obtained clinical data for non-dialysis dependent CKD patients are documented in health records electronically, and elements from these data are extracted using QuaNT (Qualitätssicherung Nephrologie und Transplantation) to create a centralized database. Here, we report cross-sectional data from 59 participating nephrology clinics and 6,187 patients with CKD Stage 3 - 5 in 2011. Mean age ± standard deviation (SD) was 72 ± 12 years. The distribution of CKD 3, 4, and 5 (non-dialysis) was 60%, 33%, and 8%, respectively. The major renal diseases were hypertension/vascular nephropathy (47%) and diabetic nephropathy (26%). 

* Reninangiotensin-system inhibitor prescription was 78%. 

* Vitamin D prescription was 50%, 

* phosphate binders 6%, 

* (iron (oral or i.v.) 19%, and 

* erythropoietin-stimulating agents 14%. 

This electronic registry follows clinical nephrology care and outcomes for CKD patients in Germany, and increased participation is anticipated. As a component of the initiative, variation in patient care will be studied to identify best treatment practices in analyses integrated into the international CKD Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (CKDopps).
