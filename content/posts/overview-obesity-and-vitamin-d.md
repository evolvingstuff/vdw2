 **Black line = US BMI increase** 

From 1980 to 2008, the average BMI for men rose in all but eight countries; the average for women rose in all but 19. Globally, nearly 10 percent of men and nearly 14 percent of women are obese, meaning their BMI is 30 or more. In some countries, particularly in the Pacific Islands, obese is average. Countries with a high average BMI tend to have high rates of diabetes, and vice versa.

#### [BMI - what is wrong with it](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/a-number-that-may-not-add-up/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0) NY Times - April 2014

Invented in early 1800's 

Never meant to be a measure for individuals

Currently  18.5 = underweight; 18.5 and 24.9 = normal; 25 to 29.9 = overweight; >30 = obese. 

Grade 1 =30 - 34.9; Grade 2= 35 - 39.9; Grade 3 > 40

At best, though, B.M.I. is a crude measure that actually misses more than half of people with excess body fat,

It measures total body weight, not just fat. When Arnold Schwarzenegger was Mr. Universe, his B.M.I. was well in the obese range

Article mentions, and appears use the contents of a new book [The Obesity Paradox: When Thinner Means Sicker and Heavier Means Healthier](http://www.amazon.com/Obesity-Paradox-thinner-heavier-healthier-ebook/dp/B00FFFN7N2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397475378&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Obesity+Paradox%2C) Amazon March 2014
