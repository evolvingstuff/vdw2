Initial evidence indicates that preoperatively initiated administration of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) attenuates the postoperative inflammatory reaction. The effects of immunonutrition containing omega-3 FAs, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on the inflammatory response to abdominal surgery continues to be unclear, although improved outcomes have been reported. Therefore, we determined the effectiveness of preoperatively initiated omega-3 FAs administration on postoperative inflammation defined as CRP (C-Reactive Protein), IL-6 (Interleukin 6), and WBC (White Blood Count) and potential effects on postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) due to an improved inflammatory response. 

Methods: a literature search of Cochrane Library was conducted to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of preoperatively initiated omega-3 to standard care, placebo, or other immunonutrients excluding omega-3 FAs in patients undergoing abdominal surgery until the end of December 2022. 

Results: a total of 296 articles were found during the initial search. Thirteen RCTs involving 950 patients were identified that met the search criteria. These were successively analyzed and included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between the groups with respect to inflammatory markers IL-6: −0.55 <span>[−1.22; 0.12]</span> p = 0.10, CRP: −0.14 <span>[−0.67; 0.40]</span> p = 0.55, WBC: −0.58 <span>[−3.05; 1.89]</span> p = 0.42, or hospital stay −0.5 <span>[−1.43; 0.41]</span> p = 0.2. 

Conclusion: although reduced inflammatory markers were observed, preoperative administration of omega-3 FAs immunonutrients had no significant effect on the postoperative inflammatory response in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. Yet, results obtained from this study are inconclusive, likely attributed to the limited number of trials and patients included. Further studies are required to obtain a better educated verdict.

##### The mistake of trying to find a benefit from small doses for a short time is often a problem for Omega-3, Vitamin D, Magnesium, etc.

##### Probably need 1 gram/day pf Omega-3 for months, with fatty meal, AND Omega-6 intake MUST be reduced
