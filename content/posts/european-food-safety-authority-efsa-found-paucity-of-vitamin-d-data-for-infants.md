* “200 nanomols per litre (nmol/L) of the major circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was “unlikely to pose a risk of adverse health outcomes in healthy infants.”

   * 80 ng is OK

* “Conclusion reached on these updated ULs identifed that up to 6 months, the available body of evidence supported keeping the previous UL of 25 micrograms per day (µg/day)”

   * 1000 IU = upper limit if <6 months old
