*  **As a traveler to an area which has Zika** 

*  **If you live in an area which is visited by Zika** 

 **In both situations you want to strengthen your immune system** 

* A easy way to strengthen your immune system is to increase the  **vitamin D**  levels in your body

* For most people that can be done quite quickly -within a week – by taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D daily for a week. The immune system will remain strong for about 2 months, plenty enough time to visit an area with mosquitos carrying various diseases, such as Zika.

* If you do not need protection until two months in the future you could just take 5,000 IU of vitamin D daily. 

* If you are visiting a mosquito area, mosquito repellants and killers work well, for a few weeks.

* But mosquito repellents and killers  should not be used on a long term basis, as they often cause health problems. Eliminating potential places of standing water around your house provides long-term protection. The Zika mosquito rarely goes more than 300 feet from the place it was born.  You could also eliminate potential standing water near our school, the place where you work, etc.

* &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Note:**  Mosquito netting does not help as the Zika mosquito does not bite at night

* &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Note:**  Most mosquitos lay their eggs in standing water. 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; The Zika mosquito however, can lay eggs in a small, dry, depression 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; and the eggs will hatch when water accumulates as much as a year later.

### Important notes

1. Zika virus is transmitted by sex as well as mosquito [NYT Feb 2, 2016](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/health/zika-sex-transmission-texas.html?_r=0)

> Thus it is probably unsafe for a man who has been in tropical Americas to have sex for - weeks? months?

> Unknown: Does the man have to have had symptoms to become infectious?

> [dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile are not sexually transmissible](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/the-past-present-and-future-of-zika/459585/%20)

1. Zika eggs laid on vehicles (trucks, cars, boats, airplanes) can travel 1,000's of miles before getting instant mosquitos after a rain

> Zika eggs can lie dormant for over a year before being hatched by water

> Wonder how long it will be until countries start fumigating vehicles and contents passing thru customs.

> Person who was interviewed wrote a book "Prevention of Bug Bites, Stings, and Disease" in 2009 (on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/019536578X?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage)

> &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Excellent book!!** 

> "DEET is shorthand for the chemical name N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide

> " **Picaridin**  is a little more effective than DEET and seems to keep mosquitoes at a greater distance," he says. When people use DEET, mosquitoes may land on them but not bite. When they use a product containing picaridin, mosquitoes are less likely to even land. Repellents with IR 3535 are slightly less effective, Strickman says, but they don't have the strong smell of other products.

> "To avoid irritating the eyes, put the repellent on hands and rub it on the face."

> " tucking pants into socks or shoes helps keep mosquitoes from getting inside clothing."

> These eggs are adapted to withstand dry conditions until there are floods and they can hatch.  

> The pattern of egg lying depends on the specific type of Mosquito. 

> Most mosquitoes stay close to where they were hatched so they can raise another brood. 

> Some mosquito species only have one generation each year. Others can have four or more!

### Recommendation: Use mosquito repellent every 4-6 hours to deter mosquito landing   
&nbsp; &nbsp; & Vitamin D  to improve immune systems if a mosquito does bite

A [loading dose of 400,000 IU of vitamin D](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need) (generally taken over a week) will strengthen immune system for ~ 3 months

A loading dose does not require a prescription and costs as little as $2

For most adults 400,000 IU will be enough to

* improve immune systems ability to fight off many diseases, not just Zika

> ~Hs~&nbsp; immune system of mother as well as immune system of the placenta

* typically make people feel much healthier for months

### Mosquito traps will reduce the number of mosquitoes in a yard (but not all of them)

* Many companies use one or more attractants such as Carbon Dioxide, Lurex and Octenol

* [Mosquitoworld](http://www.mosquitoworld.net/mosquito-control/trap-reviews/) &nbsp;[http://propanemosquitotrap.com/](http://propanemosquitotrap.com/) &nbsp; [http://www.mosquitoreviews.com](http://www.mosquitoreviews.com) &nbsp; [http://www.mosquitotraps.com/](http://www.mosquitotraps.com/)

* One review found models trapping hundreds to as many as 4,000 mosquitos in three hours

### Bacteria-Laden Mosquitoes may be a low-cost way to stop both Dengue and Zika virus

[Technology Review Feb 26](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600893/bacteria-laden-mosquitoes-may-be-the-cheapest-way-to-stop-dengue-and-zika/)

Gates Foundation, using bacteria natural to half of all insects, cost of $5/person and perhaps as low as $1/person - with no annual update cost

Has already been tested in Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Rio de Janeiro to stop Dengue

No data just yet as to effectiveness.

__VitaminDWiki comment - while there can be problems with this method, fumigating entire countries is probably worse **### The Mosquito is the deadliest animal

### Mosquitoes actually have 6 needles, not just one

[3 minute Video](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/mosquitoes-drill-under-human-skin-with-six-hollow-needles/) Scientific American June 2016

1 saws the skin, 3 widen the hole, 1 pumps the blood, 1 de-clotts the blood (and creates itching and provides virus)

Also - the needles "sniffs out" and bends to the blood

### Other deadly viruses carried by the same mosquito

* [Mosquito control: can it stop Zika at source?](http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/articles/mosquito-control/en/) WHO Feb 17

> "Compared with the situation 50 years ago, the worldwide incidence of dengue has risen** 30-fold__"

> VitaminDWiki wonders how much of that 30X increase is due to lowered levels of vitamin D in the same time period''
