* Original source of "Black Death" was bacteria of fleas on marmots

* “It is, perhaps, no coincidence that, in the past two decades, China has been the origin of **SARS, the swine flu, and now the Covid-19**  coronavirus. Nor should we be surprised that Iran and Italy have emerged, once more, as waypoints for pandemic spread”

 **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#Origins%20)** 

* “Some historians believe the innumerable deaths brought on by the plague cooled the climate by freeing up land and triggering reforestation. This may have led to the Little Ice Age”

* Wikipedia does not identify the source of Black Death
