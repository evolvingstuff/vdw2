One of the more interesting properties is that it penetrates biological membranes very quickly, and it could carry with it a wide variety of molecules, most of which had very limited ability to penetrate those membranes on their own.</p><p>I became familiar with DMSO by reading excerpts from a legendary book titled Devil&rsquo;s Diary.2 This book was a manual for mayhem produced by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the 1950s. The presumptions of the book were that the CIA agent could be dropped into a foreign country with no backup and very few resources. The book covered the use of plant/animal poisons and other disruptive chemicals that could be mostly made from nature.</p><p>In the Devil&rsquo;s Diary, DMSO was mixed with boomslang (a sub-saharan snake) venom.3 This mixture was then put into what may have been the world’s first felt-tipped pen. The felt-tipped pen was then intended to be “accidentally” rubbed up against the exposed skin of the assassination target. The DMSO would carry the venom through the skin and into the blood stream. Because the boomslang venom has a delayed reaction, the assassin can be long gone before the victim even suspects that anything is wrong.</p><p>Molecule size is a limiting factor for absorption into the human body through the skin. DMSO appears to dramatically change the limitations of this absorption. For example, insulin - a very large molecule (about 5800 Daltons) is poorly absorbed even with DMSO, but snake venom tends to be a composite of different molecules, many of which are much smaller than insulin. Ascorbic acid is a relatively small molecule (C6H8O6) that is poorly absorbed transdermally.</p><p>Vitamin C is actually not a specific molecule, but is the generic term for all those molecules that can release ascorbic acid into our bodies. Pure ascorbic acid sometimes creates stomach upset in people who do not tolerate much acid in the stomach. For this reason, the most common forms of vitamin C found as supplements are mineral ascorbates. These are pH neutralized forms of vitamin C that will be gentler on the stomach. It is possible to get vitamin C as a pure ascorbic acid but you have to read the labels to be sure.</p><p>Acids melt metal. This is just basic chemistry. Try and find a lab that keeps its hydrochloric acid in a stainless steel container. What most of the non-chemists in the world are unaware of is that common minerals such as calcium and magnesium, are also metals. Acids, therefore are a good candidate to melt calcium deposits, and ascorbic acid is an acid that might be able to accomplish this task.</p><p><strong>Now, I want to present two painful stories.</strong></p><p>About four years ago, I started to develop vague pains in my <strong>right thigh</strong> just below the greater trochanter. I tend to have tightness in my leg muscles, and I assumed that these pains were nothing more. The pains got worse, and I would periodically try to stretch them out, with some success. Finally, one afternoon the pain got dramatically worse. I tried everything that I could think of with no result. I was in relatively little pain as long as I didn’t move. I could even limp around the house with minimal pain as long as I proceeded slowly. However, some movements/positions were almost impossible and very painful. I could not lay down in my bed or go to sleep without very significant pain. As I would later discover, trying to get into the passenger seat of my car was a truly horrible experience.</p><p>I was up all night, and the pain continued. I made an appointment with a chiropractor who had in the past fixed what I could not fix myself. After working on me for almost two hours, and finally giving up, I asked him what else it could be. He rattled off a couple of possibilities, but when he said “calcium deposit,” I immediately made the possible connection to an exercise that routinely put me on my right side on a hard floor - putting significant pressure on the exact location that was the source of the pain. If you have ever seen surfer’s knees, you know that repetitive pressure on a specific location can eventually result in “protective” calcium deposits.</p><p>I had an X-ray done, and it <strong>confirmed that the pain was from a calcium deposit</strong> . In this case, it looked like a cloudy area on the X-ray. It was a large collection of very small calcium deposits.</p><p>I left the medical center with a description of the problem but without any recommendation as to how to fix the problem. I had a prescription for pain pills, which I didn’t bother to fill. On the way home, I was desperately trying to figure out how to deal with the calcium deposit. When I got home, I looked for and found a bottle of pure ascorbic acid powder. I asked my wife to get me a bottle of DMSO from a local health-food store. I had never heard of using DMSO/ ascorbic acid to melt calcium deposits beneath the skin but I was willing to try anything that didn’t seem terribly dangerous.</p><p>While she returned, I mixed some of the pure ascorbic acid with enough DMSO to turn the mixture into a <strong>thin paste</strong> . I rubbed it on the skin at the location of the calcium deposit. In the next couple of hours, I repeated this three more times.</p><p>By the next morning, the pain was almost gone. I applied the ascorbic acid/ DMSO one more time in the morning. By that afternoon, I remember going out to the hay storage area, and carrying a bale of hay to the goat pen without pain or difficulty.</p><p><strong>Now comes my wife’s story.</strong></p><p>Karen broke her <strong>tailbone</strong> twice before she was 20 years old. By the age of 35, she had developed terrible back and hip pain. X-rays finally confirmed a diagnosis of spinal stenosis due to calcium deposits. She was very prone to any inflammation in that area of her spine because it would lead to more irritation, and more inflammation.</p><p>I finally suggested that we try the ascorbic acid/DMSO treatment on her low back area, and Karen agreed.</p><p>Karen’s treatment took considerably longer than my own because <strong>my calcium deposits were diffuse, and hers were solid</strong> . Over a period of about 6 months, I applied the ascorbic acid/DMSO treatment to the painful areas of her lower back about 10 times. After that, she said that she still had some hip pain, but that the pain was reduced by about 80% both in intensity and in frequency of occurrence.</p><p>Karen’s calcium deposits tend to reappear, and I have occasionally had to do one or two additional treatments, always with the same success.</p><p><strong>Some Hints for Using DMSO</strong></p><p>I don’t claim to be an expert on the solvent properties of DMSO but I thought it would be useful to at least mention the precautions that I take when using DMSO on the skin.</p><p>Because DMSO can carry a lot of chemicals right through the skin, cleanliness is a top priority. It would not make sense to come in from applying chemical herbicides to your garden, and proceed directly to using DMSO on your body.</p><p>Mix the DMSO and ascorbic acid only in glass, because glass will not leach into solvents. Metal containers will leach excessively because of the ascorbic acid (even stainless steel), and ceramic containers may be contaminated with lead. Plastic containers could possibly leach because of the DMSO solvent.</p><p>Cleaning the glass container is important. I like to use the bottom of a water glass, especially if it is slightly concave. The volume of the mixture is small, and cleaning just the exposed surface of the bottom of the glass is much easier. I do not use dish detergent or soap. These are contaminants. I clean the bottom of the glass ONLY with water, and wipe it down only with a clean cotton cloth.</p><p>I will mix and apply the ascorbic acid/DMSO paste only with my fingers. Because I know that I can safely absorb the paste, I deem my fingers to be a safe method to mix and apply it, as long as they are clean. Once, again, soap and detergent are contaminants. I wash my hands very thoroughly and ONLY with water. I dry with a clean cotton cloth.</p><p><strong>Some Hints for Using Ascorbic Acid to &ldquo;Melt&rdquo; Calcium Deposits.</strong></p><p>It is probable that a wide variety of acids could be used with DMSO to melt calcium deposits. I chose ascorbic acid because I know that it is not just safe, but also generally very beneficial.</p><p>Acids such as I describe in this article can melt calcium deposits, but they can also melt away the mineral content in bones. The calcium deposits will melt much quicker because they are poorly constructed, do not have a collagen matrix, and do not easily regenerate themselves like living bones. Still, especially in areas where bones are small and fragile (such as the lower end of the spine), I would caution against applying the ascorbic acid/DMSO treatment too frequently. I always let a couple weeks pass between treatments so that bone remodeling can occur before applying the mixture again.</p><p><strong>Daniel Cobb, DOM Doctor of Oriental Medicine 41 Camino Largo Santa Fe, NM 87507</strong></p><p><a href=mailto:danielcobb2@yahoo.com>danielcobb2@yahoo.com</a></p><p><a href=http://www.danielcobbdom.com/>http://www.danielcobbdom.com/</a> He tells about the treatment in an audio file</p><p>He also takes 4,000 IU of vitamin D in the Winter</p><hr><ul><li><a href=https://remedygrove.com/remedies/Melting-Calcium-Deposits-like-a-Boss>Melting Calcium Deposits Like a Boss</a> June 2017</li></ul><blockquote><p>Used Vinegar and DMSO to disolve 20 year-old Calcium deposits in elbow - could not bend further than 90 degrees</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://www.terrytalksnutrition.com/terrys-blog/bone-spurs-are-not-bone/>BONE SPURS ARE NOT BONE</a> Terry Talks Nutrition</li></ul><blockquote><p>&ldquo;It’s like debris collecting in a river or stream impeding the flow of water.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The solution to this biochemical malfunction is to <strong>increase the acidity temporarily.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This can be done with apple cider vinegar which is not the best solution since it’s a very mild acidity at only 5%.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A remedy that has been used for many years is the combination of</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>    calcium chloride, calcium phosphate, magnesium glycerol phosphate, ammonium chloride and betaine hydrochloride.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Adding <strong>vitamin C</strong> and P-5-P to this combination would make a very powerful formula for dissolving bone spurs such as what is commonly known as heel spurs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the following PDF :&ldquo;Vitamin B6 as P-5-P: The P-5-P (pyridoxal-5-phosphate) form of vitamin B6 is readily absorbed by the body and doesn’t need to be converted by the liver&rdquo; <i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/preventing-and-healing-bone-spurs-naturally.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=https://boingboing.net/2019/04/16/hanging-by-my-arms-helps-my-sh.html>Hanging by my arms helps my shoulder pain</a> April 2019</li></ul><blockquote><p>Shoulder pain in dominate hand shoulder.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Palms flat and outward while hanging, pain gradulally went away in weeks,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pain returned when forgot to hang for a few weeks</p></blockquote></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>dosage</span>
