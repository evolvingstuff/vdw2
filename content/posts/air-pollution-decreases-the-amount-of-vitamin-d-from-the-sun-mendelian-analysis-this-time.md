#### Impact of particulate-matter air pollution on 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: a mendelian randomisation study

Public Health. 2024 May:230:190-197. [doi: 10.1016/j.puhe.2024.03.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2024.03.002)

Objectives: In observational studies, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level in body has been found to be closely related to particulate matter (PM) air pollution. In this study, we used the two-sample mendelian randomisation (MR) method to investigate and discuss the potential causal relationship and mode of influence.

Study design: MR study.

Methods: PM data (PM10, PM2.5-10, PM2.5, PM2.5 absorbance) came from the UK Biobank database, and 25(OH)D data came from European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) database. The analysis was conducted utilising three prominent methods (inverse-variance-weighted <span>[IVW]</span>, MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode). The primary emphasis was placed on IVW, accompanied by heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy tests. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was undertaken.

Results: The MR analysis revealed a significant association between exposure to PM10 and a decrease in levels of 25(OH)D (odds ratio <span>[OR]</span>: 0.878, 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>: 0.789-0.977). However, no significant relationship was observed between PM2.5 exposure and 25(OH)D (OR: 0.943, 95%CI: 0.858-1.037). Further analysis indicated that the main contributor to the decline in 25(OH)D levels is linked to PM2.5-10 exposure (OR: 0.840, 95%CI: 0.751-0.940) and PM2.5 absorbance (OR: 0.875, 95%CI: 0.824-0.929). No heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy existed.

Conclusions: The MR results suggest that PM (PM10, PM2.5-10 and PM2.5 absorbance) exposure lowers vitamin D (VD) levels, but PM2.5 was not found to have a significant effect on VD in humans.
