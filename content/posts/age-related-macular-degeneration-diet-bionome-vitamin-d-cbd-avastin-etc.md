**Observations while under contruction as of March 2019** 

1. AMD greatly increased recently

> &nbsp; &nbsp; perhaps due to poor nutrition

1. AMD greatly increased with smoking since the 1930's perhaps due to tobacco additives

1. AMD is more likely if have some genes 

> &nbsp; &nbsp; but genes are much less of a risk factor than nutrition or smoking

1. Avastin ( a chemo drug) injections appear to nicely slowdown wet AMD progression

1. CBD treats both wet and dry AMD

> &nbsp; &nbsp; sublingual CBD works, Big Pharma has also patented CBD eye drops

1. Vitamin D treats and prevents both wet and dry AMD

> &nbsp; &nbsp; generally using oral Vitamin D

1. Omega-3 treats wet AMD

 **Suggestions to prevent AMD** 

Eat organic food (more nutrition), supplement with Vitamin D, Omega-3, do not smoke

 **Additional suggestions to treat AMD** 

Get Avastin injections, Add CBD

#### AMD is due to poor diet (CURE AMD Foundation)

 **Dr. Chris Knobbe believes that an ancestral diet would prevent AMD  
But it is virtually impossible to get a nutritionally complete ancestral diet in 2019   
Modern day "Ancestral" food lack Magnesium, Vitamin D, Zinc, Vitamin K, Omega-3, etc.**

 **[What Are the Best ‘Eye Vitamins’ for Macular Degeneration?](https://www.cureamd.org/best-eye-vitamins-macular-degeneration/) - none** 

* " macular degeneration was an extraordinary medical rarity, from 1851 until about 1930."

* " **Cochrane’s**  final conclusion reads as follows: “There is accumulating evidence that taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidants supplements, such as vitamin C, lutein, zeaxanthin, or any of the commonly marketed multivitamin combinations.” 

* [Annals of Internal Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159382) in Nov 2017 commented on the Cochrane report

>  **Antioxident vitamin or mineral supplements do not prevent age-related macular degeneration** 

* "For those with category 3 or 4 macular disease, at 5 years from the onset of the study, 

> the probability of progression to advanced AMD was 

> 28% for those given placebo, 

> 23% for those given antioxidants (vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene), 

> 22% for those given zinc, and 

> 20% for those given antioxidants and zinc (the AREDS formula)"

* "And from this we get the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), which is also 13"

#### Genetic testing for AREDS  - nope

 **AREDS<span style="color:#00F;">slowed AMD progression by 3X</span> for ~30% of people, but <span style="color:#F00;">50% faster progression </span>for 30% of people**

* "If one has two copies of the CFH Y402H allele, they would develop wet AMD 2.8 years sooner, on average, compared to those who have no copies of the gene.<sup>[63]</sup> For those who have two copies of the ARMS2 A69S gene, they develop wet AMD 5.2 years sooner than an individual with no copies of the gene, again, on average"

* "...in May of 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) gave conditional approval for reimbursement of so-called pharmacogenetic testing for patients who have AMD"  There is a CPT code

*  **57X increase in AMD in Japan in 30 years** 

* "...as compared to the Ancestral Diet, the relative risk of developing AMD with the SAD diet is 74-fold greater."

#### AMD and Gut Bionome

* [The Microbiome and Age-related Macular Degeneration](https://www.brightfocus.org/macular/article/microbiome-and-age-related-macular)

> Video with transcript

> "...my research suggests that modifying our diets to have a lower glycemic index, or a healthier dietary pattern, may have a dramatic effect on reducing AMD in populations. A six-unit change in dietary glycemic index, (ie, the equivalent of eating 5 pieces of whole-wheat bread instead of white bread) would save 100,000 people from developing AMD over 5 years."

#### CBD appears to treat AMD (via VEGF, etc)

*  **[Studies](https://www.sativaisticated.com/medical-cannabis/research/cannabis-research-for-age-related-macular-degeneration/) as of March 2019** 

* [ **One person took CBD**  for a tic problem and her AMD decreased](https://unitedpatientsgroup.com/blog/2016/10/30/cannabis-macular-degeneration)

> Earlier she had stopped her AMD injections earlier

> Doctor said of her wet AMD "“The leaking in the blood vessel that causes lesions, bumps, swelling, etc. (which causes the loss of vision) was mostly gone.”

> "There are cannabinoid receptors in the eye area"

> "But cannabidiol has also been shown to be an anti-inflammatory specifically for the retina area"

* [Cannabidiol (CBD) And Age-Related Macular Degeneration](https://www.therajoypharma.com/cannabidiol-cbd/cannabidiol-cbd-and-age-related-macular-degeneration/) Oct 2018  **both wet and dry** 

> CBD is an anti-inflammatory for the retinal area

> CBD is neuroprotective

> CBD is anti-angiogenesis

> CBD has anti-aging properties

> CBD inhibits  **VEGF**  growth (vascular endothelial growth factor), the growth of new blood vessels

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Same target as Avastin injections

> CBD lowers blood pressure

> CBD protects retina cells

> CBD reduces ocular pressure

> "The ECS ( endocannabinoid system) has two different types of receptors — CB1 and CB2. While CB2 receptors occur throughout the peripheral nervous system and the immune system, CB1 receptors primarily cluster in the brain and spinal cord. When you consume cannabis, it enters the bloodstream and binds to either CB1 or CB2 receptors."

> " CBD mainly binds to CB2 receptors"

> "In a 2004 study of brain tumors, researchers found that cannabinoids blocked and inhibited VEGF pathways through the body, showing incredible promise for cannabis as a treatment for macular degeneration. THC seems to be especially effective at targeting VEGF progression

#### Avastin Injections slow wet AMD

* [What Is Avastin (Bevacizumab)?](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/avastin) Everyday Health

> Develped for various Cancers FDA approved for Colon Cancer in 2004, Off-label use for AMD

> has a very long list of side effects

> "A recently published extension of the CATT study showed that, after five years, 

> 50 % of patients receiving anti-VEGF injections had 20/40 vision or better in the treated eye; 

> 20 % had 20/200 or worse; 

> 30 % had vision somewhere between these two figures. 

> Many patients did not require injections every month after the initial 2-year study period.
