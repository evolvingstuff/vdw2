#### Observational Retrospective Bombshell: Elderly Infected with COVID-19 at High Risk for Developing Alzheimer’s Disease

 **[TriaSiteNews reporting on a study in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease ](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/observational-retrospective-bombshell-elderly-infected-with-covid-19-at-high-risk-for-developing-alzheimers-disease-387aa3ce)** 

* "The study authors report a striking, and disturbing reality: those individuals 65-year-old and up that were afflicted with COVID-19 have nearly double the risk (0.35% to 0.68%)) for developing the neurodegenerative disease within a year of the infection."

* "...study involving a total of **6,245,282**  adults who were 65-years old and up with no previous Alzheimer’s diagnosis and no visits documented in the electronic health record."

* For seniors >85 HR =  1.82 <span>[95% CI, 1.69 to 1.97]</span>

#### Study should have had a many-month gap between COVID and counting Alz (a disease that is slow to develop)

#### VitaminDWiki anticipates 3X increased Alz risk due to COVID in 3 years

#### Might not be cause==> effect. (3 possibilities as of Sept 17, 2022)

1.  **Just being in the hospital (perhaps ICU) might increase risk of seniors getting Alzheimers** 

> Study does not appear to mention if the people were admitted to a hospital

1.  **Perhaps COVID infection caused seniors to be more sensitive to Alzheimer's symptoms** 

1.  **Perhaps those not getting COVID did not get checkups as much, so were less likely to get noticed with Alzheimer/s symptoms**
