It is virtually impossble to get >100 ng level of vitamin D without supplementation.

Strongly suspect that the critically ill people had heard that vitamin D might help.

Note 1: Several <span>[Vitamin D sachets in India – fewer than a third had the stated amount – Nov 2013]</span> (60,000 IU = standard size in India) &nbsp; can result in blood readings > 100 ng for several days.

Note 2: Some people who die with high levels of vitamin D also have recently gone to sunny climates to "cure" a disease

We studied the association between admission serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 level and in-hospital mortality in a prospective cohort of critically ill patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care referral center. Of the 180 patients enrolled, 129 were included. Vitamin D3 deficiency was observed in 37 % (n = 48) and  **supra-physiological levels (≥250 nmol/L) in 15.5 %**  (n = 20). Patients with supraphysiological vitamin D3 levels were grouped as outliers. There was no difference in mortality (p = 0.41) between vitamin D3 deficient (21/48) and non-deficient (36/81) patients in analysis with and without outliers. Patients with vitamin D3 ≥250 nmol/L had a significantly higher (p = 0.02) Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and mortality (p = 0.003) [mean (SD) 60.1 ± 17.1 and 75 % (15/20), respectively](mean%20(SD)%2060.1%20±%2017.1%20and%2075%20%%20(15/20),%20respectively) when compared with the rest [45.6 ± 18 and 38.5 % (42/109), respectively](45.6%20±%2018%20and%2038.5%20%%20(42/109),%20respectively). The sensitivity, specificity and SAPS II independent odds ratio to predict mortality in patients with supraphysiological vitamin D3 levels were 26.3, 93.1 and 3.7 % (95 % confidence interval 1.2–11.4; p = 0.03), respectively. In conclusion, vitamin D3 deficiency in our cohort was not associated with mortality. 

A patient subset with supra-physiological vitamin D levels had higher illness severity scores and mortality. Extrinsic factors interfering with test results were ruled out. A biological hypothesis to explain this observation is proposed. Further clarification of mechanisms leading to this observation is warranted.
