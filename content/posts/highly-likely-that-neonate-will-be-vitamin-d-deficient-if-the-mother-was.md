Background: high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency has been observed in pregnant Indian women and their newborns, variation in the prevalence of Vitamin D during pregnancy has been observed from various parts of India which may be due to differences in the ethnicity, food habits, and geographical location. Maternal vitamin D deficiency has been shown to negatively impact the fetus, increasing the risks of intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth. These conditions can significantly affect newborn health and development.

Aim & Objective: To find out the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in newborns and Correlation of maternal and neonatal vitamin d levels.

Methods: The present study is a cross-sectional observational study conducted from July 2023 to September 2023 in the Perinatology section of Department of Pediatrics, at a tertiary care hospital of Jammu city. After selecting pregnant women of age 20 to 35 years with singleton term pregnancy, written informed consent was taken during antennal period and blood sample for vitamin D level was collected along with their routine lab investigations and was sent for estimating vitamin D levels. The samples of the new born were taken from cord blood and then were sent for vitamin D level. Results: There was a positive correlation between the Vitamin D levels of the mother and the neonates at birth. 97.1% of the newborns born to the mothers with deficient levels of vitamin D had deficient vitamin D levels (p-value 0.02)

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent in our region with 81.3% neonates having VDD. Vitamin D deficiency in the mothers is also widely prevalent. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent among the early terms as compared to the full terms. Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in the small for gestational age infants as compared to the appropriate for gestational age infants.

Relevance: Since there is a paucity of data in our setup and also because of long term complication of vitamin D deficiencies in neonates we decided to perform a study to evaluate the levels of vitamin D in neonates and correlating the neonatal vitamin D levels with the maternal levels.
