Objective

This study aimed to quantitatively summarize the evidence for VDR BsmI gene polymorphism and osteoporosis risk in postmenopausal women.

Materials and methods

The PubMed, EMBASE, Weipu, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched for eligible studies. Case-control studies containing available genotype frequencies of B/b were chosen, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of this association.

Results

4485 osteoporosis and 5490 controls were identified in our meta-analysis. In the stratified analysis, a significant association was observed between VDR BsmI gene polymorphism and osteoporosis susceptibility in Caucasians (additive model: OR = 0.809, 95% CI 0.678~0.965, p = 0.019; recessive model: OR = 0.736, 95% CI 0.568~0.955, p = 0.021; and co-dominant model: bb vs. BB OR = 0.701, 95% CI 0.511~0.962 p = 0.028), and we failed to find any significant relationship in Asians.

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis suggests that VDR BsmI genotype is associated with increased risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Caucasians but not in Asians. To draw comprehensive and true conclusions, further prospective studies with larger numbers of participants worldwide are needed to examine associations between VDR BsmI polymorphism and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

#### Association Between Vitamin D Receptor BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2 Polymorphisms and Osteoporosis Risk: An Updated Meta-Analysis - July

Background: Many studies have reported the association between vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism and osteoporosis risk. However, their results were conflicting. Six previous meta-analyses have been published to analyze VDR BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2 polymorphisms on osteoporosis risk. However, they did not evaluate the reliability of statistically significant associations. Furthermore, a lot of new articles have been published on these themes, and therefore an updated meta-analysis was performed to further explore these issues.

Objectives: To explore the association between VDR BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2 polymorphisms polymorphisms and osteoporosis risk.

Methods: The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled to evaluate the association between VDR BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2 polymorphisms and osteoporosis risk. To evaluate the credibility of statistically significant associations, we applied the false-positive report probabilities (FPRP) test and the Venice criteria.

Results: Overall, statistically significantly increased osteoporosis risk was found in Indians and women for VDR FokI polymorphism. Statistically significantly decreased osteoporosis risk was found in West Asians for VDR BsmI polymorphism. However, when we performed an sensitivity analysis after excluding low quality and HWD studies, significantly decreased osteoporosis risk was only found in overall population for VDR BsmI polymorphism. 

Further, less-credible positive results were identified when we evaluated the credibility of positive results.</p> Conclusion: These positive findings should be interpreted with caution and indicate that significant association may most likely result from less-credible, rather than from true associations or biological factors on the VDR BsmI and FokI polymorphisms with osteoporosis risk.
