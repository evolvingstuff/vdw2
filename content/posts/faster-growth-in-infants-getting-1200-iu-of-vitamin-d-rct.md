Collagen X biomarker (CXM) is suggested to be a biomarker of linear growth velocity. However, early childhood data are limited. This study examines the relationship of CXM to the linear growth rate and bone development, including the possible modifying effects of vitamin D supplementation. We analyzed a cohort of 276 term-born children participating in the Vitamin D Intervention in Infants (VIDI) study. Infants received 10 μg/d (group-10) or 30 μg/d (group-30) vitamin D3 supplementation for the first two years of life. CXM and length were measured at 12 and 24 months of age. Tibial bone mineral content (BMC), volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), cross-sectional area (CSA), polar-moment of inertia (PMI), and periosteal circumference (PsC) were measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at 12 and 24 months. We calculated linear growth as length velocity (cm/year) and the growth rate in length (SD unit).

The mean (SD) CXM values were 40.2 (17.4) ng/ml at 12 months and 38.1 (12.0) ng/ml at 24 months of age (p=0.12). 

CXM associated with linear growth during the two years follow-up (p=0.041) but not with bone (p=0.53). Infants in group-30 in the highest tertile of CXM exhibited an accelerated mean growth rate in length compared with the intermediate tertile (mean difference (95% CI): -0.50 (-0.98, -0.01) SD unit, p=0.044) but not in the group-10 (p=0.062) at 12 months. 

Linear association of CXM and growth rate until 12 months was weak, but at 24 months CXM associated with both length velocity (B for 1 increment of √CXM (95% CI): 0.32 (0.12, 0.52) cm/year, p=0.002) and growth rate in length (0.20 (0.08, 0.32) SD unit, p=0.002). 

To conclude, CXM may not reliably reflect linear growth from birth to 12 months of age, but its correlation with growth velocity improves during the second year of life.
