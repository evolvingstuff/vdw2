# Importance of Vitamin D

Vitamin D is important in a number of physiologic processes, including  calcium  absorption,  innate  and  adaptive  immunity,  and  homeostasis  of  a  number  of  organs.  Chronic  vitamin D deficiency in adults results in osteoporosis, osteomalacia, muscle  weakness,  and  increased  risk  of  falls.1-4   Poor  vitamin D intake and low blood levels of vitamin D metabolites are associated with increased incidence and severity of several autoimmune diseases involving the T helper type 1 lymphocyte,5,6   including  multiple  sclerosis,7   rheumatoid  arthritis,8 type  I  diabetes,9   systemic  lupus  erythematosis,10   and  psoriasis.11,12  Lower levels of vitamin D, adjusted for body mass index,  are  also  associated  with  increased  risk  of  hypertension, myocardial infarction, and death as a result of cardiovascular disease.13-16

Of  particular  interest  to  oncologists  is  the  reduced  incidence of some epithelial malignancies, particularly breast and colon,  with  higher  intake  or  blood  levels  of  vitamin  D.17-23

In some observational studies, higher levels of vitamin D have also  been  associated  with  reduced  recurrence  and  mortality from  breast,  colon,  and  ovarian  cancers.24-28   Although  there is  evidence  that  vitamin  D  supplementation  can  improve muscle  strength  and  reduce  the  number  of  falls  among  the elderly and fractures resulting from osteoporosis,1,29-32  there is little direct evidence that low-dose vitamin D supplementation can  significantly  reduce  cancer  incidence  or  recurrence.  Reduction in cancer incidence was observed in a small placebocontrolled trial for calcium and vitamin D (1,100 IU/d), and this  reduction  seemed  greater  than  that  seen  with  calcium alone, when cancers arising in the first year of the trial were censored.33  However, no reduction in breast or colon cancer was  observed  for  the  calcium  and  vitamin  D  arm  in  the Women’s Health Initiative trial, in which the dose of vitamin D for the treatment arm was only 400 IU, and both the placebo and treatment arms were allowed to ingest nonstudy vitamin D up to 1,000 IU/d.34-36

Regardless of whether vitamin D helps prevent cancer or its recurrence, the high frequency of vitamin D inadequacy in the US population37,38  and the adverse impact on bone health of both vitamin D depletion and many of today’s systemic cancer treatments makes it important for oncologists to understand vitamin D physiology and recognize, treat, and prevent vitamin D deficiency.

## Vitamin D Metabolism and Its Role in Breast and Colon Homeostasis

Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), either ingested or manufactured in  the  skin  in  response  to  sun  exposure,  must  first  be  converted to the prohormone 25(OH)D in the liver and then to the active hormone 1,25(OH)2D by tissues containing the 1hydroxylase   enzyme.   The   active   form   of   vitamin   D—

1,25(OH)2D—may function in an endocrine fashion, as in the case of 1,25(OH)2D produced in the kidney, or an autocrine/ paracrine manner, as in the case of 1,25(OH)2D produced in several other organs in which vitamin D plays an important role in homeostasis (Fig 1). The breast and colon are two of these organs, and epithelial cells from both make 1,25(OH)2D from circulating precursors. In the breast, vitamin D seems to be  important  in  limiting  proliferation  and  neoangiogenesis in response to  hormones and growth factors and promoting differentiation.39-47 In the colon, vitamin D limits proliferation in response to bile acids and other carcinogens and promotes differentiation  and  expression  of  adhesion  and  cell-junction proteins.48-50

## Sources of Vitamin D and Standard Doses of Vitamin D Supplements

Vitamin D sufficiency is defined in terms of the serum level of the prohormone 25(OH)D required for bone health, which is 30 to 32 ng/mL. Maintenance of a 30 to 32 ng/mL serum level requires approximately 2,200 to 3,000 IU/d of vitamin D from all sources, including ultraviolet light exposure, food, and supplements.20,51,52   Recommendations  from  the  Institute  of Medicine for vitamin D supplementation suggest 200 IU of vitamin D daily from birth through age 50 years, 400 IU/d for individuals age 51 to 70 years, and 600 IU/d for those age 70 years or older.53  These recommendations presume some sun exposure and vitamin D intake from food and are not adequate to treat vitamin D deficiency.54,55  Historically, the source of most vitamin D has been ultraviolet light–induced skin manufacture of cholecalciferol. A single whole-body dose of ultraviolet  radiation  associated  with  minimal  erythema  produces 10,000 IU of vitamin D.55 Thus, 15 to 20 minutes of daily sun exposure without sunscreen in lower midwestern and southern latitudes between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM is usually sufficient to ensure adequate synthesis of vitamin D metabolites. Large excesses  of  vitamin  D3  from  prolonged  sun  exposure  are  destroyed  in  the  skin,  making  vitamin  D  toxicity  from  sun

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/fig-1.gif" alt="image">

exposure  improbable.54,55   In  contrast,  with  the  exception  of coldwater  ocean  fish,  food  is  a  poor  source  of  vitamin  D.54

Three ounces of herring, which few individuals eat, provides 1,300 IU of vitamin D, 3.5 oz of the more commonly ingested salmon provides 350 IU, and 1 teaspoon of cod liver oil provides approximately 400 IU. However, the amount of vitamin D in 1 cup of fortified milk or orange juice is only 100 IU, with 50-100 IU per cup of breakfast cereal or tablespoon of margarine.54,56,57 Today, with more time spent indoors and increased use of sunscreen, higher basal intakes of 1,000 to 2,000 IU/d from supplements are recommended to avoid vitamin D deficiency.23,58-60  Multiple vitamins generally contain 400 IU of vitamin D, and calcium supplements provide 200 to 400 IU of vitamin D. Vitamin D3 supplements without other additives are readily available over the counter in 400, 1,000, and 2,000  IU  strengths  at  pharmacies  and  most  grocery  stores. These supplements are much smaller in size than pills containing calcium and vitamin D and generally cost $10 or less for a 3-month supply. At similar doses, vitamin D3 may be more potent  than  vitamin  D2  (ergocalciferol),  which  is  obtained from plants.61  The Institute of Medicine lists 2,000 IU/d as the  upper  tolerable  limit,  but  in  fact,  there  is  little  evidence of  toxicity  unless  doses  of  10,000  IU  of  vitamin  D3/d  are exceeded.53,62

## Definition of Vitamin D Deficiency and Incidence in US Population

Vitamin D adequacy is currently defined as a function of calcium homeostasis, with lower vitamin D levels resulting in reduced absorption of calcium from the gut and/or elevations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) considered inadequate. Blood levels  of  the  prohormone  25(OH)D,  with  a  half-life  of  2  to  3 weeks, are used to describe vitamin D sufficiency rather than levels  of  1,25(OH)2D,  which  has  a  half-life  of  only  3  to  4 hours.54,58  Furthermore, in early vitamin D depletion, blood levels of 1,25(OH)2D can be misleading because they may rise initially in response to elevations in PTH, which is sensitive to til 25(OH)D reaches a minimum of 30 ng/mL, and PTH continues to decrease until this level is reached,64,65  a 25(OH)D serum level of 30 to 32 ng/mL is considered sufficient and levels of 20 to 29 ng/mL insufficient.

## Optimal Vitamin D Status

At  the  present  time,  25(OH)D  levels  in  the  range  of  30  to 60  ng/mL  are  considered  optimal,  but  higher  levels  up  to 100 ng/mL are often seen in individuals with outdoor occupations  receiving  intense  sun  exposure  without  ill  effects.55

Correlative studies of 25(OH)D with muscle strength or risk of breast or colon cancer have prompted several investigators to suggest that the optimal 25OHD target for multiple health outcomes  is  40  to  50  ng/mL.19,20   Garland  et  al23   suggest that increasing 25(OH)D to a range of 40 to 60 ng/mL from the current US average could reduce risk of breast cancer by 25% and colon cancer by 27%. Intakes of at least 4,000 IU daily from all sources would be needed to maintain 25(OH)D levels  of  40  to  60  ng/mL.  Practically  speaking,  supplements of 2,000 IU daily plus some sun exposure would probably be required  to  maintain  a  25(OH)D  level  of  40  to  60  ng/mL year round.23

## Vitamin D Toxicity

Vitamin D intoxication with renal stones and hypercalcemia may be observed when serum levels of 25(OH)D are greater than 150 ng/mL (374 nmol/L). For a good margin of safety, levels greater than 100 ng/mL should probably be avoided.

## Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency

The incidence of vitamin D deficiency (ie, 25(OH)D   20 ng/ mL) in US adults is approximately 25% for men and approximately   35%   for   women.38    Postmenopausal   women   with osteoporosis are especially likely to exhibit deficiency.1,63  The problem is not limited to older women. Seventy-four percent of a cohort of newly diagnosed premenopausal patients with breast cancer from the New York City area66  and 50% of a cohort of premenopausal women from the Kansas City area at high risk for the disease were reported as exhibiting vitamin D deficiency.67

# Who Should Have Serum 25(OH)D Levels Assessed?

Table 1. Recommendations for Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency or Insufficiency

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/t1.gif" alt="image">

# Frequency of Vitamin D Supplementation

We suggest obtaining a baseline 25(OH)D level in all individuals who are initiating therapy that could impact bone mineralization.  This  means  that  premenopausal  women  undergoing  chemotherapy  or  medical  or  surgical  ovarian  ablation and  postmenopausal  women  beginning  aromatase-inhibitor therapy should be tested. Estrogen upregulates both the 1hydroxylase enzyme that converts 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D and increases levels of vitamin D receptor protein.68,69  Thus, depletion of estrogen may unmask a subclinical vitamin D deficiency, which may increase the severity of muscle and joint symptoms experienced by women entering menopause or undergoing  aromatase-inhibitor  therapy.  For  cancer  survivors, 25(OH)D levels drawn in late winter or early spring will provide an estimation of trough levels of vitamin D.

## Individuals at High Risk for Vitamin D Deficiency

Individuals most likely to have vitamin D deficiency are those who  do  not  take  supplements,  are  elderly,54   are  darkly  pigmented,70  are obese,71  have osteoporosis or osteopenia,1  avoid any sun exposure without sunscreen,72,73  are typically veiled,74 live in a highly polluted environment,75 or have Crohn’s disease or other reasons for fat malabsorption.54

## Individuals With Symptoms of Vitamin D Deficiency

Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency can be rather nonspecific and include fatigue, altered mood and depression, insomnia, nonradicular back pain, arthralgias (particularly of the wrists, ankles, shoulders, and shins), proximal muscle weakness, headache,   and   hair   loss.76,77    Symptoms   are   uncommon   with 25(OH)D levels greater than 20 ng/mL, and even individuals with mild to moderate deficiency may not spontaneously complain of symptoms unless they are undergoing treatment that results in reduced formation of 1,25(OH)2D or decreased vitamin D receptor activation, such as estrogen depletion as the result of aromatase-inhibitor therapy. In a pilot study, we found that 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 weekly for 12 weeks was effective in  treating  vitamin  D  insufficiency  in  women  receiving  the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, and higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with reduced disability from aromatase inhibitor–associated joint pain.78

## How to Treat Vitamin D Deficiency

The first step in treating vitamin D deficiency is to obtain a baseline 25(OH)D blood level and then decide on the target replacement level and how quickly that target must be reached (Table 1). Each 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily in addition to what  the  patient  is  currently  ingesting  will  raise  the  level  of 25(OH)D by 10 ng/mL after a few weeks. Note that more may be required for individuals who are obese, because vitamin D is sequestered in adipose tissue.79

### NOTE. These doses are in addition to what the patient is ingesting at baseline. Patients receiving more than the equivalent of 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily in supplements  should  have  25(OH)D  levels  monitored  approximately  every  12 weeks.

A common example encountered by an oncologist would be that of an asymptomatic postmenopausal woman about to begin  aromatase-inhibitor  therapy  who  is  found  to  have  mild osteopenia. Her 25(OH)D level is 20 ng/mL. In addition to ensuring adequate calcium intake, if the target 25(OH)D serum level is 40 ng/mL, the simplest treatment is to ask her to take an extra 2,000 IU of over-the-counter vitamin D3, checking the 25(OH)D level again at 3 months. It should be cautioned  that  1%  of  the  population  may  have  occult  primary hyperparathyroidism, which may be unmasked by vitamin D and  calcium  supplementation,  resulting  in  hypercalcemia.80

For individuals of average weight with insufficiency only during the winter months who get appreciable sun exposure during the summer, we usually suggest vitamin D3 supplementation only during the late fall, winter, and early spring.

A different scenario might involve a woman with a body mass index of 35 kg/m2  ready to begin antihormonal therapy who already complains of fatigue, weakness, and diffuse arthralgias. A 25(OH)D level of 9 ng/mL shows evidence of severe vitamin D deficiency and is likely responsible for some or all of her symptoms. In this case, the 25(OH)D level should be increased as quickly as possible with either 4,000 IU vitamin D3 daily or 30,000 IU weekly, checking the level again at 6 and 12 weeks.  When  the  desired  level  is  achieved,  maintenance  of 40 ng/mL is usually possible with 2,000 IU per day, but in the case of obese women, higher doses may be needed.79

The  importance  of  educating  patients,  checking  compliance, and monitoring 25(OH)D levels every 3 months during treatment of deficiency and early maintenance phases cannot be overstressed.  Patients  easily  get  confused.  We  have  observed situations in which weekly high-dose vitamin D was taken daily by mistake. In summary, vitamin D plays an important role in the homeostasis of a variety of organ systems. The precise roles that vitamin D plays in prevention of cancer and recurrence— along with the blood levels necessary to carry out those roles— have  yet  to  be  defined.  In  the  meantime,  oncologists  are encouraged to check vitamin D levels in individuals about to undergo treatment that could impact bone and muscle health, replace deficiencies, and maintain 25(OH)D at levels optimum for musculoskeletal health.
