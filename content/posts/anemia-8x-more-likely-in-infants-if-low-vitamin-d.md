#### Bionics investigation of blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the interpretable biomechanics diagnosis of childhood anemia

Acta Biochim Pol. 2023 Sep 6. [doi: 10.18388/abp.2020_6676](https://doi.org/10.18388/abp.2020_6676)

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) causes a wide range of health problems, including anemia in infants. If not treated promptly, it may create serious issues for infants with long-term impacts. Therefore, a satisfactory solution to this problem is required. This investigation was to explore the correlation between the blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and childhood anemia. In this investigation, a cross-sectional examination was performed on 2,942 babies ranging in age from 2 to 36 months and classified into three cohorts: VDD (Vitamin D deficiency), VDI (Vitamin D insufficiency), and VDS (Vitamin D sufficiency). Multiple-variables and multinomially-related logistic regressions for examining the anemia status-vitamin D (Vit-D) relationship of the baseline as the interpretable visual quality models were examined. The median serum 25(OH)D level in 2,942 infants was 24.72±4.26 ng/l, with 661 cases (22.5%) of VDD and 1710 cases of deficiency (58.1%), and a noticeable seasonal variation (p<0.05). 

Anemia was present in 

* 28.5% of the VDD group compared with 

* 3.3% in vit-D sufficient infants (p<0.0001).

Lower levels of 25(OH)D were found to be associated with an increased risk of anemia in a multiple-variable regression analysis. In healthy children, low 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of anemia. Biologically inspired, primary care physicians should assess Vit-D levels and place a greater emphasis on adequate supplementation for deficiency prevention.
