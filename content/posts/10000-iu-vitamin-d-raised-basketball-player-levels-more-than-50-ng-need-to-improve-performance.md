#### Vitamin D in Basketball Players: Current Evidence and Future Directions

Sports Health. 2022 May-Jun; 14(3): 377–388. [doi: 10.1177/19417381211019343](https://doi.org/10.1177/19417381211019343)

Context:

Despite growing interest in quantifying and correcting vitamin D inadequacy in basketball players, a critical synthesis of these data is yet to be performed to overcome the low generalizability of findings from individual studies.

Objective:

To provide a comprehensive analysis of data in basketball pertaining to (1) the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy; (2) the effects of vitamin D supplementation on 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentration (and its association with body composition), bone health, and performance; and (3) crucial aspects that warrant further investigation.

Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE, ERIC, Google Scholar, SCIndex, and ScienceDirect databases were searched.

Study Selection: After screening, 15 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis.

Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Level of Evidence: Level 3.

Data Extraction: The prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy, serum 25(OH)D, body composition, stress fractures, and physical performance were extracted.

Results:

The pooled prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy for 527 basketball players in 14 studies was 77% (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 0.70-0.84). Supplementation with 4000 IU/d and 4000 IU/wk (absolute mean difference <span>[AMD]</span>: 25.39 nmol/L; P < 0.001; 95% CI, 13.44-37.33), as well as 10,000 IU/d (AMD: 100.01; P < 0.001; 95% CI, 70.39-129.63) vitamin D restored 25(OH)D to normal concentrations. Body composition data revealed inverse correlations between changes in serum 25(OH)D (from pre- to post supplementation) and body fat (r = −0.80; very large). Data concerning positive impacts of vitamin D supplementation on bone health and physical performance remain sparse.

Conclusion:

The high proportion of vitamin D inadequacy underscores the need to screen for serum 25(OH)D in basketball players. Although supplementation restored vitamin D sufficiency, the beneficial effects on bone health and physical performance remain sparse
