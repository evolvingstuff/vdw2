The epidemic strain of Zika was in French Polynesia in 2014.  
&nbsp;  
Sports people ([soccer or canoe](http://www.livescience.com/54161-when-did-zika-virus-enter-brazil.html)) flew their Zika-infected blood into Brazil.  
 &nbsp;  
Mosquitos in Brazil bit them and became infected with Zika.  
&nbsp;  
They have bitten and infected over a million people in the Western Hemisphere.  
Thousands of Zika birth defects have resulted.  
&nbsp;  
Over [500,000 people will fly out of Brazil after the Olympics in August.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/world/americas/brazil-zika-rio-olympics.html?_r=0)  
&nbsp;  
Thousands will carry Zika-blood around the globe and be bitten by compatable mosquitos.
