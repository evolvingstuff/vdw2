PURPOSE: To determine the relationship of serum vitamin D level with lung function, acute exacerbation, 6 minute walking (6MW) distance, and quality of life.

METHODS:

Of Korean Obstructive Lung Disease cohort, 193 COPD patients with yearly measured serum vitamind D were enrolled in this analysis. Using the cluster analysis of repeatly measured serum vitamin D level with adjustment of age, sex, BMI, pack-years and smoking, the relationship of serum vitamin D level with lung function, acute exacerbation, 6 minute walking distance, and and quality of life were evaluated

RESULTS:

Among the 193 COPD patients, 12 (6.2%), 28 (14.5%), and 153 (79.3%) patients were categorized as normal (≥ 30ng/mL), insufficiency (≥ 20ng/mL, &lt; 30ng/mL), and deficiency group (&lt; 20ng/mL). 

Clustered multivariate analysis showed that serum vitamin D level was related with 

* FEV1 ( **OR=0.01** , P=0.006), FEV1% (OR=0.379, P=0.006), 

* FEV1/FVC % (OR=0.003, P=0.001), 

but was not related with exacerbation (OR=0.988,P=0.391). 

Six minutes walking distance was also associated with serum vitamin D level (estimated mean =1.26, P=0.055). 

Dyspnea score after 6MW test decreased as serum vitamin D level increased (estimated mean = -0.037, P=0.018) while oxygen saturation after 6MW test increased as serum vitamin D level increased (estimated mean=0.104, P=0.033). However, no relationship was observed with St. George Respiratory Questionnaire scores.

CONCLUSIONS:

Serum vitamin D level is associated with lung function, physical activity, and dyspnea symptom after 6MW test in Korean COPD patients.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:

Serum vitamin D level might affect the health status of Korean COPD patients.
