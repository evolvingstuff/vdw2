#### [Summary by Grassroots Health](http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102200732336&ca=db8f831b-946c-48b8-b5a8-4d5fc2ebefce%20) May 2017

A study recently published by Srinivasan et al. looked at 25(OH)D serum levels of 80 preterm infants (gestation less than 34 weeks). Objectives of the study were to determine the vitamin D levels in the cord blood of these infants, randomly assign each infant to either 400 IU daily or 800-1000 IU daily supplementation, and then to correlate the serum vitamin D levels to neonatal morbidity and outcome of sepsis,  **retinopathy of prematurity (ROP),**  and delayed retinal maturation.

Within this group of premature infants:

*  **Late onset sepsis**  was present in 48 infants (60%)

> Those who developed sepsis had 25(OH)D levels of  **14** ±6 ng/ml 

> compared to infants who did not develop sepsis,  **31** ±10 ng/ml (P <0.01)

*  **ROP**  was present in 30 infants (37.5%)

> Those who developed ROP had 25(OH)D levels of  **16** ±11 ng/ml 

> compared to infants who did not develop ROP,  **34** ±18 ng/ml (P <0.03)

*  **Retinal maturation**  was delayed beyond 40 weeks in 34 infants (42.5%)

> Those whose retinal maturation was delayed beyond 40 weeks had 25(OH)D levels postnatally of  **12** ±6 ng/ml, 

> compared to infants who did not have delayed retinal maturation,  **26** ±7 ng/ml (P <0.02)

The paper concludes that the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for supplementation in infants of 400 IU is insufficient, and most infants require 800 - 1000 IU vitamin D soon after birth to maintain physiological vitamin D levels of ≥ 30 ng/ml, especially if they are exclusively breast fed.
