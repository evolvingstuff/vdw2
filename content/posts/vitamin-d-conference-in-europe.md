# MEP Parliamentary Questions from  **http://www.pa-international.org/MEP_Questions.htm** 

Below is a collection of written questions submitted to the European Commission by Members of the European Parliament on the subject of Vitamin D and Vitamin D deficiency. 

## Elena Oana Antonescu   11 May 2010   **Subject: Action to combat vitamin D deficiency** 

WRITTEN QUESTION by Elena Oana Antonescu (PPE) to the Commission 

Vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem associated with increased risks of osteoporosis, heart disease, tuberculosis, certain forms of cancer, diabetes, periodontitis, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue, depression, loss of muscular strength and the formation of adipose tissue. It is estimated that over 50 % of adults suffer from vitamin D deficiency, with numbers significantly exceeding the European average in certain countries (the problem being more acute in Spain and the eastern European countries than in the northern European countries(1)).

The problem has many causes, depending on geographic location, age, exposure to the sun and diet. A comprehensive approach to it must take account of such diverse factors if an effective solution is to be found. In general, efforts to resolve the problem have been concentrated on vitamin D supplements (2) contained in pharmaceuticals or vitaminised foods.

Does the Commission intend to propose a set of harmonised EU policies to reduce vitamin D deficiency levels, aside from setting minimum and maximum dose levels regarding food supplements, which get to grips with other contributory factors?

## Ioannis A. Tsoukalas, Theodoros Skylakakis and Anja Weisgerber  7 May 2010   **Subject: Vitamin D deficiency** 

WRITTEN QUESTION by Ioannis A. Tsoukalas (PPE) , Theodoros Skylakakis (PPE) and Anja Weisgerber (PPE) to the Commission 

The European population's exposure to sunlight, which is the main source for Vitamin D intake, has been decreasing due to the evolution of modern lifestyles and change of habits. Vitamin D is essential for bone and muscle health as well as for the general health of the human body. The deficiency of this vitamin is related to serious diseases, including osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, some types of cancer, diabetes mellitus, increased susceptibility to infections and, consequently, increased mortality (1). It is reported that at least 50 % of the European population is presenting a Vitamin D deficiency (2). It is also reported that the treatment of Vitamin D deficiency in the European population by receiving 1 000 IU of Vitamin D daily could lead to a reduction in mortality caused by cancer(3).

Increasing the intake of foods enriched with sufficient vitamin amounts can contribute to tackling the problem. However, the production of such foods is not possible, due to the fact that the existing limit for Vitamin D is 5 ?g (200 IU — International Units, Directive 2008/100/EC(4)), a percentage that is also reported not to correspond to current scientific data that suggest a minimum of 20 ?g (800 IU).

Vitamin D is not covered by any patent and its production is comparatively low-cost, therefore there is a lack of significant economic interest encouraging its widespread consumption.

In light of the above, the Commission is asked to answer the following questions:

1. How does it intend to use the data available on the benefits of Vitamin D, and what measures are planned by the Commission and the Member States in order to deal with Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in the European population?

2. Does the Commission intend to proceed to a review of the current limits so that the production of foods enriched with sufficient quantities of Vitamin D is enabled?

3. Does the Commission possess data on the estimated decrease of the costs to European health systems which would arise from the intake of adequate amounts of Vitamin D by the population?

4. Does the Commission intend to take steps to inform health professionals and consumers on the effects of Vitamin D deficiency, and encourage Member States to do the same?

5. How does the Commission intend to reinforce research on the status of the European population concerning Vitamin D, its effects on its health and the possible negative side-effects resulting from an increased intake of this vitamin? Which relevant research actions are funded by the EC?

## Jim Higgins 9 April 2010   **Subject: Vitamin D** 

WRITTEN QUESTION by Jim Higgins (PPE) to the Commission 

In view of the fact that 50% of the EU's population is deficient in Vitamin D, and that Vitamin D is not only essential for optimal bone and muscle health, but is also a key preventative factor in warding off diseases such as osteoporosis, heart diseases, many forms of cancer, diabetes, asthma and multiple sclerosis, is the Commission planning to propose any public education programmes in order to highlight the nutritional importance of Vitamin D?

## 28 May 2010  Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission

The Commission is aware of the importance that a deficiency of vitamin D may have for different aspects of human health and possible applications in disease prevention.

The Commission's only instrument to give financial support to work on awareness-raising on public health is the EU Health Programme. However, given that nutritional advice is best given at Member State level and considering the fact that further scientific research on vitamin D deficiency is needed, the Commission does not envisage at this moment action on awareness-raising on vitamin D deficiency under the EU Health Programme.

## Syed Kamall 8 March 2010   **Subject: Vitamin D supplements** 

WRITTEN QUESTION by Syed Kamall (ECR) to the Commission 

I have been contacted by constituents regarding vitamin D supplements. My constituent has told me that British people need higher levels of vitamin D supplements than those in sunny EU countries and that new studies has shown that rickets bone disease has increased to several hundred cases a year in the UK because of a shortage of vitamin D in children. The studies have also shown that over half the UK adult population were shown to be deficient in vitamin D during spring and winter.

My constituents are concerned that the EU Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC(1)) threatens to remove considerable numbers of safe and popular higher potency food supplements, particularly vitamins and minerals, from the UK market. They claim that this would lead to the closure of large numbers of health food stores and the potential loss of thousands of jobs across the UK.

Could the Commission confirm whether:

1. The maximum permitted dose levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will not be set at unnecessarily low levels;

2. The new EU Health Commissioner will make sure that his officials do not bring forward proposals which will deny millions of consumers across Europe continued access to safe and popular higher potency vitamin and mineral supplements of their choice?

(1) OJ L 183, 12.7.2002, p. 51.

## 22 March 2010    Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission

Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients but in some cases excessive intake can lead to adverse health effects. The maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals present in food supplements foreseen by Article 5 of Directive 2002/46/EC(1) will be established on a safety basis taking into account scientific assessment carried out by the European Food Safety Authority(2) and by other recognised scientific assessment bodies. Those criteria listed in Article 5 include:

—upper safe levels of the vitamins and minerals established by scientific risk assessment (UL, the maximum level of total chronic intake of a nutrient judged to be unlikely to pose risk of adverse health effects to humans);

—intake of vitamins and minerals from other dietary sources.

The reference intakes of vitamins and minerals for the population will also be considered when establishing these maximum amounts.

The work on setting maximum amounts is ongoing, but no proposal has yet been presented. The Commission has consulted extensively with Member States and interested stakeholders on the issue. All the available data on the potential effects on economic operators and consumers of the setting of maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals in foods, including food supplements will be taken into account. However, whilst the economic impact of the levels will be taken into account, the levels will be set based on risk assessment. Every effort will be made to ensure that the maximum amounts set will take into account the concerns expressed by all interested parties.

The Commission will take proportionate risk management measures to ensure that the widest possible range of safe food supplement is available for consumers, avoiding at the same time the risks of both deficiency and excessive intakes.

In conclusion, Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements will not result in reduction of consumers' choice but will rather ensure that food supplements placed on the market contain nutrients at safe levels and thus will allow consumers to choose from a wide range of safe products. In that context, the Commission is convinced that an adequate range of vitamin D supplements will be available.
