#### [Zika Virus Disease in Colombia — Preliminary Report](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1604037?query=featured_home#t=article%20)  
 New England Journal of Medicine June 15, 2016

* “Laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection has been found in four infants born with microcephaly so far, all among women with  **asymptomatic**  Zika virus infection”

>  **Being asymptomatic in** first trimester **does not apparently eliminate microcephaly risk** 

* “In our analysis of a subgroup of 1850 pregnant women, more than 90% who were reportedly infected during the third trimester have delivered with  **no cases of microcephaly** .”

> Note – they do not seem to consider vision, hearing and muscle tone problems to be Zika birth defects

* “They suggest a name for these effects:  **Zika virus congenital syndrome** . Babies have been born with a range of brain and eye defects and some have also been abnormally small.”

* “ There's more than microcephaly. There is a spectrum of disease.”

* "They found  **29 % of the fetuses**  had some sort of problem, from brain damage to damage to the placenta”
