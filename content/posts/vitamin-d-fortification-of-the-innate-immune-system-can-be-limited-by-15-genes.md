 **Figure 5.**  Functional profile of key immune-related vitamin D target genes. 

Schematic picture of a cell indicating the main location of the proteins encoded by the 15 key genes. 

The information is based on GeneCards (www.genecards.org) and publications cited in the text. 

The classification of the proteins (group 1: orange, group 2: green, group 3: blue) is based on their transcriptome profile (Figure 4). 

The main immune-related function of the protein groups is indicated in<span style="color:#F00;">red.</span>
