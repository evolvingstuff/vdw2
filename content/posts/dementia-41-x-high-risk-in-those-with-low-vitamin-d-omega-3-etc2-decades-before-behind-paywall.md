Background: Low blood status in several nutritional compounds, including long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), carotenoids, and vitamin D, have been associated with a higher risk to develop dementia. Nutritional deficiencies may potentiate each other regarding dementia risk; yet the association of multiple nutritional deficiencies with dementia has been little explored.

Objective: To develop an index of micronutritional biological status (MNBS) for the screening of multi-micronutritional deficiencies associated with the risk of dementia in a prospective population-based cohort of older persons.

Methods: We included participants from the Bordeaux Three-City study, who were free of dementia at baseline, had blood measurements of LC n-3 PUFA, carotenoids, and 25(OH)D, and who were followed for up to 18 years for dementia. We used penalized splines in Cox models to model dose-response relationships of each nutritional component with the risk of dementia and construct a risk index.

Results: 629 participants with an average age of 73.1 years were included in the study. Each increase of 1 SD of the MNBS index was associated with a 46%higher risk of dementia (HR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.23; 1.73). Participants with highest index (<span>[mean+1SD; max]</span>) had a 4-fold increased risk of dementia compared with participants with a low index (<span>[min; mean-1SD]</span>) (HR = 4.17, 95%CI 2.30; 7.57).

Conclusion: This index of assessment of micronutritional biological status is a practical tool that may help identify populations with inadequate nutritional status, screen eligible individuals for nutritional prevention in primary care, or for supplementation in preventive trials of dementia.
