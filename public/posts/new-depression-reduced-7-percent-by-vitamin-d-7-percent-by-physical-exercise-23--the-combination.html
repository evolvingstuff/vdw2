#### Synergistic impact of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and physical activity on incident depression: Evidence from a prospective cohort and genome-wide data

J Affect Disord 2025 Jun 1:378:235-241. [doi: 10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.004)   PDF is behind a $38 paywall, but references are free

Background: The relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D &lt;span&gt;[25(OH)D]&lt;/span&gt; levels, physical activity (PA), and depression risk remains underexplored. This study examines how combinations of 25(OH)D and PA influence depression.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, including cognitively healthy adults aged 50 years and older at baseline. Baseline measurements of PA and 25(OH)D were taken, with depression as the primary outcome. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used, with and without interaction terms. Furthermore, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed.

Results: A total of 4146 participants (mean age: 66.0 years; 52.1 % female) were followed for eight years.

Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for depression were

* 0.71 (95 % CI: 0.61-0.83) for those with high 25(OH)D and

* PA (P = 0.005),

   * 0.79 (95 % CI: 0.63-0.99) for those younger than 65 (P = 0.042), and

   * 0.65 (95 % CI: 0.53-0.80) for those 65 and older (P = 0.041).

A significant interaction between low 25(OH)D and PA was found in the younger group (HR: 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.99, P = 0.034).

High 25(OH)D and PA independently reduced depression risk by 7.2 % and 7.7 %, respectively, with a  **23.1 % reduction when combined** . Mendelian randomization confirmed these findings.

Conclusions: High 25(OH)D levels are linked to lower depression risk. The combination of high 25(OH)D and PA provides synergistic protection, particularly in older adults, emphasizing the need for vitamin D supplementation and PA in depression prevention.

#### [Perplexity AI confirms - more exercise, less depression](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-association-betwee-06vLK1E7S0OvDWsV.6aNDQ)

The association between exercise and depression is significant and beneficial.

Research consistently shows that physical activity is linked to a reduced risk of depression and can alleviate depressive symptoms[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/).

 **Key findings on the exercise-depression association include:** 

1. Dose-response relationship: An inverse curvilinear association exists between physical activity and depression risk, with steeper benefits observed at lower activity levels[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/).

1. Risk reduction: Adults accumulating half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week) had an 18% lower risk of depression compared to inactive individuals[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/).

1. Optimal benefit: Those achieving the recommended volume of 8.8 mMET hours per week (equivalent to 2.5 hours of brisk walking) experienced a 25% lower risk of depression[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/).

1. Prevention potential: If less active adults had met current physical activity recommendations, an estimated 11.5% of depression cases could have been prevented[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/).

1. Types of effective exercise: Walking, jogging, yoga, and strength training appear to be particularly effective in treating depression[4](https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847).

1. Mechanisms: Exercise may benefit mental health through various pathways, including acute neuroendocrine responses (e.g., &quot;runner&#39;s high&quot;), changes in brain neural architecture, improved self-perceptions, and increased social interactions[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780).

1. Long-term effects: Studies have shown that the positive effects of exercise on depression can be maintained even months after the intervention[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC474733/).

The evidence strongly suggests that health practitioners should encourage any increase in physical activity to improve mental health, as even small amounts of exercise can provide significant benefits in reducing the risk of depression[1](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/).

Background: The relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, physical activity (PA), and depression risk remains underexplored. This study examines how combinations of 25(OH)D and PA influence depression.

Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, including cognitively healthy adults aged 50 years and older at baseline. Baseline measurements of PA and 25(OH)D were taken, with depression as the primary outcome. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used, with and without interaction terms. Furthermore, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed.

Results: A total of 4146 participants (mean age: 66.0 years; 52.1 % female) were followed for eight years.
Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for depression were

*0.71 (95 % CI: 0.61-0.83) for those with high 25(OH)D and
*PA (P = 0.005),
**0.79 (95 % CI: 0.63-0.99) for those younger than 65 (P = 0.042), and
**0.65 (95 % CI: 0.53-0.80) for those 65 and older (P = 0.041).
A significant interaction between low 25(OH)D and PA was found in the younger group (HR: 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.99, P = 0.034).

High 25(OH)D and PA independently reduced depression risk by 7.2 % and 7.7 %, respectively, with a __23.1 % reduction when combined__. Mendelian randomization confirmed these findings.

Conclusions: High 25(OH)D levels are linked to lower depression risk. The combination of high 25(OH)D and PA provides synergistic protection, particularly in older adults, emphasizing the need for vitamin D supplementation and PA in depression prevention.

!!!! [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-association-betwee-06vLK1E7S0OvDWsV.6aNDQ|Perplexity AI confirms - more exercise, less depression]
The association between exercise and depression is significant and beneficial.
Research consistently shows that physical activity is linked to a reduced risk of depression and can alleviate depressive symptoms[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780|1][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/|3].

__Key findings on the exercise-depression association include:__
#Dose-response relationship: An inverse curvilinear association exists between physical activity and depression risk, with steeper benefits observed at lower activity levels[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780|1][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/|3].
#Risk reduction: Adults accumulating half the recommended volume of physical activity (4.4 marginal metabolic equivalent task hours per week) had an 18% lower risk of depression compared to inactive individuals[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/|3].
#Optimal benefit: Those achieving the recommended volume of 8.8 mMET hours per week (equivalent to 2.5 hours of brisk walking) experienced a 25% lower risk of depression[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780|1][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/|3].
#Prevention potential: If less active adults had met current physical activity recommendations, an estimated 11.5% of depression cases could have been prevented[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/|3].
#Types of effective exercise: Walking, jogging, yoga, and strength training appear to be particularly effective in treating depression[https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-075847|4].
#Mechanisms: Exercise may benefit mental health through various pathways, including acute neuroendocrine responses (e.g., &quot;runner&#39;s high&quot;), changes in brain neural architecture, improved self-perceptions, and increased social interactions[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780|1].
#Long-term effects: Studies have shown that the positive effects of exercise on depression can be maintained even months after the intervention[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC474733/|2].
The evidence strongly suggests that health practitioners should encourage any increase in physical activity to improve mental health, as even small amounts of exercise can provide significant benefits in reducing the risk of depression[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790780|1][https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35416941/|3].
