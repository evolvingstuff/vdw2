This was a study of 11,000 Australians in 2008

A previous study in June 2011 found that for every 2 hours of additional TV watching there was a 13% increase of dying in the next 7 years

Possible reasons which they listed: lack of exercise, tendency to eat junk food

Note: Disadvantaged and people who have not finished high school watch TV more and do not live as long.

VitaminDWiki adds a reason: By using TV/video games/multimedia  not get out in the sun as much.

Would be nice to find a study of how much vitamin D levels decrease with hours of watching TV.

# Sanity check

5 hours of TV a day = 1825 per year = 91,250 per 50 years

20 minutes = 1/3 hour.

1/3 * 91,250 = 30,416 hours = 1267 days = 3.5 years: possible
