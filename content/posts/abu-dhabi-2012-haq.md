# Global Vitamin D Deficiency and its Role in Health and Disease

There is an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency sweeping across our modern world, and it's an epidemic of such magnitude and seriousness that is not only alarmingly widespread but a root cause of many serious diseases such as rickets, MS, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, tuberculosis and heart disease. Public interest in vitamin D is rising because there is intense and growing activity in the research community on the functions and benefits of vitamin D. People living near the equator who are exposed to sunlight without sun protection have robust levels of 25- hydroxyvitamin D above 75 nmol/L . 

However, even in the sunniest areas, vitamin D deficiency is common when most of the skin is shielded from the sun. Studies in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Turkey, India, and Lebanon, 30 to 50% of children and adults had 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels under 50 nmol/L. Vitamin D ability to bind to vitamin D binding protein, enables it to reach other districts(cells and tissues of the body) that will be its target. After binding of active form of vitamin D i.e. 1,25(OH)2D to its receptor(VDR)these effects create an environment suitable for gene transcription. Vitamin D is truly remarkable in that it plays a key role in a wide range of physiologic functions.
