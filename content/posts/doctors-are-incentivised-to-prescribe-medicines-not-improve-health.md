#### How PCPs are penalized for positive outcomes from lifestyle change

 **[MD Edge](https://www.mdedge.com/familymedicine/article/265926/business-medicine/how-pcps-are-penalized-positive-outcomes-lifestyle/page/0/1?ecd=WNL_EVE_231016_mdedge)** 

 **One example: Dr. reduced diabetes by lifestyle changes** 

* However, the CMS 5-Star Rating System assigned the primary care physician a grade of C rather than A, which put the physician›s 5-star rating at risk. Why? Because the system  **bases its score largely on medication compliance** . The physician was penalized despite achieving the optimal health outcome, and at a lower cost than with medication. "

 **Medicare incentivizes disease management, not disease reversal** 

* "Rather than automatically managing disease with ever-increasing quantities of costly medications and procedures, lifestyle medicine clinicians first pursue a goal of health restoration when appropriate. But Medicare risk adjustment incentivizes physicians to manage rather than reverse disease. "

* "But a physician utilizing diet alone to achieve remission in a patient with type 2 diabetes is penalized financially because, when the risk is adjusted, diabetes is no longer listed among the patient›s conditions.  **So, Medicare pays the physician less money.**  That misalignment incentivizes clinicians to manage the symptoms of type 2 diabetes rather than achieve remission, despite remission being the ideal clinical outcome."

__One example: Dr. reduced diabetes by lifestyle changes__
*However, the CMS 5-Star Rating System assigned the primary care physician a grade of C rather than A, which put the physician›s 5-star rating at risk. Why? Because the system __bases its score largely on medication compliance__. The physician was penalized despite achieving the optimal health outcome, and at a lower cost than with medication. &quot;
__Medicare incentivizes disease management, not disease reversal__
*&quot;Rather than automatically managing disease with ever-increasing quantities of costly medications and procedures, lifestyle medicine clinicians first pursue a goal of health restoration when appropriate. But Medicare risk adjustment incentivizes physicians to manage rather than reverse disease. &quot;
*&quot;But a physician utilizing diet alone to achieve remission in a patient with type 2 diabetes is penalized financially because, when the risk is adjusted, diabetes is no longer listed among the patient›s conditions. __So, Medicare pays the physician less money.__ That misalignment incentivizes clinicians to manage the symptoms of type 2 diabetes rather than achieve remission, despite remission being the ideal clinical outcome.&quot;
