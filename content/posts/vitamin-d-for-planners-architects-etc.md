First publication Vitamin D Wiki has seen on the subject

[CLICK HERE](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=2067) for PDF 

Published by [Chief Health Officer Victoria Australia – May 2010](http://www.health.vic.gov.au/chiefhealthofficer/publications.htm)

This publication is a good first start, including many good points

## Hopefully future versions of papers like this one will point out that:

* Differences between UVA (suntan) and UVB (make vitamin D)

* UVB is about 3X less in shade, and UVA is reduced even more

* Windows do not transmit any UVB to generate vitamin D

> And that it may be that the UVA transmitted by windows uses up some of the vitamin D

* UVB lighting is possible from special lamps inside of offices (truly full spectrum)

* UVB reflects poorly from buildings – so not as much vitamin D at the bottom of an urban canyon

* There is less UVB in large cities due to pollution/ozone
