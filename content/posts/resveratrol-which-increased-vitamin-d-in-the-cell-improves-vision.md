#### The Role of Resveratrol in Eye Diseases—A Review of the Literature

Nutrients 2022, 14(14), 2974; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14142974

by Anna Bryl et al

Resveratrol (3,5,4′-trans-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin belonging to the stilbene family. It is commonly found in grape skins and seeds, as well as other plant-based foods. Oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role in the initiation and progression of age-related eye disorders (glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration) that lead to a progressive loss of vision and blindness. Even though the way resveratrol affects the human body and the course of many diseases is still the subject of ongoing scientific research, it has been shown that the broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of resveratrol has a beneficial effect on eye tissues. In our research, we decided to analyze the current scientific literature on resveratrol, its possible mechanisms of action, and its therapeutic application in order to assess its effectiveness in eye diseases.
