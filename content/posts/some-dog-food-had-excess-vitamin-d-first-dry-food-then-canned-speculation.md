#### [Why so many excess Vitamin D Recalls?](https://truthaboutpetfood.com/why-so-many-excess-vitamin-d-recalls/) truth about pet food.com

* “After the first two initial dog food recalls, seven more dry dog food recalls occurred up to December 5, 2018. For 8 weeks we saw no new excess Vitamin D recalls, and then on January 31, 2019 we learned of a Hill’s Pet Nutrition recall for 25 different varieties of canned dog foods.”

* “Because the FDA has not informed pet owners, we don’t know if this concerning problem was/is a vitamin premix formulation error or if this is a pet food manufacturing error.”

 **Comments by a reader** 

“Hill’s Pet Nutrition learned of the potential for elevated vitamin D levels in some of our canned dog foods after receiving a complaint in the United States about a dog exhibiting signs of elevated vitamin D levels. Our investigation confirmed elevated levels of vitamin D due to a  **supplier error** .”
