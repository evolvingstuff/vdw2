#### Concluding remarks - clipped from PDF

There is a growing body of evidence that VitD, especially its active metabolite, plays a key role in modulating the physiological activity of the immune system. This emergent role has stimulated a florid line of research aimed at associating the level of VitD with pathological situations wherein the immune system may be altered, such as in autoimmunity and inflammation.

In these studies, 25OHD, the actual  **precursor of the active hormone calcitriol** , is what has been routinely measured, circulating in the blood at ng/mL concentrations. This measurement, performed with either LCMS or immunoassay, has recently become significantly more reliable consequent to marked gains in com- mutability enabled by the broad acceptance of and adherence to an international standardization program.

Several epidemiological studies of observational nature have been conducted to correlate circulating levels of 25OHD with autoimmune and inflammatory disease parameters. Overall, the studies have shown an inverse relationship between 25OHD and the clinical manifestations of a given disease. At the same time, circulating levels of sufficiency/insufficiency have been proposed by major medical organizations such as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) <sup>[43]</sup> and Endocrine Society <sup>[51]</sup>, with different thresholds belying slightly different demographic perspectives. While associations with the disease are strong and potential mechanisms tractable, still the role of the VitD in inflammation and autoimmunity deserve large and well controlled clinical studies.

VitD supplementation has not always diminished the severity of clinical manifestations.  **<span style="color:#00F;">A likely explanation of these perceptually negative outcomes, is that the majority of these studies attempted correlations with measured levels of precursor 25OHD and not the active hormone per se. Testing circulating levels of calcitriol might support the establishment of more robust disease correlates between the biologically active VitD metabolite and pathological conditions.</span>**
