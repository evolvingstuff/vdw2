Injection is just one way to quickly raise vitamin D levels

Similar 300,000 IU of vitamin D might provide similar results it taken orally.

Might achieve a higher level of vitamin D with loading dose spread out over several days

A second injection on day 2 would probably have helped

Wonder when they will try putting Vitamin D into IV solution - will probably be faster

Wonder when they will try additional topical vitamin D near the source of the infection

Wonder when they will try adding Omega-3 - which also greatly reduces Sepsis

 **[Sepsis is both prevented and treated by Vitamin D - many studies](/posts/sepsis-is-both-prevented-and-treated-by-vitamin-d-many-studies) some of it's table of contents as of April 2018** 

200,000 and 400,000 IU of vitamin D reduced septic shock, length of stay - RCT June 2015

2.9 X more likely to recover from Septic Shock in 24 hours if > 10 ng - 2017

Two Meta-analyses of ICU and Vitamin D - April and May 2017

High dose + maint. dose Vitamin D reduce mortality – large RCT Amrein 2014

The only people who died of sepsis in the hospital were vitamin D deficient – April 2017

Infants with sepsis have very low Vitamin D levels – Aug 2014

Meta-analysis concludes: Sepsis 1.8 X more likely if low vitamin D - June 2015

Vitamin D - a new hope for septic shock - July 2013

Sever sepsis increased 3.5X in a decade

Sepsis injection of 300,000 IU of vitamin D helped in a small RCT Feb 2017

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prescribing vitamin D on improving the symptoms of patients diagnosed with urosepsis. The participants were randomly divided into two equal groups (each consisting of 50 patients). The patients in the first group received standard treatment with  **300 000 units of injected vitamin**  with a volume of 1 cc. As for the patients in the second group, they received standard treatment along with 1 cc normal saline injected to them as placebo. Vital signs of the patients were checked every 6 h, while their CBC, EXR, CRP, creatinine, urea, and uric acid were checked 0, 24, 48, and 72 h following the interventions. Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels were measured 72 h following injection of the medicine. 

A significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the number of WBC's in 24th, 48th, and 72nd hours. 

A similarly significant difference was reported between the case and control group in terms of the average BUN within 24th, 48th, and 72nd hours. The difference observed between the two groups in terms of average Cr within the 0th, 24th, 48th, and 72nd hours and in terms of  **days of hospitalization was also significant** . Considering these results and keeping in mind the fact that no particular side effects were reported as a result of utilizing muscular injections of vitamin D and the easy and cheap use of this medicine, it can be used in auxiliary treatment of patients with urosepsis.

 **From the PDF** 

* Does not indicate when the vitamin D injection was given – appears to be less than 1 day

*  **The average length of hospitalization in control and case group was 5.44  and 3.76** 

* Vitamin D level went to 10 ng to 24 ng by 72 hours

> No other measurements of Vitamin D levels were reported (probably tests were too expensive)
