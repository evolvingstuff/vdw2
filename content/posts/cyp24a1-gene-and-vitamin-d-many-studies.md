### CYP24A1: cancer, autoimmune and inflamation via genetics and epigenetics - Oct 2024

 **Regulatory Mechanisms and Pathological Implications of CYP24A1 in Vitamin D Metabolism** 

Pathology - Research and Practice

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prp.2024.155684](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prp.2024.155684) a portion of the PDF is online

CYP24A1 is a crucial gene within the cytochrome P450 superfamily, responsible for encoding the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase. This enzyme is involved in the catabolism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the biologically active form of vitamin D3, by hydroxylating its side chain. Through this process, CYP24A1 tightly regulates the bioavailability and physiological impact of vitamin D3 in the body. 

Dysregulation of CYP24A1, particularly its overexpression, has been increasingly associated with the progression of various diseases, including 

* cancers, 

* autoimmune disorders, and 

* chronic inflammatory conditions. 

Elevated levels of CYP24A1 can lead to excessive degradation of vitamin D3, resulting in diminished levels of this critical hormone, which is essential for calcium homeostasis, immune function, and cellular proliferation. This review explores into the structural characteristics of CYP24A1, exploring how it influences its enzymatic activity. Furthermore, it examines the expression patterns of CYP24A1 across different diseases, emphasizing the enzyme's role in disease pathology. The review also discusses the regulatory mechanisms governing CYP24A1 expression, including 

* genetic mutations, 

* epigenetic modifications, and 

* metabolite-mediated regulation. 

By understanding these mechanisms, the review provides insight into the potential therapeutic strategies that could target CYP24A1, aiming to alleviate its overexpression and restore vitamin D3 balance in disease states.

### Rare CYP24A1 variant results in hypercalcemia in infants - Sept 2023

 **Clinical heterogeneity and therapeutic options for idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia caused by CYP24A1 pathogenic variant

J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab . 2023 Sep 29. [doi: 10.1515/jpem-2023-0147](https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2023-0147)

Objectives: Infantile hypercalcemia-1(HCINF1) is a** rare disease **caused by pathogenic variants in the CYP24A1 gene, resulting in the inability to metabolize active vitamin D. This leads to hypercalcemia and severe complications.

Content: On December 8th, 2022, a systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Wanfang, and CNKI using the keywords "hypercalcemia" and "CYP24A1". Data extraction included patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment medications, and outcomes. The findings were synthesized to identify common patterns and variations among cases and to assess the efficacy of different therapies in reducing serum calcium. Our findings revealed two distinct peaks in the incidence of HCINF1 caused by CYP24A1 pathogenic variant.** Kidney stones or renal calcifications were the most common clinical manifestations of the disease **, followed by polyuria and developmental delay. Laboratory investigations showed hypercalcemia, elevated vitamin D levels, hypercalciuria, and low parathyroid hormone. Genetic analysis remains the only reliable diagnostic tool. Although there is no definitive cure for HCINF1, multiple drugs, including bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and rifampicin, have been used to control its symptoms.** Blocking the production and intake of vitamin D is the preferred treatment option. **Summary and outlook: Our review highlights the basic clinical and biochemical features of HCINF1 and suggests that targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are needed to address the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. The insights gained from this study may facilitate the development of innovative treatments for HCINF1.** References **1. Hmami, F, Oulmaati, A, Amarti, A, Kottler, ML, Bouharrou, A.

In this review, we discuss the possibility of the vitamin D metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 being a therapeutic target for various tumors including breast, colorectal and prostate tumors. Given the pleiotropic cellular activity of vitamin D, its deficiency impairs its physiological function in target cells and results in various pathologies including cancer. In addition, accumulated data have shown that elevated expression of CYP24A1 promotes carcinogenesis in various cancer subtypes by decreasing the bioavailability of vitamin D metabolites. 

Thus, we propose the potential feasibility of vitamin D metabolism-blocking therapy in various types of human malignancies that express constitutive CYP24A1.** References **1.

Jones G1, Prosser DE, Kaufmann M.

Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada K7L 3N6. gj1@queensu.ca** CYP24A1 is the cytochrome P450 component **of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-24-hydroxylase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25-OH-D(3)) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)) into 24-hydroxylated products, which constitute the degradation of the vitamin D molecule. This review focuses on recent data in the CYP24A1 field, including biochemical, physiological and clinical developments. Notable among these are: the first crystal structure for rat CYP24A1; mutagenesis studies which change the regioselectivity of the enzyme; and the finding that natural inactivating mutations of CYP24A1 cause the genetic disease idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH). The review also discusses the emerging correlation between rising serum phosphate/FGF-23 levels and increased CYP24A1 expression in chronic kidney disease, which in turn underlies accelerated degradation of both serum 25-OH-D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in this condition.

### Rifampin (an anti-TB drug) reactivated the CYP24A1 gene in one person, stopping Hypercalcemia - May 2022

Long-term efficacy and safety of rifampin in the treatment of a patient carrying a CYP24A1 loss-of-function variant

J Clin Endocrinol Metab . 2022 May 15;dgac315. [doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgac315](https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgac315)  PDF is behind a $39 paywall [and DeepDyve](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/vitamin-d-metabolism-in-cancer-potential-feasibility-of-vitamin-d-k1MiJ0l79K?key=springer)

Background: Pharmacological therapy may be useful in the treatment of moderate to severe hypercalcemia in patients with infantile hypercalcemia-1 (HCINF1) due to pathogenic variants in the cytochrome P450 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1). Rifampin is an antituberculosis drug that is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4), involved in an alternative catabolic pathway of vitamin D. The efficacy of rifampin in improving hypercalcemia was previously reported but many questions remain on the long-term efficacy and safety. Aim of the study is to test the long-term efficacy and safety of rifampin in a patient with HCINF1.

Methods: We report clinical, biochemical and imaging features of a 23-year-old man affected by HCINF1 with moderate hypercalcemia (12.9 mg/dL), symptomatic nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and impaired kidney function (eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) treated with rifampin for an overall period of 24 months. Kidney, liver and adrenal function were evaluated at every follow-up visit.

Results: In 2 months, rifampin induced a normalization of serum calcium (9.6 mg/dL) associated with an improvement of kidney function (eGFR 92 mL/min/1.73 m2) stable during the treatment. After 15 months, rifampin was temporally withdrawn because of asthenia, unrelated to impairment of adrenal function. After three months, the timing of drug administration was shifted from the morning to the evening, obtaining the remission of asthenia. At the end of follow-up, the nephrolithiasis disappeared and the nephrocalcinosis was stable.

Conclusions: Rifampin could represent an effective choice to induce a stable reduction of calcium levels in patients with HCINF1, with a good safety profile.

### CYP24A1 as a potential target for cancer therapy.- Jan 2014

Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2014 Jan;14(1):97-108.

Increasing evidence has accumulated to suggest that vitamin D may reduce the risk of cancer through its biologically active metabolite, 1α,25(OH)2D3, which inhibits proliferation and angiogenesis, induces differentiation and apoptosis, and regulates many other cellular functions. Thus, it is plausible to assume that rapid clearance of 1α,25(OH)2D3 by highly expressed CYP24A1 could interrupt the normal physiology of cells and might be one cause of cancer initiation and progression. In fact, enhancement of CYP24A1 expression has been reported in literature for many cancers. Based on these findings, CYP24A1-specific inhibitors and vitamin D analogs which are resistant to CYP24A1-dependent catabolism might be useful for cancer treatment. CYP24A1-specific inhibitor VID400, which is an azole compound, markedly enhanced and prolonged the antiproliferative activity of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the human keratinocytes. Likewise, CYP24A1-resistant analogs such as 2α-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-1α,25(OH)2D3 (O2C3) and its C2-epimer ED-71 (Eldecalcitol), and 19nor- 2α-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1α,25(OH)2D3 (MART-10) showed potent biological effects. Our in vivo studies using rats revealed that MART-10 had a low calcemic effect, which is a suitable property as an anticancer drug. Much lower affinity of MART-10 for vitamin D binding protein (DBP) as compared with 1α,25(OH)2D3 may be related to its more potent cellular activities. 

Based on these results, we conclude that 

* (1) high affinity for VDR, 

* (2) resistance to CYP24A1-dependent catabolism, 

* (3) low affinity for DBP, and 

* (4) low calcemic effect 

may be required for designing potent vitamin D analogs for cancer treatment. PMID: 23869781
