#### [Could a Vitamin D Deficiency Cause Dyslexia?](http://www.ontrackreading.com/dyslexia-puzzle/vitamin-d3-and-dyslexia) Spring 2013

 **Dyslexia is similar to autism** 

* Dyslexia tends to run in families, as does autism.

* Dyslexic children often exhibit developmental delays in motor skills as do autistic children.

* Many of the symptoms of dyslexia overlap the symptoms of ADHD, Asperger's and autism.

* Children diagnosed with ADHD, Asperger's and autism often also struggle with reading

* Increased consumption of fish has been shown to be linked to both autism and reading ability.

* Dyslexia and autism both affect more boys than girls.
