# Summary followed by details

## Adrian Gombart, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, LPI Principal Investigator

from Research Newsletter of Spring 2011 - attached at bottom of this page

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released new dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for calcium and vitamin D on November 30, 2010. The IOM concluded that vitamin D plays a key role in bone health and that current evidence does not support other health benefits from vitamin D supplementation, although the IOM called for additional research targeted at other health outcomes to continue. The changes in the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D were based solely on bone health. The IOM raised the RDA in children (1-18 years) and adults (19-70 years) from 200 IU to 600 IU per day and raised the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults from 2,000 IU to 4,000 IU per day. For the elderly (>70 years), the RDA was increased to 800 IU per day. The majority of vitamin D experts were disappointed by these conservative increases, but they should be considered steps in the right direction.

The IOM also made another very important change. After reviewing the published literature, they concluded that the serum level of vitamin D sufficient for bone health is above 20 ng/ml rather than 30-32 ng/ml, a value that has been used extensively by physicians. During the press conference, they said that it was warranted by the available scientific evidence even though it had not been one of their tasks. By lowering the sufficient level, they, in effect, reduced the number of people that would be considered to have inadequate serum levels of vitamin D. This change will likely cause significant confusion for both physicians and their patients, but it should be noted that it is only relevant to bone health and may not be optimal for other health benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D.

While the new RDA may bring many people into the new sufficient range, a cut-off of 20 ng/ml is controversial in the vitamin D research community because it does not consider other areas of health that the IOM has concluded are not supported by the currently published data.

The IOM is very conservative and based their decisions on a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrate a clear benefit from taking vitamin D supplements beyond bone health, but there is overwhelming evidence that supports biological plausibility for a role of vitamin D in numerous other health outcomes. For example, most non-bone cells have receptors for vitamin D, and we know that the function of immune cells is affected by vitamin D. The IOM narrowly focused on RCTs as the "gold standard"—an almost impossible hurdle to clear when applied to micronutrients. For example, subjects in the placebo group in an RCT will still have some of the micronutrient under evaluation in their bodies—unlike an RCT testing drugs; otherwise, they would get deficiency diseases. While anecdotal reports or single studies seem to be good enough for the IOM to determine the UL, multiple RCTs demonstrating similar outcomes are required for the RDA. Clearly, this is a double standard. DRIs need to take into account the totality of evidence, not just RCTs.

 **LPI continues to recommend a daily intake of 2,000 IU of vitamin D.**  This is well below the UL of 4,000 IU set by the IOM and should ensure that individuals, particularly in areas of the world where sun exposure is limited for extended periods of the year, get enough vitamin D. Also, to adjust for individual differences and ensure adequate body vitamin D status, LPI recommends aiming for a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 80 nmol/l ( **32 ng/ml** ). You can find this information and the recommendations for infants and children in the LPI Micronutrient Information Center section on vitamin D [http ://lpi.oregonstate. edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD](http%20://lpi.oregonstate.%20edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD)

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential

for maintaining normal calcium metabolism <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html">(1)</A>.

Vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> (cholecalciferol) can be synthesized by humans

in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation from

sunlight, or it can be obtained from the diet. Plants synthesize

ergosterol, which is converted to vitamin D<SUB>2</SUB>

(ergocalciferol) by ultraviolet light <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref2">(2)</A>.

When exposure to UVB radiation is insufficient for the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#synthesis">synthesis</A>

of adequate amounts of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> in the skin, adequate

intake of vitamin D from the diet is essential for health.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="function"></A><B>Function</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Activation of Vitamin D</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Vitamin D itself is biologically inactive, and it must

be metabolized to its biologically active forms. After it is consumed

in the diet or synthesized in the epidermis of skin, vitamin D enters

the circulation and is transported to the liver. In the liver,

vitamin D is <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#hydroxylation">hydroxylated</A>

to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol; 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the

major circulating form of vitamin D. Increased exposure to sunlight

or increased dietary intake of vitamin D increases <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#serum">serum</A>

levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, making the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D

concentration a useful indicator of vitamin D nutritional status. In

the kidney, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>-1-hydroxylase <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#enzyme">enzyme</A>

catalyzes a second hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, resulting in

the formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol,

1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D]&mdash;the most potent form of vitamin

D. Most of the physiological effects of vitamin D in the body are

related to the activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref2">(2)</A>.

The various forms of vitamin D are illustrated in the <STRONG><A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/dforms.html">figure</A></STRONG>.</P>

<P><STRONG>Mechanisms of Action </STRONG>

</P>

<P>Most if not all actions of vitamin D are mediated through a

nuclear <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#transcription%20factor">transcription

factor</A> known as the vitamin D receptor (VDR) <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref3">(3)</A>.

Upon entering the nucleus of a cell, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D

associates with the VDR and promotes its association with the

retinoic acid X receptor (RXR). In the presence of

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D the VDR/RXR complex binds small sequences of

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#dna">DNA</A>

known as vitamin D response elements (VDREs) and initiates a cascade

of molecular interactions that modulate the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#transcription">transcription</A>

of specific <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#gene">genes</A>.

More than 50 genes in tissues throughout the body are known to be

regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref4">(4)</A>.</P>

<P><STRONG>Calcium Balance</STRONG></P>

<P>Maintenance of serum calcium levels within a narrow range is vital

for normal functioning of the nervous system, as well as for bone

growth and maintenance of bone density. Vitamin D is essential for

the efficient utilization of calcium by the body <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#reference">(1)</A>.

The <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#parathyroid%20glands">parathyroid

glands</A> sense <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#serum">serum</A>

calcium levels and secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) if calcium

levels drop too low (<STRONG><A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/dendocrine.html">diagram</A></STRONG>).

Elevations in PTH increase the activity of the 25-hydroxyvitamin

D<SUB>3</SUB>-1-hydroxylase <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#enzyme">enzyme</A>

in the kidney, resulting in increased production of

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Increasing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D

production results in changes in <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#gene%20expression">gene

expression</A> that normalize serum calcium by (1) increasing the

intestinal absorption of dietary calcium, (2) increasing the

reabsorption of calcium filtered by the kidneys, and (3) mobilizing

calcium from bone when there is insufficient dietary calcium to

maintain normal serum calcium levels. Parathyroid hormone and

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are required for these latter two effects

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref5">(5)</A>.</P>

<P><B>Cell Differentiation</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Cells that are dividing rapidly are said to be

proliferating. Differentiation results in the specialization of cells

for specific functions. In general, differentiation of cells leads to

a decrease in proliferation. While cellular proliferation is

essential for growth and wound healing, uncontrolled proliferation of

cells with certain <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#mutation">mutations</A>

may lead to diseases like cancer. The active form of vitamin D,

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, inhibits proliferation and stimulates the

differentiation of cells <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html">(1)</A>.

</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="immunity"></A><B>Immunity</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Vitamin D in the form of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is a

potent immune system modulator. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is

expressed by most cells of the immune system, including T cells and

antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref6">(6)</A>.

Under some circumstances, macrophages also produce the

25-hydroxyvitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>-1-hydroxylase enzyme that converts

25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref7">(7)</A>.

There is considerable scientific evidence that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin

D has a variety of effects on immune system function, which may

enhance innate immunity and inhibit the development of <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#autoimmune%20disease">autoimmunity</A>

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref8">(8)</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Insulin Secretion</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The VDR is expressed by <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#insulin">insulin</A>-secreting

cells of the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#pancreas">pancreas</A>,

and the results of animal studies suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin

D plays a role in insulin secretion under conditions of increased

insulin demand <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref9">(9)</A>.

Limited data in humans suggest that insufficient vitamin D levels may

have an adverse effect on insulin secretion and <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#impaired%20glucose%20tolerance">glucose

(noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; NIDDM) <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref10">(10-12)</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Blood Pressure Regulation</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in

the regulation of blood pressure <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref13">(13)</A>.

Renin is an <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#enzyme">enzyme</A>

that <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#catalyze">catalyzes</A>

the cleavage (splitting) of a small <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#peptide">peptide</A>

(Angiotensin I) from a larger protein (angiotensinogen) produced in

the liver. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the cleavage

of angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, a peptide that can increase

blood pressure by inducing the constriction of small arteries and by

increasing sodium and water retention. The rate of angiotensin II

synthesis is dependent on renin <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref14">(14)</A>.

Research in mice lacking the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#gene">gene</A>

encoding the VDR indicates that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreases the

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#gene%20expression">expression</A>

of the gene encoding renin through its interaction with the VDR <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref15">(15)</A>.

Since inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system is

thought to play a role in some forms of human <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#hypertension">hypertension</A>,

adequate vitamin D levels may be important for decreasing the risk of

high blood pressure.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="deficiency"></A><B>Deficiency</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In vitamin D deficiency, calcium absorption cannot be

increased enough to satisfy the body&rsquo;s calcium needs <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref2">(2)</A>.

Consequently, PTH production by the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#parathyroid%20glands">parathyroid

glands</A> is increased and calcium is mobilized from the skeleton to

maintain normal serum calcium levels&mdash;a condition known as

secondary <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#hyperparathyroidism">hyperparathyroidism</A>.

Although it has long been known that severe vitamin D deficiency has

serious consequences for bone health, recent research suggests that

less obvious states of vitamin D deficiency are common and increase

the risk of osteoporosis and other health problems <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref16">(16,

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Severe Vitamin D Deficiency</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG><I>Rickets</I></STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>In infants and children, severe vitamin D deficiency

results in the failure of bone to mineralize. Rapidly growing bones

are most severely affected by rickets. The growth plates of bones

continue to enlarge, but in the absence of adequate mineralization,

weight-bearing limbs (arms and legs) become bowed. In infants,

rickets may result in delayed closure of the fontanels (soft spots)

in the skull, and the rib cage may become deformed due to the pulling

action of the diaphragm. In severe cases, low serum calcium levels

(hypocalcemia) may cause seizures. Although <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#fortification">fortification</A>

of foods has led to complacency regarding vitamin D deficiency,

nutritional rickets is still being reported in cities throughout the

world <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref18">(18,

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Assessing Vitamin D Nutritional Status</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Growing awareness that vitamin D insufficiency has

serious health consequences beyond rickets and osteomalacia

highlights the need for accurate assessment of vitamin D nutritional

status. Although there is general agreement that serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D level is the best indicator of vitamin D

deficiency and sufficiency, the cutoff values have not been clearly

defined <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref18">(18)</A>.

While laboratory reference ranges for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D

levels are often based on average values from populations of healthy

individuals, recent research suggests that health-based cutoff values

aimed at preventing secondary <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#hyperparathyroidism">hyperparathyroidism</A>

and bone loss should be considerably higher. In general, serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D values less than 20-25 nmol/L (8-10 ng/mL)

indicate severe deficiency associated with rickets and osteomalacia

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref16">(16</A>,

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref18">18)</A>.

Although 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) has been suggested as the low end of

the normal range <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref32">(32)</A>,

more recent research suggests that PTH levels <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref33">(33,

34)</A> and calcium absorption <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref35">(35)</A>

are not optimized until serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels reach

approximately 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL). Thus, at least one vitamin D

expert has argued that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D values less than 80

nmol/L should be considered deficient <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref17">(17)</A>,

while another suggests that a healthy serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D value

is between 75 nmol/L and 125 nmol/L (30 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL) <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref36">(36)</A>.

With this latter cutoff value for insufficiency (i.e., 75 nmol/L or

30 ng/mL), it is estimated that one billion people in the world are

currently vitamin D deficient <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref37">(37)</A>.

Data from supplementation studies indicate that vitamin D intakes of

at least 800-1,000 IU/day are required by adults living in temperate

latitudes to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 80

nmol/L <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref38">(38,

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Although <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#osteoporosis">osteoporosis</A>

is a multifactorial disease, vitamin D insufficiency can be an

important contributing factor. A multinational (18 different

countries with latitudes ranging from 64 degrees north to 38 degrees

south) survey of more than 2,600 postmenopausal women with

osteoporosis revealed that 64% of subjects had 25-hydroxyvitamin D

levels lower than 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref44">(44)</A>.

Without sufficient vitamin D from sun exposure or dietary intake,

intestinal calcium absorption cannot be maximized. This causes PTH

secretion by the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#parathyroid%20glands">parathyroid

glands</A>; elevated PTH results in increased bone <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#resorption">resorption</A>,

which may lead to osteoporotic fracture <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref45">(45)</A>.

A <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prospective%20study">prospective

cohort study</A> that followed more than 72,000 postmenopausal women

in the U.S. for 18 years found that those who consumed at least 600

IU/day of vitamin D from diet and supplements had a 37% lower risk of

osteoporotic hip fracture than women who consumed less than 140

IU/day of vitamin D <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref46">(46)</A>.

The results of most clinical trials suggest that vitamin D

supplementation can slow bone density losses or decrease the risk of

osteoporotic fracture in men and women who are unlikely to be getting

enough vitamin D. However, recent analyses indicate that there is a

threshold of vitamin D intake that is necessary to observe reductions

in fracture risk. For instance, a recent meta-analysis of randomized

controlled trials in older adults found that supplementation with 700

to 800 IU vitamin D daily had a 26% and 23% lower risk of hip

fracture and nonvertebral fracture, respectively. In contrast,

supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D daily did not decrease risk

of either hip or nonvertebral fracture <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref47">(47)</A>.

Additionally, recent results from the Women's Health Initiative trial

in 36,282 postmenopausal women showed that daily supplementation with

400 IU of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>, in combination with 1,000 mg

calcium, did not significantly reduce risk of hip fracture compared

to a placebo <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref48">(48)</A>.

Bischoff-Ferrari et al. suggest that daily intakes of greater than

700 IU of vitamin D may be necessary to optimize serum concentrations

of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and thus reduce fracture risk <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref40">(40)</A>.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Support for such a threshold effect of vitamin D on

bone health also comes from previous studies. One study in 247

postmenopausal U.S. women reported that supplementation with 500

mg/day of calcium and either 100 IU/day or 700 IU/day of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>

for two years slowed bone density losses at the hip only in the group

taking 700 IU/day <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref49">(49)</A>.

Another study found that daily supplementation of elderly men and

women with 500 mg/day of calcium and 700 IU/day of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>

for three years reduced bone density losses at the hip and spine and

also reduced the frequency of nonvertebral fractures <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref50">(50)</A>.

A subsequent analysis of this cohort revealed that when the calcium

and vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> supplements were discontinued, the bone

density benefits were lost within two years <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref51">(51)</A>.

Another study found that oral supplementation with 800 IU/day of

vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> and 1,200 mg/day of calcium for three years

decreased the incidence of hip fracture in elderly French women <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref52">(52)</A>.

Further, oral supplementation of elderly adults in the UK with

100,000 IU of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB> once every four months

(equivalent to about 800 IU/day) for five years reduced the risk of

osteoporotic fracture by 33% compared to placebo <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref53">(53)</A>.

However, oral supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>

for more than three years did not affect the incidence of fracture in

a study of elderly Dutch men and women <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref54">(54)</A>.

All of these studies indicate that at least 700 IU of vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>

daily may be required to observe a beneficial effect on fracture

incidence.</P>

<P>However, the Randomised Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D

(RECORD) trial reported that oral supplemental vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>

(800 IU/day) alone, or in combination with calcium (1,000 mg/day),

did not prevent the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures in elderly

adults who had already experienced a low-trauma, osteoporotic

fracture <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref55">(55)</A>.

A lack of an effect could be possibly due to a low compliance in this

study or the fact that vitamin D supplementation did not raise serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to a level that would protect against

fractures <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref40">(40)</A>.

</P>

<P>To date, clinical trials have generally found that vitamin D<SUB>2</SUB>

(ergocalciferol) is not effective at preventing fractures <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref56">(56)</A>.

Overall, the current evidence suggests that vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>

supplements of at least 800 IU/day may be helpful in reducing bone

loss and fracture rates in the elderly. In order for vitamin D

supplementation to be effective in preserving bone health, adequate

dietary calcium (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day) should also be consumed (see

the article on <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/calcium/index.html">Calcium</A>).

increased risk of colon cancer. However, <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prospective%20study">prospective

be associated with significant reductions in risk of colorectal

cancer when other risk factors are taken into account <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref59">(59-62)</A>.

However, some more recent studies have reported that higher vitamin D

intakes and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with

reductions in colorectal cancer risk. One five-year study of more

than 120,000 people found that men with the highest vitamin D intakes

had a risk of colorectal cancer that was 29% lower than men with the

lowest vitamin D intakes <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref63">(63)</A>.

Vitamin D intake in this study was not significantly associated with

colorectal cancer risk in women. Moreover, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D

level, which reflects vitamin D intake and vitamin D synthesis, was

inversely associated with the risk of potentially precancerous

colorectal polyps <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref64">(64)</A>

and indices of colonic epithelial cell proliferation <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref65">(65)</A>,

for colon cancer risk. More recently, a case-control analysis from

the Nurses' Health Study cohort reported that plasma

25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were inversely associated with colorectal

cancer <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref66">(66)</A>.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 36,282

postmenopausal women participating in the Women's Health Initiative

study found that a combination of supplemental vitamin D (400 IU/day)

and calcium (1,000 mg/day) did not lower incidence of colorectal

cancer <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref67">(67)</A>.

However, it has been suggested that the daily vitamin D dose, 400 IU,

was too low to detect any effect on cancer incidence <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref68">(68)</A>.

In fact, a recent dose-response analysis estimated that 1,000 IU of

oral vitamin D daily would lower one's risk of colorectal cancer by

50% <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref69">(69)</A>.

direct evidence of an association between vitamin D nutritional

status and breast cancer risk is limited. A <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prospective%20study">prospective

study</A> of women who participated in the first National Health and

Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) found that several measures

of sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D intake were associated

with a reduced risk of breast cancer 20 years later <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref71">(71)</A>.

More recently, a 16-year study of more than 88,000 women found that

higher intakes of vitamin D were associated with significantly lower

breast cancer risk in premenopausal women but not postmenopausal

women <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref72">(72)</A>.

Garland et al. conducted a pooled, dose-response analysis of two

case-control studies in which women with breast cancer had

significantly lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels compared to

controls <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref73">(73,

74)</A>. These authors reported that women with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D

level of 52 ng/ml (130 nmol/L) experienced a 50% lower risk of

developing breast cancer compared to women with 25-hydroxyvitamin D

levels lower than 13 ng/mL (32.5 nmol/L) <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref75">(75)</A>.

The authors state that to obtain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 52

Increased age is associated with an increased risk of prostate

cancer, as well as with decreased sun exposure and decreased capacity

to synthesize vitamin D. The incidence of prostate cancer is higher

in African American men than in white American men, and the high

melanin content of dark skin is known to reduce the efficiency of

vitamin D synthesis. Geographically, mortality from prostate cancer

is inversely associated with the availability of sunlight. Findings

that prostate cells in culture can synthesize the 25-hydroxyvitamin

D<SUB>3</SUB>-1-hydroxylase <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#enzyme">enzyme</A>

and that, unlike the renal enzyme, its synthesis is not influenced by

PTH or calcium levels also provide support for the idea that

increasing 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may be useful in preventing

prostate cancer <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref76">(76)</A>.

In contrast, prospective studies have not generally found significant

relationships between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and subsequent

risk of developing prostate cancer <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref77">(77-80)</A>.

Although a prospective study of Finnish men found that low serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were associated with earlier and more

aggressive prostate cancer development <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref81">(81)</A>,

another prospective study of men from Finland, Norway and Sweden

found a U-shaped relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D

levels and prostate cancer risk. In that study serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations of 19 nmol/L or lower and 80

nmol/L or higher were associated with higher prostate cancer risk

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref82">(82)</A>.

Further research is needed to determine the nature of the

relationship between vitamin D nutritional status and prostate cancer

risk.</P>

<P>Insulin-dependent <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#diabetes">diabetes</A>

diseases</A>. Autoimmune diseases occur when the body mounts an

immune response against its own tissue, rather than a foreign

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#pathogen">pathogen</A>.

In IDDM, <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#insulin">insulin</A>-producing

beta-cells of the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#pancreas">pancreas</A>

are the target of the inappropriate immune response. In MS, the

targets are the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#myelin">myelin</A>-producing

cells of the central nervous system, and in RA, the targets are the

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#collagen">collagen</A>-producing

cells of the joints <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref83">(83)</A>.

Autoimmune responses are mediated by immune cells called T cells. The

biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has

been found to modulate T cell responses, such that the autoimmune

responses are diminished. <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#epidemiologic%20study">Epidemiological

studies</A> have found that the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prevalence">prevalence</A>

of IDDM, MS, and RA increases as latitude increases, suggesting that

lower exposure to UVB radiation and associated decreases in

endogenous vitamin D synthesis may play a role in the pathology of

these diseases. The results of several <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#prospective%20study">prospective

cohort studies</A> also suggest that adequate vitamin D intake could

possibly decrease the risk of autoimmune diseases. A prospective

cohort study of children born in Finland during the year 1966 and

followed for thirty years found that those who received supplemental

vitamin D during the first year of life had a significantly lower

risk of developing IDDM, while children suspected of developing

rickets (severe vitamin D deficiency) during the first year of life

had a significantly higher risk of developing IDDM <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref84">(84)</A>.

Vitamin D deficiency has also been implicated in MS. A recent

case-control study in U.S. military personnel, including 257 cases of

diagnosed MS, found that white subjects in the highest quintile of

serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (&gt;99.1 nmol/L) had a 62% lower risk of

developing MS <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref85">(85)</A>.

A relationship between this indicator of vitamin D status and MS was

not observed in blacks or Hispanics, but the power to detect such an

association was limited by small sample sizes and overall low serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref85">(85)</A>.

In two large cohorts of U.S. women followed for at least ten years,

vitamin D supplement use was associated with a significant reduction

in the risk of developing MS <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref86">(86)</A>.

Similarly, postmenopausal women with the highest total vitamin D

intakes were at significantly lower risk of developing RA after 11

years of follow-up than those with the lowest intakes <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref87">(87)</A>.

Thus, evidence from both animal model studies and human

epidemiological studies suggests that maintaining sufficient vitamin

D levels could possibly help decrease the risk of several autoimmune

diseases.</P>

<P><A NAME="hypertension"></A><STRONG>Hypertension (High Blood

Pressure)</STRONG></P>

<P>The results of epidemiological and clinical studies suggest an

inverse relationship between serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and

blood pressure, which may be explained by recent findings that

1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreases the <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#gene%20expression">expression</A>

Data from epidemiological studies suggest that conditions that

A controlled clinical trial in 18 hypertensive men and women living

in the Netherlands found that exposure to UVB radiation three times

weekly for six weeks during the winter increased serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and significantly decreased 24-hour

ambulatory <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#systolic%20blood%20pressure">systolic</A>

In <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized

controlled trials</A> of vitamin D supplementation, a combination of

significantly decreased systolic blood pressure in elderly women by

but supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D daily or a single dose

of 100,000 IU of vitamin D did not significantly lower blood pressure

in elderly men and women over a two-month period <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref91">(91,

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Sunlight</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB; wavelengths of 290

in the epidermis of the skin <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref93">(93)</A>.

Sunlight exposure can provide most people with their entire vitamin D

requirement. Children and young adults who spend a short time outside

two or three times a week will generally synthesize all the vitamin D

they need to prevent deficiency. One study reported that serum

vitamin D concentrations following exposure to 1 minimal erythemal

dose of simulated sunlight (the amount required to cause a slight

pinkness of the skin) was equivalent to ingesting approximately

20,000 IU of vitamin D<SUB>2</SUB> <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref94">(94)</A>.

People with dark-colored skin synthesize markedly less vitamin D on

exposure to sunlight than those with light-colored skin <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#reference">(1)</A>.

Additionally, the elderly have diminished capacity to synthesize

vitamin D from sunlight exposure and frequently use sunscreen or

protective clothing in order to prevent skin cancer and sun damage.

The application of sunscreen with an SPF factor of 8 reduces

production of vitamin D by 95%. In latitudes around 40 degrees north

or 40 degrees south (Boston is 42 degrees north), there is

insufficient UVB radiation available for vitamin D synthesis from

November to early March. Ten degrees farther north or south

(Edmonton, Canada) the &ldquo;vitamin D winter&rdquo; extends from

mid-October to mid-March. According to Dr. Michael Holick, as little

as 5-10 minutes of sun exposure on arms and legs or face and arms

three times weekly between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm during the spring,

summer, and fall at 42 degrees latitude should provide a

light-skinned individual with adequate vitamin D and allow for

storage of any excess for use during the winter with minimal risk of

skin damage <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref36">(36)</A>.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Food sources</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Vitamin D is found naturally in very few foods. Foods

containing vitamin D include some fatty fish (mackerel, salmon,

sardines), fish liver oils, and eggs from hens that have been fed

vitamin D. In the U.S., milk and infant formula are fortified with

vitamin D so that they contain 400 IU (10 mcg) per quart. However,

other dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, are not always

fortified with vitamin D. Some cereals and breads are also fortified

with vitamin D. Recently, orange juice fortified with vitamin D has

been made available in the U.S. Accurate estimates of average dietary

intakes of vitamin D are difficult because of the high variability of

the vitamin D content of fortified foods <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref29">(29)</A>.

Vitamin D contents of some vitamin D-rich foods are listed in the

table below in both international units (IU) and micrograms (mcg).

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Supplements</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Most vitamin D supplements available without a

prescription contain cholecalciferol (vitamin D<SUB>3</SUB>).

Multivitamin supplements generally provide 400 IU (10 mcg) of vitamin

D. Single ingredient vitamin D supplements may provide 400 to 2,000

IU of vitamin D, but 400 IU is the most commonly available dose. A

number of calcium supplements may also provide vitamin D.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="safety"></A><B>Safety</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><B>Toxicity</B></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Vitamin D toxicity (hypervitaminosis D) induces

abnormally high <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#serum">serum</A>

calcium levels (hypercalcemia), which could result in bone loss,

kidney stones, and calcification of organs like the heart and kidneys

if untreated over a long period of time. Hypercalcemia has been

observed following daily doses of greater than 50,000 IU of vitamin D

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref37">(37)</A>.

Overall, research suggests that vitamin D toxicity is very unlikely

in healthy people at intake levels lower than 10,000 IU/day <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref38">(38</A>,

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref95">95,

Medicine conservatively set a tolerable upper intake level (<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/glossary.html#ul">UL</A>)

of 4,000 IU/day (100 mcg/day) for all adults (see table below).

Vitamin D toxicity has not been observed to result from sun exposure

<A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref37">(37)</A>.

Certain medical conditions can increase the risk of hypercalcemia in

response to vitamin D, including primary hyperparathyroidism,

sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and lymphoma <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref38">(38)</A>.

People with these conditions may develop hypercalcemia in response to

any increase in vitamin D nutrition and should thus consult a

qualified health care provider regarding any increase in vitamin D

intake.</P>

Institute Recommendation </B>

</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>The Linus Pauling Institute recommends that generally

healthy adults take 2,000 IU (50 mcg) of supplemental vitamin D

daily. Most multivitamins contain 400 IU of vitamin D, and single

ingredient vitamin D supplements are available for additional

supplementation. Sun exposure, diet, skin color, and obesity have

variable, substantial impact on body vitamin D levels. To adjust for

individual differences and ensure adequate body vitamin D status, the

Linus Pauling Institute recommends aiming for a serum

25-hydroxyvitamin D level of at least 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL). Numerous

observational studies have found that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D

levels of 80 nmol/L (32 ng/mL) and above are associated with reduced

risk of bone fractures, several cancers, multiple sclerosis, and type

1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Infants should have a daily intake of 400 to 1,000 IU

(10 to 25 mcg) of vitamin D, and children and adolescents should have

a daily intake of 600 to 1,000 IU (15 to 25 mcg) of vitamin D,

consistent with the recommendations of The Endocrine Society <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref99">(99)</A>.

Given the average vitamin D content of breast milk, infant formula,

and the diets of children and adolescents, supplementation may be

necessary to meet these recommendations. The American Academy of

Pediatrics currently suggests that all infants, children, and

adolescents receive 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily <A HREF="http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/vitamins/vitaminD/drefs.html#ref19">(19)</A>.

</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><STRONG>Older adults (&gt; 50 years)</STRONG></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>Daily supplementation with 2,000 IU (50 mcg) of vitamin

D is especially important for older adults because aging is

associated with a reduced capacity to synthesize vitamin D in the

skin upon sun exposure.</P>
