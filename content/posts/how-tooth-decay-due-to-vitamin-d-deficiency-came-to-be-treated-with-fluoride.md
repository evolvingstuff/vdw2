#### How a Nutritional Deficiency Became Treated with Fluoride

Ignoring evidence on causes of disease such as smoking can harm public health. This report explores how public health experts started to ignore evidence that pediatric vitamin D deficiencies are associated with dental caries. Historical analyses show that an organization of clinical specialists, the American Dental Association (ADA), initiated this view. The ADA was a world-leading organization and its governing bodies worked through political channels to make fluoride a global standard of care for a disease which at the time was viewed as an indicator of vitamin D deficiencies. 

The ADA scientific council was enlisted in this endeavor and authorized the statement saying that “claims for vitamin D as a factor in tooth decay are not acceptable”. 

This statement was ghost-written, the opposite of what the ADA scientific council had endorsed for 15 years, and the opposite of what the National Academy of Sciences concluded.

Internal ADA documents are informative on the origin of this scientific conundrum; the ADA scientific council had ignored their scientific rules and was assisting ADA governing bodies in conflicts with the medical profession on advertising policies. 

The evidence presented here suggests that professional organizations of clinical specialists have the power to create standards of care which ignore key evidence and consequently can harm public health.

#### Press release for the study

 **[How Organized Dentistry Began Treating Vitamin D Deficiency with Fluoride, Researcher Reveals](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/how-organized-dentistry-began-treating-vitamin-d-deficiency-with-fluoride-researcher-reveals-301440299.html)** 

* "After 77 years of water fluoridation, intending to dramatically reduce tooth decay, 70% of US children are fluoride-overdosed, afflicted with dental fluorosis (discolored teeth). Yet, tooth decay is epidemic. Like all drugs, fluoride has adverse side effects."

* ""It did not matter that the professional organization had a  **self-evident conflict of interest** ; topical fluoride applications in dental offices were revenue-generating procedures, vitamin D prescriptions were not," writes Hujoel."

### <span style="color:#00F;">It appears that use of vitamin D to fight COVID is being surpressed as well</span>

 **>$20 billios in profit to use vaccines to fight COVID,   
perhaps 0.1% as much profit to use vitamin D to fight COVID** 

 **Suspect that Topical Floiride was patented for teeth in the 1930s, when the ADA was encouraged to use it  
Follow the money - more income to dentists, more profit for suppliers**
