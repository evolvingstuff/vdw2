#### RCT 2012 - lots of benefit, also observed 1/2 degree  temperature rise

Objectives: To estimate the effects of low level laser therapy in combination with a programme of exercises on pain, functionality, range of motion, muscular strength and quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with sequential allocation of patients to different treatment groups.

Setting: Special Rehabilitation Services.

Subjects: Forty participants with knee osteoarthritis, 2–4 osteoarthritis degree, aged between 50 and 75 years and both genders.

Intervention: Participants were randomized into one of two groups: the laser group (low level laser therapy dose of 3 J and exercises) or placebo group (placebo laser and exercises).

Main measures: Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), functionality using the Lequesne questionnaire, range of motion with a universal goniometer, muscular strength using a dynamometer, and activity using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) questionnaire at three time points: (T1) baseline, (T2) after the end of laser therapy (three weeks) and (T3) the end of the exercises (11 weeks).

Results: When comparing groups, significant differences in the activity were also found (P = 0.03). No other significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed in other variables. In intragroup analysis, participants in the laser group had significant improvement, relative to baseline, on

* pain (P = 0.001), 

* range of motion (P = 0.01), 

* functionality (P = 0.001) and 

* activity (P < 0.001). 

No significant improvement was seen in the placebo group.

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low level laser therapy when associated with exercises is effective in yielding pain relief, function and activity on patients with osteoarthritis of the knees.

#### RCT March 2014 high intensity and exercise

 **High-intensity versus low-level laser therapy in the treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized controlled trial** 

Lasers in Medical Science, July 2014, V 29, # 4, pp 1371–1376, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10103-014-1529-0

The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) on pain relief and functional improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). A total of 53 male patients participated in this study, with a mean (SD) age of 54.6 (8.49) years. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups and treated with HILT and exercise (HILT + EX), LLLT and exercise (LLLT + EX), and placebo laser plus exercise (PL + EX) in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The outcomes measured were pain level measured by visual analog scale (VAS) and knee function measured by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Statistical analyses were performed to compare the differences between baseline and posttreatment measurements. The level of statistical significance was set as P < 0.05. The result showed that HILT and LLLT combined with exercise were effective treatment modalities in decreasing the VAS and WOMAC scores after 6 weeks of treatment. HILT combined with exercises was more effective than LLLT combined with exercises, and both treatment modalities were better than exercises alone in the treatment of patients with KOA.

BACKGROUND: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent, chronic disorder with excessive functional, social and economic burdens. The goal of treatment is to alleviate the symptoms and slow the progression. Documenting the effects of exercise and LLLT as co-modalities in the management of KOA allows practitioners to implement this management tool as part of KOA rehabilitation, resulting in the earlier discharge from a supervised rehabilitation setting

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 111 participants (aged between 40-75 years) diagnosed with KOA. Participants were randomised into an exercise (n=39), LLLT (n=40), or a combined exercise-LLLT (n=32) group

METHODS: The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scale was used to assess pain and functionality. Knee range of motion was assessed using a goniometer, and the one-minute timed sit-to-stand test measured physical functionality at four time points: (T1) baseline, (T2) post 12-session intervention, (T3) one-month post intervention and (T4) three-month's post intervention. Knee circumference was measured using a measuring tape

RESULTS: WOMAC pain and functionality scale and knee circumference scores decreased in all three groups (P<0.05), but the combined exercise-LLLT group demonstrated better outcomes than the LLLT or exercise alone groups respectively. The combined exercise-LLLT group showed better acute and long-term benefits with participants experiencing a 3.5 centimetre decrease in knee circumference, 24 point improvement in the WOMAC pain and functionality scale, and a four repetition increase in physical functionality

CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that LLLT is a viable tool for managing KOA when used in conjunction with physical exercise

#### Meta-analysis Sept 2015: 9 studies with continuous illumination found no benefit   
- - they chose to not analyze the hundreds of studies which used modulated light

 **Effectiveness of low-level laser therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis** 

Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, Vol 23, Issue 9, Sept 2015, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2015.04.005 

Huang J.Chen§aJ.Ma .Shen.Pei†V.B.Kraus

 **Note: There are a huge number of ways of modulating an LLLT  
 It appears that the benefit is proportional to the number of times the LLLT is turned on and off  
It is virtually impossible to compare benefit of different modulations, so the meta-analysis ignored them  
Also: Using very short pulses allows 100X stronger light intensity, which results in greater penetration depth** 

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) by a systematic literature search with meta-analyses on selected studies.

Design

MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Library were systematically searched from January 2000 to November 2014. Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) written in English that compared LLLT (at least eight treatment sessions) with sham laser in KOA patients. The efficacy effective size was estimated by the standardized mean difference (SMD). Standard fixed or random-effects meta-analysis was used, and inconsistency was evaluated by the I-squared index (I2).

Results

Of 612 studies, **nine RCTs**  (seven double-blind, two single-blind, totaling 518 patients) met the criteria for inclusion. Based on seven studies, the SMD in visual analog scale (VAS) pain score right after therapy (RAT) (within 2 weeks after the therapy) was not significantly different between LLLT and control (SMD = −0.28 <span>[95% CI = −0.66, 0.10]</span>, I2 = 66%). No significant difference was identified in studies conforming to the World Association of Laser Therapy (WALT) recommendations (four studies) or on the basis of OA severity. There was no significant difference in the delayed response (12 weeks after end of therapy) between LLLT and control in VAS pain (five studies). Similarly, there was no evidence of LLLT effectiveness based on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, stiffness or function outcomes (five and three studies had outcome data right after and 12 weeks after therapy respectively).

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that the best available current evidence does not support the effectiveness of LLLT as a therapy for patients with KOA.
