BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D deficiency and a high mean platelet volume (MPV) are related to cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with high MPV.

METHODS:

This study included 434 patients without chronic disease who were not taking vitamin D or calcium supplements. Vitamin D was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay on the Architect-I2000 system (Abbott Diagnostics, USA), and MPV was measured on the Cell-Dyn Ruby analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics). Patients were divided into Groups 1 (138 [men/women, 46/92](men/women,%2046/92)), 2 (148 [men/women, 54/94](men/women,%2054/94)), and 3 (148 [men/women, 50/98](men/women,%2050/98)) according to vitamin D levels of <10 ng/mL, 10-20 ng/mL, and >20 ng/mL, respectively.

RESULTS:

The vitamin D level in Group 1 (7.7±1.9 ng/mL) was lower than that in Group 2 (15.1±1.6 ng/mL, P<0.001) and Group 3 (25.6±6.3 ng/mL, P<0.001). The MPV in Group 3 (7.5±1.0 fL) was lower than that in Group 1 (8.1±1.1 fL, P<0.001) and Group 2 (7.9±1.0 fL, P=0.009). Linear regression analysis showed that low levels of vitamin D (β=-0.109, P=0.019) was independently associated with increased MPV.

CONCLUSIONS:

There was a strong association between a low vitamin D level and a high MPV; therefore, vitamin D deficiency may be associated with increased MPV.

> In medicine, mean platelet volume (MPV) is a measurement that describes the average size of platelets in the blood. Platelets are not true cells, although they are often referred to as such. Like red blood cells, they are formed in the bone marrow, but are much smaller, and are involved in the clotting of blood, helping to stop bleeding in event of injury. An MPV may be carried out as part of a complete blood count (CBC). The importance of mean platelet volume lies in the fact that it provides an indicator as to whether the bone marrow is manufacturing them normally.

* [What Are the Dangers of Large Platelets?](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-dangers-of-large-platelets.htm) wiseGEEK, Clip follows

> The most common problem experienced by people with large platelets is increased bleeding. The oversized platelets cannot clot properly and as a result, the patient may bleed freely from even small injuries, develop substantial bruising, and experience internal bleeding that is difficult to stop because the blood does not clot. This can become very dangerous if the bleeding is excessive and when it occurs internally, the patient may not be aware of it until substantial blood loss has occurred.

* [Mean platelet volume: a link between thrombosis and inflammation?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21247392) 2011

> Clip – Established cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, can influence MPV, depending on confounding factors. Low-grade inflammation is one such factor. Evidence, particularly derived from prospective studies and a meta-analysis, suggest a correlation between an increase in MPV and the risk of thrombosis.
