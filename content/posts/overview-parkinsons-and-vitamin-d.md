#### Vitamin D Deficiency-Induced Vertebral Fractures May Cause <span style="color:#F00;">Stooped Posture</span> in Parkinson Disease - 2011

American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation:

April 2011 - Volume 90 - Issue 4 - pp 281-286

Sato, Yoshihiro MD; Iwamoto, Jun MD; Honda, Yoshiaki MD

Results: During the 5-yr study period, stooped posture developed in 34 patients; the rest of the 58 patients did not show stooped posture. At baseline, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels were 10.9 ng/ml and 73.1 pg/ml, respectively, in the stooped group and 18.6 ng/ml and 56.4 pg/ml, respectively, in the nonstooped group. Bone mineral density in the stooped group was significantly lower than in the nonstooped group. Dietary intake of vitamin D in the stooped group was significantly lower than in the nonstooped group. 

During the study period, 19 (22%) patients in the nonstooped group developed new vertebral fracture, compared with 23 (100%) patients in the stooped group. 

The mean ± SD percentage changes in bone mineral density were ?6.5 ± 0.6 in the stooped group and ?3.8 ± 0.8 in the nonstooped group. 

Mean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D after 5 yrs were  **7.0 ng/ml in the stooped group**  and 14.1 ng/ml in the nonstooped group.

Conclusions: Stooped posture in Parkinson disease may be caused by  **vertebral fractures**  resulting from vitamin D deficiency with compensatory hyperparathyroidism. 

Vitamin D supplementation may reduce stooped posture in patients with Parkinson disease.

* "[Research done by Dr. Carlie Tanner and Dr. Sam Goldman about a decade ago](https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.22629) showed that in twins who were exposed to this through their work (it’s widely used as a degreasing agent) or hobbies (it’s used in printing and painting, by varnish workers, or by anyone that needs it as a solvent) had a 500% increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Importantly, in that study, they showed that there was a lag time of 10-40 years between exposure to that chemical and the diagnosis of the disease."
