#### Rheumatoid arthritis 40% more likely if poor Vitamin D Receptor – meta-analysis - Feb 2017

 **Association between Vitamin D Receptor polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis risk: a meta-analysis**

The aim of this study was to identify whether vitamin D receptor (VDR) variants were implicated in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. Relevant case-control studies published between 2000 and 2016 were searched in electronic databases. Odds ratio (OR) with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed to calculate extracted data. Total fourteen studies were screened out, including 2359 patients and 2764 controls, and focusing on four genetic variants (TaqI, BsmI, FokI and Apal). Our results found that T allele of TaqI (T vs. t:  **OR=1.40** , 95% CI=1.08-1.82, P=0.01), B allele of BsmI (B vs. b: OR=0.84, 95% CI=0.75-0.94, P=0.003), and F allele of FokI (F vs. f: OR=1.2495% CI=1.05-1.47, P=0.01) polymorphisms were associated with increased the risk of RA in total populations. This significant association was also found in TT genotype of TaqI, BB genotype and Bb genotyps of BsmI, and FF and Ff genotypes of FokI. Subgroup analysis found that BsmI variant among Africans, FokI variant among Asians and Caucasians were significantly increased the risk of RA. No relationship was found between ApaI variant and Ra risk. Our results demonstrated that polymorphisms of TaqI, BsmI, FokI, not ApaI in VDR gene might be involved in the development of RA.

#### Rheumatoid arthritis 40% more likely if poor Vitamin D Receptor – meta-analysis - June 2015

 **Association between VDR polymorphisms and rheumatoid arthritis disease: Systematic review and updated meta-analysis of case–control studies** 

Immunobiology, Volume 220, Issue 6, June 2015, Pages 807–816, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2014.12.013

Background: Vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms have been inconsistently investigated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, published studies demonstrated differences concerning design and effect size. A meta-analysis is necessary to determine the magnitude of the association between VDR polymorphisms and RA risk.

Objective: The aim of the current study was to quantify the magnitude of the association between TaqI, BsmI, and FokI VDR polymorphisms with RA risk.

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic search and meta-analysis of the literature were conducted. Analyses were performed in the random effects model by using recessive, dominant, codominant, homozygous, and allele contrast models.

Results

A total of 1703 cases and 2635 controls in 12 case–control studies were included in the meta-analyses. Results indicated a significant association between TaqI polymorphism and RA disease in homozygous, codominant and allele contrast models (P = 0.008, P = 0.015, P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively). Association between BsmI polymorphism and RA risk was marginal in the dominant, codominant and allele contrast models (P = 0.057, P = 0.071, and P = 0.069, respectively). Te association between FokI polymorphism and RA risk was significant in the recessive, dominant and allele contrast models (P = 0.045, P = 0.027, and P = 0.013, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that publication year, ethnicity, age, latitude, and estimated 25(OH)D levels influenced significantly the association between VDR polymorphisms and RA risk.

Conclusion: TaqI and FokI VDR polymorphisms contributed significantly to RA risk. Study characteristics influenced the association between VDR polymorphisms and RA disease.

#### Vitamin D receptor Fok, BsmI, and TaqI polymorphisms and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis – A meta-analysis - Sept 2015

Journal of Rheumatology. First online: 12 September 2015

Objective: The aim of this study to explore what Whether vitamin D receptor ( **VDR** ) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods: Meta-analyzes were Conducted on the associations between the VDR FokI, BsmI, and TaqI polymorphisms and RA.

Results

A total of seven studies were Considered in the meta-analysis, Involving a total of 923 patients and 912 controls. Meta-analysis of the  **VDR**  FokI polymorphism Showed no association between RA and the F alleles in the Entire of studied cohort (odds ratio, OR = 1.1740 95% confidence interval, CI = 0994-1387, p  = 0.059). 

HOWEVER, stratification by ethnicity revealed a significant association between the  **F allele and RA in Europeans (OR = 1.402** , 95% CI = 1126-1746, p  = 0.003). Further More, at what association found between RA and the VDR FokI polymorphism using Both the dominant model and homozygous contrast. 

Meta-analysis revealed no association between RA and the VDR BsmI B and TaqI T polymorphisms in Europeans (OR Hanes B alleles = 1.065, 95% CI = 0911-1245, p  = 0.427; OR = 1.065 for the T allele, 95% CI = 0834-1361, p  = 0.613).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis Suggests That the VDR FokI polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to RA in European populations.
