* Intramuscular injection of 0.5 mg/kg progesterone twice daily 

* 5Âµg/kg oral vitamin D3 twice daily up to 5 days

> = 32,000 IU daily for 80 kg (176 lbs) person (400 IU/day/kg) = total of 160,000 IU

> &nbsp; &nbsp; many other vitamin D studies use loading doses of 300,000 to 800,000 IU

> &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the study participants might have achieved a useful level of vitamin D by day 5

A single loading dose of Vitamin D would have resulted in good level in 3  rather than 5 days
