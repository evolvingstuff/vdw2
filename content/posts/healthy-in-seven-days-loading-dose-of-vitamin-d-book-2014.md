 **<span style="color:#00F;">Note:  Start with 400,000 IU of vitamin D to restore levels quickly  to 50 ng and continue with maintenance of 3,333 IU average </span>** 

* Initially 400 pills of 1,000 IU  in a few days to weeks (recall that Germany restricts over-the-counter Vitamin D dose to 1,000 IU)

* Maintenance (not in Germany) would require only [One pill every two weeks](/posts/one-pill-every-two-weeks-gives-you-all-the-vitamin-d-most-adults-need)

 **Assumptions:** 

* 1. Body weight: 70 kg (154 lb).

* 2. Vitamin D level increased by 1 ng/ml with a one-off dose of 10,000 units.

* 3. No vitamin D gained through UVB radiation on the skin.

* 4. Vitamin D level drops by 20 percent a month

* 5. Initial value: 10 ng/ml. 

* 6. Target value: 50 ng/ml.

### Normal, natural, optimum vitamin D levels

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Toxic effect | over 300 ng/ml |
| Risk of excessively high calcium | over 150 ng/ml |
| Recommended upper limit in the blood | 100 ng/ml |
| Level with regular sunbathing | 50 to 90 ng/ml |
|  **Optimal**  (minimum risk of illness) |  **50 to 90**  ng/ml |
| Good (low susceptibility to illness) | over 40 ng/ml |
| Satisfactory (good calcium intake) | over 30 ng/ml |
| Deficiency (risk of osteoporosis in old age) | under 30 ng/ml |

The standard baby doses of 400 or 800 units will do nothing. 

This dose for infants with a body weight of three kilograms was purely aimed at preventing rickets. 

Adults' requirements are much greater.

 **Formulae for calculating doses for the initial and ongoing treatment.** 

The incremental factor and loss rate are average values, and vary in individual cases.

 **Short formula for initial treatment**  (capsules with 5,000 units): 

Number of capsules = Desired increase x body weight x 0.028

Example: 40 ng/ml x 100 kg x 0.028 = 112 capsules initially

 **Short formula for maintenance treatment**  (capsules per month): 

Number of capsules = Target value x body weight <span>[kg]</span> x 0.0056

Example: 50 ng/mlx 68 kgx 0.0056 = 19 capsules

 **In Germany, all pre-formed vitamin D medications containing more than 1,000 units require a prescription** . 

But this is a mistaken preventive measure. 

French pharmacies have for years been selling drinkable 200,000-unit ampoules on prescription for less than 2 Euros without any problems.

The MANOS  concept   (Muscles , Adynamia, Nervous  system , Orthostasis , Skeletal damage)  covers  the  main   symptoms  of   acute vitamin   D  deficiency .

&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: Adynamic  disorders :   Debility ,  listlessness,  lack   of   energy ,  permanent   exhaustion   and  constant fatigue.

He was a doctor for 20 years, then discovered Vitamin D

He comments in the introduction that animals get much higher vitamin D supplementation than Germans

(VitaminDWiki notes that vets around the world give animals a good level of vitamin D because vets are typically paid to keep their patients healthy, vs doctors are typically only paid when the patient is not healthy)  see [Overview Veterinary and vitamin D](/posts/overview-veterinary-and-vitamin-d)

 **Hippocrates himself recommended daily  sun bathing.**
