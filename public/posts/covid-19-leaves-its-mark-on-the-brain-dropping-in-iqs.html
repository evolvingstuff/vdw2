#### Mounting research shows that COVID-19 leaves its mark on the brain, including with significant drops in IQ scores

 **[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/mounting-research-shows-that-covid-19-leaves-its-mark-on-the-brain-including-with-significant-drops-in-iq-scores-224216)  excellent article** 

* &quot;To put the finding of the New England Journal of Medicine study into perspective, I estimate that a three-point downward shift in IQ would increase the number of U.S. adults with an IQ less than 70 from 4.7 million to 7.5 million – an increase of 2.8 million adults with a level of cognitive impairment that requires significant societal support.&quot;

* &quot;A recent analysis of the U.S. Current Population Survey showed that after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional  **1 million working-age Americans**  reported having “serious difficulty” remembering, concentrating or making decisions than at any time in the preceding 15 years. Most disconcertingly, this was mostly driven by younger adults between the ages of 18 to 44.&quot;
