Clinical studies show that chronic diseases and infections can be prevented by proactively correcting vitamin D deficiency in individuals who are vitamin D deficient, and in the community. In RCTs, with proper daily or once-a-week vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group, the serum 25(OH)D concentration must be meaningfully increased to the above pre-planned level to ensure the validity of the clinical study. Clinical outcomes correlate well with the serum 25(OH)D concentrations but not necessarily with the administered doses. It is a common error by researchers and healthcare workers to assume that the amount taken automatically produces the stipulated serum levels.</p><p>38601 Nov 2023</p><p><strong>Sections include:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Vitamin D is a Threshold Nutrient</p></li><li><p>Adverse Effects of Vitamin D are Rare</p></li><li><p>A Small number of People Require High Doses to Alleviate Intractable Symptoms</p></li><li><p>Diagnosing Vitamin D-Related Toxicity</p></li><li><p>Personal Vitamin D Response and Targeted Serum 25(OH)D Concentrations</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D Deficiency Increases Vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 Infections</p></li><li><p>Issues with Published RCTs and Limitations of Data and Interpretation</p></li><li><p>New Vitamin D Recommendations</p></li></ul><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/vitamin-d-practical-considerations-and-clinical-guidance-sunil.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d>Vitamin D</h5><p>Vitamin D is a micronutrient with pleiotropic effects in humans. Due to sedentary lifestyles and increasing time spent indoors, a growing body of research is revealing that vitamin D deficiency is a global problem. Despite the routine measurement of vitamin D in clinical laboratories and many years of efforts, methods of vitamin D analysis have yet to be standardized and are burdened with significant difficulties.</p><p>78907 Jun 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-fortification>Vitamin D Fortification</h5><p>By utilizing historical changes in Danish legislation related to mandatory vitamin D fortification of margarine, which was implemented in the mid 1930s and abruptly abandoned in June 1985, the studies in the D-tect project investigated the effects of vitamin D on health outcomes in individuals, who during gestation were exposed or unexposed to extra vitamin D from fortified margarine.</p><p>47130 Aug 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-preeclampsia>Vitamin D and Preeclampsia</h5><p>Preeclampsia (PE) is a set of clinical symptoms that appears after the 20th week of pregnancy. It is a multi-organ disease characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, and in the absence of proteinuria—an impairment of the functions of the internal organs. With regard to the multiple mechanisms of action of Vit D, its deficiency seems to be one of the possible factors conducive to PE development. It has been suggested that the consequence of low Vit D levels may be the appearance of an early, severe form of PE, and its supplementation may be a protective factor against its recurrence in subsequent pregnancies <sup>[232]</sup>. The relationship between Vit D and PE development may explain its impact on implantation, angiogenesis, and endothelial status, regulation of the immune response, effect on RAAS, and calcium metabolism.</p><p>39617 Nov 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-dependent-rickets>Vitamin D-dependent Rickets</h5><p>Vitamin D-dependent rickets is a disorder of bone development that leads to softening and weakening of the bones (rickets).</p><p>82023 Dec 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-infertility>Vitamin D and Infertility</h5><p>Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis, by increasing intestinal calcium absorption and renal calcium reabsorption. For vitamin D, accumulating evidence from observational human studies suggests a key role for both male and female fertility.</p><p>39803 Sep 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-glomerulonephritis>Vitamin D and Glomerulonephritis</h5><p>Vitamin D presents a plethora of different functions that go beyond its role in skeletal homeo-stasis. It is an efficient endocrine regulator of the Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System (RAAS) and erythropoiesis, exerts immunomodulatory effects, reduces the cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients, Vitamin D function is im-paired; the renal hydrolyzation of its inactive form by the action of 1α-hydroxylase declines at the same pace of reduced nephron mass. Moreover, Vitamin D major carrier, the D-binding pro-tein (DBP), is less represented due to Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), proteinuria, and the alteration of the cubilin–megalin–amnionless receptor complex in the renal proximal tubule. In Glomeru-lonephritis (GN), Vitamin D supplementation demonstrated to significantly reduce proteinuria and to slow kidney disease progression. It also has potent antiproliferative and immunomodu-lating functions, contributing to the inhibitions of kidney inflammation. Vitamin D preserves the structural integrity of the slit diaphragm guaranteeing protective effects on podocytes. Acti-vated Vitamin D has been demonstrated to potentiate the antiproteinuric effect of RAAS inhibi-tors in IgA nephropathy and Lupus Nephritis, enforcing its role in the treatment of glomerulo-nephritis: calcitriol treatment, through Vitamin D receptor (VDR) action, can regulate the hepa-ranase promoter activity and modulate the urokinase receptor (uPAR), guaranteeing podocyte preservation. It also controls the podocyte distribution by modulating mRNA synthesis and protein expression of nephrin and podocin. Maxalcalcitol is another promising alternative: it has about 1/600 affinity to vitamin D binding protein (DBP), compared to Calcitriol, overcoming the risk of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and calcifications, and it circulates principally in un-bound form with easier availability for target tissues. Doxercalciferol, as well as paricalcitol, showed a lower incidence of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria than Calcitriol. Paricalcitol demonstrated a significant role in suppressing RAAS genes expression: it significantly decreases angiotensinogen, renin, renin receptors, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA levels, thus reducing proteinuria and renal damage.</p><p>62411 Oct 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-deficiency>Vitamin D Deficiency</h5><p>Vitamin D was found to counteract insulin resistance via participation in the maintenance of normal resting reactive oxygen species level and regulation of Ca2+ level in many cell types.</p><p>Both genomic and non-genomic action of vitamin D is directed to insulin signaling. Thereby, vitamin D reduces the extent of pathologies associated with insulin resistance such as oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, the beneficial actions of vitamin D include an improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-sensitive tissues, and in consequence the diminish of insulin resistance.</p><p>89930 Sep 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-signaling>Vitamin D Signaling</h5><p>The vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is the natural, high-affinity ligand of the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR). In many tissues and cell types, VDR binds in a ligand-dependent fashion to thousands of genomic loci and modulates, via local chromatin changes, the expression of hundreds of primary target genes. Thus, the epigenome and transcriptome of VDR-expressing cells is directly affected by vitamin D. Vitamin D target genes encode for proteins with a large variety of physiological functions, ranging from the control of calcium homeostasis, innate and adaptive immunity, to cellular differentiation.</p><p>43312 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-fortified-beverages>Vitamin D-Fortified Beverages</h5><p>Vitamin D is a lipophilic bioactive that plays an important role in bone health. Fortification of beverages, such as milk, fruit juices, teas, and vegetable drinks, could be an efficient strategy to prevent vitamin D deficiency and its associated effects on health.</p><p>111728 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=oral-vitamin-d-therapy>Oral Vitamin D Therapy</h5><p>Vitamin D is an essential nutrient in humans; it is produced by the body through exposure to the sun (the primary source of vitamin D), or more precisely, to mild ultraviolet B (UVB) light.</p><p>42709 Aug 2021</p><p>Topic Review</p><p>Vitamin D in NF1</p><p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone playing a pivotal role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis as well as in bone health. Several investigations indicated that vitamin D action extends far beyond bone health and calcium metabolism, showing broad effects on a variety of critical illnesses, including cancer, infections, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Epidemiological studies indicated that low circulating vitamin D levels inversely correlate with cutaneous manifestations and bone abnormalities, clinical hallmarks of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is an autosomal dominant tumour predisposition syndrome causing significant pain and morbidity, for which limited treatment options are available.</p><p>72729 Jan 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-cancer>Vitamin D and Cancer</h5><p>There is strong evidence from geographical ecological and observational studies that solar UVB exposure and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration are inversely correlated with risk of incidence and death from many types of cancer. Clinical trials have provided limited support for the UVB-vitamin D-cancer hypothesis due to poor design and execution. Many experimental studies in cultured cells and animal models have described a wide range of anticancer effects of vitamin D compounds.</p><p>36127 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-microbiota>Vitamin D and Microbiota</h5><p>Microbiome studies have already demonstrated unique microbial patterns in systemic autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Dysbiosis also seems to be associated with allergies, in particular asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy.</p><p>24528 Oct 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-target-genes>Vitamin D Target Genes</h5><p>The biologically active form of vitamin D3, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), modulates innate and adaptive immunity via genes regulated by the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR). In order to identify the key vitamin D target genes involved in these processes, transcriptome-wide datasets were compared, which were obtained from a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated in vitro by 1,25(OH)2D3, filtered using different approaches, as well as from PBMCs of individuals supplemented with a vitamin D3 bolus. The led to the genes ACVRL1, CAMP, CD14, CD93, CEBPB, FN1, MAPK13, NINJ1, LILRB4, LRRC25, SEMA6B, SRGN, THBD, THEMIS2 and TREM1. Public epigenome- and transcriptome-wide data from THP-1 cells were used to characterize these genes based on the level of their VDR-driven enhancers as well as the level of the dynamics of their mRNA production.</p><p>65715 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-on-immune-system>Vitamin D on Immune System</h5><p>Vitamin D deficiency, which causes an imbalance in bone remodeling, is a global public health problem and its frequency is increasing.</p><p>39006 Dec 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-on-skin-aging>Vitamin D on Skin Aging</h5><p>The normal vitamin D3 status is important for a general prevention of premature aging maintaining a healthful skin aging. Vitamin D3metabolites including its classical (1,25(OH)2D3) and novel (CYP11A1-intitated) D3hydroxyderivatives exert many beneficial protective effects on the skin, which could influence the process of premature aging via many different mechanisms, leading to a delay or attenuation of both chronological skin aging and photoaging. Skin-resident cells (keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and sebocytes) are capable of locally activating vitamin D3and exhibiting a diverse biological effect such as photoprotection and immunosuppression, similar to the UVR-induced one.</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-brain-health>Vitamin D in Brain Health</h5><p>In the present review a novel role of vitamin D has been described during aging condition, focusing on vitamin D mechanism in brain and how it can help slow down diseases related to neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. In particular vitamin D metabolism and the role of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in brain was underlained. Despite the important role of vitamin D in this context, we discussed the potential effects of curcumin on the health of the central nervous system. Finally we focused on possible treatments triggered by vitamin D and curcumin, especially in neuroprotection and maintaining brain health.</p><p>64327 Oct 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-metabolism-gene-polymorphisms>Vitamin D Metabolism Gene Polymorphisms</h5><p>Vitamin D is a potent immunonutrient that through its main metabolite calcitriol, regulates the immunomodulation of macrophages, dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes, which express the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and they produce and respond to calcitriol. Genetic association studies have shown that up to 65% of vitamin D serum variance may be explained due to genetic background.</p><p>178201 Jan 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-deficiency-and-t2dm>Vitamin D Deficiency and T2DM</h5><p>It seems that vitamin D deficiency may be one of the crucial factors responsible for increased cancer risk among T2DM patients. Vitamin D via alleviation of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and inflammation reduces diabetes driven cancer risk factors. Moreover, vitamin D strengthens the DNA repair process, and regulates apoptosis and autophagy of cancer cells as well as signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis i.e., tumor growth factor β (TGFβ), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Wnt-β-Cathenin. It should also be underlined that many types of cancer cells present alterations in vitamin D metabolism and action as a result of Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1 expression dysregulation.</p><p>34822 Jul 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-arrests-cell-cycling>Vitamin D arrests cell cycling</h5><p>Vitamin D is a steroid hormone crucial for bone mineral metabolism. In addition, vitamin D has pleiotropic actions in the body, including anti-cancer actions. These anti-cancer properties observed within in vitro studies frequently report the reduction of cell proliferation by direct alteration of cell cycle regulators which induce cell cycle arrest. The most recurrent reported mode of cell cycle arrest by vitamin D is at the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle. This arrest is mediated by p21 and p27 upregulation, which results in suppression of cyclin D and E activity which leads to G1/G0 arrest. In addition, vitamin D treatments within in vitro cell lines have observed a reduced C-MYC expression and increased retinoblastoma protein levels that also result in G1/G0 arrest.</p><p>70616 Dec 2020</p><hr><h5 id=oral-vitamin-d-therapy-1>Oral Vitamin D Therapy</h5><p>Vitamin D is an essential nutrient in humans; it is produced by the body through exposure to the sun (the primary source of vitamin D), or more precisely, to mild ultraviolet B (UVB) light.</p><p>42709 Aug 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-nf1--neurofibromatosis>Vitamin D in NF1 ( neurofibromatosis)</h5><p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone playing a pivotal role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis as well as in bone health.

Both diseases are associated with microbiota dysbiosis, with a reduced population of butyrate-producing species, abnormal inflammatory response, and micronutrient deficiency (e.g., vitamin D hypovitaminosis). Vitamin D (VitD) is involved in immune cell differentiation, gut microbiota modulation, gene transcription, and barrier integrity. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulates the biological actions of the active VitD (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), and is involved in the genetic, environmental, immune, and microbial aspects of IBD. VitD deficiency is correlated with disease activity and its administration targeting a concentration of 30 ng/mL may have the potential to reduce disease activity. Moreover, VDR regulates functions of T cells and Paneth cells and modulates release of antimicrobial peptides in gut microbiota-host interactions. Meanwhile, beneficial microbial metabolites, e.g., butyrate, upregulate the VDR signaling.</p><p>59331 Jan 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-dairy-products>Vitamin D in Dairy Products</h5><p>The term Vitamin D was created in 1922, describing a vitamin able to promote calcium deposition.

However, VD insufficiency is observed in infants all over the world. Low VD concentration in the breast milk of non-supplemented mothers and low compliance to VD daily supplementation are the main causes of VD insufficiency, especially in the long term. Furthermore, VD supplementation dosages are still debated and differ by country. Different dosages and supplementation strategies result in similar VD sufficiency rates. Therefore, international guidelines may be revised in the future to offer multiple and different options of supplementation for specific settings and ages.</p><p>31920 Jun 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-cognitive-dysfunction>Vitamin D in Cognitive Dysfunction</h5><p>Vitamin D is necessary for all vertebrates, including humans, to maintain adequate phosphate and calcium levels in the blood, thereby helping to develop normal bone, optimal maintenance of muscle contractions, and cellular functions in different parts of the body.

In addition, in vitro, animal, and human studies have revealed several mechanisms that may relate VDD to ED. The main mechanism by which vitamin D might exert its action on sexual function appears to be through the regulation of endothelial function. Indeed, VDD correlates with several markers of endothelial function. The action of vitamin D on the endothelium would be exercised both indirectly through its intervention in inflammatory processes and through the production of oxygen free radicals, and directly through the regulation of vascular stiffness, the production of nitric oxide, and the regulation of vessel permeability.</p><p>13525 Jun 2023</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-sleep-disorders>Vitamin D in Sleep Disorders</h5><p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, mainly synthesized in the body through ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure on the skin or taken orally through food and/or supplements.</p><p>41311 Feb 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-infectious-diseases>Vitamin D and Infectious Diseases</h5><p>It is now 2 years since we have seen the impact of the CoronaVirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 worldwide, affecting millions of people and rates of mortality close to 6 million. Although we are beginning to see the real benefit of vaccines, in terms of reduced mortality rates, many individuals still remain to be vaccinated or do not respond to them leaving a large number of patients still experiencing severe respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19. In recent months, we have seen another surge in individuals infected with COVID-19 and mortality rates are also increasing. In the absence of effective therapies or vaccines, the medical and scientific community have extensively explored a range of current available therapeutic agents, mainly focused on targeting viral replication as well as managing severe respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19. Vitamin D has emerged as one such candidate due to its recognized immunomodulatory effects. In this regard, the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling pathway may generate beneficial effects in acute respiratory distress syndrome by decreasing the cytokine/chemokine storm, thus having an important immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory role.</p><p>39307 Feb 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-immune-system>Vitamin D in Immune System</h5><p>Recent research has led to an explosion in our interest and our understanding of the role of vitamin D in regulation of immunity. At the molecular level, the hormonal form of vitamin D signals through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. The VDR and vitamin D metabolic enzymes are expressed throughout the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The advent of genome-wide approaches to gene expression profiling led to identification of numerous VDR-regulated genes implicated in regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. The molecular data infer that vitamin D signaling should boost innate immunity against pathogens of bacterial or viral origin.</p><p>82329 Oct 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-multiple-sclerosis>Vitamin D in Multiple Sclerosis</h5><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of central nervous system and is caused by an aberrant immune response to myelin sheath. Disease-modifying medications, which mainly aim to suppress such aberrant immune response, have significantly improved MS treatment. However, the disease severity continues to worsen. In contrast, progressively more data suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D, i.e., the active vitamin D, suppresses the differentiation of potentially pathogenic T cells associated with MS, enhances the differentiation of regulatory T cells that suppress the pathogenic T cells, and promotes remyelination. These novel 1,25(OH)2D functions have encouraged investigators to develop vitamin D as a potential therapy for MS. However, because of the hypercalcemia that is associated with high 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, supplementation of native vitamin D has been a major focus in clinical trials for the treatment of MS, but such trials have produced mixed data. In this article, we will review current progress in the supplementation of different vitamin D forms for the treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (i.e., an MS animal model) as well as MS.</p><p>60528 Oct 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-against-covid-19>Vitamin D against COVID-19</h5><p>Many studies suggest that vitamin D improves immune function, reducing susceptibility to infection.

With the decline in UV light intensity in winter, most skin production of vitamin D occurs in summer. Since no defined storage organ or tissue has been found for vitamin D, it has been assumed that an adequate vitamin D status in winter can only be maintained by oral supplementation. Skeletal muscle cells have now been shown to provide an extravascular conservation site for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which cycles between blood and muscle accounting for its long residence time in blood. In winter, this conservation mechanism appears to be upregulated by parathyroid hormone; a process that appears to have evolved to maintain adequate vitamin D status when vitamin D supply falls.</p><p>48317 Nov 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-rheumatic-diseases>Vitamin D and Rheumatic Diseases</h5><p>Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton. It is also considered an immunomodulatory agent that regulates innate and adaptive immune systems. The aim of this narrative review is to provide general concepts of vitamin D for the skeletal and immune health, and to summarize the mechanistic, epidemiological, and clinical evidence on the relationship between vitamin D and rheumatic diseases. Multiple observational studies have demonstrated the association between a low level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <a href=https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/18641>25(OH)D</a> and the presence and severity of several rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), spondyloarthropathies, and osteoarthritis (OA). Nevertheless, the specific benefits of vitamin D supplements for the treatment and prevention of rheumatic diseases are less accepted as the results from randomized clinical trials are inconsistent, although some conceivable benefits of vitamin D for the improvement of disease activity of RA, SLE, and OA have been demonstrated in meta-analyses. It is also possible that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D differently than others, as inter-individual difference in responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation has been observed in genomic studies. Although the optimal level of serum 25(OH)D is still debatable, it is advisable it is advisable that patients with rheumatic diseases should maintain a serum 25(OH)D level of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) to prevent osteomalacia, secondary osteoporosis, and fracture, and possibly 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L) to achieve maximal benefit from vitamin D for immune health and overall health.</p><p>49222 Nov 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-skeletal-muscle>Vitamin D and Skeletal Muscle</h5><p>Aging is associated with impairment in skeletal muscle mass and contractile function, predisposing to fat mass gain, insulin resistance and diabetes.

The best defined role of vitamin D in humans is in supporting the normal development and maintenance of bone tissues and in regulating calcium metabolism <sup>[7,8]</sup>.

Vitamin D endocrinology was established some 550 million years ago in animals, when the high-affinity nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor), transport proteins and enzymes for vitamin D metabolism evolved. This enabled vitamin D to regulate, via its target genes, physiological process, the first of which were detoxification and energy metabolism. In this way, vitamin D was enabled to modulate the energy-consuming processes of the innate immune system in its fight against microbes. In the evolving adaptive immune system, vitamin D started to act as a negative regulator of growth, which prevents overboarding reactions of T cells in the context of autoimmune diseases. When, some 400 million years ago, species left the ocean and were exposed to gravitation, vitamin D endocrinology took over the additional role as a major regulator of calcium homeostasis, being important for a stable skeleton.</p><p>23029 Jul 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-type-2-diabetes>Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes</h5><p>The management and early treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are essential to prevent further complications involving loss of quality of life and premature death.

COVID-19 is characterized by significant immune dysfunction, which is caused by strong but unregulated innate immunity with depressed adaptive immunity. Reduced and delayed responses to interferons (IFN-I/IFN-III) can increase the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and extensive immune cell infiltration into the airways, leading to pulmonary disease. The development of effective treatments for severe COVID-19 patients relies on our knowledge of the pathophysiological components of this imbalanced innate immune response. Strategies to address innate response factors will be essential. Significant efforts are currently underway to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines, such as inactivated DNA, mRNA, and protein subunit vaccines, have already been applied in clinical use. Various vaccines display different levels of effectiveness, and it is important to continue to optimize and update their composition in order to increase their effectiveness. However, due to the continuous emergence of variant viruses, improving the immunity of the general public may also increase the effectiveness of the vaccines. Many observational studies have demonstrated that serum levels of vitamin D are inversely correlated with the incidence or severity of COVID-19. Extensive evidence has shown that vitamin D supplementation could be vital in mitigating the progression of COVID-19 to reduce its severity. Vitamin D defends against SARS-CoV-2 through a complex mechanism through interactions between the modulation of innate and adaptive immune reactions, ACE2 expression, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-status-and-allergy-outcomes>Vitamin D Status and Allergy Outcomes</h5><p>The very early onset of allergic diseases points to the specific vulnerability of the developing immune system to environmental changes and the development of primary intervention strategies is crucial to address this unparalleled burden. Vitamin D is known to have immunomodulatory functions.

Interventions to improve vitamin D status, especially in early life, may be the key to allergic disease prevention.</p><p>30928 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-deficiency-status-in-malaysia>Vitamin D Deficiency Status in Malaysia</h5><p>Vitamin D is essential for maintaining serum calcium levels, ensuring sufficient bone mineralization, immunomodulatory properties, and a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, renal disease, cancer, as well as in pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency can be managed with pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches, depending on the severity. The objective is to raise serum vitamin D to a normal level, hence, relieving the symptoms and reducing the adverse health outcomes. Despite no clear guidelines in treating vitamin D deficiency in Malaysia, this condition can be prevented with taking adequate vitamin D in food resources, sun exposure, or supplementation.

Vitamin D status is influenced by genetic and environmental determinants. Several observational studies have evaluated the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D-related genes and vitamin D levels. Nevertheless, little is known about the role of these SNPs in the response to vitamin D supplementation. We conducted an interventional study to define the association between SNPs in vitamin D-related genes and the response to vitamin D supplementation in 100 self-reported healthy women of Arab ancestry for the majority. Methods. A total of 100 healthy female subjects received a weekly oral dose of 50,000 IU vitamin D for 12 weeks. Serum vitamin D concentration and metabolic profiles were measured at baseline and 12 weeks post-vitamin D supplementation. The genotypes of 37 SNPs selected from previously reported vitamin D-related genes have been assessed by Fluidigm genotyping assay. Results. Rs731236 (VDR gene) and rs7116978 (CYP2R1 gene) showed a significant association with vitamin D status. The rs731236 GG genotype and the rs7116978 CC genotype were associated with a “vitamin D sufficiency” state. Rs731236 GG and rs7116978 CC genotypes showed a higher response to vitamin D supplementation. Transcription factor binding site prediction analysis showed altered binding sites for transcription factors according to the different rs7116978 alleles. Interestingly, the 37 SNPs previously established to play a role in vitamin D-related pathways explained very little of the response to vitamin D supplementation in our cohort, suggesting the existence of alternative loci whose number and effect size need to be investigated in future studies. Conclusion. In this paper, we present novel data on vitamin D-related SNPs and response to vitamin D supplementation demonstrating the feasibility of applying functional genomic approaches in interventional studies to assess individual-level responses to vitamin D supplementation.</p><p>54131 Aug 2020</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-signaling-in-gastro-rheumatology>Vitamin D Signaling in Gastro-Rheumatology</h5><p>Vitamin D has been recently pointed out, and abnormalities of the vitamin D axis have been described in both in vitro and in vivo models of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and arthritis.</p><p>29229 Apr 2021</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-oral-diseases-development>Vitamin D in Oral Diseases Development</h5><p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid that plays a significant role in the whole body, including the maxillofacial region.

The relationship between vitamin D and insulin resistance has been a topic of growing interest. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels appear to be associated with most of the insulin resistance disorders described to date. In fact, vitamin D deficiency may be one of the factors accelerating the development of insulin resistance. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in the population and may be associated with the pathogenesis of diseases related to insulin resistance, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MS) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An important question is the identification of 25(OH)D levels capable of generating an effect on insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and to decrease the risk of developing insulin resistance related disorders.</p><p>8508 Aug 2023</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-cardiovascular-risk-and-disease>Vitamin D in Cardiovascular Risk and Disease</h5><p>Beyond its key role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D has been found to significantly affect the cardiovascular (CV) system. In fact, low vitamin D levels have been associated with increased CV risk, as well as increased CV morbidity and mortality. The majority of effects of this molecule are related directly or indirectly to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Generally, vitamin D insufficiency is considered for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels between 21–29 ng/mL (corresponding to 52.5–72.5 nmol/L), deficiency as 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL (&lt;50 nmol/L), and extreme deficiency as 25(OH)D less than 10 ng/mL (&lt;25 nmol/L). However, the definition of an optimal vitamin D status, as defined by 25(OH)D, remains controversial for many extra-bone conditions, including CV disease.</p><p>17015 Jun 2023</p><hr><h5 id=achieving-optimum-clinical-outcomes-with-vitamin-d>Achieving Optimum Clinical Outcomes with Vitamin D</h5><p>Musculoskeletal benefits of vitamin D include calcium homeostasis, bone mineralization, etc., through its hormonal actions. This requires serum 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL. In contrast, many other tissues require above 30 or 40 ng/mL steady-state concentrations. To reduce infections, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and all-cause mortality require a minimum level of 50 ng/mL. Vitamin D is an economical and widely available (generic) nutrient obtained over the counter without a prescription. At the recommended doses, vitamin D does not cause any adverse effects. Disease prevention and minimizing complications and premature deaths can be achieved by maintaining serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 50 and 80 ng/mL.

The vitamin D receptor is an example of a nuclear receptor, which binds vitamin D, and modulates the transcription of various target genes appropriately. Early in the history of life on Earth, nuclear receptors would have been selected for due to the strong pressure for organisms to respond to their environment. This eventually lead to the evolution of nuclear receptor families, such as the NR1H and NR1I families, capable of binding nutritional ligands and modulating transcription appropriately. Each of these families host a variety of receptors, including the vitamin D receptor, but all are thought to have originated from one ancestral receptor. Through major gene duplications and variable selective pressures, the various receptors within these families evolved, each one accommodating cholesterol derivatives, such as oxysterols, bile acids, and vitamin D.</p><p>27421 Nov 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-long-covid-19>Vitamin D in Long COVID-19</h5><p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly become a global pandemic. Reports from different parts of the world indicate that a significant proportion of people who have recovered from COVID-19 are suffering from various health problems collectively referred to as “long COVID-19”. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, joint pain, chest pain, muscle aches, headaches, and so on. Vitamin D is an immunomodulatory hormone with proven efficacy against various upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D can inhibit hyperinflammatory reactions and accelerate the healing process in the affected areas, especially in lung tissue. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 cases, with a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D found in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure. However, no evidence has been found to support a role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing symptoms of long-COVID-19. On the other hand, having a higher vitamin D level before SARS-CoV-2 infection or raising it rapidly at the first symptoms of infection can significantly reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19.</p><p>236129 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=ppars-and-vitamin-d-receptor-in-cancer>PPARs and Vitamin D Receptor in Cancer</h5><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, which respond to specific ligands such as polyunsaturated fatty acids by altering gene expression. Three subtypes of this receptor have been discovered, each evolving to achieve different biological functions. Like other nuclear receptors, the transcriptional activity of PPARs is affected not only by ligand-stimulation, but also by cross-talk with other molecules. For example, both PPARs and the RXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that coordinately regulate gene expression. In addition, PPARs and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling pathways regulate a multitude of genes that are of importance for cellular functions including cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Interaction of the PPARs and VDR signaling pathways has been shown at the level of molecular cross-regulation of their transcription factor. A variety of ligands influencing the PPARs and VDR signaling pathways have been shown to reveal chemopreventive potential by mediating tumor suppressive activities in human cancers.</p><p>6908 Sep 2023</p><hr><h5 id=impact-of-vitamin-d-in-tuberculosis>Impact of Vitamin D in Tuberculosis</h5><p>Vitamin D plays a crucial role in many infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), that remains one of the world’s top infectious killers with 1.5 million deaths from TB in 2021.

Vitamin D3 may also inhibit the transformation of normal mammary progenitors into breast cancer stem cells that initiate and sustain the growth of breast tumors. As long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in breast cancer pathogenesis, and the specific mechanisms underlying this role are poorly understood, we provided several arguments that vitamin D3/VDR may induce protective effects in breast cancer through modulation of lncRNAs that are important for breast cancer pathogenesis.</p><p>30601 Apr 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-and-its-neuroimmunological-roles>Vitamin D and Its Neuroimmunological Roles</h5><p>Vitamin D consists of a group of structurally related secosteroids, including cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, calcidiol), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D, calcitriol).

Both vitamin D and <span>[25(OH]</span>D: calcifediol) and its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D: calcitriol]</span>, play critical roles in protecting humans from invasive pathogens, reducing risks of autoimmunity, and maintaining better health. Conversely, low 25(OH)D status increases susceptibility to infections and developing autoimmunity. Individuals obtain optimal results by maintaining serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) (above 40 ng/mL in the population): this also minimizes community outbreaks and autoimmune disorders. In over 97.5% of people, this can be achieved through daily sun exposure (except in countries far from the equator during winter) or taking between 5,000 and 8,000 IU vitamin D supplements daily (average, ~70 to 90 IU/kg body weight).

There is conflicting epidemiological evidence regarding vitamin D, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and cutaneous melanoma (CMM), confounded by the effect of sun exposure and other factors.</p><p>27629 Mar 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-oxidative-stress-and-aging>Vitamin D, Oxidative-Stress and Aging</h5><p>Recent advances in vitamin D research indicate that this vitamin, a secosteroid hormone, has beneficial effects on several body systems other than the musculoskeletal system. Both 25 dihydroxy vitamin D <span>[25(OH)2D]</span> and its active hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D]</span> are essential for human physiological functions, including damping down inflammation and the excessive intracellular oxidative stresses. Vitamin D is one of the key controllers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial respiratory function, and thus, the aging process in humans. In turn, molecular and cellular actions form 1,25(OH)2D slow down oxidative stress, cell and tissue damage, and the aging process. On the other hand, hypovitaminosis D impairs mitochondrial functions, and enhances oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. The interaction of 1,25(OH)2D with its intracellular receptors modulates vitamin D–dependent gene transcription and activation of vitamin D-responsive elements, which triggers multiple second messenger systems. Thus, it is not surprising that hypovitaminosis D increases the incidence and severity of several age-related common diseases, such as metabolic disorders that are linked to oxidative stress. These include obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, pregnancy complications, memory disorders, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, certain cancers, and systemic inflammatory diseases. Vitamin D adequacy leads to less oxidative stress and improves mitochondrial and endocrine functions, reducing the risks of disorders, such as autoimmunity, infections, metabolic derangements, and impairment of DNA repair; all of this aids a healthy, graceful aging process. Vitamin D is also a potent anti-oxidant that facilitates balanced mitochondrial activities, preventing oxidative stress-related protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. New understandings of vitamin D-related advances in metabolomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, in relation to its ability to control oxidative stress in conjunction with micronutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants, following normalization of serum 25(OH)D and tissue 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, likely to promise cost-effective better clinical outcomes in humans.</p><p>161529 Oct 2020</p><hr><h5 id=the-relationship-between-vitamin-d-and-estrogens>The Relationship between Vitamin D and Estrogens</h5><p>Vitamin D has a potential role of regulating many cellular functions.

Several vitamin D metabolites are generated in the liver, the kidney, and in other tissue types, which are then excreted in the urine. The most investigated and important forms are 24-hydroxylated (i.e., 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D3); these forms are converted from 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, respectively. CYP24A1 24-hydroxylase enzyme, which is responsible for these conversions—similarly to CYP27B1, a multicomponent enzyme in the mitochondria—is regulated by calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 through VDR, the receptor of vitamin D. Long-term imbalance in this system or an inappropriate amount of cytochrome P450 enzymes—which control the production, regulation, and degradation of vitamin D—can cause vitamin D insufficiency-related diseases. Thus, abnormally elevated levels of CYP24A1 can create a deficit in vitamin D levels, since this enzyme is uniquely responsible for the catabolism of vitamin D. Elevated levels of CYP24A1 are observed in breast, prostate, esophageal, colon, and lung cancers, genetically linked hypophosphatemia, diabetic nephropathy, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Deficiency of vitamin D can also develop due to an inadequate amount of sun exposure and insufficient nutritional supplementation, or it can appear as a result of certain diseases, e.g., diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or genetically linked hypophosphatemia.</p><p>21728 Apr 2023</p><hr><h5 id=effects-of-vitamin-d-on-the-immune-system>Effects of Vitamin D on the Immune System</h5><p>Vitamin D intervenes in calcium and phosphate metabolism and bone homeostasis.

Similarly, resveratrol regulates immunity, modifying the gene expression and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the immune cells. Therefore, it plays an immunomodulatory role that can be beneficial in the prevention and development of non-communicable diseases associated with inflammation. Since both vitamin D and resveratrol also act as immunomodulators in inflammatory pathologies, many studies have paid particular attention to an integrated treatment of either vitamin D or resveratrol in the immune reaction against SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p><p>9928 Jun 2023</p><hr><h5 id=oligodendrocytes-and-vitamin-d-neuroprotection-in-multiple-sclerosis>Oligodendrocytes and Vitamin D Neuroprotection in Multiple Sclerosis</h5><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurological condition that involves both inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative components. MS research and treatments have traditionally focused on immunomodulation, with less investigation of neuroprotection, and this holds true for the role of vitamin D in MS. Vitamin D plays an anti-inflammatory role in modulating the immune system in MS. More recently, researchers have begun investigating the potential neuroprotective role of vitamin D in MS, which may be important in remyelination and/or the prevention of demyelination. There is a growing body of research uncovering mechanistic role of vitamin D-mediated neuroprotection, including: enhancing oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation, enhancing neurotrophin expression, attenuating aberrant microglial and reactive astrocyte activation, stabilizing the BBB, and reducing oxidative stress. 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes stem cell proliferation and drives the differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes, which carry out remyelination.</p><p>15624 Oct 2023</p><hr><h5 id=consensus-on-the-prevention-of-vitamin-d-deficiency>Consensus on the Prevention of Vitamin D Deficiency</h5><p>Vitamin D is crucial for musculoskeletal health, as it plays an important role in the regulation of bone and mineral metabolism, and it can prevent and cure nutritional rickets and osteomalacia. In addition, vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in almost all human cells suggests, or even documents, a more widespread role of vitamin D for overall health, a notion that is supported by several experimental and epidemiological studies.

In both cases, natural selection has favored the survival of those individuals who use vitamin D more efficiently or have some kind of workaround that ensures sufficient uptake of calcium and other essential minerals from food passing through the intestines. Vitamin D scarcity has either cultural or genetic solutions. Cultural solutions include consumption of meat in a raw or boiled state and extended breastfeeding of children. Genetic solutions include higher uptake of calcium from the intestines, higher rate of conversion of vitamin D to its most active form, stronger binding of vitamin D to carrier proteins in the bloodstream, and greater use of alternative metabolic pathways for calcium uptake.

This evidence also includes its connection to various genitourinary disorders and symptoms. Numerous clinical studies have observed improvements in vulvovaginal symptoms linked to the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) with vitamin D supplementation. These studies have reported positive effects on various aspects such as vaginal pH, dryness, sexual functioning, reduced libido, and a decrease in urinary tract infections. Many mechanisms underlying these pharmacological effects have since been proposed. Vitamin D receptors (VDRs) have been identified as a major contributor to its effects. It is now well known that VDRs are expressed in the superficial layers of the urogenital organs. Additionally, vitamin D plays a crucial role in supporting immune function and modulating the body&rsquo;s defense mechanisms. However, the characterization of these effects requires more investigation. Reviewing existing evidence regarding vitamin D&rsquo;s impact on post-menopausal women&rsquo;s vaginal, sexual, and urological health is the purpose of this article.

In RCTs, with proper daily or once-a-week vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group, the serum 25(OH)D concentration must be meaningfully increased to the above pre-planned level to ensure the validity of the clinical study. Clinical outcomes correlate well with the serum 25(OH)D concentrations but not necessarily with the administered doses. It is a common error by researchers and healthcare workers to assume that the amount taken automatically produces the stipulated serum levels.</p><p>38601 Nov 2023</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-serum-concentrations-and-covid-19-1>Vitamin D Serum Concentrations and COVID-19</h5><p>Active vitamin D <span>[1,25(OH)2D3—calcitriol]</span> is a secosteroid hormone whose receptor is expressed on all cells of the immune system. Vitamin D has a global anti-inflammatory effect and its role in the management of a SARS-CoV-2 infection has been investigated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>19723 Nov 2022</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-cost-effectively-overcoming-infections-and-chronic-diseases-1>Vitamin D: Cost-Effectively Overcoming Infections and Chronic Diseases</h5><p>The prevalence of chronic diseases increases with age, especially in those with co-morbidities. The two most common denominators are the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and low concentrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor-2 (ACE2). Whether vitamin D deficiency initiates or aggravates chronic diseases is unclear: the likelihood is both. Hypovitaminosis D negatively affects all body systems, especially the musculoskeletal and immune systems. Many chronic conditions and infections can be minimized using the right dose of vitamin D supplements administered at the right frequency (daily or once weekly) or direct sun exposure to one-third of the skin between 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM, in summer like sunlight, for 20 to 60 minutes depending on the skin tone. It is advisable to wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat to protect one’s eyes and face. Maintaining the population serum 25(OH)D concentration above 40 ng/mL (i.e., sufficiency) ensures a better immune system, minimizing symptomatic diseases and reducing infections and chronic diseases. The best clinical outcome and longevity are expected from maintaining the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations between 50 and 80 ng/mL.</p><p>56104 Sep 2023</p><hr><h5 id=vitamin-d-in-cardiovascular-risk-and-disease-1>Vitamin D in Cardiovascular Risk and Disease</h5><p>Beyond its key role in calcium homeostasis, vitamin D has been found to significantly affect the cardiovascular (CV) system. In fact, low vitamin D levels have been associated with increased CV risk, as well as increased CV morbidity and mortality. The majority of effects of this molecule are related directly or indirectly to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Generally, vitamin D insufficiency is considered for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels between 21–29 ng/mL (corresponding to 52.5–72.5 nmol/L), deficiency as 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL (&lt;50 nmol/L), and extreme deficiency as 25(OH)D less than 10 ng/mL (&lt;25 nmol/L). However, the definition of an optimal vitamin D status, as defined by 25(OH)D, remains controversial for many extra-bone conditions, including CV disease.</p><p>17015 Jun 2023</p><hr><h5 id=improving-clinical-outcomes-by-maintaining-vitamin-d-sufficiency-1>Improving Clinical Outcomes by Maintaining Vitamin D Sufficiency</h5><p>Treatment of vitamin D deficiency costs less than 0.01% of one-day hospitalization. Despite cost-benefits, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency remains high worldwide. This was vivid among those who died from COVID-19—most had vitamin D deficiency. Yet, the lack of direction to use vitamin D as an adjunct therapy from health agencies was astonishing. Data confirmed that keeping an individual’s serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) (and above 40 ng/mL in the population) reduces risks from community outbreaks and autoimmune disorders. Maintaining such concentrations in 97.5% of people is achievable through daily safe sun exposure (except in countries far from the equator during winter) or taking between 5,000 and 8,000 IU vitamin D supplements daily (average, ~70 to 90 IU/kg body weight). Those with gastrointestinal malabsorption, obesity, or on medications that increase catabolism of vitamin D and a few specific disorders require much higher intake. The text evaluates the doses and administration of vitamin D necessary for better clinical outcomes regarding disease prevention and treatment.</p><p>14226 Sep 2023</p><hr><h5 id=relationship-between-vitamin-d-and-insulin-resistance-1>Relationship between Vitamin D and Insulin Resistance</h5><p>Vitamin D seems to be involved in infections, autoimmune diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and cancer development. The relationship between vitamin D and insulin resistance has been a topic of growing interest. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels appear to be associated with most of the insulin resistance disorders described to date. In fact, vitamin D deficiency may be one of the factors accelerating the development of insulin resistance. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in the population and may be associated with the pathogenesis of diseases related to insulin resistance, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MS) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An important question is the identification of 25(OH)D levels capable of generating an effect on insulin resistance, glucose metabolism and to decrease the risk of developing insulin resistance related disorders.</p><p>8508 Aug 2023</p><hr><h5 id=serum-metabolomes-of-gastric-cancers>Serum Metabolomes of Gastric Cancers</h5><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is ranked third in cancer deaths world-wide. It is separated anatomically into either gastric adenocarcinomas (non-cardia GC) or gastro-esophageal-junction adenocarcinomas (cardia GC) and is further classified histologically into either diffuse or intestinal types.</p><p>44625 Feb 2021</p><hr><h5 id=serum-bilirubin-in-obese-individuals>Serum Bilirubin in Obese Individuals</h5><p>Bilirubin, the end product of heme metabolism, is a potent endogenous antioxidant with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, and endocrine properties. Serum bilirubin concentrations depend on the complex interactions between bilirubin production, consumption (depending on oxidative stress and inflammation), metabolism, and elimination. Importantly, numerous studies have shown that serum bilirubin levels are inversely associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and other oxidative-stress-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis. Moreover, serum bilirubin levels were recently proposed as a potential pre-disease biomarker for developing metabolic syndrome in asymptomatic middle-aged individuals.</p><p>54307 Sep 2021</p><hr><h5 id=achieving-optimum-clinical-outcomes-with-vitamin-d-1>Achieving Optimum Clinical Outcomes with Vitamin D</h5><p>Musculoskeletal benefits of vitamin D include calcium homeostasis, bone mineralization, etc., through its hormonal actions. This requires serum 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL. In contrast, many other tissues require above 30 or 40 ng/mL steady-state concentrations. To reduce infections, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and all-cause mortality require a minimum level of 50 ng/mL. Vitamin D is an economical and widely available (generic) nutrient obtained over the counter without a prescription. At the recommended doses, vitamin D does not cause any adverse effects. Disease prevention and minimizing complications and premature deaths can be achieved by maintaining serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 50 and 80 ng/mL. This costs less than 0.01% of the cost of one day of hospitalization.</p><p>21621 Sep 2023</p><p>–-</p><h5 id=serum-25ohd-and-cognition-1>Serum 25(OH)D and Cognition</h5><p>Vitamin D, also referred to as serum 25(OH)D, reflects a group of fat-soluble steroids best known for increasing the intestinal absorption of minerals, specifically calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The impact of serum 25(OH)D on skeletal diseases, such as rickets, has been well documented. There is growing appreciation for the role of vitamin D in cognition and potentially Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>15508 Aug 2022</p><hr><h5 id=hypervitaminosis-d>Hypervitaminosis D</h5><p>Hypervitaminosis D is a state of vitamin D toxicity.
