OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis is the first to evaluate the associations of circulating and dietary intake of vitamin D with risk of risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Our findings showed that higher circulating vitamin D level and dietary vitamin D intake were associated with a reduced risk of RCC. The possible explanation might be attributed to the anti-inflammatory effect, inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases from their inception points through December 2018 for observational studies. The pooled relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was employed to assess the quality of the included studies.

RESULTS: A total of 9 publications were included in this meta-analysis. An overall analysis of the highest versus lowest intake levels revealed that circulating vitamin D level was protectively associated with risk of RCC 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.89, P=0.001), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=38.8%, P=0.162). In addition, dietary vitamin D intake was associated with a reduced risk of RCC (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 75-0.99, P=0.030). Statistical heterogeneity was not identified (I2=28.8%, P=0.199). Subgroup analyses results showed the gender differences, and the associations were significant in results with women participants (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.55-0.88) and case-control studies (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.95).

#### Liver cancer 2.1X more likely if low vitamin D - meta-analysis April 2021

 **Effect of Vitamin D Deficiency on Liver Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis** 

Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Apr 1;22(4):991-997. [doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.991.](https://doi.org/10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.4.991.)

Epidemiological studies have showed that vitamin D deficiency can increase the risk of liver cancers. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels and liver cancer risk.

Methods: Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, and Embase were searched up to Mar. 2020, and the references of those studies were also searched by hand. A meta-analysis of 11 studies was performed which met the inclusion criteria. Six case-control studies and five cohort studies were included.

Results: A total of 11 studies (6 case-control and 5 cohort studies) with 12,895 incident cases were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that liver cancer risk was significantly increased for vitamin D deficiency, and the pooled RR and its 95% CIs was  **2.16**  (1.2, 3.88; P = 0.01). In comparative analyses between 25(OH)D levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) and those in the control group individuals, the summary RR of liver cancer was -1.11 (95% CI=-1.96 to -0.25). The subgroup analysis of the different geographical region of the population showed that the risk of liver cancer in Asian subgroup, European subgroup and Egyptian subgroup increased for vitamin D deficiency (RR=1.34,95% CI 0.72 to 2.48, p <0.00001; RR=2.53,95% CI 1.62 to 3.93,p <0.0001;RR=29.5,95% CI 4.14 to 209.93, P=0.88).

Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of liver cancer. The 25(OH)D3 levels are lower in HCC patients than those in health controls. Maintenance of sufficient serum vitamin D levels would be beneficial for prevention of liver cancer.

CONCLUSION: Higher circulating vitamin D level and higher dietary vitamin D intake both might be associated with a reduced risk of RCC. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are required in the future to confirm our results.
