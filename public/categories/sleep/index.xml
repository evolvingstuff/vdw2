&lt;p>Background: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that serum vitamin D levels are abnormally low in sleep clinic patients admitting to chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain and to assess the associated risk factors. A secondary purpose was to identify a clinical biomarker for vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Handout on Vitamin D (Hormone D) and sleep - Gominak 2012</title><link>/posts/handout-on-vitamin-d-hormone-d-and-sleep-gominak-2012.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/handout-on-vitamin-d-hormone-d-and-sleep-gominak-2012.html</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="vitamin-d-hormone">(Vitamin) D Hormone&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>If you have a neurologic problem that is severe enough to see a neurologist, you probably do not heal your body in sleep as perfectly as you once did. Most of us who have headaches, tremor, balance difficulties, vertigo, burning in the feet, depression, body pain, or memory loss have abnormal sleep and, surprisingly, fixing the sleep can fix the neurologic problem. From 2005-2009 I performed sleep studies on most of my patients and used medications or sleep masks to try to help their sleep. In 2009 I accidentally discovered that most of my patients had abnormal sleep because they were vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D deficiency is probably why you are coming to see me today even though you don’t know it. Though we might end up talking about vitamin D I am not really as interested in vitamins as I am in sleep.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Severe Sleep Loss Reduced Immune System – wonder about vitamin D reduction</title><link>/posts/severe-sleep-loss-reduced-immune-system-wonder-about-vitamin-d-reduction.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/severe-sleep-loss-reduced-immune-system-wonder-about-vitamin-d-reduction.html</guid><description/></item><item><title>7 improvements in lives of veterans with chronic pain with 50,000 IU vitamin D weekly</title><link>/posts/7-improvements-in-lives-of-veterans-with-chronic-pain-with-50000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/7-improvements-in-lives-of-veterans-with-chronic-pain-with-50000-iu-vitamin-d-weekly.html</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="improvement-of-pain-sleep-and-quality-of-life-in-chronic-pain-patients-with-vitamin-d-supplementation">Improvement of Pain, Sleep, and Quality of Life in Chronic Pain Patients With Vitamin D Supplementation.&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>Background&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) is currently thought to be an autoimmune-mediated disorder in which environmental risk factors make a significant contribution to its development. It was proposed that &lt;strong>vitamin D deficiency plays a role in autoimmune diseases&lt;/strong> . Here we investigated whether NC can be associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level deficiency in patients with NC compared with gender- and age-matched normal controls.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sleep Apnea and vitamin D</title><link>/posts/sleep-apnea-and-vitamin-d.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/sleep-apnea-and-vitamin-d.html</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="hypothesis-by-dr-gominak-in-texas-sleep-problems-and-sleep-apnea-are-due-to-a-lack-of-vitamins-d3-and-b12">Hypothesis by Dr. Gominak in Texas: Sleep problems and Sleep Apnea are due to a lack of vitamins D3 and B12&lt;/h3>
