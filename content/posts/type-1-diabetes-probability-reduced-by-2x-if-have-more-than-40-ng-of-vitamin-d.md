To determine whether serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in young adults are associated with risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), we conducted a prospective, nested case-control study among US active-duty military personnel with serum in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository, identifying 310 T1D cases diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 with at least 2 serum samples collected before disease onset and 613 controls matched to cases on age, sex, race/ethnicity, branch of military service, and dates of serum collection. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. 

Among non-Hispanic whites, those with average 25(OH)D levels of ≥100 nmol/L had a 44% lower risk of developing T1D than those with average 25(OH)D levels <75 nmol/L (rate ratio = 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.90, P for trend = 0.03) over an average follow-up of 5.4 years. In quintile analyses, T1D risk was highest among individuals whose 25(OH)D levels were in the lowest 20% of those measured. 

There was no association between 25(OH)D levels and risk of T1D among non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics. 

Low 25(OH)D levels may predispose healthy, young, non-Hispanic white adults to the development of T1D.
