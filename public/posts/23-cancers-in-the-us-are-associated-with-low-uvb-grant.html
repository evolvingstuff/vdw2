The goals of this study were to determine the extent to which solar UVB doses still reduced cancer risk compared to findings reported in 2006 for cancer mortality rates for the periods 1950-1969 and 1970-1794 as well as cancer incidence rates for the period 1998-2002 and to determine which factors were recently associated with cancer risk. The cancer data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Indices were obtained for solar UVB at the surface for July 1992, and alcohol consumption, and diabetes and obesity prevalence near the 2016-2020 period. Lung cancer incidence rates were also used in the analyses. The cancers for which solar UVB is significantly associated with reduced incidence are bladder, brain (males), breast, corpus uteri, esophageal, gastric, non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, pancreatic, and renal cancer. Lung cancer was significantly associated with colorectal, laryngeal, and renal cancer. Diabetes was also significantly associated with breast, liver, and lung cancer. Obesity prevalence was significantly associated with breast, colorectal and renal cancer. Alcohol consumption was associated with bladder and esophageal cancer. Thus diet has become a very important driver of cancer incidence rates. The dietary approach that would reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity, lung cancer, and, therefore cancer, would be one based mostly on whole-plants and restrictions on red and processed meats and ultraprocessed foods.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/cancer-incidence-vs-uvb.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h5 id=uvb-probably-decrease-of-cancer-even-more-if-the-entire-year-had-been-considered-not-just-july>UVB probably decrease of Cancer even more if the entire year had been considered, not just July.</h5><p><strong>There are perhaps 10X more hours per year with UVB >3 in <span style=color:#f06>Florida</span> than<span style=color:#90f>Alaska</span></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748382322"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748382322",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748382322"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748382322"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748382322"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748382322"></script></body></html>
