#### WHO will be eliminating YouTube medical misinformation - Sept 2023

 **[WHO's 'Take Over' of Youtube Portends Orwellian Medical Dystopia' Green Med Info](https://greenmedinfo.com/blog/whos-take-over-youtube-portends-orwellian-medical-dystopia)** 

* From this point onward, any content that contradicts or diverges from the WHO's official health guidance may be deemed "harmful content" in violation of Youtube's "Community Guidelines" and will now be subject to censorship or removal. 

* In a post titled, " **[A long term vision for YouTube's medical misinformation policies](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/a-long-term-vision-for-medical-misinformation-policies/?linkId=8954528)** ," Youtube shared its "thinking about the future of medical misinformation policies, including removing cancer misinformation."

 **Their vaccine-specific guidance includes censorship of any of the following topics:** 

* Vaccine safety: Content alleging that vaccines cause chronic side effects, such as cancer or paralysis, outside of rare side effects that are recognized by health authorities.

* Examples:

   * Claims that the  **[MMR vaccine](https://greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-mumps-measles-rubella-mmr)**  causes autism.

   * Claims that any [ **vaccine** ](https://greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all) causes contraction of COVID-19.

   * Claims that vaccines are part of a depopulation agenda.

   * Claims that the  **[flu](https://greenmedinfo.com/disease/influenza-0)**  vaccine causes chronic side effects such as [ **infertility** ](https://greenmedinfo.com/disease/infertility), or causes contraction of COVID-19.

   * Claims that the  **[HPV](https://greenmedinfo.com/disease/human-papillomavirus-hpv)**  vaccine causes chronic side effects such as paralysis.

   * Claims that an approved COVID-19 vaccine will cause death, infertility, miscarriage, autism, or contraction of other infectious diseases.

   * Claims that achieving herd immunity through natural infection is safer than vaccinating the population.

   * Content that promotes the use of unapproved or homemade COVID-19 vaccines.

 **Vaccine efficacy: Content claiming that vaccines do not reduce transmission or contraction of disease.** 

   * Examples:

      * Claims that vaccines do not reduce risk of contracting illness.

      * Claims that vaccines do not reduce the severity of illness, including hospitalization or death.

      * Claims that any vaccine is a guaranteed prevention method for COVID-19.
