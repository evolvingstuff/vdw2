#### Impact of Vitamin D Deficiency on the Productivity of a Health Care Workforce.

2 Allina Hospitals and Clinics; and University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management, Minneapolis, Minn.

OBJECTIVE: To define the relationship between vitamin D status and employee  **presenteeism** in a large sample of health care employees.

METHODS: Prospective observation study of 10,646 employees of a Midwestern-integrated health care system who completed an on-line health risk appraisal questionnaire and were measured for 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

RESULTS: Measured differences in productivity due to  **presenteeism** were 0.66, 0.91, and 0.75 when comparing employees above and below vitamin D levels of 20 ng/mL, 30 ng/mL, and 40 ng/mL, respectively. These productivity differences translate into potential productivity savings of 0.191%, 0.553%, and 0.625%, respectively, of total payroll costs.

CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D status is associated with reduced employee work productivity. Employee vitamin D assessment and replenishment may represent a low-cost, high-return program to mitigate risk factors and health conditions that drive total employer health care costs.

Employees: 10,500, mainly white female nurses

Employees were asked to rate, on a scale of 0-10, how much health problems during the past week had effected their productivity.  

Results of vitamin D blood test: average 29 ng, with 29% < 20ng, 6% < 10 ng

The results varied, not unexpectedly, inversely with their vitamin D levels, that is, the more that health affected their work, the lower their vitamin D levels

#### <span style="color:#00F;">More likely to report that productvitiy was effected by health problems if low vitamin D</span>

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/work-while-sick-vs-vitamin-d.jpg" alt="image" width="500">

 **< 20 ng = 5.6;  < 40 ng = 4.5 (on a scale of 0-10)** 

#### Perspective on  **presenteeism** 

* 5% for this study of health care employees – who had paid sick leave!

* 2% for healthy populations

* 29% for those with <a href="/posts/allergies" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1604">allergies</a>

* 40% for individuals with <a href="/posts/pain" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1777">pain</a>

#### This study does not apply to those who no paid sick leave (30%),  
 or who have used up all of their sick leave

#### Unlikely that <a href="/posts/chronic-pain" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1777">chronic pain</a> was considered by the survey

#### Benefits to employers include

* Less Sick leave - both due to decreased sickness by employee and family

> It the spouse or children get sick an employee may take "personal leave"

> Sick leave incurs cost to hire a temp replacement who is typically less productive

> Employee will get back to work more quickly after a sickness, hospital procedure

* Less sickness while on the job 

> this  **presenteeism** study shows productivity lowered even more if present if they have low vitamin D

> if the employee sickness is contagious it can spread to co-workers (colds, flu)

* Less health care costs for the individual

> which should result in decreased health care premiums for the smaller employers

#### Might get 5% employer benefit if get most employees and families to increase vitamin D

#### Employers might focus on employees where they would get the most benefit

* Essential employees (managers, and others for whom a temp is not possible)

* Employees with <a href="/posts/dark-skins" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1064">dark skins</a>

* Employees who are <a href="/posts/over-weight" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 710">over-weight</a>

* Employees who have already had vitamin D-related medical problems

* Employees who especially get colds and the <a href="/posts/flu-in-the-winter" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 2211">flu in the winter</a>

* Employees who are <a href="/posts/55-years-old" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 28">> 55 years old </a>

> Seniors get about 1/4 as much vitamin D from the sun as juniors

> Vitamin D will reduce sickness AND restore their cognitive abilities

* Employees who work <a href="/posts/3rd-shift" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1800">3rd shift</a> 

* Employees who work [far from the equator](https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-browse_categories.php?parentId=63&sort_mode=created_desc) and get less sun (for very large companies)

* Employees who work in areas with <a href="/posts/extremely-hot-sun" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1758">extremely hot sun</a> (Phoenix, Middle East)

> Employees avoid the hot sun so much that they often have very low levels of vitamin D - in the summer!

* Employees who are <a href="/posts/pregnant" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 816">pregnant</a>

> Less sick leave, less complications from pregnancy, less trouble with the new-born

#### Real employee costs consists of many things -  **<span style="color:#09F;">some costs are reduced by vitamin D</span>** 

* Hiring/ Recruiting – turnover (25% to 200% of annual salary)

>  **<span style="color:#09F;">employee stays with employer who is concerned his health</span>** 

>  **<span style="color:#09F;">employee does not have to leave to to his own illness or illness in immediate family</span>** 

> lost productivity as replacement comes up to speed, training, moving,

* Retirement pension - **<span style="color:#09F;">healthier person has fare fewer major health expenses</span>** 

* Health insurance (single vs family) -  **<span style="color:#09F;">small employers can get lower cost on healthy group insurance</span>** 

* Sick leave - **<span style="color:#09F;">less sick leave taken for employee or family illness</span>** 

* Vacation pay

* Medicare 2.9% (employee + employer)

* Holiday pay

* Unemployment insurance

* social security 

* workman's compensation (0.3% to 7.5%)
