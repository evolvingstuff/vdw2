<!-- ~tc~ - NF-kappaB is suppressed and Nrf2 is upregulated, both of which help fend off viruses.  Vitamin D performs these same two functions.  The nrf2 vitamin D link was made about 7 years ago while the NF-kappaB was more like 15 or 16 years ago.  This article is an editorial.  One of the authors is owner of a nutraceutical firm.

Some reasons to believe that Melatonin could work ( from M.M Jan 2021)

1.  HMGB1 inhibition

2. NFkB  suppression

3. Nrf2 up regulation

4.TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6 IL-8  reduction

5.  IL-10 elevation

6.  NLRP3 inhibition
