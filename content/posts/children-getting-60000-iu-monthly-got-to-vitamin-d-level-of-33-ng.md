#### Efficacy and safety of a single monthly dose of cholecalciferol in healthy school children.

J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Sep 3.  [doi: 10.1515/jpem-2015-0187](https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2015-0187)

OBJECTIVE:

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single monthly dose of cholecalciferol in healthy school children.

METHODS:

A total of 118 children of class VI of a residential school were selected to receive vitamin D supplementation in the form of oral cholecalciferol 60,000 IU monthly. Serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels were estimated at 0 and 12 months. The proportion of subjects achieving vitamin D sufficiency was assessed.

RESULTS:

The mean 25OHD levels increased significantly from 12.04±5.27 ng/mL at baseline to 32.6±7.05 ng/mL after 12 months of supplementation (p<0.001). None developed hypercalcemia.

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D supplementation in the doses of 60,000 IU monthly is a reasonable, safe and cost-effective regimen for children to attain and maintain vitamin D sufficiency.

#### Note: Previous studies have found that the benefit decreases somewhat when dosing frequency is > 21 days.

50,000 every three weeks would probably be better, but not as easy to remember

Are these 6th grade children?

Dose is related to body weight.
