Methods: Using big-data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform, we analysed clinical data from patients with COVID-19 atended in a terciary university hospital from March 2020 to March 2021. 

Results: Of the 143.157 analysed patients, 36.261 subjects had COVID-19 infection (25.33%); during this period; of these 2588 had vitamin D deficiency (7.14%). Among subjects with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency, there was a *higher proportion 

* of women OR 1.45 <span>[95% CI 1.33-1.57]</span>, 

* adults older than 80 years OR 2.63 <span>[95%CI 2.38-2.91]</span>, 

* people living in nursing homes OR 2.88 <span>[95%CI 2.95-3.45]</span> and 

* walking dependence OR 3.45 <span>[95%CI 2.85-4.26]</span>. 

Regarding clinical course, a higher number of subjects with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency

* required hospitalitation OR 2.41 <span>[95%CI 2.22-2-61]</span>, 

* intensive unit care (ICU) OR 2.22 <span>[95% CI 1.64-3.02]</span>, had a 

* longer mean hospital stay 3.94 (2.29) p=0.02 and 

* higher mortality OR 1.82 <span>[95%CI 1.66-2.01]</span>.) 

Conclusion: Low serum 25 (OH) Vitamin-D level was significantly associated with a worse clinical evolution and prognosis of COVID-19 infection. We found a higher proportion of institutionalised and dependent people over 80 years of age among patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency.
