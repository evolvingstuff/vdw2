Background: Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is related to fragility fracture. In most previous studies, there was no assessment of vitamin D deficiency status separately for hip fracture types. The first aim is to evaluate vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) status in patients with hip fracture. The second objective is to determine whether there are differences in vitamin D and PTH between the femoral neck fracture and the femoral metaphyseal fracture group.

Methods: 62 men and 248 women with fragility hip fractures were enrolled. 25-hydroxyviamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and intact PTH (iPTH) values were evaluated, and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) was measured on the uninjured side. Vertebral fractures (VFs) were assessed using radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine. We examined the relationships of 25(OH)D value with the number of prevalent VFs, T-score of femoral neck, and iPTH level. These analyses were also performed, neck fracture and trochanteric fracture separately.

Results: Mean age was 85 years. The mean 25(OH)D was 11.2 (range, 4.0-26.1) ng/ml, whereas the mean iPTH value was 48.9 pg/ml (range, 9-429 pg/ml). The mean number of VFs was 1.5 (range, 0-11), and the mean T-score was -3.3 (range, -5.2 to -0.5). There was a weak correlation between the 25(OH)D value and the number of VFs. There was a weak but significant correlation between 25(OH)D and iPTH values. In the patients with trochanteric fractures, 25(OH)D value was significantly lower and iPTH value was significantly higher than those with neck fractures. There was a significant correlation between the 25(OH)D value and number of the VFs, 25(OH)D, and iPTH values only in trochanteric fractures.

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency was severe and PTH levels were higher in the trochanteric fractures. Both vitamin D deficiency and high PTH levels were suggested to have association with bone fragility.
