Objectives

To explore associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and a wide range of health conditions, physical performance measures, disability, and mortality in a large epidemiological study to identify an optimum range for 25(OH)D concentrations.

Design

Cross-sectional study, with additional prospective data on falls and mortality.

Setting

Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project, Sydney, Australia.

Participants

Community-dwelling men aged 70 and older (N = 1,659).

Measurements

Serum 25(OH)D levels, general health status, self-reported diseases, physical performance measures, disability (activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living) and falls.

Results

* Fair, poor, and very poor health; 

* self-reported diabetes mellitus; 

* hyperglycemia; 

* depression; 

* muscle weakness; 

* poor balance; and 

* all-cause mortality 

were all associated with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 50 nmol/L, even after adjustment for confounding. The findings also suggest that, in older men, for a wide range of health conditions, physical performance measures, disability, falls, and mortality, the optimum range of 25(OH)D is between 50.0 and 74.9 nmol/L, with no additional benefit for 25(OH)D levels of 75.0 nmol/L or greater.

Conclusion

Programs aimed at achieving an optimum range of serum 25(OH)D at levels between 50.0 and 74.9 nmol/L may have overall health benefits and such levels are adequate for older men.
