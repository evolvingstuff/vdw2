#### Future childhood pneumonia cut in half by 300,000 IU of Vitamin D - meta-analysis Oct 2020

 **Efficacy of High-Dose Vitamin D Supplementation as an Adjuvant Treatment on Pneumonia: Systematic Review and a Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Studies** 

Nutrition in Clinical Practice  October 2020 https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10585 Behind !2 paywall

Chao Yang MD, PhD, Yifei Lu MD, Min Wan MPH, Dengfeng Xu MD, PhD, Xian Yang MD, PhD, Ligang Yang MD, PhD, Shaokang Wang MD, PhD, Guiju Sun MD, PhD

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to summarize randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence and evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D (VD) supplementation as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of pneumonia. Data sources published from the inception dates up to January 2020 were searched. RCTs of VD supplementation of any duration, age, and dosing regimen type were eligible for inclusion if data on pneumonia were collected. Thirteen studies (4786 randomized participants) fulfilled eligibility criteria. VD supplementation significantly increased levels of serum 25(OH)D (mean difference = 15.97; 95% CI, 7.49–24.44; P = .002) and reduced incidence of repeat episodes of pneumonia (risk ratio <span>[RR]</span> = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50–0.93; P = .02). 

Subgroup analysis revealed VD supplementation had more reducing effects on repeat episodes of pneumonia among participants in trials in which the population were children 

* (RR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.90), duration <3 months (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33–0.91),

* or dose of VD <300,000 IU (RR = 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29–0.89). 

Although our results suggested that VD supplementation had a positive effect on recovery rate of pneumonia (RR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.94–1.74; I2 = 13%), there was no statistical difference (P = .12). 

High-dose VD intervention may have an effect on reducing the incidence rate of repeat episodes of pneumonia by enhancing immune efficacy, although more population studies are needed to support that VD supplementation has therapeutic effects on pneumonia itself.

#### Pneumonia elderly death 12X more likely when vitamin D less than 12 ng – 2011

 **Vitamin D, Innate Immunity and Outcomes in Community Acquired Pneumonia** 

1. Leong Leow1,    2. Talia Simpson3,    3. Ray Cursons3,    4. Noel Karalus1,    5. Robert J Hancox1,2,*

DOI: 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.01924.x

Background and objective  Vitamin D regulates the production of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin and beta defensin-2, which play an important role in the innate immune response to infection. We hypothesised that vitamin D deficiency would be associated with lower levels of these peptides and worse outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods  Associations between mortality and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, cathelicidin, and beta defensin-2 were investigated in a prospective cohort of 112 patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia during winter.

Results  Severe 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (<30nmol/L) was common in this population (15%) and was associated with a higher 30-day mortality compared to patients with sufficient 25-hydroxyvitamin D(>50nmol/L) (OR  **12.7** , 95%CI 2.2-73.3, p = 0.004). 

These associations were not explained by differences in age, co-morbidities, or the severity of the acute illness. 

Neither cathelicidin nor beta defensin-2 levels predicted mortality, although there was a trend towards increased mortality with lower cathelicidin (p = 0.09). 

Neither cathelicidin nor beta defensin-2 levels correlated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Conclusions  25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is associated with increased mortality in patients admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia during winter. 

Contrary to our hypothesis, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not associated with levels of cathelicidin or beta defensin-2.
