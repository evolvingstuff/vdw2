Background: Recent reports have shown that Vitamin D deficiency is rampant in tropical countries including India despite plenty of sunshine due to several factors. Ageing affects synthesis vitamin D. Post menopausal women are more vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency.

Aim: To determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and to find out its relation with possible cardiovascular risk among postmenopausal women.

Methods: The present cross-sectional survey was conducted among 270 postmenopausal women between age group of 45 to 70 years attending Gynecology Out Patient Department of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Each study subject was interviewed and vitamin D adequacy was evaluated by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Results:	Vitamin D deficiency was prevalent among 70.7% of study subjects, whereas only 10.0% had optimum vitamin-D level. Participants having high cholesterol level had low vitamin D level. An inverse relationship was observed between BMI and vitamin D level among study subjects.

Conclusion: The findings of the study highlight that vitamin D deficiency is an alarming issue among postmenopausal women in India. Health promotional measures could help them in maintaining optimum BMI as well as achieving the optimum vitamin D levels.
