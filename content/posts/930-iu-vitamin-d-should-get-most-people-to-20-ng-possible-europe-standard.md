The present study used a systematic review approach to identify relevant randomised control trials (RCT) with vitamin D and then apply meta-regression to explore the most appropriate model of the vitamin D intake-serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) relationship to underpin setting reference intake values. 

Methods included an updated structured search on Ovid MEDLINE; rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria; data extraction; and meta-regression (using different model constructs). 

In particular, priority was given to data from winter-based RCT performed at latitudes >49·5°N (n 12). 

A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log (Ln) total vitamin D intake (i.e. diet and supplemental vitamin D) v. achieved serum 25(OH)D in winter (that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee) produced a curvilinear relationship (mean (95 % lower CI) serum 25(OH)D (nmol/l) = 9·2 (8·5) Ln (total vitamin D)). 

Use of non-transformed total vitamin D intake data (maximum 1400 IU/d; 35 ?g/d) provided for a more linear relationship (mean serum 25(OH)D (nmol/l) = 0·044 × (total vitamin D)+33·035). 

Although inputting an intake of 600 IU/d (i.e. the RDA) into the 95 % lower CI curvilinear and linear models predicted a serum 25(OH)D of 54·4 and 55·2 nmol/l, respectively, the total vitamin D intake that would achieve 50 (and 40) nmol/l serum 25(OH)D was 359 (111) and 480 (260) IU/d, respectively. 

Inclusion of  **95 % range**  in the model to account for inter-individual variability increased the predicted intake of vitamin D needed to maintain serum 25(OH)D ? 50 nmol/l to 930 IU/d. 

The model used to describe the vitamin D intake-status relationship needs to be considered carefully when setting new reference intake values in the Europe.

## They appeared to not consider high risk groups such as: <a href="/posts/overweight" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 710">overweight</a>, <a href="/posts/dark-skin" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1064">dark skin</a>, <a href="/posts/pregnant" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 816">pregnant</a>

## A search of the paper failed to find: over-weight, obese, clothing,

They did mention  **pregnant** once: to say that the special needs during pregnancy was excluded from analysis

 **Elderly** : The authors referenced a paper showing 800 IU resulted in 20 ng of vitamin D - which as considered adequate

## 20 ng was not considered to be a healthy amount by ANY of the experts
