Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, prenatal 25(OH)D levels, race, and subsequent asthma or recurrent wheeze in offspring: Secondary analyses from the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial. 

J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2017;140(5):1423-9 e5.

This secondary analysis of the VDAART study is the first to show that the effect of prenatal supplementation with vitamin D on asthma and recurrent wheeze is modified by the initial maternal level of circulating vitamin D early in pregnancy. This work suggests that having a higher vitamin D level at the beginning of pregnancy and maintaining the level throughout pregnancy maximizes the preventive effect of vitamin D on asthma and recurrent wheeze in offspring.
