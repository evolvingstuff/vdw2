Objective

This study investigated whether low vitamin D levels are independently associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of 5,634 COVID-19+ patients with recent Vitamin D labs receiving care at US Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) health care facilities from February 20, 2020 to November 8, 2020, was identified. Vitamin D level was ascertained using the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or D2 + D3 test result within 90 days preceding the index positive COVID-19 test. Study outcomes were: (1) inpatient hospitalization requiring isolation and (2) 30-day mortality among those hospitalized. Poisson Generalized Linear Models with robust errors and adjusted for sociodemographics and comorbidities were used to estimate outcome probabilities conditional on the log of Vitamin D levels.

Results

Of 5,634 veterans with a positive COVID-19 test, 707 (12.6%) were female, mean age was 62.5 (SD +/−15.1); 1,920 (34.1%) identified as non-White, and 623 (11.1%) as Latinx. Low vitamin D levels (<20 ng/ml) were found in 794 (14.1%) and 1,162 (20.6%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. After adjusting for all covariates, the probability of hospitalization was 23.7% for those with Vitamin D levels of 15ng/ml, but decreased to 19.8% for patients with higher vitamin D levels of 40 ng/ml, <span>[Adjusted Relative Risk (ARR) = 1.20 (1.06, 1.36, p = .004)]</span>. Among 1,162 hospitalized patients, 186 (16.0%) died within 30 days. The adjusted mortality rate for patients with Vitamin D levels of 15 ng/ml was 22.3% and decreased to 14.4% for patients with higher vitamin D levels of 40 ng/ml, <span>[ARR = 1.55 (1.11,2.18, p = .011)]</span>.

Conclusion

Vitamin D level may have a role in predicting COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality; larger trials are needed to determine if vitamin D supplementation improves COVID-19-related clinical outcomes.
