 **200,000 IU orally twice a month for 3 months ==> 82% had improvement in condition  
VitaminDWiki expect an even better response if:.had applied vitamin D directly to the scalp  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; approximatley 100X more gets to skin/scalp than if taken orally  
Also, no reduction in response due to poor gut, liver when taken topically**

   * Would be really good to activate the vitamin D receptors with resveratrol, etc.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of telogen effluvium (TE) and to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D in the treatment of this problem in women belonging to various cities of south Punjab, Pakistan. In the present study, 40 adult women suffering from the problem of TE were included.

Each woman was treated with oral vitamin D3 (200,000 IU) therapy fortnightly and a total of 6 doses were given to each patient. After 15 d of the last dose, the condition of patients was assessed clinically. The mean age of female patients was 32.2±1.5 y, 42.5% of the patients between 21-30 y of age were found to be more frequently affected with TE compared to 35% females of 31-40 y of age. Results showed significant improvement in hair growth in young (r=0.457 p<0.003) women and in those, which do not use sunscreen (r=-0.331 p<0.037) but commonly utilize milk or milk protein (r=-0.311 p<0.051). Vitamin D3 therapy resulted in the improvement of the condition in  **82.5%**  (p<0.001) patients of TE. The use of oral vitamin D3 (200,000 IU, fortnightly) for 3 mo resulted in significant improvement in hair regrowth in the patient of TE. Results showed improvement in hair growth in young women those do not use sunscreen but commonly utilize milk or milk protein.
