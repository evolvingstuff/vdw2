#### Why Do So Many Mental Illnesses Overlap?

 **[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-so-many-mental-illnesses-overlap/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pocket_hits&amp;utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-SPONSORED&amp;THEPENNYHOARDER-2024_03_05=&amp;sponsored=0&amp;position=3&amp;category=fascinating_stories&amp;scheduled_corpus_item_id=047119ee-9e82-4970-bd07-9fbb9d04a7c0&amp;url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-so-many-mental-illnesses-overlap/%20)** 

“If one person, say, has a diagnosis of schizophrenia in their family, not only are other people in the extended family more likely to have diagnosis of schizophrenia but they are also more likely to have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, autism or major depression,”

* “Individuals with mental disorders [often have symptoms of many different conditions](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/roots-of-mental-illness/), either simultaneously or at different times in their lives. What’s more, as the family patterns suggest, the genes linked with these conditions overlap.”

*  **Changing mental health problems over a lifetime**  found that people who are diagnosed with a mental health disorder often see that diagnosis changed some years later. A substance use disorder may remit and give way to depression, for example, only to later return as depression is replaced by severe anxiety, “

* “The first such studies of psychiatric disorders, published about 15 years ago, showed that many of the specific versions of genes associated with  **bipolar disorder**  were the same as those associated with __schizophrenia_. “These things that we think are distinct, most notably bipolar and schizophrenia, are not at all distinct,”

* “Since then researchers have followed suit for almost all the other major psychiatric disorders—including ADHD, PTSD, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—and found a number of genes common to all of them.”

* Study of 1.5 million Danes found ”depression, anorexia, autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia . . .”genetic variants that were common to these conditions that had roles in fetal neurodevelopment” 

   * (perhaps low vitamin D)

!!!!Why Do So Many Mental Illnesses Overlap?
__[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-so-many-mental-illnesses-overlap/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pocket_hits&amp;utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-SPONSORED&amp;THEPENNYHOARDER-2024_03_05=&amp;sponsored=0&amp;position=3&amp;category=fascinating_stories&amp;scheduled_corpus_item_id=047119ee-9e82-4970-bd07-9fbb9d04a7c0&amp;url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-so-many-mental-illnesses-overlap/ |Scientific American]__
“If one person, say, has a diagnosis of schizophrenia in their family, not only are other people in the extended family more likely to have diagnosis of schizophrenia but they are also more likely to have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, autism or major depression,”
*“Individuals with mental disorders [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/roots-of-mental-illness/|often have symptoms of many different conditions], either simultaneously or at different times in their lives. What’s more, as the family patterns suggest, the genes linked with these conditions overlap.”
*__Changing mental health problems over a lifetime__ found that people who are diagnosed with a mental health disorder often see that diagnosis changed some years later. A substance use disorder may remit and give way to depression, for example, only to later return as depression is replaced by severe anxiety, “
*“The first such studies of psychiatric disorders, published about 15 years ago, showed that many of the specific versions of genes associated with __bipolar disorder__ were the same as those associated with __schizophrenia_. “These things that we think are distinct, most notably bipolar and schizophrenia, are not at all distinct,”
*“Since then researchers have followed suit for almost all the other major psychiatric disorders—including ADHD, PTSD, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—and found a number of genes common to all of them.”
*Study of 1.5 million Danes found ”depression, anorexia, autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia . . .”genetic variants that were common to these conditions that had roles in fetal neurodevelopment” 
**(perhaps low vitamin D)

*__((Mental health of children: vast majority of studies reviewed found that vitamin D helped – March 2021))__

!!!!VitaminDWiki - ((Overview Schizophrenia and Vitamin D)) contains
14 reasons to think that schizophrenia is associated with low vitamin D
1) 97% of patients with schizophrenia are vitamin D deficient
2) Schizophrenia varies with latitude (UVB) by 10X (controversy)
3) Schizophrenia is more common in those with dark skin (when away from the equator)
4) Schizophrenia is associated with low natal vitamin D
5) Schizophrenia has been increasing around the world when vitamin D has been decreasing (controversy)
6) Schizophrenia is associated with low birth rate, which is associated with low vitamin D
7) Schizophrenia is associated with Autism which is associated with low vitamin D
8) Schizophrenia Bulletin Editorial (Jan 2014) speculated that Vitamin D could be a major player
9) Schizophrenia 2X more likely if low vitamin D - meta-analysis
10) Schizophrenia increased 40 % for Spring births after Danes stopped vitamin D fortification
11) Schizophrenia is associated with season of birth
12) Schizophrenia is associated with poor Vitamin D Receptor genes
13) Schizophrenia risk is decreased if give Vitamin D after birth
14) Schizophrenia symptoms reduced when Vitamin D levels are restored
