 **Ischemic Stroke:**  This type of stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain, reducing blood flow. It can be caused by thrombosis (a clot forming in the brain artery) or embolism (a clot traveling from another part of the body to the brain).

 **Hemorrhagic Stroke:**  This occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, leading to bleeding in or around the brain. It can be caused by high blood pressure, aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations.

Background

Ischemic stroke, characterized by the obstruction of blood flow to the brain, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The severity of ischemic stroke is commonly assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which helps predict patient outcomes. Recent research suggests a potential link between low vitamin D levels and an increased risk of cerebrovascular events, including ischemic stroke. However, the specific relationship between vitamin D deficiency and stroke severity remains underexplored.

Objectives

The study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and NIHSS scores in patients with ischemic stroke to determine whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of neurological deficits in these patients.

Materials and methods

This prospective observational study was conducted at Saveetha Medical College, Chennai, and involved 86 patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years, a confirmed diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke by neuroimaging, and presentation within 24 hours of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria included hemorrhagic stroke, conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism, and current vitamin D supplementation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and NIHSS scores were assessed within 24 hours of admission. Statistical analyses included Pearson’s correlation and multivariate linear regression to adjust for confounding variables.

Results

The study found that lower serum 25(OH)D levels were correlated with higher severity of stroke symptoms, as indicated by a significant negative correlation between 25(OH)D levels and NIHSS scores at admission (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.4081, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed this association (p = -0.3994, p < 0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. In addition, age (p = 0.1123, p = 0.009) and comorbid conditions (p = 0.9565, p = 0.008) were significantly associated with higher NIHSS scores.

Conclusion

The study demonstrates a significant negative correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and ischemic stroke severity, suggesting that higher vitamin D levels may be associated with less severe strokes. Further research is needed to explore the mechanistic pathways and therapeutic potential of vitamin D in stroke management. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels could be crucial for potentially reducing stroke severity and improving patient outcomes.

#### Ischemic Stroke is 18% more likely if poor Vitamin D genes (unless take more Vitamin D) – Feb 2024

 **Causal effect of serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration on cardioembolic stroke: Evidence from two-sample Mendelian randomization** 

Nutrition, Metabolism, and Cardiovascular Disease :[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2024.02.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2024.02.013)

 **It seems that there are two groups of genes** 

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/stroke-bimodal-bars.png" alt="image" width="500">

 **Highlights** 

* Genetically predicted serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with the risk of cardioembolic stroke.

* Mendelian Randomization analysis provides suggestive evidence that increased 25(OH)D levels may play a protective role in the development of cardioembolic stroke.

* Determining the role of 25(OH)D in stroke subtypes may be beneficial for the prevention of cardioembolic strokes.

Background and aims

The putative association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <span>[25(OH)D]</span> and the risk of cardioembolic stroke (CES) has been examined in observational studies, which indicate controversial findings. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine the causal relationship of serum 25(OH)D with the risk of CES.

Methods and results

The summary statistics dataset on the genetic variants related to 25(OH)D was used from the published GWAS of European descent participants in the UK Biobank, including 417,580 subjects, yielding 143 independent loci in 112 1-Mb regions. GWAS summary data of CES was obtained from GIGASTROKE Consortium, which included European individuals (10,804 cases, 1,234,808 controls). Our results unveiled a causal relationship between 25(OH)D and CES using IVW <span>[OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.67–0.98, p = 0.037]</span>. Horizontal pleiotropy was not seen <span>[MR-Egger intercept = 0.001; p = 0.792]</span>, suggesting an absence of horizontal pleiotropy. Cochrane's Q <span>[Q = 78.71, p-value = 0.924]</span>, Rucker's Q <span>[Q = 78.64, p-value = 0.913]</span>, and I2 = 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0%, 24.6%) statistic suggested no heterogeneity. This result remained consistent using different MR methods and sensitivity analyses, including Maximum likelihood <span>[OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.67–0.98, p-value = 0.036]</span>, Constrained maximum likelihood <span>[OR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.64–0.90, p-value = 0.002]</span>, Debiased inverse-variance weighted <span>[OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.68–0.99, p-value = 0.002]</span>, MR-PRESSO <span>[OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.77–0.87, p-value = 0.022]</span>, RAPS <span>[OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.67–0.98, p-value = 0.038]</span>, MR-Lasso <span>[OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.68–0.99, p-value = 0.037]</span>.

Conclusion

Our MR analysis provides suggestive evidence that increased 25(OH)D levels may play a protective role in the development of cardioembolic stroke. Determining the role of 25(OH)D in stroke subtypes has important clinical and public health implications.

In addition, age (p = 0.1123, p = 0.009) and comorbid conditions (p = 0.9565, p = 0.008) were significantly associated with higher NIHSS scores.\n\nConclusion\nThe study demonstrates a significant negative correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and ischemic stroke severity, suggesting that higher vitamin D levels may be associated with less severe strokes. Further research is needed to explore the mechanistic pathways and therapeutic potential of vitamin D in stroke management. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels could be crucial for potentially reducing stroke severity and improving patient outcomes.\n`├── FontNode

__Ischemic Stroke:__ This type of stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks or narrows an artery leading to the brain, reducing blood flow. It can be caused by thrombosis (a clot forming in the brain artery) or embolism (a clot traveling from another part of the body to the brain).
__Hemorrhagic Stroke:__ This occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, leading to bleeding in or around the brain. It can be caused by high blood pressure, aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations.{FONT}

__Stroke 2X less severe if sufficient Vitamin D%%%Stroke perhaps 4X less severe if optimal vitamin D__
{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21762&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;}
Background
Ischemic stroke, characterized by the obstruction of blood flow to the brain, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The severity of ischemic stroke is commonly assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which helps predict patient outcomes. Recent research suggests a potential link between low vitamin D levels and an increased risk of cerebrovascular events, including ischemic stroke. However, the specific relationship between vitamin D deficiency and stroke severity remains underexplored.

Objectives
The study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and NIHSS scores in patients with ischemic stroke to determine whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the severity of neurological deficits in these patients.

Materials and methods
This prospective observational study was conducted at Saveetha Medical College, Chennai, and involved 86 patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. Inclusion criteria were age &gt;18 years, a confirmed diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke by neuroimaging, and presentation within 24 hours of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria included hemorrhagic stroke, conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism, and current vitamin D supplementation. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and NIHSS scores were assessed within 24 hours of admission. Statistical analyses included Pearson’s correlation and multivariate linear regression to adjust for confounding variables.

Results
The study found that lower serum 25(OH)D levels were correlated with higher severity of stroke symptoms, as indicated by a significant negative correlation between 25(OH)D levels and NIHSS scores at admission (Pearson correlation coefficient r = -0.4081, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed this association (p = -0.3994, p &lt; 0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, with p &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. In addition, age (p = 0.1123, p = 0.009) and comorbid conditions (p = 0.9565, p = 0.008) were significantly associated with higher NIHSS scores.

Conclusion
The study demonstrates a significant negative correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and ischemic stroke severity, suggesting that higher vitamin D levels may be associated with less severe strokes. Further research is needed to explore the mechanistic pathways and therapeutic potential of vitamin D in stroke management. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels could be crucial for potentially reducing stroke severity and improving patient outcomes.

{img type=&quot;attId&quot; attId=&quot;21006&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;}

__Highlights__
*Genetically predicted serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with the risk of cardioembolic stroke.
*Mendelian Randomization analysis provides suggestive evidence that increased 25(OH)D levels may play a protective role in the development of cardioembolic stroke.
*Determining the role of 25(OH)D in stroke subtypes may be beneficial for the prevention of cardioembolic strokes.
Background and aims
The putative association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [25(OH)D] and the risk of cardioembolic stroke (CES) has been examined in observational studies, which indicate controversial findings. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine the causal relationship of serum 25(OH)D with the risk of CES.

Methods and results
The summary statistics dataset on the genetic variants related to 25(OH)D was used from the published GWAS of European descent participants in the UK Biobank, including 417,580 subjects, yielding 143 independent loci in 112 1-Mb regions. GWAS summary data of CES was obtained from GIGASTROKE Consortium, which included European individuals (10,804 cases, 1,234,808 controls). Our results unveiled a causal relationship between 25(OH)D and CES using IVW [OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.67–0.98, p = 0.037]. Horizontal pleiotropy was not seen [MR-Egger intercept = 0.001; p = 0.792], suggesting an absence of horizontal pleiotropy. Cochrane&#39;s Q [Q = 78.71, p-value = 0.924], Rucker&#39;s Q [Q = 78.64, p-value = 0.913], and I2 = 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0%, 24.6%) statistic suggested no heterogeneity. This result remained consistent using different MR methods and sensitivity analyses, including Maximum likelihood [OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.67–0.98, p-value = 0.036], Constrained maximum likelihood [OR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.64–0.90, p-value = 0.002], Debiased inverse-variance weighted [OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.68–0.99, p-value = 0.002], MR-PRESSO [OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.77–0.87, p-value = 0.022], RAPS [OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.67–0.98, p-value = 0.038], MR-Lasso [OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.68–0.99, p-value = 0.037].

Conclusion
Our MR analysis provides suggestive evidence that increased 25(OH)D levels may play a protective role in the development of cardioembolic stroke. Determining the role of 25(OH)D in stroke subtypes has important clinical and public health implications.
