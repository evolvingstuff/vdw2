Objectves: To investigate the influence of targeted serum vitamin-D level and omega-6:3 fatty-acid ratio on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance by providing a nutritional intervention and vitamin supplementation.

Methods: Sixty-eight patients with biopsy-proven NCCN very-low or low-risk prostate cancer were enrolled in the prostate cancer nutrition and genetics clinic at the Cleveland Clinic from  **July 2013-December 2019** . Patients adhered to a specific dietary regimen devoid of animal-based products and foods containing omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The supplement regimen consisted of: Omega-3 PUFAs 720mg (three/day); curcumin 2000 mg/day; vitamin D3 dose titrated to achieve serum level of 60 ng/ml; and vitamin B-complex 1000 mg (four times weekly). Patients underwent periodic monitoring of PSA, serum vitamin D, and PUFA levels and had frequent follow-up with the nutritionist which included a food frequency questionnaire. Interval prostate biopsy was performed as clinically indicated and/or at nine months.

Results: The mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) of PSA slope and Vitamin D serum levels slope were 0.11 (0-0.25) ng/mL/month and 4.65 (3.09-5.98) ng/mL/month, respectively. Patients with higher initial vitamin D levels were twice as likely to have a  **downward PSA trend (OR=2.04** , 95% CI 1.04-4.01, p=0.04).  **Fifty-five patients underwent follow-up biopsy, all showing no progression of disease** . Three patients had loose bowel movements that required omega-3 and or curcumin dose adjustments.

Conclusions: Intensive nutritional intervention with Vitamin D and Omega-3 PUFA supplementation may benefit men on active surveillance for prostate cancer and further studies are warranted.
