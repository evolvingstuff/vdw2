Background: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess whether low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level is associated with susceptibility to COVID-19, severity, and mortality related to COVID-19.

Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Scopus, and Embase database up until 9 December 2020. We include published observational prospective and retrospective studies with information on 25-OHD that reported main/secondary outcome. Low serum 25-OHD refers to participants with serum 25-OHD level below a cut-off point ranging from 20 to 30 ng/mL. Other cut-off values were excluded to reduce heterogeneity. The main outcome was mortality defined as non-survivor/death. The secondary outcome was susceptibility and severe COVID-19.

Results: There were 14 studies comprising of 999,179 participants. Low serum 25-OHD was associated with 

* higher rate of COVID-19 infection compared to the control group (OR = 2.71 <span>[1.72, 4.29]</span>, p < 0.001; I2: 92.6%). 

* Higher rate of  **severe**  COVID-19 was observed in patients with low serum 25-OHD ( **OR = 1.90**  <span>[1.24, 2.93]</span>, p = 0.003; I2: 55.3%), with a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 39%, PLR of 1.4, NLR of 0.43, and DOR of 3. 

* Low serum 25-OHD was associated with higher mortality ( **OR = 3.08**  <span>[1.35, 7.00]</span>, p = 0.011; I2: 80.3%), with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 35%, PLR of 1.3, NLR of 0.44, and DOR of 3. 

Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between low serum 25-OHD and mortality was affected by male gender (OR = 1.22 <span>[1.08, 1.39]</span>, p = 0.002), diabetes (OR = 0.88 <span>[0.79, 0.98]</span>, p = 0.019).

Conclusion: Low serum 25-OHD level was associated with COVID-19 infection, severe presentation, and mortality.
