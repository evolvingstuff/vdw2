The objective of this study was to determine whether administration of vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day would improve absorption and increase serum levels of 25(OH)D. This was a prospective cohort study in an ambulatory tertiary-care referral center. Patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation Bone Clinic for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency who were not responding to treatment make up the study group. Subjects were instructed to take their usual vitamin D supplement with the largest meal of the day. The main outcome measure was the serum 259(OH)D level after 2 to 3 months.</p><p>Seventeen patients were analyzed. The mean age (±SD) and sex (F/M) ratio were 64.5 ± 11.0 years and 13 females and 4 males, respectively.</p><p>The dose of 25(OH)D ranged from 1000 to 50,000 IU daily.</p><p>The mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level (±SD) was 30.5 ± 4.7 ng/mL (range 21.6 to 38.8 ng/mL). The mean serum 25(OH)D level after diet modification (±SD) was 47.2 ± 10.9 ng/mL (range 34.7 to 74.0 ng/mL, p &lt; .01).</p><p>Overall, the average serum 25(OH)D level increased by 56.7% ± 36.7%.</p><p>A subgroup analysis based on the weekly dose of vitamin D was performed, and a similar trend was observed.</p><p>Thus it is concluded that taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in about a 50% increase in serum levels of 25(OH)D levels achieved. Similar increases were observed in a wide range of vitamin D doses taken for a variety of medical conditions. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research</p><p>Received: 30 October 2009; Revised: 14 December 2009; Accepted: 4 February 2010</p><hr><h4 id=99-citations-of-this-study-as-of--oct-2023>99 citations of this study as of Oct 2023</h4><p><strong><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3964965760747432440&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=take-your-vitamin-d-at-dinner-youll-increase-absorption-and-boost-your-vitamin-d-levels-by-50>Take Your Vitamin D at Dinner!

Angelo Licata, MD, PhD. and Guy B. Mulligan, MD., Cleveland Clinic Foundation Metabolic Bone Clinic, &ldquo;Taking vitamin D with the largest meal improves absorption and results in higher serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D&rdquo;, J Bone Miner Res Feb. 8, 2010 (ahead of print)-</p><p>OK, we all know by now how important it is to raise our vitamin D levels to &ldquo;optimally&rdquo; around 50 ng/mL&ndash;or at the very least to 32 ng/mL. If you need a refresher in the importance of vitamin D, click here, here, and here.</p><p>But guess what? It&rsquo;s easier said than done. I, for one, have found out how slowly those levels really do rise. So what&rsquo;s a person to do&ndash;especially if you aren&rsquo;t able to get out into the sun 3 times a week?</p><p>All I can say is, &ldquo;Thank you Dr. Angelo Licata for devising this simple, straightforward research project that&rsquo;s provided an answer for all of us! From now on, I&rsquo;m taking my vitamin D with my dinner. No more taking it on an empty stomach, on the fly, in between meals!&rdquo;</p><p>Licata and Mulligan figured that since vitamin D is fat-soluble, absorption just might improve if patients took their supplements with their largest meal of the day! How simple is that? See the <a href=http://www.happyhealthylonglife.com/happy_healthy_long_life/2010/03/olive-oil.html>Iowa State</a> salad dressing/vitamin absorption study</p><p>Who participated in this study? There were 17 patients, a mix of men & women, with an average age of 64.5, and an average 25OHD level of 30.5. All were being seen at the clinic for vitamin D deficiency, and they were selected for this study because they were unable to achieve adequate increases in their vitamin D levels despite taking vitamin D supplements. Turns out, all of these patients were taking their vitamin D either on an empty stomach, or with a small meal, usually breakfast or lunch.</p><p>This was great mix of patients. Because of different factors, some were on &ldquo;average&rdquo; doses of vitamin D, and some were on megadoses. Some were taking D2. Some were taking D3. Some were taking an oil preparation. Some were taking a solid preparation. And all were having difficulty getting their levels up to optimal levels.</p><ul><li><p>One group was taking about 1,400 IUs of vitamin D3 (either oil or solid capsule) a day, with a baseline 25OHD averaging 28.9</p></li><li><p>One group was taking 50,000 IUs of vitamin D2 (oil preparation) per week with a baseline 25OHD averaging 31.3</p></li><li><p>One small group of 3 was taking >50,000 (average dose of 183,333 IUs a week) IUs of vitamin D2 (an oil preparation) per week with a baseline 25OHD averaging 32.4</p></li></ul><p>What were the participants asked to do? All 17 participants were told to keep taking their usual vitamin D supplement, but take it with their largest meal of the day, usually dinner.</p><p><strong>And the envelope, please.</strong></p><p>After 2-3 months the participants had their 25OHD levels measured, and everyone ended up with an amazing average increase of around 50% over baseline in their vitamin D levels.</p><ul><li><p>The 1,400 IUs of D3 folks went from 28.9 before to 45.4 ng/mL after.</p></li><li><p>The 50,000 IUs of D2 folks went from 31.3 before to 48.3 ng/mL after.</p></li><li><p>The >50,000 IUs of D2 folks went from 32.4 to 48.7 ng/mL after.</p></li></ul><p>Big point: the type of vitamin D preparation taken made no difference-whether it was D2 or D3-oil or solid.</p><p>All three groups achieved increases over baseline of around 50%.</p><p>Why concerns about taking high doses of vitamin D are unfounded. Why a Doctors&rsquo; Care is Critical.</p><p>According to Drs. Licata and Mulligan, some patients clearly require very large doses of vitamin D to achieve a mid-range level.</p><p>They recognize that many physicians are concerned about vitamin D toxicity at such high levels.</p><p>&ldquo;However, it is not the dose prescribed alone which should be considered, but how much is actually absorbed.</p><p>Some patients require very large doses to achieve mid-normal levels. Monitoring the serum level is critical.</p><p>A recent study (click here) indicates that serum concentrations of 25OHD only in the high-normal reference interval prevents non-vertebral fracture. (normal range: 31-80 ng/ML)</p><p>Hence, striving to achieve this level (i.e. ~50 ng/mL) may be optimal, rather than a level at the low-end of the normal range.&rdquo;</p><p>Thoughts about Citracal: In light of Dr. Licata&rsquo;s study, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how many women depend upon getting their vitamin D from Citracal&ndash;the calcium/vitamin D capsule that prides itself on being easy-to-take-and-absorbable on an empty stomach!</p><p>Limitations to the study: This study was small, there wasn&rsquo;t a control group, and there wasn&rsquo;t a way for the researchers to &ldquo;know exactly how the patients took their supplements.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But despite of these limitations, &ldquo;the results are striking, and consistent across a heterogeneous group of patients (ie different disease states and different preparations and doses of vitamin D).</p><p>It therefore seems reasonable to ask patients to take vitamin D supplements with their largest meal, as it may be a cost-effective strategy that could very well help patients achieve optimal serum levels of 25OHD.”</p><img src=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/gif/vit-d-with-big-meal.gif alt=image><h4 id=click-spantiki-download_filephpfileid1180span-for-full-article>click <span>[tiki-download_file.php?fileId=1180]</span> for full article</h4><hr><h4 id=a-few-of-the-103-studies-cited-this-paper-as-of-jan-2024httpsscholargooglecomscholarcites3964965760747432440as_sdt548sciodt048hlen><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3964965760747432440&amp;as_sdt=5,48&amp;sciodt=0,48&amp;hl=en">a few of the 103 studies cited this paper as of Jan 2024</a></h4><ul><li><p>Factors affecting 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in response to vitamin D supplementation - 2015</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D bioavailability: state of the art - 2015</p></li><li><p>Type of Dietary Fat Is Associated with the 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Increment in Response to Vitamin D Supplementation - 2011</p></li><li><p>Effect of high-versus low-fat meal on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels after a single oral dose of vitamin D: a single-blind, parallel, randomized trial - 2011</p></li><li><p>Meal conditions affect the absorption of supplemental vitamin D3 but not the plasma 25‐hydroxyvitamin D response to supplementation - 2013</p></li><li><p>Factors influencing the absorption of vitamin D in GIT: an overview - 2017</p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>About D - more info.</span>
