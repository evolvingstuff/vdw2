# Questions asked - [CLICK HERE](http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/short/57/9/1227?rss=1) for answers

What should we measure: 25-OHD3, 25-OHD2, both, or 1,25-OHD?

Is there a preferred assay for the measurement of vitamin D metabolites?

How stable are 25-OHD and 1,25-OHD during transport?

What are the clinical indications for measurement of 25-OHD in disorders of bone and mineral metabolism, or other situations?

What reference ranges should be used for reporting 25-OHD results, and should they be stratified by sex, ethnicity, age, and season?

How important are sunscreens and sun hats in regulating synthesis of vitamin D?

How valid are the epidemiologic data relating vitamin D to diseases outside the skeleton?

What are the mechanisms controlling 1,25-OHD production outside the kidney?

Is there a role for determining polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor (VDR)?

In an era of shrinking resources in healthcare and given the existing clinical and population studies, do you support the measurement of vitamin D in general practice in subjects with no clinical signs or suspicion of bone disease?
