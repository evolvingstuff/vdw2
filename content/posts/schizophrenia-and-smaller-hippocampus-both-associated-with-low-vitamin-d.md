 **Highlights** 

•Vitamin D deficiency might be one of the contributing factors in schizophrenia pathogenesis.

•Hippocampal abnormalities are established in schizophrenia.

•Hippocampus expresses high levels of vitamin D receptors.

•Serum vitamin D level correlated positively with hippocampus volume in schizophrenia patients.

Disparate lines of evidence including epidemiological and case-control studies have increasingly implicated vitamin D in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to dysfunction of the hippocampus – a brain region hypothesized to be critically involved in schizophrenia. In this study, we examined for potential association between serum vitamin D level and hippocampal gray matter volume in antipsychotic-naïve or antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients (n=35). Serum vitamin D level was estimated using 25-OH vitamin D immunoassay. Optimized voxel-based morphometry was used to analyse 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1-mm slice thickness). 

 **Ninety-seven percent of the schizophrenia patients (n=34) had sub-optimal levels of serum vitamin D**  (83%, deficiency; 14%, insufficiency). A significant positive correlation was seen between vitamin D and regional gray matter volume in the right hippocampus after controlling for age, years of education and total intracranial volume (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates: x=35, y=−18, z=−8; t=4.34 pFWE-Corrected=0.018). These observations support a potential role of vitamin D deficiency in mediating hippocampal volume deficits, possibly through neurotrophic, neuroimmunomodulatory and glutamatergic effects.
