#### Preeemies need Vitamin D as soon as possible - March 2025

 **Vitamin D: What We Know and What We Still Do Not Know About Vitamin D in Preterm Infants—A Literature Review** 

Children 2025, 12(3), 392; https://doi.org/10.3390/children12030392

Background/Objectives: Preterm infants represent a population group at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and for its negative impact on various outcomes like metabolic bone disease or rickets, respiratory complications like respiratory distress syndrome and the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, or retinopathy of prematurity. 

Methods: Despite the growing interest in vitamin D research, there is still uncertainty regarding clear recommendations for each high-risk category of premature infants concerning the optimal dosage, optimal product, and timing for initiating vitamin D supplementation to prevent VDD. 

Results: An analysis of the literature suggests that  **early intervention**  for the optimal enteral supplementation of vitamin D is not only successful in achieving higher 25-hydroxi-vitamin D (25(OH)D) at one month but is also linked with improved outcomes. 

Conclusions: The traditional concepts and current recommendations for assessing vitamin D status and optimal supplementation need to be revised. Since parenteral nutrition, fortified mothers’ own milk, and special formula for preterm infants cannot provide adequate vitamin D levels, initiating oral supplementation soon after birth is essential to correct VDD in preterm infants.

#### Preterm infants given 800 IU of vitamin D daily a month after birth (too little, too late to help much) – Oct 2024

 **Effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25(OH)D3 levels and neurobehavioral development in premature infants after birth** 

Scientific Reports volume 14, Article number: 23972 (2024)

Hong Guo, Jianing Xie, Xiaoya Yu, Yuan Tian, Meiqi Guan & Jingjing Wei 

This study explored the factors influencing serum 25(OH)D3 levels and the effects of Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and VD supplementation on 25(OH)D3 levels and neuropsychobehavioral development in premature infants, to provide a theoretical basis for improving their prognosis. Physical examination, neuropsychobehavioral development and serum 25(OH)D3 levels were assessed regularly in 158 preterm infants supplemented with VD formulation. 25(OH)D3 levels were analyzed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after birth. The Gesell neuropsychological development test was conducted at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after birth to obtain the developmental quotient (DQ). Based on the serum 25(OH)D3 levels at 42 days of age, the infants were divided into VDD and non-VDD groups. Preterm infants in the VDD group were supplemented with more VD until their 25(OH)D3 levels were normal, and were divided into sustained VDD (SVDD) and corrected VDD (CVDD) groups according to serum 25(OH)D3 levels at 3 months of age. Appropriate statistical methods were chosen to compare differences in 25(OH)D3 and DQ between or among different groups, screen for the factors influencing 25(OH)D3 levels in preterm infants at 42 days of age, and analyze the relationship between 25(OH)D3 and DQ. The 25(OH)D3 levels of preterm infants at 42 days of age were positively correlated with VD supplementation during pregnancy, and before 42 days after birth (P < 0.05). The 25(OH)D3 levels in preterm infants at 42 days and 3 months of age were positively correlated with the DQ levels at 6, 9, 12, and 18 months of age (P < 0.05). The DQ level in the VDD group, especially SVDD group, was lower than that in CVDD and non-VDD groups at the same time point (P < 0.05). This research thus demonstrates that VD supplementations during pregnancy and after birth is a major factor affecting 25(OH)D3 levels in premature infants. Early VDD and SVDD can affect their neuropsychobehavioral development, and effective VD supplementation can gradually correct VDD and mitigate this influence.

#### Preterm birth 9 times more likely if low vitamin D in 2nd trimester (Lupus) – May 2023

 **Association Between 25-hydroxyvitamin D Levels and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus** 

Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken). 2025 Apr;77(4):432-439. [doi: 10.1002/acr.25440.](https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.25440.) behind paywall until March 2026

Nima Madanchi 1, Andrea Fava 1, Daniel W Goldman 1, Laurence S Magder 2, Michelle Petri 1

Objective: We evaluated the association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels with adverse pregnancy outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods: The Hopkins Lupus Cohort includes visits of pregnant patients, including assessment of 25(OH)D levels at each visit. We examined the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age). We also used a time-to-event analysis to assess whether time-varying of 25(OH)D levels were associated with time to miscarriage or preterm delivery.

Results: In subgroups of patients defined by the average of 25(OH)D levels, we observed significantly different risks of miscarriage (P = 0.0045), preterm delivery (P = 0.0007), and the composite measure of all three adverse pregnancy outcomes (P = 0.011). The highest risks were observed among those with the lowest or highest levels of vitamin D.  **Nine of 10 pregnant patients with low vitamin D levels during the second trimester resulted in having a premature delivery.**  The time-to-event model confirmed the same U-shaped association after adjustment for SLE disease activity; however, the increased risk among those with highest levels of vitamin D was not statistically significant. Body mass index did not appear to be a confounding factor.

Conclusion: Our study is not able to prove causation, but the results strongly suggest an association of 25(OH)D at both lower and higher levels with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We recommend the monitoring of maternal serum 25(OH)D levels during SLE pregnancies, aiming for the  **ideal range of 40 to 59 ng/mL** .

#### Preterm birth 7 times more likely if low vitamin D 1 month before – May 2023

 **Post-hoc Analysis of NICHD Vitamin D Pregnancy Cohort and The Role of Functional Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnancy** 

Am J Perinatol. 2023 May 22. [doi: 10.1055/a-2097-2098](https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2097-2098) PDF is behind paywall

Shellie Davis 1, Elliott Lyles 2, Judy Shary 3, Myla Ebeling 4, Susan G Reed 1, John E Baatz 1, Bruce W Hollis 3, Carol L Wagner 1

Objective: Conduct a secondary, post-hoc analysis of NICHD vitamin D (vitD) pregnancy study by Hollis et al. (Hollis, 2011), which reported on the effect of vitD supplementation in pregnant women, and determine the potential interaction between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations, vitD status, and various comorbidities associated with pregnancy.

Hypothesis: Women with low 25(OH)D concentrations and high iPTH concentrations during pregnancy, known as  **functional vitD deficiency (FVDD)** , were more likely to acquire complications also affecting their neonates.

Study design: This post-hoc analysis of data collected from a diverse group of pregnant women participating in the NICHD vitD pregnancy study, was applied to investigate the applicability of the concept of FVDD in pregnancy (Hemmingway, 2018) in identifying potential risks for certain comorbidities of pregnancy. This analysis defines FVDD as maternal serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 20 ng/mL and iPTH concentrations above 65 pg/mL creating a definitive ratio number, 0.308, to classify mothers as having FVDD prior to delivery (PTD). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

Results: 281 women (85 African American, 115 Hispanic, 81 Caucasian) with 25(OH)D and iPTH concentrations measured at monthly visits were included in this analysis. No statistically significant association was found between mothers classified as having FVDD at baseline or one-month PTD and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, infection, or admittance to the NICU. When combining all comorbidities of pregnancy in this cohort, results showed those with FVDD at baseline, 24 weeks' gestation, and one-month PTD were more likely to experience a comorbidity (p=0.001; p=0.001; p=0.004, respectively).

 **Those with FVDD one-month PTD were 7.1 times (CI 1.71-29.81) more likely to have preterm birth (<37 weeks)** than women without FVDD.

Conclusions: Participants were more likely to have experienced preterm birth if they met the criteria for FVDD. This study supports the importance of FVDD during pregnancy.

#### Preterm birth 1.53 X more likely if low vitamin D - May 2023

 **Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth: a nested case–control study** 

BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  Vol 23, article number 322, (2023)

Tashnia Tahsin, Rasheda Khanam, Nabidul Haque Chowdhury, A. S. M. Tarik Hasan, Md. Biplob Hosen, Sayedur Rahman, Anjan Kumar Roy, Salahuddin Ahmed, Rubhana Raqib & Abdullah H. Baqui 

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/ptb-factors.webp" alt="image" width="600">

Background

Each year, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm. Micronutrient deficiencies, including vitamin D deficiency (VDD), are common in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and these conditions are often associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Bangladesh experiences a high prevalence of VDD. The country also has a high preterm birth (PTB) rate. Using data from a population-based pregnancy cohort, we estimated the burden of VDD during pregnancy and its association with PTB.

Methods

Pregnant women (N = 3,000) were enrolled after ultrasound confirmation of gestational age at 8–19 weeks of gestation. Trained health workers prospectively collected phenotypic and epidemiological data at scheduled home visits. Trained phlebotomists collected maternal blood samples at enrollment and 24 -28 weeks of gestation. Aliquots of serum were stored at -80.0 C. We conducted a nested case–control study with all PTB (n = 262) and a random sample of term births (n = 668). The outcome, PTB, was defined as live births < 37 weeks of gestation, based on ultrasound. The main exposure was vitamin D concentrations of 24–28 weeks maternal blood samples. The analysis was adjusted for other PTB risk factors. Women were categorized as VDD (lowest quartile of 25(OH)D; <  = 30.25 nmol/L) or not deficient (upper-three quartiles of 25(OH)D; > 30.25 nmol/L). We used logistic regression to determine the association of VDD with PTB, adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

The median and interquartile range of serum 25(OH)D was 38.0 nmol/L; 30.18 to 48.52 (nmol/L). After adjusting for co-variates, VDD was significantly associated with PTB <span>[adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 – 2.12]</span>. 

 **The risk of PTB was also higher among women who were**  

* shorter (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.27–2.57), 

* primiparous (aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.12 – 2.12), 

* passive smokers (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.09 – 2.34), and those who 

* received  **iron supplementation**  during pregnancy (aOR =  **1.66** , 95% CI: 1.17, 2.37).

Conclusion

VDD is common in Bangladeshi pregnant women and is associated with an increased risk of PTB.

#### Global preterm birth rates 2010 - Lancet

 **National, regional, and worldwide estimates of preterm birth rates in the year 2010 with time trends since 1990 for selected countries: a systematic analysis and implications** 

Published:June 09, 2012 DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60820-4

<img src="https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/png/preterm-less-than-28-weeks.png" alt="image" width="900">

Background

Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth (<37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by UN agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.

Methods

We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during WHO's country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10 000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.

Findings

In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3–18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5% in several European countries to 18% in some African countries. More than 60% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, USA has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990–2010.

Interpretation

The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

#### Asked Chat-GPT: "What health problems do preemies have as adults?" (Dec 2023)

Premature babies, often referred to as "preemies," can face a range of health issues in adulthood, which are partly determined by the degree of prematurity and the medical complications they experienced as infants. Some of the common long-term health problems that preemies may encounter as adults include:

1.  **Respiratory Problems:**  Premature babies are at a higher risk for developing respiratory issues, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), because their lungs may not have fully developed before birth.

1.  **Cardiovascular Issues:**  Adults who were born prematurely may have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. This increased risk is thought to be related to the underdevelopment of the heart and vascular system in preemies.

1.  **Neurological Problems:**  Premature birth can affect brain development, leading to a higher risk of neurological disorders in adulthood, such as cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

1.  **Metabolic Disorders:**  Being born prematurely is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, in adulthood.

1.  **Visual and Hearing Impairments:**  Premature infants are at a higher risk for vision and hearing problems, which can persist into adulthood. Conditions like retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can lead to visual impairment.

1.  **Mental Health Issues:**  There is evidence suggesting that adults who were born prematurely may have an increased risk of mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.

1.  **Dental Problems:**  Preemies might face a higher risk of dental issues, including enamel hypoplasia (defective enamel), which can lead to an increased risk of cavities and other dental problems.

1.  **Reproductive Challenges:**  Women who were born prematurely may experience reproductive issues, such as a higher risk of giving birth prematurely themselves.

It's important to note that while preemies are at a higher risk for these health problems, not all premature babies will experience them. Advances in neonatal care have significantly improved the outcomes for premature babies, and many go on to lead healthy lives. Regular medical follow-up and a healthy lifestyle can help mitigate some of these risks.
