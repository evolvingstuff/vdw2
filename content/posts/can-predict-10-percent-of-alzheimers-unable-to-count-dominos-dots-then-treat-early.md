#### For some Alzheimer’s patients, vision problems may be an early warning

 **[A large study brings fresh attention to a lesser-known variant of the disease called posterior cortical atrophy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/01/23/alzheimers-disease-vision-problems-pca/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most ) Washington Post** 

* "That may change with the first large-scale international study of the condition, published Monday in the journal Lancet Neurology. An international team led by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco studied records of 1,092 PCA patients from 16 countries and found that, on average, the syndrome begins affecting patients at age 59 ― about five to six years earlier than most patients with the more common form of Alzheimer’s."

* "What little public attention PCA has received up to now was mainly due to British author and humanist  **Terry Pratchett** , who announced in December 2007 that he had been diagnosed with the syndrome.  %%%He pledged to donate $1 million to the Alzheimer’s Research Trust in the United Kingdom and collaborated with the BBC in 2009 on the two-part documentary “Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer’s.”

#### Speculate future: 1) App has you state # of dots, 2) If do poorly, get confirmation, 3) Do End of Alz treatments at home

Treatments to End Alzheimer's while at home have been available since the end of 2023.

I suspect that it is far easier to End Alzheimer's if it is caught early.

Treatment includes Vitamin D, Omega-3, diet change, etc.

#### Asked Chat-GPT: Which pre-alzheimer's symptoms could be detected by a smartphone app (Jan 2024)

The development of smartphone applications for health monitoring, including the detection of pre-Alzheimer's symptoms, has become increasingly sophisticated. Certain symptoms and changes associated with the early stages of Alzheimer's could potentially be monitored or detected by a smartphone app. These include:

Memory Changes: Apps can include memory games or tasks that are designed to test short-term and long-term memory. Changes in performance over time might indicate memory issues.

Speech and Language Patterns: Some apps can analyze speech patterns for signs of declining language skills, such as struggling to find the right words, repeating phrases, or deteriorating grammar.

Mood Changes: Smartphone apps can track mood changes through self-reported data. Unusual fluctuations in mood or increased symptoms of depression and anxiety might be early indicators.

Activity Levels and Social Engagement: Apps can monitor how often a person leaves the house or engages in social activities. A decline in these activities can be a sign of withdrawal, which is a common early symptom.

Sleep Patterns: Many smartphones and wearable devices can track sleep patterns. Changes in sleep, such as increased restlessness or difficulty staying asleep, can be early signs of cognitive changes.

Navigation and Spatial Orientation: Some apps can track how well a person navigates a familiar route or a new environment. Difficulty with navigation or getting lost in familiar places can be early signs of spatial orientation issues.

Cognitive Tasks Performance: There are apps specifically designed to test cognitive functions through various tasks and puzzles. These tasks can help in tracking the cognitive abilities over time.

Typing and Interaction Patterns: Smartphones can analyze typing speed, typing errors, and interaction patterns with the device. Changes in these metrics over time could indicate cognitive changes.

Voice and Sound Analysis: Advanced apps might use AI to analyze voice tone, pace, and other characteristics for signs of cognitive decline.

Self-Reported Symptoms and Behaviors: Apps often include features for users to self-report symptoms, behaviors, and other health-related data, which can be useful for tracking changes over time.

It's important to note that while these apps can provide valuable data and insights, they are not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. They should be used as supplementary tools, and any concerning findings should be followed up with a healthcare professional. Moreover, the accuracy and effectiveness of such apps can vary, and privacy concerns should be considered when using apps that collect personal health data.

Test reading, test color, test contrast, etc.

!!!!For some Alzheimer’s patients, vision problems may be an early warning
__[https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/01/23/alzheimers-disease-vision-problems-pca/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most |A large study brings fresh attention to a lesser-known variant of the disease called posterior cortical atrophy] Washington Post__
*&quot;That may change with the first large-scale international study of the condition, published Monday in the journal Lancet Neurology. An international team led by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco studied records of 1,092 PCA patients from 16 countries and found that, on average, the syndrome begins affecting patients at age 59 ― about five to six years earlier than most patients with the more common form of Alzheimer’s.&quot;
*&quot;What little public attention PCA has received up to now was mainly due to British author and humanist __Terry Pratchett__, who announced in December 2007 that he had been diagnosed with the syndrome.  %%%He pledged to donate $1 million to the Alzheimer’s Research Trust in the United Kingdom and collaborated with the BBC in 2009 on the two-part documentary “Terry Pratchett: Living With Alzheimer’s.”
*Many interesting reader&#39;s comments at the bottom of the Washington Post article

Treatments to End Alzheimer&#39;s while at home have been available since the end of 2023.
I suspect that it is far easier to End Alzheimer&#39;s if it is caught early.
Treatment includes Vitamin D, Omega-3, diet change, etc.

!!!!Asked Chat-GPT: Which pre-alzheimer&#39;s symptoms could be detected by a smartphone app (Jan 2024)
The development of smartphone applications for health monitoring, including the detection of pre-Alzheimer&#39;s symptoms, has become increasingly sophisticated. Certain symptoms and changes associated with the early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s could potentially be monitored or detected by a smartphone app. These include:

Memory Changes: Apps can include memory games or tasks that are designed to test short-term and long-term memory. Changes in performance over time might indicate memory issues.

Speech and Language Patterns: Some apps can analyze speech patterns for signs of declining language skills, such as struggling to find the right words, repeating phrases, or deteriorating grammar.

Mood Changes: Smartphone apps can track mood changes through self-reported data. Unusual fluctuations in mood or increased symptoms of depression and anxiety might be early indicators.

Activity Levels and Social Engagement: Apps can monitor how often a person leaves the house or engages in social activities. A decline in these activities can be a sign of withdrawal, which is a common early symptom.

Sleep Patterns: Many smartphones and wearable devices can track sleep patterns. Changes in sleep, such as increased restlessness or difficulty staying asleep, can be early signs of cognitive changes.

Navigation and Spatial Orientation: Some apps can track how well a person navigates a familiar route or a new environment. Difficulty with navigation or getting lost in familiar places can be early signs of spatial orientation issues.

Cognitive Tasks Performance: There are apps specifically designed to test cognitive functions through various tasks and puzzles. These tasks can help in tracking the cognitive abilities over time.

Typing and Interaction Patterns: Smartphones can analyze typing speed, typing errors, and interaction patterns with the device. Changes in these metrics over time could indicate cognitive changes.

Voice and Sound Analysis: Advanced apps might use AI to analyze voice tone, pace, and other characteristics for signs of cognitive decline.

Self-Reported Symptoms and Behaviors: Apps often include features for users to self-report symptoms, behaviors, and other health-related data, which can be useful for tracking changes over time.

It&#39;s important to note that while these apps can provide valuable data and insights, they are not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. They should be used as supplementary tools, and any concerning findings should be followed up with a healthcare professional. Moreover, the accuracy and effectiveness of such apps can vary, and privacy concerns should be considered when using apps that collect personal health data.
