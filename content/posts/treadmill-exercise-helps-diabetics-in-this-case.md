Background. Diabetes mellitus type 2 and vitamin D deficiency are both prevalent in the Saudi Arabia. Vitamin D deficiency treatment with supplements carries a risk of intoxication. Aim. The present study is aimed at elucidating the effect of exercise on modulation of metabolic status and vitamin D level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 

Methods. A sum of 110 type 2 diabetic patients were voluntarily enrolled for the present investigation by dividing them into two separate groups (55 individuals for each group), the diabetic study group and diabetic control group. The diabetic study group was engaged in the training program using treadmill exercise. Laboratory parameters were monitored before and after the training program. 

Results. There were significant elevation in the diabetic study group compared to diabetic control group regarding postexercise vitamin D level, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p value < 0.001, 0.045; respectively). In addition, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly decreased (p value < 0.001 for all mentioned parameters). Moreover, there were significant higher level in postexercise parameters as compared to preexercise level in the diabetic study group. 

Conclusion. The exercise training program improved the metabolic control and vitamin D level after three months of intervention.
