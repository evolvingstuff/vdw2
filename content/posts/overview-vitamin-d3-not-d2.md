Vitamin  **D2**  has been known for a long time to not be as good as vitamin  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>** 

Vitamin **D2**   was the first to be discovered and, until 2011, was the only one that most doctors could prescribe

The  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  form has been known for many decades, but the medical profession has not yet adapted - after all, only 12,000 papers on  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  asof Oct 2023.

Several recent studies have shown that vitamin  **D2**   actually  **reduces**  the levels of  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  in the blood

AND, worse still,  **D2**   actually  **INCREASES a health problem** , instead of reducing it, the way vitamin  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**  does

 **Notes:** 

Some multivitamins and milk/food fortifications still use  **D2** , but in such low quantities that it can be ignored.

Some people buy  **D2**  because it is vegan, being unaware that there are vegan forms of  **<span style="color:#00F;">D3</span>**
