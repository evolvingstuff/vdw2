#### Take a Stand: The Dangers of Prolonged Sitting

 **[Mercola Jan 7, 2023](https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/prolonged-sitting-risks) hour long video with &nbsp;<i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style="margin-right: 0.3em;"></i><a href="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/interview-drlevine-september2014-sitting-compresspdf.pdf">transcript </a>** 

* "There are about  **10,000 publications**  showing that prolonged sitting is harmful to your health and promotes chronic diseases, including obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Within 90 seconds of rising from sitting to standing, the muscular and cellular systems that process blood sugar, triglycerides and cholesterol — which are mediated by insulin — are activated. All of these molecular effects are activated simply by carrying your bodyweight upon your legs"

* "At bare minimum, avoid sitting for more than 50 minutes out of every hour. Ideally, limit sitting to three hours or less"

* "Evidence shows that prolonged sitting is devastating your health. In his book, “Get Up!: Why Your Chair Is Killing You and What You Can Do About It,” Dr. James Levine, co-director of the Mayo Clinic and the Arizona State University Obesity Initiative, notes there are about 10,000 publications showing that sitting is harmful to your health."

* "A study 6 published in 2015 found that, compared to those who exercised often and engaged in few sedentary behaviors, those who rarely exercised and spent many hours sitting had an almost  **eightfold increased risk of dying prematurely** ."
