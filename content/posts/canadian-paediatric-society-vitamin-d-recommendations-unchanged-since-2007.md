#### [Vitamin D supplementation: Recommendations for Canadian mothers and infants](http://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/vitamin-d%20)

The Canadian Paediatric Society, Posted: Oct 1 2007 | Reaffirmed: Jan 30 2017

They acknowledge that more studies are needed, but appear to have not made any changes

#### Examples of obsolete recommendations

* “Consideration should be given to administering 2000 IU of vitamin D daily to pregnant and lactating women, especially during the winter months, to maintain vitamin D sufficiency”

   * trials have found that 4,000 – 6,000 IU is needed

* “Total vitamin D intake from all sources for the premature infant should be 200 IU/kg/day to a maximum of 400 IU/day (recommendation grade A ).”

   * various groups around the world argue for 1,000 to 1,600 IU/day

* “To take advantage of cutaneous production of vitamin D, yet minimize possibility of skin damage, infants and children should be exposed to sunlight for short periods (probably less than 15 min/day) (recommendation grade B )”

   * 15 minutes might be enough if only wearing a diaper, in the summer, in the middle of the day,  in the summer, for a light-skinned infant/child, in the Southern portion of Canada, etc.
