Context: Systemic inflammation is thought to have a central role in diabetic long-term complications.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of vitamin D either with or without extra calcium on certain inflammatory biomarkers in the subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted over 12 wk in 90 T2D subjects aged 30–60 yr from both sexes.

Intervention: Subjects were randomly allocated to one of three groups to receive two 250-ml bottles a day of 

* plain Persian yogurt drink or doogh ( **PD** , containing 150 mg calcium and no detectable vitamin D3/250 ml), 

* vitamin D-fortified doogh ( **DD** , containing 500 IU vitamin D3 and 150 mg calcium/250 ml), or 

* calcium + vitamin D3-fortified doogh ( **CDD** , containing 500 IU vitamin D3 and 250 mg calcium/250 ml).

Outcome Measures: The changes in inflammatory markers were evaluated.

Results: Compared to the baseline values, highly sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-1?, IL-6, fibrinogen, and retinol binding protein-4 concentrations significantly decreased in both the DD and CDD groups. Although the decrement in highly sensitive C-reactive protein and fibrinogen was more in CDD compared to DD (?4.0 ± 8.5 vs. ?1.3 ± 2.8 mg/liter, and ?0.40 ± 0.74 and ?0.20 ± 0.52 mg/liter, respectively), the differences were not significant. 

There was a significant increase in serum adiponectin in both the DD and CDD groups (51.3 ± 65.3 vs. 57.1 ± 33.8 ?g/liter; P < 0.05). 

Mean adiponectin changes in CDD were significantly higher than in PD (P = 0.021).

Conclusions: Daily intake of vitamin D-fortified doogh improved inflammatory markers in T2D subjects, and extra calcium conferred additional benefit only for the antiinflammatory adipokine, i.e. adiponectin.
