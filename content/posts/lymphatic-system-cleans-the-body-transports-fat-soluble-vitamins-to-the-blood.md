#### Unlocking Your Body's Detox Potential: The Crucial Role of Lymphatics - Mercola Sept 2024

 **[Video interview and transcript](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2024/09/08/lymphatic-system.aspx?ui=d738e3df52a8a14aea9298fe6ec5bc113ed0d6d7922f31861727d54a43cbe29d&sd=20121119&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20240908_HL2&foDate=false&mid=DM1627027&rid=114198282)** 

* "Your lymphatic system is crucial for immune function, fluid balance and detoxification. It removes cellular waste, fights infections and aids in nutrient absorption. Proper lymphatic function is essential for overall health"

* "In our interview, Dr. Perry Nickelston recommends a "Big Six" lymphatic drainage technique, focusing on six primary areas in a specific order: collarbone, jaw, shoulder/armpit, abdomen, groin and behind your knee"

* "Lymph nodes cluster around major joints to facilitate movement-based drainage. Lack of movement and poor breathing lead to lymphatic stagnation, causing various health issues like inflammation and recurring infections"

* "Regular movement, including walking, rebounding and hanging exercises, is vital for lymphatic health. Combining lymphatic massage with other detox strategies like sauna use enhances overall effectiveness"

* "Lymphatic health is closely tied to cardiovascular and brain function. Addressing lymphatic stagnation helps with heart health, neurodegenerative diseases and chronic pain management by reducing inflammation and improving fluid dynamics"
