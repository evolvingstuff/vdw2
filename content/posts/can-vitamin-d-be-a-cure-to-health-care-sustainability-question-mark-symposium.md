#### [Press Release CALGARY, May 1, 2014 /CNW/](http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1347983/media-advisory-can-vitamin-d-be-a-cure-to-health-care-sustainability-ottawa-symposium%20)

Preventive health care has emerged as a potential solution to Canada's cash-strapped health-care system. Instead of absorbing costs associated with treating people that are sick, preventive care involves investing money to ensure people live healthier lives. One preventive strategy that has spurred serious debate is the use of Vitamin D. Uncertainty persists as to whether Canadians are getting enough Vitamin D and whether supplementation would lead to a healthier population.

Media are invited to an upcoming symposium devoted to assessing the merits of Vitamin D supplementation as a health intervention strategy. 

Health researchers from leading Canadian and US universities and public health officials from the FDA and Canadian governments will assemble to discuss and debate the latest research into this emerging health topic. 

Professor Herb Emery of The School of Public Policy will also summarize key findings of the event's proceedings at a media conference.
