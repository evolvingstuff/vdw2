Aims

The purpose of this study was to assess the evidence for an appropriate dose-response of vitamin D supplementation in patients with obesity with inadequate vitamin D serum levels.

Methods

We performed a systematic review consulting Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library up to September 2020 to identify studies that included (1) adult obese individuals with vitamin D serum levels below 75 nmol/l, (2) receiving cholecalciferol or calcidiol therapy (3) vitamin D serum levels assessment.

Results

The electronic search identified 705 potentially eligible studies, 11 of which were included and analysed. The heterogeneity of the studies did not permit a meta-analysis. Five studies (45.5%) were of high quality. Oral daily cholecalciferol resulted the route of administration that prevailed in most studies. We found that a minimum dose of =>2000UI/day might be needed to normalize 25OHD serum levels. Conversely, oral calcidiol <300IU/day failed to achieve 25OHD sufficiency.

Conclusions

Exposed evidence suggests that vitamin D requirements remain higher in patients with obesity compared to lean patients. In order to normalize 25OHD serum levels, patients taking cholecalciferol might need to triple the actual recommended vitamin D doses. In contrast, calcidiol doses are still to be clarified.
