## [Dr. Cannell highlights](http://blog.vitamindcouncil.org/2012/07/10/dear-dr-cannell-no-improvement-with-vitamin-d/%20)

* 7,000 IU for about 3 months ==>100 nanogram/ml

* Wonder if the child is taking too much Vitamin A (and thus blocking the use of the vitamin D)

* Dr. Cannel anticipates less likely to sunburn  with this high level of vitamin D

* Some parents reports it take many months to see an improvement

* ‘If he does not improve on vitamin D in six months, he will be the first autistic child I have tried to help who achieved 80 ng/ml for six months and did not improve.”

## Wonder if the child is low on the <a href="/posts/cofactors" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1270">cofactors</a> essential for use of vitamin D

such as  **Magnesium**
