Gave 50,000 IU of Vitamin D for 12 weeks

Most had a good response

The people with a poor response had a poor  Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio

 **Note:** 

* Any study will rarely consider even 4 of the above factors

* Factors are sometimes additive: example, 50% + 50% = 100%  = 2X as much Vitamin D is needed
