The clinical implications of low vitamin D in  **peripheral artery disease (PAD)**  are unknown. We hypothesized that among individuals with PAD, lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D would be associated with poorer functional performance, more adverse calf muscle characteristics, and poorer peripheral nerve function. 

Participants were 402 men and women with PAD who underwent measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (DiaSorin radioimmunoassay) along with 6-minute walk testing, measurement of walking velocity at usual and fastest pace, computed tomography-measured calf muscle density, and peripheral  **nerve conduction velocity (NCV)** . Among PAD participants, 20.4% had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 30 nmol/L, consistent with deficient vitamin D status. 

Adjusting for age, sex, and race, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were associated with poorer 6-minute walk performance (p trend = 0.002), slower usual-paced 4-meter walking velocity (p trend = 0.031), slower fast-paced 4-meter walking velocity (p trend = 0.043), and lower calf muscle density (p trend = 0.031). 

After additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and diabetes, none of these associations remained statistically significant. 

 **However** , lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were associated with poorer peroneal NCV (p trend = 0.013) and poorer sural NCV (p trend = 0.039), even after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, comorbidities, smoking, physical activity, and other confounders. 

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is common among people with PAD encountered in clinical settings. After adjusting for BMI and diabetes mellitus, we found no significant associations of lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with poorer functional performance or calf muscle characteristics. Associations of low vitamin D levels with poorer peripheral nerve function require further study.

### VitaminDWiki comment

Vitamin D deficiency in previous studies has been shown to be strongly associated with <a href="/posts/race" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1064">race</a>, [diabetes](/categories/diabetes) and <a href="/posts/high-bmi" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 710">high BMI</a>.

So, it is no surprise that after  **‘’adjusting’’** for those factors that no other association of PAD to vitamin D remained.

What is surprising was that any association remained – that of nerve conduction velocity, which affects how fast a person can react, say when off-balance. 

If the nerves are either 

* too slow to either announce the act of falling 

* or too slow to pass along the command to the muscles to react to the in-balance.

The person will be more likely to fall.

Many studies have found that <a href="/posts/adequate-vitamin-d-reduces-falling" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1260">adequate vitamin D reduces falling</a>.

The clinical implications of low vitamin D in __peripheral artery disease (PAD)__ are unknown. We hypothesized that among individuals with PAD, lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D would be associated with poorer functional performance, more adverse calf muscle characteristics, and poorer peripheral nerve function. 

Participants were 402 men and women with PAD who underwent measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (DiaSorin radioimmunoassay) along with 6-minute walk testing, measurement of walking velocity at usual and fastest pace, computed tomography-measured calf muscle density, and peripheral __nerve conduction velocity (NCV)__. Among PAD participants, 20.4% had 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &lt; 30 nmol/L, consistent with deficient vitamin D status. 

Adjusting for age, sex, and race, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were associated with poorer 6-minute walk performance (p trend = 0.002), slower usual-paced 4-meter walking velocity (p trend = 0.031), slower fast-paced 4-meter walking velocity (p trend = 0.043), and lower calf muscle density (p trend = 0.031). 

After additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and diabetes, none of these associations remained statistically significant. 

__However__, lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were associated with poorer peroneal NCV (p trend = 0.013) and poorer sural NCV (p trend = 0.039), even after adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, comorbidities, smoking, physical activity, and other confounders. 

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is common among people with PAD encountered in clinical settings. After adjusting for BMI and diabetes mellitus, we found no significant associations of lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with poorer functional performance or calf muscle characteristics. Associations of low vitamin D levels with poorer peripheral nerve function require further study.

!!!VitaminDWiki comment
Vitamin D deficiency in previous studies has been shown to be strongly associated with [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1064|race], [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=339|diabetes] and [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=710|high BMI].

So, it is no surprise that after __‘’adjusting’’ __for those factors that no other association of PAD to vitamin D remained.

What is surprising was that any association remained – that of nerve conduction velocity, which affects how fast a person can react, say when off-balance. 
If the nerves are either 
*too slow to either announce the act of falling 
*or too slow to pass along the command to the muscles to react to the in-balance.
The person will be more likely to fall.
Many studies have found that [https://www.VitaminDWiki.com/tiki-index.php?page_id=1260|adequate vitamin D reduces falling].
