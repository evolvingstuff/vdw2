* Taking vitamin D supplements can significantly increase weight loss, according to a recent study.

* People who took vitamin D supplements had over four times the weight loss as those that did not, researchers found.

* Vitamin D also doubled the number of inches taken off their waistlines.

* Low levels of vitamin D is repeatedly linked to being overweight and obese.

* Almost 40 percent of obese people are deficient in vitamin D.

* The study included 400 obese and overweight people with vitamin D deficiency.

* They were put on a low-calorie diet and split into three groups.

* One group took 25,000 IU of vitamin D per month,

   * the second took 100,000 IU of vitamin D per month and the 

   * control group took none.

* Six months later the results showed that both vitamin D groups had lost more weight than those who were not taking the vitamin.

* Those taking  **100,000 (per month** , or around 3,000 IU per day, had  **12 pounds**  of weight loss.

* People taking 25,000 IU, or around 800 IU per day, lost 8 pounds.

* In comparison, those only following the calorie restricted diet had just **2.6**  pounds of weight loss over the six months.

* The study’s authors write:

   * “The present data indicate that in obese and overweight people with vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation aids weight loss and enhances the beneficial effects of a reduced-calorie diet.”

* Measurements of dieters’ waistlines also revealed vitamin D had had an effect.

* Those taking 100,000 IU lost an average of two inches from their waistline compared to just over 1 inch in the control group.

* The researchers conclude:

   * “All people affected by obesity should have their levels of vitamin D tested to see if they are deficient, and if so, begin taking supplements.”

#### Meta-analysis found no weight loss benefit (but NONE of the trials used high-dose Vitamin D for a long time)

 **Also, none of the trials analyzed used calorie restriction or exercise**

Background and Objectives: The controversy about the impact of vitamin D supplementation on weight loss treatment was observed in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This meta-analysis investigates the effects of vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) on weight loss through holistic measurements of Body Mass Index (BMI), weight and waist circumference. 

Materials and Methods: Google Scholar, WOS, PubMed and Scopus were explored to collect relevant studies. The selected articles focused on vitamin D supplementation in overweight and obese individuals with different conditions. Eleven RCTs were included into this meta-analysis with a total of 947 subjects, with a mean of the follow-up from 1 to 12 months and different vitamin D interventions (from 25,000 to 600,000 IU/monthly of cholecalciferol). 

Results: The meta-analyzed mean differences for random effects showed that cholecalciferol supplementation deceases the BMI by −0.32 kg/m2 (CI95% −0.52, −0.12 kg/m2, p = 0.002) and the waist circumference by −1.42 cm (CI95% −2.41, −0.42 cm, p = 0.005), but does not statistically affect weight loss −0.43 kg (CI95% −1.05, +0.19 kg, p = 0.17). 

Conclusions: This meta-analysis lays the foundation for defining the potential clinical efficacy of vitamin D supplementation as a potential therapeutic option for weight loss programs, but further studies are needed to confirm the validity of these findings and delineate potential underlying mechanisms.
