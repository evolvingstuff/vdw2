# First ran across lycopene and UV in a [Mercola Article Nov 2010](http://www.naturalnews.com/030500_vitamin_D_absorption.html)

"If you burn easily, consider supplementing your diet with lycopene, a key nutrient that is found in heavy concentration in tomatoes. Studies recently showed that those with high levels of lycopene had a much higher "internal sunscreen," and burned much less easily, than those who did not take in a lot of lycopene. In fact, antioxidants in general may give your skin an edge against UV sensitivity and cut down on burning."

# [Smart Skin Care](http://www.smartskincare.com/treatments/topical/lycopene.html) says

"lycopene has SPF of about 3,"

# [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene_%28data_page%29) entry shows that it does block some UVA (tanning) but not UVB (vitamin D)

# [BBC mentions a test](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/humanbody/truthaboutfood/young/tomatoes.shtml)

Volunteers on the lycopene diet had a 30% increase in skin protection after eating 55 grams of tomatoe paste everyday for 12 weeks.

## It appears that instead of easting tomatoe paste for 12 weeks you could instead just put on a poor (blocks only UVA and not UVB) 3.0 sunscreen
