#### Hypothesis: Spike Protein Causing Problems in Both Long COVID & Vaccine Injury--Proposed Regimen for Research

 **[Trial Site News](https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/hypothesis-spike-protein-causing-problems-in-both-long-covid-vaccine-injury-proposed-regimen-for-research-011bc276)** 

Reporting on  **Clinical Approach to Post-acute Sequelae After COVID-19 Infection and Vaccination – Nov 2023** 

Cureus 15(11): e49204. doi:10.7759/cureus.49204

Nicolas Hulscher • Brian C. Procter • Cade Wynn • Peter A. McCullough

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to exhibit pathogenic characteristics and be a possible cause of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines utilize a modified, stabilized prefusion spike protein that may share similar toxic effects with its viral

counterpart. The aim of this study is to investigate possible mechanisms of harm to biological systems from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and vaccine-encoded spike protein and to propose possible mitigation strategies.

We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ‘grey literature’ to find studies that (1) investigated the effects of the spike protein on biological systems, (2) helped differentiate between viral and vaccine-generated spike proteins, and (3) identified possible spike protein detoxification protocols and compounds that had signals

of benefit and acceptable safety profiles. We found abundant evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may cause damage in the cardiovascular, hematological, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immunological systems. Viral and vaccine-encoded spike proteins have been shown to play a direct role in

cardiovascular and thrombotic injuries from both SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination. Detection of spike protein for at least 6-15 months after vaccination and infection in those with post-acute sequelae indicates spike protein as a possible primary contributing factor to long COVID. We rationalized that these findings give

support to the potential benefit of spike protein detoxification protocols in those with long-term postinfection and/or vaccine-induced complications. 

We propose a **base spike detoxification protocol** , composed of oral 

* nattokinase, 

* bromelain, and 

* curcumin. 

This approach holds immense promise as a base of clinical care, upon which additional therapeutic agents are applied with the goal of aiding in the resolution of postacute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Large-scale, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted in order to determine the relative risks and benefits of the base spike detoxification protocol.

!!!!Hypothesis: Spike Protein Causing Problems in Both Long COVID &amp; Vaccine Injury--Proposed Regimen for Research

Reporting on __Clinical Approach to Post-acute Sequelae After COVID-19 Infection and Vaccination – Nov 2023__
Cureus 15(11): e49204. doi:10.7759/cureus.49204

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to exhibit pathogenic characteristics and be a possible cause of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines utilize a modified, stabilized prefusion spike protein that may share similar toxic effects with its viral
counterpart. The aim of this study is to investigate possible mechanisms of harm to biological systems from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and vaccine-encoded spike protein and to propose possible mitigation strategies.
We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ‘grey literature’ to find studies that (1) investigated the effects of the spike protein on biological systems, (2) helped differentiate between viral and vaccine-generated spike proteins, and (3) identified possible spike protein detoxification protocols and compounds that had signals
of benefit and acceptable safety profiles. We found abundant evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may cause damage in the cardiovascular, hematological, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immunological systems. Viral and vaccine-encoded spike proteins have been shown to play a direct role in
cardiovascular and thrombotic injuries from both SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination. Detection of spike protein for at least 6-15 months after vaccination and infection in those with post-acute sequelae indicates spike protein as a possible primary contributing factor to long COVID. We rationalized that these findings give
support to the potential benefit of spike protein detoxification protocols in those with long-term postinfection and/or vaccine-induced complications. 

We propose a__ base spike detoxification protocol__, composed of oral 
*nattokinase, 
*bromelain, and 
*curcumin. 
This approach holds immense promise as a base of clinical care, upon which additional therapeutic agents are applied with the goal of aiding in the resolution of postacute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Large-scale, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted in order to determine the relative risks and benefits of the base spike detoxification protocol.
