Members of my family noticed this as well.

* My 103 year old father-in-law had lots of constipation after increasing vitamin D to 17,000 IU daily - cured by also increaseing his Magnesium intake

* My 73 year-old wive had constipation when taking [hydrocodone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) untill we increase her Magnesium intake
