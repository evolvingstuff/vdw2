Introduction: SARS-COV-2 is has led to a worldwide pandemic COVID-19 vaccine roll out proceeds worldwide, attention is increasingly being paid to vaccination of older people that can affect vaccine efficacy. Iron deficiency anaemia and Vitamin D deficiency is a leading global cause of years lived with disability.

Aims and Objective: To study the immune response in Vitamin D, Iron deficiency when compared to non deficient covid vaccinated recipients.

Methods: This is a hospital based observational cross-sectional study done between April 2021 to September 2021 in elderly Indian population. Total 360 vaccine recepients attending OPD post vaccination between 15-45 days were measured anti-RBD IgG antibody & anti-spike S1/S2 antibodies, vitamin D, Iron, TIBC, HB, levels in above 60 years.

Results: Out of 360 vaccine recipients, 46 had COVID-19, and we have excluded them from the study. Of the 314,They were grouped as Group I: Vitamin D deficient, Group II; Iron Deficiency, Group III :has both Deficiency of Vitamin D & Iron. GroupIV: has No Deficiency In Study I: We Compared age, sex hematological indices, vitamin D. In 314 Vaccine recipient 57.3%Male, 42.7% were female In Study II: 35% Vitamin D deficient ,30.6% Iron deficiency,23.6% had both deficiency 10.8% have no deficiency. In Study III Responses were evaluated post-vaccine RBD IgG concentration and Spike antibodies were each significantly higher among the No deficiency recipients, when compared to Iron & vitamin D Deficient recipients.

Conclusions: An integrated approach is required to better understand aging & how vaccines work in elderly which will help in improving the immune response after vaccination.
