Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a higher risk of multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential association between predicted levels of serum 25(OH)D and the risk of new-onset hypertension in a large Mediterranean cohort. A validated 136-item food frequency questionnaire was used as the dietary assessment tool. 25(OH)D serum levels were predicted using a previously validated equation. We performed Cox regression models to analyze the association between predicted serum 25(OH)D and the risk of hypertension, according to quartiles of forecasted vitamin D at baseline, after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 2338 new cases of hypertension were identified. 

The analyses revealed a significant inverse association between predicted serum levels of 25(OH)D at baseline and the risk of hypertension. Individuals in the highest quartile showed a 30% relatively lower risk of hypertension compared to the lowest quartile (hazard ratio (HR): 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60â€“0.80, p-trend < 0.001). The outcomes remained significant after performing sensitivity analyses. The findings suggested that higher levels of forecasted vitamin D are inversely and independently associated with the risk of incident hypertension, implying that vitamin D may offer protective benefits against the disease.
