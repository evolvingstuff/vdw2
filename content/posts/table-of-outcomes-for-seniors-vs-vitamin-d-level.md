#### STRATIFYING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK BY VITAMIN D LEVELS: WHAT ARE THE OPTIMAL CUTOFFS?

31,000 Seniors - average age 67

The following is clipped from the attached 3 page poster of March 2010

 **Outcomes for those having blood level of vitamin D< 10ng/ml vs those having > 43 ng/ml** 

If outcome shows HR = 2, then a person having >43 ng/ml is 2X less likely to have the outcome than if he had <10 ng/ml

HR defined below the table

hazard ratio  = A measure of how often a particular event happens in one group compared to how often it happens in another group, over time. In cancer research, hazard ratios are often used in clinical trials to measure survival at any point in time in a group of patients who have been given a specific treatment compared to a control group given another treatment or a placebo. A hazard ratio of one means that there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups.
