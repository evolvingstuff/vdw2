However, because current evidence is weak, we suggest <strong>against</strong> vitamin D administration as a therapy for respiratory infections, beyond the correction of a documented vitamin D deficiency.</p></li><li><p>No definitive evidence exists to recommend vitamin D supplementation for prevention of respiratory infections (non-associated with wheezing) or recurrent respiratory infections. However, some studies suggested that serum 25(OH)D higher than those needed for the prevention of nutritional rickets may be necessary to exert a regulatory effect on the immune system.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine 25(OH)D testing in children with respiratory infections.</p></li><li><p>A single RCT suggested that vitamin D supplementation may help in preventing non complicated acute otitis media. However, considering this limited evidence, evaluation of serum 25(OH)D levels may be reasonable before starting supplementation in these children.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Other infections</strong></p><ul><li><p>Reduced serum 25(OH)D levels are found in children with different types of infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, viral hepatitis, acute diarrhea).</p></li><li><p>However, available evidence does not support a causal relationship between hypovitaminosis D and infections.</p></li><li><p>We suggest the evaluation of vitamin D status only in patients affected by tuberculosis or HIV infection, as they may benefit from vitamin D supplementation, in particular due to concomitant treatments that influence vitamin D metabolism.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> vitamin D supplementation to reduce incidence or severity of non-respiratory infections in children. However, as few studies showed that vitamin D supplementation improves clinical parameters in patients with active tuberculosis or HIV infection, more rigorous and extensive studies are needed to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases, considering also the setting of care, children&rsquo;s age and nutritional status, potential co-infections and compliance with anti-infective therapy.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Asthma</strong></p><ul><li><p>Recent meta-analyses did not find an association between 25(OH)D levels in cord blood or during pregnancy and the development of asthma later in life.</p></li><li><p>Several studies showed a relationship between latitude, prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and increase in allergic asthma prevalence in the pediatric population.</p></li><li><p>Low serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with increased asthma severity and increased risk of asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization or medical treatment. Recent meta-analyses suggest that supplementation with vitamin D (500-2000 IU/day) may reduce the risk of asthma exacerbation.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine 25(OH)D testing in children with asthma.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Atopic dermatitis and allergic diseases</strong></p><ul><li><p>Low serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with increased incidence and/or severity of AD in children in most but not all studies. Indeed, a pathogenetic role of vitamin D in AD has yet to be demonstrated.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine 25(OH)D testing in children with AD. Serum 25(OH)D evaluation may be considered in children with severe AD unresponsive to common therapy and multiple risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.</p></li><li><p>In pediatric population there is limited evidence regarding a possible favourable effect of vitamin D supplementation on several aspects of AD.</p></li><li><p>A short trial of vitamin D supplementation can be considered in patients with severe AD unresponsive to common therapy, especially in the late winter-early spring period. In presence of documented vitamin D deficiency, we recommended adequate treatment to restore vitamin D status, followed by supplementation at doses recommended for age.</p></li><li><p>Vitamin D supplementation for primary prevention of allergic diseases, including food allergies, remains an attractive area of study, but actual evidence does not allow to make any recommendation.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Type 1 diabetes mellitus</strong></p><ul><li><p>Children and adolescents with T1DM are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.</p></li><li><p>Recommended vitamin D intakes in patients with T1DM are the same as those for the healthy pediatric population.</p></li><li><p>Recommendations for vitamin D treatment in subjects with T1DM and vitamin D deficiency are the same as those for the healthy pediatric population.</p></li><li><p>At present, there is no evidence that vitamin D supplementation may delay the development of T1DM or may ameliorate its clinical features. However, we recommend to maintain vitamin D intake for age and to treat vitamin D deficiency if found.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine 25(OH)D testing in children with T1DM.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Inflammatory bowel diseases</strong></p><ul><li><p>In patients with IBDs (Crohn&rsquo;s disease or ulcerative colitis) we suggest to evaluate serum 25(OH)D levels at diagnosis and at least yearly, preferably in the late winter-early spring period.</p></li><li><p>We recommend continuous vitamin D supplementation at higher doses than those recommended for age (at least 1000-1500 IU/day).</p></li><li><p>We recommend to treat vitamin D deficiency with daily vitamin D at higher doses than those recommended for otherwise healthy pediatric population (at least 2000-4000 IU/day), for a minimum of 6-8 weeks.</p></li><li><p>Intermittent bolus doses of vitamin D for a cumulative dose of at least 400000 IU should be reserved for IBDs patients with vitamin D deficiency and poor compliance with daily treatment.</p></li><li><p>After achieving vitamin D sufficiency, we recommend to continue with vitamin D supplementation at higher doses than those recommended for age (at least 1000-1500 IU/day).</p></li></ul><p><strong>Celiac disease</strong></p><ul><li><p>We recommend to evaluate serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CD at diagnosis and 6-12 months after the beginning of gluten-free diet if deficiency</p></li><li><p>has been found.

Obese subjects with reduced sun exposure during summer should receive vitamin D supplementation throughout the year. Finally, sensible sunlight exposure and outdoor physical exercise should be encouraged in obese children and adolescents.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine evaluation of 25(OH)D levels in obese subjects. If an obese individual does not receive vitamin D supplementation and has a sedentary indoor lifestyle with consequent reduced sun exposure, serum 25(OH)D evaluation may be considered to confirm vitamin D deficiency and start adequate treatment.</p></li><li><p>In obese subjects with vitamin D deficiency we recommend vitamin D treatment at higher doses than those recommended for otherwise healthy pediatric population (at least 2000-4000 IU/day), for a minimum of 6-8 weeks.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Autism</strong></p><ul><li><p>Autistic individuals frequently develop nutritional deficiencies, especially in presence of food selectivity;</p></li><li><p>causal relationship with vitamin D deficiency is uncertain.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine evaluation of 25(OH)D levels in children with autism.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> vitamin D treatment to improve patient&rsquo;s performance considering the limited and conflicting available evidence.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Depression</strong></p><ul><li><p>Epidemiological studies that evaluated an association between vitamin D deficiency and depression are lacking at present.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> routine evaluation of 25(OH)D levels in children with depression.</p></li><li><p>We recommend <strong>against</strong> vitamin D administration to improve mood.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Pregnancy and breastfeeding</strong></p><ul><li><p>We suggest <strong>against</strong> routine screening of serum 25(OH)D levels in all pregnant and breastfeeding women.
