<p>Purpose: Magnesium is vital to maintain normal physiological functions. We aimed to identify the association between serum magnesium and different measures of body adiposity among Qatari adults. We hypothesized that the association was mediated by depression and sleep duration.</p>
<p>Patients and Methods: The study included 1000 adults aged 20 years and above who attended the Qatar Biobank Study (QBB) between 2012 and 2019. Body adiposity was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum magnesium concentration was measured. Sub-optimal magnesium was defined as magnesium concentration less than 0.85 mmol/L. The association was examined using linear regression.</p>
<p>Results: The mean age of the participants (n=1000) was 35.8 (SD 10.3) years. More than half of the participants had sub-optimal magnesium concentrations (60.2% in men and 52.3% in women). Serum magnesium was inversely associated with different types of fat mass. In the fully adjusted model, per 1 SD increment of serum magnesium had standardized regression coefficients of − 0.09 (p 0.005) for total fat mass, − 0.08 (p 0.008) for trunk fat, − 0.09 (p 0.003) for gynoid fat and − 0.08 (p 0.008) for android fat.</p>
<p>There was no gender difference in the association.</p>
<p>The inverse association between serum magnesium and fat mass was significant in those with sleep duration ≥ 7 hours but not in those &lt; 7 hours. Depressive symptom and sleep did not mediate the association between serum magnesium and fat mass. Serum magnesium was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome (per 1 SD increment had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.57– 0.85)).</p>
<p>Conclusion: There was an inverse association between serum magnesium and fat mass, especially among those with an adequate sleep duration and without chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension and depression.</p>

<p>The aims were to optimize a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based assay for quantifying ionized or free magnesium and investigate its association with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A high-throughput, ionized magnesium assay was optimized and evaluated. Plasma magnesium was quantified, and associations with T2D were ascertained in Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) participants. Coefficients of variation for the ionized magnesium assay ranged from 0.7–1.5% for intra-assay and 4.2–4.7% for inter-assay precision. In IRAS (n = 1342), ionized magnesium was significantly lower in subjects with prediabetes and T2D than in normoglycemic subjects, and lower in participants with T2D than those with prediabetes (p &lt; 0.0001). Cross-sectional regression analyses revealed that magnesium was associated with T2D at baseline in models adjusted for multiple clinical risk factors (p = 0.032). This association appeared to be modified by sex, in such a way that the associations were present in women (OR = 0.54 (95% CI 0.37–0.79), p = 0.0015) and not in men (OR = 0.98 (95% CI 0.71–1.35), p = 0.90). Longitudinal regression analyses revealed an inverse association between magnesium and future T2D in the total population (p = 0.035) that was attenuated by LP-IR (p = 0.22). No interactions were detected between magnesium and age, race, BMI, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, or LPIR for the prospective association with future T2D. However, a significant interaction between magnesium and sex was present, now with a trend for an association in men (OR = 0.75 (95% CI 0.55–1.02), p = 0.065 and absence of an association in women (OR = 1.01 (0.76–1.33), p = 0.97). Conclusions: lower ionized magnesium, as measured by an NMR-based assay optimized for accuracy and precision, was associated cross-sectionally with T2D at baseline and longitudinally with incident T2D in IRAS.</p>

 **Ionized vs total Magnesium**

 **Comment on chart by visitor Patrick  Jan 2023** 

A healthy population should have a slope of .7 not .96

I’m quite sure they never normalized for serum Ca. 

Mean US Ca:Mg is over 3.0 and should be 2.0. 

That means the graph represents a total Mg 50% too low =&gt; .96 goes to about .7

&lt;img src=&quot;/attachments/d3.mock.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; width=&quot;680&quot;&gt;

We aimed to identify the association between serum magnesium and different measures of body adiposity among Qatari adults. We hypothesized that the association was mediated by depression and sleep duration.\n\nPatients and Methods: The study included 1000 adults aged 20 years and above who attended the Qatar Biobank Study (QBB) between 2012 and 2019. Body adiposity was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum magnesium concentration was measured. Sub-optimal magnesium was defined as magnesium concentration less than 0.85 mmol/L. The association was examined using linear regression.\n\nResults: The mean age of the participants (n=1000) was 35.8 (SD 10.3) years. More than half of the participants had sub-optimal magnesium concentrations (60.2% in men and 52.3% in women). Serum magnesium was inversely associated with different types of fat mass. In the fully adjusted model, per 1 SD increment of serum magnesium had standardized regression coefficients of − 0.09 (p 0.005) for total fat mass, − 0.08 (p 0.008) for trunk fat, − 0.09 (p 0.003) for gynoid fat and − 0.08 (p 0.008) for android fat. \n\nThere was no gender difference in the association. \n\nThe inverse association between serum magnesium and fat mass was significant in those with sleep duration ≥ 7 hours but not in those &lt; 7 hours. Depressive symptom and sleep did not mediate the association between serum magnesium and fat mass. Serum magnesium was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome (per 1 SD increment had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.57– 0.85)).\n\nConclusion: There was an inverse association between serum magnesium and fat mass, especially among those with an adequate sleep duration and without chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension and depression.\n`

A high-throughput, ionized magnesium assay was optimized and evaluated. Plasma magnesium was quantified, and associations with T2D were ascertained in Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) participants. Coefficients of variation for the ionized magnesium assay ranged from 0.7–1.5% for intra-assay and 4.2–4.7% for inter-assay precision. In IRAS (n = 1342), ionized magnesium was significantly lower in subjects with prediabetes and T2D than in normoglycemic subjects, and lower in participants with T2D than those with prediabetes (p &lt; 0.0001). Cross-sectional regression analyses revealed that magnesium was associated with T2D at baseline in models adjusted for multiple clinical risk factors (p = 0.032). This association appeared to be modified by sex, in such a way that the associations were present in women (OR = 0.54 (95% CI 0.37–0.79), p = 0.0015) and not in men (OR = 0.98 (95% CI 0.71–1.35), p = 0.90). Longitudinal regression analyses revealed an inverse association between magnesium and future T2D in the total population (p = 0.035) that was attenuated by LP-IR (p = 0.22). No interactions were detected between magnesium and age, race, BMI, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, or LPIR for the prospective association with future T2D. However, a significant interaction between magnesium and sex was present, now with a trend for an association in men (OR = 0.75 (95% CI 0.55–1.02), p = 0.065 and absence of an association in women (OR = 1.01 (0.76–1.33), p = 0.97). Conclusions: lower ionized magnesium, as measured by an NMR-based assay optimized for accuracy and precision, was associated cross-sectionally with T2D at baseline and longitudinally with incident T2D in IRAS.\n`

Purpose: Magnesium is vital to maintain normal physiological functions. We aimed to identify the association between serum magnesium and different measures of body adiposity among Qatari adults. We hypothesized that the association was mediated by depression and sleep duration.

Patients and Methods: The study included 1000 adults aged 20 years and above who attended the Qatar Biobank Study (QBB) between 2012 and 2019. Body adiposity was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Serum magnesium concentration was measured. Sub-optimal magnesium was defined as magnesium concentration less than 0.85 mmol/L. The association was examined using linear regression.

Results: The mean age of the participants (n=1000) was 35.8 (SD 10.3) years. More than half of the participants had sub-optimal magnesium concentrations (60.2% in men and 52.3% in women). Serum magnesium was inversely associated with different types of fat mass. In the fully adjusted model, per 1 SD increment of serum magnesium had standardized regression coefficients of − 0.09 (p 0.005) for total fat mass, − 0.08 (p 0.008) for trunk fat, − 0.09 (p 0.003) for gynoid fat and − 0.08 (p 0.008) for android fat. 

There was no gender difference in the association. 

The inverse association between serum magnesium and fat mass was significant in those with sleep duration ≥ 7 hours but not in those &lt; 7 hours. Depressive symptom and sleep did not mediate the association between serum magnesium and fat mass. Serum magnesium was inversely associated with metabolic syndrome (per 1 SD increment had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.57– 0.85)).

Conclusion: There was an inverse association between serum magnesium and fat mass, especially among those with an adequate sleep duration and without chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension and depression.

__Comment on chart by visitor Patrick  Jan 2023__
A healthy population should have a slope of .7 not .96
I’m quite sure they never normalized for serum Ca. 
Mean US Ca:Mg is over 3.0 and should be 2.0. 
That means the graph represents a total Mg 50% too low =&gt; .96 goes to about .7

The aims were to optimize a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based assay for quantifying ionized or free magnesium and investigate its association with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A high-throughput, ionized magnesium assay was optimized and evaluated. Plasma magnesium was quantified, and associations with T2D were ascertained in Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) participants. Coefficients of variation for the ionized magnesium assay ranged from 0.7–1.5% for intra-assay and 4.2–4.7% for inter-assay precision. In IRAS (n = 1342), ionized magnesium was significantly lower in subjects with prediabetes and T2D than in normoglycemic subjects, and lower in participants with T2D than those with prediabetes (p &lt; 0.0001). Cross-sectional regression analyses revealed that magnesium was associated with T2D at baseline in models adjusted for multiple clinical risk factors (p = 0.032). This association appeared to be modified by sex, in such a way that the associations were present in women (OR = 0.54 (95% CI 0.37–0.79), p = 0.0015) and not in men (OR = 0.98 (95% CI 0.71–1.35), p = 0.90). Longitudinal regression analyses revealed an inverse association between magnesium and future T2D in the total population (p = 0.035) that was attenuated by LP-IR (p = 0.22). No interactions were detected between magnesium and age, race, BMI, glucose, insulin, triglycerides, or LPIR for the prospective association with future T2D. However, a significant interaction between magnesium and sex was present, now with a trend for an association in men (OR = 0.75 (95% CI 0.55–1.02), p = 0.065 and absence of an association in women (OR = 1.01 (0.76–1.33), p = 0.97). Conclusions: lower ionized magnesium, as measured by an NMR-based assay optimized for accuracy and precision, was associated cross-sectionally with T2D at baseline and longitudinally with incident T2D in IRAS.
