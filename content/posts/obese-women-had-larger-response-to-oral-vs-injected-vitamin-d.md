#### Oral Vitamin D versus Injectable Vitamin D in Treating Obese Women with Vitamin D Deficiency

Egyptian Journal of Hospital Medicine, Volume 94, Issue 1, January 2024, Page 311-314  DOI: 10.21608/ejhm.2024.337170

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread problem especially in females. The presence of different vitamin D preparations (oral, parenteral) with no definite evidence about the most appropriate method for vitamin D deficiency treatment aroused the need for more studies about the most effective route.

Aim: To evaluate the oral vitamin D preparation compared to intramuscular (IM) vitamin D preparation in correcting vitamin D deficiency in affected women. Subjects and methods: This is an interventional research performed on obese female patients diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency in the 2019â€“2022 timeframe for outpatient clinics at Zagazig University Hospitals. Eighty females were included in the study. They were allocated randomly into 2 equal groups (40 females per group); oral group and injection groups, based on their preference. Pre and post intervention assessment was done by assessing the level of serum vitamin D.

Results: There was statistically insignificant difference among studied groups concerning vitamin D level before therapy, while there was significant difference between them after therapy, where oral group had significantly higher level. Within each group, there was significant increase in vitamin D level after therapy. There was statistically significant positive correlation between percent of increase in vitamin D and both age and body mass index (BMI) of patients in the oral group, but no significant correlation was detected in injectable group between age and percent of change.

Conclusion: Treatment for vitamin D insufficiency works well when administered intramuscularly and orally but oral group showed more improvement.

##### Summary: Oral has bigger response to smaller dose (by VitaminDWiki)

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Oral  | Injection |
| 1st month | 50K weekly for 4 weeks | 200K |
| 2nd month | 50K  once a month | 200K |
| 3rd month | 50K once a month | 200K |
| Total IU | 300K | 600K |
| Initial Level | 8.4 ng | 8.4 ng |
| Final level | 26 ng | 21 ng |
| % >20 ng | 100% | 75% |

 **Doubt that they waited the extra 6+ weeks that injection takes for a peak response** 

 **A better experiment would have just given 300K injection once.   
Then both groups would get the same dose   
 &nbsp; and the injection grojup would have 3 months to respond**
