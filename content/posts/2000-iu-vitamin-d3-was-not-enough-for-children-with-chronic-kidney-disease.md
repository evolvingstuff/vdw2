OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of oral cholecalciferol on the levels of vitamin D3 and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

METHODS: We conducted a prospective uncontrolled observational study at the Pediatric Nephrology Clinic of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between January and October 2011 to assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25<span>[OH]</span>D) and iPTH in children with CKD stages 2-5. Children with low vitamin D3 levels were commenced on cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/day. Their 25(OH)D3 and iPTH levels were reassessed, first after 3 months, and then after 6 months. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Paired t-test was used to compare results before and after treatment.

RESULTS: Forty-five children (31 boys and 14 girls) were included in the study. Their mean+/-SD age was 9.6 +/- 4.6 years. There was significant improvement in 25(OH)D3 after 3 months (14.2 +/- 8.2 - 20 +/- 11.1 ng/mL) (p<0.001). However, only 5 children reached levels >/=30 ng/mL. There was no further improvement after 6 months of treatment (20.17 +/- 13.4 ng/mL) (p=0.65). There was no improvement in iPTH levels after 3 and 6 months. No changes were also observed in the levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, or creatinine.

CONCLUSION: The administration of oral vitamin D3 at 2000 IU/day resulted in significant improvement of vitamin D levels in children with CKD, but normalized only in 11% of the patients. The treatment had no effect on iPTH levels.
