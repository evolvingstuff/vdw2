Background: Previously undetected contributors to  **secondary osteoporosis and metabolic bone diseases (SECOB)** are frequently found in patients with osteoporosis, but the prevalence in patients at the time they present with a clinical fracture is unknown. 

Methods: All consecutive patients with a recent clinical vertebral or nonvertebral fracture, who were able and willing to be investigated (n = 626: 482 women, 144 men, age range 50-97 yr) had bone mineral density and laboratory investigations (serum calcium, inorganic phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine, intact PTH, TSH, free T(4), serum and urine protein electrophoresis, and in men also serum testosterone). 

Results: Known SECOB contributors were present in 23.0% of patients and newly diagnosed SECOB contributors in 26.5%: monoclonal proteinemia (14 of 626), renal insufficiency grade III or greater (54 of 626), primary (17 of 626) and secondary (64 of 626) hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism (39 of 626), and hypogonadism in men (12 of 144).  **Newly diagnosed SECOBs, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D less than 50 nmol/liter (in 63.9%)** , and  **dietary calcium intake less than 1200 mg/d (in 90.6%)**  were found at any age, in both sexes, after any fracture (except SECOB in men with finger and toe fractures) and at any level of bone mineral density. 

Conclusion: At presentation with a fracture, 26.5% of patients have previously unknown contributors to SECOB, which are treatable or need follow-up, and  **more than 90% of patients have an inadequate vitamin D status and/or calcium intake.**  Systematic screening of patients with a recent fracture identifies those in whom potentially reversible contributors to SECOB and calcium and vitamin D deficiency are present.
