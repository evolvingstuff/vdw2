#### Everything in excess is opposed to nature, even vitamin D: a case report

Endocrinol Diabetes Metab Case Rep . 2022 Feb 1;2022:21-0181. [doi: 10.1530/EDM-21-0181](https://doi.org/10.1530/EDM-21-0181)

Summary: Vitamin D intoxication in children is rare but its incidence is increasing as vitamin D is supplemented more often and in higher doses. 

Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk for vitamin D intoxication due to incorrect compounded preparations of liposoluble vitamins. Here, we report a severe vitamin D intoxication in a 4-year-old girl with CF, due to an error in the compounded vitamin A, D, E, and K preparation, presenting clinically with weight loss, constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, and nycturia. The administered compounded preparation contained  **10 000-fold the prescribed vitamin D dose** . The patient was treated with hyperhydration, loop diuretics, and bisphosphonates. Serum calcium levels normalized after 4 days but serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels remained elevated even up to 2 months after treatment.

Learning points: Vitamin D intoxication should be ruled out when patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) present with acute polyuria, constipation, and weight loss. Prompt treatment is necessary to avert life-threatening complications. Regularly measuring serum calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in children with CF receiving vitamin A, D, E, and K supplements is important during their follow-up. vitamin D dose.

#### Note: Got 10,000 X too much vitamin D for an unstated number of months ==> in hospital for 4 days

 **Getting 10,000 X of most other things would probably result in death (water, Salt, protein, Magesium, ...)** 

 **Compare this excess Vitamin D to 500 annual DEATHS in the US just due to taking too much aspirin**
