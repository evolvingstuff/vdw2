#### Low 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations May Explain Atherosclerosis in Ancient and Modern Humans.

Glob Heart. 2015 Mar 26. pii: S2211-8160(14)02709-4. [doi: 10.1016/j.gheart.2014.12.001.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gheart.2014.12.001.) <span>[Epub ahead of print]</span>

A recent issue of Global Heart contained a set of articles on the prevalence of atherosclerosis in ancient and modern people. 

An article by Thomas et al. <sup>[1]</sup> suggested that chronic inflammation might be an important contributing factor. 

It noted that in ancient times, inflammation could be due to microbes and parasites, whereas in modern times, it could be due to chronic systemic inflammatory diseases.
