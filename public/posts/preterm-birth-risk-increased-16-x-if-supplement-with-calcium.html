Preterm birth and monthly VD and calcium supplementation during pregnancy were obtained by the questionnaire. The logistic model was conducted to exam the association. The distributed lag nonlinear model was applied to explore the critical window for the supplements.</p><p>Results</p><p>Preterm birth occurred in 4.4 % (285/6501) of the study subjects with single live births and the rates were 39.7% and 82.6% for single VD supplementation or calcium supplementation in pregnancy. The adjusted OR (95% CI) for preterm birth was 1.428 (1.115–1.829) related to VD and 0.883 (0.652–1.216) related to calcium. It is interesting to note that the increased risk of preterm birth with VD supplementation during pregnancy was only seen in pregnant women who supplemented with calcium ( <strong>OR was 1.600</strong> ) and had a significant increase in preterm birth weight (P = 0.040). Besides, supplementation VD with calcium during pregnancy from the 3rd to 6th month during pregnancy was associated with preterm birth (OR3rd = 1.216, 95% CI: 1.119–1.320; OR 4th = 1.275, 95% CI: 1.152–1.411; OR 5th = 1.279, 95% CI: 1.130–1.446; OR6th = 1.208, 95% CI: 1.076–1.356). Moreover, birth weight mediated 10.8% of the total effect of supplementation on preterm birth.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Women who supplemented with VD among taking calcium during pregnancy were more likely to experience preterm birth, and birth weight partly mediates the effect. The critical window for association between supplements and preterm birth may be from the <strong>3rd to 6th weeks of pregnancy</strong> .</p><hr><h4 id=serum-calcium-level-at-32-weeks-of-gestation-could-be-applied-as-a-predictor-of-preterm-delivery-a-retrospective-study---aug-2024>Serum calcium level at 32 weeks of gestation could be applied as a predictor of preterm delivery: a retrospective study - Aug 2024</h4><p>European Journal of Medical Research August 2024</p><p>Jingjing Zhang, Chong Fan, Chenyang Xu, Yuhan Zhang, Jingyan Liu, Chunxiu Zhou, Shanwu Feng & Yuru Fan</p><p>Preterm delivery (PTD) is associated with severe adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and higher medical costs. Therefore, PTD warrants more attention. However, predicting PTD remains a challenge for researchers. This study aimed to investigate potential prenatal predictors of PTD. We retrospectively recruited pregnant women who experienced either PTD or term delivery (TD) and underwent laboratory examinations at 32 weeks of gestation. We compared the test results between the two groups and performed logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to identify risk factors and predictive factors for PTD. Our investigation revealed that the PTD cohort exhibited statistically significant elevations in lymphocyte count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, calcium, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides, and total bile acids. Conversely, the PTD group demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean corpuscular volume, homocysteine, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), neutrophils to (white blood cells–neutrophils) ratio (dNLR), and (neutrophils × monocytes) to lymphocyte ratio (SIRI). The ROC curve analysis revealed that calcium had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.705, with a cut-off value of 2.215. Logistic regression analysis showed that premature rupture of membranes was an independent risk factor for PTD. Our study demonstrated that serum calcium levels, NLR, dNLR, and other laboratory tests conducted at 32 weeks of gestation can serve as predictors for PTD. Furthermore, we identified premature rupture of membranes as a risk factor for PTD.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/preterm-32-weeks-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384353"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384353",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384353"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384353"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384353"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384353"></script></body></html>
