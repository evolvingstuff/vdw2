 **Vitamin D helped those who had very low levels (< 12ng) when entering the ICU** 

 **(Note: = 42% of patients)**

 **Vitamin D would have helped even more patients if** 

Had limited the amount of Calcium taken (But this is extremely hard to do in a RCT)

Had provided Omega-3 to increase the benefit of vitamin D to the cells 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(The results of Omega-3 are not measures by a blood test, but Omega-3 increases Vit D to the cellsl)

“However, only half of patients treated with vitamin D3 achieved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels higher than 30ng/mL.”

 **Would have had significantly more responses > 30ng if they had** 

Provided other forms of vitamin D - there are about 20 - such as injection

Provided co-factors to increase the response – such as Magnesium ~30% increased response

Had spread the loading dose over a week or so ~20% increased response

Had given the vitamin D after the largest meal of the day ~30% increased response
