#### Correcting Anemia and Native Vitamin D Supplementation in Kidney Transplant Recipients (CANDLE-KIT): a Multicenter, 2×2 Factorial, Open-label, Randomized Clinical Trial

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Increased chance of benefit if they had done one or more of the following:</span>  
Used more vitamin D(say 4,000 IU)  
Started dosing weeks before transplant (dialysis often filters out the vitamin D)   
Started with a loading dose  
Used a different form of Vitamin D (such as Calcitriol)  
Used a source of vitamin D that does not require a healthy gut (topical, UVB, injection)  
Also added supplements which reduce inflammation (such as Omega-3)**
