OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and a wide range of health conditions, physical performance measures, disability, and mortality in a large epidemiological study to identify an optimum range for 25(OH)D concentrations.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, with additional prospective data on falls and mortality.

SETTING: Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project, Sydney, Australia.

PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling men aged 70 and older (N = 1,659).

MEASUREMENTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels, general health status, self-reported diseases, physical performance measures, disability (activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living) and falls.

RESULTS:  **Fair, poor, and very poor health; self-reported diabetes mellitus; hyperglycemia; depression; muscle weakness; poor balance; and all-cause mortality were all associated with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 50 nmol/L, even after adjustment for confounding** . 

The findings also suggest that, in older men, for a wide range of health conditions, physical performance measures, disability, falls, and mortality, the  **optimum range**  of 25(OH)D is between 50.0 and 74.9 nmol/L, with no additional benefit for 25(OH)D levels of 75.0 nmol/L or greater.

CONCLUSION: Programs aimed at achieving an optimum range of serum 25(OH)D at levels between 50.0 and 74.9 nmol/L may have overall health benefits and such levels are adequate for older men.
