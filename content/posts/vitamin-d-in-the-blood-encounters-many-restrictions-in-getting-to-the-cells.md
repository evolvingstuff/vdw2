Vitamin D plays a role not only in the proper functioning of the skeletal system and the calcium-phosphate equilibrium, but also in the immune system, the cardiovascular system and the growth and division of cells. Although numerous studies have reported on the analysis of vitamin D status in various groups of patients, the clinical significance of measurements of vitamin D forms and metabolites remains ambiguous. This article reviews the reports analyzing the status of vitamin D in various chronic states. Particular attention is given to factors affecting measurement of vitamin D forms and metabolites. Relevant papers published during recent years were identified by an extensive PubMed search using appropriate keywords. Measurement of vitamin D status proved to be a useful tool in diagnosis and progression of metabolic syndrome, neurological disorders and cancer. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry has become the preferred method for analyzing the various forms and metabolites of vitamin D in biological fluids. Factors influencing vitamin D concentration, including socio-demographic and biochemical factors as well as the genetic polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor, along with vitamin D transporters and enzymes participating in vitamin D metabolism should be considered as potential confounders of the interpretation of plasma total 25(OH)D concentrations.
