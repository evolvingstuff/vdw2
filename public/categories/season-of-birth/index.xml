&lt;p>The incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) varies with latitude. Ebers has co-ordinated a study &lt;sup>[46]&lt;/sup> that examined more than 40,000 Canadian, British, Danish and Swedish patients with multiple sclerosis. The results show that in the Northern hemisphere, significantly fewer (8.5%) people with MS were born in November and significantly more (9.1%) were born in May. In the Southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed and November is the peak month and May the lowest. There are several clues as to the cause. An important study &lt;sup>[47]&lt;/sup> compared the risk of two or more siblings having multiple sclerosis to the risk of its occurrence in both twins in a non-identical pair. There should be no difference, but non-identical twins do have a significantly higher risk of both having MS than non-twin siblings. This suggests that the pre-natal and post-natal environment affects the overall risk. Pinpointing the actual environmental factor has been problematic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
