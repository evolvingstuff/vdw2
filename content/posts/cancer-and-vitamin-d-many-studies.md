Intensive epigenome and transcriptome analyses have unveiled numerous biological mechanisms, including the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, and induced apoptosis in neoplastic cells, as well as the modulation of the antineoplastic action of the immune system, which plausibly explains the observed population-based relationship between low vitamin D status and increased cancer risk. However, large randomized clinical trials involving cholecalciferol supplementation have so far failed to show the potential of such interventions in cancer prevention. In this article, we attempt to reconcile the supposed contradiction of these findings by undertaking a thorough review of the literature, including an assessment of the limitations in the design, conduct, and analysis of the studies conducted thus far. We examine the long-standing dilemma of whether the beneficial effects of vitamin D levels increase significantly above a critical threshold or if the conjecture is valid that an increase in available cholecalciferol translates directly into an increase in calcitriol activity. In addition, we try to shed light on the high interindividual epigenetic and transcriptomic variability in response to cholecalciferol supplementation. Moreover, we critically review the standards of interpretation of the available study results and propose criteria that could allow us to reach sound conclusions in this field. Finally, we advocate for options tailored to individual vitamin D needs, combined with a comprehensive intervention that favors prevention through a healthy environment and responsible health behaviors.
