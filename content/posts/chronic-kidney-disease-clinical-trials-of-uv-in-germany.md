## Vitamin D and UV exposure in chronic kidney disease

Rolfdieter Krause

Dermato-Endocrinology Vol 5 #1

With loss of renal function and decreasing glomerula filtration rate the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> as well as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <span>[1,25 (OH)2 D]</span> often decrease simultaneously. In representative groups of German patients on renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation) our group retrospectively analyzed the vitamin D status over a period of 12 y (1995‒2006).

Only 11% of patients had a serum level of 25(OH)D that was > 30 ng/ml, more than 70% had a level of 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml. 

In clinical trials we used sun-simulating artificial lamps to produce vitamin D3 in the skin. 

Partial-body irradiation (15% of body surface) was used during the routine hemodialysis treatment. 

Whole-body UV exposure was done in a standing position three times a week before the hemodialysis treatment. With both procedures we observed an increase of the serum level of 25(OH)2D3 by approx. 35–50% over a period of 2‒3 mo, maintenance of trabecular bone mineral density and a normalization of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 

Heart rate variability improved during the whole-body radiation intervention period by 20‒25%. Patients who continued the whole-body irradiation regularly two or three times before starting the routine hemodialysis session had maintained normal levels of circulating 25(OH)D3 and of 1,25(OH)2D3. Therefore, from our data it can be recommended that intermittent suberythemal UVB exposure with a sun-simulation spectrum is effective to treat and/or protect against vitamin D deficiency in chronic and end-stage kidney disease patients.
