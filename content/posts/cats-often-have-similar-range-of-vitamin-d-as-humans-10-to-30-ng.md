##### <span style="color:#00F;">Commercial cat food has a lot of Vitamin D</span>

Background: Optimal vitamin D levels for an effective role in immune function and rickets prevention are thought to vary, but have not yet been definitively determined. Reports on reference values of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in cats are limited.

Aims: The study provides information about serum 25(OH)D values in cats with different age, gender, breed, diet type, reproductive status, housing condition, and also the relationship between these levels and various hematological and biochemical parameters.

Methods: Clinically healthy cats (88) were included in the study. Physical examination and assessment of hematological and biochemical parameters were performed on cats in order to confirm their health status. Reference value of serum 25(OH)D was assayed by ELISA method and the effects of age (under six months and above six months), gender, breed, diet (only commercial diet, only homemade food, mixture of commercial and homemade food), reproduction status, and housing conditions on serum 25(OH)D was determined.

Results: The median, 2.5% and 97.5% of 25(OH)D in sampled cats were 19.74 ng/ml, 3.12 ng/ml, and 92.1 ng/ml, respectively. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was lower when homemade diet was used compared to commercial and mixed diets as well as in cats under six months of age compared to older cats.

Conclusion: Diet type and age can affect serum 25(OH)D levels in healthy cats while other parameters had no significant effects.
