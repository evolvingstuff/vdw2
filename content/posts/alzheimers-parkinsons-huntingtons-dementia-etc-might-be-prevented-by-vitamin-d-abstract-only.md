#### Tremendous Fidelity of Vitamin D3 in Age-related Neurological Disorders

Mol Neurobiol. 2024 Sep;61(9):7211-7238. [doi: 10.1007/s12035-024-03989-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-024-03989-w)

Vitamin D3 (VD) is a secosteroid hormone and shows a pleiotropic effect in brain-related disorders where it regulates redox imbalance, inflammation, apoptosis, energy production, and growth factor synthesis. Vitamin D3's active metabolic form, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol), is a known regulator of several genes involved in neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, neurotropism, and neuroinflammation. Multiple studies suggest that VD deficiency can be proposed as a risk factor for the development of several age-related neurological disorders. 

The evidence for low serum levels of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3 or calcidiol), the major circulating form of VD, is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), dementia, and cognitive impairment. Despite decades of evidence on low VD association with neurological disorders, the precise molecular mechanism behind its beneficial effect remains controversial. Here, we will be delving into the neurobiological importance of VD and discuss its benefits in different neuropsychiatric disorders. The focus will be on AD, PD, and HD as they share some common clinical, pathological, and epidemiological features. 

The central focus will be on the different attributes of VD in the aspect of its 

* anti-oxidative, 

* anti-inflammatory, 

* anti-apoptotic, 

* anti-cholinesterase activity, and 

* psychotropic effect 

in different neurodegenerative diseases.

#### Might Vitamin D prevent any of the following diseases: Alzheimer's, Parkenson's, and Huntington?  asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024

Based on the provided search results, there is evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, the exact role of vitamin D in preventing these diseases is not fully understood and requires further research.

 **Alzheimer's Disease** 

* Epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD have been found to have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D3 compared to healthy controls.

* Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a 21% increased risk of AD.

* Low serum vitamin D levels (<30 ng/ml) and polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor have been associated with AD.

 **Parkinson's Disease** 

* Vitamin D deficiency appears to be common in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.

* Vitamin D has been shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, which may provide neuroprotection in PD.

 **Huntington's Disease** 

* Vitamin D deficiency is common among Huntington's disease patients, with up to 89% having insufficient levels (<50 nmol/L).

* There is evidence of disease-specific alterations in bone metabolism and increased fracture risk in Huntington's disease patients, which may be related to vitamin D deficiency.

While these findings suggest a potential role for vitamin D in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, the causal link is still a matter of debate. Randomized clinical trials examining vitamin D supplementation in patients with these disorders are needed to determine the optimal timing, efficacy, and appropriate dosing.It is important to note that vitamin D interacts with various mechanisms and may be a potential multitargeted therapeutic option for prevention and protection from cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.

!!!!Tremendous Fidelity of Vitamin D3 in Age-related Neurological Disorders
Mol Neurobiol. 2024 Sep;61(9):7211-7238. doi: 10.1007/s12035-024-03989-w

Vitamin D3 (VD) is a secosteroid hormone and shows a pleiotropic effect in brain-related disorders where it regulates redox imbalance, inflammation, apoptosis, energy production, and growth factor synthesis. Vitamin D3&#39;s active metabolic form, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol), is a known regulator of several genes involved in neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, neurotropism, and neuroinflammation. Multiple studies suggest that VD deficiency can be proposed as a risk factor for the development of several age-related neurological disorders. 
The evidence for low serum levels of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3 or calcidiol), the major circulating form of VD, is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD), Huntington&#39;s disease (HD), dementia, and cognitive impairment. Despite decades of evidence on low VD association with neurological disorders, the precise molecular mechanism behind its beneficial effect remains controversial. Here, we will be delving into the neurobiological importance of VD and discuss its benefits in different neuropsychiatric disorders. The focus will be on AD, PD, and HD as they share some common clinical, pathological, and epidemiological features. 
The central focus will be on the different attributes of VD in the aspect of its 
*anti-oxidative, 
*anti-inflammatory, 
*anti-apoptotic, 
*anti-cholinesterase activity, and 
*psychotropic effect 
in different neurodegenerative diseases.

!!!!Might Vitamin D prevent any of the following diseases: Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkenson&#39;s, and Huntington?  asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024
Based on the provided search results, there is evidence suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease, and Huntington&#39;s disease. However, the exact role of vitamin D in preventing these diseases is not fully understood and requires further research.

__Alzheimer&#39;s Disease__
*Epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). Patients with AD have been found to have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D3 compared to healthy controls.
*Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a 21% increased risk of AD.
*Low serum vitamin D levels (&lt;30 ng/ml) and polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor have been associated with AD.
__Parkinson&#39;s Disease__
*Vitamin D deficiency appears to be common in Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) patients.
*Vitamin D has been shown to have antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, which may provide neuroprotection in PD.
__Huntington&#39;s Disease__
*Vitamin D deficiency is common among Huntington&#39;s disease patients, with up to 89% having insufficient levels (&lt;50 nmol/L).
*There is evidence of disease-specific alterations in bone metabolism and increased fracture risk in Huntington&#39;s disease patients, which may be related to vitamin D deficiency.
While these findings suggest a potential role for vitamin D in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, the causal link is still a matter of debate. Randomized clinical trials examining vitamin D supplementation in patients with these disorders are needed to determine the optimal timing, efficacy, and appropriate dosing.It is important to note that vitamin D interacts with various mechanisms and may be a potential multitargeted therapeutic option for prevention and protection from cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.
