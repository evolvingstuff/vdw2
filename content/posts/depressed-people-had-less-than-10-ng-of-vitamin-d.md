# Relationship Between Vitamin D Levels and Depressive Symptoms in Older Residents From a National Survey Population.

Psychosom Med. 2010 Jul 1

Department of Health Service and Population Research (R.S.), King's College London (Institute of Psychiatry), London, United Kingdom; and the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health (V.H.), Royal Free and University College London Medical School, University College London, United Kingdom.

Objective: To investigate the association between vitamin D deficiency and depressive symptoms in a national community sample of older people. Vitamin D deficiency is common in older people with potential effects on mood. 

Methods: Data were analyzed from 2070 participants aged >/=65 years who had participated in the 2005 Health Survey for England. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) had been measured. Covariates included age, sex, social class, season of examination, and physical health status. 

Results: Depressive symptoms were associated with clinical vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D levels <10 ng/mL; present in 9.8%) independent of other covariates but not with broader deficiency states. This association was not modified by season of examination. 

Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with late-life depression in northern latitudes. PMID: 20595420
