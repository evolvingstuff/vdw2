#### [It appears that no Vitamin D capsule has been approved for sale in Canada with > 1,000 IU](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/natural-non-prescription/applications-submissions/product-licensing/licensed-natural-health-products-database.html)

Each product > 1,000 IU apparently must be individually approved for sale in Canada 

And the label must have the Canadian approval #

&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus a > 1,000 IU Vitamin D supplier must make a special label for Canada or have the Canadian # on all of their labels

#### It appears that the law is selectively implemented

* 5,000 IU capsules are sold on Amazon Canada

* [WalMart largest size 1,000 IU](https://www.walmart.ca/search/%20%20%20%22vitamin%20d%22)

* [Costco largest size 1,000 IU](https://www.costco.ca/vitamin-d.html)

* [Well Ca largest size 1,000 IU](https://well.ca/categories/vitamin-d_245.html?display_pages=1)

* [USANA.CA largest size 1,000 IU](https://bestsupplementsonline.ca/en/product/usana-vitamin-d/#)

 **Note: The [College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia](https://www.cpsbc.ca/) (CPSBC) fingered the offending supplier** 

Note: New Zealand is another country which limits capsule size to 1,000 IU
