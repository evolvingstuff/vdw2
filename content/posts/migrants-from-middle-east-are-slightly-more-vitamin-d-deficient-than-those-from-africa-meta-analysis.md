 **Highlights** 

•Meta-analysis suggests increased prevalence of VDD in dark-skinned migrants

•VDD is associated with increased time in host country

•VDD is increased in extended Middle East compared to sub-Saharan Africa

Background

Prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency varies among migrants from different geographical regions.

Objective

To estimate the pooled prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency among dark-skinned migrants

Design

A Meta-analysis using meta regression was undertaken to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in dark-skinned migrant populations. Prevalence was also determined by study characteristics including study methodology, age of populations examined and length of time in migrated country.

Results

A total of 36 studies were identified in non-pregnant populations. The total number of VDD cases across these studies was 9562 out of 13974 total population. Pooled prevalence in dark skinned migrants, adjusted for latitude of study country, was estimated at 77% (95% CI: 70-84%). Examination of studies where migrants from both Sub-Saharan Africa and the extended Middle East were examined (n=7) showed immigrants from the extended Middle East had a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency 65% (95% CI: 45-94%)
