#### PFAS decreases Vitamin D levels in postmenopausal women - March 2025

 **Associations of exposure to individual polyfluoroalkyl substances and their mixtures with vitamin D biomarkers in postmenopausal women** 

Ecotoxicol Environ Saf . 2025 Mar 27:294:118103. [doi: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118103](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118103)

The potential impact of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on vitamin D status in postmenopausal women remains unexplored. This study examined the effects of individual PFAS and their combined exposures on vitamin D biomarkers among 2114 postmenopausal women utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2003-2018. The serum levels of four PFAS compounds, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were assessed alongside the 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> level. 

Our findings indicated that elevated log-transformed PFAS concentrations were significantly associated with 

reduced 25(OH)D levels (

* βPFOS: -15.969, 95 % CI: -19.154, -12.785; 

* βPFOA: -17.288, 95 % CI: -22.446, -12.131; 

* βPFNA: -8.510, 95 % CI: -12.148, -4.871; 

* βPFHxS: -4.056, 95 % CI: -7.003, -1.110) 

and increased odds of vitamin D deficiency (

* ORPFOS: 2.495, 95 % CI: 1.685, 3.694; 

* ORPFOA: 3.146, 95 % CI: 1.823, 5.429; 

* ORPFNA: 1.906, 95 % CI: 1.357, 2.677; 

* ORPFHxS: 1.480, 95 % CI: 1.109, 1.976). 

These associations were modified by race, the family incomepoverty ratio and the survey cycle. Notably, non-Hispanic White individuals presented a stronger inverse association between PFOS exposure and 25(OH)D levels. Bayesian kernel machine regression and weighted quantile sum analyses demonstrated that the effects of exposure to mixtures of the four studied PFAS were consistent with the effects of exposure to individual PFAS. These findings indicate that exposure to individual PFAS, particularly PFOA and PFOS, and their four mixtures may adversely affect serum 25(OH)D concentrations in postmenopausal women, underscoring the need for further investigation into the potential impact of PFAS on vitamin D status in this population.

#### PFAS associated with lower vitamin D - June 2023

 **Combining the targeted and untargeted screening of environmental contaminants reveals associations between PFAS exposure and vitamin D metabolism in human plasma** 

Environ Sci Process Impacts . 2023 Jun 21;25(6):1116-1130. [doi: 10.1039/d3em00060e.](https://doi.org/10.1039/d3em00060e.)

Henrik Carlsson 1, Akshai Parakkal Sreenivasan 1, Ida Erngren 1, Anders Larsson 1, Kim Kultima 1

We have developed, validated, and applied a method for the targeted and untargeted screening of environmental contaminants in human plasma using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The method was optimized for several classes of environmental contaminants, including PFASs, OH-PCBs, HBCDs, and bisphenols. One-hundred plasma samples from blood donors (19-75 years, men n = 50, women n = 50, from Uppsala, Sweden) were analyzed. Nineteen targeted compounds were detected across the samples, with 18 being PFASs and the 19th being OH-PCB (4-OH-PCB-187). Ten compounds were positively associated with age (in order of increasing p-values: PFNA, PFOS, PFDA, 4-OH-PCB-187, FOSA, PFUdA, L-PFHpS, PFTrDA, PFDoA, and PFHpA; p-values ranging from 2.5 × 10-5 to 4.67 × 10-2). Three compounds were associated with sex (in order of increasing p-values: L-PFHpS, PFOS, and PFNA; p-values ranging from 1.71 × 10-2 to 3.88 × 10-2), all with higher concentrations in male subjects compared with female subjects. Strong correlations (0.56-0.93) were observed between long-chain PFAS compounds (PFNA, PFOS, PFDA, PFUdA, PFDoA, and PFTrDA). In the non-targeted data analysis, fourteen unknown features correlating with known PFASs were found (correlation coefficients 0.48-0.99). Five endogenous compounds were identified from these features, all correlating strongly with PFHxS (correlation coefficients 0.59-0.71). 

 **Three of the identified compounds were vitamin D3 metabolites** , and two were diglyceride lipids (DG 24:6;O). The results demonstrate the potential of combining targeted and untargeted approaches to increase the coverage of compounds detected with a single method. This methodology is well suited for exposomics to detect previously unknown associations between environmental contaminants and endogenous compounds that may be important for human health.

 **Conclusion** 

Computational modeling predicts that a large number of PFASs of commercial and regulatory

importance may impact the function of the vitamin D receptor and interfere with the beneficial

effects of vitamin D3. This may lead to increased osteoporosis and impaired immune function, two

adverse effects that have been observed in epidemiological studies of humans exposed to PFASs.

validation of these in silico findings should be a high priority

Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in industrial and commercial products. Previous research has shown that other endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A may alter circulating levels of vitamin D; however, no research has examined associations between PFAS and vitamin D biomarkers. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 7040 individuals aged 12 years and older participating in the 2003-2010 cycles of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> were measured in serum samples. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate covariate-adjusted differences in total 25(OH)D or prevalence odds of vitamin D deficiency per log2 change in PFAS concentrations. We also assessed potential effect measure modification by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. PFAS were detected in over 98% of the samples. In adjusted models, each 2-fold increase in PFOS was associated with 0.9 nmol/L (95% CI: 0.2, 1.5) lower total 25(OH)D concentrations, with associations significantly stronger among whites (β: -1.7; 95% CI: -2.6, -0.7) and individuals older than 60 years of age (β: -1.7; 95% CI: -2.9, -0.5). Each 2-fold increase in PFHxS was associated with 0.8 nmol/L (95% CI: 0.3, 1.3) higher total 25(OH)D, and this association was not modified by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. PFOA and PFNA were not associated with total 25(OH)D. When assessing prevalence odds of vitamin D deficiency, we observed similar patterns of association with PFAS concentrations. Our results suggest that some PFAS may be associated with altered vitamin D levels in the United States population, and associations may vary by chemical, age, and race/ethnicity. Prospective epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our findings and determine their implications for vitamin D-associated health outcomes in children and adults.

Purpose

Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Toxicological studies indicate that PFAS accumulates in bone tissue and could cause alterations in bone metabolism. The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between PFAS exposure and bone status in a cohort of young men resident in a well-defined area with high PFAS environmental pollution.

Bone status was assessed in 117 subjects aged 18–21 by quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at the heel. Subjects underwent an accurate medical visit. Socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and medical histories were collected. We also verified the interaction between PFAS and hydroxyapatite by computational modelling. The organic anion-transporting peptide (OATP), the putative transporter of PFAS, was evaluated by qPCR in bone biopsies from femoral heads discarded during arthroplasty in three male subjects.

Results

Exposed subjects showed significantly lower stiffness index, which resulted in lower t-score and higher prevalence of subjects at 

medium-high risk of fracture 

* (23.6%) compared with controls 

* (9.7%). 

Data from computational modelling suggested that PFOA exhibits a high affinity for hydroxyapatite, since the estimated change in free energy is in the order of that exhibited by bisphosphonates. Finally, we observed consistent expression of OATP1A2 gene in primary human osteoblasts.

Conclusions

This is the first study reporting increased osteoporosis risk in young men exposed to PFAS and provide preliminary information on molecular mechanisms that could explain this observation, in agreement with previous studies on animal models and humans. However, these results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional study design and the small number of cases.

#### Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and Your Health - CDC 2019

 **[Clipped from CDC web page - Oct 2019](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects.html)** 

Some, but not all, studies in humans with PFAS exposure have shown that certain PFAS may:

* affect growth, learning, and behavior of infants and older children

* lower a woman’s chance of getting pregnant

* interfere with the body’s natural hormones

* increase cholesterol levels

* affect the immune system

* increase the risk of cancer

#### Iodine reduces Fluorine - which may be the P<span style="color:#F06;">F</span>AS problem

Note:  **[Iodine](/tags/iodine.html)**  has decreased a lot in the past 30 years

Less Iodine in bread and milk

Less iodine in salt now:  

&nbsp; virtually none in commercially prepared foods

&nbsp; hardly any in salt that has been on the shelf for > 1 year
