BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D regulates the human genome and it is thought to influence the fetal growth and development, but its relation to early ultrasound fetal measures is still unknown.

OBJECTIVE:

To assess first trimester 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> maternal serum status and correlate with ultrasound crown-rump length (CRL) and nuchal translucency (NT) measurements.

METHOD:

In this cross-sectional study, women with singleton pregnancies undergoing the first trimester standard two-dimensional ultrasound scan for fetal anomalies were included: CRL (n = 498) and NT (n = 487). Concomitantly, maternal serum 25(OH)D levels were also measured.

RESULTS:

Median serum 25(OH)D levels for the entire sample (n = 498) was 27.4 ng/mL (interquartile range 20.9-32.7). Serum 25(OH)D was adequate (? 30 ng/mL) in only 36.1% of gravids, whereas levels were found to be insufficient (20-29.99 ng/mL) in 41.2% and deficient (< 20 ng/mL) in 22.7%. No significant correlation was found between the serum 25(OH)D levels and the measured ultrasound parameters.

CONCLUSION:

First trimester 25(OH)D levels did not correlate to fetal ultrasound measurements.
