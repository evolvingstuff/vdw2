 **A Hormone That's Crucial For Deep, Restorative Sleep** 

Vitamin D is not really a vitamin. Instead, it is a powerful hormone that we produce when we are exposed to sunlight, and it has effects throughout our bodies. If vitamin D levels are high, this signals that it is summertime, food is plentiful, and it is time to be healthy, happy, and active.

The quality of our sleep also responds to vitamin D signals. By acting on special receptors in the brain, vitamin D ensures that we get enough deep, restorative sleep, instead of light, fragmented sleep. Through deep sleep, we repair our bodies and produce the hormones that we need during the day in order to be healthy. Without enough deep sleep, we don’t get rested, regardless of how long we stay in bed. 

The Problem Is That Most Of Us Are Deficient

Very few people living in modern societies have adequate vitamin D levels. Most of us are not exposed to sunlight under the right conditions to produce optimal levels naturally. On the other hand, foods that are fortified with vitamin D are completely inadequate as supplements. 

The reason for this is that official recommendations for vitamin D levels are too low. They only take into account the role of vitamin D in bone health, and not its important role in regulating sleep. Even if you are supplementing with vitamin D, chances are that you are far from the optimal range as far as your sleep is concerned.

As a result, many of us suffer from sleep disorders, and we have even accepted this as normal, or as our own fault. Waking up often during the night, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, memory problems, and a cascade of other health issues can all be caused by a vitamin D deficiency and the resulting poor and non-restorative sleep. 

It's Possible To Drastically Improve Your Sleep

Since vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a hormone, it's the body's internal levels that are important, and not how much you take each day. The good news is you can increase your vitamin D stores to the proper level quickly, and see big improvements in your sleep.

In The Better Sleep Vitamin, author Kathy Aquino walks you through her experience of improving her own sleep by regulating her vitamin D levels. She lays out everything you need to know about optimizing your vitamin D levels and improving your sleep. Here is just a part of what you will learn:

the optimal vitamin D level in order to improve sleep

how to naturally increase your body's vitamin D levels

the different kinds of vitamin D supplements, and which ones you should take

how to test whether you have achieved optimal levels

what happens if you get too much vitamin D

how to avoid side effects of vitamin D supplementation

other minerals and vitamins that are crucial for the proper use of vitamin D
