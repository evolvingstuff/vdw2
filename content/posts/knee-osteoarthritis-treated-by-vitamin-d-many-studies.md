Background: The impact of knee osteoarthritis on individuals’ daily functioning is significant. In recent years, Vitamin D supplements cure osteoarthritis has garnered attention from medical professionals and patients due to its simplicity and portability. Several systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) have examined the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for knee osteoarthritis, yet there is variability in their methodology and quality.

Objective: To search, gather, and analyze data on the characteristics and quantitative results of SR/MA in patients with KOA treated with Vitamin D supplementation, and objectively evaluate the efficacy of supplements. Then, provides clinical evidence and recommendations the clinical use of vitamin D supplementation.

Methods: Two individuals reviewed and collected data from four databases until October 2023. AMSTAR-2, ROBIS, PRISMA 2020, and GRADE tools were used to evaluate the methodological quality, bias risk, reporting quality, and evidence strength of all SR/MA. Additionally, we applied the corrected covered area (CCA) method to measure overlap in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cited among the SR/MA.

Results: **3 SRs and 6 MAs were included in the analysis** : 3 studies were low quality by AMSTAR-2, and 6 studies were very low quality. According to ROBIS, 6 studies were high-risk and 3 were low-risk. In PRISMA 2020 reporting quality, most studies showed deficiencies in comprehensive literature search strategy, reasons for literature exclusion, data preprocessing for meta-analysis, exploration of reasons for heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, publication bias, and disclosure of funding and conflicts of interest. Grading the quality of evidence in GRADE consisted of 5 items of moderate quality, 14 items of low quality, and 10 items of very low quality. Bias risk and imprecision were the main factors for downgrading. The calculation of RCT overlap between SR/MA using CCA showed a high degree of overlap.

Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation may show potential efficacy in ameliorating symptoms of KOA. The evidence indicates that Vitamin D supplements for knee osteoarthritis can improve patients’ Total WOMAC scores and synovial fluid volume in the joints. Nevertheless, due to the generally low quality of current studies, future research should prioritize improving the quality of primary studies to establish the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for KOA with more robust scientific evidence.

#### Knee Osteoarthritis 1.7 more likely if low Vitamin D - Jan 2024

 **Relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis: A retrospective study on 3424 subjects** 

Technol Health Care. 2024 Jan 4. [doi: 10.3233/THC-230802](https://doi.org/10.3233/THC-230802)  PDF Price: EUR 27.50

Background: The extent of the association between vitamin D deficiency and knee osteoarthritis remains inadequately understood.

Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between vitamin D levels and knee osteoarthritis through a cross-sectional analysis.

Methods: This retrospective study involved an analysis of knee radiographs and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-(OH) vitamin D3) levels in a cohort of 3424 individuals (2901 women and 523 men). Knee osteoarthritis severity was evaluated using the Kellgren-Lawrence radiological scoring system.

Results: Of the participants, 49.2% (n= 1,683) were diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. Among these patients, the levels of adjusted 25-(OH) vitamin D3 were significantly lower (p< 0.001). Regression analysis revealed a significant association between vitamin D deficiency and knee osteoarthritis, with an adjusted odds ratio  **(OR) of 1.7** (95% CI: 1.5-2.0; p< 0.001). Notably, a stronger association was observed between vitamin D deficiency and knee osteoarthritis in women under 65 compared to those aged 65 and above.

Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Maintaining adequate serum 25-(OH) vitamin D3 levels may prevent knee osteoarthritis, especially in women below 65.

#### Both Vitamin D and Magnesium appear to be needed if have Knee Osteoarthritis - Oct 2023

 **Investigation of the relationship between magnesium level and vitamin D, bone mineral density, and chronic diseases in patients with knee osteoarthritis

Magnes Res. 2023 Jun 1;36(2):40-48. [doi: 10.1684/mrh.2023.0515](https://doi.org/10.1684/mrh.2023.0515) PDF behind paywall

The maintenance of various physiological cellular processes requires mineral magnesium (Mg). The purpose of the study was to determine a possible association between Mg level and vitamin D levels, bone mineral density (BMD), chronic diseases, and radiographic stage in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The study included 98 individuals (62 female and 36 male) who had been diagnosed with at least grade 1 knee OA. Age, sex, smoking, body mass index (BMI), family history of osteoporosis, menopausal status, duration of menopause, the presence of chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism) and radiological stage of knee OA were gathered from all patients. Also, serum calcium, Mg, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25(OH)-vitamin D levels were recorded. Additionally, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to measure the BMD of the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4) and femoral neck as well as anteroposterior radiography of the knee in all patients. T scores ≤-2.5 were accepted as evidence of osteoporosis. The mean age of the study population was 59.15 ± 10.58 years. 

The level of Mg significantly correlated with age, smoking, presence of chronic disease, duration of menopause, the level of vitamin D and PTH, and femoral neck T score (p<0.05). This study provides data supporting the relationship between magnesium levels and PTH and vitamin D levels, bone mineral density, and chronic disease. Future research is needed to examine the potential link between knee osteoarthritis and magnesium status.

#### Knee osteoarthritis pain reduced by 4,000 IU of Vitamin D for 3 months (35 ng avg.) – Dec 2022** The influence of vitamin D supplementation on the expression of mediators of inflammation in knee osteoarthritis **Immunol Res . 2022 Dec 26. [doi: 10.1007/s12026-022-09354-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-022-09354-0)

This trial aimed to determine the possible therapeutic and immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D3 in patients with knee OA. In this open-label clinical trial, symptoms were assessed over 3 months in patients with primary knee OA receiving oral vitamin D3 4000 IU/day. Clinical response was evaluated at baseline and 3 months using WOMAC subscores and VAS. Serum levels of cytokines IL-1ß, TNF-a, IL-13, IL-17, IL-33, IL-4, and IL-10 were determined by ELISA method. Eighty patients with knee OA were included. All 80 completed the study; the median 25(OH)D3 level was 23.1 ng/ml at baseline and increased by 12.3 ng/ml after treatment. Vitamin D3 after 3 months of supplementation induced a significant reduction in VAS pain and WOMAC subscores. Using OMERACT-OARSI criteria, 86.7% of patients treated with vitamin D3 responded to treatment. At the end of 3 months, systemic values of IL-1ß (p < 0.01), IL-23 (p < 0.01), and IL-33 (p < 0.01) were significantly increased, values of TNF-a (p < 0.01), IL-13 (p < 0.01), and IL-17 (p < 0.01) were significantly decreased, while value of IL-4 was not significantly changed. No adverse events were detected. Treatment with vitamin D is associated with improvement in pain, as well as stiffness and physical function. Vitamin D supplementation increased systemic values of IL-33. Our results indicate that vitamin D3 supplementation may be used as a novel therapeutic in knee OA. Future studies are needed to investigate a potential role of IL-33 in the pathogenesis of knee OA.
