#### The 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 reduces dengue virus infection in human myelomonocyte (U937) and hepatic (Huh-7) cell lines and cytokine production in the infected monocytes.

Antiviral Res. 2012 Apr;94(1):57-61. [doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.02.006.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.02.006.) Epub 2012 Feb 22.

Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral infection in humans. Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D influences virus replication. In this work, the effect of vitamin D treatment on dengue virus infection in human hepatic Huh-7 cells and on virus infection and cytokine production in the human monocytic U937 cells was evaluated. Exposure to 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, resulted in a  **significant reduction in the number of infected cells** , in conditions where cell viability was not affected. Viral replication in monocytic cells was more susceptible to vitamin D3 than replication in the hepatic cells. Moreover, vitamin D3 significantly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-1β) produced by infected U937 cells. 

 **These results suggest that vitamin D3 may represent a potentially useful antiviral compound.**

 Active vitamin D must be used in the lab, as the lab has no liver and kidney to activate regular vitamin D**
