Background

: Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies (FAs) are increasingly common among US children and adults. Not only can living with FA impose considerable physical health impacts, it also imposes economic burden and can negatively impact quality of life. Limited data indicate that allergy to multiple foods (multi-FA) also may be common, but much remains unknown about its distribution and determinants.

Objective

: We aimed to characterize the prevalence, characteristics, determinants, psychosocial burden, and distribution of multi-FA among a large, nationally representative sample of US children and adults.

Methods

: A US population-based survey was administered. Estimates of multi-FA prevalence, conditional frequencies of multi-FA combinations and associated factors were derived. Latent class analyses (LCA) were conducted using 9 dichotomized indicators of specific FA prevalence, which were used to determine factors associated with latent class membership and characterize FA-related psychosocial burden within each class.

Results

:  **Surveys were completed for 38,408 children and 40 443 adults** . Among children and adults meeting established symptom-report criteria for FA, an estimated 40% and 48% had multi-FA, respectively. Among pediatric and adult populations with convincing FAs, the lifetime reported prevalence of physician-diagnosed atopic comorbidities increased significantly as the number of reported current convincing FAs increased, as did the proportion reporting multi-FA-related healthcare utilization and higher perceived psychosocial burden. LCA suggested the existence of four key latent phenotypes of multi-FA: milk/egg-dominant, seafood-dominant, peanut/tree nut-dominant, and broadly multi-food allergic.

Conclusion

: The US population-level burden of multi-FA is high among both children and adults and data indicate the presence of four major phenotypes of multi-FA in both populations

##### Study report: 2 in 5 Kids Have Multiple Food Allergies — and It’s Taking a Toll on Their Mental and Physical Health

 **[Childrens Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/food-allergies-kids-mental-physical-health/?utm_source=salsa&eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=02c425c9-427b-4dbc-bc7d-86f33ed2e158)** 

* "According to Kennedy, in 1968, the rate of chronic disease in the U.S. was 

   * 6% among children. 

   * By 1986, that had risen to 11.8% and 

   * by 2006, it was up to 54%. "

* "Recent research by Brian S. Hooker, Ph.D., P.E., CHD’s chief scientific officer, found that fully vaccinated children were  **4.31 times more likely to suffer from serious allergies**  (requiring an epi-pen) compared to their unvaccinated counterparts."
