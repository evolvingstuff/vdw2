Recent studies suggest that vitamin D may be associated with reduced breast cancer risk, but most studies have evaluated only dietary vitamin D intake. The associations among ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, factors related to cutaneous vitamin D production, and breast cancer risk were evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Ontario, Canada, between 2003 and 2004 (n = 3,101 cases and n = 3,471 controls). 

Time spent outdoors was associated with reduced breast cancer risk during 4 periods of life ( **>21 vs. ?6 hours/week**  age-adjusted odds ratio 

* (OR) = 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 0.85 in the teenage years; 

* OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.76 in the 20s-30s; 

* OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.88 in the 40s-50s; and 

* OR =  **0.50** , 95% CI: 0.37, 0.66 in the 60s-74 years). 

Sun protection practices and ultraviolet radiation were not associated with breast cancer risk. A combined solar vitamin D score, including all the variables related to vitamin D production, was significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk. These associations were not confounded or modified by menopausal status, dietary vitamin D intake, or physical activity. This study suggests that factors suggestive of increased cutaneous production of vitamin D are associated with reduced breast cancer risk.
