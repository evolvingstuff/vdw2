OBJECTIVES: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. There has been an increase in testing for vitamin D with a concomitant increase in costs. While individual factors are significantly linked to vitamin D status, prior studies have not yielded a model predictive of vitamin D status or 25(OH)D levels. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a prediction model of vitamin D could be developed using extensive demographic data and laboratory parameters.

METHODS:  Patient data from 6  **Veterans Administration Medical Centers**  were extracted from medical charts.

RESULTS: : For the 14,920 available patients, several factors including 

* triglyceride level, 

* Race, 

* total cholesterol, 

* body mass index, 

* calcium level, and

* number of missed appointments 

were significantly linked to vitamin D status. 

However, these variables accounted for  **less than 15% of the variance in vitamin D levels** . 

While the variables correctly classified vitamin D deficiency status for 71% of patients, only 33% of those who were actually deficient were correctly identified as deficient.

CONCLUSION: : Given the failure to find a sufficiently predictive model for vitamin D deficiency, we propose that there is no substitute for laboratory testing of 25(OH)D levels. A baseline vitamin D 3 daily replacement of 1000-2000 IU initially with further modification based on biannual testing appears to factor in the wide variation in dose response observed with vitamin D replacement and is especially important in high-risk groups such as ethnic minorities.
