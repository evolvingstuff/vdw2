Abstract

BACKGROUND:

The optimal public health strategy for maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations in schoolchildren in Mongolia is unknown.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective was to compare the effectiveness of different supplement and fortified milk regimens to increase 25(OH)D concentrations in Mongolian schoolchildren.

DESIGN:

Twenty-one classrooms of 579 children aged 9-11 y were randomized to interventions with an equivalent content of vitamin D(3): 1) a one-time seasonal supplement of 13,700 IU, 2) 300 IU/d from supplements, 3) 300 IU/d from fortified ultra-high-temperature pasteurized milk from the United States, 4) 300 IU/d from fortified pasteurized Mongolian milk, or 5) unfortified pasteurized Mongolian milk (control).

RESULTS:

In January, the mean (± SD) serum 25(OH)D concentration was 8 ± 4 ng/mL (20 ± 10 nmol/L), and 98% of the children had a concentration <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). In March, concentrations were 8 ± 4 ng/mL after unfortified milk, 20 ± 6 ng/mL after fortified Mongolian milk, 29 ± 10 ng/mL after fortified US milk, 21 ± 6 ng/mL after daily supplements, and 12 ± 4 ng/mL after seasonal supplements (each greater than unfortified milk, P < 0.01). Seasonal supplementation was less effective than was daily supplementation (P < 0.0001). Despite consuming daily supplements or fortified milk, 41% of the children still had concentrations <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). Children with lower baseline 25(OH)D concentrations experienced slightly larger 25(OH)D responses to intervention than did children with higher concentrations (P = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS:

In this population with extremely low vitamin D concentrations, delivery of 300 IU vitamin D/d via supplements or in fortified milk improved 25(OH)D concentrations but failed to raise concentrations uniformly to >20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L). The daily low-dose intervention was superior to the seasonal larger-dose intervention. Higher doses may be needed to prevent deficiency in schoolchildren in Mongolia and at other northern latitudes. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00886379.
