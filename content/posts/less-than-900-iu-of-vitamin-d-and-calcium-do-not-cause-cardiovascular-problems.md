*  **It is amazing that they make the statement that (any amount) of Vitamin D and Calcium do not cause problems when most of the studies they considered used 400 IU and only one used 800 IU.** 

* Very few people nowadays use such small vitamin D doses

* The data on how much was used was in not in their study, but was hidden in another publication.

* It may be that Calcium along with large amounts of Vitamin D do not cause cardiovascular problem, but this publication does not address that concern

* Note: Both [Vitamin K2](/tags/vitamin-k2.html) and [Organic Calcium](/posts/calcium-from-plants-might-be-ok) minimize or perhaps eliminate the problem

Description:

Calcium is the dominant mineral present in bone and a shortfall nutrient in the American diet. Supplements have been recommended for persons who do not consume adequate calcium from their diet as a standard strategy for the prevention of osteoporosis and related fractures. Whether calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation is beneficial or detrimental to vascular health is not known.

Methods:

The National Osteoporosis Foundation and American Society for Preventive Cardiology convened an expert panel to evaluate the effects of dietary and supplemental calcium on cardiovascular disease based on the existing peer-reviewed scientific literature. The panel considered the findings of the accompanying updated evidence report provided by an independent evidence review team at Tufts University.

Recommendation:

The National Osteoporosis Foundation and American Society for Preventive Cardiology adopt the position that there is moderate-quality evidence (B level) that calcium with or without vitamin D intake from food or supplements has no relationship (beneficial or harmful) to the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, mortality, or all-cause mortality in generally healthy adults at this time. In light of the evidence available to date, calcium intake from food and supplements that does not exceed the tolerable upper level of intake (defined by the National Academy of Medicine as 2000 to 2500 mg/d) should be considered safe from a cardiovascular standpoint.

Calcium is a component of the dominant mineral (hydroxyapatite) present in bone and a shortfall nutrient in the American diet (1). Supplements have been recommended for persons who do not consume adequate calcium from their diet as a standard strategy for the prevention of osteoporosis and related fractures. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center at Tufts University published an evidence report in 2009 (2) reviewing the existing data on the effect of both vitamin D and calcium on health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease. Since then, conflicting reports have suggested that calcium intake, particularly from supplements, may have either beneficial or harmful effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) contracted an independent evidence review team at Tufts University to update the 2009 AHRQ evidence report on cardiovascular disease outcomes and end points (2). The expert panel, informed by the updated report (3), was assembled by the NOF and American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC) and was ultimately responsible for writing this clinical guideline.
