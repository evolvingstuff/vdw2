The Italian Society for Osteoporosis, Mineral Metabolism and Bone Diseases (SIOMMMS) has elaborated the following guidelines about the definition, prevention and treatment of inadequate vitamin D status. The highlights are presented here. 

Daily vitamin D allowance ranges from 

* 1,500 IU (healthy adults) to 

* 2,300 IU (elderly with low calcium intake). 

Since the average Italian diet includes around 300 IU/day, 

* subjects with no effective sun exposure should be supplemented with 1,200-2,000 IU vitamin D per day. 

The serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels represents the most accurate way to assess vitamin D repletion, even though there are still no standardized assay methods. 

Conditions of “deficiency” and “insufficiency” are defined by the following ranges of 25(OH)D levels: less than 20 ng/ml and 20-30 ng/ml, respectively. 

In Italy, approximately 50% of young healthy subjects have vitamin D insufficiency during the winter months. 

The prevalence of deficiency increases with ageing, affecting almost all elderly subjects not on vitamin D supplements. 

When a condition of deficiency has been identified, a 

 **cumulative dose of 300,000-1,000,000 IU, over 1-4 weeks is recommended** . 

In subjects recently treated for deficiency-insufficiency, a 

 **maintenance dose of 800-2,000 IU/day (or weekly equivalent) is recommended** . 

In patients on daily doses over 1,000 IU, 25(OH)D levels should be checked regularly (e.g. once every two years). 

The highest tolerated daily dose has been identified as 4,000 IU/day. 

Vitamin D supplementation should be carefully monitored in patients at higher risk of vitamin D intoxication (granulomatosis) or with primary hyperparathyroidism. 

In pregnant women, vitamin D supplements should be given as in non-pregnant women, but bolus administration (i.e.: single dose >25,000 IU) should be avoided.
