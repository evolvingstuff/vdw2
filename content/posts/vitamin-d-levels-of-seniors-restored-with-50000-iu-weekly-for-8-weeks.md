Objectives

the possible therapeutic role of vitamin D in different kind of diseases explains the growing interest in this vitamin due to its pleiotropic effects. This short report shows preliminary results of prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in a group of patients and proposes a oral supplement therapy effective in correcting hypovitaminosis in a short time, without side effects.

Methods

243 patients (aged 26–93; 67 males) were enrolled at this study. We evaluated plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> with the following cut-off values: < 10ng/ml or <0–25 nmol/L (deficient), 10–30 ng/ml or 25–75nmol/L 30–50 (insufficient) and > 30 ng/ml or > 50 nmol/L (normal). The first 73 patients with hypovitaminosis D received at baseline 25,000 IU (Cholecalciferol) per os twice a month (Tp.A). The next patients (Tp.B) at baseline received a loading dose of  **50,000 IU once a week for 8 weeks** , followed by a maintenance dose of 25,000 IU twice a month.

Results

hypovitaminosis D is a widespread condition (i.e. 82.3%) not only in elderly (75.6% of 75 patients aged <65 yrs and 86.5% of 168 subjects aged >65 yrs). Preliminary results at 6 months show that Tp.B is more effective in correcting hypovitaminosis D (baseline 14.4 ± 5.3 ng/ml; 24 wk 43.3 ± 14.7 ng/ml; p<0.0001).

Conclusion

hypovitaminosis D is an important public health problem. We believe it is important to quickly achieve normal Vit. D plasma values in order to produce pleiotropic effects.

14 ng ==> 43 ng with 8 weeks @ 50,000 IU then 25,000 IU once every 2 weeks (how long?)

#### 400,000 IU is a very common loading dose to quickly restore vitamin D levels

 **Loading doses are givenover 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or as slowly as this study – 8 weeks** 

#### 400,000 dose does not weight very much

 **= 0.001 gram = 60X less than a single grain of salt**
