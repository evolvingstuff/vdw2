Background: Evidence is uncertain about the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and health outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

Objectives: We aimed to assess the association between vitamin D status and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We did a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science until May 2022. We selected 1) cohort studies investigating the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and mortality or cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and 2) randomized trials of vitamin D supplementation in these patients. We used random-effects pairwise meta-analyses to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results: 21 cohort studies and 6 randomized trials were included. Compared with sufficient vitamin D status (>50 nmol/L), the RR of all-cause mortality was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.49; n = 11 studies, GRADE = moderate) for vitamin D insufficiency (25 to <50 nmol/L), and 1.58 (1.33, 1.83; n = 16, GRADE = moderate) for deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Similar findings were observed for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but not for cancer mortality. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Dose-response meta-analyses indicated nonlinear associations, with the lowest risk at 25(OH)D ~60 nmol/L for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Supplementation with vitamin D did not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.16; risk difference per 1000 patients: 3 fewer, 95% CI: 16 fewer, 12 more; n = 6 trials with 7316 participants; GRADE = low) or the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity (very low- to low-certainty evidence).

Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected in patients with type 2 diabetes to reach normal serum 25(OH)D concentrations, preferably 60 nmol/L.
