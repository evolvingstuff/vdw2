Bauer, Laura Damschroder, Hildi Hagedorn, Jeffrey Smith & Amy M. Kilbourne</p><p>Background</p><p>The movement of evidence-based practices (EBPs) into routine clinical usage is not spontaneous, but requires focused efforts. The field of implementation science has developed to facilitate the spread of EBPs, including both psychosocial and medical interventions for mental and physical health concerns.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The authors aim to introduce implementation science principles to non-specialist investigators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to become familiar with this emerging field. This introduction is based on published literature and the authors’ experience as researchers in the field, as well as extensive service as implementation science grant reviewers.</p><p>Implementation science is “the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other EBPs into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services.” Implementation science is distinct from, but shares characteristics with, both quality improvement and dissemination methods. Implementation studies can be either assess naturalistic variability or measure change in response to planned intervention. Implementation studies typically employ mixed quantitative-qualitative designs, identifying factors that impact uptake across multiple levels, including patient, provider, clinic, facility, organization, and often the broader community and policy environment. Accordingly, implementation science requires a solid grounding in theory and the involvement of trans-disciplinary research teams.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The business case for implementation science is clear: As healthcare systems work under increasingly dynamic and resource-constrained conditions, evidence-based strategies are essential in order to ensure that research investments maximize healthcare value and improve public health. Implementation science plays a critical role in supporting these efforts.</p><hr><h4 id=closing-the-health-equity-gap-a-role-for-implementation-science--sept-2021>Closing the health equity gap: A role for implementation science? – Sept 2021</h4><p>PLOS <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003762>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003762</a>   <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/is-closing.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=the-coming-of-age-of-implementation-science-and-research-in-critical-care-medicine--aug-2021>The Coming of Age of Implementation Science and Research in Critical Care Medicine – Aug 2021</h4><p>Crit Care Med. 2021 Aug 1; 49(8): 1254–1275. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000005131>doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000005131</a>  <strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/coming-age-is-compresspdf.pdf>PDF</a></strong></p><p>Juliana Barr, MD, FCCM,1,2 Shirley S.

Implementation scientists can make a valuable contribution by mobilizing theory and improving practice. However, goals for an evidence-based system may be more appropriately achieved through greater outreach and collaboration, with methods that are flexible to support rapid implementation in complex adaptive systems. Collective learning and mutual trust can be cultivated by embedding researchers into healthcare services while offering greater opportunities for practitioners to learn about, and engage in, implementation research.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>To bridge the worlds of healthcare practice and IS, researchers could be more consistent in the relationships they build with professionals and the public, communicating through a shared language and co-joining practical approaches to effective implementation.

Vroom Ph.D., M.S. & Oliver T. Massey Ph.D.</p><p>It is well recognized that the use of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is critical to improving service outcomes for those receiving behavioral health services. However, EBPs are not easily implemented in behavioral health settings, and there are many challenges to supporting these services over time. Recently, research efforts in implementation science (IS) have greatly expanded our understanding of issues that influence the successful implementation of EBPs. Unfortunately, less effort has been devoted to translating this research theory on a practical level to help individual service entities solve the specific problems of putting programs into place. A process is needed where service organizations and practitioners can build their capacity, informed by IS research, to improve service outcomes. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the IS research base, provide an introduction to implementation practice, describe challenges confronting practitioners, and propose necessary steps in building organizational capacity that enables practitioners to implement the most effective services available.</p><hr><h4 id=vitamindwiki-belives-it-is-easier-to-go-from-bottom-up-rather-than-top-down>VitaminDWiki belives it is easier to go from bottom-up rather than top-down</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/20-reasons-for-not-taking-vitamin-d-debunked>20 reasons for not taking Vitamin D debunked</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/17-reasons-why-are-doctors-reluctant-to-accept-vitamin-d>17 reasons why are doctors reluctant to accept vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/do-not-expect-your-doctor-to-know-about-vitamin-d>Do not expect your doctor to know about vitamin D</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/do-not-expect-a-doctor-to-recommend-a-pill-which-will-eliminate-his-job-vitamin-d>Do not expect a doctor to recommend a pill which will eliminate his job (vitamin D)</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/curing-patients-is-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs>Curing patients is not a sustainable business model – Goldman Sachs – April 2018</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/vitamin-d-public-shouldnt-wait-for-doctors-to-usher-in-new-golden-era-of-preventive-medicine>VITAMIN D: Public Shouldn’t Wait For Doctors To Usher In New “Golden Era” Of Preventive Medicine</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/let-1000-die-from-vitamin-d-deficiency-rather-than-incur-1-lawsuit>Let 1000 die from vitamin D deficiency rather than incur 1 lawsuit</a></p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/survey-shows-dogma-not-data-can-dictate-doctors-decisions>Survey Shows Dogma Not Data Can Dictate Doctors&rsquo; Decisions - June 2010</a></p></li></ul></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>autoimmune</span>
