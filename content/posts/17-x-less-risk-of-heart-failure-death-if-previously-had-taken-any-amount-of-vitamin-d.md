A broad range of chronic conditions, including heart failure (HF), have been associated with vitamin D deficiency. Existing clinical trials involving vitamin D supplementation in chronic HF patients have been inconclusive. We sought to evaluate the outcomes of patients with vitamin D supplementation, compared with a matched cohort using real-world big data of HF hospitalization. This study was based on the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in the Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Datasets (JROAD-DPC). After exclusion criteria, we identified  **93,692 patients**  who were first hospitalized with HF between  **April 2012 and March 2017**  (mean age was 79 ± 12 years, and 52.2% were male). Propensity score (PS) was estimated with logistic regression model, with vitamin D supplementation as the dependent variable and clinically relevant covariates.

On PS-matched analysis with 10,974 patients, patients with vitamin D supplementation had 

* lower total in-hospital mortality (6.5 vs. 9.4%, odds ratio: 0.67, p < 0.001) and 

* in-hospital mortality within 7 days (0.9 vs. 2.5%, OR, 0.34, and 

* in-hospital mortality within 30 days 3.8 vs. 6.5%,  **OR: 0.56** , both p < 0.001)

In the sub-group analysis mortalities in patients with age < 75, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial arrhythmia, cancer, renin-angiotensin system blocker, and ß-blocker were not affected by vitamin D supplementation. Patients with vitamin D supplementation had a lower in-hospital mortality for HF than patients without vitamin D supplementation in the propensity matched cohort. The identification of specific clinical characteristics in patients benefitting from vitamin D may be useful for determining targets of future randomized control trials.

#### Suspect that something other than Vitamin D might have created the benefit

Example: Vitamin D may have been just one of many things that the person was doing to improve their health
