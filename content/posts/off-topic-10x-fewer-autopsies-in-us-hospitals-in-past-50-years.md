# [Without Autopsies, Hospitals Bury Their Mistakes](http://www.propublica.org/article/without-autopsies-hospitals-bury-their-mistakes%20) ProPublica Dec. 2011

## A few highlights from the excellent article

## Average number of autopsies in US (on patients who have been in hospital at least one day)

* Mid 20th century: half

* 2011: 5%

* Teaching hospitals: 20%

* Private and community hospitals 2011: close to zero %

## Reasons

* Insurers don’t pay for autopsies . (An autopsy costs about $1,275)

* Medicare does not pay for autopsies 

* Some fear autopsies  may reveal malpractice. (diagnostic/procedural errors)

I would not mind a decrease in autopsies, but a 2002 review of autopsies uncovered “major errors” in 1 out of every 4 autopsies 

Autopsy rate in England is apparently still about 20% - the UK has not ignored their laws the way the US has.
