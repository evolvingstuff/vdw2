 **Note** 

The savings due to Miscarriage and Stillbirth are so small that they can be ignored

Preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) have a lot in common.

Cost savings of preventing preterm and LBW is most likely less than the sum of of the two

The range is from  **$2,600 to $5,000** 

 **Let's conservatively assume the amortized savings due to Vitamin D for a pregnancy = $3,000** 

Also assume that the total cost of vitamin D, instruction, tests, overhead, and paying the pregnant woman to take it is $1,000

&nbsp; &nbsp; Could, for example, send a check of $546 to a pregnant woman with good level of vitamin D (> 40 ng)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $546 = $2 a day X  39 weeks

This would still leave  **$2,000 net profit**  per Vitamin-D-boosted pregnancy for a Health Insurance company or Health Maintenance Organization
