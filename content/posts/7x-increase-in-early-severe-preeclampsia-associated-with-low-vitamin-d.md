Objective Decreased maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and placenta growth factor (PlGF) have both been associated with the diagnosis of early onset severe preeclampsia (EOSPE). This investigation aimed to define the association of these biomarkers with EOSPE.

Study Design Patients with EOSPE (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 40) were recruited and information on demographics, outcomes, and plasma was collected at diagnosis of EOSPE or gestational age-matched controls. 25-OH-D was assessed by radioimmunoassay and reported in nanogram per milliliter. PlGF was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reported in picogram per milliliter. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare biomarkers between groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine associations between 25-OH-D or PlGF and the diagnosis of EOSPE.

Results In EOSPE, both 25-OH-D and PlGF were decreased significantly compared with controls. 

After controlling for age, race, body mass index, and gestational age at sample collection, both 25-OH-D (adjusted odds ratio 0.14 <span>[0.05, 0.36]</span>) and PlGF (adjusted odds ratio 0.03 <span>[0.01, 0.24]</span> were significantly associated with diagnosis of ESOPE (p < 0.001 for both markers).

Conclusion PlGF and 25-OH-D are both associated with the diagnosis of EOSPE. 

These biomarkers may be helpful in development of novel rapid diagnostic tests for preeclampsia.

### Another study in June 2013: 5X increase in Eclampsia if low vitamin D

Maternal vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as a risk factor for preeclampsia, but no significant studies have been conducted to evaluate its relationship with eclampsia. Our goal in this study was to assess the prevalence and potential risk of vitamin D deficiency for both preeclampsia and eclampsia in Bangladesh. Using a case-control design, we measured serum 25(OH)D levels in pregnant women receiving care at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital with preeclampsia (n=33), eclampsia (n=79), and normal pregnancy (controls, n=76). Odds of developing preeclampsia and eclampsia with vitamin D deficiency were calculated using logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was very high with more than 3 quarters (78%) of all subjects having a serum 25(OH)D level<30 ng/ml. The mean serum 25(OH)D level was 24.86 ng/ml in controls, 23.96 ng/ml in pre-eclamptic women, and 21.56 ng/ml in eclampsia patients. Comparing to those who had a serum 25(OH)D level of ≥30 ng/ml, the odds ratio (95% CI) of developing preeclampsia and  **eclampsia**  in mothers with vitamin D insufficiency were 3.9 (95% CI=1.18-12.87) and  **5.14**  (95% CI=1.98-13.37), respectively (adjusting for age, BMI and duration of pregnancy). 

The odds of developing preeclampsia and eclampsia may increase by up to 5-fold in women with vitamin D insufficiency. 

Since preeclampsia and eclampsia can lead to serious complications for both mother and the offspring, vitamin D may be supplemented during pregnancy in high risk populations to decrease these adverse consequences.
