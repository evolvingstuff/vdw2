#### Vitamin D3 a new drug against Candida albicans (petri dish) - Nov 2016

[Vitamin D3 a new drug against Candida albicans](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1156523316302232)

Journal de Mycologie Médicale / Journal of Medical Mycology,

http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycmed.2016.10.003 

Objective: In this study, we demonstrate that vitamin D3 had fungicidal activity against Candida albicans.

Material and methods: The susceptibility of the yeast strain to the vitamin D3 was investigated by the antimicrobial screening using modified agar diffusion method, minimum fungistatic concentrations (MFCs) and minimum fungicide concentrations (MFCC) of the vitamin D3 were determined by the broth dilution method.

Results: The antifungal activity indicted that 100 μg/ml of vitamin D3 had a power inhibition in the growth of C. albicans with zone of inhibition 12.5 mm and CMFC and CMFs were 1.58 ± 0.0764 μg/ml.

Conclusion: These values indicate that vitamin D3 can be considered to have fungicide activity. This antifungal effect may be due to the large lipsolubility of vitamin D3 changing the integrity of the cell membrane.

Improving your calcium absorption can help to accomplish this. Calcium is too large a molecule to be absorbed directly, so vitamin D is required to transport it across the intestinal membrane. However, vitamin D transports little calcium until it's activated fully by your kidneys. Increasing your kidneys' activation of vitamin D can be achieved by balancing your sodium and potassium intake to match the weather to which you're exposed. (For more on vitamin D and your kidneys' role in calcium absorption, see my book Eating Alive II).

#### Appears that Calcium is needed to reduce Candida Albicans, and vitamin D is needed to increase Calcium

"It might be a thyroid problem, lack of **zinc, magnesium, problems with resistance, lack of vitamin D**  or many, many others... generally, the healthy immune system should kill candida without problem."

#### Oral Candidiasis 5.7 X more likely if low vitamin D in person with HIV - 2012

 **Association among Vitamin D, Oral Candidiasis, and Calprotectinemia in HIV** 

J Dent Res. 2012 Jul; 91(7): 666–670. [doi:  10.1177/0022034512446342](https://doi.org/10.1177/0022034512446342) PMCID: PMC3383847

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with negative health outcomes, including infections. Vitamin D modulates inflammation and down-regulates the expression of calprotectin, a molecule which influences neutrophil functions and which has been linked to oral candidiasis (OC), the most prevalent oral lesion in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We hypothesized a positive association between vitamin D deficiency and OC, and that this effect was partially modulated by calprotectinemia. Plasma calprotectin and serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels were measured in stored samples from 84 HIV-seropositive Chicago women enrolled in the Oral Substudy of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). OC and vitamin D deficiency were diagnosed in, respectively, 14 (16.7%) and 46 (54.8%) of those studied. Vitamin D deficiency was positively associated with OC (p = 0.011) and with higher calprotectinemia (p = 0.019) in univariate analysis. After adjustment for CD4, HIV viral load, HIV treatment, and tobacco and heroin/methadone use, vitamin D deficiency remained a significant predictor of OC ( **OR 5.66** ; 95% confidence interval 1.01-31.71). This association weakened after adjustment for calprotectinemia, supporting a role for calprotectinemia as a moderator of this effect. These findings support studies to examine the effect of vitamin D status on calprotectinemia, neutrophil functions, and opportunistic mucosal infections in HIV.
