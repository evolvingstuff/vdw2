#### [Efficacy and Safety of High Dose Vitamin D Supplementation in Patients Undergoing HSCT](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03320915?sfpd_d=14)

1, 2, or 3 treatments of 200,000 IU of vitamin D in a year

&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 treatments: 600,000 IU/year = 1,600/day = not much, and not very frequent

Dr. Coimbra in Brazil uses about 60,000 IU of Vitamin D/day, about 40X more to "cure"
