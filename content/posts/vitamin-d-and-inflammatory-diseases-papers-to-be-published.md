### Call for Papers by Hindawi

The physiological importance of vitamin D serum levels extends far beyond the bone metabolism. Vitamin D has been associated with other inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and others. The key role of vitamin D in the immunologic system and inflammatory status remains under debate, coupled with vitamin D deficiency which is a global health problem; new information will aid the development of optimal vitamin D status in the treatment and control of inflammatory diseases.

We invite authors to submit original research and review articles that seek to define the interaction between vitamin D and inflammatory diseases. We are interested in articles that explore aspects of inflammatory status and vitamin D in humans and animal models.

#### Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

* Detecting vitamin D levels in inflammatory diseases

* Testing the efficacy of supplementation of vitamin D in inflammatory diseases

* Elucidating the association between vitamin D and different inflammatory diseases

* Identifying mechanisms of action of vitamin D in inflammatory diseases

* Cooperation between vitamin D and other inflammatory mediators

* Cooperation between vitamin D and other steroids in inflammatory diseases

* Vitamin D as a prognostic factor in inflammatory diseases
