#### Sun healing (Heliotherapy) used in many places over the past 3,000 years

The use of vitamin D by living organisms goes back 750,000,000 years

The use of the sun to heal started about 3,000 years ago

Then religions fround on sun therapy for 1000 years– too much like pagan sun worship.

#### Heliotherapy was very popular (for TB, etc.) before antibiotics were invented

 **[Heliotherapy: Benefits of the Sun Far and Beyond Vitamin D](http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/heliotherapy-benefits-of-the-sun-beyond-vitamin-d/)**  Probably Aug 2014

 **Heliotherapy had been used for:** 

Acne, psoriasis and other skin disorders

Muscular stimulation and relaxation

Seasonal Affective Disorder

Reducing body odor

Boosting the body’s immune system for the treatment of AIDS

Reducing bacteria count by as much as 50% from infections

Decontaminating blood transfusions

DNA repair

Hyperbilrubinemia (neonatal jaundice)

### [Heliotherapy History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy#History) Wikipedia  Dec 2016

* “Many ancient cultures practiced various forms of heliotherapy, including people of 

* Ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome.

The Inca, Assyrian and early German settlers also worshipped the sun as a health bringing deity. 

* Indian medical literature dating to 1500 BCE describes a treatment combining herbs with natural sunlight to treat non-pigmented skin areas. 

* Buddhist literature from about 200 CE and 10th-century Chinese documents make similar references.”

#### [The rise and fall of sunlight therapy](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/28/health/he-esoterica28) LA Times 2007

* “The patients were rolled onto sun-drenched, open-air balconies, wearing loincloths and covered from head to toe with white sheets. 

> On the first day of treatment, just their feet peeked out from under the sheets, and only for five minutes. 

> On day two, the sheets were pulled a little higher, and the patients were left in the sun a few minutes more. 

> By day five, only the patients' heads were covered, their bodies left to soak up sun for more than an hour. 

> After a few weeks, the patients were very tan -- and hopefully very healthy.
