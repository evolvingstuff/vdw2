Vitamin D regulates the pleiotropic effect to maintain cellular homeostasis and epidemiological evidence establishes an association between vitamin D deficiency and various human diseases. Here, the role of autophagy, the cellular self-degradation process, in vitamin D-dependent function is documented in different cellular settings and discusses the molecular aspects for treating 

* chronic inflammatory, 

* infectious diseases, and 

* cancer.

Vitamin D activates autophagy through a genomic and non-genomic signaling pathway to influence a wide variety of physiological functions of different body organs along with bone health and calcium metabolism. Moreover, it induces autophagy as a protective mechanism to inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune modulation. Furthermore, vitamin D and its receptor regulate autophagy signaling to control inflammation and host immunity by activating antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Vitamin D has been revealed as a potent anticancer agent and induces autophagy to increase the response to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs for potential cancer therapy. Increasing vitamin D levels in the human body through timely exposure to sunlight or vitamin D supplements could activate autophagy as part of the homeostasis mechanism to prevent multiple human diseases and aging-associated dysfunctions.

#### Tried vitamin D  + water fasting - Great! - Feb 2023

By the founder of VitaminDWiki, Henry Lahore

I have tried fasting many times in my life, but previous fasts only lasted about 1 day

The fasts  were stopped because of an extreme lack of energy

In Jan 2023, our son tried water fasts, which he started with a large dose of Vitamin D

His six fasts have been  extremely successful

* felt better,

* lasted 3-4 days each

* experience no energy/brain loss during the fast

* lost about 5 lbs on each fast

* did not feel especially hungry after the fast AND he kept the weight off  (20 lbs so far)

* felt that his brain was working much better after a fast, especially ones lasting 5 days

I added nanoemulsion vitamin D and ionized Magnesium several times each day during my fasts

I successfully had many 2-3-day water fasts

 **My results were similar to that of our son** 

[Nanoemulsion Vitamin D may be a substantially better form](/posts/nanoemulsion-vitamin-d-may-be-a-substantially-better-form)

Be sure to swish the milliliter of nanoD  in your mouth for a minute or two

This gets it directly into the bloodstream without being delayed by the stomach, intestines, lymph (?), liver and kidneys. 

 **Chart of the above is at:  
 [Permanent Weight Loss - lots of Vitamin D then water-fast (2 people so far) - July 2023](/posts/permanent-weight-loss-lots-of-vitamin-d-then-water-fast-2-people-so-far)** 

&nbsp; Note: Virtually every cell in your body has the ability to fully process vitamin D

#### Vitamin D also augments weight loss without fasting

Many studies have found that people who want to lose weight by calorie restriction or exercise have much more success when they add Vitamin D ( weeks or months before starting the weight loss plan unless they start with a loading dose)

[Weight loss and Vitamin D - many studies](/posts/weight-loss-and-vitamin-d-many-studies)

 **Have been unable to find anyone on the web who has tried Vitamin D + water fasting** 

Please email me if you have any data or experience <span>[hlahore@gmail.com]</span>
