People with stable CAD were mentally stressed

They were told to prepare a 2 minute speech in 3 minutes

Their Vitamin D levels dropped from 31 ng to 24 ng

Abstract does not indicate how quickly the drop occurred. – we assume hours to days

We wonder how many stress-related diseases result in lowered vitamin D levels.

BACKGROUND:

Mental stress-induced (MSIMI) or physical stress-induced (PSIMI) myocardial ischemia portends a worse prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, but its relationship to myocardial ischemia remains unclear. We hypothesized that vitamin D insufficiency will be associated with a higher prevalence of myocardial ischemia in patients with CAD.

METHODS:

In 255 patients with stable CAD, myocardial perfusion imaging was performed to assess ischemia in response to mental and physical stress protocols. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels below 30 ng/ml, collected on the day of stress testing.

RESULTS:

Mean (standard deviation) 25(OH)D level was 30.8 (12.8) ng/ml, and 139 (55%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency. MSIMI occurred in 30 (12%) patients and PSIMI in 67 (27%). Individuals with MSIMI had significantly lower levels of 25(OH)D as compared with those without MSIMI (24.0 <span>[8.6]</span> versus 31.7 <span>[12.9]</span>, p = .002). The prevalence of MSIMI was higher in those with as compared with those without vitamin D insufficiency (17% versus 6%, p = .009). Moreover, low 25(OH)D levels remained independently associated with MSIMI after adjusting for potential confounders. Conversely, 25(OH)D levels were similar between those with or without PSIMI (29.8 <span>[13.0]</span> versus 31.4 <span>[12.7]</span>, p = .37), as was the prevalence of PSIMI in those with or without vitamin D insufficiency (29% versus 24%, p = .42).

CONCLUSIONS:

Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with a higher prevalence of MSIMI but not PSIMI among stable patients with CAD. Whether this association serves as a potential mechanism linking low vitamin D status to adverse cardiovascular outcomes warrants further investigation.
