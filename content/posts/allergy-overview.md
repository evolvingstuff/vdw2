### Might peanut allergy be associated with low vitamin D?  asked Perplexity AI July 2024

There is evidence suggesting a potential association between peanut allergy and low vitamin D levels. Several studies have explored this relationship, indicating that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in the development of food allergies, including peanut allergy.

 **Evidence Supporting the Association** 

1.  **Australian Study** :

> An Australian study found that infants with low vitamin D levels were more likely to have egg or peanut allergies and multiple allergies compared to those with normal vitamin D levels. This suggests that vitamin D might have a protective role against the development of food allergies.

1.  **Role of Vitamin D in Immune Function** :

> Vitamin D is known to play a crucial role in the immune system. It helps modulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which are essential in preventing allergic reactions. Deficiency in vitamin D has been associated with increased autoimmunity and susceptibility to infections, which could indirectly contribute to the development of allergies.

1.  **Geographical and Seasonal Variations** :

> Research has shown that areas with lower ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which results in lower vitamin D synthesis, have higher rates of childhood food allergies, including peanut allergy. Additionally, being born in seasons with less UVR exposure (autumn or winter) has been linked to a higher risk of food allergies and anaphylaxis.

1.  **Direct Measures of Vitamin D** :

> Studies using direct measures of vitamin D from blood samples have shown an association between low vitamin D levels and increased risk of allergic sensitization in children and adolescents, as well as food allergies in infants.

1.  **Specific Study on Peanut Allergy** :

> A study by Mullins et al. found that higher neonatal 25(OH)D levels were associated with a reduced risk of peanut allergy in children. Specifically, levels of 75 to 99.9 nmol/L were linked to a reduced risk, while levels lower than 50 nmol/L did not show a significant difference from the reference group.

 **Contradictory Findings** 

While there is substantial evidence supporting the association between low vitamin D and increased risk of food allergies, including peanut allergy, some studies have presented contradictory findings. For example, some research suggests that higher vitamin D levels might increase the likelihood of allergic sensitization and food allergies. This indicates the need for further well-designed randomized controlled trials to clarify the relationship.

 **Conclusion** 

Overall, the current body of research suggests that there might be an association between low vitamin D levels and an increased risk of peanut allergy. However, the relationship is complex and not entirely understood, with some studies showing contradictory results. Ensuring adequate vitamin D levels through sensible sun exposure and dietary intake might be beneficial, but more research is needed to establish definitive guidelines and understand the underlying mechanisms

Current literature regarding the association of vitamin D insufficiency and food allergy is contradicting. The purpose of our study was to investigate this association. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA statement. PubMeD and Scopus databases were systematically searched for case–control studies investigating the association between pediatric food allergy and vitamin D insufficiency. Our search yielded 806 studies. Ten final studies were considered eligible for qualitative and quantitative analysis. 

Children with vitamin D insufficiency were found to have 68% more probability to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled OR: 1.68, 95% CI <span>[1.25–2.27]</span>, p-value: 0.001). 

In their second year of life they were 4 times more likely to present a food allergy episode (adjusted pooled  **OR: 4.06** , 95% CI <span>[1.93–8.56]</span>, p-value: < 0.001), and 56% more probable to develop food sensitization (OR: 1.56, 95% CI <span>[1.15–2.11]</span>, p-value: < 0.004). 

Children in Australia with vitamin D insufficiency were almost 4 times more likely to develop egg sensitization (adjusted OR: 3.79, 95% CI <span>[1.19–12.08]</span>, p-value: 0.024). 

Children with vitamin D insufficiency were almost twice as likely to have peanut sensitization (OR: 1.96, 95% CI <span>[1.08–3.57]</span>, p-value: 0.028).

Conclusion: Decreased maternal vitamin D levels and infant vitamin D insufficiency appear to increase the incidence of food allergies, particularly in the second year of life. To confirm this association, multicenter longitudinal studies are required.

</div>

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum vitamin D levels, sensitization to food allergens, and the severity of atopic dermatitis in infants.

STUDY DESIGN: We investigated serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) and specific immunoglobulin E levels to common or suspected food allergens in 226 infants with atopic dermatitis or food allergy. The severity of atopic dermatitis by the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index and amount of vitamin D intake was measured in subcohort children. Sensitization to food allergens was categorized by the number (non-, mono-, and poly-) of sensitized allergens and the degree (undetected-, low-, and high-level) of sensitization.

RESULTS: Significant differences in 25(OH)D levels were found between groups on number (P = .006) and degree (P = .005) of food sensitization. The polysensitization group had significantly lower levels of 25(OH)D than the nonsensitization (P = .001) and monosensitization (P = .023) group. High-level sensitization group had significantly lower 25(OH)D levels compared with undetected (P = .005) and low-level (P = .009) sensitization group. Vitamin D deficiency increased the risk of 

* sensitization to food allergens (OR 5.0; 95% CI 1.8-14.1), especially to 

* milk (OR 10.4; 95% CI 3.3-32.7) and 

* wheat (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.1-15.8). 

In addition, the9% of US adults believe they have a food allergy Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index was independently related to 25(OH)D levels after adjusting for the level of sensitization (adjusted R(2) = 0.112, P = .031).

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of sensitization to food allergens and that atopic dermatitis may be more severe in infants with vitamin D deficiency.

## Food allergies are associated with both Vitamin D and Vitamin D genes - 2018

 **Cellular and molecular mechanisms of vitamin D in food allergy** 

Journal of cellular and molecular medicine, DOI:10.1111/jcmm.13607

Ashlyn Poole, Yong Song, +2 authors Guicheng Brad Zhang

Food allergies are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in young children. Epidemiological evidence from the past decade suggests a role of vitamin D in food allergy pathogenesis. Links have been made between variations in sunlight exposure, latitude, birth season and vitamin D status with food allergy risk. Despite the heightened interest in vitamin D in food allergies, it remains unclear by which exact mechanism(s) it acts. An understanding of the roles vitamin D plays within the immune system at the cellular and genetic levels, as well as the interplay between the microbiome and vitamin D, will provide insight into the importance of the vitamin in food allergies. Here, we discuss the effect of vitamin D on immune cell maturation, differentiation and function; microbiome; genetic and epigenetic regulation (eg DNA methylation); and how these processes are implicated in food allergies.

BACKGROUND: Prenatal vitamin D status may influence offspring's respiratory and allergic outcomes; however, evidence is inconclusive. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels in maternal blood in pregnancy or cord blood at birth with the risk of offspring's respiratory and allergic conditions.

METHODS: Two independent researchers conducted systematic searches for observational studies published until May 2017 using defined keywords on vitamin D and health outcomes, including respiratory tract infections (RTIs), wheeze, asthma, atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and lung function. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.

RESULTS: A total of 34 from 547 retrieved articles were included. Increased prenatal exposure to 25(OH)D was inversely associated with risk of RTIs. Comparing the highest with the lowest category of 25(OH)D levels, the pooled odds ratio was  **0.64**  (95% CI 0.47, 0.87). A positive borderline association was found for lung function at school age (FEV1 z-score coefficient 0.07, 95% CI -0.01, 0.15). No associations were found for wheeze, asthma, atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis, and allergic sensitization.

CONCLUSION: The introduction of public health measures to tackle vitamin D status in pregnancy may reduce the burden of RTIs in offspring. Current evidence does not support an impact on asthma and allergy.
