Summary</h2>

<p id="spara80">

Improved understanding of the association between tuberculosis and vitamin D is needed to inform clinical practice. Vitamin D has both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects relevant to human antimycobacterial responses. Ultraviolet radiation, the main source of vitamin D, also induces immunomodulation and could affect the relation between vitamin D and tuberculosis. Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in patients with tuberculosis have produced largely negative results, prompting the review of dosing regimens—an explanation for low 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in patients with active tuberculosis is also needed. The reporting of vitamin D deficiency needs to address assay inaccuracies, rising thresholds to define sufficiency, and scarce knowledge of the concentrations needed for optimum immune responses. Future research to measure the effect of the inflammatory setting on serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, at tuberculosis diagnosis and during recovery, could help to account for 25-hydroxyvitamin D changes in these concentrations in patients with tuberculosis. Studies into the role of vitamin D supplementation in latent tuberculosis justify clinical trials in this population, but pose methodological challenges. Vitamin D trials in patients with active tuberculosis should be done in well selected populations using adequate vitamin D doses, although such doses remain undefined.</p>

Questions about the relation between tuberculosis, vitamin D, and ultraviolet radiation are largely unexplored. These include reconciliation of contradictory immunological actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D related to the balance between innate immunity (antimicrobial peptides and macrophages in particular) and adaptive immunity, understanding of the immunological effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (a potentially important confounder of the vitamin D–tuberculosis relation), and consideration of alternative hypotheses that explain the common finding of low vitamin D status in patients with active tuberculosis. We reviewed the scientific literature to provide evidence, explore contradictions, and suggest alternative hypotheses.</p>

Background</h3>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para400">

When 7-dehydrocholesterol in the plasma membrane of human keratinocytes is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, it is converted to previtamin D<sub>3</sub>, followed by a thermal reaction to form vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol). Some foods contain vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, which is synthesised by plants after UVB irradiation; however, these only contribute small amounts of the total vitamin D requirements in most individuals. The physiological effects of D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> are interchangeable, although oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is more effective in raising serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration than is D<sub>2</sub>.<span id="bbib36"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib36" id="ancbbib36"><sup>36</sup></a></span> Vitamin D is fat soluble, and, as with the vitamin D metabolites, is carried in the circulation by hepatically produced vitamin D-binding protein. In the liver, vitamin D undergoes hydroxylation by a 25-hydroxylase to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is converted to the biologically active steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1α-hydroxylase enzyme. The actions of the hormone are mediated either through ligation with a nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) to regulate gene transcription, resulting in genomic responses, or via membrane rapid-response receptors.<span id="bbib37"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib37" id="ancbbib37"><sup>37</sup></a></span> These receptors are distributed in most human tissues. Thus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can be generated by tissues expressing 1α-hydroxylase and act via local VDRs. The 1α-hydroxylase gene, <em>CPY27B1,</em> is primarily expressed in the kidney under normal conditions. Expression in a wide range of other human cells, including activated macrophages, is important in disease states.<span id="bbib38"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib38" id="ancbbib38"><sup>38</sup></a></span> Production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in renal cells is under negative feedback control through induction by the hormone of 24-hydroxylase, which catabolises 25-hydroxyvitamin D as well as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Whether the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations regarded as sufficient for bone health are applicable to other vitamin D functions such as immunity, remains unknown. Part of the drive to increase recommended reference ranges of vitamin D, rather than the use of population distributions, derives from studies of bone biomarkers such as parathyroid hormone.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib52"><sup>52</sup></a></span> However, no such markers are available to estimate the optimum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration needed for the non-skeletal functions of vitamin D.

Sudden changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D from large doses of vitamin D could also be associated with adverse outcomes: a study in which 500 000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> boluses were given annually showed an association with increased risk of fall and fracture.<span id="bbib71"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib71" id="ancbbib71"><sup>71</sup></a></span> These uncertainties, and the limitations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D assays and changing reference ranges, should be considered when associations between tuberculosis and vitamin D are examined.</p>

Vitamin D gene polymorphisms</h3>

A contribution of vitamin D insufficiency to worse outcomes after infection with tuberculosis could be supported by finding an association with genetic polymorphisms within vitamin D-related genes.

The effect of supplemental vitamin D on in-vivo immune responses to <em>M tuberculosis</em> is rarely studied. One report included 192 tuberculosis contacts, randomly assigned to receive one oral dose of vitamin D (2·5 mg, 100 000 IU) or placebo.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib30" id="ancbbib30"><sup>30</sup></a></span> A substantial improvement in antimycobacterial immunity was noted in the vitamin D versus placebo group, as shown by the growth restriction of recombinant mycobacteria (BCG-lux assay) in whole blood taken from each patient. This response is regarded as a demonstration of innate immunity and, contrastingly, the acquired response (as measured by interferon gamma secretion after stimulation of blood cells with mycobacterial antigens in vitro) did not differ between the groups. Another study involved south Asian immigrants to the UK with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations who were UVB irradiated, resulting in an increase in these concentrations to about 50 nmol/L. However, no change in their antimycobacterial immunity, assessed by restriction of growth of BCG-lux, occurred.<span id="bbib93"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib93" id="ancbbib93"><sup>93</sup></a></span></p>

Ultraviolet radiation-induced immunological effects and tuberculosis</h2>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para500">

Ultraviolet radiation is the major source of vitamin D and its immunological effects should therefore be assessed alongside those of vitamin D.<span id="bbib94"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib94" id="ancbbib94"><sup>94</sup></a></span> Exposure of animals and human beings to ultraviolet light results in downregulation of T and B-cell response to various antigens, including tumour antigens, contact sensitisers, microorganisms, and alloantigens.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib25" id="ancbbib25"><sup>25</sup></a></span> Immunomodulation pathways vary depending on the antigen; the spectrum, dose and frequency of radiation exposure, time between exposure and application of the antigen, and the involvement of primary or memory immune responses. Differences exist between local immunosuppression, in which the antigen is applied directly to the irradiated body site, and systemic immunosuppression, in which the antigen is applied to a site distant from the irradiated area. The main outcome of local immunosuppression is the promotion of antigen-specific regulatory T and B cells in local lymph nodes that suppress immunity.<span id="bbib95"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib95" id="ancbbib95"><sup>95</sup></a></span> In systemic immunosuppression, mediators such as prostaglandins might be released from the irradiated site and a systemic increase in regulatory T cells and activation of natural killer T cells that promote tolerance could occur.<span id="bbib96"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib96" id="ancbbib96"><sup>96</sup></a></span></p>

Irradiation of human skin with ultraviolet light produces antimicrobial peptides, possibly through vitamin D, including β-defensin 2 and β-defensin 3.<span id="bbib97"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib97" id="ancbbib97"><sup>97</sup></a></span> Thus, although exposure to ultraviolet light suppresses adaptive immunity, it can also foster innate mechanisms that could be important in controlling bacterial infections, especially on epidermal surfaces. In human skin cells in vitro and mouse skin in vivo, the topical application of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D after exposure to ultraviolet radiation can reduce DNA damage and apoptosis of skin cells via the rapid non-genomic pathway.<span id="bbib98"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib98" id="ancbbib98"><sup>98</sup></a></span> Additionally, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D reduces ultraviolet-induced suppression in contact hypersensitivity in mice;<span id="bbib99"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib99" id="ancbbib99"><sup>99</sup></a></span> thus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is protective against several of the immunosuppressive effects of ultraviolet radiation.</p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para520">

Different approaches point to an effect of exposure to ultraviolet radiation in tuberculosis transmission. First, tuberculosis has an annual seasonal pattern in many countries. Fares<span id="bbib100"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib100" id="ancbbib100"><sup>100</sup></a></span> reviewed 12 studies involving data from 11 countries or regions and recorded a peak of cases (defined as time of notification, frequently about 3 months after onset of symptoms) in spring and summer. Similar findings of a spring peak have been reported from Cape Town<span id="bbib101"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib101" id="ancbbib101"><sup>101</sup></a></span> and New York.<span id="bbib102"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib102" id="ancbbib102"><sup>102</sup></a></span> This pattern could be attributed to high <em>M tuberculosis</em> transmission risk during winter months and low vitamin D status at this time of the year leading to impaired innate immune responses and perhaps reactivation of latent infection. Additionally, cough during winter could erroneously be attributed to non-tuberculous causes, with tuberculosis diagnoses being delayed until spring.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib102"><sup>102</sup></a></span> Alternatively, infection in winter could be controlled, allowing the ultraviolet-induced immunosuppression after high exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation in spring to be sufficient to enable active disease.</p>

Second, ultraviolet irradiation can reduce the immune response to <em>M tuberculosis</em> in a guineapig model.<span id="bbib103"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib103" id="ancbbib103"><sup>103</sup></a></span> Animals vaccinated with BCG, then irradiated with ultraviolet light, showed suppression of the delayed hypersensitivity response to purified protein derivative.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib103"><sup>103</sup></a></span> On challenge with an aerosol of live <em>M tuberculosis</em>, the pulmonary microbial load was increased, and in-vitro lymphoproliferative response to purified protein derivative reduced, in irradiated compared with non-irradiated animals.

The moderating role of skin pigmentation in ultraviolet-induced vitamin D production could also be relevant. Finally, ultraviolet irradiation reduces memory responses to BCG in humans.<span id="bbib106"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib106" id="ancbbib106"><sup>106</sup></a></span> Individuals immunised with BCG were exposed to suberythemal solar simulated ultraviolet radiation before challenge with purified protein derivative on the irradiated and a distant non-irradiated site—the Mantoux reaction was suppressed at the irradiated site but not at the distant site.</p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para540">

Effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D are difficult to examine separately in studies of human beings.

Both experimental studies on animals and epidemiological studies in human beings suggest independent effects for ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, but we are unaware of any research specifically assessing antimycobacterial responses.</p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para550">

Studies reviewed here suggest that ultraviolet radiation could have a predominantly immunosuppressive role in tuberculosis through the downregulation of acquired immunity, while potentially promoting the production of vitamin D.</p>

In the 19th century, cod-liver oil was used in Europe to prevent childhood diseases such as rickets and tuberculosis.<sup><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib33">33</a> and <a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib108" id="bbib108">108</a></sup> Although not a cure, a benefit in patients with tuberculosis was weight gain.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib108" id="ancbbib108"><sup>108</sup></a></span> It was sometimes given in large doses (0·5–1·0 pint every 4–8 days or one or two tablespoons two to four times daily). The chemical structures of the vitamins D were discovered by Windaus and colleagues<span id="bbib109"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib109" id="ancbbib109"><sup>109</sup></a></span> in the 1930s and the antirachitic component of cod-liver oil, identified in rats, was identical to vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. One tablespoon of cod-liver oil contains about 1360 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, the highest level in any food, in addition to vitamin A and omega-3 fatty acids.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib108"><sup>108</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para570">

The use of cod-liver oil in the treatment of tuberculosis fell during the early 20th century because of its unpleasant taste and the increased popularity of heliotherapy (sun exposure) and phototherapy (exposure to an artificial light source). In the 1940s, however, several physicians treated lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis) with large doses of vitamin D<sub>2</sub>: 150 000 IU/day orally.<span id="bbib110"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib110" id="ancbbib110"><sup>110</sup></a></span> In one report, 56% of patients were cured and 20% were unresponsive after treatment, with hypercalcaemia as a recognised complication.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib110"><sup>110</sup></a></span> The toxicity threshold for vitamin D is now estimated at 10 000–50 000 IU/day.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib54"><sup>54</sup></a></span> In Jan 2012, hypercalcaemia was also noted in a case report after high-dose vitamin D supplementation in patients with tuberculosis.<span id="bbib111"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib111" id="ancbbib111"><sup>111</sup></a></span> Vitamin D was also used in the treatment of disseminated tuberculosis: a 1948 case report described success after oral administration of 100 000 IU cholecalciferol daily.<span id="bbib112"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib112" id="ancbbib112"><sup>112</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, vitamin D was replaced by antibiotics from the second half of the 20th century, until its return recently.</p>

Heliotherapy was introduced in the mid-1800s with the opening of a thermal treatment station in Slovenia.<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib32" id="ancbbib32"><sup>32</sup></a></span> A great advance was made by Finsen<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib32"><sup>32</sup></a></span> who used filtered sunlight in 1893 to treat cutaneous tuberculosis, and in 1901, created a carbon arc lamp that emitted concentrated ultraviolet radiation–the first source of phototherapy. Antimicrobial peptides induced in keratinocytes by exposure to ultraviolet light, via a vitamin D-related mechanism, have been postulated to provide an explanation for this result. However, the spectrum of the lamp was recorded recently and contained no UVB, hence vitamin D production in patients irradiated using this technique is unlikely; an alternative suggestion is that the longer UVA rays might kill <em>M tuberculosis</em> by a photodynamic mechanism because the bacteria contains coproporphyrin III.<span id="bbib113"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib113" id="ancbbib113"><sup>113</sup></a></span> Additionally, germicidal ultraviolet lamps, which emit short-wavelength UVC radiation and exert a direct bactericidal effect, have a proven effectiveness against airborne <em>M tuberculosis</em>.<span id="bbib114"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib114" id="ancbbib114"><sup>114</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para590">

Interest in natural exposure to sunlight as a tuberculosis treatment continued to develop. A 1903 study<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib32"><sup>32</sup></a></span> of graded sun exposures showed that time-to-cure was shorter than when carbon arc lamps were used. From the 1920s until the antibiotic era, heliotherapy became the most popular method of tuberculosis treatment in Europe and the USA, although it was contraindicated for pulmonary tuberculosis in some studies.<span id="bbib115"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib115" id="ancbbib115"><sup>115</sup></a></span> Notably, long-term rest and a nourishing diet were deemed to be as essential as sun exposure.</p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para600">

Exposure to the sun and dietary vitamin D were thus thought to help in the treatment of specific forms of tuberculosis, although other components of these strategies might have contributed to any true therapeutic effects. There were also substantial changes in social environments in high-income countries, which reduced the risks of <em>M tuberculosis</em> transmission.</p>

Observational studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration</h3>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para610">

In-vivo studies in human beings have been unable to clearly address whether vitamin D status affects susceptibility to tuberculosis infection, development of active disease from latency, or treatment response. This is because most studies of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in patients with active tuberculosis are cross-sectional, and are therefore unable to show whether low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are a result of, rather than a risk factor for, the disease process (<span id="btbl2"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#tbl2" id="ancbtbl2">table 2</a></span>). Moreover, diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis infection (ie, Mantoux test and in-vitro interferon gamma production) assess T-cell responses to mycobacterial antigens, responses that themselves might be affected by vitamin D status.</p>

Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation</h2>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para650">

Although observational studies justify trials of vitamin D supplementation to inhibit progression from latent to active tuberculosis, such studies pose difficulties because they need large numbers of patients, long follow-up, and would need to show a clear additional benefit over evidence-based treatments for latent infection (eg, isoniazid preventive treatment and antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV). Of note, vitamin D supplementation does not decrease the risk of tuberculosis in patients with renal dialysis.<span id="bbib139"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib139" id="ancbbib139"><sup>139</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para660">

By contrast with the absence of prevention trials to date, administration of vitamin D in active disease has been reported over many decades. A review in 2006 of three trials and ten case series of treatment of patients with tuberculosis with vitamin D<span id="bbib140"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib140" id="ancbbib140"><sup>140</sup></a></span> concluded that benefits were uncertain because the studies were of poor quality, often used vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, and did not examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on outcomes. Subsequent trials show predominantly negative results (<span id="btbl3"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#tbl3" id="ancbtbl3">table 3</a></span>). Such findings also characterise trials of vitamin D supplementation for other diseases. For example, despite a clear role for this vitamin in bone health, and vitamin D being commonly recommended for fracture prevention, most studies have failed to show an independent benefit of vitamin D in hip fracture prevention.<span id="bbib143"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib143" id="ancbbib143"><sup>143</sup></a></span> Reasons that trials may fail to support findings from observational studies could include uncontrolled confounding; that vitamin D is indeed beneficial, but trials had inadequate power or used sub-optimal doses; that the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration examined in observational studies is a proxy for sun exposure and physical activity; or that host determinants, such as expression of 1α-hydroxylase and vitamin D binding protein, affect results. Furthermore, increases in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D through vitamin D supplementation might not result in increased 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D to the neccessary concentrations or in the appropriate cellular compartments. Lappe and Heaney<span id="bbib144"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib144" id="ancbbib144"><sup>144</sup></a></span> describe potential reasons for false-negative findings from vitamin D trials, including that the dose–response curve for vitamin D is sigmoid, so only a few patients towards the centre of the curve will experience substantial effects from a given supplementary dose. Recent results suggest more promising effects of vitamin D supplementation in tuberculosis than had previously been shown (<span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#tbl3">table 3</a></span>).<span id="bbib142"><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#bib142" id="ancbbib142"><sup>142</sup></a></span></p>

Conclusions</h2>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para670">

The interpretation of studies on vitamin D needs an appreciation of assay variability and the controversies surrounding appropriate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D reference ranges. Vitamin D has both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects, and ultraviolet radiation, an important confounder, has mainly immunosuppressive effects. Whereas historical literature on phototherapy supports the use of vitamin D in patients with tuberculosis, direct mycobactericidal actions of exposure to ultraviolet light could have contributed to such findings, if indeed real benefits occurred. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations could reflect an appropriate immune response of activated macrophages to <em>M tuberculosis</em>, because this molecule is consumed in the production of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, a mediator of important antimycobacterial effects. Because low baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in tuberculosis increases spontaneously over time, there is clearly a need for improved understanding of vitamin D metabolism in acute disease, especially disease characterised by macrophage activation, and in which protein synthesis, including vitamin D binding protein, could be impaired. The main trials of vitamin D in people with active tuberculosis to date have not been able to show major benefits overall.</p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para680">

The classification of the relation between vitamin D and tuberculosis risk through prospective surveillance of populations with latent infection or a clinical trial of supplementary vitamin D in this group, would need ambitious sample sizes. People at increased risk of developing active tuberculosis, such as HIV-positive individuals recently infected with tuberculosis, already need isoniazid preventive therapy with or without antiretrovirals; thus, benefits of vitamin D would need to be shown in addition to these optimised background treatment strategies. If HIV-negative individuals were selected, the sample size needed to detect a decrease in active tuberculosis rates from 5% to 3% during 2 years of follow-up, in people given placebo versus vitamin D, would be more than 4000. While such studies are not implausible, in the meanwhile, important scope exists for further investigation in patients with active tuberculosis to shed light on the vitamin D-tuberculosis association.</p>

<p class="svArticle section" id="para690">

Research to address the hypotheses outlined in <span><a class="intra_ref" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330991270275X#box2">panel 2</a></span> and to improve our understanding of vitamin D metabolism in active tuberculosis could include investigation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in relation to measured ultraviolet radiation exposure, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D binding protein, and VDR polymorphisms, at tuberculosis diagnosis and during recovery. Further supplementary trials in patients with active tuberculosis, which could incorporate these assessments, would best be done in vitamin D-deficient populations or subgroups selected on the basis of VDR polymorphisms, using adequate vitamin D doses that remain to be identified. Accessible, safe, and inexpensive measures to reduce the population burden of tuberculosis would be welcomed. Any major therapeutic role for vitamin D in tuberculosis remains an unproven but tantalising concept.</p>
