Background

Narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy (nbUVB) is an established treatment modality for patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and is known to increase serum vitamin D levels (SVD). The relationship between SVD and AD remains unclear.

Objectives

To assess SVD and disease severity in patients with AD before and after nbUVB and establish whether a change in SVD correlates to response to nbUVB.

Methods

A single-centre, open observational study recruited 21 male and 17 female patients with AD between November and April. Eczema severity was measured using the SCORAD tool and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were determined pre- and post- nbUVB which was administered thrice weekly.

Results

9 patients had severe AD, 23 moderate and 6 mild indicated by SCORAD measurements. 17 patients completed the study. Median SVD increased from 45nmol/L pre-treatment to 169nmol/L post treatment (95% CI, 2.9 - 5.0 times baseline) (p<0.0001). Mean SCORAD reduction following nbUVB was significant at 21.9 units (95% CI, 14.9 - 28.9) (p<0.0001). No evidence of a relationship between change in SCORAD and change in SVD was found.

Limitations

The number of patients failing to complete study.

Conclusions

Patients with AD are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Correlation between this and disease severity has been postulated but this study does not provide confirmatory evidence.

### Summary by VitaminDWiki

Levels raised from  18 ng to 68 ng

Study duration = 6 months.

No indication of how long the people had useful vitamin D levels (> 40 ng)

only 45% of the people completed the study - no indication if the dropouts were or were not cured
