Introduction: Cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities have been recog­nized as predictors of clinical response in patients receiving cardiac resynchroniza­tion therapy (CRT). However, data on vitamin D as a predictor of CRT response are conflicting.

Method: We identified studies from MEDLINE and Embase databases, searching from inception to May 2024, to investigate the association between 25-OH vitamin D lev­els before CRT implantation and outcomes. Studies had to report 25-OH vitamin D levels or the proportion of patients with vitamin D insufficiency and categorize out­comes as CRT responders or nonresponders. We extracted mean 25-OH vitamin D and standard deviations for both groups from each study and calculated the pooled mean difference (MD). We also retrieved risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between vitamin D insufficiency and lack of CRT response, combining them using the generic inverse variance method.

Results: Our meta-analysis included four studies. CRT responders had higher levels of 25-OH vitamin D than nonresponders, with a pooled MD of 8.04ng/mL (95% CI: 3.16-12.93; i2=48%, p<.001). Patients with vitamin D insufficiency before implanta­tion had higher odds of lacking response to CRT, with a pooled  **RR of 3.28**  (95% CI: 1.43-7.50; I2 = 0%, p = .005) compared to those with normal vitamin D.

Conclusions: CRT responders had higher 25-OH vitamin D levels compared to non­responders. Vitamin D insufficiency was associated with a higher risk of nonresponse to CRT. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring and managing vitamin D levels in these patients.

#### What is cardiac resynchronization therapy - Perplexity AI July 2024

 **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)** 

Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), also known as biventricular pacing, is a medical treatment designed to improve the heart's rhythm and function in patients with heart failure and arrhythmias. This therapy involves the implantation of a specialized pacemaker that helps the heart's ventricles (the lower chambers) beat in a more synchronized manner.

 **How CRT Works** 

CRT involves the use of a device called a biventricular pacemaker. This device is implanted under the skin, typically just below the collarbone, and is connected to the heart via three leads (wires). These leads are strategically placed in the right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle (via the coronary sinus) to monitor and regulate the heart's electrical activity. The pacemaker sends small electrical impulses to both ventricles to ensure they contract simultaneously, thereby improving the heart's efficiency in pumping blood.

 **Types of CRT Devices** 

There are two main types of CRT devices:

*  **CRT-P (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemaker)** : This device functions like a standard pacemaker but also delivers electrical impulses to synchronize the ventricles.

*  **CRT-D (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator)** : This device combines the functions of a CRT-P with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). It not only synchronizes the ventricles but also can deliver shocks to correct life-threatening arrhythmias.

 **Benefits of CRT** 

CRT can offer several benefits for patients with heart failure, including:

* Improved heart function and efficiency

* Reduced symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fatigue

* Enhanced quality of life

* Decreased risk of hospitalization and mortality

* Improved exercise capacity.

 **Candidates for CRT** 

CRT is typically recommended for patients who:

* Have moderate to severe heart failure symptoms

* Have an enlarged and weakened heart

* Exhibit dyssynchrony in the heart's ventricles, often indicated by a condition like left bundle branch block

* Have not responded adequately to medication and lifestyle changes.

 **Risks and Considerations** 

While CRT is generally considered safe, it does carry some risks, including:

* Infection at the implantation site

* Bleeding or bruising

* Lead displacement or malfunction

* Pneumothorax (collapsed lung)

* Reactions to anesthesia.

 **Procedure** 

The implantation of a CRT device involves a minor surgical procedure, usually performed under local anesthesia with sedation. The leads are inserted into the heart through a vein and connected to the pacemaker, which is placed under the skin. The procedure typically requires an overnight hospital stay, and patients can usually resume normal activities within a few days, with some restrictions on heavy lifting and driving.

 **Follow-Up** 

After the procedure, regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the device's function and battery life. Adjustments to the device's settings may be made to optimize its performance and ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient.In summary, CRT is a valuable therapy for certain patients with heart failure, helping to improve heart function and quality of life by synchronizing the contractions of the heart's ventricles. It is a well-established treatment option with significant benefits, though it is not suitable for everyone and carries some risks.
