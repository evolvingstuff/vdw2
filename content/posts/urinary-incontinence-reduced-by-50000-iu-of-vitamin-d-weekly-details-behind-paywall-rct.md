Introduction and hypothesis

Conflicting results have been reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on urinary incontinence (UI). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of consuming vitamin D oral supplements on improving urge UI (UUI) in postmenopausal women with vitamin D deficiency.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2019–2020 in postmenopausal women with UUI or nocturia more than once at night with vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/ml. After recording the severity of UI and its impact on the patient's daily life, patients were randomly divided into two groups of 45 patients: one taking vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) tablets and one taking placebo weekly for 8 weeks.

Results

There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the severity of UI and the frequency of nocturia before treatment. However, after treatment, in the vitamin D group, the severity of UI and the frequency of nocturia significantly reduced. Before treatment, the impact of UI on patients' daily life was reported to be high in more than 70% of patients in both groups, which was not significantly different; however, after treatment, its impact was significantly reduced in the vitamin D group.

Conclusions

The findings of the present study showed that in postmenopausal women with UUI or nocturia, weekly use of vitamin D 50,000 IU tablets for 8 weeks can reduce the severity of UI and the frequency of nocturia, and reduce their impact on disruption in daily life.
