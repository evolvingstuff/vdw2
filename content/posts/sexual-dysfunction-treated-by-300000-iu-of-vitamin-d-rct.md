PURPOSE:

To investigate the effect of vitamin D therapy on sexual function in women with low vitamin D levels and sexual dysfunction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on women aged 18-45 years with sexual dysfunction (Female Sexual Functioning Index score of <26.55) and a serum 25<span>[OH]</span>D level of <30 ng/mL. Participants received an intramuscular injection of 300,000 IU cholecalciferol or a placebo at baseline and then after four weeks. Sexual function was evaluated using the Female Sexual Function Index at baseline, and then after four and eight weeks. The serum level of 25<span>[OH]</span>D and depression symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) were evaluated at baseline and then after eight weeks.

RESULTS:

Thirty-eight women in each group completed the study. The serum levels of 25<span>[OH]</span>D increased only in the cholecalciferol group by 14.4 ± 3.2 ng/mL (P<0.001). 

The Female Sexual Function Index score was higher in the intervention group at the 

* 4th (19.6 vs. 16.3, P=0.002) and 

* 8th (25.0 vs. 17.1, P <0.001) 

weeks of the study. 

The Beck Depression Inventory score was significantly decreased only in the cholecalciferol group by -21.0 ± 12.3 (P<0.001). The effect of treatment on sexual function was independent from its effect on symptoms of depression.

CONCLUSION:

Vitamin D therapy in women with sexual dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency can improve their sexual function. This effect does not seem to be mediated by the improvement of depression symptoms.
