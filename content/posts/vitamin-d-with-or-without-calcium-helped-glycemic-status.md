BACKGROUND: Low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> have been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effects of daily intake of vitamin D- or vitamin D(3) + calcium-fortified yogurt drink on glycemic status in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

DESIGN: Ninety diabetic subjects were randomly allocated to 3 groups to consume plain yogurt drink (PY; containing no vitamin D and 150 mg Ca/250 mL), vitamin D-fortified yogurt drink (DY; containing  **500 IU vitamin D(3)**  and 150 mg Ca/250 mL), or vitamin D + calcium-fortified yogurt drink (DCY; containing 500 IU vitamin D(3) and 250 mg Ca/250 mL) twice per day for 12 wk. Fasting serum glucose (FSG), glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum lipid profile, and percentage fat mass (FM) were assessed before (baseline) and after the intervention.

RESULTS: In both the DY and DCY groups, mean serum 25(OH)D(3) improved (+32.8 ± 28.4 and +28.8 ± 16.1 nmol/L, respectively; P < 0.001 for both), but FSG [-12.9 ± 33.7 mg/dL (P = 0.015) and -9.6 ± 46.9 mg/dL (P = 0.035), respectively](-12.9%20±%2033.7%20mg/dL%20(P%20=%200.015)%20and%20-9.6%20±%2046.9%20mg/dL%20(P%20=%200.035),%20respectively), Hb A(1c) <span>[-0.4 ± 1.2% (P < 0.001) and -0.4 ± 1.9% (P < 0.001), respectively]</span>, HOMA-IR <span>[-0.6 ± 1.4 (P = 0.001) and -0.6 ± 3.2 (P < 0.001), respectively]</span>, waist circumference (-3.6 ± 2.7 and -2.9 ± 3.3, respectively; P < 0.001 for both), and body mass index [in kg/m(2); -0.9 ± 0.6 (P < 0.001) and -0.4 ± 0.7 (P = 0.005), respectively](in%20kg/m(2);%20-0.9%20±%200.6%20(P%20<%200.001)%20and%20-0.4%20±%200.7%20(P%20=%200.005),%20respectively) decreased significantly more than in the PY group. An inverse correlation was observed between changes in serum 25(OH)D(3) and FSG (r = -0.208, P = 0.049), FM (r = -0.219, P = 0.038), and HOMA-IR (r = -0.219, P = 0.005).

CONCLUSION: Daily intake of a vitamin D-fortified yogurt drink, either with or without added calcium, improved glycemic status in T2D patients. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01229891.
