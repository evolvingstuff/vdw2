Abstract: Vitamin D has an important role in early life; however, the optimal vitamin D status during pregnancy is currently unclear. There have been recent calls for pregnant women to maintain circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations >100 nmol/L for health, yet little is known about the long-term potential benefits or safety of achieving such high maternal 25(OH)D concentrations for infant or child health outcomes. We examined maternal vitamin D status and its associations with infant anthropometric and later childhood neurocognitive outcomes in a mother-child cohort in a sun-rich country near the equator (4.6° S). This study was conducted in pregnant mothers originally recruited to the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study. Blood samples (n = 202) taken at delivery were analysed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. Multiple linear regression models assessed associations between maternal 25(OH)D and birth weight, infant head circumference, and neurocognitive outcomes in the children at age 5 years. Mothers were, on average, 27 years of age, and the children's average gestational age was 39 weeks. None of the women reported any intake of vitamin D supplements. Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations had a mean of 101 (range 34-218 nmol/L) and none were deficient (<30 nmol/L). Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with child anthropometric or neurodevelopmental outcomes. These findings appear to indicate that a higher vitamin D status is not a limiting factor for neonatal growth or neurocognitive development in the first 5 years of life. Larger studies with greater variability in vitamin D status are needed to further explore optimal cut-offs or non-linear associations (including for maternal health) that might exist among populations with sub-optimal exposure.

#### Conclusions

In conclusion, we observed nearly universal vitamin D sufficiency among a cohort of mothers living near the equator, reflecting the 25(OH)D concentrations which are achievable during pregnancy without seasonality. At relatively high, un-supplemented 25(OH)D concentrations, we did not observe any associations with birth outcomes or neurodevelopmental tests administered to the offspring at age 5 years. These findings appear to indicate that having a high vitamin D status is not a limiting factor for neonatal growth or neurocognitive development in the first 5 years of life. This lack of any observations of adverse effects on infant or child growth could be advantageous for pregnant women who maintain higher 25(OH)D concentrations for maternal health. However, further research is needed to identify either any currently undetected adverse health effects of attaining such high 25(OH)D maternal concentrations and also the potential wider health benefits for both maternal and child health.
