Researches indicate that individuals with recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may exhibit vitamin D insufficiency, and certain studies suggest that correcting severe vitamin D deficiency might effectively reduce BPPV recurrence; nevertheless, the findings have been inconsistent. As a result, we conducted the current Meta-analysis to investigate potential associations of vitamin D levels with the occurrence and recurrence of BPPV. In the meantime, the current study was done to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence.</p><p>Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library) were identified to search for relevant studies about (vitamin D or vitamin D supplementation) and (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo incidence or recurrence) from inception to Dec 22, 2024. 60 studies with a total of 16,368 participants were included into this meta-analysis.</p><p>Results:</p><ul><li><p>(1) The aggregated weighted mean difference (WMD) demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in vitamin D level in the BPPV cohort (WMD = -2.84; 95% CI -4.53 to -1.15) relative to the control cohort. Likewise, Recurrent BPPV groups had significantly lower levels of vitamin D compared to non-recurrent groups (WMD = -5.01; 95% CI -6.94 to -3.08). When the cupulolithiasis BPPV groups were compared to the canalolithiasis BPPV groups, the vitamin D level was lower in the cupulolithiasis groups (WMD = 5.09; 95% CI 2.05 to 8.12);</p></li><li><p>(2) In this meta-analysis, the multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) indicated that increased vitamin D was inversely related to BPPV incidence (RR = 1.36; 95% CI 1.31, 1.41), but not significantly related to the recurrence (RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99);</p></li><li><p>(3) Vitamin D supplementation group had a lower recurrence rate than the control group which did not accepted vitamin D supplementation (RR =0.45, 95% CI = 0.36-0.55).</p></li></ul><p>Conclusion: The serum level of vitamin D is lower in patients with BPPV, especially recurrent BPPV, than in controls. There was a negative correlation between occurrence rate of BPPV episodes and vitamin D deficiency, which means that vitamin D deficiency may have a role in occurrence of BPPV. The present study indicates that vitamin D supplementation can significantly lower recurrence in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The level of vitamin D was lower in canalolithiasis than in cupulolithiasis BPPV groups.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/bppv-recurrence.webp>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=87-reduction-in-recurrence-of-bppv-with-13-weeks-of-vitamin-d-2000-iu-daily---rct-aug-2024>87% reduction in recurrence of BPPV with 13 weeks of Vitamin D (2,000 IU daily) - RCT Aug 2024</h4><p>Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2024 Aug 28. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.954>doi: 10.1002/ohn.954</a></p><p><strong>Randomized Controlled Trial Assessing Vitamin D&rsquo;s Role in Reducing BPPV Recurrence in Older Adults</strong></p><p>Kenneth W De Chua 1, Xiaoting Huang 2, Xuan H Koh 3, Joshua F J Y Soh 4, Vivian C Barrera 5, Poongkulali Anaikatti 6, Deng Jing 1, Shirlene Moh 7, Miko Yeo 7, Heng W Yuen 1, David Low 1, Barbara H Rosario 5</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/bppv-recurrent.webp alt=image width=600><p>Objective: To determine if the recurrence rates of BPPV in older adults were lower in the vitamin D-treated group as compared to placebo groups.</p><p>Study design: Double-blinded randomized control placebo trial.</p><p>Setting: A single-centre study.</p><p>Methods: Double-blinded randomized controlled trial design with 12 months follow-up. Vitamin D3 deplete participants were randomized into treatment ( Group A ) or placebo groups ( Group B ).

Emerging research suggests a link between Vitamin D deficiency and BPPV, attributed to Vitamin D’s role in calcium metabolism essential for inner ear function. This study investigates the relationship between Vitamin D levels and the incidence, severity, and recurrence of BPPV. This year-long prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center, enrolling 100 patients diagnosed with BPPV. Vitamin D levels were measured and classified as deficient, insufficient, or sufficient. Patients identified with Vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 20 ng/mL) received supplementation at a dose of 2000 IU daily for six months. Participants were followed monthly for one year to monitor the incidence and severity of BPPV episodes, assessed using the Vertigo Symptom Scale, and recurrence rates. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the Vitamin D-BPPV relationship.</p><p>The study revealed that patients with Vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 20 ng/mL) had a 71% incidence of BPPV, compared to 20% in those with sufficient levels. The average severity score was higher in the deficient group (7.5) versus the sufficient group (3.5). Vitamin D supplementation correlated with reduced BPPV incidence and severity over time. The findings indicate a significant link between Vitamin D deficiency and increased BPPV incidence and severity, highlighting Vitamin D’s role in vestibular health. These results suggest that Vitamin D supplementation could be integral to BPPV management. Further research, including controlled studies, is needed to understand the mechanisms behind these associations and their clinical implications.</p><hr><h4 id=bppv-recurrences-decreased-with-vitamin-d-supplements--4-out-of-5-studies--feb-2024>BPPV recurrences decreased with Vitamin D supplements (4 out of 5 studies) – Feb 2024</h4><p><strong>Vitamin D Supplementation and Recurrence of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo</strong></p><p>Nutrients. 2024 Feb 28;16(5):689. <a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16050689.>doi: 10.3390/nu16050689.</a></p><p>Guil Rhim 1, Moon-Jung Kim 2</p><p>Positional vertigo manifests as a spinning sensation triggered by changes in head position relative to gravity. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an inner ear disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of positional vertigo. The connection between vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency and the onset and recurrence of BPPV is established. This study aims to assess vitamin D as a recurring factor in BPPV and the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in preventing its recurrence. A comprehensive literature review on the relationship between vitamin D and BPPV recurrence was conducted, searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and article reference lists for studies published from 2020 to 2023. A total of 79 articles were initially identified through the search, with 12 of them being utilized in the study.

Various theories have been suggested to explain the cause of RD, and otolith organ disorder is the most evident cause of RD. This study aimed to investigate the association between serum levels of Vit D and the occurrence of RD after the successful treatment of BPPV.</p><p>Methods: A prospective study including patients who were diagnosed with de novo posterior semicircular canal-type BPPV (PC-BPPV) was conducted at our institution from May 2017 to May 2019. All the patients underwent canalith repositioning procedures and were followed up. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and RD occurrence after successful BPPV treatment.</p><p>Results: In total, 123 patients with PC-BPPV were enrolled, and <strong>41.5% (51/123) experienced RD</strong> . The serum level of 25(OH)D was significantly lower in PC-BPPV patients with RD <a href=median%2016.2%20ng/ml%20(IQR%2012.9-22.1)>median 16.2 ng/ml (IQR 12.9-22.1)</a> than in patients without RD <a href=median%2020.5%20ng/ml%20(IQR%2016.5-26.5)>median 20.5 ng/ml (IQR 16.5-26.5)</a> (P = 0.001).

Vitamin D deficiency may be one of the causes of its development. To assess the relation between recurrent attacks BPPV and Vitamin D deficiency. A case control study in which 40 patients were clinically diagnosed as posterior canal BPPV, Serum 25(OH) D was measured at 1st visit. Patients were divided into two groups; group A (20 patients) received Vitamin D supplementation in addition to canal repositioning maneuver and group B (20 patients) treated by canal repositioning maneuver only. Follow up of all patients for 6 months, neuro-otological assessment was repeated and recurrent attacks were recorded. Serum vitamin D was repeated after 6 month. This study included 14 males and 26 females age ranged from 35 to 61 years, Average serum of 25 (OH) D at the first visit was (12.4 ± 2 ng/ml) for group A, and (12.2 ± 1.7 ng/ml) for group B, all patients had low serum level of 25(OH) D (below 20 ng/ml). Recurrent BPPV episodes, were significantly lower in group A than that of group B.

It is thought to be an otoconia-related balance disorder. Our objectives were to assess the serum concentrations of vitamin D and calcium (total and ionized) in cases with BPPV, determine if low vitamin D levels were regarded as a cause for BPPV relapse, and determine whether vitamin D supplementation would minimize the risk of BPPV relapse.</p><p>Results: Sixty cases with BPPV were included in the study; 53 cases had posterior canal BPPV, while seven had lateral canal BPPV. Canalithiasis was the most common type of BPPV pathology. Forty cases had abnormally low levels of vitamin D. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the mean vitamin D assay for all cases with BPPV and serum calcium.

Although the treatment of BPPV is relatively successful, many patients suffer recurrence after treatment. Therefore, identifying potential risk factors for BPPV recurrence may help improve treatment outcome and patient prognosis. However, some related risk factors for BPPV recurrence are relatively controversial and poorly studied. This meta-analysis aims to identify potential risk factors associated with BPPV recurrence, thereby reducing the recurrence rate of BPPV and improving the prognosis of patients.</p><p>Methods: This meta-analysis was conducted through systematically searching PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible English original studies published up to June 2020. All search results were reviewed based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) or the mean differences (MDs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effects of included risk factors on BPPV recurrence.</p><p>Results: A total of 14 studies involving 3060 BPPV patients published between 2010 and 2019 were finally included, including six prospective studies and eight retrospective studies, with a NOS score ranged from 6 to 9. Our pooled results of this meta-analysis suggested that the recurrence of BPPV was closely related to</p><ul><li><p>female gender (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.17-1.74; P = 0.0004),</p></li><li><p>hypertension (OR = 2.61; 95% CI 1.22-5.59; P = 0.01),</p></li><li><p>diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.62; 95% CI 1.25-5.48; P = 0.01),</p></li><li><p>hyperlipidemia (OR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.23-2.09; P = 0.0006),</p></li><li><p>osteoporosis (OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.03-2.88; P = 0.04) and</p></li><li><p>vitamin D deficiency (MD = - 3.29; 95% CI - 5.32 to - 1.26; P = 0.001).</p></li></ul><p>Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicated that female gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency were risk factors for BPPV recurrence. However, the effects of other potential risk factors including advanced age, migraine, head trauma, and Menière&rsquo;s disease on BPPV recurrence need further investigations. Furthermore, most studies included in this meta-analysis were performed in Asia, so our results cannot easily be extended to the whole world population. Therefore, more large-scale prospective studies in different countries are required to further investigate these risk factors.</p><hr><h4 id=bppv-risk-reduced-3x-with-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-aug--2020>BPPV risk reduced 3X with Vitamin D - meta-analysis Aug 2020</h4><p><strong>Prevention of recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with vitamin D supplementation: a meta-analysis</strong></p><p>Journal of Neurology Volume 269, pages 619–626, (2022) <a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09952-8>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09952-8</a> PDF behing paywall</p><p>Seong-Hae Jeong, Sun-Uk Lee & Ji-Soo Kim</p><img src=https://d378j1rmrlek7x.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/vertigo-risk-ratio.webp alt=image width=600><p>Research Background</p><p>Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is known to be related to occurrences and recurrences of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing recurrences of BPPV remains to be established. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, for preventing recurrences of BPPV.</p><p>Methods</p><p>We searched the PubMed, the Embase, the Web of Science and the reference lists of the articles. We included randomized or non-randomized trials that determined the efficacy of supplementing vitamin D or related compounds, alone or with calcium, in comparison to placebo or no intervention in preventing recurrences of BPPV. The primary outcome was the number of patients with BPPV recurrences. Data were collected and pooled using a weighted relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95% CIs, where possible, by adopting the fixed-effect or random-effect model according to the heterogeneity among the studies. The between-study heterogeneity was tested using the χ2 test and the I2 statistic, and funnel plots were used to evaluate any publication bias.</p><p>Results</p><p>We included five trials (four non-randomized trials and one randomized controlled trial) with a total of 1250 participants. The analyses showed a significant preventive effect on the recurrences of BPPV (RR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.18–0.76; p = 0.007 with the random-effects model) with supplementation of vitamin D. Although a considerable heterogeneity was detected among the studies, the sensitivity analyses showed the reliability and stability of our results.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Vitamin D supplementation provides a benefit for secondary prevention of BPPV. Supplementation of vitamin D should be considered in patients with frequent attacks of BPPV, especially when serum vitamin D is subnormal.</p><hr><h4 id=bppv-2x-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d---meta-analysis-of-18-studies-jan2020>BPPV 2X more likely if low Vitamin D - meta-analysis of 18 studies Jan 2020</h4><p><strong>Association Between Serum Vitamin D Levels and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies</strong></p><p>Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol, 277 (1), 169-177 Jan 2020, PMID: 31630244 DOI: 10.1007/s00405-019-05694-0</p><p>Baiyuan Yang 1, Yongxia Lu 2, Dongmei Xing 3, Wei Zhong 1, Qing Tang 1, Jingyu Liu 2, Xinglong Yang 4</p><p>Objective: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) was the most common neuro-otological disorder manifests as recurrent positional vertigo, but its risk factors are elusive.

The etiopathology of recurrent BPPV is possibly related to low serum vitamin D levels. Finding a therapeutic weapon will help with these complicated cases, reducing disability, falling risk and also health care costs.</p><p>Study design: Clinical trial: one-year duration.</p><p>Setting: Ten patients with diagnosis of BPPV made by history and physical examination and at least two episodes of documented BPPV in the previous two years and chronic complaints of dizziness. Neurologic and other otological diseases were excluded for these patients.</p><p>Subjects and methods: Vitamin D was evaluated by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD). Levels below 20 ng/mL were considered deficiency and levels between 20 and 30 ng/mL were considered insufficiency. Half of the patients (treatment group) started a treatment with cholecalciferol while the remaining patients were the control group. All of the patients were reevaluated every three months.</p><p>Results: All patients of the treatment group did not have any subsequent episode of positional vertigo, dizziness complaints or nystagmus evoked by provocative manoeuvers. At reevaluations, the mean value of serum 25-OHD for the treatment group had increased noticeably.

The present case- control study was conducted to assess the influence of serum vitamin D normalization on recurrent attacks of vitamin D deficient patients.<p>METHODS: Diagnosis of BPPV was made based on history and clinical examination and exclusion of other conditions. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) was measured using ELISA method and a levels of &lt; 20 ng/ml was considered a deficiency of vitamin D. Inclusion criteria were as follows: history of recurrent attacks and serum 25-OHD&lt;20.ng/ml. While the patients with history of trauma, surgery and chronic systemic diseases were excluded. The patients were classified into two groups: treatment and control, intermittently. Both groups received Epley rehabilitation therapy one session per week for 4 weeks but the treatment group received an additional supplement of 50.000 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) weekly for two months to achieve serum 25-OHD ≥ 30 ng/ml and the study patients were followed-up for 6 months.</p><p>RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were allocated to each group. At baseline, serum 25-OHD was similar (10.7±2.3 vs 11.41±1.9, P=0.23). At month 2, serum 25-OHD in the treatment group increased significantly to ≥ 30 ng/ ml, whereas serum 25-OHD in the control group remained unchanged (34.2±3.3 vs 10.6 10.6±2.2 ng/ml, P=0.001).
