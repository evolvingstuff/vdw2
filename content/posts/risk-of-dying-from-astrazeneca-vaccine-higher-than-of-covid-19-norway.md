 **"FHI has calculated the mortality rate from the AstraZeneca vaccine as 2.3 people per 100,000 vaccinated."** 

 **"A recent survey by the FHI in collaboration with Mindshare and Norstat, indicated that 76 percent of the respondents were sceptical of at least one of the vaccines, even though 82 percent were initially positive about getting vaccinated. Of the vaccines, AstraZeneca gained the highest level of <span style="color:#F00;">scepticism at 99 percent,</span> compared with Moderna (9 percent) and Pfizer (8 percent)."** 

 **Interestingly - Norway is lending their AstraZeneca doses to other countries**
