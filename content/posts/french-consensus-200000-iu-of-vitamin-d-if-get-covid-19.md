 **<span>[English Abstract]</span>** 

After 12 months of viral circulation, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people around the world, leaving hundreds of thousands dead. With the lack of effective therapy and vaccination against COVID-19, focusing on the immediate repurposing of existing drugs gives hope of curbing the pandemic. Vitamin D is a possible candidate discussed in a high amount of publications. Randomized clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduces the risk of respiratory infections. There are also many evidences that hypovitaminosis D is an independent (and easily modifiable) risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19 and death. Vitamin D supplementation is a simple, safe and inexpensive measure, which is effective in correcting hypovitaminosis D found in 40-50% of the French population and in more than 80% of adults with COVID-19. In this position paper, we propose simple regimens (adapted to the pharmaceutical forms currently available in France) for vitamin D supplementation in adults with or without COVID-19.

#### Christmas cards sent by the founder of VitaminDWiki had <span style="color:#F00;">200,000 IU of Vitamin D</span>

 **I wanted more of my friends to have quick access to enough vitamin D in case they got COVID-19 symptoms.** 

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/jpeg/200k-on-a-card.jpg" alt="image" width="400">

 **[Bought on Amazon US: 24 capsules for $15](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081W2TKF1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)** 

 **[Amazon US has 10+ suppliers of 50,000 IU bottles](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=%22vitamin+d%22+50%2C000&ref=nb_sb_noss_2)** 

Typically 20 cent per pill

 **[BioTech 50K capsules are preferred by VitaminDWiki](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-D3-Cholecalciferol-000IU-100/dp/B004HLD1K4/ref=sr_1_20?dchild=1&keywords=%22vitamin+d%22+50%2C000&qid=1608688543&sr=8-20)** 

#### <span style="color:red;">Nanoemulsion </span>forms of Vitamin D appear to be 4X faster if swished in mouth

 **at getting Vitamin D into the body, so I have used that form when local friends/family appeared to have been getting a COVID-19 infection.  4 times out of 4 the symptoms started to go away in 2 hours after swishing it in the mouth, and were totally gone in 24 hours. I have tried 6 different nanoemulsions (for inhaling), and slightly prefer Nutrasal** 

 **[Nutrasal - Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESKNGCW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)** 

The $24 cost and 4 ounce bottle size made it too expensive to include in my Chrismas cards

I still have 8 bottles of nanoemulsion to give out to friends who appear to be getting COVID-19.

#### One RCT used a <span style="color:red;">nanoemulsion</span>
