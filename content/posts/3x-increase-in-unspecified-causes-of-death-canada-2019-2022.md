#### Canada Reports 300% Increase in ‘Unspecified Causes’ of Death, Sparking Calls for Investigation

 **[Children's Health Defense](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/canada-300-percent-increase-unspecified-cause-death/?utm_source=luminate&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=defender&utm_id=20231213)** 

 **Leading Causes of Canadian Death in 2022** 

1. Cancer

1. Heart Disease, 

1. COVID-19

1. Accidents.

1. Unspecified Cause

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Note: Autopsies must be assigned to at least 1 cause of death</span>** 

* “Life expectancy for Canadians fell for third straight year in 2022, StatCan says,” 

* “More people died of COVID-19 in 2022 than in any other year since the pandemic began, report says.”

* “Since the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines, we have witnessed unprecedented deaths without antecedent disease. A large autopsy series published by [Hulscher et al](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4496137), found that 73.9% of the deaths after COVID-19 vaccination were due to problems caused by the shots.” -(not Canadian statistics)

* "The FDA and mainstream media are ignoring the fact that life insurers have been “sounding the alarm over these unexpected or, ‘excess,’ deaths, which claimed [158,000 more Americans](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=104676) in the first nine months of 2023 than in the same period in 2019,” Kory wrote."

 **Age-standardized Canadian mortality rate/100,000 population**
