Introduction: Studies indicate a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in both the general population and at-risk groups. Given the association between vitamin D deficiency and various diseases, addressing this concern becomes crucial, especially in situations where routine monitoring is challenging. 

Materials and methods: A systematic literature review of the current knowledge on vitamin D dosing in diverse at-risk populations and the application of the findings to a broader clinical perspective. 

Results: The reviewed studies revealed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients with musculoskeletal disorders, systemic connective tissue diseases, corticosteroid use, endocrine and metabolic conditions, malabsorption syndromes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and central nervous system diseases. Vitamin D deficiency was often more severe compared to the general population. Higher dosages of vitamin D beyond the recommended levels for the general population were shown to be effective in improving vitamin D status in these at-risk individuals. Additionally, some studies suggested a potential link between intermittent vitamin D administration and improved adherence. 

Conclusion: Simplified dosing could empower clinicians to address vitamin D deficiency, particularly in high-risk populations, even without routine monitoring. Further research is needed to establish the optimal dosing regimens for specific at-risk populations.

Introduction: Studies indicate a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in both the general population and at-risk groups. Given the association between vitamin D deficiency and various diseases, addressing this concern becomes crucial, especially in situations where routine monitoring is challenging. 

Materials and methods: A systematic literature review of the current knowledge on vitamin D dosing in diverse at-risk populations and the application of the findings to a broader clinical perspective. 

Results: The reviewed studies revealed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients with musculoskeletal disorders, systemic connective tissue diseases, corticosteroid use, endocrine and metabolic conditions, malabsorption syndromes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and central nervous system diseases. Vitamin D deficiency was often more severe compared to the general population. Higher dosages of vitamin D beyond the recommended levels for the general population were shown to be effective in improving vitamin D status in these at-risk individuals. Additionally, some studies suggested a potential link between intermittent vitamin D administration and improved adherence. 

Conclusion: Simplified dosing could empower clinicians to address vitamin D deficiency, particularly in high-risk populations, even without routine monitoring. Further research is needed to establish the optimal dosing regimens for specific at-risk populations.
