#### Research prioritization of interventions for the primary prevention of preterm birth: An international survey

Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2019 Jan 25. pii: S0301-2115(19)30048-X. [doi: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2019.01.021.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2019.01.021.)

 **International Survey ranked the possibilities** 

 **Vitamin D was the only supplement which was a research priority** 

Note: For thousands of years pregnancies averaged 40 weeks

[In 2006 March of Dimes stated the average pregnancy lasted only 39 weeks (new average)](https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20060323/typical-pregnancy-now-39-weeks-not-40#1)

OBJECTIVE:

To identify research priorities of interventions for the primary prevention of preterm birth (PTB), by conducting an international stakeholder survey.

STUDY DESIGN:

A prospective cross-sectional online survey was conducted in November 2016. Fifteen interventions to prevent spontaneous PTB were identified and ranked by stakeholders (n = 159) in the field of maternal and perinatal health research, using nine equally weighted criteria. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated and the interventions ranked accordingly.

RESULTS:

Respondents to the survey were from 46 different countries, mostly from low and middle-income countries (62%, 99/159) and were mainly clinicians (80%, 127/159). 

Of the fifteen interventions ranked, the following **five were identified as research priorities**  in the primary prevention of PTB: 

* dietary counselling and nutritional education,

* risk scoring, 

*  **vitamin D**  supplementation, 

* exercise and 

* antioxidant supplementation.

 **Criteria**

CONCLUSION:

We have identified research priorities of interventions to prevent spontaneous PTB through a global stakeholder survey. The interventions prioritized in this exercise can be used by researchers, grant funding bodies and research-policy decision makers to inform calls on future clinical trials or individual patient data meta-analyses on the primary prevention of PTB.
