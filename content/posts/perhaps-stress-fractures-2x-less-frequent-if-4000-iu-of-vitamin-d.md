BACKGROUND: Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> concentrations are associated with hip fractures, but the dose-response relationship of serum 25(OH)D with risk of stress fractures in young women is unknown.

OBJECTIVE: This nested case-control study in a cohort of female Navy recruits was designed to determine if those with low prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D concentrations had greater risk of stress fracture.

DESIGN: Sera were drawn in 2002-2009 from 600 women who were subsequently diagnosed with stress fracture of the tibia or fibula, and 600 matched controls, who did not experience a stress fracture. The 25(OH)D concentration was measured using the DiaSorin radioimmunoassay method. Controls were individually matched to cases on race (White, Black, or other); length of service (± 30 days); and day blood was drawn (± 2 days).

RESULTS: There was approximately half the risk of stress fracture in the top compared to bottom quintile of serum 25(OH)D concentration (OR?=?0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.76, p?<?0.01). The range of serum 25(OH)D in the lowest quintile was 1.5-19.7 (Mean 13.9) ng/ml, while in the highest it was 39.9-112 (Mean 49.7) ng/ml.

CONCLUSIONS: There was a monotonic inverse dose-response gradient between serum 25(OH)D and risk of stress fracture. 

There was double the risk of stress fractures of the tibia and fibula in women with serum 25(OH)D concentration?<?20?ng/ml, compared to those with ? 40?ng/ml. 

A target for prevention of stress fractures would be a serum 25(OH)D concentration of?>?40?ng/ml, achievable with  **4000 IU/day**  vitamin D(3) supplementation.

Young women with average 50 ng of vitamin D had 1/2 the fractures as those with average 14 ng

 **Suggests taking 4000 IU of vitamin D**
