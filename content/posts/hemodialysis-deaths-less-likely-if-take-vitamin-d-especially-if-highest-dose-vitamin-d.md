* Poor kidney ==> poor conversion of Vitamin D

* Very poor kidney ==> Hemodialysis (filtering of blood)

* Some Hemodialysis devices filter out Vitamin D

* Some Hemodialysis centers used to restore Vitamin D

   * [The US govt no longer compensates for vitamin D restoration, so centers are reluctqant to do it.](/posts/kidney-dialysis-clinics-reluctant-to-add-vitamin-d-treatment-as-they-are-not-reimbursed)
