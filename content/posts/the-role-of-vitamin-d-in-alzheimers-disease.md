Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most prevalent type of neurodegenerative dementia and the sixth leading cause of death worldwide. The so-called "non-calcemic actions" of vitamin D have been increasingly described, and its insufficiency has already been linked to the onset and progression of the main neurological diseases, including AD.

* Immune-mediated AÎ² plaque's phagocytosis and clearance, 

* immune response,

* oxidative stress, and 

* mitochondrial function 

are all influenced by vitamin D, and these functions are considered relevant in AD pathogenesis. 

However, it has been shown that the genomic vitamin D signaling pathway is already impaired in the AD brain, making things more complicated. In this paper, we aim to summarise the role of vitamin D in AD and review the results of the supplementation trials in AD patients.
