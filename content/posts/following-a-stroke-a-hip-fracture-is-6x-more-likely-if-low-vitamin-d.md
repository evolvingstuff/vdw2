BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Risk of hip fracture after stroke is 2 to 4 times that in a reference population. Osteomalacia is present in some patients with hip fractures in the absence of stroke, while disabled elderly stroke patients occasionally have severe deficiency in serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) (</=5 ng/mL). To determine the effects of vitamin D status on hip fracture risk, we prospectively studied a cohort of patients with hemiplegia after stroke who were aged at least 65 years.

METHODS:

We compared baseline serum indices of bone metabolism, bone mineral density, and hip fracture occurrence in stroke patients with serum 25-OHD </=25 nmol/L (</=10 ng/mL; deficient group, n=88) with findings in patients from the same cohort who had 25-OHD levels 26 to 50 nmol/L (10 to 20 ng/mL; insufficient group, n=76) or >/=51 nmol/L (>/=21 ng/mL; sufficient group, n=72).

RESULTS: Over a 2-year follow-up interval, hip fractures on the paretic side occurred in 7 patients in the deficient group and 1 patient in the insufficient group (P<0.05;  **hazard ratio=6.5** ), while no hip fractures occurred in the sufficient group. The 7 hip fracture patients in the deficient group had an osteomalacic 25-OHD level of <5 ng/mL. Higher age and severe immobilization were noted in the deficient group. Serum 25-OHD levels correlated positively with age, Barthel Index, and serum parathyroid hormone.

CONCLUSIONS: Elderly disabled stroke patients with serum 25-OHD concentrations </=12 nmol/L (</=5 ng/mL) have an increased risk of hip fracture. Immobilization and advanced age cause severe 25-OHD deficiency and consequent reduction of BMD.

### Vit D reduces bone loss after stroke

Top Stroke Rehabil. 2007 Jul-Aug;14(4):67-79.

Preventing hip fracture after stroke.

Hip fracture after stroke is a frequently occurring and costly complication. The bone quality of stroke survivors is affected by decreased mobility, asymmetric weight bearing, and impaired vitamin D stores. Simultaneously, the risk of falling after stroke is often increased by various impairments. Yet, attempts to limit falls are not enough to prevent fractures. Closer attention to bone health is also needed. Bone markers, which reflect the dynamics of bone remodeling, are becoming more available. Activity is necessary for bone health, but there are no clear guidelines for the type and amount of therapeutic exercise. New metrics for studying bone mineral density and exercise are on the horizon. Finally, there appears to be a role for bisphosphonate prophylaxis in a yet-to-be-defined at-risk population of stroke survivors. The purpose of this review is to discuss the setting for hip fracture after stroke and assess emerging treatments and technologies that may be used to combat the problem.
