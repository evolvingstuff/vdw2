# It seems to consider the benefits of Calcium by itself, and not in combination with vitamin D

### 'insufficient evidence' seems to indicate insufficient evidence when not combined with vitamin D)

## The following is a tiny subset of the information

# Effective for...

* Raising calcium levels in people who have low calcium.

* Preventing low calcium levels.

* Reversing high potassium levels, when given intravenously (by IV).

* Use as an antacid as calcium carbonate.

* Reducing phosphate levels in people with kidney disease.

## Likely effective for...

* Treating osteoporosis (weak bones). 

* Preventing bone loss caused by insufficient calcium in the diet. This can reduce the risk of breaking bones.  

* Reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)..

* Increasing fetal bone density in pregnant women with low calcium intake.

* Reducing bone loss in people taking drugs called corticosteroids, when used in combination with vitamin D.

* Reducing thyroid hormone levels in people with kidney failure.

## Possibly effective for...

* Reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. .

* High blood pressure. 

* High blood pressure in pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). 

* High cholesterol. 

* Reducing weight and body fat while dieting.

* Preventing stroke in women.

* Preventing fluoride poisoning in children when taken with vitamins C and D.

* Reducing tooth loss in elderly people.

## Possibly ineffective for...

* Preventing breast cancer in older (postmenopausal) women.

* Reducing lead levels in breast-feeding women.

## Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...

* Preventing falls. 

* Metabolic syndrome. 

* Cancer. 

* Pregnancy-related leg cramps. 

* Diabetes. .

* Lyme disease.

* Seizures.

* Other conditions.

## More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of calcium for these uses.
