* The words Coimbra or Brazil do not occur a single time in this review

* I feel certain that there are more people subscribed to Coimbra MS protocol groups on the web  (> 50,000) than all previous MS trial participants combined

* Trials reviewed in this study use up to 10,000 IU of Vitamin D daily

> Whereas the Coimbra protocol uses far more: 20,000 to 140,000 IU of Vitamin D daily

* Coimbra does not do randomized controlled trials â€“ for the following reasons

> 1) The benefit is given to all with MS (or other autoimmune diseases) - not just the half getting the Vitamin D

> 2) The Vitamin D dose size varies by 7X with the individual - not one dose-size fits all

> 3) The protocol is not monotherapy (contains more than just Vitamin D)

> 4) Vitamin D doses are so high as to cause hypercalcaemia if Calcium were not restricted and lots of water prescribed
