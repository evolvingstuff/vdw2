Background

Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by varying severity in attention deficit and hyperactivity. Studies have shown deficiencies in the serum level of magnesium and vitamin D in people with ADHD. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation on mental health in children with ADHD.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 66 children with ADHD. Participants were randomly allocated to receive both  **vitamin D (50,000 IU/week) plus magnesium (6 mg/kg/day)**  supplements (n = 33) or placebos (n = 33) for 8-weeks. Strengths and difficulties questionnaire was used to evaluate children’s mental health at baseline and the end of the study.

Results

After eight weeks of intervention, the serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 and magnesium increased significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group. Also, children receiving vitamin D plus magnesium showed a significant reduction in 

* emotional problems (p = 0.001), 

* conduct problems (p = 0.002), 

* peer problems (p = 0.001), 

* prosocial score (p = 0.007), 

* total difficulties (p = 0.001), 

* externalizing score (p = 0.001), and 

* internalizing score (p = 0.001) 

compared with children treated with the placebo.

Conclusion

Vitamin D (50,000 IU/week) and magnesium (6 mg/kg/day) co-supplementation for a duration of 8-weeks could improve the behavioral function and mental health of children with ADHD. However, further well-designed studies with a larger sample size are needed.
