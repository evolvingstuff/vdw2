The primary circulating form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D), is associated with multiple medical outcomes, including  **rickets, osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, and cancer** . In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4,501 persons of European ancestry drawn from five cohorts, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding group-specific component (vitamin D binding) protein, GC, on chromosome 4q12-13 that were associated with 25(OH)D concentrations: rs2282679 (P=2.0 x 10–30), in LD with rs7041, a nonsynonymous SNP (D432E; P=4.1 x 10-22), and rs1155563 (P = 3.8 x 10–25). Suggestive signals for association with 25(OH)D were also observed for SNPs in or near three other genes involved in vitamin D synthesis or activation: rs3829251 on chromosome 11q13.4 in NADSYN1 (encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetase; P=8.8 x 10-7), which was in high LD with rs1790349, located in DHCR7, the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase which synthesizes cholesterol from 7-dehydrocholesterol; rs6599638 in the region harboring the open reading frame 88 (C10orf88) on chromosome 10q26.13 in the vicinity of ACADSB (acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase), involved in cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis (P=3.3 x 10-7); and, rs2060793 on chromosome 11p15.2 in CYP2R1 (encoding a key C-25-hydroxylase that converts vitamin D3 to an active vitamin D receptor ligand; P=1.4 x 10–5). We genotyped SNPs in these four regions in 2,221 additional samples and confirmed strong genome-wide significant associations with 25(OH)D through meta-analysis with the GWAS data for GC (P=1.8 x 10-49), NADSYN1/DHCR7 (P=3.4 x 10-9), and CYP2R1 (P=2.9 x 10-17), but not C10orf88 (P=2.4 x 10-5).
