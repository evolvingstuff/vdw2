Aging is characterized by significant physiological changes, with the degree of decline varying significantly among individuals. The preservation of intrinsic capacity over the course of an individual’s lifespan is fundamental for healthy aging. Locomotion, which entails the capacity for independent movement, is intricately connected with various dimensions of human life, including cognition, vitality, sensory perception, and psychological well-being. Notably, skeletal muscle functions as a pivotal nexus within this intricate framework. Any perturbation in its functionality can manifest as compromised physical performance and an elevated susceptibility to frailty. Magnesium is an essential mineral that plays a central role in approximately 800 biochemical reactions within the human body. Its distinctive physical and chemical attributes render it an indispensable stabilizing factor in the orchestration of diverse cellular reactions and organelle functions, thereby rendering it irreplaceable in processes directly impacting muscle health. This narrative review offers a comprehensive exploration of the pivotal role played by magnesium in maintaining skeletal muscle integrity, emphasizing the critical importance of maintaining optimal magnesium levels for promoting healthy aging.
