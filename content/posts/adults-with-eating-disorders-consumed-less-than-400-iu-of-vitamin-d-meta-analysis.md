#### Dietary intake of adults with eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis

J Psychiatr Res . 2024 May 16:175:393-404. [doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.05.038](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.05.038)

Studies have confirmed the link between altered dietary intake and eating disorders (EDs), although no systematic assessment of this research exists. Rigorous synthesis of dietary intake in anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and similar EDs is needed to explore similarities and differences. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, we conducted a systematic review and quantitative synthesis of studies of dietary intake. Searches of three electronic databases resulted in thirty-nine included studies. Meta-analyses of subsets of these studies were undertaken to summarise macronutrient intake across AN, BN, and BED. Study quality was assessed using the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist, with ratings either Positive (k = 27) or Neutral (k = 12). Adults with AN had low energy intake and those with BED reported elevated macronutrient intake. Individuals with BN reported wide variation in energy intake, including some of the highest estimates. Individuals with AN were likely to under-consume key micronutrients, with sodium potentially over-consumed in BN and BED. **Vitamin D was under-consumed across all disorders.**  This meta-analysis highlights important diagnostic differences and synthesises dietary intake in EDs, with particular relevance to risk assessment and treatment.
