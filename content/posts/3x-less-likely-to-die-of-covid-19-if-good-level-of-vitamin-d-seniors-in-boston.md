Objective

To determine the association between vitamin D status and morbidity and mortality in adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review study in COVID-19 patients aged ≥18 years old hospitalized at Boston University Medical Center between March 1 – August 4, 2020. All studied patients were tested positive for COVID-19 and had serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D results measured within one year prior to the date of positive tests. Medical information was retrieved from the electronic medical record and were analyzed to determine the association between vitamin D status and hospital morbidity and mortality.

Results

Among the 287 patients, 100 (36%) patients were vitamin D-sufficient [25(OH)D >30 ng/mL](25(OH)D%20>30%20ng/mL) and 41 (14%) patients died during the hospitalization. Multivariate analysis in patients aged ≥65 years old revealed that 

* vitamin D sufficiency [25(OH)D ≥30 ng/mL](25(OH)D%20≥30%20ng/mL) was statistically significantly associated 

   * with decreased odds of death (adjusted  **OR 0.33** , 95%CI, 0.12–0.94), 

* acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted  **OR 0.22** , 95%CI, 0.05–0.96), and 

* severe sepsis/septic shock (adjusted  **OR 0.26** , 95%CI, 0.08–0.88), 

after adjustement for potential confounders. 

Among patients with  **body mass index <30 kg/m**  2, vitamin D sufficiency was statistically significantly associated with a decreased odds of death (adjusted  **OR 0.18** , 95%CI, 0.04–0.84). No significant association was found in the subgroups of patients aged <65 years old or BMI ≥30 kg/m 2.

Conclusion

We revealed an independent association between vitamin D sufficiency defined by serum 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/mL and decreased risk of mortality from COVID-19 in elderly patients and patients without obesity.
