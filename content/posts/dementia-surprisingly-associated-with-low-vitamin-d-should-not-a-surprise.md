### [Depression, Low Vitamin D Major Risk Factors for Dementia](http://www.healthline.com/health-news/depression-and-vitamin-d-080614) Healthline

Press statement "We expected to find an association between low vitamin D levels and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease,  **but the results were surprising**  — we actually found that the association was twice as strong as we anticipated,”

 **Abstract results** 

During a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, 171 participants developed all-cause dementia, including 102 cases of Alzheimer disease. Using Cox proportional hazards models, the multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>) for incident all-cause dementia in participants who were severely 25(OH)D deficient (<25 nmol/L) and deficient (≥25 to <50 nmol/L) were 2.25 (95% CI: 1.23–4.13) and 1.53 (95% CI: 1.06–2.21) compared to participants with sufficient concentrations (≥50 nmol/L). The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for incident Alzheimer disease in participants who were severely 25(OH)D deficient and deficient compared to participants with sufficient concentrations were 2.22 (95% CI: 1.02–4.83) and 1.69 (95% CI: 1.06–2.69). In multivariate adjusted penalized smoothing spline plots, the risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease markedly increased below a threshold of 50 nmol/L.

BACKGROUND::

High vitamin D status has been hypothesized to protect against dementia. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level predicts dementia risk.

METHODS::

The study was based on the Mini-Finland Health Survey. The study population consisted of 5010 men and women, aged 40-79 years, and free of dementia at baseline. During a 17-year follow up, 151 incident cases of dementia (International Classification of Diseases, revision 8, code 290) occurred, according to population registers. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was determined from serum samples frozen at -20°C and stored at baseline.

RESULTS::

Among women, these with higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations showed a reduced risk of dementia. 

The hazard ratio between the highest and lowest quartiles of serum 25(OH)D was  **0.33**  (95% confidence interval = 0.15-0.73) in women 

and 0.74 (0.29-1.88) in men, after adjustment for age, month of blood draw, education, marital status, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, blood pressure, plasma fasting glucose, serum triglycerides, and serum total cholesterol.

CONCLUSIONS::

The results are in line with the hypothesis that low vitamin D status may be a risk factor for dementia.
