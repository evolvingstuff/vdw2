* "Recently, another CNS-rich protein has been implicated in rapid intracellular signalling induced by 1,25(OH)2D3, namely Protein-Disulphide-Isomerase, family A member 3 ( **PDIA3** ), a membranebound  **vit-D recepto** r(70). Notably, the PDIA3 expression in brain is orders of magnitude greater than hepatic and renal PDIA3 expression, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, regional areas critical to cognitive function (Fig. 1)"

* "Consistent with the regional distribution of VDR, CYP27B1 was clearly indicated throughout the entirety of the CA1, CA2 and CA3- HPF regions, brain regions pivotal for spatial learning and memory formation and considered one of most vulnerable regions in Alzheimer’s disease pathology

* "In Alzheimer’s disease, hypovitaminosis-D is associated with a 2.4 fold increased risk for cognitive impairment(14)"
