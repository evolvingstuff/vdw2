Aims A significant proportion of cardiac surgical patients develop critical post-operative complications. We aimed to investigate the association of pre-operative 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels with  **major cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)**  in cardiac surgical patients.

Methods and results From January 2010 to August 2011, we consecutively measured circulating 25(OH)D in 4418 operated patients. 

Of the study cohort, 38.0% had deficient 25(OH)D values (<30 nmol/L) and additional 32.3% had insufficient values (30–49.9 nmol/L), whereas only 3.1% had values >100 nmol/L. 

The incidence of MACCE was 11.5%. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, the odds ratio of MACCE at deficient, inadequate, and high 25(OH)D levels was 2.23 <span>[95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31–3.79]</span>, 1.73 (95% CI: 1.01–2.96) and 2.34 (95% CI: 1.12–4.89), respectively, compared with 25(OH)D levels of 75–100 nmol/L. 

A  **U-shaped**  association with circulating 25(OH)D was also present for duration of mechanical ventilatory support and intensive care unit stay. 

Multivariable-adjusted 6- and 12-month mortality were higher in patients with deficient 25(OH)D levels compared with patients with 25(OH)D levels of 75–100 nmol/L.

Conclusion Deficient 25(OH)D levels are prevalent in cardiac surgical patients in Central Europe and are independently associated with the risk of MACCE. Further research should clarify the potential of vitamin D supplements in reducing cardiovascular risk in vitamin D-deficient patients and also the mechanisms leading to adverse effects on the cardiovascular system in the small group of patients with 25(OH)D levels >100 nmol/L.
