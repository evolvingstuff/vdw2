### Racial disparities in preterm birth rates and short inter-pregnancy interval. An overview.

Objective. We seek to expand on a biopsychosocial framework underlying the etiology of excess preterm birth experienced by African-American women by exploring short inter-pregnancy intervals as a partial explanatory factor. 

Methods. We determine whether inter-pregnancy interval is associated with preterm birth, what the underlying causal mechanism may be, whether African-American women are more likely than Caucasian women to have short intervals, and whether achieving an optimal interval will result in reduced African-American-Caucasian gap in preterm births. Main outcome measures. Crude and adjusted odds ratios for preterm birth, with the referent group being the interval closest to the "ideal" of 18-23 months and the exposed group having intervals <12 months or some subset of that inter-pregnancy interval. 

Results.  **Inter-pregnancy interval less than 6 months increases preterm birth by about 40 percent.**  The mechanism may be through failure to replenish maternal nutritional stores. While there may not be an interaction between race and short inter-pregnancy interval, short intervals can explain about 4% of the African-American-Caucasian gap in preterm birth because __African-American women are approximately 1.8 times as likely to have inter-pregnancy intervals of <6 months–. Limited studies indicate that optimal intervals can be achieved through appropriate counseling and health care. 

Conclusions. Excess risk for preterm birth may be reduced by up to 8% among African-Americans and up to 4% among Caucasians through increasing inter-pregnancy intervals to the optimal length of 18-23 months.
