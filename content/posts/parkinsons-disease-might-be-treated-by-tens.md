#### TENS might treat Parkinson's [Perplexity AI Feb 2025](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/might-tens-treat-parkinson-s-d-fxObM8YmTh6.cuVruSJ76Q%20)

TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) shows promise in treating several symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Recent research demonstrates that TENS and similar electrical stimulation devices can help reduce both motor and non-motor symptoms [4](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms). A portable stimulation headset using vestibular stimulation through the ear showed significant improvements in mobility and decision-making, with benefits lasting up to 5 weeks after treatment [4](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms).

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Treatment Areas and Effects</span>** 

 **Motor Symptoms** 

* Helps improve balance and motor control through electronic stimulation behind the ears [3](https://www.homecareassistancejeffersonco.com/parkinsons-electric-noise/)

* Can reduce tremors, though effectiveness varies among patients [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859162/)

* May decrease stiffness and muscle rigidity

 **Additional Benefits** 

* Non-invasive and painless treatment option [4](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms)

* Has a favorable side-effect profile [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677241/)

* Can be self-administered at home [4](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms)

 **<span style="color:#00F;">Limitations</span>** 

The treatment is still under development, with some important considerations:

* The mechanism of tremor suppression is not fully understood [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859162/)

* Effectiveness varies among patients, and may only work for some individuals [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859162/)

* While TENS can suppress tremors, it may slightly reduce voluntary movement speed, though it doesn't prevent voluntary movements [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859162/)

Research is ongoing, and while TENS shows promise as a complementary treatment for Parkinson's symptoms, more studies are needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential [4](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms).

!!!!TENS might treat Parkinson&#39;s [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/might-tens-treat-parkinson-s-d-fxObM8YmTh6.cuVruSJ76Q |Perplexity AI Feb 2025]
TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) shows promise in treating several symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease. Recent research demonstrates that TENS and similar electrical stimulation devices can help reduce both motor and non-motor symptoms [https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms|4]. A portable stimulation headset using vestibular stimulation through the ear showed significant improvements in mobility and decision-making, with benefits lasting up to 5 weeks after treatment [https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms|4].
__~~#00F:Treatment Areas and Effects~~__
__Motor Symptoms__
*Helps improve balance and motor control through electronic stimulation behind the ears [https://www.homecareassistancejeffersonco.com/parkinsons-electric-noise/|3]
*Can reduce tremors, though effectiveness varies among patients [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8859162/|5]
*May decrease stiffness and muscle rigidity
__Additional Benefits__
*Non-invasive and painless treatment option [https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/new-device-improves-parkinsons-symptoms|4]
