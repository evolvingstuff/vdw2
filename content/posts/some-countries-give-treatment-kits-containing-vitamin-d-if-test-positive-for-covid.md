#### What happened the moment after you tested positive for Covid?

 **[Substack Digger](https://philharper.substack.com/p/what-happened-the-moment-after-you) July 22, 2022** 

* "In most of Europe, absolutely no treatment at all was offered to you at the moment you tested positive."

* "As early as August 2020 in El Salvador, a country with less than 1% of the GDP of the UK, evidence-based treatment kits were being given out all across the country. If you tested positive for Covid-19, they wanted a medical intervention right at that very moment. Given the emergency we were in, such a policy surely seems logical?"

##### 2 bottles of Vitamin D in one kit!
