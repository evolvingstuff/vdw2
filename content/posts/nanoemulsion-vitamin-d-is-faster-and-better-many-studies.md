#### Vitamin D nanoemulsions 3.9X more bioavailable than Vitamin D micelles – Feb 2018

 **The Efficacy of Nanoemulsion-Based Delivery to Improve Vitamin D Absorption: Comparison of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies**

##### Nanoemulsions result in more uniform response than other forms

<img src="https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/webp/uniform-response.webp" alt="image" width="400">

Scope: Vitamin D (VD) is a fat-soluble vitamin that has a wide range of skeletal and non-skeletal functions. Although it can be synthesized through sun exposure and obtained from fortified foods, VD inadequacy is epidemic worldwide. Therefore innovative strategies are necessary for improving VD status. The present study examined VD absorption via nanoscale delivery systems.

Methods and results: We examine the physical characteristics and in vitro bioaccessibility of cholecalciferol (VD3 ) in nanoemulsion using a simulated gastrointestinal tract system. To evaluate the in vivo bioavailability, we orally administer three groups of mice with VD3 nanoemulsion, VD3 coarse emulsion, or vehicle nanoemulsion without VD3 , and the serum 25(OH)D3 is measured using radioactive immunoassay. The nanoemulsion-based delivery system increases the in vitro bioaccessibility by  **3.94-folds**  (p < 0.05), as indicated by the concentration of vitamin D3 in micelles. Our animal study shows that, when compared to the vehicle group, the coarse emulsion numerically increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 36%, whereas the nanoemulsion statistically significantly increases the serum 25(OH)D3 by 73% (p < 0.01).

Conclusion: Our findings indicate that a nanoemulsion-based delivery system is a promising approach to improve VD bioavailability, and further studies are warranted to determine its efficacy in humans.

#### Nanoemulsion vitamin D 40% more bio-available than fat-soluble - RCT Jan 2023

 **An open-label, randomized, crossover study to evaluate the bioavailability of nanoemulsion versus conventional fat-soluble formulation of cholecalciferol in healthy participants**

Background

Nanoemulsion preparations of cholecalciferol available in the market claim to have better bioavailability than the conventional fat-soluble cholecalciferol. However, limited data are available in humans for such preparations. We, therefore, compared the relative bioavailability of two formulations of 60,000 IU cholecalciferol (nanoemulsion oral solution, water-miscible vitamin D3 <span>[test]</span> vs soft gelatin capsules <span>[reference]</span>) in healthy adult participants.

Methods

In this randomized, open-label, two-sequence, single-dose, two-way crossover study (CTRI/2018/05/013839), Indian participants aged 18–45 years received single dose of nanoemulsion and capsule formulations, under fasting conditions. Blood samples collected over 120 h were assessed to determine cholecalciferol concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the concentration-time curve up to 120 h <span>[AUC0–120h]</span>, maximum observed drug concentration <span>[Cmax]</span>, time to reach maximum drug concentration <span>[Tmax]</span>, terminal half-life <span>[T½el]</span>, and terminal elimination rate constant <span>[Kel]</span>) were estimated using baseline corrected data and analyzed using analysis of variance.

Results

Among the 24 eligible participants, the relative bioavailability of nanoemulsion was significantly higher than the capsules by 36% (p = 0.0001) based on AUC0–120h. Similarly, Cmax of the nanoemulsion was significantly higher by 43% (p = 0.0001) than that of the capsules. The intra-participant variability for AUC0–120h and Cmax were 23.22% and 26.51%, respectively. The Tmax, T½el, and Kel were comparable for both the formulations. No adverse effects were noted with either of the two formulations.

Conclusions

Nanoemulsion oral solution of cholecalciferol showed a greater bioavailability compared with soft gelatin capsules, under fasting conditions, in healthy human participants.

#### Nanoemulsion 36% more bioavailable than fat soluble forms (single 60,000 IU dose) - Dec 2019

 **Bioavailability of nanoemulsion formulations vs conventional fat soluble preparations of cholecalciferol (D3) – An overview**

Vitamin D deficiency is recognized as a pandemic affecting all ages and strata of population. The endogenous cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D is insufficient to maintain normal body requirement which necessitates the need for vitamin D supplementation or food-fortification. Conventional fat-soluble preparations of vitamin D have been traditionally used for prevention and therapeutic purposes. Recent advances in technology have enabled delivery of vitamin D through nanoemulsion formulations which ensure higher absorption and drug delivery. The following review briefly discusses the issues of bioavailability of nanoemulsion preparation of vitamin D vis-a-vis conventional fat soluble preparations.

"...a single oral dose of 60,000 IU in healthy participants. The results showed that relative bioavailability in terms of serum levels of cholecalciferol following supplementation with nano preparation of vitamin D3 was significantly higher than fat-soluble D3 by 36%(P ¼ 0.001) based on AUC 0-120. "

The  **nanoemulsions are considered superior to conventional vitamin D**  preparations for the following reasons: 

* a) It has greater therapeutic role in patients with malabsorption syndromes due to 

   * Inflammatory bowel disease, 

   * Celiac disease, 

   * Short bowel syndrome, 

   * Hepatobiliary disorders, 

   * Pancreatic insufficiency and 

   * Bariatric surgery who suffer from a deficiency of essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin D, 

* b) Better compliance as it can be taken directly or with water/juice etc. 

* c) Vitamin D nanoemulsions may also have also greater hepato-protective effect against high-fat diet-induced liver injury as observed in rats compared to conventional oral vitamin D preparations.
