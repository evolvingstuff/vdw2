#### [Telegraph UK - Nov 16, 2021](http://m.email3.telegraph.co.uk/nl/jsp/m.jsp?c=%40PMo4V4iQAyU%2F2VIrWHB2r6CJoDjLWmxNBSCO27oswu4%3D&WT.mc_id=e_DM1523480&WT.tsrc=email&etype=Edi_GHS_New_Daily&utmsource=email&utm_medium=Edi_GHS_New_Daily20211116&utm_campaign=DM1523480)

The NHS is preparing for the prospect of an annual Covid-19 booster vaccine programme - should one be required, the head of the NHS in England has said.

It is still not clear whether Covid-19 vaccine top-ups will be needed every year - similar to the annual winter flu jab programme - but the NHS is already putting plans in place should it be required to deliver a yearly vaccine campaign, Amanda Pritchard said.

The chief executive of NHS England also suggested that there could be "further expansions" to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice on vaccines.

On Monday, the JCVI recommended that the booster programme should be extended to include all adults aged 40 and over, as well making new recommendations for second jabs for 16 and 17-year-olds.

In a speech to the NHS Providers annual conference, Ms Pritchard said: "We had the latest advice yesterday from the JCVI on extending (boosters) to the over-40s, as well as giving second doses to 16 and 17 year olds, and I think we can expect further expansions in the future.

"We are already thinking about how we can do annual booster vaccines, if they are needed."
