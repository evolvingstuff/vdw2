There is increasing evidence showing the role of fatty acids and their derived lipid intermediates in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass synthesis and function. However, the role of omega-3 fatty acids remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the potential effects of omega-3 fatty acids on sarcopenia-related performances among the elderly. Eligible literature and reports of randomized controlled trials were comprehensively searched from the PubMed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases until July 2018. A total of 10 articles were available for the meta-analysis. There were minor benefits for muscle mass gain (0.33 kg; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.62) and timed up and go performance (−0.30 s; 95% CI: −0.43, −0.17). Subgroup analyses regarding muscle mass and walk speed indicated that omega-3 fatty acid supplements at more than 2 g/day may contribute to muscle mass gain (0.67 kg; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.18) and improve walking speed, especially for those receiving more than 6 months of intervention (1.78 m/sec; 95% CI: 1.38, 2.17). Our findings provide some insight into the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on muscle mass, especially for those taking supplements at more than 2 g/day. We also observed that a long period of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation may improve walking speed.

##### Lean body mass increased with Omega-3 (no change with resistance exercise)

Sarcopenia negatively affects skeletal muscle mass and function in older adults. Omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acid supplementation, with or without resistance exercise training (RET), is suggested to play a role as a therapeutic component to prevent or treat the negative effects of sarcopenia. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on the impact of ω-3 fatty acid supplementation with or without RET on measures of muscle mass and function in older adults (≥55 y). The data sources included SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and Medline. All the study types involving ω-3 fatty acid supplementation on measures of muscle mass and function in older adults (without disease) were included. The mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and pooled effects assessed. Sixteen studies (1660 females, 778 males) met our inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. ω-3 fatty acid supplementation did not impact lean tissue mass (SMD 0.09 <span>[−0.10, 0.28]</span>). Benefits were observed for lower body strength (SMD 0.54 <span>[0.33, 0.75]</span>), timed-up-and-go (MD 0.29 <span>[0.23, 0.35]</span>s), and 30-s sit-to-stand performance (MD 1.93 <span>[1.59, 2.26]</span> repetitions) but not walking performance (SMD −0.01 <span>[−0.10, 0.07]</span>) or upper body strength (SMD 0.05 <span>[−0.04, 0.13]</span>). Supplementing with ω-3 fatty acids may improve the lower-body strength and functionality in older adults
