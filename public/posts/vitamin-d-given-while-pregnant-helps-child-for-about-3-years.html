Accordingly, recent Endocrine Society guidelines strongly support supplementation in pregnancy, also underlining that without consensus on optimal maternal vitamin D levels, routine screening is currently irrelevant. Knowledge of organ-specific effects of vitamin D and its association with maternal vitamin D status may aid to optimize vitamin D supplementation. This systematic review outlines the proposed next-generation effects of vitamin D supplementation > 400 IU/d, and explores whether such effects are attributed to a specific maternal vitamin D level obtained during pregnancy.</p><p>A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase according to the PRISMA guidelines, focusing on health outcomes from ten days post-partum and beyond.</p><p>Of the 2,383 screened articles, 39 were included. In 11 of 16 studies, vitamin D supplementation reduced respiratory tract infections in the first years of life. Growth or bone development benefits were observed in six of 12 studies. Positive effects on neurodevelopment and reduced autoimmune risk (diabetes-related antibodies) were noted, although further research is needed to determine the role of vitamin D. Very few studies have measured vitamin D concentrations, but even 1,600 IU/d supplementation was associated with high frequency of infant vitamin D insufficiency.</p><p>Current recommendations may not ensure sufficient vitamin D levels at birth, among others, increasing the risk of early-life infections. Further studies linking maternal and infant vitamin D levels to specific outcomes would aid in personalized nutritional advice during pregnancy and improve next-generation health.</p><p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-pdf" style=margin-right:.3em></i><a href=https://d1bk1kqxc0sym.cloudfront.net/attachments/pdf/supplementation-on-childhood-health-compresspdf.pdf>Download the PDF from VitaminDWiki</a></strong></p><hr><h4 id=what-does-the-attached-study-conclude-about-the-years-of-delay-between-vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-and-the-benefits-observed-perplexity-aihttpswwwperplexityaisearchwhat-does-the-attached-study-c-irmyhl02t2gplr_obnsanq>What does the attached study conclude about the years of delay between vitamin D during pregnancy and the benefits observed <a href=https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-does-the-attached-study-c-iRMyhL02T2GpLr_obNSAnQ>Perplexity AI</a></h4><p>The study reveals several important timing patterns</p><p>  regarding the benefits of maternal vitamin D supplementation:</p><p><strong>Immediate to Early Life Benefits</strong></p><ul><li><p>Respiratory infections and immune system effects were most prominent in the first years of life</p></li><li><p>Growth and anthropometric benefits were observed from birth through 24 months</p></li><li><p>Early protective effects against diabetes-related autoantibodies were seen at 12 months but disappeared by 2.5 years</p></li></ul><p><strong>Medium-Term Benefits</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bone mineralization and density benefits were detected at ages 4-6 years</p></li><li><p>Dental enamel defects showed significant improvements when examined at age 6</p></li><li><p>Language development effects became evident at 24 months, while motor development benefits were seen earlier at 18 months</p></li></ul><p><strong>Diminishing Effects</strong></p><ul><li><p>Asthma and allergy protection appeared to weaken over time, with stronger effects in early years that became less significant by age 6</p></li><li><p>The protective effect against atopic eczema was strongest at 12 months but weakened significantly by 24-48 months</p></li><li><p>Initial benefits for diabetes-related autoimmunity did not persist beyond early childhood</p></li></ul><p>The study concludes that while many benefits are observable in early life, the effects may diminish over time as children&rsquo;s own vitamin D intake and production become more important factors in their health outcomes.</p><hr><h4 id=appears-unaware-of-risks-when-vitamin-d-is-not-given-during-pregnancy-2-examples>Appears unaware of risks when vitamin D is not given during pregnancy: 2 examples</h4><ul><li><p><a href=/posts/multiple-sclerosis-much-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-many-studies style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Multiple Sclerosis much more likely if low vitamin D during pregnancy –many studies">higher risks of MS as adult</a>,</p></li><li><p><a href=/posts/schizophrenia-44-percent-more-likely-if-low-vitamin-d-at-birth-8-ng style=color:red;text-decoration:underline title="This post/category does not exist yet: Schizophrenia 44 percent more likely if low vitamin D at birth (8 ng) – Dec 2018">Schizophrenia</a> 70 years after birth</p></li></ul></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1748384358"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1748384358",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1748384358"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1748384358"></script><script src="/js/search-results-panel.js?v=1748384358"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1748384358"></script></body></html>
