#### [Women Report Worse Side Effects After a Covid Vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/health/vaccine-side-effects-women-men.html) New York Times March 8, 2021

* "Among the side effects reported to the agency, 79.1 percent came from women, even though only 61.2 percent of the vaccines had been administered to women."

* "Nearly all of the rare anaphylactic reactions to Covid-19 vaccines have occurred among women, too. C.D.C. researchers reported that all 19 of the individuals who had experienced such a reaction to the Moderna vaccine have been female, and that women made up 44 of the 47 who have had anaphylactic reactions to the Pfizer vaccine."

* "In a 2013 study, scientists with the C.D.C. and other institutions found that **four times as many women**  as men between the ages of 20 and 59 reported allergic reactions after receiving the 2009 pandemic flu vaccine,"

* " 80 percent of autoimmune diseases afflict women. . . . "

   * Perhaps women do not need as large a dose of vaccine
