 **Abstract** 

Ever since the emergence of the hypothesis that linked the aetiology of schizophrenia with abnormal

membrane phospholipids composition, an increasing number of evidences have suggested reduced

membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with schizophrenia. This has led to a conduct of several

studies to evaluate the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid supplement in the modification of membrane

phospholipids and treatment of schizophrenia. The two main omega-3 fatty acid classes, EPA and DHA,

play a vital role in membranes. This project work reviews omega-3 fatty acid studies and summarizes their

outcomes. Eight original articles (nine studies) were reviewed. Six out of nine studies measured RBC

membrane fatty acids levels and all six studies reported a significant increase in EPA after EPA

supplement. Two studies reported increased DHA post omega-3 fatty acid and DHA supplement,

respectively. One study observed a dose-dependent increment in DHA after EPA supplement. Improved

symptoms were observed in seven studies, while one study found a worsening of symptoms in patients

with low baseline PUFA. Moreover, out of the six studies that evaluated the correlation between symptom

change and membrane fatty acids change, three studies observed a correlation between increased EPA and

symptom improvement. One study reported an increased AA associated with improved symptoms, in

contrast to another study, which found a correlation between increased AA and worsened symptoms. The

conclusion from this project work is that EPA supplement can increase the EPA levels in membranes;

however, its therapeutic effect in schizophrenia requires further investigation using larger studies.
