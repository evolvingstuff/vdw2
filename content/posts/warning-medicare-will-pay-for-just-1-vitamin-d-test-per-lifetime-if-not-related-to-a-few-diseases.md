## Comment by VitaminDWiki

US is foolishly joining countries such as Canada and Australia in limiting  short-term health costs by restricting vitamin D tests

[Vitamin D tests have been proven to lower, not raise health care costs](/tags/vitamin-d-tests-have-been-proven-to-lower-not-raise-health-care-costs.html) (Lancet 2012)

A person will typically just need a single vitamin D test 4 months after having a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose

The vitamin D test is to confirm that the maintenance dose chosen is large enough

If your vitamin D level is not high enough and the govt does not pay for additional testing

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we recommend that you get tested commercially, at far lower cost than at most hospitals.

#### <span style="color:#00F;">Update March 2021 - finally realized why vitamin D tests are no longer paid for</span>

1. Doctor orders for a vitamin D test (often $200 in US hospitals)

1. Doctor gets the results and prescribes 2,000 IU of vitamin D

   * Which is rarely enough, but that is what they were taught was a safe level decades ago

   * Sometimes they prescribe vitamin D2 - h has been documented to sometimes LOWER levels of Vitamin D3

1. Patient gets little or no benefit from such a small amount that they stop taking it after a month or so

1. Medicare sees no benefit in the test - so has decided to no pay for testing in the future.
