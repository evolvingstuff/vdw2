Vitamin D synthesis takes place in the skin due to solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. Several studies have shown the association between low sun exposure, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and a lack of vitamin D synthesis. Since such synthesis in the body depends on the exposure of the skin to solar UVB radiation (290-320 nm), experimental measurements of this type of solar radiation are important. Tarapaca University in Arica, Chile, established a solar UV radiation laboratory in 2006 and since then this laboratory has performed systematic experimental solar UVB measurements using a calibrated biometer instrument. The results, which are presented in the current study, showed the association between NMSC and MSC rates, and the time required to produce 1,000 IU vitamin D with latitudinal variation. Solar UV index (UVI) levels reported in 6 cities from the north to the south of Chile indicated that the UVI ratio of monthly mean values was 1.8 times higher in Arica than in Punta Arenas in January (summer in Chile), whereas it was 14 times higher in June (winter). This factor is an important consideration, since vitamin D synthesis is directly associated with the exposure of individuals to solar UVB radiation. A similar trend was observed in Antofagasta, Santiago, Concepcion, Valdivia and Punta Arenas. It can be concluded from these data that there is a direct association between NMSC rates and mortality, and UVB radiation, meaning that this type of cancer would not depend on vitamin D synthesis and therefore on calcium uptake. By contrast, MSC rates increased with decreased levels of vitamin D, and thus calcium uptake, in all cities, with the only exception being Punta Arenas.
