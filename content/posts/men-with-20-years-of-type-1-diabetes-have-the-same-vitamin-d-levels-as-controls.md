#### Vitamin D status in longstanding type 1 diabetes and controls. Association with upper extremity impairments

Ups J Med Sci. 2023 Nov 22:128. [doi: 10.48101/ujms.v128.9888](https://doi.org/10.48101/ujms.v128.9888)

Background: Patients with type 1 diabetes have a high prevalence of upper extremity impairments (UEIs), such as frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, and trigger finger. The UEIs are strongly associated with activity limitations and impaired quality of life. The etiology of the UEI is not clear. Vitamin D deficiency has been considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and in the development of macro- and microvascular complications in diabetes.

Aim: To characterize vitamin D status in a large population of patients with type 1 diabetes, if vitamin D deficiency is associated with metabolic factors and possible association with UEI.

Material and methods: Patients who diagnosed before 35 years of age, whose diabetes duration >20 years, and who are not older than 65 years were invited to participate in this cross-sectional case-control, multicenter study. Controls matched for age and sex were obtained from the national population registry. Fasting blood samples were collected and stored at -80°C until analyzed regarding 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D3) by a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric method (LC-MS/MS).

Results: Vitamin D levels varied with season as expected in the northern hemisphere. The association between 25(OH)D3 and clinical variables was analyzed in a univariate general linear model, which indicated no difference in 25(OH)D3 in men with and without diabetes  **but higher values in women with diabetes** . About 30% of both patients and controls had vitamin D deficiency (≤50 nmol/L). Analyzed by binary logistic regression UEIs was not associated with 25(OH)D3 levels. In both patients and controls, 25(OH)D3 was correlated to apolipoprotein A1 (r = 0.153; 0.220, P < 0.001).

Conclusion: In patients with type 1 diabetes and a duration of 20 years or more, vitamin D level is not lower than in nondiabetic controls and is not associated with UEIs.
