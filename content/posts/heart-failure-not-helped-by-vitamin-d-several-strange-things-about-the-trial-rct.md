#### Effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality in heart failure (EVITA): a 3-year randomized clinical trial with 4000 IU vitamin D daily.

#### This RCT did NOT find a benefit

 **Many strange things** 

1. The RCT listing only mentions  [Ergocalciferols](/posts/overview-vitamin-d3-not-d2), but not D3, yet the publication says it used D3

1. More that half of the people decided to not participate in the RCT. A study has found serious problems with RCT results when so many did not participate

1. This RCT selected only those people with chronic heart failure (80% had pacemakers), not the general public. Perhaps people with chronic heart failure are more likely to have poor a [Vitamin D Receptor](/posts/vitamin-d-receptor) than the healthy public, and thus would need significantly higher levels of Vitamin D (> 50 ng?) to get enough Vitamin D to their heart cells.

1. The average vitamin D level achieved was 40 ng – where Vitamin D starts to help the healthy

> RCT failed to compare results for those < 40 ng and > 40 ng 

1. About 45% of the participants did not continue to take the vitamin D for the entire RCT - were those people healthier?
