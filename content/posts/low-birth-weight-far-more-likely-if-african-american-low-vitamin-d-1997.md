Background In the United States, the birth weights of infants of black women are lower than those of infants of white women. The extent to which the lower birth weights among blacks are related to social or genetic factors is unclear.

Methods We used vital records for 1980 through 1995 from Illinois to determine the distribution of birth weights among infants born to three groups of women — U.S.-born blacks, African-born blacks, and U.S.-born whites.

Results The mean birth weight of 44,046 infants of U.S.-born white women was 3446 g, that of 3135 infants of African-born black women was 3333 g, and that of 43,322 infants of U.S.-born black women was 3089 g. The incidence of low birth weight (weight less than 2500 g) was 13.2 percent among infants of U.S.-born black women and 7.1 percent among infants of African-born black women, as compared with 4.3 percent among infants of U.S.- born white women (relative risks, 3.1 and 1.6, respectively). Among the women at lowest risk (those 20 to 39 years old, with 12 years of education for themselves and their spouses, early prenatal care, gravida 2 or 3, and no previous fetal loss), the rate of low birth weight in infants of African-born black women (3.6 percent) was closer to the rate in infants of U.S.- born white women (2.4 percent), and the rate in infants of U.S.-born black women remained high (7.5 percent).

Conclusions The birth-weight patterns of infants of African-born black women and U.S.-born white women are more closely related to one another than to the birth weights of infants of U.S.-born black women.

Objective To evaluate vitamin D inadequacy among extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW, <1000 g) infants and the association between circulating vitamin D concentrations and perinatal-neonatal outcomes.

Study design Prospective cohort study of ELBW infants in the neonatal ICU. Blood was collected within the first 3 days after birth after obtaining informed consent. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D) were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and classified as vitamin D deficient, insufficient, or adequate (< 20, 20-30, or > 30ng/mL, respectively). Associations between 25(OH)D and perinatal-neonatal outcomes were determined by multivariable regression, adjusted for covariates that differ in the bivariate analysis.

Results Of the 60 ELBW infants enrolled, 13 (22%) were vitamin D deficient, 15 (25%) were insufficient, and 32 (53%) were adequate. 25(OH)D levels were positively associated with fetal growth restriction and prolonged rupture of the membranes.

Conclusions Vitamin D inadequacy was frequent among ELBW infants. Circulating vitamin D concentrations were significantly associated with perinatal outcomes in this contemporary cohort.
