 **A few general benefits of vitamin D:** 

• It’s antimicrobial

• It helps regulate the immune system

• It’s anti-inflammatory 

• It supports the smooth muscle of your lungs to help you breathe better 

There is a condition called polymorphism, where your  **vitamin D receptors**  don’t receive vitamin D as they should. If you’re not seeing the benefits you think you should expect from vitamin D, it may be because of this condition. 

In this situation, increasing the amount of vitamin D you take may be beneficial. Infrared light therapy also has some interesting benefits for the lungs. 

Potential benefits of infrared light therapy:

• It may help inhibit bronchoconstriction and help you breathe better

• It’s a potent anti-inflammatory 

• It may help decrease fibrosis in COPD

• It may help reduce pollution in the air

Then, we have UV light. UV light can help kill germs and decrease pathogens in the air that could otherwise overload the immune system. 

 **The best remedy to support and protect lung health is <span style="color:#F00;">the sun</span>** . The sun gives you UV light, UVB light (which helps increase vitamin D), and infrared light. 

The sun has a direct effect on your lungs, inflammation, and your immune system. It also helps stimulate melatonin, which acts as a powerful antioxidant and may help decrease coughing.
