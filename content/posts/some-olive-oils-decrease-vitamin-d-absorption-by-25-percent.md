 **There had been many indications that some Vitamin D supplements using olive oil were not as as good as supplements.  This may be the reason why – some have more Pinoresinol.  Not all olive oil is the same. Until we find out otherwise, I would suggest not supplementing with Vitamin D which is in olive oil,**  I think that I will also avoid having vitamin D supplements with olive oil salads

 **Highlights** 

•We examined the effect of olive oil polyphenols on vitamin D absorption.

•Olive oil polyphenols could inhibit vitamin D absorption in rats.

•Pinoresinol inhibited vitamin D uptake in Caco-2 cells.

Enriching oils, such as olive oil, could be one solution to tackle the worldwide epidemic of vitamin D deficiency and to better fit with omega 3 (DHA) recommendations. However, data regarding the interactions occurring at the intestinal level between vitamin D and phenols from olive oil are scarce. We first determined the effect of polyphenols from a virgin olive oil, and a virgin olive oil enriched with DHA, on vitamin D absorption in rats. We then investigated the effects of 3 main olive oil phenols (oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and pinoresinol) on vitamin D uptake by Caco-2 cells. The presence of polyphenols in the olive oil supplemented with DHA, inhibited vitamin D postprandial response in rats  **(-25%, p<0.05).**  Similar results were obtained with a mix of the 3 polyphenols delivered to Caco-2 cells. However, this inhibitory effect was due to the presence of pinoresinol only. As the  **pinoresinol content can highly vary between olive oils** , the present results should be taken into account to formulate an appropriate oil product enriched in vitamin D.
