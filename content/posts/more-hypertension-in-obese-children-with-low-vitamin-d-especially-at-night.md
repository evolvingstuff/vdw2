## Hypovitaminosis D and nocturnal hypertension in obese children: an interesting link.

J Hum Hypertens. 2013 Dec 5. [doi: 10.1038/jhh.2013.122.](https://doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2013.122.)

In adults, low levels of vitamin D are associated with hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 24-h blood pressure (BP) patterns and vitamin D levels in obese children. We recorded anthropometric parameters, took blood samples for 25-hydroxivitamin D measurements and monitored  **ambulatory BP (ABP)**  in 32 obese children (male/female: 21/11, age 7-16 years). 

Subjects in the lower tertiles had 

* higher homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, 

* nighttime systolic and diastolic ABP, 

* nighttime systolic and diastolic ABP load, 

* 24-h ABP index and nighttime systolic and 

* diastolic ABP index than those in the higher tertile. 

Vitamin D correlated negatively with 

* 24-h and nighttime systolic ABP, 

* 24-h systolic ABP load, 

* nighttime systolic and diastolic ABP load, 

* 24-h systolic ABP index and nighttime systolic ABP index. 

The percentage of subjects with pathological 24-h systolic BP (SBP) load, nighttime SBP load, nighttime diastolic BP (DBP) load, nighttime SBP index and nighttime DBP index increased progressively as the vitamin deficiency categories increased (χ2=10.26, P<0.05; χ2=16.34, P<0.01; χ2=10.23, P<0.05; χ2=10.38 and χ2=10.06, P <0.01).  **Low levels of vitamin D in obese children were associated with a higher BP burden, especially at night.**

---

#### Wonder why there is more beneft from higher vitamin D at night.

#### Wonder if there is a similar benefit to obese adults

#### Wonder if this is the reason that vitamin D helps reduce COPD in adults (at night)
