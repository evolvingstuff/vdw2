#### Evidence of low vitamin D intakes in the Australian population points to a need for data-driven nutrition policy for improving population vitamin D status

Background: Nearly one in four Australian adults are vitamin D deficient (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D) <50 nmol/L) and current vitamin D intakes in the Australian population are unknown. Internationally, vitamin D intakes are commonly below recommendations, although estimates generally rely on food composition data that do not include 25(OH)D.

Objective: We aimed to estimate usual vitamin D intakes in the Australian population.

Design: Nationally-representative food consumption data were collected for Australians aged ≥2 years (n=12,153) as part of the cross-sectional 2011-2013 Australian Health Survey (AHS). New analytical vitamin D food composition data for vitamin D3 , 25(OH)D3 , vitamin D2 and 25(OH)D2 were mapped to foods and beverages that were commonly consumed by AHS participants. Usual vitamin D intakes (µg/day) by sex and age group were estimated using the National Cancer Institute method.

Results: Assuming a 25(OH)D bioactivity factor of one, mean daily intakes of vitamin D ranged between 1.84 and 3.25 µg/day. Compared to the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) of 10 µg/day recommended by the Institute of Medicine,  **more than 95% of people had inadequate vitamin D intakes** . We estimated that no participant exceeded the Institute of Medicine's Upper Level of Intake (63-100 µg/day, depending on age group).

Conclusions: Usual vitamin D intakes in Australia are low. This evidence, paired with the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Australia, suggests that data-driven nutrition policy is required to safely increase dietary intakes of vitamin D and improve vitamin D status at the population level.
