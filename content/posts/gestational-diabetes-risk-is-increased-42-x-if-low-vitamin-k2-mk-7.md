#### Effects of serum vitamin K levels in early pregnancy on pregnancy-related diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes

Wei Sheng Yan Jiu . 2025 Jan;54(1):87-91  **Article is in Chinese**  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39943654/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39943654/)

Objective: To explore the relationship between vitamin K levels and pregnancy-related diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes in early pregnancy.

Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to select 367 women in early pregnancy who were enrolled in the Shunyi Women&apos;s and Children&apos;s Hospital of Beijing Children&apos;s Hospital from October 2018 to September 2019. Basic information such as age, height, and pre-pregnancy weight of the respondents was collected, blood samples were taken and the concentration of vitamin K(vitamin K1, MK-4 and MK-7) was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS). Follow-up visits were conducted to collect information on whether the respondents had pregnancy-related disease and their pregnancy outcomes. The relationship between vitamin K concentration and pregnancy-related diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes was analyzed by partial correlation test and binary logistic regression.

Results: The mean age of the respondents was 29.3 years, with a range of pre-pregnancy body mass index from 15.43 to 40.40 and weeks of pregnancy range from 5.9 to 14.0 weeks. The concentrations of MK-7, vitamin K1, and MK-4 in pregnant women(M(P25, P75))were 1.093(0.295, 3.325)ng/mL, 0.526(0.359, 0.681)ng/mL and 0.021(0.018, 0.026)ng/mL, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between serum MK-7 levels in early pregnancy and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM)(P=0.032). 

The result of binary logistic regression analysis showed that MK-7 deficiency was a risk factor for GDM( **OR=4.276** , P=0.034) after adjusting for confounding factors: age, ethnicity, BMI, parity, vitamin D level, physical activity, low-density lipoprotein(LDL), high-density lipoprotein(HDL), and gestational age.

Conclusion: Serum MK-7 levels in early pregnancy are negatively associated with the development of GDM in women. It is therefore essential to pay more attention to the nutritional status of vitamin K in pregnant women in early pregnancy.

Objective: To explore the relationship between vitamin K levels and pregnancy-related diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes in early pregnancy.

Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to select 367 women in early pregnancy who were enrolled in the Shunyi Women&amp;apos;s and Children&amp;apos;s Hospital of Beijing Children&amp;apos;s Hospital from October 2018 to September 2019. Basic information such as age, height, and pre-pregnancy weight of the respondents was collected, blood samples were taken and the concentration of vitamin K(vitamin K1, MK-4 and MK-7) was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS). Follow-up visits were conducted to collect information on whether the respondents had pregnancy-related disease and their pregnancy outcomes. The relationship between vitamin K concentration and pregnancy-related diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes was analyzed by partial correlation test and binary logistic regression.

Results: The mean age of the respondents was 29.3 years, with a range of pre-pregnancy body mass index from 15.43 to 40.40 and weeks of pregnancy range from 5.9 to 14.0 weeks. The concentrations of MK-7, vitamin K1, and MK-4 in pregnant women(M(P25, P75))were 1.093(0.295, 3.325)ng/mL, 0.526(0.359, 0.681)ng/mL and 0.021(0.018, 0.026)ng/mL, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between serum MK-7 levels in early pregnancy and the development of gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM)(P=0.032). 
The result of binary logistic regression analysis showed that MK-7 deficiency was a risk factor for GDM(__OR=4.276__, P=0.034) after adjusting for confounding factors: age, ethnicity, BMI, parity, vitamin D level, physical activity, low-density lipoprotein(LDL), high-density lipoprotein(HDL), and gestational age.

Conclusion: Serum MK-7 levels in early pregnancy are negatively associated with the development of GDM in women. It is therefore essential to pay more attention to the nutritional status of vitamin K in pregnant women in early pregnancy.
