 **Highlights** 

* Serum cholecalciferol and 25(OH)D3 increased after UVB irradiation of 3 different anatomic sites in the same individuals.

* UVB exposure of a larger skin area resulted in greater increases in serum cholecalciferol concentrations.

* Sporadic exposure of only face and hands was capable of a significant rise in serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3.

Background

Cholecalciferol is an essential steroid produced in the skin by solar ultraviolet B radiation (UVB 290-315 nm). 

Skin production of cholecalciferol depends on factors affecting UVB flux, age and exposed skin area.

Purpose

Serum cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 <span>[25(OH)D3]</span> concentrations were measured after UVB irradiation of 3 different skin areas to compare the skin capacity to produce vitamin D in different anatomic sites in the same individuals.

Method

Ten voluntary Caucasians (skin photo type II & III, aged 48±12 years, (±SD)) were exposed to broadband UVB (280-320 nm) between February and April. Hands and face, upper body and whole body were exposed to a suberythemic dose of UVB (median 101 mJ/cm2, (min 66, max 143)) (for 3 subsequent days 24 h apart with a wash out period of about 3 weeks (median 18 days, (min 11, max 25)) between the exposures of respective area. Serum concentrations of cholecalciferol and 25(OH)D3, were measured immediately before the first and 24 h after the last dose of radiation.

Results

There was a significantly higher increase in serum cholecalciferol after UVB exposure of the two larger skin areas compared to face and hands, but  **no difference in increase was found between upper body and whole body exposures** .

Conclusion

Exposure of a larger skin area was superior to small areas and gave greater increase in both serum cholecalciferol and serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations. However, exposure of face and hands, i.e. only 5% of the body surface area, was capable of increasing serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3.

### VitaminDWiki got a chance to look at the study

The cholecalciferol increase was about 15 ng average for

1. Just upper body exposed to UVB

1. Entire body (nude) exposed to UVB

> Virtually all of the literature assumes that the vitamin D generated is proportional to skin exposed,so doubling the skin area should double the vitamin D produced.

* Note: It is possible that the lower portion of the body was not used to being exposed to sunshine/uvb so would not have much pre-vitamin D in the skin. 

* Would be interesting to have a follow-on experiments where:  

1. Subjects are used to having their legs exposed to sunshine.

1. Just the lower half is exposed, rather than the upper half of the body

> Wonder how long it takes for pre-vitamin D production to increase in a portion of skin: days, weeks, seasons, lifetimes ? ?
