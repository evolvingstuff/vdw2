* "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires first-class airline pilots to receive an electrocardiogram (EKG) starting at age 35, and continuing annually after age 40"

* "An estimated 20% of pilots screened may have suffered heart damage due to COVID-19 shots, and the FAA may have been forced to widen the EKG parameters so pilots could continue to fly"

* "On an EKG, a normal PR interval measures 0.12 to 0.2 seconds."

* On Oct 24, 2022 the FAA increased the grounding criteria from 0.2 seconds to 0.3 seconds
