#### What % of people dislike swallowing pills and why – Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024

According to the search results, a significant percentage of people dislike or have difficulty swallowing pills:

* A nationwide survey found that 40% of American adults have experienced difficulty swallowing pills, 

> &nbsp; even though they do not have issues swallowing food or liquids.

* One in three people (33%) will vomit, choke, or gag when swallowing pills.

* Research shows that 30% of people dislike or have trouble swallowing pills.

There are several reasons why people may dislike or have difficulty swallowing pills:

 **Physical Causes** 

* A hypersensitive gag reflex (also known as a laryngeal spasm)

* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - acid backing up into the esophagus may cause damage leading to spasms or narrowing

* Scleroderma - scar-like tissue buildup that can weaken the lower esophageal ring

* Radiation therapy - head and neck cancer treatment can cause swallowing disorders even years later

* Dry mouth

* Temporary conditions like taking antibiotics or undergoing chemotherapy

 **Psychological Causes** 

* Emotional or anxiety issues, often stemming from a past negative experience

* Aversion to the taste of pills, as many have an unpleasant coating

* Fear of choking

 **Other Factors** 

* Pill characteristics like size, shape, color and texture can impact swallowability

* There appears to be an association between younger age, female gender, poor mental health status and pill aversion

In summary, around 30-40% of people report disliking or having trouble swallowing pills due to a variety of physical, psychological and pill-related factors. This is a significant issue that can impact medication adherence and health outcomes if not properly addressed.

!!!!What % of people dislike swallowing pills and why – Asked Perplexity AI Aug 2024
According to the search results, a significant percentage of people dislike or have difficulty swallowing pills:
*A nationwide survey found that 40% of American adults have experienced difficulty swallowing pills, 
+ ~hs~ even though they do not have issues swallowing food or liquids.
*One in three people (33%) will vomit, choke, or gag when swallowing pills.
*Research shows that 30% of people dislike or have trouble swallowing pills.
There are several reasons why people may dislike or have difficulty swallowing pills:
__Physical Causes__
*A hypersensitive gag reflex (also known as a laryngeal spasm)
*Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - acid backing up into the esophagus may cause damage leading to spasms or narrowing
*Scleroderma - scar-like tissue buildup that can weaken the lower esophageal ring
*Radiation therapy - head and neck cancer treatment can cause swallowing disorders even years later
*Dry mouth
*Temporary conditions like taking antibiotics or undergoing chemotherapy
__Psychological Causes__
*Emotional or anxiety issues, often stemming from a past negative experience
*Aversion to the taste of pills, as many have an unpleasant coating
*Fear of choking
__Other Factors__
*Pill characteristics like size, shape, color and texture can impact swallowability
*There appears to be an association between younger age, female gender, poor mental health status and pill aversion
In summary, around 30-40% of people report disliking or having trouble swallowing pills due to a variety of physical, psychological and pill-related factors. This is a significant issue that can impact medication adherence and health outcomes if not properly addressed.
