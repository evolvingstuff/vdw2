* Both arms of the RCT got 400 IU daily

* Vitamin D levels were measured 8 to 12 weeks after the start of the trial

* No indication why they stopped the Vitamin D supplementation at 8 weeks

> As would be expected the vitamin D levels dropped a lot after the supplementation stopped

* Average level achieved at 8 weeks was 48 nanograms

* Some got above 70 nanograms

> This is probably due to taking the vitamin D sample within a few days of the last 50,000 IU dose

* 2 had their vitamin D levels drop

* 84% became vitamin D sufficient  at 8 weeks (> 30 ng)

* No indication that they recorded  the outcome differences between the RCT ARMS
