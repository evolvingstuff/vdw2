OBJECTIVE: Recent data suggest vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is associated with  **bacterial vaginosis**  (BV) during pregnancy. 

We hypothesized that VDD is a risk factor for BV in nonpregnant women.

STUDY DESIGN: Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses stratified by pregnancy.

RESULTS: VDD was associated with BV only in pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio <span>[AOR]</span>, 2.87; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 1.13-7.28). 

Among nonpregnant women, 

douching (AOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.25-2.37), 

smoking (AOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.23-2.24), and 

black race (AOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.67-3.47) were associated with BV; 

oral contraceptive use was inversely associated with BV (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.90). 

VDD moderated the association between smoking and BV in nonpregnant women.

CONCLUSION: Risk factors for BV differ by pregnancy status. 

VDD was a modifiable risk factor for BV among pregnant women; evaluation of vitamin D supplementation for prevention or adjunct therapy of BV in pregnancy is warranted.
