#### [Vitamin D Council](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/health-conditions/autism/)

* “I have treated around 200 autistic children with high-dose vitamin D and about two-thirds respond, often dramatically. “

* “The dose ranges from 300 to 500 IU/kg/day.”

> “ These doses require monitoring of vitamin D levels <span>[25(OH)D]</span> to ensure they are less than 120 ng/ml but higher than 80 ng/nl.”
