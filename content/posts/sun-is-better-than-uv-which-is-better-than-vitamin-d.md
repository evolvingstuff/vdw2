### Sun is the best

* Vitamin D levels produced by the sun [last longer](/posts/half-life-of-vitamin-d-varies) than those produced by supplements

* Benefits to [Multiple Sclerosis from Sun](/posts/hypothesis-more-in-sunshine-than-vitamin-d-to-reduce-ms) produced vitamin D are much better than those from supplements

* Sun also produces Nitric Oxide that helps many health problems - such as [cardiovascular](/posts/nitric-oxide-from-sun-uva-vitamin-d-reduces-cardiovascular-problems)

* [UVB produced 8X more vitamin D as solar UV – July 2012](/posts/uvb-produced-8x-more-vitamin-d-as-solar-uv) perhaps UV source is better if it has very little UVA

#### Start gradually with the sun/uv and minimize  getting even a slight reddening of the skin the next day

* The sun only produces a useful amount of vitamin D when your shadow is shorter than you are.

* Might start the season with just a few minutes of noonday sun

* The more skin exposed, the more vitamin D you will get for the same amount of sun/uv time

* As vitamin D levels build up you are able to handle more time in the sun/uv without reddening
