**Although researchers, physicians, and clinical nutritionists can't agree completely on dose rates, recommended blood levels, and expected clinical outcomes, there is no question that vitamin D status plays an important role in reducing, preventing, and in some cases, treating a wide range of chronic degenerative medical conditions.  The purpose of the VitaminDWiki is to provide a convenient, comprehensive, and authoritative resource to investigate how optimizing vitamin D status may be helpful for you or someone you care about. It's a big subject so we urge you to spend some time exploring and learning about this important nutrient.**
