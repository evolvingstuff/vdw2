**From the web** 

* “The poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma subtype is characterized by its non-secretory, aggressive behavior and frequently grows in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts <sup>[1]</sup>. The median survival of patients with this disease who have distant metastases is about five months.”

* “As a rule, an undifferentiated cancer is more malignant than a cancer of that type which is well differentiated.”
