The PDF defines supplemementation as > 80 IU of vitamin D

It is rare for prenatal vitamins to have as much as 400 IU of vitamin D

BACKGROUND:

Sweden has the second highest incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world. Nutritional aspects in utero and in infancy affect the development. We conducted a survey to determine whether reported maternal use of vitamin D-containing micronutrient supplements during pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing type 1 diabetes in the child.

METHODS:

This report was based on data from the ABIS (All Babies In Southeast Sweden) study, with questionnaire data on 16 339 mother and infant pairs at birth and at 1-yr of age (n = 10 879), of whom 108 children were registered with type 1 diabetes before 14-16 yr of age. The questions 'during pregnancy, did you take any vitamin/mineral supplements?' and 'if yes, which? (open answer)' in addition to other lifestyle questions were answered. Logistic regression was performed with onset of type 1 diabetes as the dependent variable and vitamin D supplementation use as the independent variable, adjusted for relevant factors.

RESULTS:

Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy was consumed by 9.3% of mothers whose children later got type1 diabetes and among 11.3% of those mothers whose children did not get type 1 diabetes (p = 0.532). No significant association was found between reported supplement intake of vitamin D during pregnancy and risk of type 1 diabetes, even when adjusting for factors which could influence the association.

CONCLUSION:

Maternal use of vitamin D-containing multivitamin supplements during pregnancy was not related to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes in children before 14-16 yr of age in Southeast of Sweden.
