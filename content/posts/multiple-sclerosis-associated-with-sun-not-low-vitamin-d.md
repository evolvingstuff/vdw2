PURPOSE: To assess the relationships of sun exposure history, supplementation and environmental factors to vitamin D levels in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to evaluate the associations between sun exposure and MRI measures.

METHODS: This study included 264 MS patients (mean age 46.9±10 years, disease duration 14.6±10 years; 67.8% relapsing-remitting, 28% secondary progressive and 4.2% primary progressive MS) and 69 healthy controls. Subjects underwent neurological and 3 T MRI examinations, provided blood samples and answered questions to a structured questionnaire. Information on race, skin and eye colour, supplement use, body mass index (BMI) and sun exposure was obtained by questionnaire. The vitamin D metabolites (25-hydroxy vitamin D3, 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 and 24, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3) were measured using mass spectrometry.

RESULTS: 

* Multivitamin supplementation (partial correlation r(p)=0.29, p<0.001), 

* BMI (r(p)=-0.24, p=0.001),

* summer sun exposure (r(p)=0.22, p=0.002) and 

* darker eye colour (r(p)=-0.18, p=0.015) 

had the strongest associations with vitamin D metabolite levels in the MS group. 

Increased summer sun exposure was associated with 

* increased grey matter volume (GMV, r(p)=0.16, p=0.019) and 

* whole brain volume (WBV, r(p)=0.20, p=0.004) 

after correcting for Extended Disability Status Scale in the MS group. 

Inclusion of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels did not substantially affect the positive associations of sun exposure with 

* WBV (r(p)=0.18, p=0.003) and 

* GMV (r(p)=0.14, p=0.026) in the MS group.

CONCLUSIONS: Sun exposure may have direct effects on MRI measures of neurodegeneration in MS, independently of vitamin D.

## Comment by VitaminDWiki

This agrees with many previous studies which indicate that net UV may be more important than vitamin D.

However, notice that this study compares measured vitamin D levels with recalled amount of time out in the sun (for how many years)

Rather inprecise
