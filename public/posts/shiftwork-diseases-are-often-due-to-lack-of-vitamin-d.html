In particular, there has been a recent flourish in investigating potential cancer risk associated with working night shifts and other shift schedules. Epidemiologic studies have revealed generally weak associations due to several methodological challenges such as lack of standard classifications of shift or night work. The field also has been hindered by a lack of clarity about the possible mechanisms by which shiftwork could have an effect on cancer risk.</p><p>One possible mechanism is reduced production of melatonin caused by exposure to light at night. Although there is a growing body of evidence that provides some support for this mechanism, several other mechanisms also make sense from a biological point of view.</p><p>Further, the relatively weak magnitude of the associations between light at night and melatonin level suggests that multiple factors may be operating along the pathway between shift work and adverse health consequences (including cancer risk).</p><p>Here we propose four additional mechanisms that should be considered for a comprehensive investigation of these potential pathways.</p><p>These are:</p><ul><li><p>phase shift;</p></li><li><p>sleep disruption;</p></li><li><p>lifestyle factors (such as poor quality diets, less physical activity and higher BMI); and</p></li><li><p>lower vitamin D.</p></li></ul><p>Consideration of all these mechanisms is necessary in order to design effective preventative workplace strategies. In developed countries, approximately 20% of the population undertake shiftwork and, while we are unlikely to be able to eliminate shiftwork from current work practices, there are aspects of shiftwork that can be modified and there may be facets of individual susceptibility that we may be able to identify and target for prevention.</p><p>PMID: 21723672</p><hr><h4 id=adverse-metabolic-consequences-in-humans-of-prolonged-sleep-restriction-combined-with-circadian-disruption>Adverse Metabolic Consequences in Humans of Prolonged Sleep Restriction Combined with Circadian Disruption</h4><p>Sci Transl Med 11 April 2012: ; Vol. 4, Issue 129, p. 129ra43</p><p>Sci.

We tested the hypotheses that prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, as can occur in people performing shift work, impairs glucose regulation and metabolism. Healthy adults spent >5 weeks under controlled laboratory conditions in which they experienced an initial baseline segment of optimal sleep, 3 weeks of sleep restriction (5.6 hours of sleep per 24 hours) combined with circadian disruption (recurring 28-hour “days”), followed by 9 days of recovery sleep with circadian re-entrainment. Exposure to prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption, with measurements taken at the same circadian phase, decreased the participants’ resting metabolic rate and increased plasma glucose concentrations after a meal, an effect resulting from inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion. These parameters normalized during the 9 days of recovery sleep and stable circadian re-entrainment. Thus, in humans, prolonged sleep restriction with concurrent circadian disruption alters metabolism and could increase the risk of obesity and diabetes.</p><p>Copyright © 2012, American Association for the Advancement of Science</p><hr><h4 id=article-in-kurzweilainet-which-read-the-above-study-and-reported-on-ithttpwwwkurzweilainetthe-dark-side-of-working-nights><a href=http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-dark-side-of-working-nights>Article in Kurzweilai.net which read the above study and reported on it</a></h4><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>A growing body of epidemiological data that indicates shift workers are at an increased risk of</p><ul><li><p>weight gain,</p></li><li><p>metabolic abnormalities,</p></li><li><p>heart disease,</p></li><li><p>diabetes, and</p></li><li><p>obesity, among other disorders.</p></li></ul><p>In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) even classified shift work as a <strong>probable carcinogen</strong> , due to accumulating evidence that disruptions to the circadian rhythm increased the risk of developing certain cancers.</p><hr><p><strong><span style=color:red>It is interesting that every one of these diseases also are associated with having a low level of the sunshine vitamin</span></strong></p><hr><h4 id=the-following-found-no-association-of-low-vitamin-d-in-a-few-shift-workers-where-their-shifts-were-constantly-rotating-thus-having-access-to-middle-of-the-day-sunshine-many-times-per-month>The following found NO association of low vitamin D in a few shift workers where their shifts were constantly rotating thus having access to middle-of-the-day sunshine many times per month</h4><p><strong>Association between night-shift work and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in Japanese male indoor workers: a cross-sectional study</strong></p><p>Ind Health. 2011;49(5):658-62.

Here, we examined serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in 19 Japanese indoor workers, including night-shift workers, in blood samples collected at the annual medical checkup (late July) in a metal tool factory. Analyses were finally restricted to 14 male workers (33-59 yr) in 3 groups: fixed daytime work (n=6), and rotating shift work with (n=4) and without (n=4) night shifts. No significant differences in serum 25OHD levels were observed among the three groups (p=0.98, Kruskal-Wallis test). One to two participants in each group had 25OHD levels lower than the 20 ng/ml reference value for vitamin D deficiency even in summer. These results clearly indicate the need for large-scale studies to test the hypothesis that night-shift work is associated with lower 25OHD levels.</p><p>PMID: 21804263 <a href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21804263>CLICK HERE</a> for full text on-line</p></article></div></div><script src="/js/lightspa.js?v=1749775588"></script><script>const spa=new LightSPA({mainContentSelector:'[role="main"]',navigationSelector:"[data-spa-nav]"});window.search=new Search({documentsUrl:"/search/search_documents.json.gz?v=1749775588",indexUrl:"/search/search_index.json.gz?v=1749775588"}),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){function e(e){var t=e.querySelector(".category-expander"),n=e.querySelector(".subcategory-list");e.classList.contains("collapsed")?(e.classList.remove("collapsed"),e.classList.add("expanded"),t.textContent="-",n.style.display="block"):(e.classList.remove("expanded"),e.classList.add("collapsed"),t.textContent="+",n.style.display="none")}document.querySelectorAll(".category-expander").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})}),document.querySelectorAll(".category-name").forEach(function(t){t.addEventListener("click",function(t){t.stopPropagation();var n=this.closest(".top-level-category");e(n)})})})</script><script src="/js/toc-sanitizer.js?v=1749775588"></script><script src="/js/tiki-redirects.js?v=1749775588"></script></body></html>
