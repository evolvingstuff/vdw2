#### Rise in Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels during the COVID-19 Pandemic

Nutrients. 2024 Jul 27;16(15):2449. [doi: 10.3390/nu16152449.](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16152449.)

With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of established evidence-based treatment protocols led healthcare professionals and the public to explore experimental treatments, including high doses of vitamin D supplements. This study aimed to assess changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels during the pandemic, employing a retrospective cohort analysis of data from Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC). The study analyzed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a cohort of 35,556 patients treated at CAMC in 2019, a representative pre-pandemic period, to 2021, a representative pandemic period. Our findings revealed a significant increase in mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as compared with 2019 (37 ± 21 vs. 31 ± 15 ng/mL, p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, in 2021, there were significantly more patients exhibiting serum levels in the highest quintiles, specifically 

* >100 ng/mL (1.6% vs. 0.2%), 

* 75-100 ng/mL (4.6% vs. 1.2%), and 

* 50-75 ng/mL (16.0% vs. 8.4%), p ≤ 0.001. 

This upsurge suggests increased intake of vitamin D supplements, potentially fueled by widespread discussions that were taking place largely on the internet regarding the efficacy of vitamin D against COVID-19. Our findings underscore the critical need for evidence-based public health messaging, especially during health crises, to prevent unnecessary health risks and ensure patient safety.

With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of established evidence-based treatment protocols led healthcare professionals and the public to explore experimental treatments, including high doses of vitamin D supplements. This study aimed to assess changes in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels during the pandemic, employing a retrospective cohort analysis of data from Charleston Area Medical Center (CAMC). The study analyzed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in a cohort of 35,556 patients treated at CAMC in 2019, a representative pre-pandemic period, to 2021, a representative pandemic period. Our findings revealed a significant increase in mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels as compared with 2019 (37 ± 21 vs. 31 ± 15 ng/mL, p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, in 2021, there were significantly more patients exhibiting serum levels in the highest quintiles, specifically 
*&gt;100 ng/mL (1.6% vs. 0.2%), 
*75-100 ng/mL (4.6% vs. 1.2%), and 
*50-75 ng/mL (16.0% vs. 8.4%), p ≤ 0.001. 
This upsurge suggests increased intake of vitamin D supplements, potentially fueled by widespread discussions that were taking place largely on the internet regarding the efficacy of vitamin D against COVID-19. Our findings underscore the critical need for evidence-based public health messaging, especially during health crises, to prevent unnecessary health risks and ensure patient safety.
