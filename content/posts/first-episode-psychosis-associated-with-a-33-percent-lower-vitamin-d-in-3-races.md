## Vitamin D deficiency in first episode psychosis: A case-control study.

Schizophr Res. 2013 Sep 20. pii: S0920-9964(13)00472-6. [doi: 10.1016/j.schres.2013.08.036.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2013.08.036.)

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is seen in a high proportion of people with established psychotic disorders, but it is not known if this is present at onset of the illness. We set out to examine vitamin D levels in people with their first episode of psychosis (FEP).

METHOD: We conducted a matched case-control study to examine vitamin D levels and rates of vitamin D deficiency in sixty nine patients presenting with their FEP and sixty nine controls matched for age, sex and ethnicity. Differences between groups were tested using student's-t tests, paired t-tests and odds ratios for further analysis.

RESULTS: Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in cases than in controls (p<0.001). The odds ratio of being vitamin D deficient was 2.99 in the FEP group relative to the control group. There was no correlation between vitamin D levels and length of hospitalisation in the patient group (r=-0.027, p=0.827).

CONCLUSIONS: We found higher rates of vitamin D deficiency in people with FEP compared to matched controls. Given that vitamin D is neuroprotective; that developmental vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for psychosis, and that incipient psychosis may affect lifestyle factors and diet, future studies are required to examine this association further. In the meantime, there is a need for more widespread testing of vitamin D levels in FEP and for the development of appropriate management strategies.

 **They note 3 possible causes for the association:** 

1. During the often long prodromal phase, many patients with schizophrenia withdraw from normal activities, and this might result in a reduction in sunlight exposure.

1. Having low levels of vitamin D over a long period may be a risk factor for developing psychosis.

1. Because vitamin D is a negative acute-phase reactant, levels can decrease during an inflammatory response.

> Comment on MedScape: My clinical experience shows that "sick" patients require  a lot more vit D3 supplements  than usual and than  healthier patients to maintain the same blood levels .  It seems that the active phases of illness consume this vitamin  in a fashion similar to how patients with colds can tolerate higher levels of vitamin C supplementation before they get loose stools when compared to their tolerated level when healthy.
