In most fish oils, the amount of these other fatty acids is low, but in highly concentrated oils, it can be a significant amount. The important components are EPA and DHA.</p><p>SOURCE OF OMEGA-3 OIL FOUND IN OMEGA XL: Omega XL is produced by the Great Health Works Company of Coral Springs, Florida. Unlike the omega-3 found in fish oil products, which is derived from cold water fish such as anchovies, sardines, mackerel, herring, pollock, and whiting, the omega-3 and other fatty acids found in Omega XL are derived from the green-lipped mussel found in New Zealand.</p><p>LARRY KING INFOMERCIAL: I became aware of Omega XL while watching the Larry King infomercial about this product and decided to look into some of the claims. My first reaction was: what does Larry King know about fatty acid supplements?; why is the company using him as a spokesperson?; how much are they paying him?; and what effect has his engagement as spokesperson had on the exorbitant price of this product? Suffice it to say that Mr. King&rsquo;s opinion of Omega XL and my opinion of Omega XL are very different!</p><p>BREAKDOWN: Here is a breakdown of these supplements.</p><nav

The reports include a 5-star rating for each product containing greater than 60% concentration of EPA and DHA per gram of fish oil, allowing consumers to compare fish oil products based on their safety, purity and quality. Some of this testing now includes radiation testing as a result of the Japanese Fukushima accident. Most of the highly rated omega-3 fish oil products are listed. Omega XL is not listed or rated because it is not a fish oil. So, we don&rsquo;t have an independent third-party testing organization&rsquo;s evaluation of the product.</p><p>SUPERCRITICAL DUAL-PROCESS CO2 TECHNOLOGY: Omega XL, OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula, Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega, and UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 are not molecularly distilled. They use a proprietary Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 Technology which concentrates omega-3s, yielding unique selectivity of one of the most biologically active omega-3 fatty acids - EPA. Using less heat, less repeat processing, and natural carbon dioxide as a solvent, allows these products to reach peak concentrations approximating 100% EPA, omitting superfluous fats and fillers. 400% less heat than molecular distillation is used during the entire process, with no oxygen exposure. Natural CO2 is used as an alternative to organic solvents and protects the final product from oxidation. In my opinion, Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 Technology is superior to molecular distillation.</p><p>LABEL DESCRIPTION: The label on the Omega XL product is one of the most poorly constructed I have seen on the bottle of any supplement. It omits most important information about the product; it fails to list the ingredients; it fails to break down its fatty acid content in terms of EPA, DHA, and other omega-3; it fails to list the size of the gel cap; and it fails to list the overall content of each gel cap. None of the important information about the product is centralized and set forth in one place. You have to ferret it out, to the extent you can. This is not the kind of transparency one would expect from a reputable neutraceutical company.</p><p>FATTY ACID CONTENT: Omega XL distinguishes itself from omega-3 fish oil products by claiming that it contains thirty different fatty acids to only two or three contained in omega-3 fish oils, and it is more bio-available than omega-3 fish oil. This claim is false and misleading. It claims that each capsule contains 150 mgs of &ldquo;fatty acids,&rdquo; 11 mgs of which are EPA and 6 mgs of which are DHA. The thirty fatty acids contained in each capsule are: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), Palmitic acid, Palmitoleic acid, Stearic acid, Vaccenic acid, Linoleic acid (an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid), Linoelaidic acid (an omega-6 trans fatty acid), Oleic acid (an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid), Nervonic acid (an omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acid), Arachidonic acid (AA), Docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), Heptadecanoic acid, Eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA), Arachidic acid, Elaidic acid, Linolenic acid (GLA), Gadoleic acid, Eicosadienoic acid (EDA), Behenic acid, Tricosanoic acid, Butyric acid, Caprylic acid, Capric acid, Undecanoic acid, Lauric acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and Myristic acid.</p><p>There is nothing novel or unique about Omega XL&rsquo;s claim of thirty fatty acids. A low potency omega-3 fish oil product contains a similar amount of fatty acids. What is significant is that only some of those fatty acids are helpful, while others are either neutral or not beneficial. Omega XL does not clearly identify which are which. In fact, OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil, which is a high potency omega-3 fish oil, contains about twenty fatty acids. Some of those fatty acids are present as trace elements. Bottom line, more fatty acids are not necessarily better! This is a deceptive and misleading sales pitch by Omega XL &mldr; nothing more. It lacks transparency!</p><p>Other than EPA and DHA, the precise amounts of the thirty or so fatty acids contained in Omega XL are not disclosed, nor are they proven to have any real benefits. Some, like omega-6 and omega-9, which appear to be present in Omega XL in abundance, are clearly not beneficial. In fact, some appear to be trans fats. Palmitic acid is a potential heart problem. It is found as a &ldquo;contaminant&rdquo; in Seabuckthorn Omega-7 oils. Arachidonic acid is highly inflammatory and is the by-product of Omega-6 metabolism.</p><p>OMEGA-3 POTENCY: UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 (91%) has the highest omega-3 potency of those in the comparison; followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (89%); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (85%), Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (85%); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (77%); followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 (75%) and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 (75%); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (72%); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (64%); and followed by Omega XL (11%), which has by far the lowest omega-3 potency of those in the comparison. Omega XL has the lowest omega-3 potency of any omega-3 product I have reviewed.</p><p>PRICE PER PILL: Omega XL ($1.50 per gel cap) is the most expensive per pill of those in the comparison; followed by UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 ($.73 per gel cap); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.62 per gel cap) and Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.64 per gel cap); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.48 per gel cap); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.33 per gel cap); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.25 per gel cap); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.21 per gel cap); followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.15 per gel cap); and followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.13 per gel cap), which is the least expensive per pill of those in the comparison.</p><p>PRICE PER 1000 MGS OMEGA-3: Omega XL ($88.18 per 1000 mgs omega-3) is the most expensive per 1000 mgs omega-3 of those in the comparison; followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.67 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 ($.64 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.57 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.51 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.44 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.38 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.19 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.19 per 1000 mgs omega-3); and followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.17 per 1000 mgs omega-3), which is the least expensive per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of those in the comparison.</p><p>PRICE PER PILL: Omega XL ($1.50 per gel cap) is the most expensive per pill of those in the comparison; followed by UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 ($.73 per gel cap); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.66 per gel cap); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.65 per gel cap); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.48 per gel cap); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.33 per gel cap); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.25 per gel cap); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.21 per gel cap); followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.15 per gel cap); and followed by Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.14 per gel cap), which is the least expensive per pill of those in the comparison.</p><p>Omega XL costs about 11 times the price per pill of the least expensive product in the comparison. There is no justification for that kind of price!</p><p>PRICE PER 1000 MGS OMEGA-3: is the most expensive per 1000 mgs omega-3 of those in the comparison; followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega ($.71 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 ($.64 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula ($.61 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega ($.51 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil ($.44 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil ($.38 per 1000 mgs omega-3); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold ($.19 per 1000 mgs omega-3) and Now Ultra Omega-3 ($.19 per 1000 mgs omega-3); and followed by Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 ($.17 per 1000 mgs omega-3), which is the least expensive per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of those in the comparison.</p><p>The price per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of Omega XL is 519 times the price per 1000 mgs of omega-3 of the least expensive product in the comparison. That is nothing short of price gouging. The money the company is paying Larry King is no doubt responsible, at least in part, for its outrageous price per 1000 mgs of omega-3!</p><p>PILL SIZE: OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil (1300 mgs) is the largest pill of those in the comparison; followed by UnoCardio 1000 + Vitamin D 1000 (1266 mgs); followed by Nutrigold Triple Strength Fish Oil Omega-3 Gold (1250 mgs); followed by Garden of Life Minami Nutrition Platinum Omega 3 Plus D3 Formula (1218 mgs); followed by Norwegian Gold Ultimate Fish Oils Super Critical Omega (1200 mgs) and Innovix Triple Strength Omega-3 (1200 mgs); followed by Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega (1000 mgs) and Now Ultra Omega-3 (1000 mgs); followed by Omapure Pharmaceutical Grade Omega-3 Fish Oil (900 mgs); and followed by Omega XL (150 mgs), which is the smallest pill of those in the comparison. In terms of size, all of these pills are manageable for most folks.</p><p>HUGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS: You really need to be careful with a product like this. One day it&rsquo;s selling for $90.00+ per bottle and the next day it&rsquo;s selling for $45.00+ per bottle. This is a trap. It&rsquo;s designed to lure an unsuspecting consumer into a purchase at an outrageous price. Either price, be it $45.00 per bottle or $90.00 per bottle, is nothing short of price gouging and a rip off.</p><p>SAME PRODUCT - DIFFERENT PRICE: This product is sold elsewhere on Amazon, usually at a substantially different price in the $43.00 - $50.00 range. See, Omega 3&rsquo;s Anti-Inflammatory 60ct Bottle, Arthritis Pain Relief, Most Concentrated Omega 3&rsquo;s Essential Fatty Acids</p><p>PRESSURE TACTICS: There appear to be a number of complaints about the company because of pressure tactics used in connection with the purchase of the product from the company. The complaint appears with sufficient frequency to lend credence to the claim.</p><p>PRODUCT SPECIALISTS: The company prides itself in announcing that it recently hired 150 product specialists to handle the volume of calls about the product. I did not find the company&rsquo;s product specialists knowledgeable, since they could not answer basic questions they should have been familiar with.</p><p>OMEGA-3 TEST: Anyone who is interested in having their omega-3 index tested can do so. A company called Omega Quant can provide the test. See, <a href=http://omegaquant.com/>http://omegaquant.com/</a>.</p><p>MEALS: These fatty acids based omega-3 products are best taken with a meal containing some fat, as they are more efficiently absorbed when taken with food.</p><p>OPINION: I would approach Omega XL with extreme caution. While the company claims it does not contain GMOs, cholesterol, or mercury, and it uses a proprietary Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 Technology, it is not IFOS certified, the precise makeup of the product is not clearly set forth or is completely omitted, its omega-3, EPA, and DHA content is abysmally small (11%), it is outrageously expensive ($1.50 per gel cap and $88.18 per 1000 mgs omega-3), particularly considering a starting dosage of four gel caps, it contains soy, and the product information provided about it lacks transparency.</p><p>I have some serious problems with this company and with this product and strongly recommend that it be avoided!</p><p><strong>RATING:</strong></p><p>I rated Omega XL one star for the reasons set forth above.</p><p>I rated OmegaVia Pharma-Grade Fish Oil five stars because it is IFOS five star rated, it has one of the highest omega-3 potencies on the market (85%), it uses Supercritical Dual-Process CO2 technology, it is soy free, it is GMO free, it is cholesterol free, it is mercury free, and it is enteric coated.
