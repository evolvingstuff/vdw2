#### The Conundrum of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Cancer Prevention Studies: Which One? How Much? What Biomarkers?

Cancer Prevention Research DOI: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-18-0061

Marine omega-3 fatty acids promote resolution of inflammation and have potential to reduce risk of obesity-related breast cancer. For prevention trials in obese women, inflammatory cytokines, aromatase, and measures of breast immune cell infiltration are logical, as are biomarkers of growth factor, adipokine, and estrogen signaling. Where best to look for marker change: in the circulation (easiest), in benign breast tissue (most relevant), or in visceral adipose (inflammation often most marked)? A null biomarker modulation trial may reflect limitations in design, source and dose of fatty acids, or biomarkers and should not lead to premature abandonment of marine omega-3 fatty acids for cancer prevention.

<span style="color:#00F;">“Animal model supplementation studies often first induce an inflammatory environment with a high fat diet and then administer combinations of DHA and EPA at 4% to 10% of feed by weight, usually in the range of 10% of calories for EPA and/or DHA (5, 8). Human supplementation studies with EPA and DHA, in contrast, often do not preselect for baseline inflammation and then dose in the range of 1% to 2% of calories (5). Those trials showing consistent modulation of tissue blood inflammatory biomarkers are generally in individuals with active inflammation and employ combined EPA þ DHA doses of 3.4 to 4.0 g/day or EPA or DHA alone 2.7 g/day (5, 12). There is little evidence of inflammatory biomarker modulation at doses <2 g/day”</span>
