 **Highlights** 

* Treatment with 10,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol was safe during severe COVID-19.

* Anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased in 10,000 IU/day group.

* Individuals who received 10,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol showed increased CD4 count.

* Individuals with ARDS in 10,000 IU/day group stayed at the hospital less time.

* The 10,000 IU/day group showed increased antiviral cytotoxic activity.

Main cause of severe illness and death in COVID-19 patients appears to be an excessive but ineffectual inflammatory immune response that may cause severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Vitamin D may favour an anti-inflammatory environment and improve cytotoxic response against some infectious diseases. A multicenter, single-blind, prospective, randomized clinical trial was approved in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) of 14.8 ng/mL (SD: 6.18) to test antiviral efficacy, tolerance and safety of 10,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) for 14 days, in comparison with 2,000 IU/day. 

After supplementation, mean serum 25(OH)D levels increased to 

* 19 ng/mL on average in 2,000 IU/day versus 

* 29 ng/mL in 10,000 IU/day group (p <0.0001). 

Although levels of inflammatory cytokines were not modified by treatment with 10,000 IU/day, there was an increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and higher levels of CD4+ T cells, with predominance of T central memory subpopulation. 

Cytotoxic response against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infected cells was increased more than  **4-fold in patients who received 10,000 IU/day** . Moreover, levels of IFN? were significantly higher in this group. 

Beneficial effect of supplementation with 10,000 IU/day was also observed in participants who developed ARDS and stayed at the hospital for **8.0 days** , whereas those who received 2,000 IU/day stayed for  **29.2 days**  (p=0.0381). Administration of high doses of vitamin D3 as adjuvant of the standard care treatment during hospitalization for COVID-19 may improve the inflammatory environment and cytotoxic response against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, shortening the hospital stay and, possibly, improving the prognosis.

The inclusion criteria for the participants in the study were being adults (>18 years old)  **hospitalized for at least seven days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms,**  which is when usually began the inflammatory phase, with a diagnosis of pneumonia due to COVID-19

 **Speculation:   
No hospitalization if had gotten high dose vitamin D at COVID symptom onset**
