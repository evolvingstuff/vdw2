#### A randomised trial of nutrient supplements to minimise psychological stress after a natural disaster.

Psychiatry Res. 2015 Aug 30;228(3):373-9. [doi: 10.1016/j.psychres.2015.05.080](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2015.05.080)

After devastating flooding in southern Alberta in June 2013, we attempted to replicate a New Zealand randomised trial that showed that micronutrient (minerals, vitamins) consumption after the earthquakes of 2010-11 resulted in improved mental health. Residents of southern Alberta were invited to participate in a study on the potential benefit of nutrient supplements following a natural disaster. Fifty-six adults aged 23-66 were randomised to receive a single nutrient (vitamin D, n=17), a few-nutrients formula (B-Complex, n=21), or a broad-spectrum mineral/vitamin formula (BSMV, n=18). Self-reported changes in depression, anxiety and stress were monitored for six weeks. Although all groups showed substantial decreases on all measures, those consuming the B-Complex and the BSMV formulas showed significantly greater improvement in stress and anxiety compared with those consuming the single nutrient, with large effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.76-1.08). There were no group differences between those consuming the B-Complex and BSMV. The use of nutrient formulas with multiple minerals and/or vitamins to minimise stress associated with natural disasters is now supported by three studies. Further research should be carried out to evaluate the potential population benefit that might accrue if such formulas were distributed as a post-disaster public health measure.

 **Notes:** 

only 1,000 IU in the vitamin D arm and a tiny 320 IU in the broad spectrum arm

Strangely none of the RCT arms has any Omega-3

##### Study was cited 58 times as of Dec 2023
