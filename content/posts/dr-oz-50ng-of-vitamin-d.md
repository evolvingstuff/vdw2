His video on  **Good Morning America**  gets many vitamin D ideas across very quickly (6 minutes)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D9aANoN0-Y

* Notes from that video:  (with some updated information)

He recommends > 50 ng/ml

10-15 minutes of sunlight when your shadow is shorter than you

&nbsp;an hour of sunlight is needed if your have dark skin

Just about guarantee that if you have dark skin or overweight you are vitamin D deficient

Cholesterol goes up in the winter to increase the amount to convert to vitamin D

He thinks that all milk just has the 'vegetarian" form = D2.  

(He was not aware that many milk producers now add D3 instead of D2)

Dr. Oz  father-in-law was taking 5,000 a day to replete

10,000 a day makes Dr. Oz really nervous, but overdosing with water is far easier

&nbsp; &nbsp;50X as much water will cause you to die faster than 50X as much vitamin D

Multivitamins only have 400 IU, which is not enough

(since this video a few multivitamins have 4000 IU)

He suggested cod liver oil to get vitamin D

(this video was made before the vitamin A problem of code liver oil was recognized)
