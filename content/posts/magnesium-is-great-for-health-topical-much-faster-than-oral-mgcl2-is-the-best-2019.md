#### The 4 ways the founder of VitaminDWiki gets his Magnesium

* I have found very quick benefit from MgCl applied to the skin 

   * Mixed in a [DMSO in Aloe vera Cream](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z7KME/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

   * Sore muscles eliminated in about 10 minutes

* I buy bulk [MgCl2 crystals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YQGLW38/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and disolve them in hot water for oral consumption

   * The excess MgCl2 precipitates out as the water cools.

* I buy [MgCl2 bath salts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J9ML9ZB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - It appears to be 4X lower cost than the oral grade

   * I take a MgCl2 bath about twice a month

* I buy [Magnesium Citrate Crystals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F7OZJR8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) and add them and 10 other supplements to the granola which I prepare each week
