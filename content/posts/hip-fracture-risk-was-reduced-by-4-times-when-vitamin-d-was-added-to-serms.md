#### Study: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with vitamin D composite agent can prevent fracture better than SERMs treatment:

 **based on the National Health Claims Database 2017-2019** 

Osteoporos Int  2024 Jan 19. [doi: 10.1007/s00198-024-07022-7](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-024-07022-7) [Can be viewed at DeepDyve 1 month free trial](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-serms-with-vitamin-d-composite-FCTILqFMaH?key=springer%20)

 **4X reduction in hip fractures in those who happened to be prescribed   
to take some  amount of Vitamin D in addition to SERMS**

With the analysis of nationwide health claim data, treatment with the composite agent of SERMs and vitamin D reduces the risk of osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture better compared to SERMs treatment in women with osteoporosis aged ≥ 50 years.

Purpose: This study compared the potential of the composite agent of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and vitamin D (SERM + VitD) with that of SERMs-only for fracture prevention and mortality reduction in women aged ≥ 50 years.

Methods: The incidence of osteoporotic fracture (fractures of the vertebrae, hip, wrist, or humerus) and all-cause death after treatment with SERM + VitD and SERMs were characterized using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database 2017-2019. The participants were divided into two groups (SERM + VitD vs SERMs). After exclusion and propensity score matching, 2,885 patients from each group were included in the analysis. Fracture incidence was compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to compare the risks of fracture occurrence and mortality between the groups.

Results: The incidence rate (138.6/10,000 vs. 192.4/10,000 person-years), and risk of osteoporotic fractures (hazard ratio <span>[HR]</span>, 0.77; 95% confidence interval <span>[CI]</span>, 0.61-0.97; p = 0.024) were lower in the SERM + VitD group than in the SERMs group. 

Analysis for specific fractures showed a  **lower hazard of hip fracture in the SERM + VitD group (HR, 0.25** ; 95% CI, 0.09-0.71; p = 0.009). No difference was observed between the groups regarding mortality.

Conclusion: The risk of osteoporotic fractures, especially hip fractures, was lower in the SERM + VitD group than in the SERMs group. Therefore, the composite agent of SERMs and vitamin D can be considered as a viable option for postmenopausal women with a relatively low fracture risk.
