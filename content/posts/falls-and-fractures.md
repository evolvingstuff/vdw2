##### Predict 30 day Hip fracture mortality – the only controllable variable is Vitamin D – Sept 2023

 **Emergency department prediction model for 30-day mortality after hip fracture: the Spanish National Hip Fracture Registry (RNFC) cohort**

Introduction: The aim of this study was to design and validate a predictive model for 30-day mortality in a cohort of patients from the Spanish National Hip Fracture Registry (RNFC) with variables collected at the Emergency Department.

Methods: Retrospective study of a prospective database of hip fracture patients ⩾75 years old between 1 January 2017 and 30 September 2019. Patient characteristics, type of fracture and osteoprotective medication were collected at the Emergency Department. Univariate analysis compared the results between patients alive and deceased 30 days after hospital discharge. 

The variables associated with 30-day mortality in the regression analysis were 

* age >85 years, 

* male sex, 

* indoors pre-fracture mobility,

* Dementia, 

* ASA score >3,

* pathological fracture, and

*  **vitamin D intake.**  Yes/No

A score scale was created with these variables. Discriminative performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration was assessed by applying Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and predicted-to-observed mortality was compared.

Results: A total of 29,875 hip fracture cases were included in the study. The 30-day mortality of the overall cohort was 7.7%. A scale of 0-9 points was created, with a cut-off point of 4 points for the determination of patients at high risk of mortality. The AUC was 0.886. RNFC score presented good level of calibration (p = 0.139). The predicted-to-observed ratio was 1.09.

Conclusions: The RNFC predictive model with variables collected at the Emergency Department showed an excellent predictive capacity for 30-day mortality in patients after hip fracture.

##### Hip fracture deaths 3X more likely in one year if low vitamin D – Feb 2023

 **Preoperative Vitamin D Deficiency is Associated with Increased One-Year Mortality in Chinese Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients - A Propensity Score Matching Study** 

Clin Interv Aging . 2023 Feb 18;18:263-272. [doi: 10.2147/CIA.S395228.](https://doi.org/10.2147/CIA.S395228.)

Background: Vitamin D deficiency is a common comorbidity in geriatric hip fracture patients. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding the influence of preoperative Vitamin D status on postoperative mortality in hip fracture patients.

Methods: Elderly patients (=60 years) who underwent surgical interventions for unilateral hip fracture from 2015 to 2020 in our center were included. We retrospectively retrieved the demographic data from the electronic medical database. Preoperative serum total 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D was set as the independent variable and patients were classified as the Vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/mL) and the control groups consequently. Clinical outcomes include all-cause mortality, walking ability, and major postoperative complications in the first postoperative year. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed in a ratio of 1:1 in the two groups for further comparison.

Results: A total of 210 patients were included and 121 patients (57.6%) were diagnosed with Vitamin D deficiency. Patients in the Vitamin D deficiency group were much older and therefore preferred peripheral nerve block, and had significantly higher proportions of females, preoperative dementia, higher ASA grade, and lower baseline serum albumin level. Overall, 79 patients were identified in the Vitamin D deficiency and control groups after PSM, respectively. 

Patients diagnosed with Vitamin D deficiency showed a  **significantly higher one-year mortality (21.5% vs 6.3%, P=0.011)**  and a much lower one-year independent walking rate (67.1% vs.84.8%, P=0.016) after the matching. Regarding the dataset before PSM and after PSM, the AUC for serum Vitamin D for predicting one-year mortality was 0.656 (P=0.006) and 0.695 (P=0.002), respectively.

Conclusion: Our retrospective PSM-design study provides new evidence that Vitamin D deficiency was associated with a significantly higher mortality and poor walking ability in the first year after surgical intervention based on southern Chinese populations.
