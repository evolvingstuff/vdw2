Given the dynamics of the decline in the birth rate in Ukraine during wartime and the demographic crisis, the issue of studying the factors of reproductive losses and creating effective measures for their prevention is an extremely urgent task. The purpose of the work is to assess the role of vitamin D in the development of fetal loss syndrome. A cohort study was conducted with the participation of 83 women of reproductive age from 21 to 42 years (on average - 30.86±5.02 years) with a history of fetal loss syndrome, who sought medical help from obstetric and gynecological hospitals in Vinnytsia during 2017-2022. The comparison group included 83 women with a normal course of pregnancy and childbirth. The level of vitamin D was assessed by the concentration of 25-OH vitamin D total (vitamin D2 and vitamin D3) in blood serum, which was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical processing of the obtained data was carried out using the statistical package of information processing SPSS 21 (©SPSS Inc.). The results of the study showed that the level of 25(OH)D was statistically significantly lower in the group of women with fetal loss syndrome, in particular with detected hemostasis disorders, compared with women with a normal course of pregnancy and childbirth (p<0.05). 

The average level of 25(OH)D in serum was 

* 21.74±9.37 ng/ml in women with fetal loss syndrome and 

* 38.31±5.96 ng/ml in patients of the comparison group. 

It was found that 77.1% of women with fetal loss syndrome had insufficiency (27.7%) or deficiency (49.4%) of vitamin D in serum. At the same time, in women of this category, the indicated vitamin D statuses were significantly more frequent than in women with a normal course of pregnancy and childbirth (OR 4.92; 95% CI <span>[1.88-12.8]</span> and OR 82.0; 95% CI <span>[10.89-617.3]</span>, respectively). Therefore, the conducted studies have established a significant relationship between vitamin D deficiency and fetal loss syndrome, in particular in women with hemostasis disorders, which requires studying the effectiveness of its use to improve pregnancy outcomes.
