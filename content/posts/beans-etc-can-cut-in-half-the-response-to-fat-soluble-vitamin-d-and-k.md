 **Saponins - web** 

* The main sources of saponins in human diet are legumes, mainly broad beans, kidney beans and lentils. Saponins are also present in Allium species (onion, garlic), asparagus, oats, spinach, sugarbeet, tea, yam, ginseng, liqorice, etc.

* It is widely advised to increase pulse consumption. However, pulses are rich in molecules displaying lipid-lowering properties, including fibers, phytates, saponins, and tannins. The effects of pulses on fat-soluble vitamin bioavailability were thus explored.

Methods

Vitamin A (β-carotene and retinyl palmitate), vitamin E (α-tocopherol), vitamin D (cholecalciferol), and vitamin K (phylloquinone) bioaccessibility was evaluated by assessing micellarization after in vitro digestion of meals containing either potatoes (control), household-cooked, or canned pulses. The obtained mixed micelles were delivered to Caco-2 cells to evaluate vitamin uptake. The impact of fibers, phytates, saponins, and tannins on both phylloquinone (used as a model vitamin) bioaccessibility and uptake were then specifically assessed.

Results

The presence of pulses significantly decreased both vitamin bioaccessibility (up to −65% for β-carotene, −69% for retinyl-palmitate, −45% for cholecalciferol, −53% for α-tocopherol and −67% for phylloquinone) and uptake (−40% for retinyl-palmitate, −67% for cholecalciferol, −50% for α-tocopherol and −57% for phylloquinone). Effects on bioaccessibility, but not on uptake, are dependent on pulse cooking method. Phylloquinone bioaccessibility is specifically impacted by saponins, tannins, and fibers while its uptake is impacted by saponins, fibers, and phytates.

Conclusion

Pulses can alter fat-soluble micronutrient bioavailability. Pulses should thus be cooked appropriately and consumed within micronutrient-rich meals.

!!!!The Presence of Pulses within a Meal can Alter Fat-Soluble Vitamin Bioavailability

__Saponins - web__
*The main sources of saponins in human diet are legumes, mainly broad beans, kidney beans and lentils. Saponins are also present in Allium species (onion, garlic), asparagus, oats, spinach, sugarbeet, tea, yam, ginseng, liqorice, etc.
*It is widely advised to increase pulse consumption. However, pulses are rich in molecules displaying lipid-lowering properties, including fibers, phytates, saponins, and tannins. The effects of pulses on fat-soluble vitamin bioavailability were thus explored.
Methods
Vitamin A (β-carotene and retinyl palmitate), vitamin E (α-tocopherol), vitamin D (cholecalciferol), and vitamin K (phylloquinone) bioaccessibility was evaluated by assessing micellarization after in vitro digestion of meals containing either potatoes (control), household-cooked, or canned pulses. The obtained mixed micelles were delivered to Caco-2 cells to evaluate vitamin uptake. The impact of fibers, phytates, saponins, and tannins on both phylloquinone (used as a model vitamin) bioaccessibility and uptake were then specifically assessed.

Results
The presence of pulses significantly decreased both vitamin bioaccessibility (up to −65% for β-carotene, −69% for retinyl-palmitate, −45% for cholecalciferol, −53% for α-tocopherol and −67% for phylloquinone) and uptake (−40% for retinyl-palmitate, −67% for cholecalciferol, −50% for α-tocopherol and −57% for phylloquinone). Effects on bioaccessibility, but not on uptake, are dependent on pulse cooking method. Phylloquinone bioaccessibility is specifically impacted by saponins, tannins, and fibers while its uptake is impacted by saponins, fibers, and phytates.

Conclusion
Pulses can alter fat-soluble micronutrient bioavailability. Pulses should thus be cooked appropriately and consumed within micronutrient-rich meals.
