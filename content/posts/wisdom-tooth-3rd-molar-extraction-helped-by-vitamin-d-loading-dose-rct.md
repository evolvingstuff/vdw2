The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect on the biochemical inflammatory markers of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol in vitamin D-deficient patients undergoing the surgical removal of lower third molars. A randomized, split-mouth, single-blind study was conducted on 25 vitamin D-deficient patients ranging between 18 and 40 years of age requiring lower third molars extraction and referred at the Oral Surgery Unit of the School of Dentistry of the University of Messina. All patients, with vitamin D3 blood levels ?30?ng/mL, underwent bilateral surgical removal. The first extraction (control group) being conducted with the administration of a placebo, the second one (test group) being conducted with the preliminary administration of  **300,000 IU**  of cholecalciferol 4 days before the procedure. At each surgery, clinical indexes, such as pain, edema and any functional limitation have been recorded. Clinical and biochemical parameters were registered 4 days before, immediately after, 3 and 7 days after the surgical procedure. The data obtained were processed using paired t-test. The clinical outcome parameters showed a slight to moderate improvement between the control and the vitamin-D treatment group, with statistical significance being obtained regarding the  **edema**  at defined time points. Interleukin-1-beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha values were significantly lower (P?<?0.01) for the test group after the surgery. The increase of vitamin D serum levels showed an impact on the outcome of the third molar surgery, eliciting a  **reduced inflammatory response and leading to a more favorable clinical course.**
