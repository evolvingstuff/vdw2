#### Vitamin D Insufficiency Prior to Paediatric Liver Transplantation Is Associated with Early T-Cell Mediated Rejection

Objectives: T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) can compromise long-term liver allograft survival. The immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D are increasingly recognized. We investigated whether perturbations in vitamin D metabolism prior to LT may predispose to TCMR in a representative cohort of paediatric LT recipients. 

Methods: In this retrospective single-center study of children who underwent liver transplantation between 2005 and 2017, we collected serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels and other parameters related to vitamin D metabolism. Post-transplant variables were collected from medical records during the first year following LT. 

Results: Eighty-two patients were included. Twenty-six (32%) developed TCMR, 52 (65%) presented at least one event of 25(OH) D insufficiency during the year before the transplant, while 23 (32%) had at least one documented elevated plasma parathyroid hormone level. Forty-six patients benefited from nutritional support (56%). The development of TCMR was associated with vitamin D insufficiency pre-LT (p = 0.01). No significant correlations were identified between PTH levels and incidence of TCMR. The association was stronger in patients transplanted for cholestatic diseases (p = 0.004). 

Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency before a liver transplant may be associated with TCMR during the first year post-LT. These findings warrant further investigation.
