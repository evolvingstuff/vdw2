Introduction

A large proportion of asthma patients remain uncontrolled despite using inhaled corticosteroids. Some add-on therapies such as vitamin D supplements have been recommended for this subgroup of patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-utility of vitamin D supplementation in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma in Colombia.

Methods

A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. The model was analyzed probabilistically, and a value of information (VOI) analysis was conducted to inform the value of conducting further research to reduce current uncertainties in the evidence base. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) value of US$5180.

Results

The mean incremental cost of vitamin D supplementation versus no supplementation is USD $44.60. The mean incremental benefit of vitamin D supplementation versus no supplementation is 0.05 QALY. This position of absolute dominance (vitamin D supplementation has lower costs and higher QALYs than no supplementation) is unnecessary to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Our base-case results were robust to variations in all assumptions and parameters.

Conclusion

Add-on therapy with vitamin D supplementation is a cost-effective strategy for patients between 6 and 17 years of age with mild to moderate asthma in Colombia.
