##### Some reasons for not getting >8% when taking lots of Omega-3

1. Taking an oil form of Omega-3 without a fatty meal

> Emulsified forms of Omega-3 do not require fatty meals nor gall bladders

> But, they are more expensive: [Coromega](https://www.amazon.com/Coromega-Concentrate-Absorption-Inflammatory-Supplement/dp/B01M03VMSJ/ref=sr_1_21?crid=18QYY2C6TKWWV&keywords=omega%2B3%2Bfish%2Boil%2Bemulsified&qid=1703510253&sprefix=omega-3%2Bemu%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-21&th=1), for example, costs $0.86/day

1. Having a diet with excessive [Omega-6, which blocks Omega-3](/posts/omega-6-blocks-omega-3-etc-many-studies)

> Omega-6 oils to avoid: Corn, Saflower, Sunflower

1. Alcohol and caffeine can also interfere with Omega-3 absorption

#### Chat-GPT:bioavailability of Omega-3   (Dec 2023)

The bioavailability of Omega-3 fatty acids can be influenced by several factors:

1.  **Form of Omega-3:**  Omega-3 fatty acids are available in different forms, such as ethyl esters (EE), triglycerides (TG), and phospholipids (PL). The form can affect how well they are absorbed in the body. Typically, triglycerides and phospholipids are better absorbed than ethyl esters.

1.  **Food Matrix:**  Omega-3s consumed as part of a whole food (like fish) may be more bioavailable than those consumed as a supplement. The presence of other fats, proteins, and dietary fibers in the food can affect absorption.

1.  **Overall Diet:**  A diet high in saturated fats and low in healthy fats can reduce the absorption of Omega-3s. Additionally, the balance of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids in the diet is important. A high ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 can interfere with the metabolism and utilization of Omega-3 fatty acids.

1.  **Digestive Health:**  Conditions that affect fat absorption, such as pancreatic enzyme deficiency, cystic fibrosis, or Crohn's disease, can impair the absorption of Omega-3s.

1.  **Alcohol Consumption:**  Excessive alcohol intake can negatively impact the digestion and absorption of fats, including Omega-3 fatty acids.

1.  **Cooking Methods:**  Overcooking fish or using certain cooking methods might damage Omega-3 fats. Gentle cooking methods, like steaming or grilling, are better at preserving these nutrients.

1.  **Storage Conditions:**  Omega-3s are sensitive to light, heat, and oxygen. Poor storage conditions can lead to oxidation of these fatty acids, reducing their effectiveness and bioavailability.

To maximize the bioavailability of Omega-3s, it's generally recommended to consume them as part of a balanced diet that includes whole food sources like fish, and to be mindful of cooking and storage methods. For those who take supplements, choosing a high-quality product in an easily absorbable form is important.
