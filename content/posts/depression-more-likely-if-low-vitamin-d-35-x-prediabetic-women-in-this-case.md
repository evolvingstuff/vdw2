#### Association between serum 25 (OH) D levels and depression symptoms in adults with prediabetes

Diabetes Metab Syndr. 2022 Oct 13;16(11):102642. [doi: 10.1016/j.dsx.2022.102642](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2022.102642) pdf behind a paywell

Background and aim: Depression symptoms are a significant risk factor for prediabetes-related diabetes, and low vitamin D levels are connected with depression symptoms. The goal of this study is to examine the association between vitamin D and depression symptoms in prediabetic persons.

Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Tianjin, China, among 4051 individuals. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) (cut-off point SDS ≥45). Serum 25 (OH) D concentrations were determined using an enzyme immunoassay (OCTEIA 25-hydroxy Vitamin D, IDS Ltd, UK) and classified into three levels: 50 nmol/L, 50-75 nmol/L, and >75 nmol/L. The link between serum 25 (OH) D concentrations and depression symptoms in prediabetes was investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis. The models were adjusted for a variety of potential confounders.

Results: The prevalence of symptoms of depression in prediabetic adults was 14.2% (12.5% males and 16.4% females). After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, the odds ratios - ORs for symptoms of depression in women across serum 25 (OH) D levels were 1.00 (reference), 1.03 (0.57, 1.39), and 0.28 (0.12, 0.57), respectively (p = 0.0015). However, no statistically significant connection was discovered in males.

Conclusion: In women with prediabetes, we showed a substantial negative connection between serum 25 (OH) D levels and depressed symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation may be an effective way to decrease the risk of depression symptoms in women with prediabetes.
