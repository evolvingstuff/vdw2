Hypovitaminosis D in the elderly causes falls and fractures as a result of impaired neuromuscular functions and also may be a reason for nonspecific musculosceletal pain. The aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of a single dose per os or parenterally administrated vitamin D on increasing the quality of life and functional mobility and decreasing the pain in the elderly. 

The community-dwelling elderly subjects over 65 years age were included in the study. 

The subjects were given  **300.000 IU**  Vitamin D via per os and parenteral route and assessed after 4 weeks. 

The serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, ALT, ALP, 24-h urine calcium excretion, PTH, and vitamin D levels, as well as VAS (visual analog scale) for pain assessment, functional mobility with TUG (timed up and go test) and quality of life with SF-36 before and after the treatment were evaluated. The serum vitamin D levels were measured by the RIA method. The subjects were divided into four groups each consisting of 30 subjects. 

* The 1st group took i.m. vitamin D, 

* the 2nd group took i.m. placebo, 

* the 3rd group took p.o. vitamin D, and 

* the 4th group took p.o. placebo. 

The mean age of all the participants was 70.1 ± 4.3 years. 

There was no difference in the age and gender between the groups (P > 0.05). After treatment, the PTH level of first group was decreased (P = 0.0001) and the vitamin D level increased (P = 0.0001) significantly. In the third group, the PTH level of first group was decreased (P = 0.0001) and the vitamin D level increased (P = 0.004) and the 24-h calcium excretion in urine (P = 0.015) increased significantly. When the pain, the functional mobility, and the quality of life were evaluated, in 

the first group, the TUG (P = 0.0001) and the VAS (P = 0.0001) decreased significantly, whereas the SF-36 subtitles: physical functioning (P = 0.0001), role physical (0.006), bodily pain (P = 0.0001), general health (P = 0.007), social functioning (P = 0.05), and mental health (P = 0.048) increased significantly. 

In group two,  **{im placebo?}**  the VAS (P = 0.001) decreased, the role physical (P = 0.009), and role emotional (P = 0.034) increased significantly; In group three, the TUG (P = 0.0001) and the VAS (P = 0.002) decreased, whereas the physical function (P = 0.0001) and role physical (0.001) increased significantly; 

In group four, the VAS (P = 0.007) decreased significantly. 

The megadose vitamin D administration 

* increases quality of life, 

* decreases pain, and 

* improves functional mobility via po or im route in the elderly.

   * Such a megadose would probably also help others at risk of being vitamin D deficient
