Background/aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D on the disease prognosis and biochemical parameters in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome(OSAS).

Materials and methods: Nineteen adult male individuals(18-65 years) who were diagnosed with mild OSAS after polysomnography and had low vitamin D levels were included in the study. Each week, patients took 50.000 IU Vitamin D3 supplementation for 8 weeks. Polysomnography, biochemical parameters FBG (fasting blood glucose), lipid profile (TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL-C), calcium, phosphorus, parathormone, calcitonin, serum 25(OH)D, insulin, CRP, TNF-?, IL-6 and IL-10 of patients were evaluated at the beginning of study and at the end of the study. All assessments, including polysomnography, were repeated after 8 weeks.

Results: Serum vitamin D levels were initially 19.5 ± 5.01 ng / mL and increased to 41.8 ± 10.51 ng / mL (p <0.001) at the end of the study. FBG, TC and HOMA-IR of the patients were significantly decreased (p <0.05). CRP,TNF-?, IL-6 and IL-10 levels were also correlated with serum vitamin D levels (p <0.05). There was a significant decrease in number of obstructive apneas, apneas and hypopneas, apnea index, hypopnea index and apnea hypopnea index of the patients (p <0.05).

Conclusion: As a result, it is thought that vitamin D supplementation may have a positive effect on the disease prognosis of mild OSAS.
