# Food Allergy: An Increasing Problem for the Elderly.

As populations become older all over the world, allergic reactions in elderly persons will be encountered more often in the future. Up to now, there has been much more literature on allergy prevalence in childhood than on allergy diseases in adults. 

As a challenge to epidemiology, allergic disorders in elderly persons may be masked by various symptoms corresponding with a general age-induced decline of physiological functions, including  **vitamin D deficiency**  and gastric pH increase. 

How much structural and functional changes (e.g. low calcitriol level) or effects caused by drugs (e.g. acid-suppression medications) in addition to immunological alterations encountered at old age are responsible for this development is a matter of debate. In the years ahead, the problem of allergy in adulthood and especially in the elderly will become more pronounced. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel. PMID: 20551623
