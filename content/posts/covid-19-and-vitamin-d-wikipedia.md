Oral vitamin D tablets

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been interest in [vitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) status and supplements, given the significant overlap in the risk factors for severe COVID-19 and [vitamin D deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D_deficiency).<sup>[188]</sup> These include obesity, older age, and Black or Asian ethnic origin, and it is notable that [vitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) deficiency is particularly common within these groups.<sup>[188]</sup>

The [National Institutes of Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health) (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines stated in July 2020 that "there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19."<sup>[189]</sup>

The general recommendation to consider taking vitamin D supplements, particularly given the levels of vitamin D deficiency in Western populations, has been repeated.<sup>[190]</sup> As of February 2021, the English [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Care_Excellence) (NICE) continued to recommend small doses of supplementary vitamin D for people with little exposure to sunshine, but recommended that practitioners should not offer a vitamin D supplement solely to prevent or treat COVID-19, except as part of a clinical trial.<sup>[190]</sup>

Multiple studies have reported links between pre-existing vitamin D deficiency and the severity of the disease. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these show that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a higher probability of becoming infected with COVID-19, and have clearly demonstrated there are significant associations between deficiency and a greater severity of the disease, including relative increases in hospitalization and mortality rates of about 80%.<sup>[191]</sup> <sup>[192]</sup> <sup>[193]</sup> The quality of some of the studies included and whether this demonstrates a causal relationship has been questioned.<sup>[194]</sup>

Many [clinical trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research) are underway or have been completed assessing the use of oral vitamin D and its metabolites such as [calcifediol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcifediol) for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 infection, especially in people with vitamin D deficiency.<sup>[195]</sup> <sup>[196]</sup> <sup>[188]</sup> <sup>[197]</sup>

The effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on the need for [intensive care unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit) (ICU) admission and mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients has been the subject of a meta-analysis.<sup>[198]</sup> A much lower ICU admission rate was found in patients who received vitamin D supplementation, which was only 36% of that seen in patients without supplementation (p<0.0001).<sup>[198]</sup> No significant effects on mortality were found in this meta-analysis.<sup>[198]</sup> The certainty of these analyses is limited by the heterogenicity in the studies which include both vitamin D3 ([cholecalciferol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol)) and calcifediol, but these findings indicate a potential role in improving COVID-19 severity, with more robust data being required to substantiate any effects on mortality.<sup>[198]</sup> <sup>[199]</sup>

Calcifediol, which is [25-hydroxyvitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25-hydroxyvitamin_D), is more quickly activated,<sup>[200]</sup> and has been used in several trials.<sup>[196]</sup> Review of the published results suggests that calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on the risk of ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients.<sup>[194]</sup>
