#### Vitamin D and infertility

Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol . 2023 May 22. [doi: 10.1097/GCO.0000000000000887](https://doi.org/10.1097/GCO.0000000000000887)

Purpose of review: Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated as a contributing factor to a spectrum of reproductive health burden, including 

* difficulty conceiving, 

* pathogenesis of gynaecological disorders such as 

   * uterine fibroids and endometriosis, to 

* metabolic and endocrine burden of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Recent findings: There have been recent publications showing that in infertile women who are supplemented with vitamin D, 

* there are higher pregnancy rates;

* there are improved ovarian reserve parameters in women with diminished ovarian reserve; 

* curtailed fibroid growth in those with uterine myomas; 

* lessened dysmenorrhea in endometriosis patients; and 

* improved menstrual regularity,

* lowered testosterone, AMH and insulin levels in women with PCOS.

In infertile men, sperm parameters, especially motility, are positively correlated with vitamin D serum levels.

Summary: Vitamin D status appears to be relevant to reproductive physiology, and to physiological processes underlying common gynaecological disorders as well as for reproductive success.
