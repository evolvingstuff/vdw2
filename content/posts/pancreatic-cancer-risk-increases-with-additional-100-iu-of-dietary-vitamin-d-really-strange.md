BACKGROUND:

The potential role of vitamin D in the aetiology of pancreatic cancer is unclear, with recent studies suggesting both positive and negative associations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

We used data from 9 case-control studies from the International Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4) to examine associations between pancreatic cancer risk and dietary vitamin D intake. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, and ORs were then pooled using a random effects model. From a subset of 4 studies, we also calculated pooled estimates of association for supplementary and total vitamin D intake.

RESULTS:

Risk of pancreatic cancer increased with dietary intake of vitamin D (per 100 international units (IU)/day: OR=1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19, p=7.4×10-6, p-heterogeneity=0.52; ≥230 vs <110 IU/day: OR=1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.55, p=2.4×10-3, p-heterogeneity=0.81), with the association possibly stronger in people with low retinol / vitamin A intake.

CONCLUSION:

Increased risk of pancreatic cancer was observed with higher levels of dietary vitamin D intake. Additional studies are required to determine whether or not our finding has a causal basis.
