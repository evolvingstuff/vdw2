There appear to be several ways to block damaging UVA while passing the UVB which provides vitamin D and long term tanning

1. Pill with natural  **antioxidents** 

1. Cream with natural  **antioxidents** 

1. A special sunscreen which blocks UVA, but not UVB

##  **1. 1** 

In Jan 2012 I became aware of a  **pill** which provides some protection of damage of the skin from the sun.

The pill contains natural  **antioxidents** which reduce skin damage for both UVA and UVB rays WITHOUT decreasing the amount of UVB (read that as Vitamin D) that the skin receives.

You need to have been taking the pill for several weeks for the protection to build up.

It appears to reduce the amount of skin damage by 3X, that is, it  **allows you to get 3X as much vitamin D from the sun before getting any skin damage.** 

It might decrease photosensitivity.

The pill is available for $30 and $4 shipping in the US. By the middle of 2012 they hope ship to other countries.

## Would have been nice to have had a sunscreen which blocked just UVA,

Unfortunately, most <a href="/posts/suncreens-block-both-uva-and-uvb" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" title="This link has an unknown page_id: 1075">suncreens block both UVA and UVB</a>

Some sunscreens block UVB more than UVA - the exact opposite of what is  **<span style="color:#F00;">wanted (dashed line)</span>**

### [Many sunscreen products do NOT block the upper UVA](http://www.rmsunscreen.com/productspecs.aspx)

 **This might be the reason that as people feel that they can stay out in the sun longer they get more cancer while getting less vitamin D**
