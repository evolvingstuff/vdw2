In fact, growing evidence suggests a link between low vitamin D levels and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, but whether this is a cause-and-effect relationship is unknown.</p><p>That’s why neurologist Marian Evatt, MD, and her colleagues are <strong>conducting a clinical trial</strong> exploring the effects of vitamin D supplementation on patients with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease who have low vitamin D levels. The study also includes further epidemiological studies of vitamin D in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p><p>Vitamin D is called a vitamin, but that’s a misnomer. It’s actually a steroid hormone, which we make by exposing our skin to sunshine. But no matter what it’s called, vitamin D is fundamental for growth, development, and cell maintenance throughout life, and even before birth.</p><p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease affects nerve cells in several parts of the brain, particularly those that use the chemical messenger dopamine to control movement. The most common symptoms are tremor, stiffness and slowness of movement.</p><p>In addition to getting vitamin D from sunshine, fatty fish or fortified foods such as milk and cereals can be a good source of D. “Vitamin D has become associated with many chronic diseases: diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and some of the autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis,” says Evatt. “But we haven’t yet determined the specific effect of vitamin D in specific conditions because it has such broad effects.”</p><hr><h4 id=clinical-intervention-trial-by-dr-evatt-for-the-vahttpclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct00571285termnct00571285rank1><a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00571285?term=NCT00571285&amp;rank=1">Clinical Intervention Trial by Dr. Evatt for the VA</a></h4><p>7743 IU vitamin D daily, 6 months, no loading dose</p><p>Contacts: Elaine Sperin, LPN esperin@emory.edu; Shirley Triche, RN, FNP striche@emory.edu</p><hr><h4 id=clinical-intervention-trial-at-another-va-locationhttpclinicaltrialsgovct2resultstermnct01119131searchsearch-to-be-completed-2015><a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT01119131&amp;Search=Search">Clinical Intervention Trial at another VA location</a> to be completed 2015</h4><p>10,000 vitamin D daily, 4 months, no loading dose VA Portland Oregon Brenna M Lobb (503) 220-8262 ext 51871 Brenna.Lobb@va.gov</p><hr><h4 id=the-kinase-lrrk2-mutated-in-parkinsons-disease-is-required-for-vitamin-d3-and-phosphate-metabolism---2013>THE KINASE LRRK2, MUTATED IN PARKINSONS DISEASE, IS REQUIRED FOR VITAMIN D3 AND PHOSPHATE METABOLISM - 2013</h4><p>Acta Physiologica 2013; Volume 207, Supplement 694, 92nd Annual Meeting of the German Physiological Society, 02/03/2013-05/03/2013, Heidelberg, Germany</p><p>Mühlemann 1 R. , Minder 1 N., Bettoni 1 C., Ruminska 1 J., Daryadel 1 A., Schnitzbauer 1 U., Kumar 1 M., Mohebbi 1 N., Biber 1 J., Hernando 1 N., Rovelli 2 G., Shimshek 2 D., van der Putten 2 H., Wagner 1 *C.</p><p>1 University of Zurich, Institute of Physiology, Zurich, Switzerland</p><p>2 Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland</p><p>Mutations in the Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase (LRRK2, Park8) underlie about 5 % of familial and 1-2 % of sporadic cases of Parkinson disease (PD). LRRK2 is almost ubiquitously expressed with particularly high levels in kidney, lung, and brain. The role of LRRK2, its up- and downstream regulators and targets are unknown. Here we show in mice either lacking Lrrk2 or expressing the G2019S mutant (the most common mutation in PD patients) and in rats deficient for LRRK2 that phosphate metabolism is highly disturbed. The levels of PTH, FGF23, and 1,25OH2-vitamin D3 are altered in all three animal models. Renal phosphate excretion is increased in animals lacking Lrrk2 and decreased in G2019S mutants. Expression of the vitamin D receptor and the vitamin D activating and inactivating enzymes Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1, as well as of klotho (coligand for FGF23) are altered in most organs expressing LRRK2. Changes in dietary phosphate intake in Lrrk2 WT and KO mice alter phosphate and vitamin D target genes in a LRRK2 dependent manner and application of vitamin D3 to wildtype mice increases LRRK2 expression. In vitro, inhibition of LRRK2 alters expression of Cyp24a1 and the intestinal phosphate transporter NaPiIIb. Our data suggest that LRRK2 plays a central role in regulating phosphate metabolism and hormones involved in its control.!</p><hr><h4 id=25-hydroxyvitamin-d-depletion-does-not-exacerbate-mptp-induced-dopamine-neuron-damage-in-mice--2012--span-stylecolor00fevattspan>25-Hydroxyvitamin D depletion does not exacerbate MPTP-induced dopamine neuron damage in mice. – 2012 <strong><span style=color:#00f>Evatt</span></strong></h4><p>PLoS One. 2012;7(7):e39227. <a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0039227.>doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0039227.</a> Epub 2012 Jul 2.</p><p>Dean ED, Mexas LM, Cápiro NL, McKeon JE, DeLong MR, Pennell KD, Doorn JA, Tangpricha V, Miller GW, <strong>Evatt</strong> ML.</p><p>Recent clinical evidence supports a link between 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <span>[25(OH)D]</span> levels &lt;30 ng/mL) and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND</p><p>PATIENTS The Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP) cohort is a well-characterized cohort of subjects with early, nondisabling PD. The cohort is well suited for examining the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency early in the course of the disease. We conducted a survey study of vitamin D status in stored blood samples from patients with PD enrolled in the placebo group of the DATATOP trial. Samples from baseline visits and end point/final visits (mean <span>[SD]</span>, 18.9 <span>[13.1]</span> months) were analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25<span>[OH]</span>D) concentration in blinded fashion.</p><p>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean vitamin D concentration and the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency at baseline and end point/final visits.</p><p>RESULTS: Among 199 subjects, 170 (85.4%) had samples from the baseline and end point visits available for analysis; 13 were excluded (10 with low probability of having PD and 3 with 25<span>[OH]</span>D concentrations>3 SDs above the mean). In the remaining 157 subjects, the mean (SD) 25(OH)D concentrations at the baseline and end point visits were 26.3 (8.6) ng/mL and 31.3 (9.0) ng/mL, respectively (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496). The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (25<span>[OH]</span>D concentration&lt;30.0 ng/mL) was 69.4% at baseline and 51.6% at the end point.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in patients with early PD was similar to or higher than those reported in previous studies. Vitamin D concentrations did not decline during progression of PD.

During the 29-year follow-up period, 50 incident Parkinson disease cases occurred. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was determined from frozen samples stored at baseline. Estimates of the relationship between serum vitamin D concentration and Parkinson disease incidence were calculated using the Cox model.</p><p>Participants Three thousand one hundred seventy-three men and women, aged 50 to 79 years and free of Parkinson disease at baseline.</p><p>Main Outcome Measure Parkinson disease incidence.</p><p>Results Individuals with higher serum vitamin D concentrations showed a reduced risk of Parkinson disease. The relative risk between the highest and lowest quartiles was 0.33 (95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.80) after adjustment for sex, age, marital status, education, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, smoking, body mass index, and month of blood draw.</p><p>Conclusions The results are consistent with the suggestion that high vitamin D status provides protection against Parkinson disease. It cannot, however, be excluded that the finding is due to residual confounding and further studies are thus needed.</p><p>Vitamin D plays an important role in the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders and calcium homeostasis.1 Vitamin D inadequacy also predicts increased risk of other chronic conditions, eg, cancer,2 cardiovascular diseases,3 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.4 Recently, chronically inadequate vitamin D intake was proposed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease.5 According to the suggested biological mechanism, Parkinson disease may be caused by a continuously inadequate vitamin D status leading to a chronic loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The epidemiological evidence of an association between vitamin D and Parkinson disease is, however, limited to cross-sectional studies6- 8 showing lower vitamin D status in patients with Parkinson disease compared with healthy controls.</p><p>Parkinson disease is a major cause of disability in elderly individuals. Its risk factors are relatively unknown. However, both biological plausibility and epidemiological data indicate that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to its development.5 The present cohort study investigated whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level predicts Parkinson disease incidence in a population from northern latitudes where exposure to the sun is limited and therefore vitamin D status is continuously low.</p><p><strong><span style=color:#00f>PDF is attached at the bottom of this page</span></strong></p></div><hr class=tag-separator><div class=tags><span>Tags: </span><span class=tag>alcohol</span>
