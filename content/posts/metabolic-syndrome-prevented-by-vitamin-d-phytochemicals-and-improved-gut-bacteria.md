#### Prevention of Metabolic Syndrome by Phytochemicals and Vitamin D

Review Int J Mol Sci . 2023 Jan 30;24(3):2627. [doi: 10.3390/ijms24032627.](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24032627.)

In recent years, attention has focused on the roles of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables in maintaining and improving the intestinal environment and preventing metabolic syndrome. A high-fat and high-sugar diet, lack of exercise, and excess energy accumulation in the body can cause metabolic syndrome and induce obesity, diabetes, and disorders of the circulatory system and liver. Therefore, the prevention of metabolic syndrome is important. The current review shows that the simultaneous intake of phytochemicals contained in citruses and grapes together with vitamin D improves the state of gut microbiota and immunity, preventing metabolic syndrome and related diseases. 

Phytochemicals contained in 

* citruses include polyphenols such as hesperidin, rutin, and naringin; those in 

* grapes include quercetin, procyanidin, and oleanolic acid. 

The intake of these phytochemicals and vitamin D, along with prebiotics and probiotics, nurture good gut microbiota. In general, 

Firmicutes are obese-prone gut microbiota and Bacteroidetes are lean-prone gut microbiota; good gut microbiota nurture regulatory T cells, which suppress inflammatory responses and upregulate immunity. Maintaining good gut microbiota suppresses TNF-α, an inflammatory cytokine that is also considered to be a pathogenic contributor adipokine, and prevents chronic inflammation, thereby helping to prevent metabolic syndrome. Maintaining good gut microbiota also enhances adiponectin, a protector adipokine that prevents metabolic syndrome. For the prevention of metabolic syndrome and the reduction of various disease risks, the intake of phytochemicals and vitamin D will be important for human health in the future.

In recent years, attention has focused on the roles of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables in maintaining and improving the intestinal environment and preventing metabolic syndrome. A high-fat and high-sugar diet, lack of exercise, and excess energy accumulation in the body can cause metabolic syndrome and induce obesity, diabetes, and disorders of the circulatory system and liver. Therefore, the prevention of metabolic syndrome is important. The current review shows that the simultaneous intake of phytochemicals contained in citruses and grapes together with vitamin D improves the state of gut microbiota and immunity, preventing metabolic syndrome and related diseases. 

Phytochemicals contained in 
*citruses include polyphenols such as hesperidin, rutin, and naringin; those in 
*grapes include quercetin, procyanidin, and oleanolic acid. 
The intake of these phytochemicals and vitamin D, along with prebiotics and probiotics, nurture good gut microbiota. In general, 

Firmicutes are obese-prone gut microbiota and Bacteroidetes are lean-prone gut microbiota; good gut microbiota nurture regulatory T cells, which suppress inflammatory responses and upregulate immunity. Maintaining good gut microbiota suppresses TNF-α, an inflammatory cytokine that is also considered to be a pathogenic contributor adipokine, and prevents chronic inflammation, thereby helping to prevent metabolic syndrome. Maintaining good gut microbiota also enhances adiponectin, a protector adipokine that prevents metabolic syndrome. For the prevention of metabolic syndrome and the reduction of various disease risks, the intake of phytochemicals and vitamin D will be important for human health in the future.
