Studies related to vitamin D deficiency and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children have inconsistent findings. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in children with LRTI, and to evaluate the correlation between vitamin D levels and the incidence and severity of LRTI. A total of 12 studies enrolling 2279 participants were included in our analysis. Children with LRTI were found to have significantly lower mean vitamin D levels as compared to controls There was likewise a correlation between vitamin D levels and incidence and severity of LRTI. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate effect of vitamin D supplementation for LRTI.
