#### Vitamin D and subsequent all-age and premature mortality: a systematic review.

BMC Public Health. 2013 Jul 24;13(1):679. 

Rush L, McCartney G, Walsh D, Mackay D.

BACKGROUND: All-cause mortality in the population < 65 years is 30% higher in Glasgow than in equally deprived Liverpool and Manchester. We investigated a hypothesis that low vitamin D in this population may be associated with premature mortality via a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and grey literature sources were searched until February 2012 for relevant studies. 

Summary statistics were combined in an age-stratified meta-analysis.

RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing 24,297 participants, 5,324 of whom died during follow-up. The pooled hazard ratio for low compared to high vitamin D demonstrated a significant inverse association (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27) between vitamin D levels and all-cause mortality after adjustment for available confounders. In an age-stratified meta-analysis, the  **hazard ratio for older participants was 1.25** (95% CI 1.14-1.36) and for younger participants 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.24).

CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin D status is inversely associated with all-cause mortality but the risk is higher amongst older individuals and the relationship is prone to residual confounding. Further studies investigating the association between vitamin D deficiency and all-cause mortality in younger adults with adjustment for all important confounders (or using randomised trials of supplementation) are required to clarify this relationship.
