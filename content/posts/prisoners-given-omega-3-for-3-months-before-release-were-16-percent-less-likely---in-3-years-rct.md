Objectives

While three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted using omega-3 supplementation on prison populations, none have examined effects on recidivism. This study presents pilot findings on recidivism rates following omega-3 and vitamin D supplementation.

Methods

Young offenders (N = 145) were randomized into 3 groups: omega-3/vitamin D supplementation (N = 48), placebo (N = 46), and treatment-as-usual controls (N = 51). One-, two-, and three-year recidivism rates were calculated.

Results

The omega-3 group showed non-significantly reduced recidivism rates compared to both control groups in all three years. Three-year recidivism reduction effect sizes were as follows: omega-3 versus controls (d = .18) and omega-3 versus placebo (d = .17).

Conclusions

A future study with a sample size of 237 would have a power of .80 to detect these effect sizes. These pilot data suggest that omega-3 and vitamin D supplementation, a simple and relatively cheap health intervention, could reduce 3-year recidivism by 16.6%.

* Singapore prisoners in their early 20’s

* For the treat­ment condition only, a total of 840 mg of omega-3 

   * (300 mg of DHA, 300 mg of EPA, 180 mg of alpha-linolenic acid, and 60 mg of DPA) was added to the base drink.

##### Suspect even fewer returns to prison if 1) add Vitamin D, 2) continue supplements after leave prison

Estimate of Return on Investment if 25% relative reduction (15% actual)

For simplicity, assume save 1 year of prison time

Assume cost of keeping a prisioner is $50,000/year

Assume cost of 6 months of supplement = $32

Assume give to 100 prisoners 

Total cost of supplements for 100 prisoners = $3,200

Total prison years saved due to supplement = 15 years  = 100 X 15%

Total cost of prison years saved =$750,000 = 15 years X $50,000/year

###### ROI = $234 saved for $1 invested
