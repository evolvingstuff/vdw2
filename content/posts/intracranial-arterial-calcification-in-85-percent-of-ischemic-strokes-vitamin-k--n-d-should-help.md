 **Although intracranial arterial calcifications (IACs) are encountered in approximately 85% of patients with acute ischemic stroke**  (IS), the significance of IAC in plaque instability is still controversial. Because most tissues including brain tissue have vitamin D receptors, vitamin D deficiency might play multiple roles in variable sites. Here, we report a novel presentation of IS with IAC including anterior cerebral artery involvement due to vitamin D deficiency.

In conclusion, although the role of IAC in cerebral infarction is still controversial, we suggest that insufficient vitamin D should be examined and treated appropriately in all patients with IS. We believe that this article provides important implications for the treatment of vitamin D deficiency in patients with IS.
